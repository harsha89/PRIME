      "Content": "Hi all, I'm in the incredibly lucky position to have my other half who is a Clinical Hypnotherapist, and his sister, who is an Acupuncturist! I am too needle-phobic to go for the Acupuncture, but she has an alternative non-needle technique which I've been offered and may take up. Hypnotherapy is excellent for helping me relax and chill and it makes everything seem much more manageable after a session. There is a lot of research that shows that hypnotherapy can boost the immune system by auto-suggestion, and it certainly really helps to keep me feeling very positive and upbeat, and a cheerful approach to all we are going through makes everything much easier to deal with. If anyone has any specific questions about either hypnotherapy or acupuncture, I can ask them and get back to you, either on this thread or via a private message, whatever you feel more comfortable about. Because of my diagnosis, they are both very knowledgeable about breast cancer and how their therapies might be able to help. All the best, and love and hugs to all Yvonne xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, sorry I've been away from the site for over a week - after being very ill on second chemo for a fortnight I've had a brilliant week and packed so much living into it it's been absolutely brilliant! I've had a really exciting invitation - to appear on the Alan Titchmarsh TV show on Wednesday! But it's only two days after my next chemo, so I'm not sure I'm going to be well enough to travel, and to take part. They are leaving it open, I can decide early Wed am. Has anyone got any tips that might help me be well enough in time! This will be my 3rd FEC, and the first time I sailed through it, the second time I was knocked flat for a fortnight. The show isn't about cancer, it's about being happy, and because I'm a Laughter Yoga Leader, a small group of us have been invited to demonstrate, although if I'm there I think they may focus a little on the benefits of laughter yoga on cancer. Also, as part of my brilliant week a good friend came over and took loads of photos of me bald, in wigs, and in  each of my eccentric hats! I've devoted a page on my blog to it and it's made a load of people laugh. If you want cheering up about hair loss taking a look might help, but because my blog uses my full name I can't really put the link on here, so if you want to take a look, please PM me on this site and I can let you know how to find it. Hope everyone else is blessed with a really happy week like mine one day very soon! Yvonne xxx  ",

Saxxy, I haven't been sick at all on FEC, but this time round I just felt like I'd been hit by a train and a bus and an articulated lorry at the exact same moment! Do you know how to postpone that feeling of just general horribleness at all? Mind you, now I've said that I've probably tempted fate and no doubt this one will have me chucking up for days! Ladybird, what an idea - I can only ask, but the thing is, I'm due there 9.15 on Monday so it may be too late to postpone, but I'll see what they say. I'll let you know what happens!

      "Content": "Hi Elder, I haven't had this, but I was with my Dad when just before a fairly major operation a few months ago, the anaethestist dropped the bombshell that they would use this type of anaethetic. He was fairly shaken by the news and so was I, but minutes later he got whisked off the theatre and there wasn't really time to process this new piece of information. It turned out to be fabulous for him. He was wheeled straight back to the ward, fully alert and awake and sitting bolt upright cracking jokes with everyone on the way. Within half an hour he was eating a full dinner, and as cheerful as anything, and allowed home the following morning. So no post op recovery or sickness or anaesthetic-induced depression, the only downside was that he wasn't allowed out of bed until the following morning, but he didn't go to theatre until about 4 in the afternoon. He also had significantly less pain than he had been expecting. Months later, he still says that he would opt for this again if he was given the choice. Another friend's mother had a hip replacement using the same technique, she too says that it was really good, and she loved the way that she knew no one could talk about her fat bum or whatever while she was in theatre! Hope it works as well for you, good luck and don't worry too much. Take care, love Yvonne xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynzilou, Lovely to see you back on here, but sorry your daughter is having a rough time with her mouth. There are lots of things that can help, I was prescribed two different mouthwashes, and I found the one called Cordosol (or something very similar - I can't find the bottle to check the spelling) was excellent. It sort of coated my mouth for twenty minutes or so so I was sometimes able to eat immediately afterwards. I also developed very severe oral thrush on each cycle, if her tongue is very white, that's probably also the case with her. If this is the case you will need to get a prescription for Nystatin very quickly, and it takes several days to go completely. There is also pineapple and pineapple juice, which amazingly really helps. I had read advice about this lots on this site, but my mouth was so painful I thought it would make it sting as well, so I didn't try it for ages. When I finally did, I couldn't believe how good it tasted and how much it seemed to relieve symptoms. There must be some sort of enzyme in it or something that counters some of this side effect. The worst thing for me was not being able to drink a cup of tea for about 10 days each cycle - it really tasted awful and made me feel sick the whole time. Hope this helps, and all the very best to both of you. Yvonne xx",

      "Content": "Hi, Yesterday I had my appointment with the NHS wig stylist, and it was something I had really been looking forward to all week. A very close friend (who always has amazing hair!) came to, and we approached it like two giggling schoolkids, really excited and positive. I have always had horrid hair, it's really fine, dark mouse in colour, dead straight and sticks to my head whatever I've tried to do to it. I've never had a good hair day in my life! So I've been really looking forward to this, and hoping to get fabulous hair for the first time in my life. The appointment went well, and I've been given a wig to try out over the weekend on family and friends. It's a lot lighter in colour than mine, much thicker, and very stylish. I don't look a bit like me, but it does look pretty good. Everyone who's seen it has been really positive, I even put a photo of me in on on Facebook last night asking for people to be perfectly honest about it, and everyone has just sort of gone \"Wow, amazing!\" and the love,support and kindness I've had from their comments is humbling. Even my teenage kids have been lovely about it, whereas I expected them to fall about laughing and take the mickey. I thought long and hard about the Facebook angle, but I felt it would make me far less self-conscious in the long-run if everyone could see it first and know what to expect. I haven't lost my hair yet, but had my first FEC on Monday so expect it to start falling out next weekend. What I can't understand is that everything should feel so great, it all went well, I look better in it than I've ever looked, and yet I feel really upset and emotional, and keep bursting into tears over everything. I just can't figure it out, why am I so upset about something that should be hugely positive?  I'd be interested to know if anyone else has had these sort of feelings, and if you've got any idea why I'm feeling so pants about it all. Many thanks, love Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hello Highland Mum, I had my second FEC this afternoon, and absolutely no nausea whatsoever on either cycles yet. I do hope these aren't famous last words! I took a tip from this site some weeks ago to fast from the night before completely, and drink as much water as you possibly can the day before, the day itself and the day after. Then my surgical oncologist told me off because the amount of water I was drinking (about 3 - 4 litres a day!) can dilute your salt and potassiam levels. So he suggested doing the same, but drinking lucozade or powerade as a third of your fluid intake.However, he then wrote to the chemo oncologist saying he'd seen me in clinic 3 days after clinic doing incredibly well, so well in fact that he was concerned that they had \"underdosed\" me! Checked today, they definitely haven't, and since my hair is falling out thick and fast, it's obvious that the chemo has had some effect. It is working so well for me, that I'd recommend not eating at all on the day of chemo, and loads of fluids. Good luck! Yvonne xx    ",

In the end, the oncologist just laughed and said that I had had the correct dose, (FEC 100), and very nicely and professionally inferred something along the lines of they are the chemo experts not the surgeons! Stress the tiredness and the baldness, and you should be fine!

Ask your Onc before you decide not to take them, just in case.  I'm wondering about Rads too - it the chemo is supposed to have blasted everything, and you, like me, is positively everything (!) what is left for the Rads to attack? I'm not even thinking too much about it yet, for me it will be well after Christmas, and I'll hopefully have had ample time to ask questions. My Onc inputted my details into a software programme, after a lot of determined but gentle persuasion from me, which was able to tell me that my survival rate would increase by 35% by having chemo. Hopefully we'll both be able to get our Oncs to do the same about RADS nearer the time. Baldness - I'm beginning to love it! Straight after chemo yesterday I frogmarched my poor, ever-loving, totally patient, completely supportive OH into TK Maxx, and I must have tried on about 50 outrageous hats in the mirror. We had a really funny time. The last time I wore a hat about 30 years ago, and I'm under five foot with a weight problem, so I always thing they just make me look shorter and fatter - not any more! I bought 6 loud and crazy hats and a very bightly multicoloured scarf too. I was in Sainsbury's at 8am in one of them, and no one stared or batted an eyelid, then I met a male friend of my daughter's who I haven't seen since diagnosis, and he just gave me a huge hug and told me I looked gorgeous in it! So now half of Sainsbury's probably think I have a 20 year old toyboy, but it was incredibly good for my ego and hat-wearing confidence! Chemo for me is in the afternoon too - I have to be at the hospital at 9am for all the prep stuff, but we get sent home for a couple of hours and they ring us when it's ready. Last time I got it at nearly 4pm and yesterday it was earlier - just after 2pm. And I felt well and buzzing til bed around midnight! Yvonne xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sammy, I've just read your post and my heart goes out to you, I'm so sorry about your sister's news, it's exactly what we all dread. I sometimes think it's harder for friends and family to cope with this than it is ourselves. We have something to do, we are taking treatments or surgery or whatever, whereas those who love us can feel so helpless and lost in these situations. I know it's all a shock and you're in bits at the moment, but it isn't all necessarily bad news yet. The Marsden haven't given up on your sister yet, and when you're past the shock of the next few days, you won't either. Cancer treatments are developing almost on a daily basis, and news that would have been a definite death sentence 20 years ago simply isn't anymore. When I was last in hospital, there were four of us in a bay, all with cancer, at the very same hospital your sister is under. 3 of us looked like death warmed up, but there was one lady, in her early sixties, who looked absolutely the picture of health. It turned out she's had cancer for 16 years, and 15 years ago she was told that it had spread to several other organs. It's incurable, but treatable, and she is living a full and happy life, with her cancer being closely monitored and managed. She had an eight year old child when she was first diagnosed, who is now in her mid twenties! Treatments have come a long way since she was first diagnosed, so your sister is in the right place to benefit from them. I totally understand that you don't want to cry in front of your sister, but it's important that she knows you care, and that this is affecting you too. She is probably feeling frightened and frantically worried and in despair right now. Please try and be there for her, even if you can only manage a text or a Facebook message. Has your sister looked into all the complementary cancer advice there is out there too? There is so much research into what foods you can eat to help get better, and things you can do to help the healing process. I'm not suggesting that she do any of this INSTEAD of conventional treatments, but a lots of us feel far more in control and feel we are supporting our treatments by doing something positive. In my case I drink green tea several times a day (even though I absolutely hate it!), eat more fruit and veg than I ever thought possible, cycle manically on my new exercise bike every day (I was a fully paid up member of the couch potato brigade a few months ago!), and even mash huge quanitities of tumeric into mashed potato! I'm not saying that this is the direction your sister wants to go in, and it's not right for everyone, but for me it feels like I'm doing something positive to help this situation. There are no guarantees with cancer, but then there aren't any guarantees in life either. Shortly after I was diagnosed, a friend of mine was knocked over by a motorbike, and although she survived, recovery will be slow and her family life changed in a nanosecond. For me, that put my problems into perspective, and showed me how fragile our hold onto life is. My friend was incredibily lucky to survive, and it could have been a very different outcome. So, whether you have cancer or not, life if precious, and what makes it so precious is the relationships we have and the people we care about. None of us are going to be here forever, so, once the shock is over and you can face your sister, make sure you both have lots of dancing around the kitchen moments and hugs and laughs to look forward to, because it really is those lovely moments that make it all worthwhile. Sammy, you'll get through this. You also are not even one tiny bit selfish, completely on the contrary, your sister is really lucky to have you. Take care, lots of love and hugs, and please come back on this site and let us know how things are going. Yvonne xxxxxxxx                  ",

You are in shock, so is your whole family and your sister, and you need to do all this crying to help you to get your head around things. You won't always feel this low about it, things will seem a lot better as the days and weeks pass. \"Terminal\" doesn't necessary mean what it used to mean. There is so much hope and thousands of success stories out there. Go with the flow of your feelings, and there will come a time very soon when you are able to help your sister launch a \"beating this\" campaign. Right now though, you need to rant and rave and scream and shout and rail against the heavens about the unfairness of it all, and then you and she will both find the strength and resources to find real hope. Meanwhile, thinking of you, take very good care of yourself, and if you can, try and enjoy your holiday. Perhaps a week or so away from everything will help you gain a different perspective. We're all here to support you and help you through these awful dark days. They happen to all of us, both at first, and then later, when we least expect it. But they do pass, and you and your sister still have lots and lots of fun and love and laughter and dancing to do together. Lots of love Yvonne xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Annie, Don't you dare even think about dying soon - I for one would miss your posts far too much! Just think, if the Tax is making you feel this rotten, what must it be doing to those cheeky little cancer cells that have nowhere near as much strength and tenacity as you have! You're having such a really tough time of it, what with the FEC not having worked well and the fact that you haven't had surgery yet, plus the mets to get your head around - it really isn't fair at all. Maybe the tide is turning with the TAX - I really hope so. I'm on tax too - my second dose is due next Tuesday, and it knocked me sideways where I was virtually bedridden for 5 days and thought I was dying and really didn't care one way or the other. I'm lucky and have bounced back, and have more energy this week than about 6 months before diagnosis. I'm sorry it hasn't been the same for you, but then again, maybe it means that it's working better for you than it is for me, who knows? Anti-depressants sound like a very good idea. They take a few weeks to work but when they finally do kick in hopefully everything will just seem much more doable. Your experience with claustrophia during your bone scan really echoed my own experiences - not with claustrophia but with needle-phobia. Virtually every medic in the hospital has had to deal with me being a completely babyish rubbish totally embarrassingly nervous wreck. Eventually I wrote about it on my blog - the hardest article I've ever had to write. Now I've been invited to speak at a conference about it next year, lots of the team have read my piece, and I feel far more able to admit to this ridiculous crazy mad-woman fear of mine, and there is a lot more understanding when I blub.  Have you tried writing down your negative feelings - I know that someone else has suggested it. For me, keeping a blog has been enormously valuable, and often the saddest most depressing thoughts, once written down, find a vein of deep humour that just makes me laugh. It also means that all my friends and family are kept informed and updated, not just on the minutiae of treatments, but also about my state of mind - I can almost hear them thinking \"Oh good, it's not a walking-on-eggshells day, today\". Hang on in there. Chemo is temporary, even though it doesn't seem like it at the time. Lots of love and hugs Yvonne xxxxxx",

The scan may prove to be absolutely nothing to worry about, and until you know for sure, you both just have to wait, and try not to worry. With BC, virtually everyone agrees, it's all the waiting for answers or treatments or whatever that really is the hardest part of the deal - once you know what you're up against, or understand what your treatment entails, it all seems much easier. Even if it has spread to her liver, people can live for years upon years. At that stage it is \"incurable\", but nowadays that doesn't necessarily mean \"terminal\". Diabetes is \"incurable\", as are lots of other conditions, but it doesn't mean that your life expectancy is any shorter. Cancer treatments are advancing all the time, there are treatments available today that didn't exist even 5 years ago. So when you google, the statistics are already out of date. Women who have already survived 10 years post-diagnosis didn't have the access to many of the treatments BC women are being routinely offered now, so those of us being diagnosed and treated now are already in a far stronger position of having a much better survival rate. And the BC survival rates are already impressive compared to many other forms of cancer. Just carry on being there for your mum. You're obviously a good team, and you're lucky to have such a good, close relationship. Good luck to both of you. Yvonne x",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, There is stacks of things you can eat or avoid that may up your chances. I have done an awful lot of research into this, but I must be honest and say that I'm lousy at will-power and sticking to it all - particularly now I'm on chemo! Green tea, between 3 - 5 cups a day. Tumeric - half a spoon a day mixed with black pepper (essential because it makes the tumeric 1000x more effective), you can hide in it mashed potato or stews, or just drink it down in warm water. I've even sprinkled it on honey sandwiches. Half an asprin a day. As much fruit and veg as you can manage, and cut out as much sugar as you can. Avoid white bread or processed foods, particularly cured cheese and I have chosen not to eat soya products because there is a theory that they are linked with oestrogen production and I'm triple positive. Lemon juice is good, organic milk is good, in fact organic wherever you can. Garlic and ginger also have anti-cancer properties.  There is stacks of information out there, and some books I've found really helpful. I also did a 2 day course at the Penny Brohn centre in Bristol which focuses a lot of nutrition. A friend of mine from there has started something called the Gerson Approach, which is a very strict dietary approach which they claim can help your body to cure itself. I know I wouldn't have the willpower to get through the first day so it's not right for me, but might be for others. Be careful when researching because there are a lot of  \"quack cures\" that reckon diet alone can cure you. I'm totally putting my trust in the very best of modern western medicine, but doing what I can to augment that with dietary measures. I don't know if we're allowed to recommend books on this site, but if you want to PM me I can give you some titles I've found helpful. It's not only diet that can help, but also resting, visualising, meditation, exercise and all sorts of things. For me, doing a little bit extra makes me feel more in control and that I'm taking ownership of this problem and doing what I can. However, during chemo it has all gone to pot, and I'm craving all sorts of things I shouldn't go anywhere near...... but whatever it takes to get me through it and make it easier. Once chemo is finished I can get back on that wagon, but I'm not going to beat myself up in the meantime. Some people also avoid cleaning and cosmetic products with parabens. In a houseful of vain teenagers I know I'd be fighting a losing battle with that one! Penny Brohn put it into perspective for me - don't try and do everything because you'll set yourself up for failure. Just change one or two things every now and again and you'll succeed. Good luck, and let us know how you get on. Yvonne xx",

I'm very pleased to report that I had an absoutely excellent time at the hospital time - no spread to the left lymph nodes at all! Also the mastectomy is a success too - they found a tumour far bigger than they expected - originally it was sized at 2.2cms, when it was actually a massive 14.4cms - that's virtually six inches! They got a clear 1 cm margin in all directions, not quite as great as the 2cms they hoped for, but the fact that there are clear margins all the way around is a huge relief. It's also completely changed my attitude towards losing the breast today - the scar may be 10 inches long and livid right now, but it's also beautiful because it's totally cancer-free. Today for the first time I can see the end in sight after the chemo, radio, hormone therapy, second mastectomy and reconstruction - and I can begin to see that it might actually be a happy ending! There may well be all sorts of stumbles ahead, but tonight everything seems fabulous! x x",

      "Content": "Tomorrow, I have my follow up appointment after my mastectomy last week, and also to get the results of the lymph node sampling. My surgeon was very understanding about my reticence to have sentinel nodes taken from my left side because I had the full clearance on the right hand side when I had the first batch of surgery (lumpectomies both sides, but one had no clear margin, hence the mx, and the other turned out to be invasive when they had believed it to be in situ, hence no nodes taken then). Of all the surgery I have so far had, I have had more problems, discomfort, annoyance from the auxillary node clearance than anything else. It turned out that 9 of the 24 nodes were cancerous. Instead of doing a sentinel node clearance on the left side, he took only two, and has sent them away for a thorough lab report. I am dreading hearing tomorrow that the cancer has spread to the the left hand side and what that might mean in terms of treatment. I really don't want to lose them all on both sides. Are there any half-way measures that anyone knows of? I keep thinking that 16 of the original node clearance were cancer free and I didn't need to lose them, but I don't know if they can just take out a few at a time to check them and stop when they reach the first node where the cancer hasn't spread. Luckily both my body and bone scans came back clear, although with one or two little question marks that aren't conclusive yet. Is there anyone else who has lost all the lymph nodes on both sides, and if so, how are you coping? Have I been really unlucky with my right arm - I've had awful over-sensitive sensations, heaviness, recurrent infections and lack of co-ordination, it's been really debilitating. Also, are they likely to be any other shocks - are they any sinister findings that can happen following a mastectomy? I've only been on this site for 2 days, and would really appreciate any thoughts.

      "Content": "Hi Cathy, I've tried this fasting too. I read some very convincing researc h that they had done with mice, splitting them into two groups, one fasting, one not, prior to chemo, and the fasting group had significantly lower levels of side effects. I did it on both my first two FECs, and had absolutely no sickness whatsoever. I virtually sailed through the first one, but was very ill during the second one, which co-incided with a collapsed lung being diagnosed, so although at the time I blamed chemo, it was probably unrelated. The third time, 10 days ago, I didn't bother, and I have never been so sick in my life! So I'm definitely going to fast again for the last  3 chemos, all Tax. I didn't follow the guidelines to the letter, but fasted from 6pm the previous evening, with a very light (2 slices of toast) supper on the chemo evening, then eating fairly normally from about midday on the day after. However, I drank masses of water on those three days, 3 litres or so, but my oncologist told me that I had to have some electrolyles, so recommended at least 2 bottles of something like lucozade sport or powerade during each of those three days. Whether it really works or was just a placebo, I really don't know, but I would now recommend it totally, and it certainly made things a lot easier for me.

      "Content": "Hi I'm new too, and had a right side mastectomy 8 days ago, following earlier surgery in June when the lumpectomy didn't have clear margins. I lost all the lymph nodes in June too, and also had another lumpectomy on the left because I have oh so cleverly managed to develop two completely unrelated, completely different types of tumour, one on each side. This mastectomy surgery is honestly a walk in the park compared to what I went through 6 weeks ago! I wasn't offered an immediate reconstruction, and if I had been I had already decided that that wasn't what I wanted. For me, I felt that losing a breast would be a sad day, and I want to look forward to a very happy day at some point in the distant future, after chemo and radiotherapy is finished plus any other delights they decide I should sample, when getting new breasts will be a really positive thing, and will signify that the treatment has finished. Everyone is different, and you must do what you feel is right for you. It took 2 or 3 days before I felt emotionally strong enough to really take on board that I'm now flat on that side, and I've blubbed for a few seconds maybe 3 or 4 times over it, but it's fine, and I'm now having quite a lot of fun trying to work out how the little \"comfy\" should be worn, and how to keep it in place. Yes, there is some pain, but it is very manageable, particularly with painkillers, but even without, and yes, there are moments of of feelings of intense vulnerability, but everyday I'm feeling stronger and better, and I'm actually really happy that they have now cut away the bits of me that have spent the last few months trying to kill me. It really isn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it was going to be, and I really hope you have an easy time of it too. Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hi Annabel, Firstly, just want to send you every bit of love and hugs that I can muster - your post is so incredibly moving, and I wish there was some instant cure for these overwhelming feelings of despair when they come. Like some of the others here, up until 3 or 4 weeks ago, in the 5 months since diagnosis I had been relentlessly cheerful and upbeat and positive, to the point where I thought I'd actually \"got away with it\" in terms of the awful despair. Then 3 weeks ago, the world caved in, and for the next fortnight I couldn't see any hope or light at the end of the tunnel, and I too, toyed with the idea that I just didn't want any more of this and would rather die. Luckily for me, it lifted after a fortnight, and I've just spent the best week I've had so far, feeling great both physically and emotionally, and having a stack load of really lovely moments. You too will come out the other side, and feel much better far sooner than you think might even be possible right now. I had also had a really awful pain in my chest that started 2 weeks after my mx, and had just got progressively worse. Despite mentioning it umpteen times, I was fobbed off with the fact that it was probably wound site recovery, when I knew it was lung. I spent 4 weeks convincing myself that it was the cancer spreading, which also really fed into my state of mind. Then, 10 days ago, they finally diagnosed the cause - a small part of my lung had collapsed - painful, but totally curable and certainly not cancer. I wanted to dance around the kitchen because I had a collapsed lung - crazy to anyone else, but I think you'll understand! It's really tough that you have secondaries to have to deal with, and it's everyone's biggest fear that scans will be bad news, but it certainly needn't be a death sentence. I met a lady at my unit who has lived with secondaries for over 15 years, and they have been managed and kept under control, and she honestly looked younger and fitter than I do, even though she is more than 10 years older. You are being diagnosed 15 years later than she was, when treatments are better and they understand much more. Our job is to stay alive, every day we do that we are closer to them making even more treatment breakthroughs. Is there anything you can do to spoil yourself and give yourself a treat? I'm all for cancer curing diets and green tea and tumeric and everything else, but I also know that sometimes it's only things like chocolate, cake, and very nice red wine that can truly feed my soul! Please look after yourself, but I agree with Sasha, if you feel miserable and want to shout and scream and cry and weep and wail or whatever, just go with the flow because it's always far better out than in. Lots and lots of love, Yvonne xxxxxxx",

There was a post on here in the last few days about aunthenticity of feelings - sometimes the negative feelings just have to come out, and we can't beat ourselves up for not being postive 24/7. You are also dealing with the shock of suddenly losing your brother - even without breast cancer to deal with, that alone would be enough to make you very low indeed. We women are trained to just keep going, put up and shut up, and make everyone else's life as easy as possible, and it's very hard to admit that we are struggling, you are absolutely right. Things will get better, and it won't always seem so bleak and hard. I hope it happens for you sooner than you think. Meanwhile, lots of love and hugs, and just take it easy and look after yourself, and if you want to scream and shout, rant and rave and cry, go ahead, and you will feel better for it.

I did my blog at Google Blogger, and it's public, so anyone can read it, but I had the option of doing a prviate one just for friends, it's just a case of setting the privacy settings. Then once you post, it allows you to put a link straight onto your Facebook account if you have one, so your friends can access it easily, or you give your friends a password to let them view it if you're not on Facebook. I've found it invaluable - it means that I don't get loads of phonecalls or texts expecting updates all the time, and I don't have to repeat everything all the time, which can be exhausting. My friends love it too! I decided to go public after a lot of thought, and I quite like knowing that people are reading it on virtually every continent, although it is still quite small-scale, and about a quarter of the readership is people I actually know and like! Good luck, I would recommend it! Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hi Elder, I'm in almost exactly the same place as you, just a few weeks further down the line. I've got cancer on both sides, and they misjudged the seriousness of both of them, so opted for breast conservation surgery which I had 6 weeks ago. At the same time they discovered a lymph node spread so I had them all out on the right side, and last week I had to have more surgery, this time a right side mastectomy and more nodes taken for sampling on the left. I've also had recurrent infections and emergency hospital admissions because of them in between times. Originally they thought the cancers were Grade 0 and 1, they now know I am a Grade 3, one side lobular the other ductal, both invasive, and I am triple positve on both, which I'll thrilled about because they have more pharaceutical weaponry to throw at them. There has been some really lovely encouragement already posted by people, which has helped me too. I am coping by staying in the present - dealing with life sometimes in 10 minute chunks stops me worrying about things that might never happen. I'm also taking great comfort in knowing that survival rates are based on people who were at our stage some years ago, when the treatment was nowhere near as advanced as it is now. I'm also looking at all the fabulous advantages of having breast cancer - everybody is so lovely, the cleaning can wait, I have a perfect excuse if I'm invited to something I really don't want to go to..... the list goes on and on! I'm also trying to find the funny side of things, which is really helpful, and I'm using the whole thing as a chance to stop, slow down, smell  the coffee and reevaluate what's important to me. Then the whole lot goes in my blog, which is keeping all my friends informed so I don't have to repeat everything all the time, and it's also keeping them laughing, which is good. It's also cathartic and theraputic for me, but when I dump all the wretched stuff there it helps me see a different perspective, and that helps too. Just keep on going, take it a day, or even 10 minutes, at a time, there is still loads of good news there, and cry, wail and scream when you really need to, whereever you are. My other half would love to cry in Ikea, just because he hates the place and he doesn't even have cancer! I'm mostly fine emotionally now, but for the 4 days in hospital  last week I sobbed my heart out all the time because I'm hopelessly and pathetically needle-phobic and I had a canula in my hand, so I think chemo is going to be a barrel of laughs - not. Good luck, please let us know how you get on. Take care, Yvonne    ",

This evening, out of the blue, I've suddenly noticed that that arm is significantly bigger than the other one. No pain or discomfort, but about 20% more swollen. I know from reading previous posts that some of you have been taught massage to reduce this type of swelling, but I haven't been given any advice along those lines. I'm concerned that it might be the start of lymphodema which I really don't want to develop - any suggestions as to what I can do to reduce the swelling or prevent it getting worse?

I had a similar thing, with awful chest pain whenever I breathed and they kept teling me it was wound pain, and I knew darn well it wasn't. I had totally convinced myself that is was mets, either in the ribs or lung, when it worsened a couple of weeks and I got rushed to hospital with what they thought was a Pulmonary Embolism. Luckily they were able to rule that out, but I was finally diagnosed - with a partially collapsed lung. The relief just flooded through me, I'm probably the only person ever to be singing dancing and laughing around the kitchen because I have a collapsed lung, but that was so much better a diagnosis than the mets I thought it was! Mention it, it's almost certainly nothing serious, but you need more reassurances than you're getting. Yvonne xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Chloecat45, This is tough, and having breast cancer isn't just about the actual medical or conventional treatment to try and cure it, it's also about dealing with the emotional side too - the turmoil we all go through of shock, horror, denial, anger, fear - the list is endless, and the depths this diagnosis can take you to are really frightening. I know and understand where you are coming from. It sound like you are feeling badgered by everyone around you - the medics and friends and family - to accept the conventional medical treatment. They all have only your best interests at heart, but they can't make that decision for you, and the more pressure you are under, the less room there is in your head to make the decision that is right for you, so that you are in control of your treatment. Control is a very central issue in this whole cancer thing for me. I want to know everything, I want to call at least some of the shots, and I needed time to get my head around it all and make a decision on treatment that I could live with, because whatever anybody else says, I was the only one who would have to cope with any of the horrors of treatment first hand. For a brief time I was so frightened of all the treatments that I was seriously considering refusing any of it. I am severely needle phobic, and that has made every step of my treatment incredibly traumatic, and i knew that it would be a severe ordeal. I hope you come to the same decision I did, to go down the conventional route. There may be some success stories with the alternative treatments, but they are outweighed time and again but the conventional route - with a well over 90% success rate. It's a huge gamble to take the less followed routes, and I wasn't prepared in the end to take any unnecessary risks. I also do a lot of other stuff, diet, visualising, resting, exercising, etc etc and have made quite significant life style changes I've researched which will up my success odds in beating this, and this also helps me feel I have some control in this thing. One day, wouldn't it be nice if there was a single pill you could take to get rid of breast cancer, but until then, we haven't many choices, and if we want to live, unfortunately there is only one choice to make. It's a hard, tough difficult choice all the same, but unless you can commit to that choice because it's the one that you sincerely know is right for you, not because other people tell you to, you could feel very out of control. If you go down the conventional route, it's still your body, and you can opt out any time. But if you take too long to reach a decision, it may be too late to opt in. Good luck with whatever you decide, either way isn't an easy ride, but please keep in touch and keep us posted - we're all in this together Yvonne xxx",

I think for a lot of us, when we're first diagnosed, we are horror-struck at the idea of submitting ourselves through the conventional treatments with all their side effects, and I did spend a week or so researching into possible alternatives, but nothing was convincing. I have just finished reading Gloria Hunniford's book about her daughter, Caron Keating, who walked away from conventional treatment and went chasing all sorts of so-called alternative cures instead, and I just found it incredibly sad, and it also made me quite angry that there were so many charlatans virtually queuing up to make money out of a very vulnerable woman .I would recommend that anyone thinking of alternative treatment should read this first to see just how careful you really should be in protecting yourself and your bank balance. Chloecat, I don't know where you get the idea that the NHS provides cheaper treatment. Cancer treatment is phenomenally expensive, and I wake up every morning so grateful to live in a country where I can get the very best of cutting-edge medical treatment without having to worry about the cost of it.

      "Content": "Hi Annie, Like you, I had crippling migranes all through my teens and early twenties, then one every now and again since then, sometimes going several years without one. I haven't had any on FEC (has my 2nd FEC yesterday, and I'm beginning to feel a bit of a fraud because I'm having a pretty easy time of it!) however, since diagnosis in May I've had 4 migranes. I wonder if it's stress-related, and lets face it, if that was the case, then with our condition we ought to be having them all the time! However, it might be an idea to call your BC Nurse to ask if it's a normal side effect, just to put your mind at rest. If it's any consolation, I've been really worried about a very severe chest pain I developed two days after my first FEC, which is still very painful, and making me breathless. Like you, I was frightened that it was a sign of the cancer spreading. Then I had a real scare on Friday when my GP sent me to hospital because it showed all the signs of being a Pulmonary Embolism - how lucky is that, not just one, but two life threatening conditions to contend with! It wasn't, but they put me through my paces, CT scan, blood tests, X-rays, the works. To cut a long story short, over the past 3 weeks I have explained by fears to several doctors, BC nurses and oncologists, all of whom have told me that it would be \"highly unusual\" for metastatis symptoms to develop so quickly and so severely, especially whilst on chemo. They still don't know what's causing the pain, but they are having the CT scan looked at by a team tomorrow, and they think that it may be pleurisy, which is nasty, but curable. Good luck with everything, and I hope the migranes cease really quickly. Love Yvonne xx .",

I am about 3 months ahead of you, with an MX done late July and now half way through chemo. I don't think we will ever be given an \"all clear\", and personally if any doctor told me I was all clear, I would those words with a healthy pinch of cynical salt. I know that, for the rest of my life (which I'm hoping will run into decades!) I will be hyper-aware and vigilant of any small sign that may signal the cancer's return. However, nowadays the treatments are so much more effective, and new research and development in oncology in happening at an impressive speed, that living with the threat of cancer no longer carries the doom and gloom it used to. Breast cancer rates are really impressive, and continuing to improve, and there is also so much we can do for ourselves to optimise our outcomes in terms of diet, attitude and lifestyles. Try and stay strong, and stay upbeat and positive at least some of the time. It's all happened in a whirl for you - diagnosis and surgery all within a very short period of time. In some ways you are very lucky to have an obviously on-the-ball medical team, but in terms of getting your head around things, you are probably still reeling in shock.

      "Content": "Hi Coot, I had my mastectomy on 30/7, following on from two lumpectomies - I had two primary cancers, both invasive, one lobular and one ductal, on each side. They weren't able to get clear margins from the right side lumpectomy, and they also found cancer spread in 9 of the 25 removed lymph nodes, so a mastectomy was the only option. In the end, the tumour there was 14.4cm (nearly 6 flipping inches!) and it also had a massive infection in it when they operated (I'd been in hospital for days on I/v anitbiotics beforehand which weren't really doing much to improve it). So my mastectomy was a big one, with a 12 inch scar going all the way under my arm to my back, and a lot of chest wall muscle had to be removed too. I came home 2 days later, still with drains in. Sleeping with them was a pain, but it was worth it because they removed a lot of fluid which otherwise would have built up and caused a lot of pain. They stayed in for 6 days. Stitches stayed in for 2 weeks, when my surgeon removed every second one in clinic (because of the infection, he had had to use old-fashioned stitches), and then a week after that I had further surgey to fit a portacath, and he removed the rest then. All the way through, the pain has been incredibly manageable, and I only took a couple of paracetomol once in the first few days home. However, looking at the scar has been a different story - I really didn't expect it to affect me so badly, but it took about 3 or 4 weeks before I could look without bursting into tears every time. I've now been really strict with myself, and I make myself look at it at least twice a day, and I'm beginning to cope much better. As far as bras are concerned, I found them far to painful to even contemplate wearing for the first few weeks. I still haven't had my bra fitting or my proper prosthesis fitting yet. Instead, the hospital will give you a \"comfy\" (ask for two if you can!) which is a soft squishy breast shaped cushion like a cuddly toy. I started by pinning them to the inside of my tops which worked very well, but then I discovered that M & S have a surgical underwear department, and they sell these lovely vest tops with pockets to put the \"comfy\" straight into. They are only £9.50 each before they are zero VAT, and I ordered mine online and they arrived 48 hours later. Good luck with your op, just try and go with the flow and let it happen, and I think you'll be very surprised at how well you cope with everything. The anticipation and worry is honestly far worse than the operation itself. Thinking of you, love and hugs, Yvonne        ",

It's great that she has you to support her, but you have to look after yourself too - our friends and family suffer really badly through all of this too. As far as pyjamas for hospital are concerned, button through ones are best because it sometimes seems like the world and his brother want to examine you before and after the op, and button through pyjama tops help to present your modesty at a time you feel at your most vulnerable. However, pockets in the pyjama top won't work for the drains, for a couple of reasons. The drain bottles can get very heavy and would tip out of a pocket, and to enable them to drain properly and effectively they need to be kept as low as possible, certainly well below waist level. At my hospital, they have volunteers making really pretty little bags with handles to carry them, the bags are fabric, and about 9 inches tall by 6 inches wide, with two handles long enough to go over your wrist. See if you can find anything suitable, but if all else fails, a plastic supermarket shopping bag would do the trick nicely. I got my pyjamas in M & S and I bought a pair two sizes too big, because movement in your arm is restricted for a few weeks, and being baggy they were much easier to get on and off. Very best wishes for Tuesday, she will get through this, and good luck for everything. Yvonne xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lyn, It's good to see you online again - I've been thinking about you and your daughter all morning! This is torture for you, the waiting and helplessness, you can do nothing but trust that she is in very good hands, and console yourself that right now, your daughter is blissfully unaware of anything whatsoever, deeply and peacefully asleep, with several highly skilled people keeping a very watchful eye on her wellbeing and safety. Don't go worrying about chemo yet - they usually wait for at least a month for you to get your strength back after a mastectomy, and you will have several opportunities to talk to her team about all the ins and outs of it beforehand. You've got enough on your hands just helping her get her strength, and her sense of humour, back as quickly as you can in the next couple of weeks. I'm on chemo two now, and virtually symptom free apart from the hair, so it's not necessarily always awful. I wasn't lucky enough to get a morphine pump, they had given me a heavy-duty morphine shot in theatre that lasted more than 24 hours, I think I'd have really enjoyed having one though! Just make sure that she has pain relief ready and available, as soon as you can ask a nurse what painkillers are written up on her chart - sometimes doctors forget to write the stronger ones up, and then if you're in pain and there's no doctor around it can take ages to sort it out. Tramodol or Codeine are fairly standard ones more heavy duty ones, and I additionally was written up for Diclofenac, but if she has a morphine pump she might not need extra stuff. You need your strength now, so hope you're able to eat a proper lunch and drink loads of fluid and get some rest. My OH has carried me through this whole thing, and I don't think our carers can ever understand the level of our gratitude for their love, help and support. I don't know how people get through this alone, and your daughter is very lucky to have you. My OH has had a few teary moments, but finds it difficult to tell me how he feels because he doesn't want to give me any more worry - but my friends fill me in when he has a little offload to them! So then I tell him off and make him talk to me about it too. I lost my mum when I was a teenager, but it took a very long time until I met my OH 4 years ago to have someone I can completely totally trust again. As mum's go, you seem like one of the very best, and I do hope your daughter appreciates all that you are doing for her! Lots of love, take care, pace yourself, and roll on this evening's visiting time! Yvonne xx",

It's all much easier from now on - you've climbed that awful mountain of waiting, now you know what your facing, and it's all downhill from now. It won't necessarily all be plain sailing and you're likely to hit the odd rough moment or two, we all do,  but with all that tangible motherly love oozing from every word you write, you will cope with whatever happens brilliantly. I think we all want to adopt you as our mum! ! ! Yvonne xxx",

It's just that I spend so much time there recently it's becoming more familiar than my own front room! I've got breast cancer too, and managed to get two tumours, one in each breast, totally different types and completely unrelated. I had a lumpectomy on both sides in June, but they didn't get all of one of them, so I had to have a mastectomy on the right side on 30th July. They also removed 4 lymph nodes from one side which were fortunately clear, but on the other side they removed all of them and found cancer in 9 nodes. Despite all this, I feel i've come through it all relatively unscathed. It's not nice, it's not the way I wanted to spend my summer, but it is all doable, particularly if you have a supportive network of friends and family sharing the burden. 8 weeks later, I've got full movement and no wound pain whatsoever, even though it feels like I got about every complication going! I'm now on chemo, and losing my hair, but it really doesn't matter if it makes me well again! Good luck for your daughter, both of you stay strong, love Yvonne",

      "Content": "Lilybeth, What a lovely idea! I'll remember that next year when my second mx is due!   Lyn, Just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking of you and your daughter this evening, and hope it goes really well in the morning. Tonight and first thing tomorrow are the worst parts of this, all that fear and worry and apprehension. By the time surgery happens, then there is a real focus on getting better as quickly as possible which is much more positive, plus you then know what you'll be dealing with, which is probably nowhere near as bad as you think it will be when all you have is your imagination running riot! Every hospital seems to do things slightly differently. I didn't have a recon, but I had been quite seriously ill beforehand and had been in hosptial on iv antibiotics for days trying to cure an infection before surgery. I had also had two lumpectomies and a full auxilliary node clearance. They did the mx and on the other side, took 4 nodes at the same time. I didn't have a catheter, and I was sent home with drains, which they wanted to stay in for about 10 days. (The previous drains had come out too early, loads of fluid had built up, and that's what had caused the infections so they didn't want to take any chances. I came home three days later, still with drains, but then I had an accident with the drain and managed to get knotted up in it whilst asleep and tore the tube in half! Scary as hell as the time, but later hilariously funny in the retelling!  The infection plus the full node clearance meant that my arm was hopefess for weeks, and that was the absolute worst part of the whole thing for me, with really odd unpleasant sensations in it. Drains at home are a pain, but it's a small price to pay to be home! From personal experience, I'd suggest trying to keep them in for as long as possible. Thinking of you all tomorrow, please keep us updated, and love and hugs to both of you Yvonne xxxxx PS one of the things that keeps me sane is writing a blog about it all, starting the day before I went into hospital for my first op. I also find reading other breast cancer blogs really helpful to compare experiences, and some of them are laugh-out-loud funny too. My blog is public, and it's really exciting when complete strangers from about 42 countires read it. Is this something your daughter might want to do, or to read others' experiences? Let me know and I can point you in the direction of some really lovely uplifting blogs xxx",

You have done the sensible thing, and seen your GP. It may well be nothing serious, but everyone here knows that it's the waiting for tests and results that is the worst part of all of this. Just try to take the next few days an hour at a time, and for goodness sake, please do not be tempted to google! Lots of the info is either out of date or plainly wrong, and I don't think there is anyone here who hasn't frightened themselves witless at one point or another! Can you organise some treats or outings with good friends to take your mind off things? Try and keep busy if you can. Hopefully you will have your mammogram, get really lovely news to say it's all negative, and then you'll have a really lovely reason to celebrate. If it does turn out to be what you're hoping it isn't, breast cancer now has a really encouraging survival rate, well into the ninety percents, and there are some really good treatments they can give you. Whatever happens, take it one day at a time, keep in touch with all the lovely ladies on this site, and stay as cheerful and upbeat and positive as you can as often as you can. Meanwhile, lots of love and hugs, Yvonne xxxx      ",

      "Content": "Hi Purple Heart, I'll echo what Helen has written too. Your partner is very lucky to have someone by her side, and please know that those of us who have supportive partners through these times are really blessed. Whatever her reasons for not going ahead with Chemo, she has obviously researched into it, and weighed up things and made the decision that is right for her now. It sounds like her family are understandably incredibly worried about her, and want her to opt for the safety net of chemo, and are trying to persuade you to take a similar stance. Your role now, as I see it, is to protect her as much as you can from the negative impact of family members trying to tell you what you should be doing, and try as hard as you can to advocate her stance to her family in a way they will \"get\". It's not easy. My wider family are fabulous, but since I've had cancer if I had a penny for every time any of them say to me \"what you should be doing is.....\" I'd be a very rich woman!  My 80 year old dad has taken to sometimes even ringing me up past midnight and telling me off for not being in bed yet .... something he really hasn't had the right to do since I was a teenager!! Yes, it gets very irritating, but I do try to find the funny side of it too.  I looked at a lot of alternative therapies and some of them seem to have very strong evidence of very good outcomes, but personally I'm not brave enough to put my trust in them completely, and I admire your partner for her courage. The bottom line is, this is her cancer, no one elses, and she needs to feel in control. She needs to take ownership of how to recover, and unless she is totally behind any particular treatment, be it mainstream or alternative, she won't feel like she's in the driving seat, and she won't be able to drive herself out of trouble as effectively. Bullying someone into accepting treatment they don't want is not the way forward, no matter how strongly the people who care about her feel - she has to do this for herself, not for them. She is also saying no to chemo now, but maybe she may change her mind at a later stage. She is less likely to ever change her mind if her family are putting her under too much pressure and making too much of an issue about it.  Can you be the peacemaker, and help her family offer their love and support in ways that may be more helpful to her right now? Whatever pressure they put her under, you don't have to join in, and right now she really needs a ally. Good luck, and I think you are doing a fabulous job! Yvonne x x      ",

      "Content": "Thank you Babs. My lovely surgeon rang me at home last night to let me know about that the chest X-ray results were fine, which was a relief, and today the pain, though still there, is much more manageable. My surgeon thinks he knows what's causing it! I've read so much about all the things you can do to increase your own survival odds, and as well as completely changing the way I eat, I've also bought an exercise bike, because regular exercise is supposed to be really good too. If you knew me, I would win all the gold medals for taking couch-potatoism to an artform, so the exercise bike has caused a lot of teasing and leg-pulling among friends and family, which has made me determined to keep going on it. Anyway, my surgeon thinks I've overdone it! My tumour was so large (14.4cm - nearly 6 inches!) that they had to remove a lot of chest wall muscle too, and me pedalling away too much so soon after surgery has almost certainly caused these pains which got so bad I really thought I was about to peg it! So I'm back to my old ways of couch-potatoness for the next few days, strictly on medical advice, of course! Thank you for your concern Love Yvonne xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'd be really grateful if anyone could let me know if they have had this type of problem, and what I might be facing to rectify it later today at a post-op hospital appt. I've developed a very large, flat lump, about the size of the palm of my hand, directly below my mastectomy scar. I had the mx surgery on 30/7. It seems to have developed very quickly, since yesterday, and it hurts the whole time, particularly every time I breathe in or out. At first I thought it might be some wierd complication to do with the FEC I started on Monday (which I haven't had even one tiny little symptom of so far, so much thank everyone who suggested to drink and drink and drink - I think it worked!), so I rang the hospital yesterday, and they had me packing a  bag all ready to come in, but then they decided that it isn't chemo or infection related, and since I have a scheduled appt with the surgeon today, it could wait. Might it be a seroma? Can they develop this quickly and so long after surgery? Would they drain it today, or would the risk of infection while I'm on chemo stop them. The pain is preventing me from sleeping easily, and I am really worried, but also quite frightened about what may happen. If they may keep me in today, then I need to put stuff in place now for the kids later. Any advice or help calming down would be very much appreciated! Many thanks. Yvonne",

They think the pain might either be muscular pain or some sort of unrelated lung problem - but they have reassured me that it's not mets, which was a huge relief. Life all of us, that's always my biggest fear.  I had a chest X-ray, and they'll ring with the results tomorrow, but the pain is so bad that breathing is really difficult, so although I don't want it to be anything wrong with the lungs, if they could pinpoint it quickly and sort it out easily then that would be good.

      "Content": "Hi Caroline, It's still such early days after your op - this is major surgery and a hugely life-changing event, plus with all the uncertainty and fear that this diagnosis brings - it's hardly surprising you feel like this right now, so please stop beating  yourself up and just go with the flow and let the emotions flow out with your tears - it's much better out than in. Ever since I was diagnosed five months ago, I've been relentlessly upbeat and cheerful, to the point whereby I thought I was doing so well - and then about 3 weeks ago I hit the depths of despair and spent over a week sobbing my heart out, totally negative and so desperately miserable. I think I'd bottled it up for so long, but the feelings for that week felt so awful that I thought I'd never be happy again. Yet this week, I've just had the best week I've had since diagnosis, felt really well, had loads of fun, and I've just packed 5 months of living into 5 days. I wouldn't have believed that was possible a couple of weeks back when I was so horribly low. You too will get through this, and in a few days time, once you're out the other side, you'll feel strong and happy and able to cope again. What's happening to you is perfectly normal and natural, but horrid, but it won't last forever. Spoil yourself, get others to look after you if you can, and indulge yourself if something nice - chocolate, cakes, rubbish telly, a glass of a decent red - they're the things that work for me - whatever it takes, just be as kind to yourself as you can be. Lots and lots of love and hugs, we've all been there. Yvonne xxxxxxxxx  ",
