    "Content": "I am glad I came across this thread. It is always good to receive recommendations and advice from other wig wearers. I use to buy from a lady in central London but her wigs and quality started to go down hill, also it was a bit of a commute since I am based in Peterborough. I currently buy my wigs from moramode.com the lady is patient and takes time to respond to your questions. What caught my eye is her wigs look very natural and the quality of the hair is good, I've had my current wig coming up to 6 months now. I do want to try some USAÂ stores and any recommendations for USA stores would be most welcomed.",
