      "Content": "Hi, six weeks ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I\u2019ve had a lumpectomy and SLB and now they say I have to have all my nodes removed as the cancer has spread and I\u2019ve more satellite growth around my breast. I\u2019m terrified this second time. Very low and weepy. I\u2019m still in pain under my arm and understand the full removal of lymph nodes is very painful. I\u2019m scared and worried. Not sleeping, so much going around my head. Is there anything I can do before I have another procedure to prepare for this?",
