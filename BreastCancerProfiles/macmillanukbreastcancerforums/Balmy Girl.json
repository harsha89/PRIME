    "Content": "Happy New Year everyone.  Let's hope it's a good one!   I start radiotherapy on Wednesday but have had a bad cough for several weeks now.  I was hoping it would have gone by now but it's still awful.  I also started a cold a week ago and today it got massively worse.  Typical - I'm usually very healthy.  I'm going to ring the hospital tomorrow for advice but wondered what experience you people have of radiotherapy with a really bad cold.",
