    "Content": "Hi Annie Sorry your eligible to join the club. I was diagnosed exactly a year ago tomorow with a small HER2+ tumour and cancerous involvement of 14 out 17 lymph nodes. Ive had the surgery, the chemo, the radiotherapy and am half way through a year of Herceptin and 6months into my 5yrs of Letrizole. I have been back at work full time for about 12 weeks. I wouldn't know how to even begin to describe the journey from last May to this May. Other than to say...it's do-able. Some bits hurt, some are scary, but they are ALL do-able.Â  The biggest most important thing that has helped me is keeping a sense of humour... there has been nothing I couldn't laugh at...example... I had a central excision which means removal of the centre of my breast and the nipple....they said I could have a nipple tattooed back on. My surgeon (who is fabulous) is callsed Mrs Anu Shotrie. Another consultant I saw in her absence said my scar was such a work of art I should have the surgeons name tattooed on it (like an artists signature) I thought about this but didn't think it would look so good....Anu S (true story, and there are a million more) Try to stay positive and BELIEVE that you will get through this.
