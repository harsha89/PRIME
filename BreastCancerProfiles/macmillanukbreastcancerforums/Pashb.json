    "Content": "I'm 39, diagnosed with grade 3, large-ish lump, and my regimen is 4 cycles of AC, followed by 4 cycles of taxol before surgery. FEC-T was never even mentioned to me. There's another girl I see at chemotherapy of a similar age on the regime as me, wonder if it's to do with size of lump and best 'cosmetic outcome' rather than fertility issues? They should have considered fertility when talking to you about your treatment, i know they talked to me quite a bit but to be honest i just wanted to get on and get rid of the lump. Sorry I can't be more help. Hope you get the answers you are after, the breast care nurses are superb with talking things through and chasing up answers so do use them.",
