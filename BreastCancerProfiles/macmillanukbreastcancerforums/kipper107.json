      "Content": "You will be fine, it won't necessarily be easy but it is doable. My oncologist told me to just get on with it, a bit harsh perhaps, but it worked for me.  I had 4 EC and 4 Tac with different side effects for each.  What I will say is that now that 6 months is over its like it never happened.  I know I was ill, I know it was hard but its done now and I seem to have forgotten about it.   I was much much worse about my surgery but thats done too so now radiotherapy is taking all my fears :). What I have learnt reading these forums is that NO experience is the same so you may well not get all of the side affects you read about.  I did lose my hair after 17 days but my nails are fine (with no black polish) and in fact seem to be stronger than they were :) Take every thing they offer you and the other thing I realised is that they only know your side effects if you tell them!! I was always very upbeat with my oncologist, perhaps showing him a bit more of my upset would have helped. ",

      "Content": "Hi just wanted to add my thoughts.  I lost my right leg below the knee 20 odd years ago and in November '13 I had a mammoplasty that involved me losing my right nipple.  Alongside all of this I was widowed at 33  five years after losing my leg. I then remarried at 38 - despite me being convinced no one would find me attractive with one leg.  Very sadly that marriage broke up after 14 years about 6 months before my cancer diagnosis.   I then went through 6 months of chemo, a mammoplasty, radiotherapy and a breast reduction on the other side, a years worth of treatment that finished last February. Last September I decided at 54 that I did not want to be alone and tried out an online dating site.  I started talking to a nice man but it suddenly occurred to me that I needed to tell him about the missing bits - a very stressful conversation! I didn't mention the missing nipple just that I had had extensive surgery for cancer. Anyway 4 months on I am still seeing the same man,  he has never once made me feel odd and to be honest he seemed a bit insulted that I thought it would matter.  I can only think that someone you are already in a relationship with won't care at all about your new appearance.  Not showing him may be making him thinks it's worse than it is..   hope that helps in ps in some way!        ",

      "Content": "Hi Your post really touched  me because I have felt very alone during this process.  My marriage broke up very unexpectedly in June 2012 after 15 years. I was completely shell shocked.  I really really struggled to get through the next few months but had just about survived when I found my lump in March this year.   My first few appointments I had people with me but I remember feeling so strongly that they were not the RIGHT people, the only person who should have been there was living it up with his new girlfriend and had completely moved on.  After I realised that I was also worried that my friend/sister were asking questions that scared me so I decided to do my appointments on my own.  It gave me back some control over what I told people and also I was frankly embarrassed having people talk about my nipples etc in front of other people.  I have not had children so this was probably the most intimate thing I have had to discuss. My surgeon is amazing but also young and gorgeous and the only way I could deal with the examinations was to completely disassociate myself from what he was doing by looking the other way.  I still do this now 9 months later! I am not saying dealing with stuff alone works for everyone, I can see that in some ways I have not helped myself by doing it this way BUT here I am 9 months later, 8 chemo completed, 1 therapeutic mammoplasty completed (i have an amazing new boob) and only radiotherapy to go.   I am 53 and frankly expect to spend my life on my own now but I appreciate it is very early days.  One of the hard things for me was that worrying about my health has stopped me rebuilding my life and all of sudden it has hit me massively that I am on my own.  I have a better relationship with my ex now but it is still very very painful.  He has been able to rebuild a new life and I am still stuck in my grief and sadness. Ultimately though neither of us have much choice now - you need to have this biopsy and see what it brings and i need to just get on with my radiotherapy etc.  Cancer seems to need 100% of our attention and I suppose there can be nothing more important than focusing on saving our lives.  I will be thinking of you tomorrow and I hope it goes well.  I have a Pinterest board full of inspirational quotes and one of them says  Everything is going to be all right, maybe not today but eventually. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi, was pleased your news is not too negative, hopefully it will all be sorted (information wise) before Christmas.   This whole cancer thing completely messes with your head and its hard to behave the same way as before it happened.   Sadly I have 2 friends with much \"worse\" cancer than me.  One of them has a blog and posted this comment from a sarcoma surgeon which is well worth reading.  I have been fortunate to have a surgeon who thinks like this and he has helped me so much. Immerse your head under water at a poolside. Around the pool you can hear the loudness of all the people around you. You dip your head to dive beneath the water. As you dive deeper these voices fade and become muffled. Submerged you know there is something out there but you are unable to understand it.  There is some security in not being able to hear exactly what is being said. In the water you feel somehow protected, but vulnerable because of this perceived security. Those standing outside the pool talking about you, trying to explain complexity to you. You hear a little but you choose to stay secure. This is where my patients go when they are diagnosed. When what I say to them does not quite sink in. That they do not fully grasp what I am saying. This is how I am feeling. There is a movie called Mask in 1985, it\u2019s images cross my mind. The boy in it has a rare disease, and he attempts to share what he understands about color with a blind girl. He takes a stone and explains blue by placing it in a freezer and then giving it to her. He explains red by giving her a stone that was thrust into hot coals.  I was 14 when I watched this movie. Incredibly done to truly explain color. Blue=cold, red=hot. Blind, deaf, or disabled. Can we as physicians really be sensitive to communicating accurately the true nature of cancer? Are we aware of the refraction index of our knowledge that feels to a patient like voices striking water while they are fully submerged? How can we measure understanding? How do we engage our patients in helping them make the right choices? Can I make them see color or feel it if they are blind? 30 min. That is the standard clinic slot for a patient. Seriously, is this the \u201cbusiness\u201d of medicine?  What happened to the art of healing? Can I tell someone their leg needs to be amputated in such a short time?  It is vitally important for me to offer each patient a chance to understand their disease. Sometimes in giving clarity, truth is not kind. Muffled is the outside voices. The truth cutting its way through. I sit in silence, my greatest teacher. Can I help my patient reach the surface to hear me loud and clear?",

      "Content": "Following on from my therapeutic mammoplasty and lymph node removal last Friday I have just been given some great news! All the cancer is out with clear margins and only 3 of 15 nodes affected. This means I won't need a mastectomy or the extended radiotherapy that had been discussed! Clearly this is amazing news! In addition I am not feeling too bad after the surgery with not too much pain. I still have one drain in but that should be out on Monday. Ultimately this is all down to my amazing surgeon, from the royal surrey in Guildford. He is probably the nicest doctor I have ever met and I had to trust his instincts. My gut feel was to have no surgery at all but his gentle insistence got me through. I know this is probably stupid but I have spent the last 24hrs saying I don't have cancer! All of a sudden it all seems very doable. Just need radiotherapy and a breast reduction now. Oh and 10 years tamoxifen of course :( I have not posted much but have read most of the mails that come my way, I have been surprised by the difference in experience and treatment but mainly just how many people are impacted by this disease. The range of info on this site has got me through some dark days and maybe this post will show someone that those test results are not always bad! I have had a nightmare 18mths with the breakup of my marriage, death of my father and since march this horrible thing. The day of my surgery my 21 year old stepson was in the Philippines when the typhoon hit and I just had to tell myself my bad luck had ended, luckily he is fine and maybe my bad luck HAS finally come to an end! Just one last question, I really really don't want radiotherapy, am I stupid to stop now? Kipper Ps lost all my hair, eye lashes and brows after 4 ec and 4 tac, finished chemo 8 weeks or so ago and now I have hair, not much but it's definitely there! Won't be sad to say goodbye to those hats",

      "Content": "Hi I have not been on the board for a while but I need some advice on Tamoxifen please. I originally started tamoxifen in Jan 2014 and carried on until September 2014.  I stopped because I became very very depressed and was struggling to function.  I was put on anti depressants but stopped the Tamoxifen at the same time.  Since then I have promised myself I would review the Tamoxifen decision and make a proper choice.  I spoke to my surgeon and oncologist both of whom said that I should take it and pointed out that my depression could have been as result of other factors such as the cancer treatment and a delayed reaction to my marriage breakup (this happened just before I was diagnosed).  They also told me my cancer (which had spread to the lymph nodes) was 8/8 for both hormones meaning it is very hormone receptive. So 2 weeks ago I finally took the plunge and started taking it. I have the Wockhardt brand and have been taking it at night.  Since then I have had a very upset stomach and headaches, last week I started to feel very very low and I am also have problems sleeping so on Friday I decided to stop again.  I am already feeling better (I know this may be psychosomatic) but I know in my head that this may be a silly decision.  I can cope with upset tummies and headaches but I am terrified of being that depressed again.   Since last September I have managed to get my life back on track, I am loving my work and doing well, I have a new man in my life and I have really started to enjoy life again.  I am still taking my anti depressants but had hoped to stop them soon.  My only side effects from my cancer are very achy arms (!) and hands but otherwise I am feeling OK.  So the question is, am I playing russian roulette with my life?  Has anyone else suffered from depression on Tamoxifen? Thank you!",

I think I also have an issue with tamoxifen as its a daily reminder that I had cancer - i just want to get on with my life with no reminders,  I know this is stupid and I may end up with no life but I seem to have a real block about this.  Did someone say that tamoxifen and citrolplan  (or however its spelt) were not a good combination?

The very interesting thing was that my surgeon fully supported me stopping, he made no attempt at all to persuade me which surprised me.  My oncologist has always been very keen on me taking it and has said I need 10 years.",

      "Content": "Hi I just wanted to post my experiences as sometimes this journey is OK.  I was diagnosed last March with grade 2 cancer with spread to my lymph nodes.  The timing was appalling, my husband had left me a few months earlier completely out of the blue, my dad was terminally ill (he died as I had my first chemo) and I am also disabled (I have an artifical leg). My treatment was 4 EC followed by 4 Tax - I started in late April and finished in late September.  I then had a theraputic mammoplasty in November and 25 rads starting in January.  I had a breast reduction on the good side in early February.  I am on Tamoxfen for 10 years. I actually managed to work through most of my treatment - i had a week off each chemo cycle and 4 weeks for my big surgery.  I am not saying this to show off but more to show people that sometimes its OK and you can be lucky with the side effects.    I took every drug they offered me and probably stayed on the pain killers more than most. My reasons for wanting to work were around the fact that it was the only stable thing left in my life, I had lost my marriage and health and without work I think I would have completely fallen apart. For all you newly diagnosed people please remember that it seems no two journies through this crap are the same and you may be lucky as I was.    I only realised just how lucky I was when I read some of the posts here. So 1 year on I am more than 2 stones lighter, have really nice short hair, I feel happy again and my new boobs mean I can wear clothes that I have never been able to wear before - I have gone down from a G/H cup to a D cup!  As I say not meaning to diminish your pain or grief but you may be lucky and get through this more easily than you expect. Final comment is that I did most of this alone as I was so angry with my husband, all my hospital visits etc, I thought if he wasn't there I didn't want anyone else.  This made it much harder for me but at the time I was furious (and very scared!!). ",

Although I had been told I would need a mastectomy they were able to do conservation surgery and it went very well.  I have just (yesterday) completed 23 radiotherapy sessions (your mam may not need this if she is having a mastectomy but they won't know yet).  So my message is 328 days after diagnosis I am fine and it was all OK.  I know its really scary but you will get your mam through this.  Good luck, ask questions and look after your mam!",

When I said I had private health I was able to see the same person the next day.  (I appreciate this is not fair or right).  My treatment has been fantastic, I see my oncologist every cycle,  I have the same team treating me each time and I have access to all the drugs.  My oncologist speaks to my NHS surgeon regularly and it really feels joined up.  The only drawback is that the NHS BCN nurse has not been available but this is apparently due to my oncologist wanting his team. I don't feel its about them making money its more that they can give me everything I need without worrying.  The biggest benefit for me is that I have been able to work throughout this process and this is one of the the things that has got me through this. The other comments have also been interesting as its clear there is a subtext to my post that I wasn't even aware about!   ",

      "Content": "Hello all I have not posted much (just once I think) but have received so many email updates on other people's journeys that I wanted to post my experience. Firstly a bit about me.  I am 52, (well 53 in a few days).  I live on my own in Surrey following a very nasty breakup last year.  My husband left me after 15 years with no warning and I was completely floored by it. I also had some serious family issues to deal with including terminal cancer (my dad) and a stroke (my step dad).  I have had some pretty hard issues to deal with in my life including losing my leg at 29 and being widowed at 33 so I am now seen as one of those \"strong\" people. I felt my lump in March, doctor said not to worry but sent me to specialist clinic where I was diagnosed same day.   Saw specialist very quickly and was told I had multi focal cancer with spread to lymph nodes. Largest tumour was around 5cm.  Later found out it was er+.  I opted for chemo first and was lucky enough to have private health care so had this done in my local private hospital.  I was prescribed 4 EC and 4 Tax and have now completed 7 with my final session in 2 weeks. I think I have been lucky symptom wise but i have worked through out with a week off after each treatment.  I don't feel great but working seems to have helped.  I have had no infections or problems really, I have had the Neulasta injection each time which looks to have helped.   Hairwise I tried the cold cap but lost a large amount of hair in one area so gave up.  I actually was not as upset about my hair as I thought i would be but i do avoid looking at myself a lot :) Have wigs but found them too hot so have been wearing turbans/hats out of the house.  I was more sad about my eyebrows and eye lashes as it felt like I was disappearing and becoming very blurred without their definition.  I suppose this was sort of how I felt about the whole thing. I am now thinking about surgery, have a great surgeon but he does not yet do private so would have to continue on NHS - sure it will be fine but I want to make the right choice.  I really like my surgeon, he is young and positive, he has been calling me every few weeks which is nice too.  He started saying MX was very likely but now due to the response to the chemo is talking about conservation surgery.   I think the surgery is the really worrying bit for me, I am concerned that my only way of coping with this whole thing is to not think about it, I literally live from hour to hour.  I am worried that I am simply not thinking of the options and may just make  a decision on the fly.   But looking at the booklets etc is terrifying.   I also feel a bit wierd about discussing it with people, he has told me I will lose my nipple and I simply don't want to talk to people about that, its just too intimate.  I feel the sadness about the loss of my marriage so much more now as he would have helped and made me fight this. I also think I am a bit lucky that I have already come to terms with a changed body image, I live with being an amputee and that is more visible and more impacting than the loss of a breast so in some ways that really helps (or is that just an avoidance technique to avoid thinking about it?) Support wise I am a bit isolated. I have some good friends who have helped,  a sister who stays during chemo, a mum who has also helped (but she has my elderly step dad too).   I have had no formal support, the BCN assigned has not spoken to me since I moved my chemo to private but she is more available now I am talking to my surgeon again.  I simply haven't built  a relationship with her despite being 6 mths into this.  My oncologist is great but very old school and any information I have I have had to ask for.  I asked him my prognosis at the last chemo and he said 75%, not sure if this is good or bad but at least I know now :) Not sure what response I am looking for really but just wanted people to know that its all different and individual, there seems to be no right path.  In a perfect world my husband would have been here supporting me but hes not and I have still made it almost to the end of chemo even on my own.  My big \"bugbear\" is the whole strong thing, would love people to see that its not about being strong, there is simply no choice.  Anyway thanks for reading.",

      "Content": "So here I am almost 11 months after diagnosis and I am all done.  I had my final surgery (reduction on the good side) on Monday and last Friday the oncologist told me he didn't need to see me for 6 months. Its incredible to believe that the thing that has filled my mind for the last year is over.  I am reading the cancer survivors handbook as I can see that this is not going to be as easy as I would have thought.   I have had a really bad 18 months but today I feel happy so I am going to enjoy it while it lasts. I haven't posted many times here but when I have I have always received thoughtful and insightful comments - thank you to everyone who has listened to me. Still in two minds about reading this forum going forward but I know I could not have got this far without it and the forum members. Thank you and good luck in your journeys.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed a few weeks ago,  multi focal with spread to lymph nodes but luckily ct and bone scans clear.  Decided to have chemo first as surgery seemed like a massive deal.  Had my first EC on friday and have felt pretty awful since then.   My life has completely imploded in the last 9 months and I honestly don't know how I will do this.  My husband of 14 years left me completely out of the blue last June and my father and step father both had serious illnesses.  My dad died last Saturday so I spent last week at his funeral and cremation in Ireland followed by portacath insertion on Thursday and chemo on Friday.  I am not sure I can have another week like that.   I so want to keep working but my head is all messed up and that is making me very very scared.  I am trying to sort out the financial settlement that will mean I keep my house and thats all scary too.   To add to it all I am an amputee following a car accident some years ago so already have some mobility difficulties.   I am trying not to read stuff as it just freaks me out,  I am just planning on the next 30 minutes at a time.  I have had to learn to be independent in the last 9 mths since he left me and I hate having to ask for help.    I am 52 and the surgeon and oncologist both seem very upbeat about my prospects and have said they will throw everything they can at me to get me through it. I am just not sure I can take that.  My chemo is being done privately (but surgery will be NHS) so its all been very quick.  Plan is 4 cycles of EC plus 4 of Tax.  I was in 2 minds about the cold cap but oncologist was very keen for me to try it so I had that as well, funnily enough that was no where near as bad as I expected. I live on my own with my lovely cat Kipper, unfortunately he has a bit of a biting habit and thats also adding to my anxiety.  All in all not a good time. Anyway thanks for reading...        ",
