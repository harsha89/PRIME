      "Content": " I'm new to this so hope its okay to comment here... I've had this problem with a white spot on my left nipple and it first came up a number of months ago I'd say about 5-6months and it just hasn't gone away, it just won't go away and it is causing me pain and making it hurt when I put a bra on and I get really bad aching and stabbing pains.. I'm really worried and just wondered what I should do? I've been told it could be hormones but that was ages ago and it's never gone away or gotten any smaller, any advice is appreciated, I wanna go doctors but don't wanna seem stupid. ",

      "Content": "I'm really worried but I've already been up hospital so much do to my seizure in September and the scans to do with that and also been referred finally about a problem I've had down below, been suffering with pain practically every day for over two years.. I've had all sexual health tests done and it's been all clear every time but yeah the pain gets so bad that I end up in tears or physically sweating and unable to walk without being in extreme pain most days, I'm living off painkillers.. Been having all sorts of problems with it and I'm so scared really, they've finally referred me for an internal scan and the new doctor I have said she's shocked I wasn't helped sooner, every time there is blood in my urine and with the other problems my heads a mess, the pain killers have become a way of life now...  I wanna get this internal scan done with and hopefully a solution sorted before I go in about this problem.. Im a mess really, so scared about it all.. This white spot just won't go and I keep getting stabbing pains in this boob as well the nipple being itchy and cracked a lot of the time no matter what I do.. Sorry this is so long and thank you for the support, just feel alone really got no family to turn to, I have my boyfriend but feel I stress him out by going on and on which is understandable xx",
