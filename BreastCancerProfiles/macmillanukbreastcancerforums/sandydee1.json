      "Content": "I hope people don't mind as i am wanting some advice after feeling confused after a mammogram. A couple of months ago i found a lump in my breast that hasn't gone down. After going to the doctors he referred me for a mammogram as he could feel some hard thickening of the breast. At the clinic the nurse felt both the lump and the thickening and said my lymph nodes were swollen. I had a mammogram, then was sent for an ultra sound scan. The doctor called me in and said i can't feel any lumps so i will discharge you. Great! Is what i first thought, until i have been thickening lots of thinks since. Was there a lump? Why were my lymph nodes swollen? Am i right to still be anxious, or just over thinking things.Â  I thought other peoples experiences might my help to know if i just leave things or go back to my doctor. Thanks everyone",

      "Content": "Hi I managed to speak to the breast clinic nurse this morning. She got my results up and said the notes had said there was thickening to the breast tissue, but nothing to worry about. The nurse said the good thing now is that when i have a future mammogram they will now have something to compare to. I'm glad i phoned back and went with my gut feeling.",
