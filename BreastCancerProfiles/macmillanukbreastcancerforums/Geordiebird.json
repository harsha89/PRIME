    "Content": "Hi, I'm pretty much on my own dealing with the news that I have early stage breast cancer (1b) i have been offered tamoxifen and chemo therapy (this news has come 2 mnth after having duct removal). Im really worried as many of my immediate family have had no luck with chemo and breast cancer survival rates in my family are 0. Has anyone chosen to go natural therapies rather than chemo? I know im not in as bad a position as most but would really like the opinion of someone who has tried. Really scared right now and the only info i can go on is what is in the leaflets or anything i google. Please help",
