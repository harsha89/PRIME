    "Content": "I sympathise with your itchy side effect which I have also. Head to toe.  I have creams and a strong antihistamine. I'm on 10mg of everolimus a day. I find E45 anti itch helpful. I also had tooth ache and foolishly went to the dentist who inflicted even more pain. Eventually resolved by antibiotic.  Best of luck with your ongoing treatment.",
