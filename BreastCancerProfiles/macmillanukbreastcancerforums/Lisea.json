Having today had what I consider to be good news in that I had clear margins from my WLE 2 weeks ago and that only 2 out of the 19 nodes removed were cancerous I now have the prospect of chemo and herceptin later to be followed by tamoxifen.  I have an appointment with the oncology team on Tuesday 6th however I would like to know if there is anything I can do to prepare myself emotionally and physically for chemo. I am also hoping to go back to work on 12th on a phased return (want to be part of Christmas festivities). Thanks",

I am so pleased you have provided so much info. I like detail. I did have a hairloss meltdown earlier this week and found one of the hair specialist at my local mcmillan centre really helpful to allay some of my fears. I will hear what the team say on tuesday and then make the decision about work then Again thank u very much.  Take care BW L",

It has worked a treat.  If you have some gauze you could ask other half to cover it for you. The hospital gives me a couple of sleeves each time it is flushed as they don't last long after washing.  Lisea",
