    "Content": "Hi all, A little bit of background to start with.  My wife found out just over a week ago that she had breast cancer, and we went to see the consultant today to get the results of the mammogram/MRI and discuss treatment options. He told us that there were two types of cancer (in the same lump I think) - an invasive ductal one of 1.5 cm and a non-invasive one of 7cm.  Initial signs are that the cancer has not spread to any lymph nodes.  He recommended a full masectomy and lymph node removal, 6 sessions of chemotherapy over 18 weeks, and one years worth of herceptin, with possible radiotherapy after that. After a brief phone call to an oncologist he recommended the chemo and herceptin first, with surgery in a years time, but said there was very little to choose between doing it that way and doing surgery first with chemo and herceptin afterwards. My wife chose to have the surgery first as she really wants to get the cancer out of her body, and they have managed to fit her in this Friday.  My wife really does not want to have chemo as she is scared of the side effects and the effect that the changes on her will have on our two children (6 and 3 years old) My questions are: If the masectomy is successful and tests show the cancer has not spread to any lymph nodes, what are the benefits of having chemo?  Any statistics would be particularly useful as these seem to be hard to find on the internet. My wife is 31 and the consultant said he was recommending chemo partly because of her age.  Why does her age matter? A lot of sites seems to recommend 'life style changes' to prevent a further recurrence.  My wife already gets sufficient exercise, has a BMI of 22.5, doesn't smoke or drink and eats plenty of vegetables.  Is there anything else you would recommend? Are there any complementary things she should be doing to help? At the moment she is adding tumeric to a lot of food.  Is there anything else? Thanks in advance for any help you can give",
