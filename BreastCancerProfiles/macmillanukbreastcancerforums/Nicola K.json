    "Content": "Hi Further to what Dorothee said I agree so much, it is so important to be open and honest and allow them to share in your journey no matter how hard. I truely beleive this helps the healing process. My Mom was diagnosed on 31st October with secondary breast cancer in the brain and told everyone initially not to inform the Grandchildren as she was scared something would go on facebook before my son was informed who was 4 hours away in University and it wasnt something we wanted to do over the phone. My partner who is a wonderful caring mad set off the Friday Morning to go fetch him getting to the hospital 9pm that night and the nurses allowed the late visit due to the distance travelled. We took him back on Monday and at my sons request I kept him informed keeping the deterioration from him as we all felt there was hope and she would be scheduled for whole brain radiation. We did inform him of the treatment as we knew that when he next came home she would have started and would be extremly fatigued so needed to prepare him for that. Unfortunately a week before the traetment was to commence and a feeding peg to be inserted (she didnt want him to see her with the feeding tube in her nose) she started to deteriorate. On Thursday 21st November they informed me she was dying and could stop breathing at any time. My partner set off to fetch my son as I knew she needed to see him and he needed her. My niece and I sat with her all of Thursday night and the nurses kept asking when her grandson was coming, they believed she would pass anytime and both my neice and I believe she was dying but held on. She kept asking where he was and how much longer and why was it taking to so long.......... My son arrived at 12:45 early Friday morning where we gave him time alone although she was not fully conscious at this point. When she woke she was initially disorientated and my sone was scared she did not recognised him. She suddenly looked at him, held out her arms with a look of joy on her face and said his name..... That is something he will carry for the rest of his life, the look of joy and that is what he said is most vivid in his mind despite the next few days which were extremely difficult, He knew she loved hime and he loved her She sadly passed away on the Sunday morning just over 3 weeks after diagnosis within seconds after a prayer by the hospital chaplain peacefully Grandchildren like children are specail and need to know that they are important, often we make a decision that things re too hard but what they find the hardest is the fact that they do not know what is going on and suddenly there is a massive  void...... Your Grandaughter shows a maturity beyond her years and her love for you is apparent Nicola xxx  ",
