    "Content": "Hello all -  after a routine mamogram and lump removal in June this year I underwent   a \" bilateral skin sparring mastectomy\",  in August,  I agree Kaz  it was definitely good (from my point of view) to see something there (albiet tiny) when I first woke up!  I then underwent further node sampling op four weeks later . Just wanted to say how empowered I feel since joining this wonderfull forum and thanks to you all for sharing  your stories it has been a really positive experience FOR ME  and has ensured each and every one of us always has someone to talk to (apart from immediate family and friends whom I am like many others , feel often unable to share at risk of upsetting them!) and stopped myself  and many others from feeling very vulnerable and  alone! THANKS AGAIN Stay strong and sending out lots of positive vibes to you all  lots of love xxxx",
