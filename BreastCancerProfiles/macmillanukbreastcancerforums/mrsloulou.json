    "Content": "Hi You dont actually say what your diagnosis was - however I know exactly how you feel. I was diagnosed with grade 2 cancer in January and had a left side mastectomy in February. I know exactly the feelings you are describing. I wish I could tell you they just disappear, but they don't. The feelings do change when yu have a treatment plan and can start focusing on getting rid of the cancer by whatever means. Things do then start to feel a bit less panicky. Enjoy the lunch and have a laugh. Get cooking that dinner :) Good luck",
