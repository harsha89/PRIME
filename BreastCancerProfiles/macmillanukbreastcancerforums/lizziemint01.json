      "Content": "Hi I had sentinel lode biopsy 12 days ago & had same thing under my arm pit after 10 days after surgery. I had it drained wednesday but it has filled up again. i believe that slowly the body will absorb it back but its uncomfortable. I am going to ask if they re-drain it won't the same thing happen? Maybe I have have to wait for my body to readjust, apparently its the bodys way of filling up cavities. Don't worry, ask if you can have it drained & see what happens. Mine  is worse in the day & seems to be easier in the morning when I get up then swells up. Hope this helps. Helen",

      "Content": "Hi there,  I do not know what Zoladex is but I too am suffering from joint pain in my elbow on operated side  (WLE,SNB & Rads 2 months ago) & I am taking tamoxifen. I had clear margins & no lymph nodes affected but have started to worry \"why is my elbow hurting\". I saw my surgeon & she said nothing to worry about. I have done some swimming and a lot of walking for a marathon and wonder if that affected it. I am 50 and had anyway started getting joint pain in knees, wrist etc (part of getting old I suppose). At a breast cancer support meeting it seems elbow pain is not unusual, for me it hurts when i try and pick up something heavy.Its not so bad to take pain killers & I hope it will ease off. I hope this helps you as you are not alone in experiencing this. Hope it settles for you.",

      "Content": "Hi Jenny Hope you are trying to stay strong. I too was in the same position as you. I was diagnosed in May with 1.7 cm lump & had Lumpectomy & Sentinel Lode Biopsy. In the event it turned out to be 1cm Invasive Lobular Cancer (less common) but I had clear margins & 4 clear lymph nodes., ER postive cancer. I start radiotherapy in two days but need no chemo (yipee). Trust me you will have very tearful days and fearful days but gradually you will come to accept whats happened and focus on getting rid of the cancer. The surgery honestly for me was no problem. I went home the same evening, took painkillers for 24 hours then was okay. I had a small swelling (seroma) that was drained but after that it went of its own accord.For me the hard part of all this  is the mental bit, not the physical side. I have had days when I just have been crying on and off all day.I am taking Tamoxifen too and have wondered if that has affected me but I think it really is a shock to the system. Gradually you will feel stronger, I am normally a really strong positive person everyone tells me how brave I am, but underneath I have been quaking. However now some 6 weeks down the line I am coming to terms with it all. Honestly its not easy, but you will find the strength.Do I want this cancer to ruin every day invading my head. NO. So i try and block it out and just get on with life. One day I think I will wake up and not give it a second thought. I am not yet there but confident I will be. I am 50 so I don't have the fertility issues you have so I can't help you there. I hope you have good family & friends around you to help support you. Also personally I find this site such a help. There are really good posts & advice. I haven't spoken to a Mammillan nurse yet but may pop in to their office when I start my RT- just to talk to someone who is an expert. Anyway if you need any advice just message me, we are all going through the same battle, treatment is so much better these days, you will get over this. Best wishes Helen.",
