    "Content": "Hi, i've been taking Tamoxifen for a short time and the only side effects i've had are hot flushes. Although they happen frequently they do only last for a few seconds. My hormone receptor scores were both 8 so not taking it wasn't really an option for me and on a personal level, i feel that so many people have used their skills and knowledge to cure me and give me a second chance at life, It doesn't matter what they offer me medication wise, i'll take it all gladly!   ",
