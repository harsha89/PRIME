      "Content": "Hi Bev, that sounds same as me. 6 treatments at three week intervals. Three of FEC which is a combination treatment and then three of Docetaxil (taxotere) I'm given three tablets before we start followed by a Steroid drip and two bags of fluids. I'm guessing That my tablet equivalent to yours is Dexamethasone. I get one Aprepitant and two Dexamethasone. The Aprepitant was added to combat nausea and has been very effective and dex I believe is the steroid that also stops you feeling sick as well. Sounds like they may do similar jobs. I take them on the day of treatment and for three days after along with a couple of others that have been added in after round 1 review. Maybe Dreamthief can encourage my laziness to read in to it at this time of the night and confirm if the drugs do similar jobs. :-) xx",

All I can say is it's never too late to change your mind but speak to your oncologist again until you are completely satisfied with their reasons for choosing this as the right course of treatment for you. They are the experts and will have chosen what's best. although 4 months seems a long time my personal experience, having completed the FEC part of my treatment yesterday, is that it has flown in. I'm not looking forward to the next one as it's more aggressive but it's 9 weeks of my life. It might be a rough 9 but when it's done it's done. I know this doesn't give you the specific answers you need but I'm sure you won't be alone on this treatment plan and others will share their experiences soon. Good luck for the coming months xxx",

She apologised, but when I said that it's not often we get a birthday present that can ultimately save our lives she agreed that it wasn't that bad after all. I have four more chemo sessions ahead. I like to think that in two more weeks I am half way there :-). I'm to have radiation after chemo but not sure how many. 15 seems to be the norm. I had my surgery RBM on 7th July and next year hope to have my reconstruction. I'm hoping to have the DIEP flap ...I was born with this tummy for a reason ;-) I feel very lucky that my treatment is going so much easier than most. Apart from being easily tired and little appetite (lost a stone in 7 weeks!!! I've been trying to do that for years!!! ) I have nothing at all to complain about.

However only two attempts after an hour in a heat blanket did it this time. Unfortunately I have chemical phlebitis but exercising has helped a lot. I thought I could avoid antibiotics but my neutrophils have dropped to just above the level where chemo would be delayed so it's antibiotics after all. So that's the story so far....what's the low down on Docetaxil, who did their own steroid injections? did you feel like a train ran you over ? Did your nails fall off ? I hated that scene in The Fly!! I'm hoping my care team have painted the absolute worst case scenario!! So would love to hear your experiences good n bad. Oh and have you gained weight?

I think I had every side effect you could imagine with T. Muscle pain, cramps, stomach pain, nausea, heartburn. A rash, hot flushes, the skin peeled off my feet and I got blisters and sores on my hands and I can't stay awake. But you know what it's such a short time compared to the rest of your life. Cry when you feel like it...I did more than once. But when it's really bad tell yourself tomorrow will be better. I ended up with loads of drugs for the second cycle to counteract the side effects. I practically rattled and will do again for the next three weeks. They are great. They gave me Gabapentin for the pain. It's a drug used for epilepsy but also controls nerve pain. I was pretty spaced most of the time but it did give me relief. Ps I was sick to death of being told to stay positive. Look forward all the time but if you feel crap don't give youself a guilt trip about not being smiley smiley....you're allowed.

My drains were out on day 2 but while they were in I carried them around in a cotton shoulder bag. I found the biggest discomfort was from the back of my armpit and down the inside of my arm. It was more of an unpleasant sensation rather than pain. If you sleep on your side hug a pillow and drape your arm over it. I also found a great cushion that fits in to your underarm that really helps when in bed or just relaxing. Have a look at www.tendercrush.co.uk. Make sure to do any physio recommended but don't overdo it. Good Luck for tomorrow x one step closer to being healthy again x",

I'm having six sessions FEC-t then rads then five years on Letrozole and I see it as the belt and braces option. Chuck it all at me if it reduces the chances of recurrence. I've just had my second chemo. I felt extremely nautious after the first session but was never actually sick. Lucky Compared to others. How I had been was taken into account before session 2 and my anti emetics were increased and two more introduced. In all honesty I feel just fine. The drugs are great and it doesn't have to be a horror story. The unknown is sometimes much more frightening than reality. Go with the advice of your consultant and ask what he would do if it was his family or him. Hope it all goes well for you x",

I am amazed that you have been willing to endure two years of uncertainty, hospital visits, time spent in waiting rooms when by now you could either be in remission with conventional treatment or at worst having the cancer controlled. Which seems to be where you are now. I was 57 when diagnosed less than 4 months ago. Probably around the same age as you when you were. My breasts and my hair were my two best features. They had stood the test of time :-) but they are replaceable, repairable and ultimately I would rather be rid if the beast that invaded my body in the quickest and most effective way (for me). The NHS is an often maligned institution but I can only be thankful that it is there for all if us. Without experimental treatment no advances would be made but in your shoes I would follow the conventional path so I could get on to my new one without delay. I sincerely hope your choices are the right ones for you and will keep up with your posts with interest. Xx",

If it's any help at all I cried for Britain before I got my results. The fear of the unknown was far more difficult for me to deal with than fact. Once I got my results I found it easier to cope and focus on the road ahead which is now clearly mapped. I've had 2 sessions if chemo with four to go so neatly half way there. It's radiation next and then reconstruction. In my own mind I'm more reassured by the fact that I'm having chemo because I see it as the belt and braces approach. If any of the nasty little so n so's have wandered unseen their days are numbered!! Good Luck for Thursday and don't be scared to let your tears out when they need to xx better out than in x.
