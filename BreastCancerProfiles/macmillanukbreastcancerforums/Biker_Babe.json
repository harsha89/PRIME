      "Content": "Hi Tally, No, I'm not from Nottingham, I'm from Lockerbie, but I too had a lumpectomy then a cavity shave.  I start 25 zaps or radiotherapy a week on Monday.  Think everyone's treatment is slightly different, it seems to depend where you are being treated from what I can gather.  Good luck with whatever comes next.",

      "Content": "I had 25 zaps, the skin went very red even with using the aqueous cream several times each day right from the 1st.  I even used it in the shower.  My nipple went crusty about 3 weeks after I finished but the crust just came off.  Looked really strange. The only problem I have had since is the tiredness which just comes all of a sudden and there is nothing I can do about it. Also, the fact that that breast is so much smaller than the other one, a full cup size, most disconcerting.  Anyone any advice on this?  Chicken fillets dont work for it - I've tried them all.",
