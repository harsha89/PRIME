    "Content": "Hi there, i am on my last session of tax on the 27th nov i to have had FEC didnt find it to bad, thankfully no sickness but the shakes were bad n the weakness was hard to deal with i am a very active person and not to be able to get on and do things was terrible for me. my hair came out about 3 weeks after the 1st FEC,woke up in the morning and rubbed my head only to find most of my hair in my hand n on the pillow...lovely! but i decided not to bother with wigs n bandanas they made my head itch to much. but oddly enough after the 2nd FEC it started to grow back...Also mouth ulsers were bad on FEC.  Tax i found easier than FEC  again not unbearable, achey joints was the worst bit n the steroids made me sweat like mad especially at night. i had to have the GCSF injections after the tax, they aint nice at all, made the joints really painful even down to my finger tips i think if it werent for the GCSF tax would have been a brease!! also watch out for the squirts i had this bad on tax..but all in all i have been lucky. dont forget everyone reacts diff so fingers crossed you will fly through it all,,my hair now is about 2mm long grey n black patches..kids say i will look like a badger. seems to still be growing on the TAX i can even feel the wind in it lol Just !!!   x x x",
