    "Content": "Hi I am Rachel, new to the forum. I have already learned lots reading the posts on here, thanks all! I am very fortunate in that my cancer was grade one and they did not put me through chemo! I finished radiotherapy just before Xmas 2007 and the breast is still sore like yours Maureen. There is still a very itchy red patch underneath the breast and the flesh feels lumpy. I get upset lately thinking that they have \"cooked\" me and that the breast will always feel alien to me now. Anyone else feel this way? Also its grown 2 cup sizes bigger than the other one which means bras are now a problem! Do they shrink back eventually? I know I am lucky, I still have it, almost feel guilty complaining, but would love to share with others in similar stage. Best of luck to all xxx",
