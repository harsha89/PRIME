      "Content": "Hi Rebecca T, I'm new to this so please forgive any mistakes! I had an mx last November and immediate recon with definitive implant. I'm curious that you were able to get a second mx and recon to balance you up, and presumably also this would prevent any cancer in second breast. Was this offered as a choice to you? And also, do you have any advice re nipple reconstruction/prostheses etc? Hope you don't mind me picking up on your reply, but having coped well practically with the mx I am feeling a bit up and down emotionally, and with an all male family tend to bottle it up.",

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, thank you for your reply. Have seen your website and admire your strength in fighting this battle, and your confidence! I have lost the entire nipple with the mx, and reading around it seems as though reconstructed nipples may not be permanent, so I am really struggling to know what to do for the best. I realise this is unimportant in the scheme of things compared to what a lot of ladies here are going through, and my heart goes out to everyone in this 'club', just wondering if anyone has advice..
