    "Content": "Hi  I had a double  mastectomy and ANC clearances in Sep. 2013, I'd take in button up pyjamas a dressing gown with side pockets so you can push the pockets to the outside then stick drain bottles in pockets. I purchased  many different bras but would recommend M+S post surgery as I used them  until after reconstruction, Which was 18 months later due to chemo and radiotherapy. Do bra up in the front then pull round to back a lot easier I still have to do it this way but your be surprised how quickly you find away to do things. Also pull on clothes and stretchy t-shirts make life easier and less stressful good luck",
