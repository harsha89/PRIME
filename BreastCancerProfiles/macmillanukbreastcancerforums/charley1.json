      "Content": "Hi Rebecca Thanks so much for replying. I had a look at your blog and tbh you wouldn't say you'd had anything done the results are amazing. I'm waiting on pamphlets and info but they don't tell you what ladies like yourself have been through and the results. I'm not a small lady (34dd) but like you to me they are a big asset and they are mine lol! I will be in touch and thanks again x",
