      "Content": "Hello, I have Peripheral Neuropathy in my hands and feet after having chemo. It will be five years since having cancer later on this year. I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced twitching!  My body keeps twitching all over, from my head to my toes....sometimes I do some big twitches and I almost feel like its the start of a seizure but its not, its just one or two big twitches.  I have a bad leg that has some nerve damage and sometimes this leg will do a big twitch/jerk and it really hurts because its moved the painful nerves in my leg.   What I decided to do is to sit comfortably in my armchair whilst watching tv, and see just how much I really twitch, and I found the I twitch ever such a lot, not a minute between each twitch sometimes, but the twitches can be so small that they are not visible to the eye, the twitch is actually inside my body....so I go from tiny little faint twitches to big large twitches.  It seems I am unable to control them or stop them no matter how much I try, and to be honest they are a pain.  Even just sitting here in my chair with my laptop I can feel my legs twitching, and my toes and behind my knees twitch....it is just so strange but it seems to be getting worse...ive never seen anything like this and never heard of anyone having it.  If I am trying to send a text to someone, my fingers will twitch and push a button with the force of the twitch so the message is all garbled up!! I laugh about it but sometimes it just drives me mad, and one of the funny things is I can be laying in bed and my right arm ( the cancer side) will suddenly lift itself up, just from the elbow to the hand but is like ive gone to wave to someone, but I have not moved my arm, its done it all by itself, its so weird lol...Does anyone else have this, is it a side effect of the taxol maybe....I would love to hear from you if you do have this.",
