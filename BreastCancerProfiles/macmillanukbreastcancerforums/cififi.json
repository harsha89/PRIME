    "Content": "Hi LondonLass, I felt I had to write to you as I was going through something very similar. I had a double mastectomy with implants which was OK in terms of the operation etc. But I too developed chronic pain that I could not manage. Even the strongest painkillers could not make a dent in it. Like you, I tried to explain it to doctors and felt that they did not really understand or take it seriously. I found it hard to find the words to describe it. However after almost 6 months it has much improved and I can now function again and am back working. What really helped me was the following: Even though I didn't want to, I took sleeping tablets so that I could get that much needed sleep that helped my state of mind As the pain I had  was nerve pain,  finally the doctors explained that it can take up to 6 months to heal (just an average). So for this\"hyperaestheisa\" I took \"Capsaicin\" cream. This is totally natural but as it is made from Chilli you need to make sure that your skin can support it. For me it worked great. I noticed a big improvement since day 1 of using it. Walking for an 45-1 hr every day regardless of weather. So I am in a much better place. I still have pain but it is bearable and I expect it to really be 100% gone in a few months at the latest. and my last bit of advice to you is that you should get your doctor to refer you to a pain management specialist or clinic. This was going to be my last resort if nothing else worked. I hope this is helpful. Hang in there. And if you want the name of other \"alternative medicine\" I use just get back in touch. all the best!",
