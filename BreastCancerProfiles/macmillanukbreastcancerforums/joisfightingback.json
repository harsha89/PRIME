    "Content": "Try and take a deep breath and stop beating yourself up,  I too have had the pains and lumps and driven myself crazy in the past.   Twelve years on and i have a new cancer unrelated to my last battle and i am in a state of calm regarding the cancer.  Just go to your doctor explain your concerns and be patient -  its the waiting game again. I used to feel for lumps - found one on holiday - cut the trip short by two days flew home in a raging panic frought tearful and almost crackers.   Only to find it was new scar tissue forming.  I swore then to never put myself through it again. I now worry about the bills lol Keep yourself busy and talk to your friends when you feel the need Hope this helps JO",
