      "Content": "Hi It was never my intention to judge sorry if it came across like that, its always hard to read or write a post without knowing its full intention. I have read many that agree or disagree with Shave the Brave and see where they are coming from. Everyone has their own way of supporting their loved ones and i would like to think that those that shave in moral support of a friend have discussed their feelings about it  with each other fully beforehand and have made an informed decision that's best for them. I see where you are coming from completely on the juxtaposition. I don't think anyone tries to trivialise by shaving in support or doing it in a fun atmosphere i just think they want to support in a way they know how in their own familiar environments. I am sure Macmillan listens to its members and will take all their thoughts into consideration when making a decision whether or not to continue promoting Brave the Shave . Well done to you in your fund raising its fantastic. Best wishes",

      "Content": "Don't worry or get hung up about how others choose to support their family and friends its up to them. My daughter has just shaved her head in support of her friend and not for one single minute has she thought that this act would be seen as sharing her friends experiences. She simply did it too raise money and show her moral support and knew that this was something she could too raise money fast. its the sticking together that counts.  x",
