      "Content": "Hi, Luckily I didn't need chemo based on the oncogene score being 5 but a friend of mine has just had it and she wore the cold cap and doesn't appear to have lost much if any hair! She also got her eye brows tattooed on just in case!  Good luck, it's awful having to make such rubbish decisions...my next step is reconstruction and whether to go for Diep or an implant! Much love Sasha",
