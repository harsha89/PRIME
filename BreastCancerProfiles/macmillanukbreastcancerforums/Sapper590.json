    "Content": "Hello Noodles, my nails were cracking, splitting and breaking in layers while I was on chemotherapy, I was telling a nurse about them when I went for a CT Scan, she said to go to Boots and buy some nail varnish called \"Hard as Nails\" it was brilliant,  certainly did the trick,  no more broken or split nail, but all my mates pulled my leg lol but that didnt worry me as my nails were good again. Been of chemo now 7 weeks and everything is coming back to normal thank goodness. Im now having Ablation.   Take care, keep smiling. ",
