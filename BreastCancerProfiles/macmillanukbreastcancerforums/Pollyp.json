      "Content": "Hi. I finished rad's at beginning of year and was lucky enough that my gp had no hesitation in prescribing r1 & r2 when I asked for it. Now couldn't possibly say if it was just luck or the creams but I had not trouble or blistering at all during or after treatment.  After seeing posts on here about how some gps are reluctant to prescribe and people have to buy their own I thought I'd offer my unused packs to anyone who wants them. I have 4 boxes of r2 (56 in box) and 15 sachets r1. I also have 2 new clean white cotton hankies which can be used to protect clothes after application. Hope this can help someone. ",

I had an appointment with onco doctor on Friday and he really pushed and pulled me about :-( Up until then I had been getting on perfectly with regard healing, wound and pain. Now I am in quite a lot of pain  (taking painkillers again) and my breast is noticeably redder on the bottom part which it wasn't before.  I don't have a temperature but don't feel my normal self.  Is this normal...or as normal as can be expected? I'm wondering whether I should ring doctor on morning? I have heard something about blood supply after a reduction? ",

I had my post surgery results yesterday DCIS, with some invasive grade 1, I had a WLE with reduction surgery and now Rads and Tamoxifen to come, no dates yet.  Today has mainly been digesting for me - how about you?. Let me know how you get on. Sending kind thoughts x",

I to am a 'plus size' (although sounds like you have been doing well in that dept!) so in response to original and all other posts just want to echo the please don't feel upset for not fitting the normal...whatever that is.  Finding a bra with larger size back and smaller cup is near on impossible and forget the look of it! I to feel more conscious of the droopy 'old' one rather than the as the hospital call it pert one.  The onco doctor said to me when I first stripped off are you really (in questioning voice) happy with that. Confidence wasn't at its highest leaving hospital that day. The trick of removing one wire from an old bra has worked as a temporary measure. I'm afraid trial and error  (many in my case) seems to be the way forward ",

As I am suffering with anxiety at the mo I am just waiting the results of blood tests to check levels. The doctor was not inclined for me to just take supplements without checking first. So from my experience I'd suggest maybe asking your doctor first before taking just in case. Hope that helps x  ",
