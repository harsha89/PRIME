    "Content": "I've just got up morning after 4th chemo treatment, I haven't felt sick at all and I normally feel terrible the first two days and nights. I also felt no change in the tumour size and got my period back in the last few days. I'm worried this may mean I'm resisting treatment. Has anyone else had anything similar?",
