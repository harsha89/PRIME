      "Content": "Hi I had my first EC last Saturday and used the cold cap. I took 2 paracetamol about 30mins before and have to say there was nothing to it. The first 10mins are the worst they say but to be honest it didn't affect me in the slightest. I felt a bit cold about an hour into it but just asked for another blanket. It maybe different the next time I use it but gonna keep using it.",
