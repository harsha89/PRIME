      "Content": "Hi , WhatHappened and the others on this thread ......some time ago I read a trial / research project on \u201c 4 common and cheap drugs \u201c which can affect breast cancer ,they were a statin , metformin , aspirin and an anti microbial ( not an antibiotic as such but something used for worms ! ) can\u2019t think of its name at the moment .......the point was they were all well understood as regards side effects etc and were easy to stop if necessary.....I was very interested in this , although generally I am not keen on more and more drugs ! Years ago I worked in with cardiovascular patients and also did some teaching and was very sceptical about statins being prescribed so widely on the back of the Farmington study , which lots of people thought had some areas of poor methodology........and in recent years the discussion of statins has gone on and on , but this use ( for cancer ) is a different discussion altogether.......and I still think it is interesting.......these drugs are off patent and cheap , maybe it will turn out to be helpful ? this is , of course ,just my opinion .....hope you have a good day ....x",

It is very hard to take one step at a time , but the experts are dealing with this all the time and will make you a plan , and if ( it is IF ) there has been spread , it does not necessarily mean a bad prognosis ..... you have been given a CT early on , though you do not say how much of you was scanned,they seem to be moving fairly quickly at your hospital . There is a lot to take in , but there are lots of people on here who can explain things , and more importantly listen to your fears ....we \u201c get it \u201c ......best wishes and let us know how you get on .....x",

There was / is also the issue of infection , bites , scratches , thorns , etc etc ......supposed to wear long sleeves and tough gloves , must admit I forget sometimes and so far have got away with it .....

Also I read a lot and I think that Vit D with Calcium might not be \" enough \" if you already have osteoporosis ......to get calcium into bones you need VitK2 , magnesium , boron , possibly zinc.......but please research this for yourself .......Also be aware that few Drs have ever heard of K2 .......but there are lots of posts on this site about it .  Wishing you good luck for the new year ....",

      "Content": "Hi , the whole issue of diet and cancer is a minefield . It is also awful that so many BCN s seem to be overworked and unhelpful. I think they cannot advocate things which are not in NICE guidelines . Personally I doubt anything you do in the very short term is going to affect your cancer drastically . I took the letrazole religiously and ate a good diet and still got secondaries . I think the whole of your treatment plan is more important than one issue . And stressing about it is probably not a good thing for your metabolism of nutrients !?  Fad diets are always hard to maintain . I don\u2019t know if you would consult a nutritionist ?  The only thing I have been told is that asparagus and grapefruit can be oestrogenic , and I ate a lot of grapefruit all my life ( and miss it )  ,and some hospitals seem to telling patients this when they take letrazole , and some don\u2019t. Anyway , you probably put on any excess weight over a long period , so don\u2019t beat yourself up about losing it quickly ......best wishes for everything...x",

The oncologist told me that although a new primary in the breast ,or a local recurrence were possible ,she felt there was a good chance (!) that I would find them ,but a clear mammogram which is reassuring does not screen for \" secondaries \" which is more likely ( in my case )  scary thought ......but medicine is now so research based ,and I suppose they need to do the \" best \" for the \" most \" people with the rescources they have , at the same time as minimising harm .......I just wish there was something accurate they could do without squashing my scarred painful boob ......best wishes to you all",
