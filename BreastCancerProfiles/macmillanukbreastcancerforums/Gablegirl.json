      "Content": "Hi Zap 1/15 on Tuesday 3rd April. Glad that day is finally here but a bit anxious about how I will cope.  Have the treatment time for Tuesday and hoping that I can get appointment times on Wednesday and Thursday that would enable me to get back to Blackpool from Preston by 12:15 before my daughter starts work. She thought that I had said not to book my nearly 10 year old grandson into holiday club this week so I will have to take him with me if not! Breast care nurse rang me last Thursday to say that she had been told that the CT at my planning appointment the previous week had shown a seroma that they wanted her to look at. I knew that there was some swelling in armpit area but had not thought too much of it until she aspirated 200ml out. Hopefully it will not refill too quickly. Best wishes to all that are joining me on this part of the journey and I am sure that we will chat more over the next month.",

Future appointments vary from 09:15 to 17:30 so will get to see the full variation of the flow of traffic.

I was planning on wearing clean trousers and the top that I had worn at another interview 2 days ago as I am limited in top choice by current bras. Just ready to go when I noticed a new stain on the top (stray moisturizer probably) . So I grabbed a dress and then headed off. It was only as I parked that I realised that was not a good choice for radiotherapy particularly as I had my review today as well.  It was a dress with a small button at the back of your neck that goes over your head so was just glad that I was wearing big knickers as I stood there while my breast was examined and then tried to stay decent on the table!",

She asked what was said at my rescanning appointment (leave it alone) and reviewed the area drained last week (it has refilled but no sign of infection).

Although she didn't say it, I would suspect that they are also given if the level of cells seen in the lymph nodes is determined to be too low for clearance but need to be treated. Definitely not related to breast size as I am a E/F cup, which means that I have to wear a bra during treatment to keep them from falling. Slightly off topic but I had my Holistic Needs Assessment (HNA) after my zap this morning and I would definitely recommend that people take up this opportunity. Best wishes x",

I use Aveeno baby but currently just when I remember so will need to get into a routine for treatment. Best wishes x",

I am a mental health nurse and knew that I wasn't going to be ready to go back to the wards but had planned to return to some work with the Single Point of Access team. This is the team that your GP refers you to if they are concerned about your mental health, we carry out an assessment and then signpost you to community groups or refer you on to the relevant mental health team. This means that I could very well have someone in the same position as us sat in front of me and really need to be sure that I am ready for this. I have a bit of time to make a decision so will talk to a workfriend who had cancer in the past about how they coped and have asked to be referred to Occupational Health. Enjoy your me time.",

Tiny red dots had disappeared by the evening on Thursday but reappeared when getting changed before today's session. Still not bothering me so haven't used the steroid cream and radiotherapists say are a normal side effect. In some pain though. Grandchildren stayed overnight on Saturday for first time this year. Granddaughter (nearly 3) would not settle in her bed so bought her in with me. Made sure to keep my arm across my poorly breast to protect from sharp elbows but she suddenly lurched up the bed like a frog and kneed me in it with more force than I ever thought possible. Some form of martial art may be in her future. Think that it has made my seroma bigger and harder so will be glad to get it drained next Tuesday morning.

      "Content": "Dayityrose - I am sorry that you have had such a negative experience of the PIP process and appreciate that this forum is a safe place to rant but it is not like that for everyone. I am sure that you would not want to put someone off applying because they are fearful of the assessment after reading your comments. People have good and bad experiences in all aspects of their health journeys. I have read a number of posts where people have had difficulties with their oncologist and there is a process for complaint, as there is with PIP. I am not saying that I am anything special but most claimants thanked me at the end of the assessment and some went as far as to write letters and cards of thanks to myself and my colleagues. Yes I was employed by the government but I have been for the whole of the 30 years that I have been a registered nurse within the NHS.  With regard to specialist letters, they confirm diagnosis, treatment and symptoms but it is rare that they can give an opinion on a person's day to day functioning. Although I supported some of my past service users continuously for 10 years, I would not have been able to comment on if they needed to sit down to cook, if they held on to anything while getting in the bath and how easy they found it to clean themselves after using the toilet. I definitely don't think that my BCN, oncologist or breast surgeon would know. People often ask why they are called for assessment and I give this example. I opened a questionnaire for a man in his 60s who was moving from DLA to PIP. He had a respiratory condition and his medication suggested that it was severe (no letters provided). When I looked at his activities, he reported only having difficulty with walking distances. This information did not fit as I would have expected impairment in other activities. When I went out to the waiting room he was on oxygen and he needed to stop twice while walking slowly for 18.5m to my room. He was breathless while talking and there were changes to his colour when he took the oxygen off for a short period. Sure enough he was carrying out all the daily activities without the support of others and was very proud of this but each activity took a very long time and it took time to recover. Without a face to face assessment, this gentleman would not have been awarded PIP. PIP is not a perfect process and frankly it would be impossible to devise a system that was given the range of conditions that affect people's physical, mental, cognitive and intellectual health. Therefore I would advise people to be open minded when they apply and have their assessment.",

      "Content": "OK, back home now, fed and watered and ready to give you as much help as I can. So PIP replaced Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for new claimants in 2013. As before it was designed to help those with long term health conditions with the additional costs that they incurred as a result of their health. PIP puts less emphasis on the diagnosis and more on the resultant impairment to function in 10 activities of daily living and 2 related to mobility. This means that 2 people can have the same diagnosis but may not both be eligible. For example I would not be eligible as my tumour was small, surgery was uncomplicated, only a single lymph node was removed and it was clear, I have full range of movement and power in both arms and no significant side effects from my radiotherapy (6/15 sessions in) or my Letrozole so none of my activities are affected. However if I had had a full lymph node clearance or chemotherapy, the situation is likely to be different. Because explaining health conditions on a form is difficult, most people will have a face to face assessment with a health professional so that questions can be asked as people underestimate their needs as well as overestimate. They will be a nurse (general, mental health, learning disability), an Occupational Therapist (OT) or a paramedic and will then have undergone additional training as a disability analyst and I can tell you that this training is extensive. When the appointments are arranged you will be offered the next available appointment at any PIP Consultation Centre within 90 minutes of your postcode. If it is not convenient, ring the number and ask for a closer one. The addresses of all centres are online. When you arrive the receptionist will ask for ID and ask you to take a seat. They then let an assessor know that you have arrived. Different centres have different ways of working depending on things like size but in most cases this will be when the assessor will look at your questionnaire and any evidence that you may have sent. Not all claimants turn up and it would breach confidentiality to have access to this information if not carrying out the assessment. Therefore you could be waiting for around 20 minutes. The assessment room will have a desk, some chairs and an examination couch. If breast cancer is your only health condition then I can think of no reason why you should be asked to get on the couch. However if you have said on your questionnaire that node clearance has reduced your ability to raise your arm to wash your hair, I would expect you to be taken through a range of arm movements on both sides either sitting or standing and for any reduction in power to be assessed by being asked to push up and down with forearm against assessors hand.  The assessor will take you through the activities like the questionnaire but in more depth to determine if you can complete them safely, to an acceptable standard, in a timely manner and repeatedly and if this is independently, with aids/adaptations, with prompting, with supervision, with assistance or not at all. You don't need to be currently using that level of support, just need it. With B.C. both the physical and psychological effects should be considered i.e. someone having chemo is likely to lack the motivation to prepare and cook a simple meal from fresh ingredients (prompting) but the level of fatigue could be high enough that they would need assistance to complete the activity and this will score higher. However if the impairment is due to reduced power in an arm following lymph clearance then the likely scoring would be for aids. Each activity is scored separately and it is very rare for someone to score in all activities i.e. B.C. would not be expected to affect your ability to speak, read, make budgeting decisions or plan and follow a journey. However fatigue, loss of appetite, anxiety about change of appearance and changes to power and movement in an arm may affect the other activities. Variability is also a key area. For how many days after chemo are things worse etc? You will also be asked questions about things like your home (how do you manage stairs, have there been any changes made due to your health etc), how did you get to the centre (are you driving, is car adapted, how do you manage with door, seat belt etc, did someone come with you on bus), have you needed to give up hobbies and about work. You can work and get PIP but they want to know about any reasonable adjustments made. These areas are not scored but give a personal rounded picture. Finally you will be asked factual questions about your treatment and side effects and which specialists you see and how often etc. If any examination of movement and power is needed this will then occur. This is with your clothes on (you can take your coat/cardie off if you want). Once you leave the assessor will finish their report and it goes off electronically. All assessors are subject to random audit so may be slightly delayed but decision letters should take 4-6 weeks. Most symptoms of BC would be expected to reduce over time so expect to be awarded for no more than a year before review. Please do not exaggerate and the right evidence that supports your account of functional impairment is more valuable than lots of evidence or evidence that is generic like a leaflet about radiotherapy. Sorry this has been such a long post but I hope that it has been helpful. I know that some people will have had less than desirable experiences of this process but there are positive experiences to be had. In case anyone is wondering, I left for reasons outside the job.",

      "Content": "Hi I would agree that a year before is excessive but claimants should expect to receive review forms a few months before the end of the award and there are two reasons that I can think of for that.  Firstly so that there is not a gap in payments during the process. There needs to be time for you to gather any new evidence and complete the form, this to be reviewed to determine if a face to face assessment is needed or if a decision can be made on available evidence or after gathering phone evidence, time for face to face appointment to occur, possible audit of assessors report and then for DWP decision maker to make their decision. Secondly that award periods are set based on when it would be \"medically reasonable\" for a change in the level of functional impairment to be seen but we are all individuals. For some cases an improvement would be expected due to physical recovery, treatment, therapy and the psychological process of adaptation and this could occur earlier than expected. Which as a nurse, I see as a good thing. However it is also possible to underestimate the speed of progression of degenerative conditions.",

      "Content": "Capita have the PIP contract in the Midlands and Wales. Scotland and the rest of England are covered by Independent Assessment Services (formally ATOS Healthcare). However a face to face assessment may be carried out by a health professional from a Supply Chain Provider (a bit like a sub contractor). This could be a small private company or an NHS Trust so could be at a medical centre or hospital. The majority of claimants will be asked to attend a centre as this is the most efficient way of assessing people quickly so that awards can be made as up to 5 assessments per assessor can occur daily opposed to 3 for home assessors. It is also safer for the assessors as some people's health conditions can lead to violence.  Home assessments will definitely be given to people who are undergoing chemotherapy, have severe agoraphobia, have home visits or phone consultations from their GP rather than attend the surgery, complex health needs or live more than 90 minutes from a consultation centre like the Highlands of Scotland. They definitely will not be given if any of the evidence shows that it would not be safe for an assessor to go to the home. If people are regularly attending outpatient appointments, which may be further away than the assessment, then they are less likely to be granted one.",

      "Content": "Hi Before surgery my surgeon told me that I couldn't drive until I saw him 2 weeks afterwards. When my BCN rang me with my results 8 days post op I asked her and she said that I could legally drive 48 hours after surgery and they gave 2 weeks as a guide but it was really up to the individual. I started driving the next day and have had no problems.",
