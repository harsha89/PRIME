      "Content": "Hi, I am just about at the decision point as well, so this discussion is useful. I have an appointment on Tuesday which I think (!) is with the oncologist (the hospital appointment letters tell you nothing apart from a name). My lump was 24mm, stage 2, no lymph node spread, HER negative and OR positive. I've had three wide area incisions as they weren't able to get clear margins on the first two attempts (results of the third op awaited, probably get that on Tuesday as well). At 50, I feel I'm on the cusp in terms of 'do I, don't I' so will see I what the prediction tool says. I've been scared stiff of needing chemo given all the horror stories, but I accept that many, many women opt for it and get through it, and I can understand the desire to chuck everything at this thing. Good luck Sarah, and thanks to everyone else for sharing their thoughts. It really does help those of us behind you on this difficult path!",

      "Content": "Hi Murphy, my initial wide local incision was my first surgery as well, so I was quite anxious, but the hospital staff were very supportive, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be and I didn't have much if any pain or restricted movement afterwards. I've since had two re-incisions as they didn't get clear margins (am awaiting the results of the latest one and whether chemo is needed :-s). Again, no pain after these and no problem with arm movement, My hospital provided me with a sick note before I was discharged; he first and second time it was for 2 weeks but last time it was just for 1 and I went back to work a day earlier anyway (and was working from home whilst signed off anyway to keep the flood of emails at bay!) So, yes, it will depend on how you feel and whether you're up to it. My work is also predominantly computer/office based as well; just make sure you take things at your pace. I have certainly felt more tired over recent weeks but probably mainly due to the emotional stress of it all and, as others have said, you are likely to have good and bad days so listen to your body. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi there. I was in a similar situation. Initially it all sounded quite routine; a quick local incision, then radiotherapy. Job done. My results from the first op weren't good as they weren't able to get a clear margin, so I went for WLE number 2. Again, one of the margins wasn't clear. So then there was mention of mastectomy and chemo, which was very scary. I opted for a third (and final) WLE (3rd one in 2 months) and was extremely anxious waiting for the results - much worse than for the others, although I was lucky not to have any significant pain from any of the ops. Last week these came through as clear, and a test of the original lump indicates little benefit of chemo (although I will be talking to the oncologist to get more detail on this) so back to plan A re: radiotherapy. I say all this to illustrate how each of our journeys is different and difficult. I have just tried to take one step at a time and not think too any steps ahead, which I know is extremely easy to say and much harder to do! I'm now waiting for my referral to an oncologist at another hospital, so fingers crossed the original plan is still the right one. All the best for your results and next steps, and glad to hear that you have some strong support from friends and family. Loveday",
