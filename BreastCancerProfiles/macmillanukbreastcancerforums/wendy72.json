      "Content": "Hi All, I underwent a Mastectomy and reconstruction just over a week ago.  We had the results from the pathology report last Tuesday but unfortunately the surgeon did not agree with the conclusion reached by the pathologist and so my case has to be rediscussed - we will hear further in another two weeks.  Basically I was diagnosed with 6 cm DCIS.  There was also an invasive component of ICS under 1 cm.  I was ER and PR negative.  The pathologist graded the tumour as stage 3, however, the surgeon feels that it should only be stage 1 as only the invasive component should be included in the grading and subsequent treatment options.  According to the surgeon if it is stage 1 then I don't need chemo or radiation, they got the cancer and I won't see him again for 6 months.  If the panel discussing the case agree on stage 3 then I will need chemo and / or radiation.  As you can imagine its a bit frustrating.  I'm inclined to go with the surgeons assessment as generally with stage 3 the tumour is over 5 cm or so.... however, I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the above and also if anyone has had treatment which just stopped with the mastectomy.   I'd rather not get chemo but am scared of the cancer coming back.  Thank you. :o)",

      "Content": "Hi fivejays, I hope your partner is doing well after her op and not too sore.  I can imagine that you are counting down the days until you get the pathology report.  I also recently had a mastectomy and reconstruction, the invasive component was not so large but I did have a large amount of dcis which meant the whole breast had to go.  Its a relief to have it gone, I would imagine it is the same for you and your partner.  Just the waiting game now.  It sounds like your partner is a very strong lady and I will keep my fingers crossed for you both. ",

Hang in there and wishing you all the best.",
