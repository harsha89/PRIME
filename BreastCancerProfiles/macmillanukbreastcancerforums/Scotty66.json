      "Content": "I was given a choice of places at pre chemo meeting. In my area the cost of a synthetic wig is fully covered by NHS voucher. I went to my lovely hairdresser last night so he could trim my wig to make it feel a bit more like me. What he did recommend to get rid of the shininess and to create more texture was to use something called dry shampoo. I'd never heard of it but you can get it for about £1.50 at Superdrug. He used some as he was styling it last night and it did make a difference. As for washing it, he said fabric conditioner and baby shampoo work just as well!",
