      "Content": "Hi 232pookie Not sure if you have been taking note of the BRANDS of Letrozole you have been taking.  The different brands can give worse or minimal side effects!  It could just be an accumulation of this drug in the system.  For Anastrozole I only had hot flushes but watched which brand I got even to the point of making my GP ensure that only a certain brand was prescribed on my repeat prescriptions.  Having said that I note on some of the discussions that getting a particular brand which has less side effects for them is becoming difficult to source for pharmacists!  Don't know why that is.  Both these drugs work in the same way to suppress ER/PR pathways.  Letrozole didn't work for me, by the way.  Not on any of these endocrine tablets at the moment but may be again in the future. Hopefully more ladies will come back with what they have experienced.",

In reading your levels they don't actually correspond with my levels above on these enzymes so your level must be for another enzyme which I can't help you with. All the other enzyme levels from my original blood test don't match the normal levels you quote (asked for a copy of the blood test results from my GP and received it.   Would be very interested to know what this particular blood test was - if you can find out.

All of my supplements in one tablet.... - I'd have to have a mouth as big as an elephant!!!  Used to take pro-biotics but stopped that.  As mistymoley says in her bit PRE-biotics (which I have only just learnt about from a TV programme 'Food Unwrapped' on Channel 4 broadcast on Mondays 8.30pm) looks a better way to help your gut flora. No dairy.  I do occasionally treat myself to some cheese.   Recommend dark chocolate all the way.  Less milk but only have 2 squares when you do.  No meat except for fish and chicken but again occasionally treat myself to lamb.  Supposedly this is the lesser peril of all the red meats.  Water has been filtered for years although now I use bottled (unfortunately plastic bottled) for drinking the green tea as my water supply even when using a filter receptacle tastes tainted when boiled. Microwaves heat/cook out all the good nutrients from food so always use the cooker.  When cooking veg I use my steamer and like them al dente - even the sprouts!  You can have potatoes.  I class them as a veg and give you the necessary carbs for good health.  Cook as normal (soft) - or have a baked potato and eat the skin - good nutrients here.  Basically, eat a rainbow diet (and there's a book called it) and bring into your diet a varied range of food and herbs.  The rainbow diet also tells you the benefits and nutrients you will get from each food.  A nutrition workshop I attended asked each person to write down what they eat in a day and I did this after got home.  The lady speaker said that most people would have cereal with milk for breakfast, sandwich for lunch, eg bread and cheese, which already meant that people had eaten two meals with only wheat and dairy therein.  She said that in her estimation people only ate 10 different things a day.  When I did my survey for that day in September 2014 I found that with all my supplements I had taken 53 different items!  Heaven knows how many individual beneficial nutrients that would have meant!

Having said that my cancer was found through screening BUT crucially it was not palpable even though the size was eventually confirmed as 13x7x21mm.  I hadn't clue I had it at all.  AND I am like the 5 men in the bit afterwards on prostate cancer who have elected NOT to have aggressive treatment of surgery (which, it seems, can leave them incontinent and impotent) and use a watch and wait approach.  I believe that I have DEFINITELY taken the right approach.   Science is advancing our knowledge of cancer and I think it is important that people, not least of whom are women diagnosed with breast cancer, that they are fully informed of options and not pressurised by well meaning doctors and family to undertake aggressive treatment.  I do as always back any women's decision to follow any course of treatment they decide on.  That is THEIR  right - NO-ONE ELSES.

      "Content": "Hi FreyaO Thanks for the heads up Carolyn28.  Just a quick look around the internet and came across some studies as well as the websites promoting PEMF for injuries that athletes suffer in their different sports.  Seems this has been around for donkeys years.  Unsure of the person who quoted the potential harm if a person has had cancer of it causing more tumours.  PEMF also acts on the macrophages in cells to get them working on your behalf.  It's a lack of electrical activity in these macrophages, very important to the efficient running of a cell, that causes health problems.  PEMF electrical stimulus is akin to the pulse of our planet earth.  Some people go and 'earth' themselves, ie, walk around on the grass!  That's the level of the PEMF impulses that are given.  Can that be bad?   No, I don't think so. I had sono photodynamic therapy.  The sono in this treatment was the sono machine that is used to blast kidney stones to pieces but was used for my tumours in my right boob.  Oxygenated blood is circulated around the body every 1 minute.  My first RGCC blood test came back with a reading of 4.0 for circulating tumour cells.  The next one 5 months later came back with a reading of 2.5.  Therefore, some 'stimuli' can be advantageous for various things. Gotta admit that I haven't been walking on grass in my bare feet since I was a little kid.  Maybe this is why I got cancer - I am not in tune with our earth!  Sounds absolutely stupid and wacky, yes, I know, but it's got me thinking...... The medics, for once, seem to have got it right for your stress fracture.  As they are advocating it I would take them up on it without any quibble. You have gotta come back to us on how you do if you take this up. Love and hugs at this difficult decision making time.",

      "Content": "Hi  Cal57 Arimidex is the original with Anastrozole the generic equivalent (works in exactly the same way - so we are told).  Arimidex is more expensive since it is the original.  I take Anastrozole but have insisted with my GP that I take the Teva brand.  I was put on the Accord brand and found that I started to have aches and pains around my thumb and wrists within 5 days.  Now back on the Teva brand that side effect has gone.  The only other side effect I suffer are the hot flushes which I am dealing with.  Arimidex comes with its own side effects of which you know and possibly are dealing with.  It may be that your GP wants to try the generic equivalent which would be cheaper for the practice.  If however the side effects are decidedly worse for you on that brand you can try others like Teva, Accord etc.  Suggest you get only 1 month's supply at a time to see how it works out.  If in the end of trying all the other brands Arimidex is the best one for you then insist with the GP that your quality of life is affected seriously with the generics and you need to go back on Arimidex.  I read on another website that hypromellose, which is in the Actavis brand, can cause some of the side effects.  It seems that it is these 'fillers' that cause the side effects!

Or am I just too naïve to understand the ramifications of surgery!  Not having had surgery I cant say how long you COULD have pain afterwards but had I been in pain as you have described, for as long as you describe, then I would have been shouting the hospital's walls down and the GP's for proper management or at the very least an investigation.  Unfortunately your pain is in the way of any of that - mamm's will squash, MRI's will pull as your boob/s dangles and US will need contact at the least.  Sheesh, talk about being between a rock and a hard stone!  No pun intended. I fractured my little finger and it only took 5 WEEKS to heal.  Our bodies are designed to heal so I really don't understand why you haven't healed and are in so much pain. It could be inflammation and Snowys Mum has given you a couple of things to take.  I like jowoomot's take of going to a hospice who can look at your pain management in a more effective way but I still harbour thoughts that EVERYTHING should be checked out first in your boobs.

      "Content": "Hi All Interested in this discussion due to the rash.  I am just about getting over the flu.  Put my clothes on yesterday as I mentally wanted to feel on the mend but I haven't been feeling well enough to cope with having a shower during this time.  By the evening I had severe itching on inside of my arms from my sweatshirt type jacket top.   When I took it off and looked, sure enough, there on the inside were the tell tale signs of either my concentrated liquid detergent or could it be my softener in those areas from not having been properly rinsed out in the washing machine.  Crucially I had already made the decision NOT to put softener on my whites which include my underwear and as I DON'T have any itching around those sensitive areas I can only assume that the softener is the culprit.  Obviously there was a build up of this chemical on my skin and my skin suffered as a result. Today I did have a shower and my arms are much, much, better.  I have a little redness and it is slightly 'knobbly' but not itching any more.  Hopefully by tomorrow it will completely resolve itself. Learning Factor - no more liquid softener for me!  Build up of these 'safe' liquids on your skin can cause skin rashes!  Was given an organic 'pack' to clean house - will look into this a bit deeper and start using this to clean my clothes.  Another unnecessary toxin in my life consigned to the bin.  I thought I was fine with these but obviously not. So, my suggestion to everyone is - look at some of the things that, ultimately, end up next to your skin! .... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

Make sure you advise the radiographers that you are still tender and you have no intention of putting up with anything that hurts.  If it does hurt SAY SO.  If they don't respond SCREAM BLUE MURDER.  That way there will be no denying that they are actually hurting you and it lets everyone outside know just how insensitive they are being.  They also have a foot peddle which releases you so ensure that this is in play at the time.  They also have a small wheel, to the left of the 'plate' which they sometimes 'tweak' to make it a little tighter on the boob - you can turn this to have less pressure - I think it turns down to tighten and up to lessen but LET THEM KNOW. I am having a mamm after 3 years in July - I will definitely be getting them to play my game, not theirs. All the best for tomorrow",

When I find I can't sleep it's because I'm not relaxed.  This manifests itself through a clamped jaw and even though my eyes are shut I find that I am looking up behind the lids.  I get 'my head' into a relaxing approach by sleeping on my side (which could be a problem post operatively) and concentrating on relaxing my jaw and making my mouth natural but lips together and making sure my eyes are looking downwards.  I sometimes do end up having to turn over but repeat the process and before I know it I am waking up with the alarm.  Concentrating on the relaxing will take your mind off what other things WILL be going through your head at the time.  It's this that is keeping you awake. 7 hours in 3 days is not good.  You know you need your sleep to help your body recover so the sooner you get a handle on this the better.

When I did have gastro problems I took Asilone but now have in readiness 'cos I do sometimes go 'silly' Pepto Bismol - its pink.  Seems to work just as well as the Asilone.  No Rennies as they can rot the teeth over time.

Can you advise if Mum's cancer is hormone fuelled?  If so then she can start using the endocrine therapy instead.  This will be much less harsh on the body but does come with its own side effects.  Mine are just hot flushes which can be dealt with quite easily.  Aches and pains in limbs and joints are another but luckily I don't get these. I'm hoping that you go with your Mum to her appointments with the consultant or oncology - not necessarily to her chemo appointments though I am sure you do.  Arm yourself with a lot of questions and get answers.  Alternatively you can surf the net and I am sure there will be lots of help given from our community champions.

Don't be rushed into doing things by the medics.  I would have thought that a wonderful holiday with your kids BEFORE any further treatment would be a godsend.  You will be revitalised and hold in your heart the fun memories of that time - especially as your daughters have been looking forward to this holiday.

      "Content": "Hi Tingk Think you need to have a REAL, IN DEPTH discussion with your surgeon.  It is one of the main questions I have about surgery after complete pathological response to chemotherapy.  The fact that they don't know where the original tumour is is not a good enough excuse for a mastectomy.  All this means is that the nuclear medicine would not be able to find the original site without the marker as a guide or your tumour.  It could most certainly be mapped from the mamm and ultrasounds that have been done (I assume that they have been done) but the doctor/surgeon is just not willing to do this for your minor tissue conservation surgery.  I think that a 'step' in procedures was not carried out also so I would question the doctor/surgeon on this. Alternatively, you could use the wait and see approach.  You don't have to take any treatment further unless you are confident in the answers you are getting and trust in the team to go forward.  Only you can decide that after you have been given all the facts.  You do have to be strong and assertive and not just take any old crap that doctors give out.  As far as you are concerned to them, and in my case it is exactly as I relate, you are just a patient listening to the 'god given word' of the medic - I think not! If you have anyone by your side in all this get them to help you build a list of questions you need answers for and make sure they accompany you.  There is nothing more disconcerting to them to have a patient who always has someone with them who can jump in to ask other questions in response to things that crop up.  It is at these most trying times that someone by your side fighting in your corner is the best possible way forward.  Make sure that they are fully conversant with your diagnosis.

I am on chemo but boob is developing lesions on or under the skin which show.  One is quite big and very red but my medics just seem to want to deal with a lesion in the liver by more and more scans.  I am more worried about what I can see!.  Have a Radiotherapy/Oncologist appt on Wednesday to get the low down on this for those lesions.  Will know more if radiotherapy would potentially be used for rest of the breast as well.  Would prefer another treatment but being given the run around on this.  A dedicated Breast MRI being done on 19 November will see if the chemo I am on - EC-Paclitaxol (3rd cycle of EC just undertaken with one more to go in 2 weeks time then 4 Paclitaxel every 2 weeks) has done any work in knocking the tumours into submission.  BUT everything depends on the results of the Breast MRI.  I have my next consult for that on 21 November.

It DOES seem that it IS the fillers in these generic AIs that cause the side effects.  Finding a brand which gives you less of the side effects is the key.  Try the TEVA brand first for a month and see how it goes.  If that fails then you can discuss the option of Arimidex (more expensive I understand).  A friend of mine was put on Letrozole and had really bad side effects and consequently stopped taking them.  She was however already suffering from arthritis so the AI only made it worse.  From discussions on here I understand that Tamoxifen is worse. I am finding that doctors/consultants don't understand the impact that these side effects have on our daily lives.  Be a b....y minded old cuss and work with your GP to find a brand AI that works best for YOU.  When you go back and see the consultant (time permitting) YOU can tell HIM that YOU have sorted this out !!! .... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

I also told this to a friend of mine with painful knees and joints. She was given a 'goodly' supply of bottled water and I told her to drink this rather than tap water.  Seems that after only one week her mobility is much improved.  I suggested we give it a month and see how she is at the end of that time. Can't harm you to try this.  Additionally, I keep my water in the fridge so that you have access to a nice cool glass of water!  So buy one that can fit in your fridge.  Any bottled water in plastic should be kept in a dry, dark place to prevent the sun affecting the plastic and leaching into the water.  Alternatively you can buy glass bottles of water but this could be costly.

You can get referred to another doctor for breast care should you so choose.  All that's needed is a referral from the existing team and should not be a problem.  If it is then just make a complaint again.  Sometimes we just need to give them a nudge that they are not coming up to standard and have wholeheartedly not  kept their eye on the ball in your case.

      "Content": "Hi tropicof In some ways this diagnosis is MAKING us look at the treatments the team want you to take and whether you can actually cope with them.  In taking responsibility/control you are then in a position to help yourself.  It pays to use your voice. You say your diet is not good to say the least.  You are what you eat.  In fact if your digestive tract is out of order then your health is out of order.  Just taking control of this one thing can do wonders for the psyche - and your figure.  Dairy, in the end, is a bad thing.  You can get the requisite calcium as a supplement or as part of the endocrine therapy which also contains Vit. D3 - very important.  It is said that all Europeans don't have enough Vit. D for our bodies to work properly.  I also supplement and take 2 x 4,000 iU's a day.  If you have cancer then 10,000 is better. Most of your diet should be vegetables and fruit.  Lots of people talk about the sugar in fruit but this is natural and for thousands of years humans have eaten fruit.  No junk food.  No convenience foods.  You don't have to eat meat every day just the vegetables will do the trick.  One lady I know just cut bread from her diet and has lost 4 stone.  Says something about our bread today! I am on the endocrine therapy - and only that.  I never went for surgery or the radiation which was my treatment.  My write-up under my name will give you my short story as well as the extremely long discussion I started back in October 2012 -' To have the op or try alternative'.  Had the Anastrozole first with no problems but the docs felt it had stopped working when the tumour started to grow again so put onto Letrozole.  My mamm and ultrasound tomorrow (2nd August) with a consult on the 17th will give answers on the effectiveness of the Letrozole.  I have had no problems with either of the tablets and just wonder if it isn't the amount of supplements I take, change in diet, change in lifestyle, etc, etc, which has gone a long way to stopping potential side-effects and I think a healthier me although I have just had a small stroke which has affected the sight in my right eye.  Had a complete 'white-out' in the right eye but the body's healing system is working to correct the problem and some sight has come back and is slowly, but surely, starting to come back every day.  This was down to high blood pressure for which I am now on tablets and of course for the cholesterol - my diet had slipped somewhat.  Nothing like a kick in the arse to get back on track! So for the endocrine therapy, this is something that you could try and if, worse comes to worse, you find you cannot tolerate the side-effects then you can stop.  Some ladies here have put quality of life over quantity.  I can only report that I am okay with it.  Different brands seem to have worse side-effects.  The originals are Arimidex (Anastrozole) or Femara (Letrozole) if you do suffer bad side-effects from the generics - Anastrozole or Letrozole.  I think they would want to try the generics first though.  Unsure why they want to give you a jab every six months as I take Calcichew (Calcium with Vit. D3)! See if you can't find a Breast Cancer support group.  I found 2 in my area.  Just somewhere to talk with other ladies who have been there, done that and know where you are coming from.

      "Content": "Hi Vonnie1 Saw your discussion yesterday and have just finished reading the report.  I \u2018think\u2019 I signed the petition but just can\u2019t remember \u2013 such is the power of being diagnosed with BC. When I first heard about the increase in the pension age I put my date into the computer on the Government's pension page and it came back as 66 years and 4 months.  It is now 65 years 9 months and 3 days - my birth date being 3 August 1954.  From what I can gather the WASPI petition is trying to amend the transitional dates so that women born in the 50's should not bear the brunt of the cost of this transition.  It could turn out that my official retirement date could change again! I also found a pdf file on the web showing your retirement dates based on the day you were born and it seems that the basic retirement age has increased to 67 years.  I do remember the 1995 'Act' reducing women's retirement age to 60 but since I was far away from it I never really bothered.  As a staunch equality person I couldn\u2019t fathom out why this had been implemented. I just didn\u2019t understand how a man still had to retire on a state pension at 65 while women were retiring at 60!! A friend of mine born on 1 April 1950 was able to retire at 60 but my birth of 1 August 1954 - just 4 years younger - means that I have to work 5 years 9 months and 3 days longer!!!!!  I also noted that some of the speakers in the debate talked about the health problems that women seem to have in later years as well as the many inequalities throughout their working lives that we have had to put up with which will leave us in poor financial predicaments in retirement.  At one point I wondered where this £155.65 pension per week was coming from until I again looked it up on the Government's website.  At this actual moment in time it is £115.95 so the new pension will give - on average - another £40 per week - but will this be enough to live on!  This will come in on 5 April 2016 and will be the same for every pensioner whether male or female (I was actually beginning to think I would be victimised because I was a woman by only receiving a lower pension despite the fact that I have paid into the system for 41 years) as I did ask last year for a forecast from the Government on expected pension for when I DO retire and they came back with £141.50 - I think - but again the goalposts seem to constantly change.  How on earth are we expected to follow all this to'ing and fro'ing!!! So thanks for this Vonnie1. I will definitely keep my eye on this and as I do actually know one of the speakers, Ruth Cadbury MP, from the debate I will be sure to ask her for updates on this. \u2026.still fighting this nasty little critter\u2026",

D3 tablets a day along with what you can get from your food and 1 tablet of Magnesium a day - all supplements from health food store.  Also recommended for absorption is Vit. K.  However as I also take Chlorella and Spirulina I get my Vit. K from those supplements. I was originally on Anastrozole for 4+ years until, it seemed, from a check up with my oncologist and the ultrasound, that my cancer had grown 1mm all round, ie. from original size down to 5x7mm then up to 6x8mm and the ultrasound followed by biopsy said that a lymph node was now involved when previously it wasn't!  I had no problems with the Anastrozole except the hot flushes.   I am now on Letrozole and from stories on this site I had the inclination that the side effects would be worse.  No, not a bit of it - just the same as Anastrozole. You can surf the net for things to supplement that can help you with the side effects but this is a good start.  Getting rid of dairy, convenience foods (cans, pre-packaged stuff, etc), wheat, white rice, pasta, will also help you.  It is a lifestyle change, yes, but will do you no end of good.  Check your personal hygiene products for toxins and parabens and find better ones, ie deodorants contain aluminium - a toxin - as do shampoos, soaps, etc.  Check labels.  I use Bionsen or Missy.

But back to my sisters - after a lot of negativity from them I told them straight that all I wanted was for them to be there for me, to be my buddy, and not be judgemental - I cannot have them upsetting my mental balance.  I wrote a 7-page 'letter' explaining myself (which I really shouldn't have had to do), my research, my conclusion giving ultimately the reasons for my decision.  From that point on they have been absolute treasures and how I love them dearly. I suppose you could say I too had a few rants but am now in a calm'ish state and trundling along just fine.  The conclusion to me is that having a rant is extremely cathartic so go ahead girl and have as many as you like!

Have now got copies of all the scans and records just so I can see what is being recorded.  Have read them but need to analyse them.  Still thinking about and researching all the other therapies around.  Give the Anastrozole a little longer.  My next appointment with the consultant is 9 January 2014.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.

      "Content": "Hi ladies Many thanks for all the comments.  I hadn't realised so many had been posted. On the case of the new microcalcifications I found a study which puts the possibility of 25% chance of them being pre-cancerous, as opposed to the 20% I have recorded in the blog if not linked to a tumour.  It also said that there is a 90%+ chance of microcalcifications being present when a person has DCIS.  I yet have to research more studies which may confirm or further increase the possibility of the microcalcifications being pre-cancerous.  I was diagnosed at a time when so many horror stories had been published in the papers.  I just could not submit myself to the slash or slice (surgery) and burn (radiotherapy) treatment offered.  There are other treatments out there but just not on the NHS.  Having said that there is a photodynamic trial (I have mentioned this treatment before) and it is with the Royal Free and the link below is encouraging to say the least!  I just would not agree to the mastectomy bit. (see the link below) http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2439464/Photodynamic-laser-treatment-kill-breast-cancer-15-minutes.html To Purple Fox and PatricaB I would just say that you have every right to your opinion.  However don\u2019t be so entrenched - the article in the link above says it all.  My research has shown that people could get up to 6 cancers in their lifetimes but the body uses its immune system to kill these off so enhancing your immune system is crucial.  It\u2019s your body (immune system), after all, that gets you well after the surgery, chemo and radio therapies.  Other up and coming treatments are Immunepheresis and HIFU, not forgetting Thermal Ablation and Cryo Ablation. Another thought being floated is that as you have a tumour in situ it sends out \u2018messages\u2019 around the body to inhibit or stop other tumour growth.  Yes, Yes, I know, there are a lot of ladies out there with metasteses but WERE they there before the surgery or have they developed after the surgery and treatments and before the endocrine therapy!  The endocrine (and chemo) treats the whole body so would search out ALL tumours.  My perspective is that everyone should be offered one of these to reduce the need for a mastectomy. In my case, I would have had a lumpectomy in October 2012 and when returning after surgery for checks they would have found the new microcalcifications (or were they there already) and I would have had to have more surgery possibly even a mastectomy as now quoted!  Two surgeries instead of one!  Having said that would the first operation have cut out the new microcalcifications!  I have been told that the excised tissue from lumpectomies are sent to the lab, during the op, to determine if there are clear margins so that they can cut out extra tissue if necessary.  Would I then wake up to be told that I would have to have another op, possibly, for a mastectomy as they could not get clear margins!  I would not have given my consent for a mastectomy beforehand, and in any case, they would not have gone any further with the surgery without my consent. My known microcalcifications on my right boob are at 7-9 o\u2019clock, tumour at 9 and the new microcalcifications are at 10-11.  Quite a lumpectomy if all taken out.   Definitely left mis-shapen. My recounting of my case is mainly for my benefit and is not a guide to any other lady out there to follow my lead.  However if my stance has peaked your interest in asking lots of questions, not least of the multi-disciplinary team\u2019s choices of treatment for you, then I have gone, also, some way to empowering you to seek the right treatment for you. I\u2019ll be back when I have more to say.  In the meantime love to everyone having to deal with this nasty little critter....",

      "Content": "Hi Girls Many thanks for all your comments - I know I'm controversial!!!!!! Hope you do read through the thread as you will see that the tumour was, at the start, 13 x 7 x 21mm.  At the last count it was 5 x 5 x 7mm with the endocrine therapy plus major lifestyle changes.  You will also see that with the microcalcifications  they wanted to take out 6cm of tissue.  That I could not do.  After that they found another area of microcalcifications so then a mastectomy was the next thinking BUT that set of microcalcifications only came to light a year later!!!!!  (It could be supposed that these were either missed or they have 'appeared' during the intervening time.)   Add to this the trial at the Royal Free on Photodynamics, which in its first phase has a catch 22 - they lop off the boob after 48 hours, there has been a good success rate! (and I say that carefully as they have only had 4 very courageous ladies at the last count who have undergone the trial on which to base this evidence).  My sister died at the age of 34 years of cervical cancer some 32 years ago.  You can be very sure I am fully aware of the consequences of no action as she also did not want surgery. Logic says to cut it out but the idea of the word \"do'able\" constantly bandied about when undertaking surgery and radiotherapy, in my case, afterwards IS JUST NOT ON!!!.  I am appalled that we still see surgery as the only route forward - THAT'S MY OPINION.  Trials on Photodynamics and HIFU are taking place in the UK, Immunepheresis in America, and Thermal Ablation and Cryo Ablation in Europe.  Yes, all are in the trial stage but basically non-invasive and could be used as many times as is necessary WITHOUT the pain, suffering, stress or mutilation. Now I'm no beauty queen - well not at this age anyway, 59,  (nor at any age really!!!!! chuckle chuckle) - but I would like to feel as whole as I can for as long as I can.  I will have to live with the decision as you all have done or are going to do.  I want to see what I can do first with the help of the endocrine therapy.  If anyone is interested a film \"Living Proof\" tells the story of Dr Dennis Slamon and the 12 years it took to get the endocrine therapy through the trials.  In that time, just in America, 480,000 women died waiting for this to help them live longer or even survive......

      "Content": "Hi Ladies Still awaiting the reports on the mamm I had done on 8 May and all the other documents from 4 October but I have received my pictures of the US and mamm.  I have to say that they show a marked improvement in the clearing of the calcifications.  It has however shown up the microcalcifications more.  As they were hidden by the calcifications I cannot say if they too have reduced.  Overall though I think I am doing really well!! Showed the printed pictures to my sister who also saw the improvement.  People I have spoken to also believe that a positive state of mind is really helpful in fighting cancer.  One friend advised of another friend of hers who had gone down the surgery chemo and rad route and was really suffering.  My heart goes really out to her.  Was so pleased to be told on the 8th May that the 12mm referred to the admix of calcifications with microcalcifications and not the tumour growing.  Next appointment is in November 2014 so, for the moment, just awaiting the copies of the written reports and will report when I get them.

      "Content": "Hi Ladies Had my consultation on Thursday, 13 November.  Consultant on holiday so had one of the registrars who just happened to be heavily pregnant.  She asked if I was willing to change my mind about surgery and told her a definite NO.  Told them about the raised Alkaline phosphatase level and they advised that my GP had not sent them anything.  In the interim my GP practice had rung me to make another appointment early December for a blood test again!  Happy with this. However on top of that the registrar wanted me to have more tests as a result of the above and after giving them a copy of my thermogram.  I am now to have a mamm on the left breast just to check out the red line there on 21 November (I do have a very visibly seen vein there UNDER the skin), a CT scan with contrast (iodine based) to check out the liver on 24 November and another CT scan with an injection of radionuclide to check out my bones on 21 November (awaiting the appointment letter as a few checks have to be done first).  Advised them that I had an osteophyte on my L5S1 (lumbar).  Be very interesting to see what they turn up!  Will order copies of all the results before I leave on 24 November.  I then have another consultation booked for 18 December with the consultant/oncologist.  Phewwwww.  Will update you after the 18 December. ... still fighting this nasty little critter.....",

      "Content": "Hi Hairworries Nice to hear from you and I am very pleased to see someone else who, in some ways, is taking a semi-different route to the BC treatment.  As your BC was aggressive it may very well be that choosing to have surgery was the right thing.  Chemo, they say, only gives you a small percentage increase in survival times - so I've read - as does radiation therapy but oh does it leaving you like crap - or so I've read! I had my mamm on Friday and got a look at the pictures.  Can't say that it looked any different from the last one I had in August 2012 - so no BC!.  However once I order the pictures later on I will put the two together to check on any differences.  Today, I am having the CT scan of my abdomen (liver) at 2.30pm with the infusion of iodine - takes about 10 minutes. Will try to see if I could get a sneak peek of these too.  2 December, 11am, is when I am having the Bone scan.   Reading the literature it says the radionuclide will be injected at that time.  I can go away for 3-4 hours drinking at least 2 litres of water to flush to the stuff out BUT it also says that anyone with me I cant sit with them BUT I can go out into the public domain!!!!!!  This will take up to 45 minutes. Then on 18 December I have a consultation and will get the results from the team. On 99% of visits to the hospital either one or two of my sisters accompanies me so I have lots of support.  Whilst they don't truly agree with my plan they have accepted it and just 'buddy' me. I am so thankful to them and got a bit sentimental when Bette Midler sang 'Wind beneath my wings'.  The words were just so appropriate to them. So now I must go to bed.  Thank you for your message.  I hope you tinker along 'chuddy blood' . ..... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

      "Content": "Hello there Ladies (and gents) Had my consultation on Thursday  18th after all the tests I had had done.  NO METASTESES.  YAHOOOOOOOO.  However he did say that there is a polyp on/in my gallbladder.  He is writing to my GP to get me to have an ultrasound so that it can be checked out.  If it's over 6mm (from the internet) there is a strong possibility of an op by laparoscopy - would not agree to an op that would slit me open.  BUT it's a decision I will have to make once I know the results of the US.  Consultant also gave me a quick US on right boob and things still seem to be static there. GP came back with blood tests.  In this test she went for the \"Anti-nuclear factor level\" which says \"potentially abnormal\" so she is going to check with a rheumatologist on Monday!  I have absolutely no aches or pains - not even from the Anastrozole - but then I do take a lot of supplements which I think is supporting my immune system.  In talking with a friend she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis years ago but had no symptoms then - but does have problems now!   She says she wished she had done more exercises so maybe I should up mine!!!!!  Wrote a note to the GP asking if the raised levels on the blood tests could be something to do with the polyp. I wasn't expecting to be told by the consultant that there were no metasteses but I am absolutely delighted to have been told this.  A big grin came across my face and I nudged my sister who had accompanied me.  Next appointment is in 6 months.  I will send my consultant any information garnered on the polyp on/in the gallbladder.  It's a wonderful Christmas present to be told that 2 years and 4 months down the line that your actions have not hurt you despite protestations from all around you, albeit in the early days. I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas and New Year.  I know I am. My love and hugs to you all from someone still fighting this nasty little critter",

      "Content": "Hi All DEM - you had your appointment on 3 March.  How did it go? On my front I had a call from some department at Kingston Hospital.  They had a slot for 9.25am on 10 March and would I be interested in taking it.  Said Yes and would they be following up with an appointment letter.  They told me this had been arranged by my GP.  Haven't received an appointment letter but have had two letters from the Immunology Clinic, Outpatients, requiring me to make an appointment.  Maybe the appointment letter will come tomorrow (Monday) and I will find out what appointment, where, I have agreed to!  Could also check with GP practice to see what has been put on my notes.  Post comes mid morning so I could check with GP in the interim and telephone the Immunology Clinic to see if the 9.25am slot is with them.  Got to admit I didn't think the 9.25am slot was with the Immunology Clinic - I thought it was with some other clinic but was so busy writing the date and time down, at the time, I did not ask the clinic/department again. Gotta admit that I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with the care I am being given by the NHS even though I haven't gone down the conventional route for breast cancer.  It is only with being diagnosed with breast cancer that the other things (wrong with me) have come to light.  One discussion said that good can come out of a cancer diagnosis - how true that is!  Report from the 2nd Thermogram - \"I am pleased to note that your report indicated that there are no significant thermal changes\", \"....both breasts are considered to be stable with no current thermal findings to suggest significant contagious spread of disease in the right breast\".  YAHOO.  Next thermogram on 14 July.

      "Content": "Hi All DEM - your full post was on 27 February.  Was there another one which has gone missing?  Your posting dates: 27 Feb, 9 Mar and 11 Mar are on this thread.  Can you remember when you posted and what? I cant see any response between 27 Feb and 9 Mar.  I do note that you have accepted the chemo treatment and I'm with you on being scared of that!  I send you all my positive thoughts on its outcome. On my front, I went for the appointment with Immunology.  Yes it was with this department.  The immunologist hadn't a clue why I was there!  I had brought with me the results of the three blood tests I had had done via the GP looking at the ALP test which was 194 when the ceiling is 130!  After lots of questions he suggested Paget's Disease.  Looking this up on the web it starts (linking it to my breast cancer) as scaly skin on the nipple.  Nope, I don't have scaly skin on or around the nipple or areola!  Don't have eczema, dermatitis or psoriasis which can make it difficult to diagnose.  The web thinks this is a pre-cursor to breast cancer.  I know I've got that.  He didn't do a physical.  It could also link with the bone but that has been 'cleared' from the bone scans. As a result I popped into my GP's to find out if there were any notes on why I was sent.  They got back to me by asking me to go in for a review as they didn't have a clue either!!!!  So I go tomorrow - Monday - to see the GP.   Maybe then we can figure it out.  My original GP has left and I will see the head of the practice this time.  Another 'head' to figure this out. For myself, I am actually quite well.  I don't have any other health issues which could affect me - physically and mentally!  Even though I have been diagnosed with BC the only problem I have is the hot flushes from the Anastrozole and they are lessening - so should I be worried about that!!  My head says that the endocrine therapy is working if I suffer from the side effects - how stupid is that as its the 'fillers' which cause the side effects!!  I am also 'aware' from my oncologist/surgeon that he did say that the endocrine therapy can/does stop working but also that it can get rid of the cancer.  He knows of two such cases.  As from my previous discussion we also know that the cancer is 'stable'.  Thoughts, Questions, Thoughts, Questions.  Yeeecccch - you could go nuts over this! Anyway will get back to you all after I have had my conflab with the GP. So, from someone  ... still fighting this nasty little critter... Love and positive thoughts are with you all.",

Due another thermogram scheduled for 8 December but I want to bring this forward a week.  Haven't yet talked with thermogram people about 'same results' from last time yet although I believe the tumour to be smaller. Also have a 6 month consult coming up for the 10 December with surgeon/oncologist.  I want to have an ultrasound just to check the tumour's not doing 'naughty things'. Added to my supplement list Boswellia Resin extract which is the active item in frankincense as well as using frankincense essential oil to rub onto skin from the outside - two-pronged approach.  No adverse reactions on either so carrying on.  This is ancient pharmacy and was worth a lot of money back then, which is why it was, along with myrrh, one of the gifts from the magi - people used it, and the myrrh, in healing.

      "Content": "Hi All Blimey, what a load of posts.  Thanks for all your comments.  I read them with great interest. The doctors DON'T comment on the link between the various supplements, outside scans, other bits I do, etc, as they can't.  They are not allowed to under NICE instructions and could be brought before the BMA and possibly struck off.  An additional factor is the Cancer Act which stops doctors from going down alternative paths.  In conventional treatments they ARE the experts.  When I chose to go for a second opinion I deliberately chose Professor Keshtgar as I believed the new trial of Photodynamic therapy he was undertaking was a truly brilliant new treatment for BC.  This treatment is way out of the box on the conventional but the catch 22 was that I would have had to have a mastectomy done 2 days later.  I didn't meet the criteria anyway but because of this innovative thinking I chose to stay with this consultant and he is happy to continue to monitor me.  'Almost' every time I am at a consultation (6 monthly) they try to get me to agree to surgery but with the continued shrinking of the tumour I view that what I am doing is the right route for me.  If things change I will think again. The change of diet and lifestyle has had numerous benefits on my wellbeing so that I no longer suffer with dyspepsia, bloating, headaches or any of the niggling things that occasionally take their toll on the body.  Any change in lifestyle to the betterment of health is a good thing.  I still have hot flushes and as the consultant said in one appointment the Anastrozole continues to work so why not continue on this part of the conventional treatment.  When I viewed the video film of Dr Dennis Slamon (discoverer of the endocrine therapy) women were given a second chance of life after the cancers had returned after conventional treatment. For decades we have had surgery and radiation. Innovations have been added along the way - chemo and the endocrine therapy \u2013 but, sadly, they have still not cured cancer. Clearly new therapies are/will be added to, systemically, cure cancer otherwise why would scientists still be continuing to research new therapies for BC. On the books are Gene Therapy, GcMAF, Photodynamics, SonoPhotodynamics, HIFU - amongst a few. Will one of these be the end of our cancer/s?  As George says who's to say that something I am taking may be advantageous in the resolution of breast cancer? My sisters have accepted my unconventional route but do sometimes come back with \u2018negative\u2019 answers when I \u2018spout off\u2019 on something I have learnt. I have learnt to accept their retorts just as I have accepted their stance on favouring the use of the conventional treatment. I understand the ramifications of my actions but so far I am doing fine. This discussion is for my benefit as are all the other discussions on this website for the benefit of the writers. I read the other discussions with great interest and pitch in where, I hope, I can help and support. Thanks once again for all your comments and I will update my discussion when I have something to report. Lots of love and look after yourselves \u2026. still fighting this nasty little critter\u2026",

Doctor mentioned a new 'tumour' and wanted to do a stereotactic mamm.  I said I had just had a mamm after 3 years of saying no so not prepared for have that.  By the way left boob okay.  In the end it was ascertained that the 'other tumour' was the lymph node.  They also said that the original tumour had increased to 11x9mm - bu--ar!  However I am not sure we are all talking about the same one!!  Got no size for the 'lymph' one!  I will however be having another US on Friday 25th with the Consultant Radiographer and I can tell you I will be asking some very searching questions.  Therefore Letrozole not working for me at all and Arimidex mentioned which I am happy to take.  Also discussed the trial Photodynamic therapy but as the Consultant/Oncologist on sick leave this has been stopped temporarily.  I am however hopeful that this will be resurrected.  According to my BCN nurse they were on the 2nd Phase of the trial.  Will ask more questions when I have a later consult on 7 September.  Hopefully I can talk with someone who knows about it and the criteria for taking part. So not good but not so bad. Eyesight - very slowly coming back.  30 August sees me go for a EchoCardiogram and 24hr Electrocardiogram.  Fun eh!  It just seems to keep on coming.  BORAX!!!!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Kay Thanks for the comments.  As you are aware we all hope for another treatment that looks good and can do the 'business' without the side effects but we also know that there can come a time when we have to go down the conventional route.  Everything about my case screams a good outcome on this route and to my benefit there is a little bit of time for me to think things through and do the research.  Not too long though and I have given myself, and in agreement with my consultant, one month before I decide (only 2 weeks in).  Additionally I have today talked with the Breast Cancer Nurse at my hospital and she is going away to do some research so that she also is up to date on the new treatment/s I have mentioned to her. The book dealite recommended, 'Dr Susan Love's Breast Book', is truly enhancing my knowledge and I have individually thanked her on this discussion. I never meant to offend and probably put into words what each and everyone one of us has thought at one time or another.  I'm just not conventional and have to find out as much as I can before making a decision because in the end it is my decision and I have to live with it.  I have a large family and circle of friends who now understand this and are willing to accept my final decision. I send you all the love I have and wish you a speedy recovery.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Many thanks for all the posts ladies.  I'm still here.  Still not had the op and radiotherapy.  Still taking alternative herbal medicine - can't hurt (but how to quantify).  Saw Onc and now on Anastrozole.  Tiny little tablet!  Read some other blogs that I might have very painful joints with this but see how we do.  Asked for second opinion and waiting for this.  Live in London and I was amazed at what different hospitals offer.  Found one that has some innovative treatments being used as well as studies into new.  Don't think we are quite at the point where these less invasive treatments can be offered (except in studies) but I do think that some of these will be treatments for early stage breast cancers in the not too distant future.  I just got breast cancer too early!  Mostly its down to funding for the studies.  The programme a couple of weeks ago to raise money for these studies was brilliant.  Cant remember how much they raised but all credit to getting this done.  Additionally stories in the news lately which mentions that, maybe, we don't all have to have surgery, radiation therapy and chemo! for our lumps - that I didn't know! BUT what we don't know is whether our cancers would just stay put and not do any harm!  And there lies the rub!  Wasn't too happy about the doctor who pressurised the lady to have the conventional treatment by browbeating her - think I would have kicked him in a sensitive area had he done that with me.  New guidelines coming out now put the onus on the consultants to ensure we are told fully of all treatments and to ensure that each lady knows their options. I felt that with my onc I was just another patient.  It was only when I stopped the op, went away and did some research that we now have a better understanding of each other.  There was just too much hurry! Anyway, when I've had my second opinion will come back to you with an update.  Lots of love and hugs XOXOXO",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies Many thanks for your comments.  ALL are duly noted.  A friend had/has breast cancer of the aggressive form and has had the surgery and seems to be fine.  Another friend also advised of a friend of hers who didn't have surgery,  died as a result and in so much pain.  Everything anyone says to me is taken on board as is the guy I found who is LIVING with his cancer 19 years on and the two women, as well as others, I have found who used their immune systems to beat their cancers without surgery.  One was a young lass with numerous cancers throughout her body and another did have breast cancer which resolved itself through her actions (what  - don't know). I have to own up that I still haven't rung my BCN nurse! I find that when I do remember it's a Thursday and I know how busy that day is!  It's consultation day and it's crowded beyond belief.  So many ladies, probably, with BC!  I'll try and ring Monday.  I know I MUST do it. I do read most of the threads - mainly it's the ones that have headliners which catch my interest.  I would like to respond in a lot of cases but as I haven't gone down the majority line I would feel a bit ignorant/hypocritical putting forward my bit so I carry on writing on my thread.  What is strengthening my resolve, in my case, are the numerous additional problems that seem to come with having the surgery.  I really do feel for all the ladies that have suffered as a result.  I am still of a mind to have Sono-Photodynamic therapy and if at the next US it shows that it has grown then I will opt for this. I hope you all read the link to the article on the trial for Photodynamic therapy at the Royal Free.  As I have said previously this, potentially, new form of treatment is looking like its the way forward and can be done as many times as is necessary to get rid of BC.

      "Content": "Hello Ladies Well.......... I had my appointment with the consultant on 8 May and, low and behold, the 12mm they quoted were microcalcifications - NOT THE TUMOUR.  The consultant did ask if I was ready to agree to any 'intervention' but based on the information I was just given I said no.  I also asked about the trial and now, a total of 9 wonderful, wonderful ladies had taken up the challenge.  I had hoped that more patients would have signed up to this by now but maybe it is designed for specific breast cancers.  They need 30 ladies to agree for the first phase.  I did say that if Phase 2 was to do the photodynamics without lopping off the boob then I would be first on the list!  When I had the US on 1 May radiographer said lymph nodes were still CLEAR, she did a full US on all the boob and after that did a full tour for me showing all the ducts with calcifications but not giving me any measurements.  Those pictures I will purchase at a later date. I also had a mammogram which started off badly when the lady radiographer was becoming a bit 'demanding' when I was just starting to take off my top clothes.  I was contradicting what was clearly a mind-set.  I was very nearly on the verge of walking out but she went to take advice from someone and came back with my wonderful Aussie lady who completely diffused the situation.  Good mamms were done but without the pain.  Having said that one of them did hurt a bit more than I would have liked but we got a good picture.  I get the written report on these in 2 weeks time - can't wait to see what it says.  Additionally will go and order the pictures so I can see what they see for myself.  Now I really do have to say something about the negativity of some of the posts on my thread.  At no time have I made any devastating comments on anyone else's threads.  If you cannot support another lady with their decision and only have negative thoughts on their actions then do not comment!  Keep them to yourself.  You know yourself how a passing off the cuff comment devastates YOU.  So why do YOU think YOU can do it to someone else! My initial response was to stop writing but writing in my thread is acting as a catharsis by sharing my plan of action with the wider world and hopefully empowering women to stop, think and ask about their disease and knowledgably choose their treatment.  These last comments may be the end of this thread and that I will accept with grace.  If I have offended anyone I apologise up front. But please be assured that I will be with you in mind and spirit and will ......still be fighting this nasty little critter.......  ",

I am so sorry to hear of the problems you have experienced going down the conventional line.  In reading a lot of the stories on this website plus the few ladies I know have had breast cancer and stories from friends on the horrors experienced by some of their friends I knew I just could not submit to any 'interference' except for the endocrine therapy which is systemic so will 'block' any of the 'nasty little critters' should they try to settle elsewhere.

      "Content": "Hi All Saw my oncologist today and, YEP, the Everolimus not the Exemestane is the cause of my hives/skin rash.  They were under the impression that I was on 10mg of it per day so have given me one week off it to clear the system - and, hopefully - completely clear me of the hives/skin rash then I start taking 5mg per day. UNTIL I got home and found out that I was only, ever, on 5mg.  As I was having to deal with the toothache I forgot to INCREASE the level to 10mg.  HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS what state I would be in had I taken the 10mg!!!!!  Rang them and apprised them of the situation and they have advised that after the one week off the Everolimus I start taking the 5mg tablet every other day, thus making the dosage 2.5mg a day, until I go back to see them on 6 December 2017. So what is Everolimus?  It is a kinase inhibitor (biological inhibitor), mTOR inhibitor targeted therapy and a single transduction inhibitor.  NOT an antineoplastic chemotherapy drug so this is not chemo. I asked what I could expect, next, from this drug.  So how long is a piece of string?  Seems that in the data collected they don't actually record WHEN new side effects happen at particular times with individuals.  Individuals are the key and as with Salamander65 her first problems, within days, was nausea and nose bleeds which I haven't had. I am all for this genomic testing that Prof Dame Sally Davies, our Chief Medical Officer, is after.  Link below will give you the insight into this.  This should help to target therapies which are personalised for your particular cancer. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40479533 I also asked about the life-threatening side effects.  Oh, how they do dismiss these.  Their take is that it hasn't happened yet so why worry.  I feel I need to know what I should be looking out for.  We dismiss a lot of personal health stuff as trivial until it becomes a problem by which time it could have become truly hazardous.  For example, my heart has come up, to coin it, tickety boo.  I would be horrified to learn that the Everolimus or Exemestane had damaged it in some way let alone kidney, liver or lung damage. Cyst in the crease in the armpit turned out to be just that.  Was given a copy of the radiographers report on my US. Will have to get the digital scan.  Have been able to locate 2 of the armpit lymph node involvement - just need to find the other 2.  Mamm done on 2 August shows no sign of any of these!!!!!! So for the moment I am Everolimus free.  Will come back later when more known. Lots of love and hugs to everyone",

Having said the above I went for a blood test with my GP and the Alkaline phosphatase level is quite high - in fact over the recommended ceiling.  However it is not supported by the serum gamma-glutamyl transferase level which would show a problem in the liver.  It could however be something to do with the bones so my GP is referring me back to the consultant/oncologist for tests, maybe.  Possibly need to have another DEXA scan.

Still not heard anything from the surgeon/oncologist about a new appointment.  Will check Monday to see if GP has sent the last blood result. On a 'statin' at the moment for cholesterol and everything that I have watched and read says I should stop taking this tablet.  A growing idea is forming that as I was put on an increased dosage this could have something to do with the raised levels!  Can deal with it in a natural way by eating an apple or plum or 4/5 small carrots a day!!

Clogheen, loved your bit - made me laugh.  Never thought about eating sparrow!  KentStar, so sorry to hear that cancer has been a really nasty critter in your family.  In my case, I have researched everything to do with my case, weighed up the pros and cons and made a decision.  I am always learning as different things crop up, ie when reading the other messages I research some of those things like the DIEP flap.  Yeowww on that one!  I am not in the healthcare business nor in the scientific field either.  I just felt that for all of my life I have not had to worry about my health.  When I needed to see the doc I went and these were only minor things.  BUT being diagnosed with BC is a different kettle of fish and because of the route they wanted to take I felt that I should know more about it. I wasn't advised of a healthy diet, exercise, supplements etc.  I imagine, from the conversations on here, these come after surgery or the chemo, ie no grapefruit, etc.  At the Mulberry Centre at West Middx Hospital I pulled all the booklets off the shelf to do with BC and all the bits on complimentary therapies.  The complimentary therapies only help minimally but at least there is some merit in them to de-stress.  Overwork is another \u2013 get used to telling your boss to \u2018s.. off\u2019 for constant overtime requirements \u2013 you need time for yourself, leisure etc but don\u2019t over-indulge.  Booze is a very rare part of my life. So I went on the web and am truly amazed at what you can find there at your fingertips.  This has led me to my current course of action. Hairworries, herewith list of the supplements I take: Astragalus \u2013 immune booster Resveratrol (red wine extract) \u2013 fights yeast and fungal growth, anti-inflammatory, acts against COX-2, stops tumour cell growth, suppresses metasteses, attacks cancer cells in body by increasing levels of two proteins \u2013 perforin and granzyme B Mushroom complex \u2013 additional help for immune system Turmeric \u2013 inhibits multitude of cancer pathways, stops action of enzyme COX-2, inhibits vascular epithelial growth factors essential to blood supply to tumour, kills B-lymphoma cells, limits environmental damage, inhibits leukaemia cells, gets rid of metals in body Chlorella \u2013 communication help between cells and immune system, boosts white immune cell levels \u2013 interferon and T-cells, enhances levels of lactobacillus, beta carotene (10 x levels in carrots), organic iron (58x richer than spinach, vitamins D & K Spirulina \u2013 as Chlorella but each work better with each other Red Clover \u2013 contains isoflavone and phytoestrogens, blood purifier, contains genistein (blocks receptors to oestrodiol, also good for getting rid of microcalcifications and macrocalcifications (0 grade DCIS) Nettle \u2013 helping to get rid of microcalcifications, macrocalcifications Magnesium \u2013 for absorption of calcium tablet into the bone Aspirin \u2013 possible cancer prevention, halt metasteses, extend survival times Immiflex (stimulate immune system) \u2013 beta-glucans Immunokinoko (immunosenessence that works on older people and their immune system) \u2013 mushroom complex Krill Oil (omega 3 fatty acid \u2013 anti-inflammatory \u2013 has omega 3, 6, 9, Vits A and E, astaxanthin Pancreatin (enzyme support) ActivaMune (Diindolymethyl - oestrogen blocker) \u2013 Vit C, D3, E Pomegranate \u2013 combats yeast infection in gut Multivitamins Cranberry capsules Garlic capsules Anastrozole Calcium with D3 Raspberry ketones - to help lose weight!!!!

      "Content": "Hello to everyone interested in my cancer Where do I start on my Oncology consult today Started by getting Biopsy results 2 Lesions are Grade 3 from the high grade DCIS \u2013 also said was pre-cancerous! Lesion 1 (had biopsy done in 2012 showing ER8/PR8) (right breast 9am position 2.6cms from nipple) Now ER/6, PR/3, HER2/indeterminate \u2013 will go for further tests Lesion 2 \u2013 no biopsy taken, ever ER/0, PR/0, HER/0 \u2013 effectively triple negative So effectively I still have cancer \u2013 in their estimation. Asked how they had arrived at this. Look at the cells first to determine cancer or not, then check on receptor enzymes. There was a 'paper' the oncologist mentioned but she had left on the desk upstairs!!!!!  Can't recall which paper she said it was. NM Bone scan is clear of mets, CT scan clear of mets but noted were the lymph nodes in the axilla. SO VERY GOOD NEWS HERE. I do NOT believe myself to now have the cancer they think!  BUT WILLING TO BE PERSUADED IF OTHERWISE. Sorting out 2nd opinion on biopsies (looking at Royal Marsden). Oncologist said that they are quite happy to send tissue/slides for 2nd opinion but corrected herself to slides only!!!!! Royal Free, however, are still happy to send to chosen 2nd opinion hospital. Still trying to get pathology reports on EACH the 7 core punch biopsies taken. Oncologist stopped Chemo Nurse, attending on a fact finding session, from commenting at one point!!!!!! How can I trust this team when clearly any open comment could have been deemed as enlightening the patient!! During the consult there were a number of errors made by the oncologist to which when challenged were corrected. Lesion 2 \u2018has changed\u2019. How can it have changed when no biopsy was done in the first place!! Corrected herself to sending slides only for 2nd opinion rather than both tissue and/or slides when she first spoke of 2nd opinion? Information not been received by me - location of the \u2018affected\u2019 lymph node/s (asked for this information LONG BEFORE 27 October ultrasound but still have not received) - location of biopsied lymph node which they say was in Axilla but bruising I experienced did not conform to that location particularly as it sat between 2 blood vessels Questions/Inconsistencies - advised in a letter, from a complaint, that I had metastatic cancer - not locally advanced (it may just be \u2018terminology\u2019) but was not told verbally - is the rapid agreement for a 2nd opinion a hope to getting rid of this difficult patient! - have I questioned them too much which has opened up the inconsistencies of their diagnosis/treatment? - some write-up of reports are in error and not corrected - do I trust them (Royal Free) \u2013 NO! Do I believe there is an ongoing \u2018cover up\u2019? - will the referral letter from the Royal Free be \u2018opinion free\u2019? - am I of a suspicious mind also \u2018just because I don\u2019t get to hear what I want\u2019! Just give me the requisite facts and I can then make a proper decision! STORY - END OF For some on this website, this write up will be a vindication of their stance. For those of you enlightened enough to see above all this I will be taking this further. An email has gone off to my private clinic for their thoughts on this information with even the possibility of my 5 September consultation at that clinic being brought forward to discuss and potentially plan a way forward. Up to last night I have every indication that I now had fibrosis/inflammation as a result of the SPDT treatment. That All cancer was dead. What I don\u2019t have is TRUST in the Royal Free team who have been undertaking my care. Too many inconsistencies, poor record recording, change of mind on what they have said, off the cuff comments which reveal how rigid they are, belittling any of the alternatives I put forward of advancing breast cancer treatment, writing in letter/s that you have metastatic cancer but not told the patient!, cold consults which demean and belittle the patient who may have a brain in their head \u2013 you name it I think I received it! To say that my mental wellbeing is at an all-time low is an understatement. Until I get further answers I doubt I can rise above it, at the moment. Stress plays an important part in cancer - they fail, miserably, to understand this. What I should be is bl..dy angry. It might change to this. For everyone out there, I send love and virtual hugs on this fcuk journey. STORY, END OF",

So, to an update.  Report on mammo says benign foci of calcification found in left breast with no malignancy. Report on CT of abdomen says 1 x 4mm lesion, could be a small calculus but may be a polyp, no biliary tree dilatation; normal pancreas, pancreatic duct; kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, urinary bladder and pelvic organs do not demonstrate significant pathology.  They also say that there is scattered colonic diverticulitis!  No evidence of bone metasteses.  Possible gallbladder polyp - suggest US to further assess.  Scheduled to have US on gallbladder 5 February.  When I went into GPs' in January the form was ready and waiting for me to pick up which had been filled out by the GP on 22 December 2014!!!!  No-one had rung me or sent a text to inform me it was waiting to be picked up and for me to ring my local hospital to make the appointment!  Can't have anything to eat beforehand so good job it's at 9am. Report on bone scan - uptake of tracer in skull likely benign possibly related to hair styling (I have short hair!).  3 times I fell off a swing - as a kid, stall holder dismantling stall jumped up to get a piece of wood off the top and it hit my head and, not least, fainting and catching my head on a door jamb with heaven only knows how many other knocks in between!@!!.  Just wondering if I'm mentally stable now after that lot!!!!!  Heterogeneous uptake within the spine with no focal abnormality identified.  (I have a bony spur (osteophyte) on L5S1 which was identified on 9 January 2014 so this could be it.) So there you have it.  Some little things to keep a watch on but then I am 60 now and you would expect a few 'failings' at this age!!

Went into Tesco after the group to buy some beany hats. So now I have to look forward to losing more hair.  Oh joy!  NOT. Love to everyone",

Such a dilemma.  Wonder when I will get the appointments and what will be contained in them about medications!  Will they have thought about this?  Sometimes I do think I am a guinea pig. Have told them each and every time after cycles 1 and 2 that I thought the 3-weekly cycles were wrong.  In the 3rd week I find that I am prone to a lot of boob ache/pain although I do have it during weeks one and two.  I think I have diarised some form of ache or pain each and every day.  They can't advise what this stems from but if we talk about Lesion 1 pressing more and more against the skin then I think the chemo isn't working on one of the cancer 'types' but which one?  I had hoped that the routine would be changed, at least, to 2-weekly but I don't think that thought has crossed the oncologist's head!  I did mention it at the consult after cycle 1. And I confirmed this again at the consult on Wednesday but 2 different oncologists! Not happy at that as I have said above. So I am still being subjected to this protocol without them thinking on their feet when information given by the patient is showing a cause for a re-think. If they want to do progress to the Paclitaxol then fine or surgery, then fine. Just think a change of treatment is required. Love and hugs to you and everybody",

When having thermograms the technician has to take various factors into account like room temp, body temp, etc. The same settings are not used each time the thermogram is done. This thermogram is vastly different from the previous 2 thermograms I have had done and the technician doesn't understand why this has happened as I haven't done anything different in diet, supplements or exercise.  Most of the lymph congestion has gone.  However I did tell her that I had increased my intake of Vitamin D3 up to 10,000iu a day.  She didn't think that this could be the cause but has marked this down so that it can help the experts in giving their opinion on these scans and reporting back.  Can't wait to hear what they say!!!!! Was this a good day?  H*ll YES. When I get the report back I'll give you an update.  I have to admit that, as yet, I haven't gone back to the hospital to get a copy of my US nor the report on this done on 2 July but will do so when time permits.

Together, these mechanisms facilitate effector T cell killing of irradiated tumour cells and priming of antigen-presenting cells to increase the adaptive immune response against tumour cells elsewhere in the body, in non-irradiated areas.

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Update: So I have now had my first and second palliative radiotherapy sessions (fast track). Unfortunately after the first \u2018pass\u2019 of radiation, between myself and the radiation team I had to have a small break. I was having pain due to how the breast was \u2018lying\u2019. It didn\u2019t help that I had not been made aware beforehand of a \u2018bolus\u2019 placed over the breast which although relatively light added to the \u2018pressure\u2019 on the boob. The pain came from below the breast on a lump below the crease line where some nodules are now appearing and red/pink in colour. I can tell you I had tears in my eyes when the first pass finished and they noticed it. I just knew I could not move at the time of the radiation as it would have gone into the wrong areas. I think this made the pain worse as prior to the first session, if this happened, I would always adjust my position \u2013 as anyone would. I had to go to the GP for painkillers (Zapain) on Monday (3 December). She prescribed 30mg Zapain (codeine phosphate/Paracetamol) capsules. Can take up to 8 a day under medical supervision, over the counter preps are 8mg. When I showed her my boob she readily understood!!!! Said could get stronger meds (morphine based) if needed. Next day before the session I was actually due a dose of the Zapain but had been able, beforehand, to stretch this to 5 hours which would have included the radiotherapy time. During the 15 minute break I took the tablets, composed myself and was able to do the next bit. However it is clear that it is the \u2018bolus\u2019 which was the problem as I started to hurt again in one of the areas below the crease line. Told the radiographer as much. Has anyone ever had a \u2018bolus\u2019 placed over their boob? Haven\u2019t been able to find anything in peoples\u2019 write-ups. Web says a bolus is a waxy tissue equivalent material (pad) placed on the skin surface to homogenize or modulate the range of the dose from external beams of radiation. Talked again yesterday with radiographer. They say it helps to level out the beam to the area they want to target. They also have to tape this pad down on the boob. They did it very lightly yesterday (11th Dec \u2013 2nd session) but it still built up to a bit of pain by the time they did the first pass. They told me I am doing well but still causing pain! They also have to tape it down so that there is no air trapped! I don\u2019t know if I am being given a load of hogwash on this! Bought some Aloe Vera gel \u2013 maximum strength \u2013 from Dr Organics to put on. Saturday morning (8 Dec) I found something irritating my breast. It was a small congealed solid mass of the gel. It had caused one of my lesions to bleed with lymph stuff. Was easy to peel off. After showering noticed lymph seepage. I was able to put on a plaster which the hospital had given me although it isn\u2019t quite big enough to cover all of the lesions and is said to come off easily without damaging skin. Can\u2019t wear bras or soft tops as they put pressure on the boob and it starts to hurt. Stopped using Aloe. Also got saline phials and wipes from the hospital. Every week I have to see the Senior Radiotherapy Nurse! He replaced existing plaster after swab which caused more pain so have had to cut off a piece which he had placed on the boob like a \u2018diamond\u2019 rather than the \u2018square\u2019 I had done. 3 more radiotherapy sessions to go. 2 would have been 25 Dec and 1 Jan! These ones will be brought forward 1 day beforehand. 1 Jan (31 Dec 2018) will be the last one. CT Thorax Abdomen Pelvis booked for 30 Dec. Consult back with Oncologist 2 Jan 2019. My boob is swollen from the radiotherapy as well. Ordered the R1/R2 creams and have just read that I cannot use them on open wounds. Maybe I can use it around these but since receipt of these have been told not to use them. On 11 Dec swab taken to check for infection. Will get results of that at my next radiotherapy session. One lump below breast but ABOVE crease line (mammary fold) really red and hurts \u2013 this is where some of the pain stems from. Did anyone have a swollen boob after their radiotherapy? They say it has to get worse before it gets better!!!!!! Health is fine though a little phlegmy. Cough gone just the phlegm left. Still taking the innohep for blood clot on lung \u2013 bruising minimal now that I have got the hang of it \u2013 you need to do the injection very slowly over about 20-30 seconds. I had been injecting it too quickly. Love and virtual hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi All Update: SO, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF \u201cRADIATION RECALL\u201d? You can find info on the web. Basically this is when you have had radiotherapy and have been put back onto chemo very quickly after it. I have had \u2018one hell of a time\u2019 because of this as it manifests as radiation burns! My last session of radiotherapy was 31 December 2018. I was a little pink on the boob and still dealing with the strep infection on the surface lesions. Correction here \u2013 advised you of using collogen plaster over lesions, it\u2019s not collogen but silicone wound contact layer/plaster (safetax technology \u2013 which means it is easy to take off). Therefore I was told I could not put any cream WHATSOEVER on any of the boob and complied. I was put onto the Paclitaxel on 10 January 2019. Having not been told about it the resultant burgeoning deep redness and peeling of the skin I took it to be a normal side effect of the radiotherapy. Certainly I haven\u2019t read anything on here about it nor in any of the literature received or of any ladies who have reported as suffering from it. AND was neither told by the Consultant Radiologist/Oncologist nor even the Oncologist about it to possibly look for it who had quickly put me onto the next chemo regimen (Paclitaxel) because of the lesions in my liver! In fact when I found out, I searched the web who say this happens in 9% of cases which, to me, is quite large. It is a very poorly understood \u2018syndrome\u2019. Clearly here, there is a reason WHY the medics HAVE to give time between finishing one treatment before starting another. This is very likely the reason why we have to wait at least 1 week between each Paclitaxel treatment so that the body can recover from the onslaught. AND a week\u2019s rest after your 3rd dose of Paclitaxel in order that Red and White Blood counts, Platelets and Neutrofils can recover. Certainly these are the only \u2018counts\u2019 that are recorded in my chemo book. Over the 5 weeks of radiotherapy all of these \u2018counts\u2019 recovered brilliantly and in most cases increased but are now falling off again with the constant 3 \u2018weekly\u2019 doses of Paclitaxel. My boob is now recovering from the radiation \u2018burns\u2019 but only at my ignoring what the medics say I should do on this point. I asked why I could not put cream on the other areas of the boob not known to have the strep infection. They advised that I could but it would be at my own risk as the cream could cause a bigger infection which they wanted to avoid at all costs. That was told to me when they \u2018believed\u2019 that I was suffering from Radiation Recall at the Oncologist consult on 30 January 2019 (my radiation \u2018burn\u2019 had begun to manifest on 15 January 2019 \u2013 by 21 January it was at its worst). I lashed on the E45 cream after that bit of info and the relief from itching and pain was too immense to explain in words. My boob always seems to feel \u2018warm\u2019 to touch and I have niggling bits of itchiness still but at least most of the redness has gone. When I looked at the boob yesterday I thought that this next round of Paclitaxel just \u2018might\u2019 be the Radiation Recall coming back. I\u2019m keeping an eye on it and taking regular photos so I have a record. In fact my mobile is full of my boobie!!!!! (Ironically, the strep infection might have \u2018eaten\u2019 some of the tumours below the boob and the big lesion I had at the 3oclock position. But the medics say that it is most likely the Pac. What about the use of virotherapy as a treatment! Still so much that they really do not know about.) I still have one lesion below the boob which didn\u2019t have the strep infection but neither the radiation or Pac \u2018seem\u2019 to have had any effect on it either! This one can cause pain when trapped between my \u2018down south\u2019 boobie and tum! Still taking the morphine which helps with this. I am due to have a CT scan after finishing this 2nd \u2018cycle\u2019 of 3 Paclitaxel to check on the liver lesions but have yet to wait for the appointment. Request was made in my notes at my consult on 30 January 2019 to be done but I am still awaiting this. Must give them a ring as it is now at least 12 days since. These people haven\u2019t followed through the request. Next Oncology consult is 6 March and this CT scan \u2018should\u2019 be performed before then!!!!!! Saw the Community Palliative Care Nurse on 22 January 2019. Not debilitated far enough for any of these services YET but she went off with a list of things she would research and possibly put in place for me to see so that, at least, I would have the general info for the future. She arranged for District Nurse to see me about my boob \u2018wounds\u2019 who finally came on 4 February. Next visit just to check on wounds will be w/c 18 February, no firm date set. Side effects from Paclitaxel: none that I can readily identify except for fatigue. Am finding I don\u2019t have the \u2018sparkle\u2019 I used to have. Oncologist was very happy I didn\u2019t have peripheral neuropathy! What about the Radiation Recall! Sheesh!@! Oncologist also \u2018felt\u2019 that the breast had got softer! Yeah, right! Noticing an ache at the top of my right lung. Could be radiation damage. Will ensure that when I get the CT scan that the radiographer checks on this. So, my opinion of the standard treatment \u2013 ABSOLUTE PANTS. There has gotta be a better way than this. Story \u2013 end of. Will bring back an update when I have more. Love to all on this \u2018PANTS\u2019 journey.",

With regards to getting this nasty little critter I have read that it could stem from an viral infection.  I had some boils (in a funny place) 5 years ago and was running a temperature and feeling 'wabbit'.  As tumours cannot be seen on a mamm until they have proliferated to 1 billion + cells and takes (well mine did and possibly everyone elses) 5 years to get to my growth size I am linking it with the boils.  At a support group someone told me they knew someone else who had boils!!!!  Now it's only two people, I know, but........ I was also stressed due to being made redundant.  If you get your thinking caps on you might just be able to pinpoint some possible causes.  You need to think about what could have depressed your immune system and caused the cells to proliferate. I don't have any of the other health problems as I have seen from the website message which could account for it.  Start writing them down.  Oh and on an 'upper' make a bucket list of the thing/things you most want to do when you finally beat the cancer into submission.  I have and its for that purpose only.

However it all depends on what the experts say when I go the breast clinic on 18 December! Now just gotta go and have the blood test done again at my GP's.  When I get the results of that I'll make sure that I take a copy with me to the consultant for their files.  Hope that one comes back just as good otherwise there is an unknown problem at large in my body!!!!

Slightly 'anxious' about my 2nd biopsy I had for the lymph node which is a minimally invasive procedure but I had such a bruise afterwards!  Know of cases where biopsies have 'seeded' another tumour.  Gotta feel positive though that 4 years down the line I am relatively okay. Now thinking I really need to do something radical!  One on the horizon is Rerum, a better version of the GC-MAF - if you know of any of the alternative treatments - but you can only get that abroad.  Just heard of a new machine whereby it measures the liquid in your body and gives the medical team a readout of 130 'enzymes' in your body giving doctors more information at their fingertips.  However this is used in alternative therapy so that diet, etc., can be tuned to the person, ie. would eating red meat be good for you or would it help the cancer to grow.  Mind-boggling what's going on out there but not in the UK.  This would replace a blood test with good accuracy. Another little gem I learnt today is as I don't do mammogrammes any more, only ultrasound, and if you choose to use thermograms as well they can be up to 98% more effective at giving a diagnosis. Any way, that's all for now.  Thanks for the discussion.  Take of yourself. .... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

Renewed the Letrozole for the next 3 months.  Currently on Accord and have a couple of weeks to go.   Pharmacist gave me 1 x Manx Healthcare box and 2 x Dr. Reddy's.  Which box should I choose next, I wonder?  You will note that these brands have not hit our discussions so will be interesting to see if I suffer with any side effects!  Not currently experiencing any side effects except for the hot flushes of course.  Does this mean I am still menopausal!!!!!!!!  No periods at all or any indication but then at 62 - heavens, isn't that 'old sounding' - I don't think I should be having any anyway! Next consultation on BC on 9 February at 2.50pm.  No tests done so no idea how the Letrozole has done on my BC.  Methinks I should have an US BEFORE the consultation so that we can discuss it at the consultation but this was not what was booked 6 months ago.  Seems a bit 'arse about face' to me!  When I do get the next US I will ensure the operator checks on the lymph node. Thought a couple of times I could feel the 'little critter' but just lately haven't been able to find 'it' again.  Ho hum, will cop another feel before bed tonight which I should go to soon.

      "Content": "HI All Well a few things have happened over the succeeding weeks.  Had Ultrasound on 31 December 2015 on both boobs.  Saw consultant (not the Polish guy - unfortunately he was only a locum - DAMN) on 14 January 2016.  Now they are saying that it has reduced - wait for it - to 7x5mm from 10mm!  I know that the Polish guy mentioned 10mm at his consultation but I have no idea where this measurement came from.  I do know that the tumour on 8 Aug 2013 was 5x5x7mm with the microcalcifications from a report on 1 May 2014 at 10x6mm.  Initially they were asserting that this size was the tumour - and it seems they still are.  So from a positive stance - YAAAYYYY - you could say my tumour is still reducing!!! You will recall that I had started the Boswellia Resin Extract (Frankincense) once a day with Frankincense Oil rubbed on at night.  Wonder if it is this that has made a difference - but how to quantify! I also reviewed the US scans of 1 May 2014 and noticed the tumour with a black blob next to it which wasn't shadowing as can be seen under tumours on US.  Asked the consultant about this and it turns out that when my tumour reduced it sort of split into two - the dark blob is the dead tumour.  Now I didn't know this.  Have tried to google dead tumours in situ but can't find any.  Most tumours that then die are the ones that have been cut out!  This dark blob is weird - it looks like a dried up flat mud pile with fissures/cracks in it.  Having just looked again there is a regularity in the 'fissures'.  I wonder if it is the coils from the titanium clip!!!!!  Interesting!  Not doing any harm so is being left be! Next appointment is in July and as it will have been 2 years since the last mamm on the right boob I think I would like to see 'the state of play' with it.  Acceptable risk and all that. So I am a 'happy bunny'.  My love to all of you dealing with this insidious little b*****.  Will come back when I know more. .... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

      "Content": "Hi All Sorry for the delay in getting back to you but much has been going on. Tried to get repeat prescription from GP of Arimidex and was told categorically that they would not sanction it. Now I ask myself WHY some women in the UK are prescribed this and not others? I have questioned this with the CCG as GP had already sought guidance from them who advised not to prescribe. CCG are investigating with GP and hospital. As a result of this stress I checked with Oncology at the hospital for the appointment I had yet to receive and have had that on 4 October. I agreed to be put on Exemestane and Everolimus (the everolimus makes the exemestane work better \u2013 they say). Everolimus does have some bad side effects which I am hoping to escape!!!! Like lesions on the lungs!!!!! I was also prescribed Lemon Mucilage which is a liquid anti inflammatory (probably from the exem. and ever.). Exemestane tablets on the web cost £167.59 for a 30 day period and Everolimus £2822 (how much it is for the NHS I don\u2019t know) and certainly the Oncologist said she would have to get approval for the Everolimus. Other potential treatments (for the future) Tamoxifen (in which case I will have to stop the Clopidogrel which stops my platelets from clumping together so that I don\u2019t form clots easily and would become a \u2018bleeder\u2019 when combined with the Tamoxifen) or Fulvestrant which would mean jabs in the bum!!! On my new treatment I have to go back on 18th October for another appointment and blood test to see how I am coping with it. So far no side effects although have had a few hot flushes. Received a copy of the BC consultant\u2019s letter which says original tumour is now at 11x9mm with architectural distortion over 80mm in area (boob looks fine here externally but could be distorted internally). Reactive lymph node (existing known tumour) is 11x11mm!!!!! -flaming heck \u2013 with cortical thickness of 8mm. New area of concern, from the nipple approx. 90mm, is a 16mm length area of \u2018concern\u2019 with bilateral benign calcifications. Can feel this. Can also feel this \u2018disappearing\u2019 as the exem. and ever. work (only 7 days in!!!!!). Also mentioned \u2018two neoplastic appearing lymph nodes\u2019 \u2013 on this I don\u2019t know if one of them could be the one already mentioned or whether there are now 3!!! I now have copies of the scans and I think there are only 2 lymph nodes \u2018affected\u2019. Can\u2019t feel either. Letter also quotes putting me back onto Anastrozole!!!!! Not the Arimidex. Sheesh. (GP said £1 for generic or £80 for original.) Wonder what the GP\u2019s going to make of the new treatment costs!!!!!!! On top of all that I am sorting out the house of stuff I really don\u2019t need so that I can sell up to move back up North. Houses there are cheaper to buy and I can use the left over equity to supplement state pension when I retire. However I will also use some of my personal pensions 25% tax free portion to find an alternative therapy outside the UK or try to find out if I can do this at a clinic I have found in the UK \u2013 will need clearance and approval from the powers that be in the UK for UK treatment but it will not necessary for outside UK unless I try to get NHS to fund for me!!!!! So much to do. Take care of yourselves ladies (and gents). Will come back on my discussion after 18th Oct appointment with the necessary blood test.",

Checked out the proton therapy.  It's still radiation although immensely better as it is much more targetted.  As my tumour is in my right boob I wouldn't have any concerns with regard to potential heart or lung damage that you can get from standard radiotherapy.  It's a potential treatment I have logged in my head simply because it is less damaging. patrb - many thanks for your comments.

      "Content": "Hi All Had my consult on the 9th and as I said in previous posting 'arse about face' with the US being done afterwards, just today in fact.  Grilled the radiographer, who was the consultant radiographer, who seemed very knowledgeable.  Had a young woman in tow who was his junior I suppose.  She herself was very confident and actually did the US.  Together they looked at the US done in Sept 16 and the measurements today - tumour is still the same - 8mm (depth) x 6mm (width) - don't know the length!  Lymph node still at 0.31mm which I can't feel now.  Was able as I have said before that I thought I could feel the tumour but over the past week have not been able to (properly) - but it is still there as a marrowfat pea size.  Ho hum. Still it hasn't grown and I suppose I should be glad about that.  Will write more when I have had the consult next week.  Love to everyone.",

      "Content": "Hi Lavendergirl Hives have now stopped itching and being an angry red but still have to clear their 'marks'.  Now got something on hands and between toes where skin is 'peeling' and causing a lot of problems.  GP said to continue with Diprobase I got yesterday. Yes, the breast care team and the oncologist - well first time I met with them - do keep asking if I will have surgery.  Frightening statement by them is that you can get to a 'point of no return'.  The breast care team at my last appointment now want to do mastectomy.  That's a bit too far for me.  'Primary tumour' (from MDT team they say at 11x9mm - at diagnosis 13x7x21mm) I have never been able to feel, even now. Latest ultrasound scan report says 6x10x6mm. Still to get the scan itself. I can actually feel the new area of concern more posteriorly at 16mm of which latest ultrasound says 7x12x7mm which hasn't had a biopsy to determine if it is cancerous.  Unfortunately I believe that the FNA they did on one of my axillary lymph nodes has caused it to grow exponentially thus confirming that the new area is very likely cancerous and that with every invasive procedure the potential for spread is coming true.  With the new treatment I do believe the new area of concern to be reducing (as above) and I like to think that this is also coming true for the rest of the tumours.  Certainly the latest ultrasound report is confirming this as opposed to the latest breast care team letter/s. I cannot 'feel' the axillary lymph node at the 6 o\u2019clock position of the axillary array (at the edge of the boob at the 9 o\u2019clock position) although I should as the MDT team say it measured 11x11mm. This is the one I thought they did the FNA on. The new scan report measures it at 11x6mm.  Can't find it on the mamm scan but it is on the US so some resolution here. Also found the position of the other axillary lymph node they mentioned at a previous scan which I can't feel and is located within the middle of armpit area between the armpit and the boob.  Just need to find out where the other 2 are they think may be a problem - all I think as a result of the FNA but could be as a result of the Letrozole not doing a damn thing for me. Crucially this report does not mention the latter of these axillary nodes nor the other 2 suspect ones! The point FOR any surgery is that the tumour cell load is reduced thus allowing your immune system to mop up any stray circulating tumour cells. The Exemestane and Everolimus seem to be doing a good job on the tumours so I expect it is doing the same to the circulating tumour cells. Just wish this treatment hadn\u2019t come along with the hives/skin rash! Still, will keep on using it. One of the letters from the oncologist to my GP said \u201cwith systemic endocrine treatments there is a law of diminishing returns in that the strength of response to each agent in turn tends to diminish with line of therapy\u201d. AND I read somewhere that surgery is the CORE therapy of conventional treatment. So \u2013 can I find a surgeon willing to take out 2 areas of concern in the boob and simply take out the affected axillary lymph nodes? Could I find one that would use a CO2 laser rather than a scalpel and cautorising blood vessels that leads to pain afterwards? Questions? Research? All ongoing. New things heading our way but still a ways to go: Intrabeam (radiotherapy) Radio wave breast imaging (you lay down like in an MRI with boob in slot) this maps WHERE the tumours/differences are in the boob using an algorithm which can identify normal, dense, fatty tissue and discount them  to show only the solid lesions. You will also see the shape of the tumour/s leading to better surgical excision/s I suspect. This will replace mamms so that no longer will we be clamped in a machine and have ionised radiation. That\u2019s all for now. Take care everyone. As usual Love to all.",

I was happily going down the route of \u201cslice and burn\u201d when I was told that a 6cm lumpectomy would be the slice (this is almost the size of a tennis ball)!  Even though a date was set for the op I had to cancel.  I felt I was being propelled into it both by the \u2018team\u2019 and family.  All were \u2018for it\u2019 and \u2018doing it in my interests\u2019 but I just could not commit. In checking out websites I find that most of the blogs are to do with secondary cancers and I am more than ever nervous at being cut.  I have however given myself a month to check out other therapies to settle my mind.  I would dearly love to talk to ladies who have been in the same predicament.

      "Content": "Hi All Consult done.  Measurement they say is 7.8mm (depth) x 6.1mm (width) so partial response to Letrozole.  Waited 2 hours 15 minutes for that!  Head Consultant's list had extended to that long so was seen by another doctor - a nice young one!  We had a chat, he copped a feel of the tumour and the lymph node and we then talked again.  He saw the note about my polyps and wanted to refer me to another doctor with a view to having my gallbladder out!  No thanks I said.  It ain't bothering me, I'll think about this if it does!  Sister who came with me likes the this doctor - not the wrong way ladies!  As he was looking at the whole of my case, I think she felt that rather than concentrating on the one thing - the cancer - he was also looking at my whole health which she liked. Anyway, booked appointments for August for US and a mammogramme.  Yes, a mammogramme.  I think I need to see what's going on as well.  Last one on my right boob was 8 May 2014 - stuck to US only to monitor.  The left one had a mamm on 21 November 2014 when I felt a lump there - it was only a cyst.  Consult has been booked for after these scans.  Got it the right way round this time!!!!!!! On the point about waiting for 2 hrs 15 mins, I did notice that 2 ladies had very long consults with 1 lady's daughter, I suppose, accompanying her.  She kept coming back after the consult asking questions of the nurses on duty.  I can only assume that our ranks are swelling.... Other than that, my cyber love to you all and sending hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hiya Ladies (and Gents) Well, tomorrow I have my mamms and Ultrasound.  Must remember to make sure that the mamm radiographers don't squash me hard. I really will do mischief to them if they do!!!!! On another note have suffered a minor stroke.  Lost the vision in my right eye - a right (eye) retinal artery occlusion.  However  sight does seem to be coming back - although slowly - as my body starts to find new pathways to correct the problem. This was down to high blood pressure - readings ranging from 213/102 to 197/98 - which I had said was not the cause but obviously it was!  What do I know!  On BP tablets of course and seems because I had been slipping on my diet I am back on the statins.  Spent 12 hours at the hospital as they did an eye scan, and due to the high blood pressure also said I should have blood test, as well as go to Casualty to be given urgent treatment - Amlopidine for the BP.  Didn't work.  Thoughts were to take me into hospital but eventually let me go home with prescription for Ramipril and Clopidogrel.  The sroke was just in the eye, nowhere else.  Lucky!!!!!!!! On 20th July was seen by the Stroke Unit where I had ultrasound of arteries in neck - all okay, MRI of head - no evidence of any stroke in the brain (that's if I have one!!!!) past or present and an electrocardiogram - lady consultant was highly delighted with this one.  Diet: No Red Meat, No Dairy, No Salt.  Consultant wants my Cholesterol to go down from 6.1 to 4.0 with the LDL's less that 2.0 which at the time of the blood test were 3.3. Now as if I haven't got enough to deal with!!!!!!!!  But let this be a warning to all not to discount high BP readings.  I felt perfectly fine and healthy but as with BC there is another silent predator in the wings.  Will come back with update on the mamms, US and consult when all complete. Love to you all.",

      "Content": "Hi Skylight Thank you for asking.  Had the mamms on both boobs.  Was really only interested in the right boob so didn't ask to see the left boob mamms.  From the quick glance I saw of both craniocordal and mediolateral scans on the right boob most of the microcalcifications and calcifications have gone.  Couldn't see the lymph node with cancer as at this size - .33mm - they don't often get seen, radiographer said.  Original site of the tumour still there with ductal signs of it - hence the 7.8mm x 6.2mm size.  It is never seen as a 'lump' per se but as an 'erupting volcano' with 'lava sliding down it'.  You can sometimes see these on mamm pictures on the internet.  Additionally had the setting on the lowest (lightest) - which was 3 - which you need to get any proper definition of the mamms (otherwise they will be blurred, asked the lady radiographer on this).  I didn't feel as if I was 'clamped' hard just slightly 'pressured'.  I'm just not sure whether mamms on maximum setting would give any clearer pictures!  To me, on my quick glance I think I am doing bl..dy good!  Thanked the lass for being so considerate. Ultrasound - angle of the screen did not allow me to see what she saw.  However I can do a good thorough check once I order copies of the scans and pay for them.  Had a good chat whilst she was working.  Constant interruptions from people coming in though.  Was a lengthy US as a result.  Radiographer said scans showed - as she put it - 'vague' pictures.  Didn't ask her to clarify...  She looked up my old scans for confirmation of where it is!  She also had a look at an area just outside the armpit at the top towards the right boob where my old bra had pinched and caused me pain and inflammation.  Unknown as to what she thought of that or what she will report.  You could say that I am clinging on to the 'vague' bit she quoted from the US but from the clearness of microcalcs and calcs on the mammogramme I am fairly hopeful for my consult on the 17th. Will come back on that after the consult.  All my love and support to everyone on this rollercoaster.",

      "Content": "So!  Why a second post? Well, after the February consult debacle I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING MYSELF.  It took a bit of time to get sorted but I have had the Sono Photodynamic Therapy, privately, in the UK in April.  Yes Ladies, I have.  Self empowerment is a brilliant feeling. The course covered 2 weeks.  The first Monday was to give a bit of blood for an ordinary blood test but also some to be sent off to Greece for an OncoTrace.  This OncoTrace determines what enzymes are causing my cancer and takes up to 3 weeks to come back.  A new OncoTrace is set for September when I have my next consult at the clinic.  We then had to get the photosensitizer, Sonnolux-1, into my system.  This is done through a dropper under the tongue and took 1 hour to achieve \u2013 only a small bottle, and it makes your tongue blue!  For one lady it took 5 hours, but then I was asked to come thirsty and no food, so early appointment, for it to soak in.  We then had a look around the treatment room which contains both the Photodynamic equipment and the Sono.  The Photodynamic is delivered through a far infra red bed \u2013 a bit like a suntan bed, you wear goggles.  The Sono is delivered by your standard sonograph machine that is already used for zapping those pesky kidney stones, etc.  After a cup of my green tea I was able to leave.  (After Friday\u2019s treatment I left clutching another bottle of Sonnelux-1 to be taken the following Monday at home.  I took this after I woke up before any breakfast or drink.  It is absorbed better and quicker this way.)  It takes 48-72 hours to \u2018attach itself\u2019 to cancer. Wednesday, Thursday and Fridays\u2019 (nothing Tuesdays) were devoted to the Sono Photodynamic treatment over the next 2 weeks.  The treatment times for this increased each day.  1st Wednesday was 5 minutes, 5 min. break, then another 5 mins under the light being emitted onto my body even underneath with my right arm above my head and you do this totally stark naked!  You are then moved to a couch when the Nurse uses the Sono machine and gives you 5 mins on the boob and, in my case, 5 mins on the axilla with a 5 min break in between.  The Sono treatment stays the same for all treatment days.  1st Thursday was 8 mins light, 8 mins rest, then 8 mins again under the light.  1st Friday was for 10 mins light, 10 mins rest, 10 mins light.  2nd Wednesday was 12 mins light, 12 mins rest, 12 mins light, 2nd Thursday and Friday saw us reach 15 mins light, 15 mins rest, 15 mins light. Nurse is with you at all times.  You can chat with her or \u2018contemplate your navel\u2019 if you want.  I found that chatting away to the nurse made the time go quicker. Prior to each treatment day we had Ozone Therapy.  This means taking some of your blood into a bag which already contains the Ozone.  Your blood drips down into the bag, set down lower than your heart, and when enough is taken, about 50mls, the bag is then raised to drip back into you.  It is absolutely amazing just how red your blood becomes from the ozone.  I asked if I was going to get \u2018high\u2019 on this.  I had read that having hyperbaric oxygen can give you a \u2018good\u2019 feeling so was hoping for something like this.  Not to be for me.  One lady they said DID get high.  Tumours tend to be hypoxic (lacking in oxygen) so the effectiveness of the SPDT treatment is IMPROVED. Now to side effects.  You WILL get inflammation and can last between 4-12 weeks.  This is as a result of the dead tumour/s being attacked by your immune system as it mops up those dead cells.  The Sono zaps any cells deeper within the tissue, supposedly up to 12cm deep.  From this you can get pain for which Dexamethasone (a low dose steroidal anti-inflammatory) is given to you.  I only experienced a few gripes in the early days after treatment.  However when my right breast nipple and areolar went white they recommended I start the Dex.  I carried a card for this drug but after about 2 weeks I had to be weaned off it.  You cannot just stop this medication but it only takes 1 week to do so by taking the drug on alternate days.  So, what are the physical effects on me.  My right boob is a bit mis-shapen from the inflammation.  I have an elongated egg-shaped slight bulge at the 9pm position and a bit of dimpling which I never had before \u2013 very likely due to the bulge.  Lately I have had a few sharp pains in various places though not too uncomfortable.  Therefore the inflammation is still resolving nearly 2 months (8 weeks) after the treatment has finished.  The bulge has a central area which \u2018feels\u2019 hard and I have assumed that this is now \u2018scar\u2019 tissue which in the early days had about a two inch \u2018hard\u2019 feel to it but which has reduced since then \u2013 just checked my boobie!!!!!  \u2018Think\u2019 I can now feel my primary due to the inflammation which I have never been able to do.  It is recommended that any scans are not done for 12 weeks (3 months) as a false positive could be indicated. When the hospital MDT team told me they wanted to do an MRI instead of the Ultrasound I sought out another private clinic who could do this.  Having had this done I can report that she couldn\u2019t see the tumour/s.  Additionally, and crucially, she found no blood supply to the tumour/s.  There is, however, an area in the axilla that looks like a \u2018black hole\u2019 which needs further investigation.  We\u2019ll also see what the MRI will bring up when done. So there you have it \u2013 chapter and verse.  Comments welcome.  As always, love and hugs to everyone on this journey. [edited]",

      "Content": "Thanks to KateG and Sacha Rose for comments. Cancer is oestrogen receptive and could take Tamoxifen, if necessary, pre-op.  Still looking on web and two good therapies have come to light, Hyperthermia and Photodynamic - the latter looking very encouraging.  Only problem I don't think they have been used on patients in the first instance.  I am still dithering and the kind sentiments of copy letters I receive from the consultant to my doctor make me, only sometimes, lean towards surgery.  The negative effects of conventional treatment are definitely not for me! (and I say that with tongue in cheek).  It does seem that yes it does work but only after you have gone through the mill with the treatment.  Not happy with future expected outcomes though. In the meantime, looking after health, diet and exercise (more than usual).  Funny thing though, just today I felt the area of my breast (still cant feel the lumps) and it felt cool!!!! Going to sit and watch TV now with heat pad on the area!",

      "Content": "Hi All Now had the hyperbaric oxygen. In the chamber with 3 other new ladies and 2 old hands \u2013 capacity 6. Can\u2019t say that I feel any different. However as with anything, I was told afterwards you cant expect too much from the first outing. You need to carry on. Initially they said to do 15 sessions over 3 weeks, daily basis. One lady came out of the chamber before I went in. She says that she can \u2018feel\u2019 its effects straight away but then that lady did have MS and she goes every week. She also says that she does \u2018miss it\u2019 when she doesn\u2019t get her weekly \u2018imbibe\u2019 of oxygen. Her session was at 24 feet. After a small chat on safety I was given an oxygen mask. Deposit for this is £25. If you decide to stop taking the hyperbaric oxygen this deposit is returned to you. Session for the oxygen is £30 for private patients who don\u2019t have MS. No shoes allowed in the chamber but luckily had socks on. It is said that bare feet can get cold. I took my watch off (didn\u2019t have to) and left handbag outside in care of operator \u2013 everyone did. Took some magazines into the chamber they had available to read. Also took a washing up bowl which you turn upside down to rest your feet on. Some of the chairs can be a bit high which leave your feet dangling. For bare legs there were blankets available. You are locked in, have the oxygen face masks on and we start pressurizing. Found the mask to be a bit heavy on my nose but coped. We get up to 8 ft when the operator advises that he is now about to send us up to 16.5 ft. At this point the 2 \u2018old hands\u2019 put their masks on!! They like to chat you see! Except for the noise from the pressurising we are quiet. When we get to 16.5 ft we are either reading books on our iphones/book or like me reading the magazines. The longer you keep your mask on the better to get pure oxygen. Chatting is hard through the mask! Phone usage \u2013 no signal but there is internet access. After an hour at this pressure he starts to depressurise the chamber. We then finish and exit. I did have a couple of coughs during the oxygen and had to remove my mask. I found that I was constantly breathing through my mouth. It may be how first timers respond to having the mask on. I did try to breathe through my nose but kept going back to mouth breathing. This could have dried my airways so I ended up coughing. Back out of the chamber I had a quick coffee for which you donate money. I then paid my bill, talked a while to an MS patient who also had had cancer and left for home. Didn\u2019t get back until 2.50pm. I\u2019m definitely booked for 16 August but 9 August was fully booked. I am however on the waiting list for the 9th August session should there be a cancellation. See how I feel at the next one. I had hoped to have a \u2018euphoric\u2019 feeling but not to be. Love and virtual hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi there ladies Just returned to the website and thought I should update you. Well I'm still here.  Have been on the Anastrozole since 31 Oct .  Correction to first blog - it is only one tumour not three.  Dimensions were 13 x 7 x 21mm.  In April 2013 they measured 7 x 5 x 6mm - reduced from taking the Anastrozole? and I put a question mark here because as you are aware from the thread I have been trying other ways in which to try to deal with the cancer.  Lymph nodes still clear from US's done. This tumour is now under 1cm all round.  I had a further US 2 weeks ago and will be going back to the consultant on 1 August for those results.  US technician seemed to think it was almost the same (I am hoping there has been a further reduction if only a small one!).  I hope her comment was less than the truth!!!!! I did get my second opinion and am now under that consultant.  I am very happy that he chose to continue with my lead - more than likely he hoped I would be changing my mind!!!!  I did state that I hadn't totally discounted surgery but I did think that taking away 6cm of breast tissue was a little excessive (only 0.27mm short of the size of a tennis ball - if its a ball size lump they will take away) from the initial measurements first taken last year.  I wasn't enamoured of my first oncologist.  We had no rapport or understanding of each other - possibly going mob-handed with two sisters in tow could have unnerved her!! Strangely, with all the other complementary therapies I am taking I am feeling extremely well.  I have no side-effects from the Anastozole, have only had one or two headaches, I have no indigestion at all which was driving me mad, a radical change of diet and with the good news of the reduction in tumour size I also have a positive outlook.  I do hope this is not the calm before the storm....... But everything is still noted in my head and I will report back to you all after my meeting with the consultant on Thursday. In the meantime I have been reading up on blogs since last November when I first wrote and I commiserate with, and support all the ladies who have been given the devastating BC diagnosis.  I do urge you to do the research and ASK LOADS OF QUESTIONS.  I have a long list (still) for Thursday. Love to every one of you",

Had my MRI on Sunday 29 December at 6pm at a mobile MRI unit - YES on a Sunday.  Laid on my back this time rather than on the stomach for breast MRIs!  Go back to get results from the Bone Consultant on 9 January. Additionally have my check up with Breast Cancer Consultant same day.  Will advise the Breast Cancer Care Nurse before then of this additional bit of news and ask if they want to do any more tests before we meet.  Need to be updated anyway on the ultrasound I had done on 4 October 2013...... Health still good.  Constantly, it seems, I keep trying to 'feel' the tumour.  Sometimes I think I can but other times not.  Could I even be feeling the titanium clip they have put in??????  Will get back to you after the consults Still fighting this nasty little critter...... ",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies Petina - I got my histology copy on the tumour when I was organising the surgery (which I didn't go for in the end).  I asked for a copy and was given it.  All the other bits I have paid for.  One hospital was £50 and the current one is £20 for the block of scans each time.  They burn them to a disk and send to my home.  At the moment I am awaiting the reports which are from a different department and will get a letter telling me how much.  Should only be a couple of pounds and to me this is well worth the money.  I feel the more I understand the more I can be involved in my own treatment IF I should choose to go down the conventional route but this will only come after trying the Photodynamic Therapy.  I am hoping that the 2nd or 3rd trial at my hospital, and I fit the criteria, will not contain the necessity of lopping off the boob after treatment.  It takes time though to go through these trials, and money of course.  I do have a private clinic in reserve that does the Sono Photodynamic Therapy. MaryQ - good for you on your decision to not have radiotherapy.  This is a choice that all women have to make.  Some will have it, some will not.  Those decisions will be based on what knowledge they have gained and how this treatment could affect them.  I think we are rapidly coming to a time when most women want to know what the hell is going on.  I know my surgeon/oncologist on consultation days has an enormously busy day ahead of him.  I plan all of the questions I want to ask but try not to overstay my welcome.  I can find more information on it from the internet.  I asked if they would continue to monitor me and they agreed.  You can be sure that if anything changes considerably I will be taking action.  Just not prepared for the slash, bash and burn approach which has been extolled for decades and decades and which I believe to be outdated otherwise why would so many new potential treatments be undergoing research with some excellent initial results in the labs! I'm not brave just not ready to take the first thing that's offered... Love and hugs to everyone ... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

Had the results from bone guy on 9 January and MRI confirms X-ray.  He\u2019s not recommending any treatment but suggested I did some swimming as exercise rather than the light jogging I was intending to do.  He wants me to build up my muscles!!!!  Also had the results of 4 October 2013 US the same day at my other hospital.  They say that \u2018it\u2019 has increased from 11mm to 12mm - pardon!!!!!!  I didn\u2019t even know it had increased to 11mm!!!!!   So I decided to check the reports and digital pictures (I paid for these) plus the copy letters to my GP and I can\u2019t find this measurement anywhere!!  Previous US was on 18 July 2013 where the supposed 11mm has come from but I was told verbally and in a letter to my GP that the tumour was 5x5x7mm!!  On the 4th October US, verbally heard the radiologist (I think he was head radiologist - previous US were done by a very nice lady) said, whilst dictating, 12mm so there could be some correlation to the new measurement but I would have thought they would have told me it had grown, substantially, but they didn\u2019t!  OR, are they be referring to the micro-calcifications which they said was 18x5mm on the 18 July 2013 at the 7-9 o\u2019clock position - but they didn\u2019t.  It was the Registrar at the appointment on the 9th who advised me of this new measurement not the consultant/oncologist.  Now that I have checked all my records will have to give them a ring to get this inconsistency resolved.  Have been naughty with my diet and have eaten far too much red meat!  Stopped that now and plumping for the vegetables and fruit.  Can have fresh fish and free-range chicken.  Drink only green tea with honey in.  Do have an occasional \u2018drink\u2019 but may be exaggerating if I said I only have 1 glass a fortnight.  Still healthy (except for the BC) other than a \u2018catarrhy\u2019 chest - always get this in winter.  My thoughts are with you all  still dealing with this nasty little critter.....",

Received in the post a Breast Cancer Screening letter for an appointment 21 May.  As you are aware I haven't had the conventional treatment but am on the endocrine therapy - still.  Now I didn't expect this appointment as I thought as I was still under hospital care!  I meant to ring the screening people to cancel and tell them this but they actually rang me on the day.  Seems that the mamm machine had broken down.  They couldn't take my cancellation over the phone and said they would be sending me another appointment letter!!  I can then return it to say no. Seems one hand doesn't know what the other one is doing!!!  Anyone else getting screening letters 3 years down the line? ...... still fighting this nasty little critter ....",

In talking with him I learnt that as I still get the hot flushes the Anastrozole is working!  Now I didn't know that!!!!!!! On the Photodynamic trial front - sorry news - only 10 ladies have signed up when they need 30 for the first part.  However the consultant is trying to get the trial re-configured so that ladies with DCIS type cancer can be brought on board who would only require a lumpectomy afterwards but this is proving very difficult.  Probably NICE being absolute berks!

Serum triglyceride levels above range at 2.26 (normal range is between 0.0-1.8) Alkaline phosphatase level above range at 194 (normal range is between 30-130) GP talked about this last one as it is to do with the liver!  Yikes!!!  Have I got some metasteses!!!  Or could it be down to my being an extremely naughty girl by not sticking to my healthy diet.  I own up to the fact that I haven't eaten many greens or fruit lately and have plumped for eating red meat!  Now that I know I can make the adjustments and get back on track. The middle 'above range' one is to do with the cholesterol although the reading that came back for that was 4.0 which is good, I think.  However I have been eating some chips lately so will knock them completely on the head.

      "Content": "Hi All Heather - in trying to find out why doctors prescribe either Anastrozole or Letrozole I came across a paper in the British Journal of Cancer.  Simply, Letrozole works 99% effectively on eostrodiols, etc (suppressing these 'enzymes' slows/kills off cancer cells) whilst Anastrozole is only 90% - hence the difference in side effects between the two, possibly.  It also says that the doctors choose which inhibitor a patient has - possibly based on the 'aggressiveness' of the cancer in the patient OR just what they describe.  It is also possible that as you were 'contemplating' surgery at the time that this would have significantly reduced the tumour to ensure only a small lumpectomy would be needed.  You don't say if you are also having the Sentinel Node excision which seems, always, to accompany the lumpectomy.  As to the radiotherapy the decision will be yours. In researching what inhibitor we are prescribed I came across Triazole which is an anti-fungal drug.  I think our aromatase inhibitors stem from this and gives a little credence that possibly some cancers or cancer stems from a fungus (which one doctor I read about seems to think that is what cancer is) which may have triggered cancer cells to form.  With time I imagine more research will actually identify why cancers are formed.  In the meantime making sure you eat the right foods (or supplementing - with resveratrol and other items) will help to keep your immune system actively working for you as well as being physically active. Lulubel - when I read of your recurrence being egg-sized I actually said Yeowww.  Bl***y h*ll !!!  So sorry to hear of this.  I checked up on your Salvestrols and as you are aware these are a big part of my regimen.  I am now having fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries on top of my 50% fruit muesli.  Along with the unsweetened almond milk its a really good breakfast.  Someone said that eating fruit for breakfast was the best time as it won't be sitting on top of previously eaten food and so not 'ferment' in the stomach - although I do still eat fruit during the day!  Love my greens as well which also provide the salvestrols. Heather says to get a second opinion and I think this is right if your surgeon will not commit to a double mastectomy.  It's so logical to only have one operation but I note that you say it takes 10 hours to do a mastectomy for only one breast!  It actually only takes between 2-3 hours but will take longer if having reconstruction.  When reading up on the mastectomy surgery it is critical that you have a good support network following surgery if you go down this line.  Arm movement will be severely compromised thus limiting your ability to care for yourself.  With only one mastectomy at least you would have one arm free to do things.  Another lady on this site wanted to have a double as well.  She decided to only have only the one boob off in the end as the other was still healthy.  BUT as you know I am a lady who believes in the individuals' right to make their own decision on their health care and will go with your 'flow'. My love and positive vibes to both of you. .... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

I wanted to know where my 2 affected lymph nodes are physically located and the computer records just do not show it! Unbelievable or what!!! They quote them so often to me yet can\u2019t identify WHERE they are. As a result I am having an US again and this time I will ensure they tell me where they are.  Just awaiting the appointment letter. This all came about as I have a \u2018lump\u2019 (but lessening now) right in the crease of my right armpit. I think this had been a cyst which got infected (as it had oozed pus) but ironically has left a hard \u2018bit\u2019. I just wanted to be reassured that my assumption was the case. They couldn\u2019t answer. They did have a look though and it is somewhat smaller than yesterday. On Tuesday I had to attend a funeral and what with all the \u2018chatting\u2019 that went on after the committal, before the wake, I ended up with a bit of an ache in my back on the Wednesday. They were more interested in this probably surmising that I could have metastatic bone cancer. But I told them no (I do know my body) and they have asked that I keep an eye on it. They did touch me in a certain area but no pain came as a result. As I write it is resolving itself. Hat\u2019s off to them for their concern though. So I have another appointment on 1 November at 11.45am with another blood test. I will report back after that. For the first month of this treatment they see you every 2 weeks. After that it would be in a month. I think after that it is every 3 months but as you know we are not always told everything up front. Sigh\u2026\u2026..",

Great explanation for the Everolimus as I had since found out that it was an immunosuppressant! which didn't make sense. (Everolimus works by interfering with the action of certain enzymes in your body called mTOR kinases. These enzymes help both healthy cells and cancer cells to grow and multiply. When kinases don\u2019t act normally, they make cancers and tumours grow out of control. Everolimus inhibits mTOR kinases and stops the tumour or cancer from growing. This prevents the spread of the cancer or tumour in your body. Love to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi All Started re-taking the exemestane and everolimus on 29 November. Not taking the Lemon Mucilage as I haven\u2019t been experiencing the mouth ulcers they seem to think is the most common side effect. I do however still keep taking my Corsodyl mouthwash and mouth is doing fine. Hives on arms resolved and sores/dry skin on hands also. Feet still peeling but no new hard skin forming. Dosage \u2013 exemestane 1 x 25mg tablet daily, everolimus \u2013 1 x 5mg tablet every 2 days. Experiencing prickling and itching in the hands but dealing with this with hand cream and when the itching is maddening \u2013 Lanacane. Oncologist appointment on Wednesday 6 December. 2 out of the 4 doctors did not turn up! Had to wait 3 and half hours to see the consultant. My appointment was for 12.15pm and I didn\u2019t get in until 3.40pm! Still got a cough so asked if I could have a CT scan to rule out lung lesions. Would have been nice if she had readily agreed but I had to insist just to make sure. Awaiting an appointment to come through the door. I am to continue with the above dosage until next appointment which is on 3 January 2018 due to the side effects I have experienced. Overall we were in or near the hospital for 8 hours!!!! Ordered the reports from the blood tests taken and will order copies of outstanding scans once I have had the ultrasound on 9 January 2018. Now have in place my heart monitor which I wear all the time except when I take a shower. The plaster/ed contacts to the monitor give me the itch! Wonder what is recorded when I scratch them!!!! This comes off on Wednesday (13th) when I have to take it back for the data to be downloaded. Other than the above I am truly okay. If I don\u2019t come back before then I wish everyone a wonderful Christmas and a very Merry New Year.",

      "Content": "Hi All Marlog - Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Situ is DCIS that has broken out of the duct before being spotted.  If it is contained within the duct I assume this has a slightly better outcome as it should be easier to get out with surgery. From what I can gather RFA can be placed into all tumours at the same time so if you have 2 or 3 or however many they will treat them all in one go.  By chance I did see that my hospital does have RFA but not for breast cancer.  A question I will pose to the consultant tomorrow.  It may need clearance from NICE for it to be performed on the breast. I forgot to say in my last piece that I may be put onto Letrozole as it could be that the Anastrozole may not be working any longer.  I'll give Letrozole a try and see how I do given the increased side effects I have read that this brings. Many thanks to all others who have posted.  It is always nice to have someone comment back.  You don't feel alone when things turn an unexpected corner despite having  sister/s who makes the time to come along with me for every consultation. Here's hoping for the best tomorrow ... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

      "Content": "Hi DEM Left you a private message for you to read.  Just wanted to say on this discussion that I hope you are still okay from your Herceptin injection.  Sometimes we do get ourselves so het up about a treatment by reading up on it that it can affect our perceptions.  The relief that it's not that bad is monumental.  I had that when they did a CT scan for my bone and putting in radioactive stuff.  I grilled them mercilessly about it.  Having been told that it has a half 'shelf' life of 6 hours, the next 6 hours another half 'shelf' life and so on, it was going to be 'out of me' within 24 to 48 hours but it did screw with my head, I tell you!  AND all this radioactive stuff goes into the sewerage system which is then treated to return back as drinking water.  O Oh!!! I also think we have to be truly compus mentis when having treatment - as you have found out yourself.  Not found any evidence to the contrary but I wonder how many wrong boobies have been operated on.... Talk soon - stay well - keep your wits about you - love and hugs ... still fighting this nasty little critter",

Cost to fix £250.  Still the gas engineer did say I had a good boiler.  He definitely knew his 'onions'.  British Gas wanted me to invest in a new boiler at a cost of £4000 when I took up a their 'care' package about 3 years ago.  Needless to say I didn't take them up on their offer!!!! and stopped wasting my money in March of this year on the care package.  Anyway cancer is still there as a small red blob. Also had my appointment with oncologist.  Got a new guy this time and do I like him YES YES YES.  He's Polish and we hit it right off.  I would say he is in his 60s.  Have to book ultrasounds and am contemplating mammogrammes on both left and right - he was that charming.  He did a thorough examination of both boobs asking me to sit up while he checked, as well as lay down, and told me straight that he felt the cyst in the left and could feel the tumour in the right - although I still cant - and that there is still no lymph node involvement.  To say I am pleased as punch is an understatement!!!! Will get back to you when I have results of US and - if I do - the mamms. ... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

      "Content": "Hi all Had my oncology consult today before next cycle. Bloods done so that results could come back for the consult. All good, so can go ahead with Cycle/dose 2 of EC on 12 October. The 1st one was at a reduced dose, the 2nd cycle will now be the standard dose but may bring further side effects with it. Will deal with that if it happens. Now got some laxatives on prescription to deal with the eventuality of constipation again after Cycle/dose 2 alongside taking the anti-emetics. Oncologist \u2018feels\u2019 that boob has done well off the first cycle. Boob has reduced in size and the area surrounding the lesions have become softer. The MRI for the breast I had done on 21 September has come back with an anomaly in the liver. When having the breast MRI it can sometimes pick up on the top of the liver and it is this top area of the liver that has this anomaly. They can\u2019t say what it is so I have to undertake a whole body CT and an MRI again. Here\u2019s hoping it is not metastatic and just a distortion bug in the MRI images. Shedding hair like a good \u2018un. Woke up to find lots of individual hairs on the pillow. Loads came out in the shower today, sticking to my hands, body, etc. Found two sizable clumps at my feet!  I laughed when trying to cover the bald areas with what hair is left (after drying and losing more hair) \u2013 I found more bald spots!  Oops.  And my sister thought I could go out of the door looking like that!!!!!! Haven\u2019t taken the plunge to shave it short, yet. Relying on some being saved so I have a semblance of hair under the beany hat! Will only know the end result of hair loss when it happens. Curiously when in the waiting room for the oncologist consult I noticed the ladies wearing scarves! Really hadn\u2019t noticed them before. Weird, eh! Watch out for more bulletins!!!!! Love and hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, and gents Well it is Day 5 of Cycle 2. Still shedding hair \u2013 haven\u2019t had the cut. Funnily enough I had it on my TO DO list for a hair cut before I started losing hair \u2013 don\u2019t need it now! Hair loss started like a Friar Tuck! Has now extended down the back of my head and into the sides. Thinning like a good \u2018un overall but I STILL HAVE FRINGE, AROUND THE SIDES AND THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK so when I put my hats on (which I have now received) I still look semi-normal except for the fact I could look like a \u2018mad woman\u2019 walking around in this weather with a hat on! Sister likes the hats I have chosen so one good thing. Some tough little hair beggars hanging on in the bald areas \u2013 would you credit it. Only small amount of hairs found on pillow now \u2013 wonder why! Wear a hair net on me head to minimise shedding everywhere and always have a hat by my side if anyone calls at the front door! Gave fringe a very small trim yesterday. NB \u2013 1st cycle it turned out was the standard dose \u2013 150mg - not the 75mg/M2 reduced dose. Not what I was told at oncology consult nor has my booklet been updated! Will bring this to oncologist attention. Next chemo cycle 2 November 2018. \u2018The C Word\u2019 came up on another TV channel which I almost watched again, fully (fell asleep for goodness sake) but not before I watched the part where Sheridan Smith/Lisa Lynch hadn\u2019t washed her hair for 2 weeks! When she did most of it had come out in the wash. When washing my hair I was getting loads out and all over my hands so haven\u2019t been washing it as regularly. WILL wash it tomorrow though. I\u2019m putting all my hair loss into a jug for time being until it does all fall out \u2013 if it does. Healthwise \u2013 I am good. None of the expected side effects from chemo. Haven\u2019t had a motion today! This is because I had a normal motion on Saturday morning but I did take the Movicol (mild laxative) on Saturday morning and had an explosive diarrhoea poo later on! Had a smaller motion a couple of hours later. Sorry to be so blunt on this but this is something I thought you might want to know with this medication so I didn\u2019t take any more Movicol on successive days. I did go normally Monday so really not so long between \u2018normal\u2019. So today at 1pm have taken the Movicol and NOTHING! Will do another one this evening, maybe \u2013 2 a day they prescribe. A little shaky when I get up in the mornings but this soon disappears when I walk about. Tomorrow I have a CT scan to see what\u2019s happening in the liver, mainly, but it is all a whole body scan. Wonder if I can keep my hat on! Will choose one that doesn\u2019t have any metal or plastic adornment. MRI booked for 24 October. THEN we shall see what\u2019s going on inside me. Boob \u2013 still some aches as tumour/s pull on normal breast skin. Dexamethasone helping here but I take the last one today. See how we go. Have noticed some nodules appearing when feeling the boob just under Lesion 1 and in the crease area below the boob. Don\u2019t know what they are and just wondering what they could be! Doc aware of 5 nodules on crease below boob which is why I am having the scans as well. I don\u2019t think there is much difference in the boob from the end of Cycle 1! AND the appearance of the nodules a bit worrying. Still the CT scan tomorrow and the MRI next week will say what they are. Next consult 31 October to get answers. Other than the above, that\u2019s all I am experiencing with chemo. Don\u2019t like losing my hair but resigned to it. Watch for more bulletins. Love and hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hiya Girls Just a short update.  Stumbled on the stairs on Friday and in grabbing hold of the bannister (to stop me from a fate worse than death) I bashed my little finger on the right hand.  Heard a crack and once downstairs trying to recover my finger hurt like hell.  Thought I had just 'cracked' my knuckle as some annoying so and so's tend to do - I bet they get arthritis when they're older..... Immediately put finger under cold water to stop swelling and headed off to A&E.  Yep, fractured the bone closest to the palm - now in a splint and taking Ibuprofen - just in case.  Asked them to double check my bone density there and all seems okay as well.  What a relief.  However because of the location of the fracture which is in the middle of this bone and no fractures near the joints (which is good they say) it's going to take 6 weeks to heal fully.  Sheesh, panic over and getting on with life as best I can.  Provided I don't knock it seems okay most of the time.  Never fractured a bone before - could I be lucky!!!

      "Content": "Well people, had an \u2018incident\u2019. Got up to go for wee 12.50am Tuesday night/Wednesday morning ostensibly to go to bed afterwards. Did the wee and sorted out my clothing. All of a sudden I was shaking violently in the legs, body and arms, was unable to continue to stand and had to plop back down on the loo. When I \u2018felt\u2019 I could get up again I fell onto my knees. I tried to get up again when I felt I could but again I fell sideways onto my back and just laid there, still shaking. I stayed there for a while still shaking but calming down. This took almost 20 minutes overall. Was able to get up and finally go into bedroom. Sat there trying to take stock. Didn\u2019t know what to do! Thought I should ring ambulance or chemo nurse but where was my card \u2013 in my purse downstairs. So downstairs I went. Rang chemo nurse. They couldn\u2019t say what happened. Will get back to me. Came back and said I need to go to A+E. Rang my sister to take me. She arrived 1.45am. Packed a bag just in case but had to go up and downstairs to get things. Tiring. Arrived hospital and taken straight in. Blood tests \u2013 neutrophils reading 22, urine test was normal which I cocked up first time trying to give, drink water, and finally went and achieved the sample, ECG, chest X-ray. All came back normal. Had a drip of plasma to make me \u2018go\u2019 but water was the best. They were going to give another infusion of drugs for urine infection but this wasn\u2019t needed as it turned out clear for this. Left the hospital at 6am for home, finally. No treatment needed. So what was all that about!!!!! Was as weak as a kitten next day and wasn\u2019t fit to get to hospital for CT so rang and cancelled but organised to have CT on day of MRI scan. Spent most of the day in bed sleeping. Today I managed to get a shower and washed my hair, still losing it. Still trying to get back to normal \u2013 whatever that is now! Absolutely shattered and have no sparkle. Staying close to home. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I recall a scene from The C Word where Lisa/Sheridan couldn\u2019t get out of the bath! You watch/learn things but you really don\u2019t truly take it in until it happens to you. What a gift this chemo is!!!!!! Boob \u2013 has been hurting since. Taking the Paracetamol daily which is stopping this but how long can I take it for? Chemo nurse says to take it when it hurts! Just what is happening there? So many questions! Rang yesterday the chemo nurse about the Filgrastim injections I should be taking every evening. They say not the cause of the collapse BUT it happened 1 hour afterwards Tuesday night. I quoted the 22 count for neutrophils. We agreed not to take the Filgrastim until they could get the results from the A&E I attended. Supposed to call me today \u2013 no sign yet. Love to you all.",

      "Content": "Hello to everyone who has posted Many thanks for that.  Looked into numerous diets and mechanical aids all of which were out of my price range requiring, for better outcomes, a trip abroad.  Although, the new 'equipment' on the Budwig Protocol seems a lot more reasonable in price - she says!  What we are not getting are alternative therapies that can really assist us.  Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy alone could do so much as a conventional cancer therapy but are we offered it - No.  Does it cost a lot - very probably not.  Chemo drugs - expensive - oh yes.  HIFU (High Frequency Focussed Ultrasound) being used but not on Breast Cancer.  Can it be used for BC - of course.  Photodynamic Therapy - I think - absolutely brilliant and can be used as many times as it is needed should there be a recurrence AND of course no side effects - like loss of some anatomy, scarring and the mental anguish at the loss of an important part of our anatomy.  Ablatherm is another one.  Nanoknife all the rage in America which delivers electrical pulses at the tumour - kills them - just like a part of the Budwig protocol.  So many with clinical trials/studies behind them and some even without the Phase 3 Clinical Trial.  Most being used elsewhere but not in the UK.  Some are being used in the UK but not being used for BC.  We are, really, so backward in the UK. On the sight front - eyesight slowly, slowly returning.  Checking everyday and only see marginal improvements.  From 18 July, however, I suppose there is a marked improvement but oh how I wish it was all back right here and now.  The 'lace' effect still in effect! Blood Pressure - last one was 147/78 - a remarkable improvement.  Next one due on 17 August in the morning before I go off to see the consultant in the afternoon. Cholesterol test shows 4.0 with HDL's (good) at 3.3.  I am now wondering if a sandwich I ate with ham and cheese was the cause of that (at the time) as I am not allowed to eat dairy, red meat or salt which that sandwich all contained!!!!!! Finally, going away for a long weekend this weekend.  Looking forward to it as it is beside the seaside.  Good lungfuls of fresh air from the Westerlies and it's going to be sunny'ish. Take care of yourselves everyone and will be back after the consult.",

      "Content": "Hi All Now I am totally confused. The original tumour still there. Now say it is 11x9mm so obviously Letrozole not working.  Bring on the Arimidex. They now say that the tumour in the lymph node is in the ARMPIT not at the edge of the breast!!!!! Also they have \u2018found\u2019 another area of concern, again at the 9 o'clock position about 2 thirds from the nipple which they say only a stereotactic mamm with the accompanying biopsy will confirm. Told them straight that it took 3 years for me to have another mamm on the right boob and all the accompanying ionised radiation - not about to step into having one of these procedures. Whereas the original tumour is towards the outer edge of my boob the new \u2018area\u2019 runs directly (along a duct) across the middle. The mamm I saw back on 25 August I tell you did not look like the one I saw on the screen although it did have one \u2018trait\u2019 which I could recognise which was an area showing, I can only call it, a rounded \u2018tick\u2019 mark of micro/macrocalcifications. Will endeavour to order a copy of all the scans when I go for the consult. I have not had, consistently, the same person dealing with my case. I know they have MDT meetings to discuss my case and the best way forward but only within the confines the treatments they THINK they can use. No-one WANTS to think outside the box about other treatments that could be used that are ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM ie HiFU, Laser, etc. I wonder if asking to be there when they discuss my case would help me to understand their thinking!!!! Consultant Radiologist also said that he thinks that a mastectomy would now be on the table. I have 3 small areas of concern \u2013 why can\u2019t they just take them out? - that's if I went for surgery.  Why take out all the boob of which the majority is okay?  Read (red) the story about how radical mastectomies came about which DID NOT solve the problem of metastatic cancer after the initial treatment and which is why they are now back to lumpectomies. Metasteses, I learn, have already started at the same time of the original cancer though my scans do not show any in me - remember scans can only show tumours when they have reached at least 1cm in size which is 1 billion cancer cells).  It's the metasteses that eventually kill us not the primary! Having learned that why are they still so entrenched? This is a whole body disease because of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and should be treated as such. Localising treatment of the cancer simply seeds problems for the future. Did you know that 99.9% of a cancer cell looks like a normal cell to our immune system which is why most go undetected! Just learned that. Also read that primary cancers send out inhibitors to stop the growth of metastatic disease so if you \u2018cut out\u2019 the primary the metasteses get to grow. Flaming hell!!!??!! If you think about it, a lot of those that have gone down the conventional route do come back on this site with metasteses.  The medical establishment ALREADY KNOW that you may have metasteses already in your body, just waiting, but do they tell us this?  No.  I also have in my head that some people may be lucky in the treatment choice they have been given and who are now becoming 'long term survivors' of this horrible disease.  Remember the statistics only cover 5 years disease free not further down the road.  If you were diagnosed with metasteses the day after the 5 years you would still be a success statistic!  There is a movement in America where women are challenging the establishment on this. Do you also know that Genomic Testing will fully identify your cancer and appropriate treatments can then be used? This innovation will stop the medics from experimenting on you with treatments that won\u2019t touch or regress your cancer! Have I been offered one? NO. Cost at about £700 (according to item on the web \u2013 link attached). http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40479533 This thereby stops any unnecessary expense by the medical teams of trying different/new drugs which won\u2019t have any effect at all! BUT you will feel the effects of it! We need to, as I read somewhere, \u201cdisrupt outmoded models of cancer medicine\u201d. NICE responsible here. Such a bunch of blatantly unlightened individuals and I will say it, pandering to the pharmaceutical companies. However, if the genomic testing actually identified a chemo therapy that would TARGET the cancer in me (provided it has not evolved cos as you know a tumour can be made up of various \u2018types\u2019 of cancer) then I would most probably go for it. It would be a systemic approach but I would NOT have any surgery or radiotherapy. There, you have it, me potentially going for chemo\u2026\u2026 Okay, I have had my BIG BIG whinge. Further research to do. Will come back after the consult.",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies Well I went for my 6 month consultation on the 21 July.  News not so good according to them.  They say the tumour has \u2018grown\u2019 to 6x8mm.  Different ultrasound person \u2013 seems I get a different person almost every time now \u2013 and I know how approximate these measurements are!  As I was getting off the US table I asked if the lymph nodes had been checked.   Nope.  So down I go again and they find a lymph node at about .31mm.  They are not worried about lymph nodes under .25mm so she asked if she could do a biopsy under local anaesthetic.  Yes, I said.  So had a fine needle aspiration not the punch core biopsy I had 4 years ago. Upshot is that I now have a very large bruise on the side of my right boob!  Don\u2019t think I have ever had one this big in my life!  Yeooowww!  And it ached like \u2018billio\u2019 the next day.  Okay now but a mixture of purple and yellow!!!! Anyway, have to go back on 28th for the results of the biopsy.  She did say that it could be okay but the biopsy will show us.  Saw new consultant as original is off on long sick leave but getting better \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask what the problem was but he is not expected back until 2017. Also asked to see the titanium clip on the US which was a tiny white mark.  Told the radiographer that I thought I might have been \u2018feeling\u2019 this when I \u2018cop a feel\u2019 of my boob to try and find my pea sized tumour.  Thought I did find it but when we checked under US it turned out to be a cyst?  I can find/feel a cyst but I can\u2019t find the tumour! Will get back to you all when I have news on 28th. Cyber hugs to all \u2026 still fighting this nasty little critter\u2026.",

But no metasteses.  What a result!  Would have been better to have had no polyps or kidney stone but I am not suffering from any effects by them. It's so weird isn't it.  Didn't have any evidence that I had breast cancer, not suffering from the kidney stone or polyps but all of these things are growing silently inside us and have only been found through the scans. By the way only hot flushes, so far, with the Letrozole.

Neither did she mention putting ice on before and after the injection. Such good ideas and yet we are not told and are being given conflicting information by different hospitals it seems. Puzzler \u2013 thanks for the information. Obviously my research never picked up on the capsule around the liver nor on the potential shoulder pain. See, you do need to communicate with patients who have gone through these procedures to fully know the probable side effects from them. I doubt very much if these are listed in the literature you get beforehand \u2013 if you get any! Many thanks for your responses. Love and virtual hugs",

      "Content": "Hiya Everyone Had a mental meltdown yesterday. Had gone to bed the night before with one of the worst tension headaches in my life. Convinced this was from the chemo. More bl??dy side effects from this chemo. However, I read my notes from the day before and I found that I had had too much SALT. What a stupid cow I am. Along with that I also was starting to get backache but this too could have been a result of having the salt. I am alright now. Just never know what chemo will bring \u2013 having already suffered a micturition syncope-like event and of course the blood clot on the lung!!!! Back to normal \u2013 whatever that is. Overthinking \u2013 YUP, like a bad \u2018un. Went and had the liver ultrasound on Friday \u2013 not the biopsy as originally planned. They said too risky to have a biopsy as it\u2019s a deep-seated \u2018lesion\u2019 and there was a risk of heavy bleeding \u2013 and as it turns out on the ultrasound my lung \u2018dropping down\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what they said \u2013 there was also a risk of a pneumothorax! So just how are we going to treat it, eh! I also questioned the need for the biopsy with the consultant radiologist as I already have ER/PR and Triple negative in my body. It\u2019s got to be one of these \u2013 if it is. The letter to my GP says \u2018confirmed liver metastasis\u2019 without a definitive answer from a biopsy. So frightening the assumptions being made by the medical establishment. YET when I want answers from their expertise/experience they can\u2019t always answer them \u2013 or won\u2019t! 14 November 2018 - consult on potentially having radiotherapy on boob lumps on or near to surface of skin. 19 November 2018 - dedicated Breast MRI to see how chemo is doing 21 November \u2013 consult \u2013 this will determine whether to continue with EC OR go on Paclitaxol OR potentially something else from the latest scans! 23 November 2018 \u2013 the next date for chemo, whichever they decide OR NOT! Still taking the daily innohep injections and have a lovely bruised abdomen but getting better at them. Trick is to make sure you inject SLOWLY giving each injection at least 15-20 seconds to get it in. 5xdaily Filgrastim now taken after the last chemo cycle. 2 injections a day during this time - flipping heck! Love and virtual hugs, see those attending on Saturday who will get real ones. Wahaaay.",

      "Content": "Hi All Happy New Year to everyone. Update: Well I have finished my radiotherapy. 5 x weekly sessions finished 31 Dec 2018. Didn\u2019t go off without a hitch. Found that the bolus caused too much pressure on the rib below the breast on 2 occasions so had to have a break between the re-positionings of the bolus. The last one I was determined to get through it in one go as the previous session saw me waiting about 1 hour to get back in for the other zap! Got an infection of streptococcus dysgalactiae in one of the lesions so was on anti-biotic penicillin for a week. Last session we did another swab and I should receive the results of that on 11 Jan when I go back to the tissue viability nurse in Radiology. Had a total of 30 Gy. Pain continues in the breast but is being controlled somewhat by oral morphine medication now \u2013 4 x 1ml every 4 hours. Can take more if needed. Being referred for pain management to a hospice who manage these things so well. Awaiting BC Nurse to do the research and get back to me. Still having to change daily Allevyn plasters over the breast as sometimes when taking them off it tended to bleed and they don\u2019t want this to keep happening. So using a collogen plaster layer underneath the main plaster. This tends not to make the lesion bleed but has done on one occasion. When you look at the lesions they look like you have an infection of pus but don\u2019t \u2018leak\u2019 like pus. Viability nurse thought mine could be a combination of the infection and the tumours themselves as these ones, from the dedicated Breast MRI scan, were very close to the surface and had very probably broken through. Oncology appointment was on 2 Jan 2019. Going to start the Paclitaxel on 10 Jan. This time 2 courses, 3 weekly infusions with 1 week of rest in between. Had to sign another waiver. After the 2 courses they want to do a CT scan to see how it is doing. They don\u2019t know why the EC didn\u2019t work as effectively as they had hoped. I\u2019m just another guinea-pig! During that time hoping to see some, or all, eradication of the cancer. Had a CT scan on 30 Dec. This showed that because of the break from chemo the main lesion on the liver had grown a couple of millemetres. There was also the other they found previously but I also have another lesion on the liver with the potential of another one which, so far, is tiny so 2 new ones on the liver. Talked with the lady from my hair loss group who said that the Paclitaxel had sorted out her surface lesions so I am very hopeful of this treatment for ALL of cancers. The EC chemo, they think, kept these lesions in check. We can now say that I have secondaries. Hadn\u2019t prepared questions for Oncologist so unsure if I have any more secondaries in the thorax abdomen and pelvis. May need another bone scan to check my bones but I can\u2019t feel any aches or pain arising in any of them except on the rib below the right breast. Oncologist aware of this. I also forgot to ask about the blood clot on the lung and wonder how this is doing. Still taking the innohep for this. Dark hair is growing back from the break of chemo. Feels a bit like bum-fluff at the moment but unsure if the Paclitaxel will take it away again! They SAID some hair loss but we shall see. Still have some of my existing longer hairs on the head \u2013 tough little beggars. Kept eyebrows and eyelashes. General health has been relatively good. Did have an incident of pure liquid diarrhoea which was yellow/orange in colour. Was only the one occasion and everything has been fine after that. This, from google, was bile which is not good but as it was on the one occasion only it could have been down to something I ate. Seem to be constantly pre-occupied with \u2018the bowels\u2019 from the constipation I suffered with the EC! So, I am still going. I do feel that there is an ethos of being \u2018managed\u2019 and not actively trying to secure a good outcome. Maybe the Oncotype DX test could have secured that in terms of choice of chemo but as you know it is not done as a standard. As I was going along with the EC I didn\u2019t have consistency of oncologists and it was only when I had the same oncologist after the 3rd session of EC that note was taken of the burgeoning lesions on the surface of my boob and what I had been telling them. I had said that I thought that the EC should have been given more regularly as I had felt that the bulge of the lesions took more of a hold 1 week after the EC chemo infusion. They just didn\u2019t listen! In fact they hadn\u2019t even allocated me to the one oncologist I prefer to see at my consult on 2 January. You really do have to stay on the ball to ensure you get consistency. AND I didn\u2019t see any consultant throughout my radiotherapy! So enough of the whinge. Will try to come back on my thread after the 1st Paclitaxel and what tell you what \u2018delights\u2019 that brings to me! My love and hugs to you all.",

HOWEVER, this is my post chronicling my journey and the problems I encounter along with my thoughts, updates etc. It is not intended to \u2018diss\u2019 other people of their treatment choices nor to frighten the vulnerable, and don\u2019t forget that I am just as vulnerable. I do actually credit people with intelligence to either absorb the info I give or to leave it - just as I have, along the way, ignored things which I believe would do me harm, ie just one of them - black salve. I do believe that we are now at a point in research where researchers and scientists are exploding into the cancer research area to provide better and more targeted treatments which will be much kinder nullifying, if not replacing, the existing regime. Certainly a growing band of surgeons are now recognising that at some point in the future only surgery will be done where it is needed \u2013 not as a first line or part of treatment. Advances won\u2019t be made for better treatments of BC unless we question what is being done to us now. A one-size fits all approach does not fit all. I was particularly heartened by the new treatment of TNBC. One step forward. I would like to thank all my champions on my discussion. You get the point.

      "Content": "Hi All Thanks for the feedback. jowoomot - have only, as yet, used the endocrine therapy to reduce and stop spread - which as we know was not working due to being on Letrozole for a year.  The Exemestane with Everolimus and the Lemon Mucilage is however working for me as I can feel the 'new area of concern' getting smaller after, now, only 8 days.  Such a big grin on my face when I felt it yesterday.  My preferred treatment is Sono-Photodynamic.  A photodynamic trial is running at the Royal Free Hospital but at the moment is suspended as Prof Keshtgar is ill and unfortunately all his registrars etc on this trial have moved from the department.  It is unknown when this may restart.  However they were trying to get NICE to approve lumpectomies rather than mastectomies which would also help with trial patient recruitment but has succeeded into Phase 2 of this trial. What this entails I haven\u2019t been able to find out as all the locums I have seen have not been given details. The link below will take you to the Daily Mail article on the trial.  It was published I think in November 2013. Unfortunately I would not agree to the mastectomy and didn\u2019t want to mess up the trial by scarpering before the mastectomy and the Prof said I didn\u2019t qualify anyway! http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2439464/Photodynamic-laser-treatment-kill-breast-cancer-15-minutes.html   As to other treatments, Rigvir, GC-MaF \u2013 Rerum is its\u2019 successor, CryoAblation (cold) and ThermAblation (heat), among others. ALL being used outside of the UK. HiFU I watched from a video by UK doctors/researchers on YouTube at a medical conference. This can give a 2 CELL margin with no surgery - not the 1cm margin as dictated by invasive surgery. Argymargy \u2013 many thanks for clarifying the price/s. A question I will ask on the 18th is how long will I be on exem. and ever. I have seen discussions elsewhere showing up to 18 months or more. Carolyn28 \u2013 what a good idea about getting a research grant for treatment! I can but try. Optimistic \u2013 last check on cost of Anastrozole was about £3.75 for a pack although some manufacturers are more expensive. I think some pharmacists through their suppliers are trying to source cheaper tablets so that they can get better margins between the cost the NHS pays to them for the supply.

      "Content": "Hi Newdawn As with any new treatment it has to go through trials even if they have been approved overseas.  At least we can say that NICE are being thorough on this score but it just takes too long to get them to understand the potential benefits for all cancers.  Trialling them for use on these other cancers needs to be done and as usual there is a cost factor.  If you have the money then you can seek these abroad. It isn't necessarily being linked to a big hospital that these potentially new treatments have arisen but through the internet.  Researching your own cancer can give you more information than the short amount of time your consultant, in the UK, can give to a patient.  I know just how fraught my long waits at appointments have been.  Initially they wanted to do surgery (lumpectomy) followed by radiation to which I said No.  Was put on endocrine therapy (Anastrozole).  They felt last year that this had stopped working so put me on Letrozole for a year which didn't do anything.  Hence the Exemestane and Everolimus (with Lemon Mucilage).  I will be asking my oncologist on Wednesday about the Lemon Mucilage.  Interesting addition this Lemon Mucilage.  It is simply high dose lemon with fibre being used as an anti-inflammatory but will ask questions of the oncologist on this and how it became to be included in this treatment. Mastectomy only offered as a direct result of the extra 2 lymph node 'tumours' in the armpit as well as the 'area of concern' (since I haven't had, and I won't have, the stereotactic mammogramme biopsy). They did actually put forward a mastectomy when they said they had 'found' something at the 10-11 o'clock in the same boob way back.  But again I said No.  (It was only microcalcifications though they believe these to be a precursor to a tumour - nothing happened here yet.)  Biopsy, very likely would be done with a fine needle aspiration which I will never have that again - so much bruising and I think resulted in the second armpit 'tumour' through 'seeding'.  Any invasive surgery whether minor or major comes with risks!  In all instances it is hoped that your immune system gets you through.  It is also said that at some point in the future surgery will only be used as a last resort, not initially.  Surgery has its' place but in my opinion not for breast cancer.  The argument for surgery is that it lessens the cancer burden so that the immune system can begin to deal with circulating cancer cells and mop up any residual cancer cells at the excised site/s.  Medical treatment here is chemo and radiation but ultimately it is your own immune system. Don't doubt your own choices, ever.  Work to ensure they were the right choice by keeping yourself well.  Being absolutely selfish here is the key.  Look to your lifestyle and make changes for the better, get rid of anything that is giving you stress. Thanks for your good luck with the planned treatment.  Appointment on Wednesday 18th will be interesting.  Wonder what they will be looking for in the blood test but I will find out. Love and hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi patrb  Anastrozole didn't give me any rashes at all. What rashes I did get were sweat rashes but there could have been a link with the hot flushes I got when I was on it. As to my 'hives' this is linked to the Everolimus.  Hadn't done my research properly and now know it to be a mTOR inhibitor targeted therapy, an antineoplastic chemotherapy drug.  (Wasn't told this beforehand.)  AND one of the side effects is skin problems.  Found this out as when I went for my ultrasound I popped in to Oncology to see if I could see an oncologist to get the hives sorted.  They had become unbearable, extremely hot, itchy and very red.  No-one could help in the department and the breast team suggested going to casualty and get them to call for an oncologist.  It took a couple of hours to sort.  Once again I was treated like a child which is now beginning to bug me.  They want me to continue with the drugs and at the time I only wanted to stop taking ANY drugs.  Given some Eumovate cream (clobetasone butyrate 0.05%) which goes onto the hives and, now, small bumps which are constantly coming up, Hc45 cream (Hydrocortisone acetate 1% w/w) for face (where some hives had started) and Loratadine 10mg tablets antihistamine. Yesterday I was all for stopping the Everolimus but today I seem to be coming around the mountain on the skin front - thank God - although I do still, sometimes, have to take my 'cardie' off when I feel any irritation.  Tablet is once a day with the cream to be put on sparingly twice a day.  Some searching questions to ask on Wednesday as I wasn't told it was chemo related! Have also found a 'trial' in Phase 3 in the UK on this which is still open - UNIRAD.  In America it was called BOLERO-2, France - TAMRAD.  Will ask if I am part of this Phase 3 trial as not told.  Just reading up on 'papers' by American doctors on what they have found out on prescribing this combination with their patients in November 2012.  UK way behind AGAIN. Ultrasound went well.  Now know where the primary tumour located and the suspect area - took photos of the crosses radiographer put on my boob using my phone for future reference.  Can still only feel the 'suspect area but reducing.  Radiographer would not commit to telling me where the lumps are in armpit as she seems to think I now have 4!!!!!!!  Think I should have insisted on an answer and had them marked up as well.  Confusion on the cyst in the crease of the armpit - it is a cyst - at least THAT has now been confirmed. So back Wednesday 1st Nov for 2-week check on the new regime plus a blood test.  Unsure how I feel about chemo!@!  Thursday at another hospital for stroke in the eye check.  My body's definitely falling apart......

      "Content": "Hello everyone Hopefully, just a short note.  I have had to stop both the Everolimus and Exemestane.  My hands just could not take it any more.  They were peeling and had hard skin which broke out into sores.  No matter what I did they just weren't resolving.  The only constant was Exemestane so stopped them both and told onco nurse that I would be stopping these for two weeks until all healed. She was supposed to get back after speaking to the oncologist but didn't.  I stopped taking them from Monday 10th November.  In some areas I use the Eumovate when I get an itch, other parts of the hands I use O'Keefe's Working Hands which does seem to keep them moisturised.  The 'sores' in my palms just need to heal over now.  Still have a lot of rough areas where peeling still trying to resolve.  Due to start taking these tabs again on Wednesday 24 Nov. I think Have also had to deal with an ear infection.  The pain was quite bad.  Got 2 lots of antibiotics from GP both for the ear and a chest cough from a cold which just would not clear and what followed taking them were bouts of the trots.  What more can happen to me!!!!!  One antibiotic was for 5 days and I took the last one yesterday (Sunday).  I still have to take the other for another 2 days.  The ear pain has gone and up to yesterday (Sunday) I still had some loss of hearing but I can hear fine now.  Unsure if these problems are related to Exemestane or Everolimus - there is nothing in the side effects list for these. Winterwolfsoul - these drugs are not chemo but you have made me think that they could be 'akin' to chemotherapy although called an mTOR kinase inhibitor. annieYour username - missed registering and the webinar link you kindly gave.  Did you watch/participate?

      "Content": "Hi Everyone A very Happy New Year to you all. So, I have had my CT scan on the 2 January and the appointment with the Oncologist on 3 January (yesterday). CT scan for thoracic, abdomen and pelvis CLEAR for anything wrong with my lungs with regards to the cough I have or anywhere else except for the known tumours and the suspect lymph nodes. Oncologist did comment on them having increased - as from the last CT scan in July 2016 - but we already knew this.  Anyway, really happy that nothing wrong with lungs or growing anywhere else. So GOOD NEWS. Asked if we were increasing the Everolimus dosage today? Together we decided to wait on the Ultrasound on the 9 January to see if the new medications are doing their job \u2013 at this dosage or not \u2013 then we will decide together if an increase is needed or whether I am just \u2018stable\u2019. Once again, one oncologist did not turn up on the day so we had a bit of a wait. I think I waited at least an hour but since I fell asleep whilst waiting (in the care of my sister who accompanied me again) it didn\u2019t really affect me!!!!!! Having given blood on arrival at about 10am, which was a bit of a palaver as I wasn\u2019t booked in for a blood test, both my sister and I went to have a vegetarian breakfast and I am afraid with a good meal inside me I just needed to have a nap whilst we waited! Still getting some minimal skin issues on my hands, arms and legs but the Eumovate dealing with them. However, on Sunday the nipple on my LEFT breast had gone red. Worrying. Used the Eumovate and most of the redness has resolved although the nipple was still swollen and a bit \u2018perkier\u2019 than normal. Showed it to Oncologist and she is not concerned but we will still keep an eye on it for any change and will make an urgent appointment if any change happens here. A good day today \u2013 HELL YES. So keep on fighting ladies \u2013 as I am. Love as ever",

From what I can gather good levels of sodium sulfate (USA) or sulphate (UK) (so it\u2019s basically a salt, I think) are in the following foods: spinach, silverbeet, swiss chard, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, celery, pumpkin, onion, apples and strawberries \u2013 the ones italicised are the ones I eat. These are what I need to cut down on. The sodium sulfate/sulphate also comes up as a drying agent in detergent and paper pulping!!!!!! Clearly there is a demarcation between being in natural foods and the manufactured stuff but under the same name! I probably need a chemist to make some sense here. With regard to the K2 I will have to buy it. Clearly not enough K2 is in the Chlorella or Spirulina I take. Looked at the breadmaking. Bit of a chore but I will try it without the salt. Richmond, Middx, has a wholefoods store so will try picking up organic from there.",

      "Content": "Hi All Undertook, when passing a chemist, to have a Food Intolerance Screening done with sample from your hair - £59.  Report has just come back. 2 important nutritional items are low - mineral Calcium (despite food and supplementation from Calcichew tablets), and - Vitamin C (despite 3 weeks of liquid supplementation before but still continuing - but then I think it depends on which part of the hair they sampled) Have also been sent a list of foods that are Calcium-rich and will undertake to incorporate these into my diet. Also advised to cut down on sodium sulfate foods. For the first page and a bit on the second there are foods I should stop altogether of which there are only 4 out of the list of 12 I am eating.  I may need to put the ones I don't eat onto Google to see if there are any other foods that I eat, in that genus, I need to stop. The next is a list of foods showing 'stressed' in my sensitivity list which I have to cut back on or at the very best to stop altogether. Out of a list of 18 items I am only eating/drinking 6 \u2013 1 is sodium sulfate (as referred to above) and another, food additives (probably in the bread). Will look at my diet again with a view to amending and getting my nutrients balanced and my body stress free from things that it doesn\u2019t like \u2013 more research! The lady said that my test was interesting and she wants me to do another FOC in 6 weeks\u2019 time.  Something free for once. She loved that I didn't eat Mackerel and no dairy, that I was taking a supplement of 8000iu Vit D per day. I owned up to eating some cheese but I will knock this on the head and very likely has the bad sodium and additives added to it!  Blood results from oncologist do show high levels of sodium, 146mmol/L as opposed to the highest level in the range of 145mmol/L, so I am 1 point over the upper limit. However these levels have been almost consistent since I have had blood tests done. Will see what the \u2018tweaking\u2019 achieves for my next blood test. Will let you know results in 6 weeks time.

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn28 and Winterwolfsoul [edited by admin] Also taking the Liposomal Vit. C.  Practitioner recommended Acerola Cherry Powder so I got Viridian from Revital which I am using on alternate days alongside the Allergy Research Group Micro Liposomal Vit C, liquid, 5ml.  Just realised that I haven't been taking enough of the Acerola on those alternate days.  Only been taking 1/4 teaspoon which equals 180mg so will up this to match the liquid intake.  Did notice the chemical element of this as Sodium Ascorbate but since I was taking this before the blood test of 3 January (for oncology) which only heightened this level by 1 point I am not too concerned - I think. Put into the mix the stopping of the Magnesium and I may see a fall in Sodium intake. Also bought some Lipolife Vit C online \u2013 keeping that in stock until the Allergy one runs out. Servings Allergy Research Group Liposomal Vit C, 5ml = 1000mg (1250%) Viridian Acerola Cherry Powder, 1/4 teaspoon = 1 gram (180mg) (to up this to 7 x quarter teaspoons = 1080mg) Lipolife, 5ml = 1000mg (1250%) \u2013 get a measuring cup with this one! Practitioner also suggested foregoing my bought Orange Juice although it does state 100% OJ.  Instead squeeze 1 (one) orange a day.  So finishing off the bought OJ and already bought 4 oranges!  Love my OJ in the morning.

      "Content": "Hi Ladies and Gents What a week I have had!!!! So where do I start. It\u2019s a long post so get ready! Food Intolerance \u2013 started to have cramp in my legs during the night which wake me up! Decided to go back on the Magnesium so started today. Try to find another source to my high Sodium levels to cut. Oncologist appointment \u2013 saw her (one of three I have seen so far of which this one I am not especially enamoured of) and advises bloods are okay. Unfortunately for me I have had a \u2018bug\u2019 that has been going around and the Tuesday before the Wednesday appointment had spent most of my time asleep!!!!!! Must have spent 20 hours asleep that day and I did have a temperature. Feel tons better today. I hadn\u2019t printed off my summary of past blood tests to ask questions about some high and borderline levels and just could not think right. So I had to pass that over for the next time. She advised that my lymph nodes had grown and they wanted to do surgery. No I said and put forward a list of other treatments being used in the NHS that I would consider giving my preference to which ones I would like to be considered first. Ooops, wrong thing to do. She was clearly affronted by this but said she would take it to the team. Anyway I advised that I also had a swollen armpit and it was causing pain. Obviously inflammation, at least in my opinion, and could have been caused by this \u2018bug\u2019. She did look at it. So we agreed to stop the Everolimus for a week but I may stop this for longer. I am also suffering from numbness mainly in my arms and legs and looking at the side effects of both Exemestane and Everolimus it is the Exemestane which has this side effect. I have decided to stop this temporarily as well to see if that resolves too.   Skin issues still ongoing but will be resolved by stopping the drugs. What the oncologist failed to advise me during our session was that the ultrasound on 9 Jan advised that the original tumour was now 7x3mm nor that one of the supposed \u2018affected\u2019 4 lymph nodes had just \u2018disappeared\u2019 from the radiologists report? This had been a very comprehensive US that had gone over the whole of my breast and axilla at every o\u2019clock position to create 40 images. Once again sleeping most of day before I had failed to bring that summary as well. I did remember that the CT scan reported that I had an \u2018umbilical hernia\u2019 but I hadn\u2019t been told about this. She advised that it was so small that it was nothing to worry about. I replied that I thought it was something that they should have advised me about as it is my body and at the very least I would be aware of it. If I didn\u2019t get copies of the scans with the reports I would never, ever have known about it!!! Is this something, you say, I should worry about in the context of already having BC? I think it is a part of the \u2018whole\u2019 so of course it is important. This CT report also said \u2018no internal mammary adenopathy seen\u2019!!!!!! In defence of this statement, when I lie down on my back my boobs disappear, as most likely yours do, so it was probably not able to be seen by the CT!  But I feel it should have \u2018found\u2019 something. The US report also identified the other \u2018area of concern\u2019 which had \u2018increased\u2019 from 7x12x7mm to 7x14mm. Oncologist never mentioned this AT ALL. Good lord! And you wonder why I am forever asking questions! This \u2018lump\u2019 I can feel and in my estimation it has reduced significantly. From my early beginnings of taking these drugs and having to stop because of the hives and the severe distress they caused me this is the longest period I have taken these drugs consecutively even at the reduced level to allow them to do their work and living with the consequences of their action on my body. I so want this to work. My sister who had accompanied me, bless her, thought that stopping the Everolimus meant \u2018curtains\u2019 for me until the oncologist came back saying no. It\u2019s only temporary and there is another drug that could be used but that she didn\u2019t \u2018think\u2019 that it would be beneficial, requiring an injection every so often \u2013 Fulvestrant. Little snippets you just keep picking up\u2026\u2026.. So the \u2018bug\u2019 is clearing out of my system. The armpit is resolving. I\u2019ve stopped the drugs for the moment and hope to start to feel normal again shortly. My one known breast tumour has shrunk. The other, I think, is reducing. I\u2019ve \u2018lost\u2019 a potentially infected lymph node. I have no mets anywhere else (but who really knows). Am awaiting feedback on potentially a different treatment for BC. Watched a documentary on The Truth about Vaccines (based on USA medical establishmentaria). One lady was questioning the doctor about them and he simply turned around and said that if she didn\u2019t agree to the vaccines for her child then she was \u2018fired\u2019 from the doctor\u2019s practice!!!!! When she saw another doctor for her child he simply said 'be thankful'.  Could this be my cue for walking! Let\u2019s wait and see. As always my love and virtual hugs to everyone on this journey.",

      "Content": "Hi all you wonderful ladies (and gents) Haven\u2019t written on my thread for the longest time but have been encouraged to do so. This will be in 2 separate posts. At the last count you will recall that I was having a \u2018bit of difficulty\u2019 with my NHS team.  It wasn\u2019t augering well.  I made a decision to try to \u2018work\u2019 with them but still keeping a step back from undertaking any surgery procedure they still wanted to do.  Since then I am currently on a break from the Everolimus only (due to side effects) but still on the Exemestane which, by the way, both have some of the same side effects.  I could just as easily be suffering those side effects from the Exemestane!!!!!!!  Anybody else see the problem here!  The side effects HAVE lessened but with both giving some of the same they are not totally eradicated.  However, I am carrying on with the Exemestane as I have consistently been on one endocrine therapy or another since my diagnosis in 2012. My next oncology meeting is on the 4 July.  In the meantime, I have had a DEXX Scan 19 June.  An Ultrasound is earmarked for 27 June, a Mammogramme, for 28 June and an MRI of which I am awaiting the appointment letter.  At the latest consultation, the oncologist wanted to exchange the Ultrasound for the MRI around the same time-frame to which I agreed but Ohhhhh the Gadolinium they want to use.  So in their cause I have agreed as its basically a re-staging that\u2019s being done.  You will learn why in the following posting.  However their system still says that the ultrasound is still booked.  I found this out when trying to get a date for the MRI!!!!!  In the meantime had a call back from my oncology nurse who is going to sort out the appointments as I haven\u2019t had much success with the appointment people.  She said she would ring me Thursday but has failed to do so, so far.  Also received a letter from the radiology appointment people asking my status, ie date of last period, pre-menopausal, menopausal or postmenopausal???????  Sheesh, all this is on my records.  Waited on the appointment phone line for 15 minutes yesterday with no success so gave up on that one.  Will try again today though just to see if anything has been sorted.

They think that the Exemestane and Everolimus not working! Still under the impression I have cancer as they had had the results of the Mamm and MRI back. However they also wanted to do more tests \u2013 CT Thoracic abdomen pelvis (for metasteses), ultrasound biopsies of the tumour and structure of interest (I call it my \u2018area of concern\u2019) and an NM Bone Scan (report of this has come back negative for bone mets). These all now done and just waiting for the reports on the CT and biopsies. Appointment with oncology 1 August for their new diagnosis!! Was supposed to have it 25 July but they didn\u2019t think the results of the biopsies (they took a few) would be back in time and certainly when ringing records Tuesday (24th) these results are not on the system. I also requested the pathology report on a FNA done 2 July 2016 and this is not on her system so the clerk is having to chase these with pathology for me. So the 1 August \u2013 2 days before my birthday \u2013 will be my birthday present!!!!!! Could it be a black or red letter day!!! I am hoping for the latter. Keep fighting people,",

By the way, I\u2019m a Leo and the chart is showing a lot of what I eat already. Therefore I may just be overdoing it with the magnesium supplementation.

      "Content": "Hi All Further to my last post, I mentioned about some numbness in my arms and legs. It was actually in both my hands and feet but a different numbness had also been encroaching along my left side starting first in the arm then leg, up the thigh, into my bum, up to the waist and towards my armpit and is also on the left side of my scalp. I had tried to google but couldn\u2019t find anything. Rang NHS line 111 to be told to get to GP\u2019s immediately. Saw GP who said I had to go to A+E immediately. One of my long-suffering sisters agreed to take me. We went to Kingston Hospital because I am under a consultant there for my central retinal artery occlusion (stroke of the eye). I was taken into hospital as everything pointed to a stroke. The emergency room people said that the CT scan showed this. I had seen the stroke consultant as well on the Wednesday who was adamant that this was not a stroke and passed me over to see a neurologist. They sent me for an MRI and asked me to get my stroke consultant look over the MRI scan. So by chance, it was during my follow up appointment today (Thursday) that my stroke consultant brought up the MRI (or CT) scans (can\u2019t tell which is which from the pictures) where he saw the \u2018infarct\u2019. Seems there is something called a lacunar infarct, in my case in the thalamic area, are also known as a sensory stroke, which gives the signs of a stroke but can only be numbness. He will discuss the MRI with the neuro-radiologist who he advises is shit hot in translating these. I will get a letter of their findings. I will also be getting a follow up appointment. Now to add the next bit\u2026. They used a contrast called gadolinium which \u2018shows\u2019 \u2018an edge\u2019 to the \u2018infarct\u2019. I only saw a white blob, I guess this is what is known as taking a \u2018selective\u2019 view but the inference being that it could be a metastatic BC tumour!!!!!! Therefore the consultant is sending the images to the Royal Free for my oncology and MD team to go over. My next appoint with them is 21 February. I had mentioned some of this numbness to my oncology team but they had put this down to the Everolimus drug which she said to stop for a week. I am now 2 days past the date I should have started\u2026\u2026. I am not sure if I should start again but clearly something else may have caused the numbness rather than the drugs OR maybe it is the drugs!!!!!! I am now home after 3 days in hospital. I have/had no other symptoms of a stroke of the brain which include, weakness of limbs, unable to speak clearly which I certainly can, no droopiness of the face or anything else. One thing, though, is that the MRI I had last year with regard to the eye showed no evidence of anything on the brain so this is a bit worrying. However it seems that there will be a lot of discussion about me over the coming weeks. I should have some answer at least on the 21 February if not by letter from my stroke consultant in the interim. It just keeps giving don\u2019t it\u2026\u2026",

      "Content": "Hi people Many thanks for all your kind words. Now on Day 7 including the day of the first infusion cycle. Taste buds are going. Felt generally unwell when I got up and I do not like that. No hair loss, yet. Guts are moving from laxative, thank heavens. THAT has given me more stress than I would have liked. Never been a \u2018sicky\u2019 person so may hold off on any further emetics they give me in the future until I do have a reaction. Ondansetron was the culprit for being bunged up when I talked to a nurse from the emergency line. Nearly forgot my 2nd Filgrastim last night! No bone aches yet. Chemo brain!!! Noticed that after the chemo infusion on Friday that I kept nodding off whilst I waited for the MRI. Maybe one of my reactions to chemo is that I go to sleep! Certainly I tend to nod off after the evening meal whilst watching TV but been doing that for a long time. Now at 1.30pm I am coming round the mountain. Feeling much better than this morning. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Will do some walking, might just kick start the energy back. Ali owl \u2013 blimey, 12 x weekly paclitaxel infusions. That\u2019s a lot and I thought that my schedule later on for having 4 x 2-weekly was bad. It\u2019s the word \u2018taxol\u2019 that gets to us and we fear its consequences. Hope you are doing okay on this. Love to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi people Been a long time in getting back to you all. I have had issues and disappointment. The SPDT has not worked on the tumour/s, in my case. In fact they have GROWN from the biopsies that were done. THAT I truly believe and has been borne out by other medics I have been seeing. It was just that I wanted to know WHAT was going on in the lumps when I undertook all the re-scanning and biopsies as I wasn\u2019t getting any proper answers anywhere! The \u2018interference\u2019 from the biopsies very likely broke into some form of encapsulation around the tumour/s causing them to grow outwards out of the \u2018bulge\u2019 I told you about. As you know one of the lesions is TNBC which, obviously, is a bit more of a \u2018stinker\u2019. The RGCC Breast Cancer test I had done on 6 September 2018 did come back good however. Back in April the circulating tumour cell count in my body was 4.0. It is now 2.5, a reduction, which is GOOD despite all the interference. The one GOOD thing I can hold onto about this treatment. The private clinic had been receiving all the test results from the NHS I had had done and when I went to see them they stated that I needed to do chemo and surgery. In the mix is possibly radiotherapy but we are a long way from that. The clinic COULD have said try another SPDT therapy, but did not, so not all private clinics are only in it for the money! It was clear to them from the scans that I needed to do something else. When, from 2 corners, it is advocated that you do something then I think you just have to resign yourself to do it. I SO wanted to save my body from the chemo and surgery. As a result I am undergoing chemo \u2013 EC-T (Paclitaxel). Had the first chemo of EC on 21 September 2018. 3 x EC every 3 weeks to come followed by Paclitaxel - 4 cycles every 2 weeks. Tried the cold cap but that is just so awful. Brain was freezing, probably the skin on the head too but it just felt \u2018oppressive\u2019 to me. Not good. Got 3 types of anti-emetic, 1 steroid and the Filgrastim (GCS-F). Anti-emetics have bunged me up!!! Now need a light laxative to get rid of. The \u2018gifts\u2019 just keep coming don\u2019t they. Now I feel, after the first chemo dose, in limbo. Just got no approx. timelines of when I should feel the side effects or what from the chemo! I need to know. Found on some discussion that hair loss could happen in 13 or 17 days. At least I have that to go by. But will I lose my hair? Would I be one of the lucky ones who only has thinning hair? I consider myself an average person so think I will lose it. Have researched the headscarves and wigs already \u2013 just not got them yet \u2013 in case! Felt a bit \u2018wabbit\u2019 this morning but that has gone off. No aches or pain in the joints and muscles, no other side effects that I can feel. So I ask myself is that good! Or is this chemo accumulative so that you then have the known side effects as you go on? Yes, everyone is an individual I know and this can\u2019t really be gauged. Must read all of the Chemo thread/s for more information on patient response on this type of treatment. That is, after all, just what we all want to know \u2013 just what other things we can expect to experience as it is killing the cancer! Curiously, you will note that I am not getting the 5-F, Fluorourcil. Asked about that and said that it wouldn\u2019t really help with me, they said, and has loads of other side effects. It is a drug that was discovered in 1957\u2019ish from mustard gas! At least I escaped that one. Still going on with a positive mood, I hope. Boob at one point sort of \u2018hurt\u2019 when I laid down in bed, before the chemo started, as the lumps \u2018pulled\u2019 on normal breast tissue. This seems to have stopped so maybe there is a reduction in the lumps already! That thinking I am staying with! So that\u2019s it. I am on chemo. It was a hard choice but I made it and will live with it. The rest of the potential treatment will be up for in-depth discussion by me after the chemo. Got to keep them on their toes you know! My love to you all on this journey.",

      "Content": "Update. So now I am on Day 12 (including the day of the first chemo injection/s) of EC. Think, overall, I have escaped so much. Nausea/sickness \u2013 not had any. Maybe the anti-emetics did their job. Digestive tract \u2013 this has been a problem. I got \u2018bunged up\u2019. However on the Wednesday (Day 6/15) I did manage to pass some on my own. Chuddy rock hard! Still I passed it naturally. That night I took Sennakot (never before in my life) and in the morning started getting rid of the \u2018back up\u2019 which was so much easier to pass. Had rung the chemo nurse that Wednesday for advice and she advised a mild laxative. Only took 1 tablet for 2 nights. Said it was Ondansetron they gave me that caused it. Nice! Belching so much though. Understand that this can come from the Filgrastim injections. Last one of these already done. Taste buds \u2013 well these have gone particularly with drinks like my green tea. It tastes like I am drinking liquidised food! Had a Matcha green tea with Mint and it tasted like the MINT SAUCE you put on lamb. Yeuch! Couldn\u2019t finish that one. Coffee seems to be doing okay but still not as I remember. Keep taking the green tea, even now, but not the same. Mouth is really like the back end of a bus! Mouth ulcers \u2013 none of these. Taking extra care here and found I did have a plaque on tongue so used the Corsodyl. All clear now. Bone/muscle \u2013 no aches or pains in these. However, I did have some painful \u2018spasms\u2019 around my lower back. They were worse, coming in waves, when my heart pumped blood around my body! That\u2019s only how I can describe it. This happened Sunday evening (Day 8) and overnight to Monday morning (Day 9). It was so debilitating. I was contemplating getting an ambulance! Took paracetamol, 2 big tablets twice and it didn\u2019t really touch it. On Monday morning tried the Ibuprofen, just 2 tablets, and blow me if it didn\u2019t work! Complete resolution. Also don\u2019t know if going to the loo might have had something to do with it. Could have been \u2018pressing\u2019 on a nerve down there. Hair \u2013 still got this and not losing any on the pillows in the morning but for how long! Already have numbness on the left side of my body from lacunar infarction. Can\u2019t tell if the numbness in the skin on the skull is because of impending hair loss! Scalp does \u2018feel\u2019 different and hair \u2018feels\u2019 dry to touch. On Monday tried to arrange to go to a Hair Loss group at the hospital on Wednesday for free scarf and how to deal with hair loss at the hospital.   No answer yet. Health \u2013 generally very good. Woke up Wednesday and Thursday feeling a bit weak when I went downstairs. Simply watched TV until I \u2018came round the mountain\u2019 as it were. Was determined to get to the Macmillan coffee morning on the Friday and I certainly felt a lot, lot better on that Friday. It does do you good to get out of the house. Temperature \u2013 seems to be either just under or over 36oC. Boob \u2013 well, I do think that the chemo has \u2018softened\u2019 the tumour/s. They\u2019re not as hard. I had been experiencing some grumbles, some to the point of having to adjust my boob as I laid down in bed at night to get comfortable as they were \u2018pulling\u2019 on normal breast tissue. Thankfully I now don\u2019t have to adjust my boob to get to sleep! There are still occasional grumbles which make me \u2018aware\u2019 but not pain. At one point before chemo I had so much inflammation in the boob I could have very cheerfully gone into hospital and said \u2018whip it off\u2019. It hurt that much. Checked the Chemo discussions and got some pointers. Find that I am eating far too much and must put a block on that. I am choosing foods that will give me the taste but they are also loaded with calories. Having done so well on weight loss I am loathe to put it all back on. So, is this it! Is this what I can expect of the rest of the EC cycles! Next cycle due on 12 October. We\u2019ll see how we do then now that I am more \u2018armed\u2019 with the side effects of EC on my body. I\u2019m retired \u2013 ooooh, how old that makes me feel \u2013 and gives me the time to concentrate on myself. I have only absolute admiration for anyone who also has to work during chemo. Give yourselves a great big pat on the back. My love as ever to everyone on this journey, [edited by admin]",

      "Content": "Hi All Had my MRI Liver and CT Thorax Abdomen Pelvis scans. Come back with suspicious lesion on the liver so no distorted image here! Also a smaller one more deep seated. Now want me to have a liver biopsy. Yikes \u2013 reading up on this and not happy about it - it can cause seeding of cancer and this from the UK British Liver Trust! If anyone has had this can they come back to me on how this went for them? Have watched a video on YouTube on how they do in America which has given me a sense of what is to come. Was a bit \u2018alarmed\u2019 that this is a long day procedure and that one of the worst things to happen was that I could have a major bleed from it!! Having said the above you will be aware that I am now taking innohep injections for the blood clot on my lung. No advance preparation mentioned by oncologist on what to do about these like stopping them now or explaining IF this is the right way forward given the risks! They also want to do another Breast MRI to see if there is ANYTHING that the chemo is doing. Awaiting appointments for both of these. Boob was doing well but some new lesions beginning to show \u2013 one particularly near the surface. It has red capillaries pushed to the top of the skin and are noticeable. If it gets any bigger it will break through the skin to become a fungating cancer lesion! I am a little alarmed that the medics not paying as much attention to this as with the liver. Did ask about any treatment for this in the interim and the only thing they said was to have some radiotherapy on it. Immediately refused - though I am still thinking about it. Mentioned a few other alternatives in their field like HiFU, Radiofrequency Ablation, Laser but nothing came back from oncologist. KNOW, from research, that Radiofrequency Ablation being used in America on the breast. NHS just so slow on the uptake as with the example of Proton Therapy. Government shamed into getting 2 of these built, 1 in Manchester, now built, and 1 in London, being built, from the time when that young lad was \u2018kidnapped\u2019 from a hospital in the UK by his parents and taken to Europe to have it for his brain tumour. Kid is doing really well as a result. We just don\u2019t get enough options from the NHS or maybe it is just this hospital which doesn\u2019t have the options. Will ring other hospitals to see if they do something. Ok, rant over. Otherwise I am in good health if becoming a bit of a \u2018pin cushion\u2019 with bruises from the innohep injections, the collapse on my bathroom floor, hair loss, dry hands, 1 bout of diarrhoea \u2013 all from this latest cycle of chemo. Lovely! Today, I have had my 3rd chemo cycle anyway. Until the new scan result and biopsy are known it seemed this is the best way forward for the moment. All my love to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi All Hair Loss group This was a blast. Arrived early, about 10.45am. One lady already there. No-one else expected. Two ladies doing the session. Form filled in. Received a list of items we will be looking at. Two further ladies roped into the session from waiting room \u2013 so 4 ladies and 2 hair people. Arranged by Macmillan with a group called HeadWrappers.. A bit cramped in the Macmillan consultation room. On with one of those hairnet things you see actors and actresses put on first below their wigs, for health and safety reasons. When you use your own scarves you wont need this. Cotton is best for staying in place. The first lady had such negativity about colours and the faffing that is required when we started trying to put headscarves on. It didn\u2019t let up either. Still she had a lot to deal with as she has metastatic cancer throughout her body now and with this chemo round she was starting to lose her hair which was causing her a lot of distress. She wasn\u2019t dealing well with the cold cap a few sessions in either. So having tied the basic cotton scarves around our heads with other little scarves acting as \u2018foils\u2019 we moved on. One lady was called out of the session for her appointment who had been roped in and never came back, the other lady kept popping out as she felt sick. Did come back one or two times but eventually didn\u2019t come back at all. Only we two original ladies were left. Good we had one-to-one attention. We then proceeded to ready made scarf hats. These would act as a base and we could add things over the top making them different each time. I found these much, much better to get on and off and less of a faff and so did the other lady. These looked like some of the things I had seen on websites. There were also a few hair pieces. One was a fringe that just peeps under the scarf. Another was a \u2018half\u2019 wig, shoulder length, dark colour. It had straps over the top of the head and it\u2019s combined with a hat. Other lady really liked this as she still had shoulder length grey hair to start with and with a \u2018pre-made\u2019 scarf hat over the top it was very effective. You would not have thought there could have been a bald head under there. Tried this myself and went \u2018Chuddy hell!!!\u2019. TWICE!  I looked 20 years younger!!!!! - and back to the time when I did have shoulder length hair. There were further examples of showing us how to enhance the hats/caps, etc. Two and half hours we were there and left with the free chosen cotton headscarf we had used during the session, an accessory and a bit literature which I have yet to fully read. You order the items that looked good on you from the websites these hats had been supplied from. That was the purpose of the list of items we would see and tried on to note the ones that worked for us. They are quite cheap. Had forgotten my mobile. What a time to forget! The session ladies said that when I order the stuff I liked that suited me I should send them a photo so gotta get on the web pages to order BEFORE I lose my hair (if I do). Still keeping positive on that one but also want to be prepared. Does anyone know if this is a new thing? But I do recommend that if you see these sessions advertised in your hospital, have a go. Love and virtual hugs to everyone on this journey.",

      "Content": "Okay, where to start. Tuesday evening, 13 November, got cramps in left foot which just would not resolve. With that also had an ache in left leg, off-centre of the shin halfway down towards outside edge. Uh oh. Potential DVT? Rang 111. Had to wait for a doctor to come back. Cramps eased off by time he rang but said to get to A+E. Sister took me and 3 hours later I discharged myself. Yes, I know. Wrong you think. But I had had enough of the waiting around. I was very hungry having not had anything to eat. At the time of the cramps I was trying to get my tea! He said in leaving to get some food I would be discharging myself! Nurse who had taken bloods before I saw the doctor hadn\u2019t taken enough so Phlebotomy would not process. Doctor had to take more and did. This would have been another hour of waiting for them to come back after being there already for 3 hours! Then the doctor had the nerve to say that because I would be discharging myself the new bloods taken would be binned! And they probably have been. I tell you, that\u2019s when I really exploded. First cannula was beginning to hurt which was in the back of the hand, the stress, anxiety, etc, just got to me. They took 10 minutes to send a nurse in to take out the cannula. I had calmed down by then and she was nice. She wasn\u2019t any of the people at fault. I had to give my details 5 times \u2013 reception, triage nurse, A+E reception, nurse who took me in to A+E and finally the doctor who saw me. Unbelievable. The cannula was taken out - a lovely bruise now forming. Off home. REMINDER TO LADIES ON CHEMO \u2013 SHOULD you EVER need to go to A+E, make sure you tell Reception YOUR ARE ON CHEMO. You are fast tracked and SHOULD be put into a cubicle with a door. This is to keep you away from ANY germs/bugs that people may bring into A+E. My local hospital also has an Urgent Care Centre all within the same area. I didn\u2019t advise that, and is probably why I was there for so long. It still took around 40 minutes for the doctor to see me though! Now to the Radiology/Oncology appointment on 14 November. Upshot is that I will be having radiotherapy on the boob. This will be whole breast treatment. I will have a CT scan with planning session on 23 November. That same day I am due to have my last EC chemo but this is an unknown factor at the moment whilst the radiology/oncology consultant talks with my oncologist to see if this will be necessary. If I do have the EC I will need the following 3 weeks to get over it before any radiotherapy can be given. Doc says she will need this time to do the computations. Expected start time for radiotherapy 14 December. Radiotherapy will consist of going only once a week! Doctor said it will be 5 sessions in one! Has anyone heard of this scheduling? As I told you I had started to get lesions going red/pink on or near the surface of my boob. I had wanted something done about them! Radiotherapy was the only thing they could offer. Refused at the time. But they have gotten worse and new nodules are appearing in the outer quadrant and below. My research has not turned up anything else. Mainly, refusal to be given answers from well-known hospitals. Disgraceful! Get a referral from GP, no reply to emails, etc, etc, are their stock replies. So, once again, I am having to take a route I did not want. I just hope I get through it alive and in reasonable health!  See those attending on Saturday with big hugs. Love to you all",

      "Content": "Hi All Thanks for the responses kacang and Optimistic.  Have received Allevyn Gentle Border plasters which are the same.  Have been given 2 sizes.  One covers the main area, the other will cover all.  However I find that the smaller one is better provided I put Savlon instead over the nodule just above the crease line.  This one hasn't broken out yet with bleeding or exuding lymph but had been rubbed/pressed upon the boob with the plaster being put on by the nurse in a diamond shape adhering to the body below it.  As with anything that gets irritated it gets inflamed and painful.  It sorted itself out when I applied the Savlon and no dressing.  I just hope it stays that way.  Plasters in themselves don't cause me any irritation. Glad that other people have had the bolus.  I thought I was unusual!  Just never seen it mentioned by anyone on here nor is it in the literature I was given on radiotherapy treatment! Ah well, we continue to learn more as we go along!!!! Love and hugs to everyone",

      "Content": "Hi All Well, I asked the question, didn\u2019t I! Prognosis. They said I had 18 months left to live! Responded with, \u2018Well, I have bucked the trend so far and intend to continue to do so\u2019. I think they thought I was going to break down in tears. Didn\u2019t. Unsure if this prognosis will be as a result of everything they will be doing in the meantime. Positive thinking will get me through all of this. As a result of the lesions forming under the skin and on it, quite a few now, I am being fast tracked for radiotherapy. I have had my CT and planning session and first radiotherapy will be on 4 December \u2013 not sure yet of further dates planned. 5 x weekly sessions giving 6Gy per session. This will \u2018irradiate\u2019 me with a total of 30Gy. Normally it would be a daily dose for 5 days of 2Gy per day over the week (Mon-Fri) for 5 weeks giving a total of 50Gy although when I questioned Radiologist she quoted 40.2Gy as a standard. As I was having pain and the lesions finally being recognised as \u2018growing\u2019 they realised what I had been saying for weeks during the chemo. This is why you really need to have a consistent oncologist on your case, not just another member of the team, to see how the breast is doing physically by one person, not just through the scans. I have ordered the latest so should get them soon so I can have a gander. Was told that radiotherapy would give a \u2018good result\u2019. At last consult with oncologist, got them to quantify the \u2018good result\u2019, percentage-wise. They said 85% but can \u2018range\u2019 up to this %. So long as it reduces the surface lesions I will be happy. These were what were \u2018bothering\u2019 me the most. Last cycle (4th) of EC chemo was cancelled. That would have been on 23 November. If I had had it they would have had to wait another 3 weeks for me to recover from this before radiotherapy thereby delaying it further! They seem to think that chemo is resolving \u2018scarring\u2019! Or that the total area of cancer is \u2018softening\u2019. That\u2019s why they kept me on the chemo so long. BUT clearly it was not addressing the surface lesions. Just don\u2019t know which of the cancers I have that is doing the growing! Liver lesion has not changed on the dedicated Breast MRI done on 19 November compared with the Liver MRI on 24 October, I think. Having said that they may have compared it to the Ultrasound on the liver on 9 November where measurements were taken. They said that they hope that chemo will deal with this which means, I suppose, that I will be going back onto another chemo (or the Paclitaxel which would have followed the EC) after the radiotherapy which may also deal with the rest of the tumour in the breast. Oncologist will think on this. Surgery - this would be difficult due to tissue viability from incisions at the point where the lumps/nodules are forming just under the skin on the crease below the boob. Suppose we will have to wait and see what the radiotherapy does and any further chemo I may have to undertake.  Have been a bit chesty lately which has seen me a bit down these last few days and mollycoddling myself until I read my Stars: \u201cTrust your hunches and aim high, as anything is possible at the present time. If loved ones act as devil\u2019s advocate, listen but don\u2019t be put off. Believe in yourself and you\u2019ll go far\u201d. So today is Day 1 to pick myself up, dust myself down and start believing in myself again. I can do a lot more to enhance my lifestyle. Diet has not been good and can be easily rectified. Must do more exercise. Could go and get ozone therapy and/or even Vit C IV injections \u2013 this latest one not had yet \u2013 may do some good. I WILL bounce back and defy the odds. Watch me. Love and virtual hugs to everyone on this journey",

      "Content": "Hi All Update \u2013 You could say I am okay but then I am suffering from radiation burns/peeling. As you are aware I had lesions at the surface of my breast and contracted a strep infection \u2013 had to have another week of the penicillin. I was told not to put any creams on the breast. Wish I hadn\u2019t listened. But then what do I know. Well, with regard to radiation burns, absolutely nothing. Last radiation was done on 31 December 2018 and there was a pinkness there. This has now gone to bright red and peeling of the skin with associated, sometimes, pain, always discomfort, and of course the requisite incredible itching. Was using the R1 gel and R2 cream but this was not enough. I had what you might call chapped skin which \u2018broke\u2019 when I moved myself or even my arm. The \u2018chapped\u2019 areas were on the chest and just under the armpit in that general area. On Friday I started lashing on the E45 cream and, oh boy, did that start to work. Over the weekend I have \u2018peeled\u2019 off so much skin \u2013 only that which lends itself to being lifted although there have been 2 times when I wasn\u2019t taking enough care and peeled skin off which wasn\u2019t quite ready \u2013 OUCH! I get itching after putting on the cream but this is the loose flaked skin which has \u2018blobbed together\u2019 causing irritation, this is what I remove. Am now lashing on the E45 at least 4 times a day. Tomorrow I have a Community Palliative Care Nurse coming in the afternoon to discuss all of this. They also like to work in conjunction with District Nurses. I had complained about the pain I was receiving from the lesions on the surface of my breast. At this moment in time I don\u2019t seem to have any of these though get a couple of \u2018gripes\u2019 occasionally. I can\u2019t yet distinguish whether these are from the peeling skin or the tumours themselves. They are so similar. Feels like something sharp running across/in the skin and is so acute it stops me in my tracks. Been discharged from tissue viability with Radiology though I think this was far too early \u2013 passing the buck to the lady above. Still we had a good chat when making the appointment to see me so things might be better going down this route. Had 2 of the Paclitaxel treatments so far. 3rd is on Thursday. Have a 1 week rest from the Pac the next week but have Oncologist appointment instead. Have been too pre-occupied with the radiation burns to notice anything from the Pac. Certainly I have no peripheral neuropathy, have some fatigue but then the radiation burns/flaking is really getting me down. Still on the low dose morphine. Both times at Paclitaxel treatment my blood pressure has been way down on normal, potentially stopping the treatment but have still gone ahead with it. Seems it could be the Ramipril (blood pressure tablets) so now have to take BP before taking them. Without them my BP is in the normal range so not taking these pills but need to do a med review with GP. We\u2019ll see how we do after BP taken on Thursday morning!!!!!! Still on the innohep for the blood clot on lung which might just be enough to also control BP. Med review with GP may clarify this. So I am still here. Still go onto the Macmillan site and read the discussions though don\u2019t respond as much as I did. Too pre-occupied with myself!!!!!!! Love and virtual hugs to all on this horrendous journey \u2013 well for me it is!",

They need to give me a prescription. NOW WAIT FOR IT \u2013 I have a blood clot on the lung!!!!!!!! Radiographer from the CT scan saw it. Now have to take innohep injections every day in the tum, indefinitely. Blood clots in lung can progress to pulmonary embolism which can be FATAL. Effing hell!!!! Asked if this was the chemo and is certainly mentioned in the side effects. Medics said it can be as a result of both the chemo and myself. What! Had no indication of this before chemo!!!!! Certainly reading up the signs of a blood clot in the lung don\u2019t mean anything to me as I haven\u2019t had any!!! Sheesh! I really do feel fine. Hair loss \u2013 still continuing and could be classed as bald. Still quite a few tough little \u2018stayers\u2019 though all over and can still make a semblance of hair at fringe, sides and back under my hats. Keep on in there you tough little stayers! Boob - sometimes aches/pains me. Taking the Paracetamol stopping this though only taking intermittently now and only if I feel a pain. No Ibuprofen though as it can mask inflammation/infection. Had some pau d\u2019arco under the breast \u2013 this has now gone \u2013 chemo must be working. Can feel the Lesion 1 (ER3/PR6) but the whole area does seem to be softening and some of the nodules have gone! Lumps near the crease have got smaller! Keep it up girl! Taste \u2013it\u2019s only my green tea now which is still a problem. Food tastes fine. So there you have it. Me on this chemo train and it\u2019s joys! Love, hugs and positive thinking to all.",

      "Content": "Hi All So what can I tell you. Chemo \u2013 had the 3rd dose of 2nd cycle of Paclitaxel 21 February 2019. This week is rest week. What I don\u2019t know is actually how many cycles of Paclitaxel they are intending to give me which is frustrating. A question for my Oncologist 6 March. Fatigue \u2013 overwhelming, haven\u2019t had the spark to do or even entertain doing anything! Think there is a cumulative fatiguing effect of the Pac. No wonder you have to have a \u2018rest\u2019 week. No other health conditions that could account for it. Today, 26th, was the first day I felt I could actually DO something. Boob \u2013 radiation recall now resolving/resolved though I do still have areas around the boob which are darker than the actual boob! I have no open lesions but do have a lump just above the crease at the 5o\u2019clock position where neither the radiotherapy nor the chemo is having any effect! So what is it? The other 2 that could be felt easily, in my estimation, have been partially \u2018eaten\u2019 by the strep infection! Another question to ask the Oncologist.  Boob is softer, 'hangs' better and is looking more like a boob! Weekend away \u2013 had a weekend away from Saturday 16 Feb to 18 Feb to Lake Windermere where we stayed at a hotel to celebrate my brother\u2019s 70th birthday. 5-course dinner on Saturday evening. I didn\u2019t feel stuffed at all. Up for a hearty breakfast Sunday but I didn\u2019t really eat that much and then an hour later the guts began to ache! What a time I had. There was no way I could leave the room, had to be close to the loo and just slept most of the day. Was just able to manage getting home on the Monday but for the rest of the week I was trapped indoors. Just did not want to do anything. I have no idea where this came from. At the moment I am inclined to think that it has something to do with a cumulative effect of the Paclitaxel. So no big dinners for me until the chemo is finished. Sigh! Type 2 Diabetes \u2013 District Nurse came 4 Feb to \u2018change my dressing\u2019 on the lesions. These were clearing up under my administrations so she didn\u2019t have to do anything. I had stopped the plastering of my boob with the silicon and Allevyn plasters and just \u2018plastered\u2019 my boob with the E45 cream to deal with the intense itching and peeling. Just \u2018knew\u2019 somehow that this was the right way to go. The District Nurse did take my blood glucose which was 8.5 \u2013 far too high. However this has to be measured against eating breakfast within the 2 hour window. Another District Nurse came on 23 February where the reading was 6.0 \u2013 in the normal range. I had checked up on this and made the investment into a blood glucose machine to rule out this type of diabetes as a cause for my fatigue. Type 2 diabetes causes fatigue and they say there are no outward signs to tell you you have it. Well there are. Just search the web. Peripheral neuropathy \u2013 think I have a bit at the end of my thumbs and forefingers, both hands. Nothing much to worry me but they do feel a bit \u2018dead\u2019. Lung clot \u2013 still taking the tinzaparin (innohep) for this. Now finding that any blood taking or chemo infusion is leaving massive dark bruises. Hadn\u2019t been doing any bruising until blood test on 14 February which still hasn\u2019t gone! Anyone know why this is happening now? Are my veins breaking down? Do we continue with the tinzaparin? Is this an effect of a resolution of the blood clot in the lung? So many questions. More questions for the Oncologist. Hair is still growing though a little too short (and still cold enough) so I still wear my hats, no mouth ulcers but I do have a metallic taste sometimes in the mouth, Yeuch!, not taking Ramipril (blood pressure tablet) as Pac KNOWN to reduce blood pressure, not taking the oral morphine now \u2013 there are still grumbles in the boob but only light twinges which pass quickly. So, at the moment, I am \u2018becoming\u2019 well again, I hope. I also hope there is nothing more down the line to come! Need answers from Oncologist! Love and virtual hugs to all on this journey.",

      "Content": "Hi Patsy plum I am on neo-adjuvant Anastrozole and have been since 31 October 2012.  My tumour was 13 x 7 x 21mm and is now, or should I say at the last count (1 August 2013)  5 x 5 x 7mm.  My write up under my name gives the full story.  In order to get a more up to date 'sizing' I would have to undergo MRI, ultrasound and mamm which haven't been offered as yet.  If I feel the need for this I am sure my consultant would facilitate this. So, of course it works or you wouldn't be getting it (although in rare cases it sometimes does not work).  It's an alternative way to reducing the tumour before surgery if you elect to have surgery - if you have ER+ and/or PR+ hormone positive cancer - which is a whole load gentler than having chemo.  You may have to put up with a lot of side effects from the Anastrozole but luckily for me I only had the hot flushes and those are lessening. In my research Anastrozole's cancer busting properties is set at about 90% whereas Letrozole is set at 99% and therefore has more side effects felt by the recipient.  Heather77 experienced a lot of these but on Letrozole. What you do need to know is that different brands of Anastrozole give either more or less side effects. I thought that the Accord brand caused more problems for me and stuck to Teva but this brand is sometimes very difficult for my pharmacist to get hold of.  However I can now take Accord without the additional side effect which was joint pain in my wrist and thumb. I wish you well in all your future treatments. ....still fighting this nasty little critter....",

One of the things I do is that until I actually know there is a problem I wait and see.  This keeps me balanced.  There really is no benefit to your present mental or physical health and as you are well aware we are more than stressed out about having or had BC in the first place.

      "Content": "Hi All Noticed this discussion.  I was given some Simple for Christmas but having checked the ingredients on them they contain parabens so had to give them away.  I am now soooooo conscious of what goes on my skin.  I have found Nivea Soft (moisturiser) with Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E free of parabens and toxins for my face.  When I get in the shower I use paraben free hair shower products - some from Tesco and some from a health shop.  I was also given for Christmas 'faith in nature' pomegranate and rooibos shampoo and conditioner which are also free from artificial colours and fragrances, no parabens or SLES. (cant remember what that is - sodium lauryl ether sulphate, it's a chemical.  And the only other thing is the water which has chlorine - which is NOT good and is the only thing I clean my body with.  Use a Dove soap for my hands when needed but also have a bar of Oliva which I believe is also paraben free. UK water is chlorinated - cheaper.  The French who have less cancers have ozonated water but it could also be down to them eating a lot of garlic! - a cancer fighting natural 'herb'. As for deodorant this is interspersed between Dove invisible dry or a Crystal body deodorant stick which has to be dipped in a little water then put underarm - its hypoallergenic and fragrance free.  Got that one as a present so no idea where to buy it.  For my teeth I use, from phyto shield, propolis, botanical oral care toothpaste from a health shop.  In this way I keep personal care environmental toxins out of my body. Having said that, as you are aware, I have not gone down the route of conventional treatment - just the Anastrozole - so I don't have any recovering wounds and the deodorant could pull on the skin. ... still fighting this nasty little critter...",

      "Content": "Hi Birda No, you didn't mishear.  Yes there are 'One Stop Shops' where all tests are done so you know in one day if you have breast cancer.  On the other hand you will also know in one day whether it is benign.  Such a difference from my days back in 2012. Screening Mammogramme found the lump - 8 August 2012 Recalled for another mamm where they did biopsy - 20 August 2012 Told me that they found cancer and wanted to do surgery - 28 August 2012 Referred to a hospital closer to home, consult - 7 Sept 2012 Appointments for further scans - MRI which I crapped out of the first one due to having eaten before and was laying on my tum with boobies dangling - 17 Sept and 21 Sept 2012 CT Scan - 20 Sept 2012 Consult for treatment plan - 26 Sept 2012, with long talk with nurse afterwards on what to expect Stopped surgery and sentinel node scan planned for 11 Oct 2012  - 3 October 2012 Appointment with oncology to do hormone therapy - 31 October 2012 Certainly my case is completely different from the norm and yours might be also.  However in one day you will know what your lump is.  The waiting between appointments has been the 'bad' part for most of us with its uncertainty.  You at least will get an answer on the day - that's good in a roundabout way!.  I should imagine what happens after that is that you will be scheduled for a meeting with the consultant on the treatment plan they have come up with for your type of breast cancer and that only if you have a tumour!  It could just as easily be a cyst. Anyway, how this works is new to us 'oldies'.  So come back on here and let us know how it works unless one of the other writers on this website knows otherwise. Best of luck and sending you virtual hugs",

      "Content": "Hi Comper22 Yeowww, getting the call must have frightened you out of your wits!  From what I can gather you have a cancer tumour in your boob of 6.5cm size with 1 lymph node affected with some other 'spots' in your boob around 1mm in size.  You also have, potentially, cysts on your liver for which you need an MRI to determine positively what they are.  You will be undergoing FEC T chemotherapy first (I assume to reduce the tumour) followed by surgery then radiotherapy assuming liver will turn out to be okay.  All correct so far? Wow, what a lot of information to soak in!  6.5cm tumour is quite large and having chemo first should reduce its size.  Remember to watch out for side effects!  I am sure there are more people on this site who can offer you further help/commisseration.  Please remember we are all here for you and just talking with other likeminded people who have been and are going through it does help.  You are not alone as you know. ... still fighting this nasty little critter....",

      "Content": "Hi Mirabo Because it is so costly (not in our terms) even GPs will not give you the originals.  I don't know how many packs you have tried or how many packs of the same brand you were given (say 3 monthly supply) but you could order only 1 pack of each generic brand to try them out.  Keep your diary of side effects which can only give evidence of your intolerance to the cheaper/generic brands.  Seems no-one in the powers that be want to understand the massive impact these have on individuals.  For Anastrozole I have done a chart of the different stuff that is in each brand.  Some say the same but do not have a number next to the ingredient.  It is possible that there is a cheaper version of that ingredient which is causing the problem.  Certainly I have heard that a hypromellose ingredient caused some ladies a lot of discomfort. If it gets too bad then just go back to GP with your diary. Best of luck",

AND it was written 18 months ago!  Medics just not up to speed on this. When I was on Letrozole I started to log on a spreadsheet all the ingredients of the tablets.  You can get sooooo many variations of just one ingredient, ie. Macrogol - coating, Macrogol 300, 400, 4000, and in Femara says Macrogol 8000!  And they all have TALC - something which has been on the news of late. Just some information to arm yourself with.

However I note that you have been on Anastrozole for 19 months and I suspect that you have had various brands in that time.  Did you notice if any particular brand gave you less side effects?  Alternatively you could ask if you could be put onto Arimidex to see if you get less side effects or none at all!  Anastrozole is the generic form (patent now expired meaning other pharma can now make it) of Arimidex and it's the fillers that cause the side effects. It is always worth an ask.",
