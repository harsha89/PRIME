      "Content": "Hi Thank you for this information. I had WLE (Grade3 & ER+) & SLNB 10 days ago. I have swelling in my armpit that my BCN & surgeon have put down to surgery after effects rather that the start of Lymphedema. I was originally told I would have 3 weeks of radiotherapy after this initial treatment but a different surgeon performed my surgery and beforehand mentioned chemo. After surgery he said 'it looked messy in there' (my armpit) and said that although the original FNA result (taken 2 months ago) came back negative, it was likely I would need to go back for Lymph Node Clearance. I'll be getting my results on Thursday. I'm already suffering the effects of 'cording' which today reached my lower arm despite doing the exercises every day since the day after surgery. I'll be calling my BCN later to see if there's anything else she or I can do. At least when I go on Thursday I'll have a little more idea about what to expect. As I have a son who is still dependant on me, my life takes priority over my arm but I'll be devastated to lose the use of it as I love to craft/sew etc...... Kind regards",

I have had to resort to using Accord instead because this is all they have in stock currently. I'm not a happy bunny!",
