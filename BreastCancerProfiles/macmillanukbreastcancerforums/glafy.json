      "Content": "Got Diflofenac gel so giving that a go. GP insistent that if it not improved in 3 days to go straight to see her in case it's an infection, which is fair enough. She was happy to prescribe the gel though as she's aware thast the BN is the 'expert'. Yep I'm on Tamoxifen 20mg since October. Been having awful hot flushes but, luckily, minimal hot sweats. We have a remote control ceiling fan so I sleep with the control next to the bed & it's on, off, on, off all night. LOL. I've bought one of those little hand held fans too so that goes everywhere with me.! I had read on a forum here that taking the Tamoxifen at night can help & I have to say it has, the flushes haven't been as bad., Now I'm not sure if it is that which has helped or the fact that I have been on them for just over 3 months or even if it's psychological but whichever it is, things have improved!! Sleep is the other problem.....driving me nutty, the only time I get a decent night is when I am so completely shattered from not sleeping...if you get what I mean! Are you on the same dose? presume you are having some lovely side effects too? Of course the alternative doesn't bare thinking about so onward & upward as they say!!! :O) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi all. Has anyone had breast pain in the affected breast a year after surgery?I had a lumpectomy in March last year with clear margins as well as SNB, all clear. Then followed 6 FEC 100, finishing in August, then 19 radio' sessions. I had awful burns/infections after my radio (Big Boobs which I believe dont help!!) All cleared up but since last week my treated breast has become sore all over and feels 'full' as if I was due a period, which I'm not (had hysterectomy!) I'm on Tamoxifen 20mg but this isn't listed as a side effect. I have decided to phone my breast nurse tomorrow as it's now getting uncomfortable at night but was wondering if any of you guys had had any experience of this? Hope everyone is staying strong. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Has asked me to either pop to clinic (ages away) for a 'script' of Diflofenic (spelling?) off consultant or phone GP's & ask them for one. GP's now phoned & am waiting for a call back. Going well so far!! BN recommended some massage of the breast too as prob lymphodaema too. (Shan't mention that to Hubbie!!!!!!) :O)",

I was slightly worried when it started hurting but you lovely ladies have helped to put my mind at rest. Hope you all stay well. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Apart from feeling the cold (I knew it would be, but boy it REALLY is!) it is rather liberating and I feel I have now  taken back control. I have a big family 'do' on Sunday & have decided to go Au Naturel. I will worry more about my wig looking good  than being bald. I hope you are all ok & have a good weekend. xxxxxxx  ",

      "Content": "I have been looking  for cancer 'friendly'  travel insurers as I will be going to the USA at Christmas. Macmillan have a leaflet \"getting travel insurance\" which is very useful. I have also been given a list of insurers who have a spaecial interest (whatever that is!!) in providing ins' to people with medical conditions! These include:- AA Travel Age concern All clear (!!) Aviva City Bond sure  travel Free Spirit solutions Freedom travel Higos Insure Blue Insure Cancer   There are conditions to some of them re life expectancy, pre existing conditions etc. I haven't  called any of them yet as I am going to wait until nearer the time which will, hopefully, reduce the premium!!
