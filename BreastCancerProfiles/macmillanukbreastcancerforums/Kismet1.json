      "Content": "Hi Tracy, I had the same op as you back in September and, like you, felt much better than I was led to believe I would feel. I took a couple of painkillers once or twice in the recovery period. Otherwise, it wasn't a huge thing to deal with. However, there are a couple of points I would raise with you. I don't know if you have one, but I had a drain which was supposed to be in for about 10 to 14 days. Like you, I was up and about and getting things done. About a week or so after the op, the tube of the drain caught on a cupboard handle and was pulled out enough for it to be useless from that point on. They had to take it out before it had finished doing its job. I ended up with a seroma (swelling) in the breast. It didn't take too long to go, but I could have avoided this if I had taken more care. Also, I'm sure you have been told that you do need to be aware of the risk of lymphodeama. This is a big deal. If you push yourself too hard at this stage, you do run the risk of triggering it and once you have it, there's no going back. I'm not always too great at doing as I'm told, particularly if I'm told to take it easy, but I did listen and still am listening with regard to this. Do your exercises religiously, don't push it too hard, feel the stretch but not the pain. Good luck K xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, I have been taking Letrozole for about 6 weeks now. My first month's supply was the Accord brand. I now have two month's supply of Manx. I have more acid reflux with this brand, but if I remember to take it in the evening, rather than in the morning, it isn't so bad. Both brands speed up my heart rate and I have also had problems with my eyes. The eye specialist says it isn't due to the drugs, but it is a coincidence! K     ",

      "Content": "Thank you George. The anaesthetist gave me meds to speed up my heart rate during the operation back in mid-October, but that was it. No - not an athlete, but I was very fit during my teens and then again during my 30s. I don't know if that was enough to affect my heart rate or whether I was just born this way. I'm certainly no athlete now - but am probably fitter than I look!   ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am 56 and overweight but, until I started Letrozole about three weeks ago, I had a very slow heart rate. It was so slow that I was sent for an ECG at my pre-op, and it was in the mid-40s even though I had just walked down a corridor to get to the correct place and was quite stressed. None of the medical people I have seen in the last 15 years or so have battered an eyelid over this, although they always test my pulse several times to check their reading is correct and, during my op, I was given a drug to speed my heart rate up as a precaution. Now my heart rate is all over the place. I wear a fit bit, so can check my heart rate at any time. I'm sitting at the computer now and within the last few minutes it's gone from 68 to 85 for no apparent reason. A few weeks ago, it would have been low to mid-50s sitting here. Mild exercise, such as walking the dog, sends it soaring to a rate I would have experienced only when running before.   Has anyone else experienced this? I suppose my heart rate is more normal now, so perhaps it's fine. On the bright side, it might be speeding up my metabolic rate too!!  ",

      "Content": "Hi Plym,  I am on the 3rd of my 4 Taxol sessions. I have them at 14 day intervals. The first two followed the same pattern. The bone pains started half way through day 3, were pretty bad that night and for the following 48 hours and then gradually decreased. I'm on day 2 now, so am expecting the pains to start tomorrow. My infusions are full strength, but I would imagine that you are on a lower dose, so hopefully you won't have the pains for as long. I think the trick is to rake the painkillers before the pain takes hold and to keep taking them. I switched between paracetamol, ibuprofen and co-codomol.",

      "Content": "I was put on Letrozole at the end of 2015. Within a very short period of time I developed pretty bad floaters and flashing lights in both eyes. One eye went and then , a couple of days later, the other eye went. I saw an eye specialist, as there was a risk of a detached retina. He told me that there was no connection between what had happened and the Letrozole and he made no mention of the Letrozole in his letter to my GP. I have heard others raise the question as to whether there is a connection. It seems to me that the experts have their minds already made up and, consequently, no data is being collected which might prove a connection actually exists. On a separate note, I am currently going thro8gh chemo and the floaters are much more noticeable again. I find them very upsetting.",
