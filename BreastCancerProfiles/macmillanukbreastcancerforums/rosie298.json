    "Content": "Hi this is my first time postign here.  my mum was diagnosed 3 weeks today with breast cancer but found out last week that its at stage 3 and grade 3 but what does this mean? does it differ person to person? all shes been told is its an aggressive form with 3 or 4 lymph nodes affected but still treatable and the surgeon and consultant remain optismistic which help keeps my mum poitive. im 28 and my mums 64 and i still live with her, due to having physical problems myself( i have mildcerebral palsy and epilepsy). they wont know how deep large or how many lymph nodes are affected until they open her up and remove it. unfortunately shes had it since sept/oct if not eariler and didnt do anything til january because she though it was a cyst. she isnt scared or so she says, she doesnt feel scared or that shes going die (think my dad whom she is seperated from, thinks this). to her its just something she has to get through. people around her and myself are the ones who have been falling apart and \"why are you so calm and collected\"...but she admitted she doesnt feel it now... as surgery date is gettin evercloser (mon 11th march). i think i  must seem quite detached from it. she thinks that ive taken my coping vibes off her(she hasnt fallen apart so i havent) but i cant say that, if she had reacted at all in floods of tears, my reaction would have been any different to what it was. i kind of resigned myself i wasnt surprised at all :( id had a gut feeling fr 2 days prior tha it wasnt good news so i was just \"oh well\". i feel calm, uncertain yes- but i feel calm and positive and believe my mum will get through this. so many of our friends have had it and survived, or fought it and passed from it years later - in 1 case 20yrs.  my mum does feel if it wasnt for me nagging her(i had been on/off talking about cancer/breast cancer all of 2012 as someone at work is going through a second reoccurance of the beast) and shed have left it til next mammogram 2014, it would of been a totally different outcome so ended up thanking me. a very close friend of mine passed 7yrs year ago of a reoccurance so even though i didnt REALLY know what i was checking for, ive checked my boobs since i was 21. at least now i know what a cancerous lump feels like and i didnt know-until october 2012- that leaky boobs and inverted nipples are signs too....both of which my mum had. i said \"well dont you think you should get it checked just incas \" \"nah stop worrying ill be alright i'll mention it next tme to the dr.\". as it was she \"kept forgetting\" to. she goes back in 4-5 weeks after lumpectomy for the results than its 3 weeks of mon-fri radiotherapy. we have 2 cats is she allowed to pick them up or have anything to do with them? i read in oneof the booklets that you cant touch animals cos of infection/radioactiveness etc. ive decided to do the shopping online as i do struggle physically, and 1 of our good friends(who also has had breast ca) LOVES ironing - goodness knows why lol - so my mums decided to rope her in. everyones been really helpful kind and supportive. in such a \"sad\" circumstance it does kind of restore your faith in human kind. my dad has also been very kind in offering his help too, anything she wants  done or help with, if hes stuck for a lift to/from hospital in Aberdeen then just to shout. hes offered in ways we never dreamt but then my mum never dreamt ahed have breast ca! she always thought if she was gonna have caner i wouldbe brain cos shes constantly getting migraines and has done since 11yrs old. the dr has said there will be day with the treatment with radiotherapy that she wont be able to even lift a kettle energy wise - now i took the dr (the gp, who has alsi had breast cancer)at her word(im very literally and half anticipating how exhausted she will be) but my mum thinks drs over exaggerating quite a bit: \"ohh ill just in my own time when i feel physically safe/ok to do it i wont rush into it. i f i dont hav the energy then ill just wait til you come home\" was her response. i wor part time 10-1 every day mon-fri, whats the likelihood of my mum doing stuf (or trying) for herself that she shouldnt be doing :(. im concerned she'll push herself too hard and then deteriorate in her recovery after the lumpectomy and radiotherapy treatment. i cant watch her 24/7 i know that but has there been anyone else who has only had 1 carer looking after them and tried to do things before they physically energy wise could and put their own recovery back? my mum says she wont let the cancer stop her from living her life, fair enogh but thats before the treatment starts! anyway im sorry for wafleing on. if you can make sense of this and are able to answer any of my questions to put my mind at rest that would be appreciated.   Rosie",
