      "Content": "Hi Mina. I'm in a very similar position to you, having had 8 rounds of chemo followed by lumpectomy  followed by radiotherapy. My cancer was also high grade and stage 3 but responded well to chemo. I have a horrendous lump about 1 cm above the scar with occasional pain and discomfort.  Also the whole breast feels a lot denser and heavier than the other one - and like you I've been having the same thoughts and fears about \"what if it's come back? \" I 've got my next check up in a couple of weeks I know logically there's probably nothing to worry about and I 'm guessing there are lots of women out there in the same position. . Good luck with your tests.  Xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi. Yes I'm on Anastrazole and i get the same. I would describe my hands as \"crunchy feeling\". And a general stiffness especially after sitting in one position for a while. It's a pain  - no pun intended  -but for me it seems to be the only side effect -which is such a relief after all the horrors of docetaxol. I have heard that some people get on better having the same tablet made by different manufacturers. It might be worth asking your Dr about that. Good luck with it  x",
