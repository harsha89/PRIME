I guess it's all just wait an see which is the hardest part . thanks you for your reply x",

      "Content": "hello you may remember me a while back I posted about a lump I found and it was a cyst so all was OK.  but I then found another lump in the other breast went back to doc he was horrid . I said I want a re  refral he said why would I when you've just been I said cus it's a new lump in a different breast that wasn't checked . (I only had one breast ultra sound scan ) on the left . he said oh well says in  letter here all I's OK all checked . said yes but my right breast wasn't . I had to really explain myself he was really rude I said it was right to get It checked he said it wasn't . anyway when he finally listened to me he said oh I didn't realise they never scanned the other breast I'm just reading that it says all OK . so he examined me said yes theirs  a lump but we will c if it change's come back in 2 weeks . went back today and got re  examined and they have grown (their is a few lumps  ) so he is sending me back to clinic finally. should I b worried they have grown does this sound like classic fibrocystic if that's right can't remember what he said now  as that's what he thinks they are . I'm 38,  39 next month and it doesn't run in family apart from an ant . many thanks x ",
