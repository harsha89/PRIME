      "Content": "Hi  I was diagnosed Xmas Eve , had to spend xmas with a fake smile As didn't want to tell my 3 kids until I had all the info. Fast forward to July , I've finished chemo, had surgery and start radiotherapy in 2 weeks time.  Yea there have been really crap times but generally it's been ok. I  still think the worst time was the few weeks between initial diagnosis and getting all the scans done , getting results and then a treatment plan. It's a massive shock but you will get through it !!",

However I do feel extremely bloated and have an uncomfortable slightly crampy stomach, is this normal ? I have heard that diarrhea is a common side effect but haven't suffered as yet, when does that usually kick in ? I'd just got used to the FEC effects and now there's a whole new lot to discover !!!",

      "Content": "Hi sue - glad it's not just me !!! I was told biopsies showed invasive breast cancer on Xmas eve and I am having my ct scan on 5th jan and will get results on 13th., I am terrified and convinced I am riddled with it and seem to be constantly in tears. I know that me stressing out isn't going to make any difference to the results but not sure how I just forget about it and get on with life. I too got tablets from GP to help sleep but the minute I groggily awake my mind is straight back to thinking about all the what ifs and analysing every tiny ache or pain.  I do take comfort in the fact everyone on here says these first weeks of waiting are the worse and it does get better emotionally when you know exactly what you are dealing with.  I think this time of year doesn't help - all the jollity and superficial stuff which I usually love just seems pointless and it is very hard to put on the act for others.  Hopefully you won't have to wait much longer for results and at least then you can move forward.",

I am severely claustrophobic and there is no way I can go in that machine without something strong to calm me down, preferably to knock me out cold for the whole,time ! But the surgeon said that as I would be laying face down in the scanner they couldn't put me to sleep. I did have an MRI about 15 years ago and had a total panic attack after about 2 minutes and had to come out, and I am still traumatized by it now !!!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for replies , Lucy what you have written mirrors exactly how I feel !! I initially saw GP as I had a rash on my nipple and neither the GP or breast surgeon could actually feel a lump so to be told it was so big was a major shock, at first I thought they must surely mean mm not cm's !! I have decided to bury my head in the sand re the spots on liver - the last few weeks has taught me that worrying about it won't make a joy of difference and if it is anything sinister then I will just have to cross that bridge when it comes to it.  Getting the call yesterday sent me into such a meltdown of hysteria, they said on the phone they would see me on Thursday but I just drove straight up there and insisted that you cannot phone me and say you have found something on the CT scan and leave me hanging for 2 days ! Now I know the chemo is going ahead and wheels are in motion I feel so much better able to cope, I even went to work today !!",

      "Content": "Hi, i was called up to hospital today - a week earlier than scheduled, so major panic - they told me my tumour is 6.5cm and 1 lymph node is definately affected but they don't seem to think any others are , at least they don't look like they are. The CT scan showed a couple of 1mm spots which they say are so small I need an MRI to determine exactly what they are. Oncologist didn't seem overly concerned about them - he said about 40% of people would have liver cysts but because I have lymph node affected they need to check them out. I will be starting FEC T in the next couple of weeks then assuming liver proves to be ok it will be surgery then possible radiotherapy. Feeling quite shocked at size of lump and although trying to believe liver is just stats it's pretty hard to believe !",

Since my diagnosis - was it really less than 2 weeks ago ?! - I have found late night is when I suffer from every ache and pain imaginable, at the moment it's my legs and back aching as I am utterly convinced it has spread to my bones. My partner reminding me that my legs and back didn't ache 2 weeks ago makes no difference, pains and symptoms have to start sometime eh !! Early morning is a struggle too as I wake up and the realisation hits me that it hasn't been a bad dream - this is reality .

      "Content": "Wow - the past few days have been surreal !!! I had an itchy rash on my nipple for a few weeks, went to gp, used cream for a week but no difference. Gp thought it was eczema but referred me to breast clinic just to be careful. I went there on Wednesday, mammogram showed up calcifications but no lumps so had biopsies on breast and nipple and 1 lymph node.. The consultant told me she is very sure it is pre-invasive cancer and pagets disease of nipple and one lymph node was enlarged so they are checking that as well. All a blur after that , but I go back on XMAS eve for results - great timing! Since then the emotional roller coaster has started - one minute I think it'll be fine, she said pre-invasive so a mastectomy and job done, next minute I am looking tearfully at the kids , solely focusing on my conviction my lymph nodes are full of it and wondering if I will make it to New Years eve. Every little ache or twinge and I'm convinced it's spread to my bones /brain/lungs etc. please tell that I'm not going mad on top of everything else and that everybody felt like this ??!!",

      "Content": "Well - the roller coaster continues ! got the results of biopsies today, invasive breast cancer apparently a lump about 4cm , lymph nodes was inconclusive so they have repeated the biopsy today and weirdly the nipple rash is not showing anything. Neither my go or breast surgeon could actually feel any lumps when I went in initially so I am amazed that it is so big and that the rash appears to of been a red herring, thank god for it tho else I would never of seen a doctor. i now have a ct and mri scan booked for 5th man and am awaiting date for bone scan. My suspicious mind automatically assumed this meant they had concerns it had spread but they assured me the scans were normal procedure. They said it was grade 2 cancer but that they don't do staging  - but I am sure I have read other peoples acing what their stage is so I am now paranoid they are just electing not to tell me as it's such bad news - paranoid ? !! if it hasn't spread anywhere then they think it will be chemo followed by surgery then radiotherapy, seemed like an awfully serious treatment plan but they said due to my age (44) they tend to do the lot. Again my paranoia is telling me this is unusual so would love for someone else to tell me to stop feeling so special and everyone get the same.  So ladies, looks like I'll be in this club for a while ! Have decided not to tell kids, mum etc until I get the full results on 13th jan, my partner has been fab and my best friend who has beaten lymphoma in the past 2 years is helping me to rationalise things and not jump to horrible conclusions. ",
