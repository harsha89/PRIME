      "Content": "Hi there, I had surgery for breast cancer end of last August followed by Radiotherapy. I still experience a lot of pain in my breast, unlike nerve pain, especially at night if I change position the pain wakes me up and seems to be on both sides of where I had the incisions. My BCN has got me an appointment with the oncologist on Monday .I wondered if anyone else experienced this and if it was adhesions and what can be done about it?",

      "Content": "Hi there ,Im new to the group .Had WLE on 27th August and lympe  node biopsy. Going back for results on Thursday.I was already told after original biopsy Id definitely have to have radiotherapy and that my cancer is oestrogen + so will be having hormone therapy too. I'm generally a very positive person but my emotions seem to be on a roller coaster. Dreading the results. My main concern at the moment is that my wounds are still very tender.I didn't get a discharge letter after surgery .It's now 13 days post surgery, I seem to have been glued and have lots of steri strips over the wounds, so many I cant make out which way, or how many incisions I have. I've been changing the dressing myself. Should I Have removed the dressings and steri strips at this point? I also had a horrible experience post operative .Originally I was in a gyny day center, and supposed to awake there,all women and very private, a lovely place  .However we were sent to a regular out patient department after surgery ,although I'm sure I was safe and been discharged from immediate post op care , I woke up there. The department was mixed sex and mixed day cases local anaesthetics and general anaesthetics together, So woke up in a room with men present walking about ,who'd had local anaesthetics . I felt this was  very inappropriate place to wake up in and was very upset. This was my first general and I was extremely sick after and bled everytime I sat up or was sick and felt very dizzy. Despite this I was asked to get out of bed, dressed and walk to a chair ,in front of the tellywhere everyone else was, without any help or assistance . I felt extremely vulnerable and unwell and quite traumatised by this. At discharge I still hadn't been able to eat or drink without being sick, was extremely dizzy and my wound was still bleeding when I got home. ! After being sick several times at home I crashed out on the bed ,then my partner had to wake me up because my wound was bleeding so much. Fortunately Im a medical professional and managed to stem the bleeding and redress my wounds .I had only been given 2 dressing that were the wrong size! Sorry for the rant ,still very upset by it all, but helps to share with other people and wondered if this is considered acceptable and am I possibly over reacting?",
