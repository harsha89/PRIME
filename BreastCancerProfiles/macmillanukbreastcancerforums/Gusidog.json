      "Content": "Hi, I read about fasting and thought about doing it for my weekly taxol. But the steroids made me so hungry I found it impossible and I also found that eating every 4 four hours made me feel better. My husband said I literally went white when hungry and I felt weak, then I'd eat and buck up again.  I put on 6kg!! Side effects weren't too bad so I wasn't really motivated to fast but I honestly don't think I could have done it. goid luck x",

      "Content": "Hello Sarah So sorry you find yourself here.  I don't know what sort of chemo you're having but I too was most scared of that and it turned out not to be that bad, the thought of i t was far worse than the reality.  On a practical level,maybe freeze some meals in advance, think about using the cold cap if it's on offer, plan round your chemo days but otherwise literally take one day at a time as someone else said on here. Use your time wisely, save your time for you and your family. Cancer does give you the chance to say no which I have really enjoyed! I was diagnosed and started treatment 13 months ago, i'm about to finish and still feel slightly shocked but honestly it wasn't that bad. I look back now and remember how terrified I was but I didn't need to be.  Try and do something that makes you feel good each day, if even for a few minutes. Good luck for Thursday. Sarah x  ",

Lost lots of hair but not so anyone else would know. Tell her to take a paracetamol first, grit teeth for 15 mins and after that it's fine. I had a few mild side effects with taxol and felt tired, but it's one of the easier chemos to tolerate my Drs said. good luck to your mum and you, all this is so scary but she'll get into the swing of it and find its not that bad. x",

Sometimes I had to force myself but the further I walked or the more I swam, the better I was able to cope.  Other than that just focussing on each week's chemo at a time.  In the end it flies past.",
