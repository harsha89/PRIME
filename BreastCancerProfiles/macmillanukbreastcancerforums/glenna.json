      "Content": "Hi not in this situation but may be able to shed a bit of light on the subject. Firstly treatments have developed so much over the years its amazing. My breast cancer was a form of oestrogen posative c, so prior to op etc in June of this year, I went on a trial drug, which they have used to good effect for the past 5/6 years in people where cancer has returned or spread. Therefore they were using it to see if it worked pre treatment in newly diagnosed patients to help reduce the tumour. I was on the drug for 4 weeks and it shrunk my lump by almost 2/3rds. So nowerdays some of these cancers can be reduced, possibly stoped by hormones. This may have nothing to do with your mum in laws situation but it may give you an idea of how treatments are working these days. Hope this is of some help to you. g",

      "Content": "Hi Jozeelee, I had a lumpectomy mine was a little bigger than yours. When I first saw a surgion pre op he told me that after a few months there would be an indentation in my breast and that if I was not happy with how it looked I could have some reconstruction surgery. Believe (from reading other ladies posts with same) that they remove fat from part of your body (abdomen or somehewhere) and put it into the breast. I do have a bit of an indentation,and my nipple does vear to the left a l bit. I did also notice that my operation side breast was a bit perkier (looked like I'd had it lifted) so had to work extra hard on my post op excercises on the \"good\" side to get them equal (had full lymphnode clearance as well). Especially as like you I was told by BCNurse that it would tighten up more when I get radiotherapy. Personally I cant see how \"fluid would fill the cavity\". If I closely compare both breast I suppose the opd on one is a little smaller, but I have to be naked to really notice and it dosnt bother me at all. However if you are not happy then I think you should be given the same option that I was, when you have your check up with the surgion after all treatment I would discuss this with them. Know if I change my mind its an option for me. Take care g",

      "Content": "Hi First from what I've observed working with sick kids is that everyone responds differently to any form of treatment and medication. Yes there is a general 'average' trend but who the heck is ever average? I have been on a trial drug to see if it would shrink my lump, in some cases it does in others it dosnt and part of my trial was to try and determine why it works for some and not others. They have taken different samples both before and will take more during my surgery to check the cells, my genetics etc etc. They will alos take some for another trial (just call me the human guinea pig heheh) to help see if different cells from my lump react differently to different treatments. So the fact that your lump does not appear to have shrunk is nothing to be worried about, they do these treatments, depending on the types of cancers (cos there are lots of different variations) as they may work for you and then the surgery doesnt always have to be so radical.In some cases it works but not all and they dont know who it will work for, have read posts from women on other sites for some its worked others not but at least it looks as if its stoping yours from carrying on growing because if at any point they were worried that it was spreading they would just stop it and do the op. Also seams that some people have pain but not others my lump has ached at times for no known reason although never felt anything till the doctor asked if it hurt! How you feel with chemo is very individual from what I've learnt (asked, quizzed read and generally interogated everyone) and I hope that when I start my industrial strength one post op that I feel as well as you although the being in the dumps sounds pants. However I think feeling down is all part of any serious illness and some of the medications are horrible our bodies are going through the equivalent of bomb blast so I think that is bound to beone of the side effects at some point. I hope some of this easay helps in some way and that all goes well and a year down the line this will just be a nightmare you got through g x",
