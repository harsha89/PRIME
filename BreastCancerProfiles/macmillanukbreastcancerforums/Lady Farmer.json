      "Content": "Hello. I'm using the cold cap, which makes me feel chilly during and after chemo. I was given a beautiful soft scarf/wrap, which I put around my neck on the way to and from the hospital, and I bought a pair of snuggly boots to keep my feet warm.  My lips are very dry, too, so I have several lipsalve sticks around the place. Burt's Bees do lovely ones - some are tinted. I also have a big tub of Vaseline which I use on my lips and hands overnight.  I always have something to do during all the waiting times - knitting a sock, newspaper to read on my tablet, a book, and a magazine.  Best of luck with it xx",

Maria x community.macmillan.org.uk/.../115694 As for banboo turbans try this's list www.breastcancercare.org.uk/.../hair-loss-what-to-wear I've kept much of my hair, so I'm using hats and scarves, but Claire at Chemo Headwear was extremely helpful, and a friend had beautiful turbans from Suburban Turban.
