      "Content": "Hi Kay, I also have had surgery similar to yours and have a scar to the right side of my right breast, just under my armpit, as it's been hot and wanting to let air to the area to keep it dry and help it heal I have worn shoestring strap t-shirts from day one (surgery was 2 weeks ago). Obviously it shows quite clearly, but instead of shame or embarrassment I feel pride, I had the surgery and got through it. Ok it's not beautiful, but it is a sign of fighting the cancer and winning. It will fade with time and care, either vit E oil or Bio Oil as soon as the surgical team give me the ok. I'm not a psychologist, I'm just another woman going through this, but I would say try and accept and be proud of your scar, it is a sign you have been strong and dealt with what as been set before you. Stay strong and heal well. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline, What you are feeling seems normal to me, I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS on 27th June after a standard screening appointment, my biopsy was done on Friday 13th!!! I kept telling myself they were mistaken, but knew deep down they weren't. I work in a Hospital myself in an Endoscopy unit and have had to care for patients who were diagnosed with other forms of cancer, all my knowledge and learning has not helped! I had my surgery a wide local excision on 16th July, and to be honest I still don't think it has sunk in. They have said it is contained in the duct and not affected my nodes, which is good news. The surgeon has removed 66 grams of tissue and I get the results this Thursday. Also like you I am expecting the worse, and dreading having to have more surgery. People ask me why I am expecting the worse? well, after the core biopsy I was told there was an 80% chance it would be nothing, and it was, I was told the chance were it would be low grade, it was high grade, before surgery I was told 1 in 4 women have to return for more surgery, so far my odds have been against me. So your question \"is it a normal reaction?\" Personally I would say yes. On a positive note, the surgery went well, and I am healing very well, some pain and bruising, but not nearly as bad as I expected, there is a dent in my right breast to the right hand side of my nipple, but you can't notice it when my bra is on. If I can give any post op advice, it would be to buy a couple of supportive, UN-wire sports bras and put one on right after the op and keep one on 24/7, it has help with support, swelling and discomfort when moving around. It took me 10 days to venture further than the corner shop, but was back on the motorbike with my hubby this Sunday, did me good to get out and do something normal. I have also found these groups really helpful, good to say what you really feel and not guard it to save stress for loved ones. I STILL feel shell-shocked. I'm 51 and have been pretty healthy all my life, I don't actually feel physically ill now, but the mental and emotional effects of breast cancer definitely take their toll. Be prepared for people to say some strange things, ranging from very positive to very negative stuff, I have even had someone say I am lucky it's not REAL cancer!!! I am sure they all mean well, but also be prepared for internal anger. My next step is the path results, if they show clear margins there will be 15/18 sets of radiotherapy. Hoping for the best for you, always happy to chat if you want to message me. Good luck Robs ",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee, Thank you for the reply, I guess to do start to feel a bit paranoid! And I do have lumps and bumps anew, but I have assured myself these are due to the surgery, hardening scars inside I am guessing, and that strange numbness, but not worrying about that. I have been very lucky with this first stage of treatment, I have read so many horror stories, I have had no infections, splitting, bleeding, oozing etc and am healing well. Just hoping the good luck keeps coming!! Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, Thank you, I had loads of problems with HRT a few months back, so am a little hesitant about taking any other hormones, but will take on board what the oncologist says and try and balance it all out. It is a very strange feeling now, I still have the bruising and soreness from the surgery but the cancer is gone, almost feels like it was all just a horrible nightmare! Not sure how I am supposed to feel now other than relieved. But I am sure time will heal the emotional as well. This site was an amazing place for me, helped me through some very long nights. I will keep coming here in case maybe I can help someone else. Thanks again to you and all the other wonderful ladies!! Robs xx",

      "Content": "Hi All, I had my follow up appointment post surgery yesterday, and I am so happy to say I have had the all clear!! Clear margins all round, nothing left, so no more surgery!! Just the appointment with the Oncologist to come now reference Radiotherapy, but the Consultant surgeon said it is possible it will not be necessary, and the decision for hormone therapy will be up to me. So there is a light at the end of this cancer tunnel. I wish good news for all of you. Robs xx",
