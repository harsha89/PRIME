      "Content": "I finished chemo 9 months ago and started Letrozole after rads. My hair was slow to start growing, and has come back fine and quite wispy. My big concern is that it's still very sparse on top, and I've read that some women have male pattern baldness long term on Letrozole.Anyone else have problems with slow growth and thin hair on top? I feel so well now but my lack of hair is starting to get me down. Trivial I know, but I wasn't prepared for it to be so patchy and thin.",

Am I being impatient in expecting it to grow by now? I've scared myself by reading some stuff about people with permanent baldness after Taxotere.",
