      "Content": "Hi Kay I'm really sorry to hear that.  I've recently found out (on Tuesday) that my partner has got a cancerous tumour in his neck.  What you've said really frightens me because I am so worried that I might withdraw from him down the line.  I really really don't want to, I want to be there for him 100%, but at the minute I'm so paranoid and worried about everything that all ideas have come into my head! I know you've got more problems than me so it's cheeky to ask advice, but what would you sugges are the best ways to support him?  I don't ever want him to feel as down as you are about our relationship. Are your duaghters acting up because you're ill or because they're frustrated with him?  If it's the latter, it just proves how much they care for you. Take care. x",

      "Content": "I feel absolutely terrible saying this, but I feel so disappointed in my mum.   I recently found a breast lump and went to see my GP and he referred me to see a consultant.  I never told anyone as I'm a very private person.  I'm sure most people would tell their mum something like that but we are a pretty private family, and also my parents are going away for neatly a month in 2 weeks and I didn't want to worry her without knowing if it was anything to worry about in case she said she didn't want to her on her holiday.   If there was something to worry about I'd tell her when she got back when I knew for definite.   The next day I got a call on my mobile from the lady at the bookings team.  At the end of the call she very awkwardly told me that she had called the land line on my records (this appears to have never been removed after I left home) and asked to speak to Sarah and the person on the phone said she was.  She continued to explain that it was regarding the consultation referral for a breast exam.  As she continued talking the person on the phone stopped her and said she didn't know anything about it.  That was because she was talking to my mum not me!  I'm not angry at the lady who called, she can't help that we have the same name and that my records were never properly updated.   So that left me in the position of what to do about telling my mum.  She obviously knew something was wrong so I sat for 5 minutes anxiously waiting for my phone to ring with her in a panic asking what was wrong.  A little while later and still no call so I thought I better call her.  I had decided to have my referral privately so my appointment was that night.  Now mum knew, I'd ask if she wanted to go with me.  I called 5+ times, but no answer.  She'd gone out!  I can't believe I was thinking she'd be all upset and worried about me, when obviously the news didn't even put a break in the stride of her daily plans!   So I went to the appointment on my own and the doctor referred me for a scan.  I was as white as a ghost the whole time because I was that scared but, everyone was lovely and reassuring.   Later that evening I popped round to my parents (for a different reason).  I was expecting her to corner me and ask about the phone call so I planned what I was going to say.  But nothing!!!  I know I could have mentioned it to her but she doesn't know I knew she'd had that phone call.   I cannot believe that she knows I was going for a referral and just didn't mention it.   I feel so alone and let down.  2 years ago I cared for my partner going through cancer in any shape or form.  He recovered and a number of months later we split up, earlier this year. I've never felt so alone.  I know it was my choice not to tell my mum about the appointment, but I just didn't want to worry her.  Now I know she knows but has ignored it, I'm devastated.   Luckily I went for my follow up appointment and my scan results were good, I've just got to go back in 2 months for a follow up.  Now I know I'm ok I should be relieved, but I just keep thinking how much I'm hurt by my mum.  I'm the youngest child and I've said before that I've always felt like such a last consideration to everyone, and this just proves it.  Who finds out that their 28 year old daughter is going for a referral for a breast examination and then just pops out to Asda as if nothing has happened?!   I do feel truly horrible saying this as I'm sure people will say it's my own fault for not telling her in the first place, but I had the best of intentions.   I know my mum loves me, but I just have this huge feeling hovering above my head that no one cares about me.  I'm devastated.",
