Went to dr possible trapped nerve given naproxen. Back to dr Thursday as in agony. Sent to hospital with suspected clot. Blood marker raised, had scan Friday, no clot. They've said nerve damage and given me gabapentin, said will take at least three weeks to work. Well I'm in absolute agony. I can't walk, I scream if I move. This pain is actually worse than labour. It eases a bit if I lay down so I'm pretty much confined to bed. If I get up I'm just sobbing. Any advice will be gratefully received, don't know how much longer I can go on like this Jo xx",

By the time I was seen (although was seen very quickly) the eye clinic was closed so was sent home waiting for them to call me. My blood pressure was 168/108. I need to get that down and sugar levels or I'm at risk of another bleed which will eventually take my vision. I'm so upset, probably doesn't help hubby being away.

It was a long appointment and they took down family history etc but I was told then I didnt qualify for testing but they recommended annual mammogram, which my hospital didn't agree with and never offered. When I was diagnosed in August 16 I contacted my genetic consultant. She took my email as a self referral. When I saw her she gave me the blood form there and then. Said Id jumped right up the scale by having the breast cancer at 44. Said I didn't need counselling before. Six weeks to the day she phoned me with a negative result. My aunt who has had ovarian cancer for 4 years has been offered the same test, but she's having to have counselling before they do it. I guess every hospital have their own guidelines. Good luck. Before you go write down your family history, my mind goes blank on those places!  Jo xx",

I'm feeling pretty dizzy.  This only happens to people we read about in the magazines.  I have 5 girls ranging from 9-25, I'm worrying about them.
