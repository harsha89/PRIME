      "Content": "Hi Peanut 11 I want to wish you lots of luck for the 17th. I\u2019ll keep everything crossed for you.  I am a similar age to you 54 on the 6th Dec and diagnosed on the 28th Dec with Grade 2 BC and like you ER and HER2 positive. I\u2019ve just heard that my lumpectomy will be on the 22nd Jan, then 5-6 months of Chemo, Radiotherpay, Herceptin and the drug beginning with A for 10 years. All the usual stuff.  I\u2019m most worried about losing my hair and how I\u2019ll manage to juggle self employed work, children (although one\u2019s at university), pets and all the domestic stuff. i\u2019ve been going through a very nasty divorce for over a year as my husband decided to take me to court, so I\u2019m trying to deal with that along with the diagnosis and practicalities. Like you the aggressive part is really worrying; no one medically has used that term to me, but I\u2019ve read about it.  I\u2019ve yet to meet my Oncologist and find out what I\u2019m going to have in the way of Chemo other than it will be given over three weekly cycles. i\u2019m planning to try yeh cold cap. I\u2019m also planning to go to hair loss consultants Lucinda Ellery - I have experience of thinning hair for years and started going to them a year ago and it gave me back my confidence.  Hope to hear how you\u2019re getting on and wishing you a positive journey.",

Good gracious Carolyn, what a terrible experience to go through, I'm so glad you did battle and came through.  It's been a steep learning curve for me and made me questions every step.  I think when it's our lives in their hands, we need to take control and ask questions - keep them on their toes.  I'd rather be known as a pest and get the best care, than be too accepting and not be here. Best wishes Sharpie6 x",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn Thank you so much for your reply.  It's always a great support when you lovely ladies talk sense and share. I'm not a worrier but the mistake made on the 13th December has really sowed a seed of doubt and of course, it's the fear of the unknown and the uncertainty of what lies ahead that affects us all. Anyway, on Monday I finally start my treatment along with lots of others no doubt - wishing you well Lynn and everyone else out in the MC community. Sharpie6 x",

      "Content": "Hi All My profile gives my diagnosis background - 28 Dec 2017 ER HER2+ BC. but my consultant and team overlooked a reference in the ultrasound report 13th December, to a secondary mass that needed further biopsy/MRI.  I discovered it in my notes by chance when attending my pre-op on 15 Jan as I was scheduled for a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on 22 Jan 2018.  So had second ultrasound and second core biopsy.  Radiologist told me there and then it looked identical to the first tumour was malignant and because of the overall size of both 4cm plus, I would need Chemo first and a mastectomy.  Saw consultant and he said 95% certain it was malignant and my operation was cancelled until they had rushed the biopsy results through, but said it would either be Chemo first or mastectomy. Amazingly second biopsy on second tumour only 1.5mm away from first tumour in left breast came back benign! However today I saw consultant for scan results - bone scan show 'trauma and irregularity' to rib cage.  CT scan on 19 Jan showed sclerotic bone lesions, so sent for bone scan 31 Jan andby m MRI 2 Feb. BUT I am more worried because he said they intend to remove both tumours and that the second one looks identical to the malignant one (which even I noted at the ultrasound) and although the biopsy came back benign and they 'expect' it to be okay, only histology will confirm and they may have to have me back in for second surgery and mastectomy! So I am booked in on 12 Feb to have lumpectomy (removing both tumours) and sentinel node biopsy, but really concerned that the second tumour will turn out to be BC and the core biopsy was wrong, especially given that two consultants confirmed they thought it was malignant. Sorry for the ramble but it's thrown me as I've been up in the air since the 13th December and only flagged the second tumour because I read my notes, otherwise they admitted they would have operated and had to close me up! It's been quite a rollercoaster and put back the start of my treatment. Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on the accuracy of a core biopsy result, or knowledge of one being freakily wrongly diagnosed? Thanks for reading. Sharpie6",
