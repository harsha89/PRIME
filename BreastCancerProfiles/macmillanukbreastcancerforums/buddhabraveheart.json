    "Content": "Hello Ellen, i had a mastectomy and re construction together last year in August, i had left breast removed and tissue removed from my tummy, for the reconstruction of my breast. I was in surgery for 12 hours, and things are a bit difficult the first few days, however it gets easier day by day. A year on and the breast has been fantastic,however the tummy has been a little difficult, and is still not feeling so good, im not sure which type of reconstruction your having, as im sure different types will bring different results for everyone. Also tiredness is the thing i get most frustrated with, as i have always been quite sprightly and active, i do try to push through it, and do a small amount of excersise to try and get stronger once again, i think the biggest tip i could give you is, listen to your body, rest when you need too, and treat yourself with loving kindness. I wish you every success with your surgery, and a full and healthy recovery. Regards ANGELA.",
