      "Content": "Hi LucyB, I\u2019m in a very similar situation to you in so many ways. I\u2019m a single parent with a 10 year old daughter and two parents from her class died of cancer last year, one of whom she knew very well and adored, and we went to her funeral. I know it\u2019s going to terrify my daughter. I\u2019m grade 3 with a tiny lump (<1cm) which is being removed in two week\u2019s time and I\u2019m HER2+ so chemo looks inevitable for me. I\u2019m not planning on telling my daughter until I really have to, which will be nearer chemo time, because by that time we will know everything there is to know about it so will be dealing with facts rather than if\u2019s, but\u2019s and maybe\u2019s. This also gives all the adults time to adjust which I think will help her, if she sees the adults are scared that will not help at all! I love what sortitout says, that telling her daughter after the cancer was removed felt easier than than saying it\u2019s still there, and that her daughter appreciates that. It makes so much sense and reassures me that I\u2019m doing the right thing. I have an older son who I\u2019ve already told, it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done but he took it fine and is getting on with it like me. All my fear and worry for him was for nothing, thankfully. I think that, while there\u2019s nothing good about having breast cancer, we are actually very lucky that it\u2019s early/small/low grade so I\u2019m focusing on the positives of my situation, I hope you can too. My surgeon and nurse said the entire team are very confident that they will be able to put my mind at rest after the op as all signs so far are that it hasn\u2019t spread to the lymph nodes. I\u2019m not going to worry between now and that day because worrying is not going to change anything at all, it would just ruin the next two weeks of our lives. I am also relieved that I\u2019m having the op first so have more time to prepare myself for chemo. I feel like I\u2019ve been given a breather so I\u2019m taking it with both hands. I first found my lump in July last year but the doctor sent me away then saying it just felt like breast tissue to her and to come back if it changes. It didn\u2019t feel like breast tissue to me and the lump WAS the change so I\u2019ve been worrying ever since, I\u2019m actually relieved that it\u2019s being dealt with finally and that it\u2019s not out of control like I\u2019d feared. Best of luck to you, be strong and be positive. Of course you can do this Xx",

It's a shame they can't just go straight to radiotherapy if the cancer's gone. Has that been considered? A friend of a friend had a tumour that completely disappeared through chemo, she had no surgery, did have radiotherapy and was given the all clear but she's on Herceptin so I suppose that's another line of defence that you're presumably not having? Maybe that's why surgery wasn't necessary for her?",

And my mum is not far and pretty much wants to move in lol. But in all honesty I just want to get on with in peace, if I can do school runs and cook up some food on good days I\u2019ll be happy. The rest of the time I can do nothing and suffer lol. I\u2019ve actually been quite lucky, I found out today I\u2019m getting the gentler chemo and even though I\u2019m expecting to feel crap the onco reckons I should be able to do the basics if (I don\u2019t have any major issues) and I\u2019ll be able to get myself to hospital etc so I\u2019m optimistic about getting through it. But as I say, my son is here and he drives so I think we\u2019ll cope. Onco told me about the success of Herceptin today, my surgeon had too, as far as they\u2019re concerned I\u2019ll put this behind me and get on with my life so I\u2019ve decided not to waste my life worrying about losing it, which of course was the major fear.  I think waiting till you know everything definitely helps when it comes to telling the kids, knowledge is power and it won\u2019t be as bad as the things you\u2019re imagining. When you\u2019ve got your treatment plan things start to look clearer and more positive. I told my son straightaway but I\u2019ve put off telling my daughter because 2 parents from her old class died of cancer last year (not breast) and it\u2019ll worry her. She also started a new school last week so I want her to settle in first. I will tell her the weekend before it starts that I\u2019m having chemo to stop it from coming back but I don\u2019t have it now.  I\u2019ll be thinking of you on Thursday and hoping for good results. Give yourself time to get over the shock before you decide to do anything, it is a frightening time but honestly, when you know what you\u2019re dealing with it really does get easier xx Sorry for hijacking the thread Tingk x",

      "Content": "Rainbowdreaming I\u2019m quite similar to you, I was diagnosed in March and had a lumpectomy at the beginning of April. I have a 20 year old son and 10 year old daughter, I told my son a few days later and he\u2019s much the same as me... take in the facts and crack on with it! However, 2 parents from my daughter\u2019s class died of cancer last year, one of whom she was very close to, very upset about and we went to her funeral, so the thought of telling her breaks my heart.  I start my chemo in the next week or two, I find out on Monday when and what etc. so I will tell her before chemo starts. She knew I was having surgery on my booby but didn\u2019t ask for details (unlike her) so I left it at that.  I was worrying about telling my daughter from day 1 but had decided to wait till chemo was confirmed. Then I read a comment from another mum with a 14 year old who said she told her daughter between surgery and chemo because that way she could say she HAD cancer but doesn\u2019t have it anymore and that chemo is preventative rather than treating cancer. Her daughter later said she was glad she was told that way. This reassured me that I was doing it the right way and luckily my cancer hadn\u2019t gone beyond the lump so it is true account now. Another thing I\u2019ve come to realise is that I\u2019m much more comfortable and confident about the whole situation now and so is everyone around me, so there will be much less fear in me when it comes to telling her, and in anyone else she speaks to about it. The last thing I want is for her to be scared and I know I\u2019m in a better place to reassure her now.  I hope this helps. Just wanted to add to others, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird at all to be okayish with the diagnosis. I was weirdly relieved when I got mine and knew that it was being dealt with rather than just me knowing and worrying about the worst case scenarios. I had found it in July and was sent away from the doctor without a referral, by the time I was diagnosed I was beside myself. The experts know what they\u2019re doing, once you\u2019re in their hands you\u2019re going to be fine. ",

Get the older important people out the way so you can settle down yourself, worrying about telling them just creates more stress, the fear of telling them goes when they know so is one less thing to worry about.

I knew what it would do to her and I just couldn\u2019t cope with that on top of the diagnosis and telling my kids, I felt like I was suffocating. She\u2019s fine with it all now but it did take her to come into an appointment with me and hear it from the consultant\u2019s mouth that I\u2019m lucky, this is procedure and I\u2019ll put it behind me. She has definitely taken the whole thing much harder than me and I completely understand as I\u2019m glad it\u2019s happening to me and not my kids. I worry about my mum and what it will do to her probably more than my kids, she\u2019s been through enough I thought I might hide it from everyone if I could but I was told straightaway that I was HER2+ so chemo very likely, so I had to tell them. But you\u2019re right, they know when something\u2019s up and she had been saying to people that she knew something was wrong and that I was worried about something but she didn\u2019t know what. There was a little resentment that I hadn\u2019t told her about the lump and biopsy and that she wasnt prepared but she understands that I didn\u2019t want to worry her unnecessarily. There\u2019s so many little nuances that you don\u2019t even begin to imagine when you know someone is going through this. I can\u2019t imagine what it was like for people before the internet age and access to these forums and information at your own pace from the comfort of your own home when you\u2019re ready. Being able to share and read experiences is absolutely priceless in this situation. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Restory, my situation is different to yours but I've had the same worries as you're having now, we all have so we completely understand how you're feeling. I'm a single parent of two, my eldest is 20 and his dad lives hundreds of miles away and has never been a proper dad, even when he lived with us. My youngest is 10 and she's only seen her father a handful of times in her life, the last time was about 7 years ago and we've had no contact for 6 years years now. So of course I worry about their future as I'm all they've got parentwise. Waiting for information is the most frightening time because you don't know what you're dealing with, the possibilities are endless and the mind wanders out of control. Once you have all the the facts it's easier to look forward because you know what it is and what can be done and you can start getting on with getting rid of it. I still haven't told my daughter, she started a new school last week so I wanted to let her settle there before I tell her. I've had my lump removed and all the results were great, nothing like what I was worrying about, not even close! So now I'm able to tell her I had cancer but it's been taken out and the chemo is to stop it coming back. I've also realised that after having those weeks to come to terms with it myself and having all the facts, I'm much calmer and confident about everything so am in a better place emotionally to tell her. If I'd told her at the beginning I would have been a mess and probably would have terrified her. You know your daughter better than anyone else and you will find the best way to tell her. Try not to think that far ahead at this stage, concentrate on one thing at a time which for you right now is getting the biopsy results. My BCN told me to take it one step at a time when I was racing ahead with if's but's and maybe's, it was the best bit of advice I've had. Try to concentrate on one thing at a time otherwise it quickly becomes overwhelming. Best of luck to you, I hope you get good results from your biopsy xx",

My daughter (10) has never had chickenpox and my mum doesn't remember me having them but we've both been exposed several times over the years, don't know if that's even relevant lol.  Has anyone else had exposure to chickenpox mentioned specifically?

I've called the surgery (my daughter has a different surgery to me) and they're more concerned about getting someone else to do it because they don't want to pay for it!!! They're trying to get her sent to hospital for it?!?! I'm waiting for them to call back, if they try to wriggle out of it I'm going to point out that my daughter has been registered with them for 6 years and has had less appointments than that over those years and only one prescription, all her vaccinations were done before she was registered there so I don't see why it's a problem to pay for this one now! What is wrong with these people, Superdrug is selling them for £65 so they can't be that expensive.",

Since being diagnosed I don\u2019t like to rely on luck lol, the way my luck\u2019s been this will be the year she gets chickenpox! I\u2019m just disgusted that their priority is to waste time trying to worm out of paying for it, it\u2019s shameful and I\u2019m going to tell them that! I\u2019ve got a bee in my bonnet about it now lol x",

      "Content": "Make a fuss, do it! I was sent away by a locum GP (I didn\u2019t know was a locum) without a referral because \u201dit feels like breast tissue\u201d, this delayed my diagnosis by 7 months. The locum said to come back if it changes and because I felt it daily for 4 months I couldn\u2019t notice the change, after 3 months of strictly not touching it I realised it was bigger. I was so worried throughout that time I can\u2019t believe now that I never went back, it seems insane now but I didn\u2019t want to make a nuisance of myself or seem neurotic somehow. Now I wish I was neurotic! Luckily those 7 months don\u2019t seem to have made much difference but my advice to anyone would be to make that fuss if you\u2019re not happy, it\u2019s not worth the risk not to, and in some cases earlier detection can mean no chemo xx",
