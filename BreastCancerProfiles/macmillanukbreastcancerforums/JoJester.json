    "Content": "Hi, I have a PICC line and I have found it really helpful. Had a bit of trouble getting it in my right arm so went to radiotherapy and had it put in my left with no problems. District nurse comes each week to flush and change dressing. I hate needles, its so much easier for bloods and for chemo. I understand a lot more comfortable too. Was a little sore on entry sight but best all round for me, Good luck x",
