      "Content": "Hi Dreamtheif, thanks for your response very knowledgeable  Loving the preaching to the already converted!!! Yes I'm pre-menopausal  i think it's anything under 0.2mm it's isolated cells, anything over that it's Micrometastase? It's such a grey area but still confused as any cancer on lymph node can spread but let's hope chemo has taken care of it.  Ive just started my radiotherapy, they are only centring on the breast no under arm. And it's for 21 days I think 6 of them will be a boost. Just wanted to to know if anyone started Tamoxifen during radiotherapy, before or after as I've been told it's at the end and I finished chemo the 1st June.  Best wishes,  Sims xx",

      "Content": "Hi All, ive joint you all a bit further on from my diagnosis. but still needing support always anxious and the rest. here we go: I was diagnosed back in November (17th) 2014.  I had WLE on the 23rd December and back in for clear margins in January didn't find out till later that I also a bit of DCIS which is apparently common. Final diagnosis is IDC 22mm, grade 2. Stage 2a, ER 8/8 PR 8/8 HER-2 negative I had SLN with one micromet on H&E 0.7 so stage is PT2N (mi). I finished FEC-75 on the 1st June. I (wasn't too bad for me didn't have many side effects) was on a waiting list for radiotherapy of 3 weeks which I finally started on Tuesday, so I will receive  my 3rd treatment today. Then at the end I will receive Tamoxifen.  Whist on chemo I was receiving Zoladex which I think they still want to continue I will find out next week.  Would like to hear from anyone with similar diagnosis and if anyone knows more on micromets. As I was still told it's a negative node but the hospital still treat it as a positive mode hence the reason for being Stage 2A I dont understand as I still see it as cancer on th lymph node. I get hot flushes which wakes me up at night, due start work soon which I'm looking forward to as 7 months at home has been awful need normality if anything my sanity as you always go into a dark place. ive got so much question to ask but it's my first post and it's so long already I'll save some later. Thank you all in advance for listenin!! forgot to say I've just turned 48 Sims xx  ",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your comments. i won't contact anyone today, as I see the Onc for Chemo on Wednesday so I will raise it then.  Just received letter for my first Mammogram in September, 9 months from my operation. Smoothie - good luck with chemo I had Fec 75 you could cold cap with that one as you dont loose your hair, I didn't but a lot of ladies did & their hair was saved. I had sickness at first but it was controlled and wasn't sick again I had no mouth ulsers & didn't loose my eye brows or lashes. All i had was a bit of constipation at the start but was sorted, but I couldn't eat much, I lost so much weight and still not put loads back on and of course the tiredness & fatigue. I would never like to do it again but it wasn't so hard for me it helps if you ask them to slow it down when the chemo is being administered. It does fly past when you think about my treatment was delayed for the 5th treatment as I didn't use a picc & they didn't like the look of my veins as they came up, had one fitted in for the last one.  Wishing you all the best.

I received this letter Saturday emailed BCN she said I'm not to worry as I will be given it, as sometimes it can interfere with radiotherapy. This doesn't sit right me so I will contact my GP tomorrow with the secutary for the Onc.  thanks again Genny, loving this group already x",

      "Content": "Hi Hawkster,  im so like you from time to time.  Think for me being at home on my own as my Son & partner work and friends & family, your left with your thoughts.  I see a psychologist from the hospital and it helps. Funny that though I was the strong confident person always giving people advice they would always come to me. I couldn't understand why people would pay to talk to a stranger but I do get it now.   Loved hearing everyone's advice & I will hold on to some of it myself. it might be good to contact breast cancer care & speak to 'someone like me'. I did and she had same diagnosis 4 years ago, she says it gets better and that you even forget you have had Cancer (hope so) also she volunteers and goes to talks & seminars on BC. I've spoken to twice throughout my treatment and others who were diagnosed 15 and more years which gives me hope. I think once we start to get busy in our lives again it will move to the back of our heads then without realising it, it would go may pop up only for a short visit when we hear, read or see  it. My BCN always says to me remember it's gone. and when I visit the hospital my Oncologist always tells me that her mother is doing well 7 years on. Again giving me hope xx",

Im sure many of you have had to answer this before or maybe I'm looking into it too much. Sims",
