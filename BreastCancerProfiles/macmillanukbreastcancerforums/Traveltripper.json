      "Content": "I found Cherry Coke ok for a while. But you will find tastebuds chain all the time. I now still drink red wine where I hated it before and only had white or Rosa. it took about 4 months for me after chemo to drink tea again. It\u2019s goid you can drink water as I loved it before chemo but could hardly drink anything during it. Again this took about 3 months to come back, i bought lots of fruit drinks but I could that also changed weekly.  Goid news taste buds do come back, don\u2019t worry if the changes are permenant. You will enjoy food and drink again",

      "Content": "I finish 6 chemo Fec last July. I did find the first 3 ok, was lucky that the steroids made me hipa, like a juracel bunny. The last 3 laid me on my back for about a week after each lot. Cold cap worked a bit, was pleased I kept to it, but my hair still went patchy, but I kept some length. You have done so well, and I had those moment of why am I doing this when it\u2019s only a precaution? My family just kept saying how proud they are of me for going through all of this, A\u2019s they want the best outcome in the end to happen. It\u2019s still not easy as had radio therapy afterwards and now on Letrozole which I am having difficulty with. Have met many people who are alive still after over 15 years ago going through all of this. They are living life to the full. have also had lots of bad news this year with those all have died of cancer of all types. The pain of the people they have left behind is hard to watch, so for those people who have lost their fight, I am going to continue in their memory to continue too fight, and hopefully let my family not have to have and feel the gab of me giving up, hopefully giving them more time not to have this sadness. it is hard and unless you go through this mo one can fully understand. Just think  just under 3 months and it will be done. ",

      "Content": "Fully understand, I used the cold cap and still got the patch but kept quite a bit, but it goes so fine. Like baby hair. Plus you cannot colour it or style it. Still my hair looks clammpy. However I already had decided I would rock the wig, so I got some great wigs from Wickford in Essex, only £18. Everyone forgets I even have one on most of the times. I went longer than my normal hair and got compliment more than before.  I know I will be wearing them for another 8 or more months. Have had some cut short when they have gone tatty, but no one takes any notice. i got my normal hair colour and got aurburn and and change how I feel on the dauphinois, even got a blonde but not brace enough yet lol. i was told not to have the cold cap for the last chemo encase I got a burn, but I knew I would\u2019ve ok, as only you know your own body. Was told I would lose my hair even by missing one, no way was I going to give up, so they padded the patch area and let me continue. You have a voice so use it, it\u2019s your body. However if you decide not to continue the cold cap, then go for the wig option, it makes you feel \u2018normal\u2019. Hair is a bit rubbish even if you keep it, getting ready in the morning is quick with the wig, no hair washing etc and no drying. Takes longer to do eyebrow an eye liner, but you pick up speed lol.",

      "Content": "Have trouble getting to keep to one make of Letrozole to keep side affects to the minimum, but cannot seem to get a pharmacy to keep this make in stock. They say they have to just get whatever the supplier sends. How am I to keep to one make? Anyone know his to get this make? Willing to travel. Getting desperate and frustrated.",
