    "Content": "Hi Claire, I had similar side effects as you, and it seemed to take 7-8 days to start feeling \u2018normal\u2019 again.  When I saw my oncologist I told her how I felt afterwards and she adjusted the anti sickness medication and the steroids so I was as bad the with the 2nd cycle.  I also started the constipation medication 2 days before the 2nd cycle.  I\u2019ve just completed my 4th cycle and feel very tired but can function all be it slowly !!  I hope you start feeling human again soon xx",
