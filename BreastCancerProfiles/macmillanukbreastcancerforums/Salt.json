    "Content": "I am also a teacher, I have just had my last chemo 2 weeks ago. Your pay depends on how long you have been working. I was quite well with the first 3 chemos but the last 3 have been more difficult in terms of tiredness and feeling nauseated. I had the first chemo 6 weeks after removal of my lymphs nodes. At the time I managed my daughter's 20th birthday but after the 2nd chemo I probably couldn't have done so. I wish you lots of luck and courage. Sylviex",
