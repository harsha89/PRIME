      "Content": "Hi I started to notice my hair falling out on Saturday ( day 11 after 1st FEC ) by Monday night I it was coming out in handfuls at the front, so went last night and had it all shaved off.  I have found it great getting it all off rather than watching it coming out in handfuls. I got a wig but really don't like the feel of it on and I have always had very fine hair and the wig just isn't me. So today I wore an elasticated scarf. Was quite a day, going into work, out for lunch, corner shop and Tesco. Meeting people who didn't know I had cancer was awkward.  But am quite proud of myself , I think if I hadn't of went out I maybe never would! Came home to find my new hair piece delivered.  It is a hair band with hair all the way around it.  It needs styled by hairdresser and I might add a few blond highlights, but am so pleased with it.  Will be so handy under a baseball cap or beanie.   I got it free from Heathers Hair (google it). Tonight I am sitting watching tv with bh and kids with no scarf or wig, and we are all happy with it.  Life is good x",

I can honestly say I never saw anyone noticing.  Everyone comes in all shapes and sizes!   Every night before I go to bed, I ask my bh, well what do you think of boob tonight, it lets him and me get used to looking at all the changes.  My 2 teenage kids have also seen the changes and are quite happy, they do still call me \"titty smurf\" with all the blue dye. So, I ramble lol But what I am trying to say is, never feel ashamed, look how brave you have been and how far you have come, your children are enjoying the time with you, you should be one proud mamma..",
