      "Content": "Hi. Sorry to hear of your fears. My wife is in the same leaky boat and rapidly losing what she was very proud of , her hair. She too has a wig and scarves, and has taken to wearing a scarf at home even in front of me. It is a difficult thing for a woman in particular, but I see the wig or scarf as a badge of honour, a battle scar against cancer. Knowing some good is being achieved, and that it is a temporary superficial effect helps a little. Go to the wedding with pride. Don't be ashamed or afraid or your daughter will pick it up. Hold your head high my friend. 'When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, and don't be afraid of the dark' Peace David",

      "Content": "Chris my wife is in the same boat. She had breast cancer in 2001 which ws treated, and now its revisited in her liver being diagnosed June this year. She has been told that it is not curable, but treatable. She has just finished a course of 6 chemotherapies of taxotere. Therefore I would wish you and you sister and family all the luck in the world. I suggest she asks about taxotere, and whether 'terminal' means treatable, which can prolong life. May I wish you, your sister and family all the luck in the world. God Bless. Dvid",

      "Content": "Hi. My wife, Carol has just taken her second chemo with taxotere. She had steroids to assist with the possible side effects, and to be honest she has not had too many problems up to date. Her second chemo was tuesday. Her mouth and gums did get a bit sore, but you can get mouthwashes to assist. Her taste ws a bit strange, so I made smoothies and she ate pineapple to help. Her hair is thinning, but we have scarves and a wig ready. She is drinking copiously as she started to get a urinary tract infection, but this may have been a coincidence. All in all the side effects are not to bad so far. The steroids keep her awake most if not all of the night, so we put the bedroom TV on. I use the spare room to get some kip!! I wish you the best of luck with it, don't be afraid, and each side effect can be countered in the main. So what if the hair and nails go (which is unlikely) they will grow back. Take strength from the good the drug will do, be positive. Best wishes DavidC",
