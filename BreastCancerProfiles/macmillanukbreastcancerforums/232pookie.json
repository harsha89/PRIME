      "Content": "Hi chloecat45 When I started on Letrozole the brand was Accord which I found to be ok, then about 6 months later I noticed the brand was Manx which I couldn't get on with.  I got my GP to make sure I went back to Accord. That suited me for many months but gradually succumbed to more side effects than before.  My consultant gave me the choice of changing to Tamoxifon or Anastrozole, so I opted for Anastrozole on a trial period.  I'll persevere with fingers crossed. ",

Has anyone on Anastrozole had any trouble since taking them?",

No wires,  no padding, no hooks.  They are soft but at the sametime gently supportive..  I still wear an ordinary bra if I go out but I still wear the crop bra around the house and find them very comfortable for sleeping in.  I hope you find a solution.  ",

      "Content": "Good morning Susie.  Like you, I was diagnosed with stage 1, nearly 2 years ago.  It came as a shock because i never felt  the lump neither my GP but went for my 3 year mammogram, and bingo!  I had 15 sessions of radiotherapy and put on Letrozole because i had gone through the menopause.  Once you get over the shock, everything will take it's course and you will gradually start to feel better .I'm not saying it's  plain sailing because everyone is different, but you will soon  come to terms with it.  I came to the decision that it wasnt going to hinder my everyday life.  Be strong . All the best X",

For the 1st year, I had no trouble at all so I thought it was going to be great for 5 years..Wrong!  I started having joint pains everywhere.  Luckily all my joint pains didn't happen all at once, one day it was knees, next it was ankle and hip pains, etc. It was as though I was on a roundabout.  I eventually saw my oncologist and she changed my medication to Anastrozole hoping it would be better.  I have been on this for 6 weeks and so far, I have different problems.  I am having pains and tenderness in my ribs, on and off.  Shoulder pains going to right elbow, more back ache. I am due my 2nd mammogram in June with a follow up appointment with my oncologist, so I shall see if there is something else to try.  These things are sent to try us!  Keep smiling, there isn't  much else to do.
