      "Content": "I am 42 years old, a single mom of 3 children under 12, and recovering from Early Stage Breast Cancer. I was diagnosed on 4th November 2013 with DCIS having discovered a large (8cm) lump in my right breast at the end of September. I opted for immediate reconstruction using an expander implant at the time of my mastectomy. The operation was on the 6th December. I was in theatre for 3 1/2 hours and was in hospital for 4 nights before returning home to the care of my mom and then friends who have taken such amazing care of me. The operation went well and my recovery has been straight forward. On 19th December, I was given the awesome news that all cancer had been removed during the operation. There was no evidence of invasive cancer at all in the tissue or lymph nodes. The only slight hesitation is that due to the proximity of the lump to the skin, the usual margins were not attainable under the skin so I am returning to the hospital tomorrow to see an oncologist who will discuss options regarding radiation treatment if necessary. Personally, I am leaning towards the \"do nothing\" option at this point as we're talking millimetres but I shall remain open to discussion tomorrow. Furthermore,  I have been a bit bowled over by the limited mobility and constant aching pain since my op. I am currently taking 3 different painkillers and can't imagine lessening the dose for a while yet. I am 5 1/2 weeks post-op so am a bit concerned that the pain is still gnawing at me. It is very gradually fading but I stil don't feel confident to drive yet, for example. I wonder if anyone else has been on this path and has any wisdom to share?",

      "Content": "Hi Alison Thanks for getting back to me. I am doing the arm exercises but haven't progressed to the 2nd stage exercises yet as there was no way I could consider raising my arm above my shoulder initially. I might give those a tentative try today... I noticed that the exercises were designed for post-mastectomy and as I have had the reconstruction at the same time I was wary to rush into anything too strenuous. Hopefully I'll have a clearer head after my appointment this afternoon. Cheers",

      "Content": "Having seen the oncologist yesterday I am pleased to report that He and I are of the same mind: that to do nothing is best. I came away feeling very grateful that I have managed to avoid any further treatment and having read through some of the discussions here, totally take my hat off to so many of you ladies who are so bravely soldiering into the unknown right now with surgery, plus radiation, plus goodness knows how many drugs they can throw at you.  God bless girls. My prayers are with you all x",
