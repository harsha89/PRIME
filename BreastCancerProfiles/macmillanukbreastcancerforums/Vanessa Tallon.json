    "Content": "I had a masectomy 4 years ago. I found a lump in my left breast and went straight to the doctors. I was refered to hospital who did tests. A doctor told me i was fine and to go home and enjoy life. A week later i received a phone call asking me to come into the hospital to see the doctors. To cut a long story short i was told i had cancer and would need a masectomy. I was stunned to silence. The doctors kept talking but my mind was rushing. Within 1 month i had the op(blood pressure was too high and needed to be bought down). The recovery was a nightmare because things were going wrong. I was not healing properly and had to go to my doctors surgery twice a day to have my dressing done amongs other things. It took nearly 6 months to get well. Now i have an appointment for a scan on my remaining breast and the fear that is running through me is making me ill. I know that there are no lumps etc because i check myself daily. I have been talking on a website with friends about this and one of them said to google support groups to talk to others who have been through what i have. I know this is silly that i feel i am the only one who has gone through this. I also feel i should not say out load how i feel incase i am told to not talk rubbish. It as taken me 2 days since joining to write something as i feel a fraud by not needing any other treatment after my op and there are others going through hell. I am sorry for waffling on like this.",
