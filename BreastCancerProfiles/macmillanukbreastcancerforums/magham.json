    "Content": "I had my second round of Taxotere/Herceptin on the 24th following three rounds of FEC and like you have experienced terrible pain all over my body. It felt like my whole body was being crushed. I also had stomach cramps and diarrhea (as well as mouth ulcers and bloody nostrils). Lying in bed gave me no relief from the aching bones and muscles. I was told that this cocktail would be easier but, like you, I feel that it is much worse. It does get better though and today the pain has eased a lot - this happened on day nine last time too. So please hang in there Jo. I too felt very down as I had not expected to be in such pain but now that it getting better, I am feeling a lot happier again. I found that a hot water bottle and warm baths were very comforting. Hope that your symptoms begin to ease off soon. Take care Mag",
