      "Content": "Hey guys, A little worried because I have recently found a lump in my chest. I do box semi-professionally and obviously use my chest muscles quite a lot for punching, pressups, weights, etc. However this lump feels quite hard, I know the picture is hard to see because of the flash, but the lump is about 4cm long and 1cm wide, kind of like a quarter of a pencil size. It's not 'hard' but it is also not soft, it is kind of like a solid rubber feeling. I am going to doctors but am not home for 12 days, so was hoping someone could offer advice as to if this could be serious (I know the 100% worst case senario would be cancer) or just muscle related. I don't mean the horizontal bump across the top of my chest, I know what that is. I mean the verticle one on the right side... I realise it is hard to see in that pic Thanks guys...
