      "Content": "Oh you poor thing! I guess you're on FEC, are you? I was sick with that as well (fortunately, I switched to Tax after 3 FECs - no sickness with Tax (although plenty of other stuff!)) - first treatment, sick once; second treatment, sick as a dog for a couple of days; third treatment, felt gooey the evening after the chemo, but then fine. The difference? I didn't drink much at all after the second treatment, as I felt so rough - big mistake! The nurses told me to drink and drink and drink, which I did for the third treatment - as well as taking 6-hourly Domp - and I really do think that both tricks kept the sickness under control. (I do find it a bit odd, though, that we're told to flush the chemicals out through drinking - aren't they supposed to do their job first?) As you mention, though, the downside with Domp is the constipation - I'm afraid I learnt to live with piles, although I also tried Movicol (I found the problem was always that it took a couple of days to work and then I suffered diarrhoea for days. I'm sure, though, with a bit of sensible planning, I could have got the timing right) but I keep up the fruit and fibre too - doesn't fix it, but I thought it was a less horrible side-effect than the sickness. Hope you find something that works for you soon, Michelle",

      "Content": "I guess it's a bit late to be making this point, but I've now had 3 FEC and 3 Docetaxels (last one done this Tues - woo hoo!) and I found my first Docetaxel was pretty grim. I don't know what your worst effects were - and I've read on this forum that many women have suffered far more than me - but I was doubled-up with aches and pains for a couple of days, like a really bad case of flu aches and twinges (mostly in the most sensitive orifices!) that just went on and on; I couldn't sit still, couldn't sleep. My bloods seem to have survived better on Docetaxel than on FEC. When I told the nurse when I went in for my second Docetaxel, she asked if I'd kept up the steroids. I hadn't taken the whole lot because I hadn't needed them with the FEC (and no one warned me that Docetaxel would be any different). The nurse recommended that I take the lot and a couple more to make them last an extra day. That really did seem to do the trick; I still had some aches and pains but they were so much more bearable. I'm doing the same again for this third treatment (I find the aches usually start about now) - I'm getting some twinges, but hopefully the steroids are going to work their magic again. As I say, I realise you've already had your dosage dropped - the nurse did say I could have that, if I really did struggle with the side-effects - but maybe worth asking about your steroid back-up for the next time (and I thought my experience might help others facing the same issue). But like others have said, I do tend to trust those guys to do whatever they can to give you the biggest zap without taking it too far and they pretty-much rely on us telling them what it's doing to us, so you seem to be on the right path to me. All the best, Michelle",

What reading posts on this site has taught me is that everyone's experiences are completely different... and call me a bit of a masochist, but in some ways the unpredictability brings something to the whole experience (I've had different effects to different degrees every time, some that even baffled the nurses) - delightful, I appreciate, if the experiences lessen with each treatment, not so fun if things turn the other way, but hey ho, I guess we all have our ways of coping.

      "Content": "Hi there I've had 6 chemos now (3 FEC, 3 Tax, last one last Tues) and my periods stopped at around chemo 3 (I'm 43). I also get hot sweats, but I'm not sure if it's the chemo, the steroids (they do seem to give me a flushed chest, the nurses put it down to the steroids), or I'm menopausal... so I'm afraid I'm not going to be much help in finding the answer! One silver lining for me is that pre-chemo I was on iron tablets (GP-approved and top strength) as my periods were heavy. I kept up the iron pills post-chemo and my red blood count has kept strong. I have now dropped to over-the-counter iron sachets (as I don't want to take too much iron) as I'm no longer having periods, and that seems to be working almost as well. Just thought I'd mention it while we're on the subject. Oh another couple of bonuses: no more monthly migraines or bad moods - a rare treat for my family too! I'm afraid that I'm just going to see what happens in the next few months... and hope that if I do get a surprise, it doesn't happen on a long train ride or something! All the best, Michelle",

It seemed to me that the rate of shedding was given a boost when I switched from FEC to Tax - maybe those of you who have seen new growth whilst still undergoing chemo are on FEC alone? I also wonder if my grow-back would have been more significant had I not used a cold cap - at the very least, I guess I might be able to spot the new growth. I don't regret using the cold cap - I've only just started wear headgear - but I'm also getting impatient now.",

      "Content": "Hi Sue - sorry for the delay in posting this (this blinkin' site!). I also had a teeny lump so I had hoped that the sentinel node biopsy would mean no more surgery, but one of my three nodes was infected so I also had to go back into hospital for the full clearance. I had mixed emotions when I was told that none of the nodes taken out in the second op were infected, but with hindsight of course I'm glad the op was done and relieved with the result. Like Jim's Girl, I felt sad about it too - the breast care nurse had already put the fear of God in me about getting an infection in my node-cleared arm, I had images of living a completely different life post-op. I was in hospital only for one night; the drain was taken out in the morning. I had what I thought could have been post-op seroma, some swelling under my arm; I went to the docs about it and came out feeling a bit silly, nothing to worry about. I've had no swelling suggestive of lymphodoema since; I'm conscious of the risk, but haven't really changed my habits much (one of the only advantages of the chemo is that I have no underarm hair, so I haven't had to worry about taking something other than a razor to it yet). I would echo what Jim's Girl said - keeping up the exercises is really important. The first time I did them, I thought \"I'm never going to get all my movement back!\", but it does come back; it's now pretty-much as mobile as it was before the op. All the best for your visit to the breast care nurse and beyond, Michelle",

All I can say is that you sound like where I was back in June this year - I'd had the lumpectomy and lymph node clearance. I had my last dose of chemo last week and I'm seeing the oncologist tomorrow about radiotherapy. It's a long old trudge, but you'll find this forum is peppered with people going through the process - and it does bring a smile to my face to read when someone has said \"woo hoo, last step!\" I'm afraid I won't answer your qs - I haven't been the ideal patient when it's come to the lines (I didn't follow the nurse's recommendation to have a line in, which I don't regret although my veins have struggled), so I don't feel qualified to comment; and chemo is just so individual, where do I start?! Even my own side-effects change from one treatment to the next, so I'm not sure learning of my personal experience would be any help at this stage (I have found the forum very helpful to double-check when things have cropped up). All I wanted to say is: you WILL get there, and in a few months' time, you'll be in my shoes responding to another new joiner's anxious plea. Michelle",

The veins in my hand started to turn red after the 4th chemo, I think, but they'd returned to normal before the 5th chemo. However, after the 5th chemo they went red and my hand became swollen. Eight weeks on and my hand is still swollen, although my red veins have calmed down quite a bit. The swelling is bad this morning - I couldn't close my fist.

In the early days, the nurses recommended that I have a portacath fitted (as I'm having herceptin for a year), but all they warned me about was some \"discomfort\", so I thought I'd stick with the canula. They now use a canula in my wrist (although I've about made my mind up that I'll resort to a portacath) and have given me no helpful advice about my hand (I will pester them some more at my next visit).

It makes me wonder at some people's survival instincts! Or, more likely, the delusion of the writers that feel that there are women would would avoid screening, preferring to take the chance that they're one of the lucky ones that doesn't get struck by this thing. The item also states: \"These women will be treated unnecessarily for breast cancer and those treatments may result in harm. For example, women who are screened are more likely to end up having a mastectomy than women who are not screened\". That's one way to strike fear into the hearts of readers, isn't it?! However, it doesn't say that more screened women unnecessarily have mastectomies, so what's the relevance of the second statement to the first? I'll step off my soapbax now.",

      "Content": "Hello all, what do you think about the BBC report today (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20121043)? I'm guessing that most of us here have pretty-heavy duty grade cancers, so I suspect there's little risk of there having been overdiagnosis for us. My teeny grade 3 was spotted via a private healthcare routine check-up (mammograms offered from 40 years old) and I am sooooo glad that it was! It was so small (or well-buried) that the doc didn't spot it in a physical exam - I didn't have a clue about it - but it had already reached the lymph nodes. Now I'm a bit of a \"check yourself regularly and get yourself scanned if you can\" fanatic to my friends and family. As this report shows, ok, there's a risk of overdiagnosis - and I think that it's a real shame, if not downright irresponsible, that the journalists emphasise this - but I'd take that rather than the risk of a heavy-duty cancer getting a hold before the person convinces herself that she really should get this lump checked out. What do you think? Michelle",

      "Content": "Interesting - I've just received an email from Cancer Research UK, which comments on the report. The email ends: \"on balance, taking all the evidence into account, Cancer Research UK recommends that women go for breast screening when invited to reduce their chances of dying from breast cancer\", so at least they seem to be trying to counteract the \"unnecessary treatment\" scaremongering. Problem is that I guess if anyone wants to argue for more cuts in NHS treatment...",

      "Content": "I'd not really thought much about this over past months - chemo was plenty to occupy my mind - but now that I'm about to start radiotherapy, so will have to expose myself to a new team of people, I thought I'd ask. I had a sentinel node biopsy in May this year, but my breast is still blue/green, maybe slightly faded but it doesn't seem to be changing much at all. I had noticed in the blurb that I was given that the staining is usually temporary, but I was hoping that I wasn't one of the unlucky ones. Is there anyone out there who has had a lingering blue/green blob? Is there still a chance for me that it'll disappear? Michelle",

      "Content": "Thanks, kittycat Yeah, I might (I've never really consulted my BCN, we've never really \"clicked\"). When I went for my first chemo and the nurse did an ECG, she commented that it was unusual for it not to have faded by then. I'm not fussed about it - I doubt there's much can be done (I blame the fact that I'm a very single woman - not enough massaging!). Having eavesdropped on conversations on here of women undergoing/undergone mastectomies, I am grateful for what I do have, even if it's not looking its prettiest.",
