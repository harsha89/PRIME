    "Content": "my mother had been diagonosed with breast cancer. after biopsy test ( test reveals that moderately infiltrating ductal carcinoma ) earlier she had a mommography states that some suspicious maligancy and an FNAC which says no maligant cells found. my mother had been adviced to for a ultra sonography of whole of abdomen and both breast. The USG of abdomen was normal but the left breast results reveals that : 1. fibro, fatty, glandular type of breast 2. A heterogeneous SOL occupying lower quadrant encroaching upper and retroareolar regions to some extent. 3. the size of the SOL cannot be ascertained due to its valid extensions ( after biopsy test i.e it was a surgical excision the lump had swollen very much) 4. entire left breast looks heterogeneous. 5. nipple , skin look more or less normal 6. left axilla looks normal. the x ray report of chest is normal. ecg report is also normal and all other report are normal. my questions are : 1. what can be said about the stage of the cancer. 2. had it spread to other parts. 3. can it be completely cured?",
