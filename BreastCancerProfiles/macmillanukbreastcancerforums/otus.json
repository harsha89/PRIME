I personally havent bothered as you have to sit in hospital for sometime after chemo has been given and it can be painful. II just wanted the drugs and run if you get my gist. How did you get on with the oncologist today? Beccy x",

I am still getting swelling on & off and a pulling feeling around the area where the lump was removed. I havent had any infection but my scar feels lumpy my oncologist checked it out and said it was fine guess its just all part of the healing process? Have you seen your oncologist yet?   Beccy",
