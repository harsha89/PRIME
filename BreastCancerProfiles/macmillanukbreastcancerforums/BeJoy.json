      "Content": "Thank you for your advice! Much appreciated ... what kind of nail varnish do you use? What I mean ... ordinary nail vanish or is it gel based varnish? Over many, many years I used to have Gel nails. I stopped and now use nail strengthener only. So far so good! Phew though reading in the forum I will now have dark nail varnish just don't know which type of this makes sense? Thank you again. ",
