If you just search for diep and mastectomy on Facebook you will find them - they are closed groups so you need to ask to join. There are also several women on here who have had the op and am sure some will be along shortly to give you some information. Jo x",

There will normally be some sort of local cancer charity nearby , it\u2019s just finding out about them - the other thing you may find helpful is the , site www.breastcancercare.org.uk/ , if you haven\u2019t looked on there there is lots of information , plus they have a telephone service called someone like me where they will try and put you in contact with others with a similar situation. It can be a very lonely journey , but sometimes just talking to others going through similar things can help. Hope  this helps a bit Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky When my mum had breast cancer she didn't want to go through radiotherapy, so she opted for a mastectomy (no reconstruction) and subsequently had no further treatment other than Tamoxifen for 5 years, 11 years on and she is perfectly fine and happy with her decision. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2016, I asked for a mastectomy and was told it was caught early and there was no need for a mastectomy as the overall statistcs don't show much of a difference in survival rates between a lumpectomy and mastectomy. I subsequently had the WLE and was really pleased with the result, no-one would have known I had had an operation once the scar healed - however I had no clear margins so back in again, where they also, as well as the invasive cancer, found extensive DCIS which hadn't shown up on any scans etc. So back in again, clear margins but not enough for the guidelines so after my chemo (mine was HER2+, no lymph nodes so only had it so I could have the Herceptin used to treat this type) I had a mastectomy, with immediate implant reconstruction. I was so pleased to have the breast removed at this point, and I am still happy with the implant, but looking back I wish the WLE had been a success, I have a permanent reminder that I have had breast cancer and I just want to move on, yet every time I look in the mirror my nipple less implant breast is there. So it is a personal decision, but also just be aware that things don't always go to plan, 20% of WLE's result in further operations, but obviously that means 80% don't. There was no cancer detected in my removed breast either ... Hope you have found an answer to your decision, it is so difficult when you are still dealing with the diagnosis! Jo x",

      "Content": "Hello For me, I was really lucky and had a stream of family of friends who helped with various things, but not everyone has this. There are a few practical things to consider getting to and from the hospital and/or GP for blood tests - some areas have a free charity service that takes people to and from their treatment. I would also find out where you can go for your blood tests, and if you can have them at your GP see if they will come out and take them, or if they can arrange district nurses to pop in and see you, so contact your GP and local cancer charities, speak to your consultants team and work out ways to make these medical things as easy as possible. will your daughter be okay ? do you have anyone she can stay with if you end up in hospital at any time (this is just as a back-up, but again something less to worry about and will probably not happen!) you won't know how you will be until you start, everyone is so different. I was really glad to have someone with me whilst I had my treatment, but others prefer to be on their own, do you have anyone who could come along for a session with you ? Or again see if your hospital has volunteers who will buddy up with you ? try and make sure you have everything prepared at home, lots of shopping in, arrange for online deliveries, try and minimise the amount of time you have to be doing things, if you can afford it get in a cleaner for a bit. That way if you don't feel great you don't have the stress of having to do things, and if you feel okay you can spend your time resting and doing things you want to do, as opposed to ones you have to do. make sure your hospital and GP know you are on your own, my GP was great and couldn't do enough for me, but just make an appointment and ask them what they can offer you in terms of care if you don't feel great ? if you are thinking of getting a wig, get one before you start, trying on wigs when your hair is coming out is dreadful ... keep on the Macmillan Forum, and if you put where you are in the country someone may be able to buddy up with you who is going through similar things ? You will get through it, the treatment is doable, not always great fun (!) but doable. Jo x",

It is one of those diseases where there is a sliding scale of treatment , and some people need every type of treatment to help stop it spreading and coming back , others , like yourself and my mum, only need the minimum involvement- and like LL says, the hormone treatment can be and is,  extremely successful.  Have you looked at the Breast Cancer Care website ?

I ended up having lots of treatment , however after I went properly back to work about a year ago, I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what was wrong. We went away to stay with some friends (and I really didn\u2019t want to go ,very unlike me) and had a bit of a meltdown whilst on holiday. I couldn\u2019t explain properly , but there was somehow that I wanted recognition of having had cancer , I still to this day don\u2019t know what it is that I did want , my husband was lovely and when I had had my talk/rant whatever with him felt somehow a bit better. I don\u2019t think it is the Tamoxifen , I have now been onit for 18 months and only s/e I have had are hot flushes which have settled after being prescribed citalopram , however I had chemo and was thrown into a medical menopause so not even sure I can blame the Tamoxifen for that.  Have you thought about contacting your local cancer charity and seeing if you can have a chat with one of their staff ? I know several people who have been helped by this ? There is also a good article by Peter Harvey that if you search on the internet for you should find it , my BCN sent me a copy when all my treatment finished . Don\u2019t  be too worried about the Tamoxifen , most people are fine with it. jo x",

Most of it (but not all) fell out and I wore a wig until about 8 weeks after my treatment ended - I ended up going out without the wig on to fill the car up with petrol and then realising I had no head covering ..., but I just carried on as normal , nobody much looked at me and it was fantastically liberating and I ditched the wig straight away .Before my diagnosis I used to joke with my husband that if I ever ended up in a coma he needed to make sure my hair was dyed and looking lovely. Now my hair is growing back a lot , but is very grey but do you know what I am no longer bothered ! It will grow more and I will dye it again (probably more highlights) but I won't ever have it as long again. So I'm saying this really to try to make you feel better if you decide to ditch the cold cap - it is not the end of the world , losing my eyelashes and my nails was far worse and there's nothing I could have done about that .... It is important to do what you feel is right and not be swayed by others , however well meaning. You have breast cancer and that's a big deal , we all try and protect everyone else which is okay , but you also need to make sure that you look after yourself mentally and physically and only you know how to do that.  Very best wishes for the rest of your treatment , and hope you feel a bit better soon . jo xx",

All the horrible things which happen to us seem to go on endlessly , and one thing I have struggled with is all the decisions we have to make at every part of the journey , no one can tell you what you should do , and as everyone is so different what works for one doesn't work for another . What I would say is to not think about it just yet , get over your first chemo and just see how you feel as you get nearer to it.  I think for me I didn't want to be a victim and didn't want people to look at me and feel sorry for me , whilst I was having chemo the strictly come dancing stars came to visit - most people were happy to see them and had photos etc , I just wanted the floor to open up and swallow me, i didn't want their pity and the tilted head talking to ... that's my problem not theirs , they gave up their time and I'm sure a visit to a chemo ward was not top of their list if of things to do either ,  and most people were very buoyed up by it. So whilst no one can tell you what to do , and what works for one doesn't always work for another , just give yourself a bit of space to clearly think about it x With love jo x",

      "Content": "Hi Eni What are the results they have given you so far ? Im guessing you have been diagnosed as ER+ which is where the Tamoxifen will come from, and that you are having a lumpectomy and not a mastectomy at the moment ? Sometimes the result after the surgery comes back different (but not normally) my sister-in-law was expecting the same as you but her pathology came back as HER2+ so she will be having different treatment including chemotherapy. It is also not always possible for them to know whether the nodes are involved until they test them, so again that may mean a different scenario, hopefully you will be on a straightish path but things don't always go to plan with breast cancer, there are so many different types and treatments etc that are fine tuned to each person, but try not to worry too much at the moment, just take each step as you go along and concentrate on your surgery and recovering from that. Do you have a date for your surgery yet ? Jo x",

Some treatments can affect your heart , either the chemo or if her cancer is HER2+ the Herceptin given for this type can affect the heart and make you breathless ( i had this) so she will have heart scans to monitor if she has any problems (i had 5) but most of these side effects are temporary. If she is stage 3 it is very treatable and there are so many different treatments nowadays - no guarantees but there are many women on this site who were/are stage 3 and absolutely fine now.  Stage 4 is still often treatable for many years but isn\u2019t curable, my aunt is stage 4 and now 3 years since her diagnosis with spread to her bones and lungs and she is fine, so please don\u2019t panic too much !

I had a mastectomy with an immediate implant instead, I had the operation on the Thursday and came out of hospital on the Friday morning. I did have a couple of drains in which were removed after a few days (on the following Wednesday I think) I found the operation okay, I was lucky and had no pain, although everything was very itchy and finding something suitable to wear took a few days. I was out and about straight away, and just had to be careful with the drains. I went out for my birthday two weeks after the operation and was fine. I am seeing the surgeon next Monday to talk about having the DIEP flap procedure later on this year, so it is possible to have temporary surgery and then go back for more. Hope this helps Jo x",

Sometimes the lumpectomy doesn't get all the cancer so more operations are needed , or if your sister has a mastectomy whether she has an immediate reconstruction - not sure if they think there are lymph nodes involved , that is also a factor - there are so many unknowns with breast cancer ,not in the effectiveness of the treatment but in all the different treatments involved , but if your sisters feeling okay it would be great to go away - I had to cancel two holidays and even this year have been a bit uncertain with various things still going on but got away a couple of weeks ago and it was great (I'm nearly one year since diagnosis)  Well done for being a great sister too, it can be a lonely place at times having cancer and having someone to help is wonderful , I've been really lucky but know others aren't as lucky as me.

I would just caution for not planning on booking something as it's still early days , and she may be worth asking her oncologist about it - there are guidelines on how long surgery should be after chemo and vice-versa and unfortuately treatments often don't go to plan for lots of reasons, so mentioning that she is hoping to go away may allow them to build this into their plans ?  It's such a shame when family members struggle to understand the seriousness of a cancer diagnosis , and even with the fact that breast cancer is very treatable it is still a real slog with all the treatment. Perhaps you could encourage your sister to join in here ? There are lots of very helpful people who are a great source of advice, inspiration and common sense. Best wishes to you  Jo x",

I would have thought that if there is still evidence of active cancer cells when you have the pathology back you can ask about more chemo ? I have seen some women have extra chemo after, but unsure of the reasons for this ? I am sure someone who has been in your situation will be along shortly and who can offer you proper advice rather than hearsay that I am giving! Jo x",

My mum was diagnosed 12 years ago when she was 69 , similar diagnosis although she was very small busted, and there were no where near as many trials , treatments then. She decided to just opt for hormone therapy , she didn't want to go through chemo , and didn't want to run the risk of lympodema either from the auxiliary clearance , she felt that given her age she would enjoy her life with as little medical intervention as possible. She is now almost 81 and fighting fit. Has your mum been offered the oncotype test ? As she is ER+ and miniscule node involvement I would have thought she qualified?  Can you make an appointment with your mums breast care nurse and go with your mum to ask questions ? Get as many questions formulated from looking on this site and see what they say ?  Jo x",

My first chemo and Herceptin  was gruelling and I was in the chemo centre for 10 hours - after the Herceptin injection you have to be monitored for 6 hrs before they will give you the chemo part, and before the chemo part you also have steroids , anti-histamines and anti sickness intravenously. My regime is weekly (I was led to believe before seeing the oncologist it would be 4-6 courses every three weeks.  I have my treatment onThursdays, but go for blood tests on the Wednesday morning, except the Herceptin week when I see the consultant on the Tuesday - although I have felt pretty much okay , I really would have struggled time wise to go back to work , I couldn't go Friday as I feel weird , and I have also started to feel really tired - plus as my hair is coming out and I can't have it coloured it looks a complete mess but I don't feel comfortable wearing a wig just yet. I think before the chemo part although I had had three ops the difference to being referred to oncology made me realise the seriousness of the treatment and that was a big shock to me, it really is bizarre isn't it whennyou actually don't feel ill but suddenly everyone is talking about heart scans blood platelet counts etc   The Herceptin jab can sting (not like a normal  injection) and the chemo doesn't hurt , but I have found the whole experience so far to be much more tiring than I thought and I do feel very anxious from Tuesday onwards each week.  Hope this helps you ? Another little thing , I have a lovely friend who makes us some homemade soup for me to have when I get in from hospital on Thursday night and this is the best thing ever !  Best of luck with your treatment, and enjoy your festivities!  Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi there If you are triple negative you won't be offered Herceptin or Tamoxifen , these are for HER2+ and ER+ respectively , although I do believe some post-menopausal women are being offered the post-menopausal version , called AI inhibitors , for HER2+ breast cancer.  I am not sure how far you are at the moment with your diagnosis , but I am currently on Herceptin (waiting for the injection as we speak) after having 12 lots of chemotherapy, as I am HER2+. I am also ER+ so am also on Tamoxifen.  I know the thought of all these drugs is horrifying , but the reality tends not to be. I saw my oncologist yesterday and the Tamoxifen is doing its job and my oestrogen is almost zero. I do however have flushes and have not slept a full night for months due to hot sweats in bed, and hopefully will be taking something else soon to sort this out.  BUT I am still alive and I would rather be where I am than refusing treatment, but we all have a choice at the end of the day and you do not have to have the treatment they offer , some people don't and I completely respect that.  Dont be panicked by the thought of the treatments , just take one step at a time. best wishes Jo x",

I was diagnosed with an invasive lump in Aug 2017 , had WLE but no clear margins , 2nd op also uncovered extensive DCIS , still no clear margins, so third op - still no guarantee of clear margins so I ended up with a mastectomy. My breast looked fine through all the WLE's , so I wouldn't worry too much about how it looks, they do just remove small areas.  Mine is not the norm, most people have success after the 2nd op , and I have to say I was extremely upset after the 2nd failed op, but in the end just glad it was all removed. The pathology of my mastectomy showed no cancer , so in effect I was clear after the third one but they just didn't know that and I was glad to be rid of it - however if you can keep your breast I would. Hope your second op goes well and you get good news then Jo xx",

Please don't panic about the results , easy to say but I was diagnosed 11 months ago with a 1.8 cm tumour , grade 1 stage 1 which once I had surgery became 2.1 cm and grade 2 stage 2. They also uncovered extensive grade 3 DCIS which was about to become invasive, so I ended up having a mastectomy and implant reconstruction after my chemo.  if you just take one step at a time , the not knowing and waiting for results is the most nerve wracking part , and nothing anyone says will make that bit easier - but the treatment is all do able andI am so thankful now that I am still alive , when you have breast cancer you are not normally ill, so getting your head around the fact that you are going to have treatment which will make you feel worse in the short term is mind boggling , along with all the medical terminology and decisions we have to make fairly quickly.  This site is great for getting information , reassurance and seeing how other people go on with their breast cancer , so just post a discussion and someone will be along to answer your query , no matter how big or small it is.

Losing my hair was actually liberating , and I decided to keep it short and silver fox , but have realised that every time I look at myself I am reminded of the cancer and I now need to properly move on - my last Herceptin is due 8th November and (apart from the possibility of ovary removal and tablets) will be the end of treatment and  I am looking forward to it so much - not sure what to do with the hair yet , bizarrely losing it was okay , it's it growing back that's caused me more problems !  Hope you are soon back home and hope you are feeling a bit better.

I also had my dressing gown on and walked down to the theatre. I took off my dressing gown and laid on an operating bed , where I slipped my arms out but was still covered up, but meant it was easier for them to move during the operation . Then injection from the anaesthetist and next thing woke up in recovery.  It was all done completely sensitively, everyone was completely lovely, it is still an operation but please don't worry , these are usually done as day cases too. Where I had mine they also tested my lymph nodes whilst I was under , and if there was cancer in there would have removed all of them - luckily for me there was no spread to the lymphs so I didn't need this procedure.  If you have any queries or questions , don't worry about them just post them on here and someone will answer them.

However the earlier caught and the lower the grade gives a very good indication that recurrance is very, very low risk.  Your consultant should also be able to give you statistics , there does seem to be a movement away from these drugs by women who have debilitating side effects and would just rather take the risk and enjoy their lives.

They were really helpful in explaining things , she suggested before getting up in the morning bringing my arm across my body (as if it was broken and in a pot) and then lifting that over my head -  apparently this is a good one to do if you are going on to have radiotherapy as this is the position you may need to adopt whilst having it - not sure if you are having radiotherapy and I am not now but someone else may be able to advise ?  After three ops ( last one end of October) my boob has just settled down but I do still have some thickening at the top , so I think it can take some time for it all to heal properly.

When they operated they found lots of DCIS, but I was told they don't test for HER2+ in DCIS as it is not applicable, they do test for ER/PR though, so all my treatment (apart from surgery ) was guided on the invasive part.

Also if they will do anything with your remaining breast to even you up ? Also practicalities of the operation, how long will you be in, will you be fitted with a bra, will you have the drains changed by district nurses etc. these are all individual to the area you live. I had a mastectomy with immediate implant last year as I had already had three failed WLE's,  and just couldn't face a long operation - however I am waiting to be referred to the clinic to discuss having a diep flap, but due to cost cutting I may not be able to have it - another thing to factor in, that you may only get the one shot at it now ?

Some of my friends cooked for me and my family , bringing around lasagnes , curries , fish pies , cakes - you name it we've had it. This was a godsend when I had my operations and during my weekly chemo (one friend makes us homemade soup each week) I have had numerous flowers , gifts , lovely toiletries etc, so anything you can do for her would be so much appreciated. The one thing I have been most humbled by is the text messages and words of encouragement I get from some people , often those not closest to me. I know it is impossible to know what your friend is going through , but by being interested and letting her know you care in whatever way you think will, I'm sure be very much appreciated.

I had a mastectomy 2 years ago aged 51 and I was just in overnight - your mum may need to stay in longer as she is having a double. What she will have is drains which are huge, my district nurse came every day to monitor them until they were removed on day 6. I never needed any pain relief, but it can be very uncomfortable, plus having a general anaesthetic will take it\u2019s toll.  I would say two weeks should be okay, but it is difficult to say as everyone reacts so differently.As Ronstar says the exercises are really important, and it may be useful for your mum to do them before she goes into hospital to familiarise herself and also to see if she can actually do them - if you google breast cancer exercises you should find them ( there may also be some on the Macmillan site)  best wishes Jo x",

But I found the recovery to be fine and started going to the gym about 3 months after the operation (could have been sooner if I had wanted to), I think if you are pretty healthy and fit you will recover quicker, so the fact that you run will stand you in good stead. Even now I wear a really tight sports bra for the gym as I just feel more comfortable with it. Personal decision, I was all set for the DIEP (didn't want the back muscle op at all anyway) but realised I really didn't want another part of my body being cut open and also realised I was more interested in having the tummy tuck than the actual boob .... Whatever you decide they are not real, however realistic they look, and my implant looks fine, although a little perkier than my other one (although the surgeon said he is happy to lift that one to match if I want, don't think I am going to bother ) Good luck Jo x",

      "Content": "Hello I know many people who have had breast cancer over the years, and most of them have had no side-effects from the endocrine drugs, my mum was on Tamoxifen for 5 years some time ago (in her sixties at the time) as there were no AI's then, she had no problems at all with them. I am on Tamoxifen (on the edge of post-menopausal) and have the hot sweats and flushes but nothing else, however I don't see this as a side effect, this is what the drugs are supposed to do, suppress the oestrogen in the body., so I am just investigating various options to alleviate these symptoms. I am 52 and am having more blood tests soon to see if my brain is still trying to kick-start my ovaries, and if it is will be having them removed. I think women around the 50 age group who are probably peri-menopausal are most problematic with these drugs and oestrogen production. Like everything, you need to be aware of possible problems, but people often come on sites like this one when they are having problems, the ones who aren't don't tend to bother, so it may seem that everyone has problems with them when in fact the opposite may be true. Good luck in your choice, as someone else has said why not try it and see how it goes ? Or ask about Tamoxifen which my mum had, today she would be offered AI's instead ? Jo x",

What operation are you having ? Having a lumpectomy is normally only a day case and you are only under for a short period of time ,an hourish, a mastectomy is usually longer , depending on what reconstruction depends on your recovery etc. The sentinel nodes are also removed in whichever operation and checked for any traces of cancer.  Hope this helps jo x",

      "Content": "Hi lindsaybubbles Mine is a similar story to yours , I had a lumpectomy but no clear margins and two subsequent \u201ccavity chest shaves \u201c still no clear margins , they just kept on finding more of all sorts of stuff which hadn\u2019t shown up on any scans - my lymph nodes were clear , but I needed chemo as mine was HER2+ and needed the chemo to have Herceptin. After this finished I had my mastectomy with an immediate implant, which I was pleased with. The bittersweet news was that no trace of cancer was found in the remaining breast tissue , but to be honest I was glad to be rid of it at the time. I am now awaiting a plastic surgery appointment to have DIEP reconstruction. I was diagnosed exactly 2 years ago tomorrow so it is all a memory but I can still feel the disappointment when things didn\u2019t go to plan- I started a blog at the time entitled Snakes and ladders as that\u2019s how my journey feels it has been. Has  reconstruction been mentioned to you yet ? It is such a hard decision to make, and I think after failed lumpectomies even harder as you have already accepted that you don\u2019t need a mastectomy to then be told you do, with time ticking away too. Please message me if you want any more information and good luck with your treatment. Jo x",

If you are going somewhere in this country you may be okay , but flying abroad may mean you are exposed to too many germs ? If you already have insurance for your holiday you need to let them know about your diagnosis , but if not there is a travel insurance thread here on the Macmillan site - I went away after my treatment  and used Boots online. They were really good. If you\u2019ve not seen your oncologist yet, ask your nurse for their phone number and ring them - I rang mine a couple of times and they always got back to me  quickly.   In terms of does it hurt , as others have said it doesn\u2019t , if it does you need to tell them - but the chemo units are generally a quiet place, mine had tv on and you can chat or just be by yourself if you want. My mum came with me to most of mine and came packed up with sandwiches and snacks , the best description of it is really quite boring !  Good luck ,  Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi Tukis1983, So sorry you have been diagnosed with such a life changing disease at such a young age , I think it is so hard to get your head around to the fact that you probably didn't feel at all ill, but have been given this devastating news along with the whole hospital, appointments, surgery etc - and having surgery is a stark reminder of that as well , particularly, the major surgery you have had. I do think it is also a form of bereavement , mourning our past life - but we do have a life to look forward to as do our children , and that's what I always try and think. I am normally very positive but it hits me at times when things haven't gone to plan or the silliest things - that is completely normal and I think the despair is also from the fact that although we have (without wanting to!) changed our loved ones lives with the diagnosis , we are out of control with being able to fix it , and I think mum's always want to fix things for the better for our children.  My main thought is that I can't change what has happened, the only thing I can really control is how I deal with it , and everyone will have different ways of this. In a couple of days , once you have recovered a bit more from the surgery , you will hopefully regain a bit of perspective again - if you still feel very low you may be better talking to your Dr ?  Much love Jo x",

My friend has secondary breast cancer but has not applied for it as she is still okay. If everyone who has cancer (breast cancer is not special) applied the system would collapse, so only those who really need it should apply, otherwise they will be lost in a system of cases which are not valid.

I had a mastectomy and asked about the other one, but even though my mum and aunt have both had breast cancer the answer was there was no need.  Having a mastectomy doesn\u2019t stop it coming back either I\u2019m afraid , there is very little difference between recurrence rates from lumpectomy and mastectomy. Have you asked about counselling ? Your local cancer charity will offer this service, and your breast care nurse will also be able to refer you if needed. I think it is such a shock, and you have had such a whirlwind treatment you probably haven\u2019t had time to properly get your head around the whole situation.  Jo xx",

      "Content": "HiRoundhouse1 I had weekly Paclitaxol, as Leolady said hair loss was, for me after week 3, other side effects were my nails took a battering, fell off months later, became infected etc, this bothered me more than losing my hair. I also had several bleeds of my nose, just dripping with blood, particularly if I had anything hot or spicy. I also developed blisters of hard skin all over my hands - as you can imagine my hands looked delightful! I then developed weird brown patches on my palms too, but they were short lived. Your mum will be given steroids and anti-histamines as the drug can have a very strong reaction if you are allergic, these affected me more than the actual drug. I had a couple of episodes of choking after my treatment ( the same night) but that was when I had eaten something not suitable such as fish and chips. I just ended up having homemade soup and bread on throes treatment nights. One bizarre thing was that I have suffered from a form of dermatitis for years and it cleared up whilst I was on the chemo, and although it has now returned it is much less severe. I have never suffered with any issues from the Herceptin, but we are all different and can all react in different ways. I found it quite gruelling at the time, but doable. It is two years next week when I started my treatment and am now happy, hopefully healthy and enjoying life, your mum will get there too, particularly with support from family and friends, I was really lucky in that and am sure it made a difference. hope this helps jo x",

I had two further operations, and still no clear margins although on the last one she was 50/50 whether she had got it all. My invasive lump was HER2+ so I was always going to have chemo, but after my chemo finished I had a mastectomy and immediate implant reconstruction. When the analysis was done of my breast tissue there was no cancer or DCIS in it - did they get clear margins before or was it the chemo/herceptin ? I will never know. I think they do look at more than the actual margins, but if you are concerned I would ask for a second opinion, or at least voice my concerns to my breast care nurse ? Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi eliza44 Ive just had a look and it seems that it is not a recommended scan to determine breast cancer , and it doesn\u2019t seem to be widely used. In terms of the oncotype, the general test is for invasive cancer to determine whether chemotherapy would be useful to stop a recurrence - as DCIS is not invasive it isn\u2019t suitable. There does seem to be some kind of oncotype for DCIS but only where there has been a lumpectomy and it is not covered by NICE as a normal test. i had a similar story to you but my initial lump was invasive, however my breast was pretty much filled with high grade rupturing DCIS which hadn\u2019t shown up on anything. I had my mastectomy two year ago and have now had two clear mammograms on my other breast. Am I confident there is nothing there ? Not completely but I am just ultra vigilant, there is nothing which will give any full peace of mind unfortunately, only that it is possible but it is generally unlikely to have breast cancer in both breasts. Worry about recurrence is something which we all have to live with, I just don\u2019t let it get in the way of living, I can\u2019t change what may or may not happen, however there are some very good counselling services available and you may get some help there ? Also breast cancer care have a Someone like me service and they may be able to put you in touch with one of their volunteers who has had a similar scenario to you. Hope this helps Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi Lelotron I have had both operations , a failed WLE and subsequent cavity chest shaves to get clear margins, followed by a mastectomy when still no clear margins after the two cavity chest shaves . After the first three operations , once things settled down no one would have known that I had had any operations, my surgeon cut around the nipple. I also had a fully working nipple. I had to have chemo as I had an invasive HER2+ lump as well as extensive rupturing DCIS (this, like yours wasn't shown on any scans) and after my chemo had a mastectomy with an immediate implant, including removal of my nipple. The subsequent pathology revealed no cancer or DCIS left.  I was desperate to be rid of my breast and also concerned about the other breast , but they are reluctant to do the double operation or even the single sometimes. I couldn't understand that at all , but now I can. I have a permanent reminder that I had cancer ,I can't help but think about it everyday when I see my breast, and do mourn having a real breast, even though costmetically no one would know when I am wearing clothes. So , other things to bear in mind , if you have a mastectomy they can't scan you as there isn't enough breast tissue left , but you can still get a recurrance as there is always some tissue left ( and research shows that having a mastectomy doesn't give any better outcome in terms of survival)  At the beginning of the process and before I had breast cancer I would have alsways said I would want the breast removed , and I know it was the right decision for me (I couldn't have ever rested knowing there may be cancer left)  but it is a very major thing , so you really need to think carefully about it.  Hope this perspective helps you , Jo xx  ",

You will be assessed for your heart as Herceptin can affect some aspects of the function,  Was it a fun 15 months ? No , although the chemo ward was visited by the strictly come dancing stars and watching Ed balls do the Macarena with the Ward sister will never be erased from my memory ...  I am now two years since diagnosis and life is back to normalish, as a family we have had many, many challenges these last two years including my husband being diagnosed with prostate cancer the month after me, however our mantra is that we are lucky,  to have a fantastic health system to help us deal with everything , and to be able to carry on living a wonderful life which is denied to so many who are not as fortunate.  My oncologist said it was like thinking of giving up a year to have twenty and that\u2019s how I have thought if it , however only you know what impact on your own life this will have - have you rung up the helpline on breastcancercare ?

If there were an easy cure involving plants etc it would have been discovered many many years ago. Modern research is not all funded by drug companies , there is extensive research going on the whole world over by academics, funded by many different sources - and these academics and Drs talk to each other , they don't just read up on something - for them the publication of a paper will be generally something they are already aware of and following - it doesn't just appear from nowhere. I think we all have a responsibility to take some control of our own treatments and question the particular treatment (as we know , pretty much no-one has the same scenario and treatment) we are being offered , I have always known that cancer doesn't just recur , how can it if it's been removed , but the treatment nowadays is to attack as much of the rogue cells as possible or cut off the sources (university of Sheffield is leading a research on LOX cells sent out by breast cancer) with targeted treatments leading the way such as Herceptin- no one has ever said that I will be cured , treatable and hopefully no recurrence , but as I said earlier , there is no cure , just treatment which hopefully works for us , and that is enough to let us lead a long and fulfilled life.  Everyone has to make their own choices, and life is all about having choices - we are lucky in the western world to have choices and access to first rate care , some people don't have that luxury.

The waiting is the worst time, and it may be that even when you go to the clinic they can\u2019t always give you any news there and then, but may take some biopsies and you will need to wait for the results again.  Just remember though that this forum is made up of women who are in the minority who get a breast cancer diagnosis after the tests, so don\u2019t think that this will definitely be you ,  it\u2019s just that a breast cancer forum is obviously biased towards breast cancer !  Hopefully you will get good news, but if you do get a breast cancer diagnosis, it is a very treatable disease nowadays and there are some outstanding drugs and other treatments which effectively \u201ccure\u201d most women - it\u2019s not a pleasant journey, but doable, so just try and take a deep breath. Someone gave me good advice on here a long time ago, and that was to allow yourself time every day, whether that\u2019s ten minute morning and night, or half an hour in the middle of the day, whatever you decide, and just try and spend that time thinking of what is happening to you, don\u2019t spend any other time thinking about it.

I might be missing something but reading your earlier messages you wanted to look at alternatives to the conventional route , I am wondering which ones have you tried ?  It looks like you are having various conventional drugs now but have not had the surgery to remove the lump ? Would you at some point now have the surgery to stop you having to take these drugs ? Could you also let me know what alternatives you looked at and (because as I said I might have missed than) whether anything worked for a while or why you discounted them ?  Good luck with your next blood tests Jo x",

Just tablets now for the next 9 years, and have hopefully seen the last of the chemo unit at my cancer hospital. It has been a rocky road at times and I know there are no guarantees ahead, but I feel ready for a new chapter in my life, just not sure what it is yet .... thank you to all you lovely folk who have helped me along the way, even when you didn't know you had, and hopefully I have been able to help others in some small way too. For those of you just diagnosed, there is light at the end of the tunnel, even though the tunnel may become twisty and dark and seem like you can't see the end of it at times, you will get there!

However I ended up with an infection in my nailbeds, (it was beyond gross) but my GP prescribed some antibiotics which cleared it up, so do watch out for that (they squeeked and smelt, look out for this) I did also lose toenails 6 months after my treatment ended, and 18 months later some of my nails are still weird. I found simple things like loading the washer really made my nails sore and I ended up wearing latex gloves when I had the infection. Once they come off it was not at all painful, just a bit weird, and the new nails grew back reasonably quickly. I do feel your pain, this bothered me more than losing my hair ... Jo x",

The medical staff work to try and make sure that this happens for us all, and sometimes that means that plans change, it doesn't mean that you are in a worse place, just that your treatment may need to change. No-one want to have chemo, for many, many reasons, but if the score comes back that it will give you a more favourable result, it will be worth it, if you don't need it you will just have been set back a couple of weeks. Fingers crossed for you. Jo x",

Before the op I was told the tumour  was grade1 and both oestrogen and HER2+. On going back yesterday the grade had been changed to 2 and there were insufficient margins so I have to go back in next week for more surgery.Gutted. But the histology also now says Her2- so they are re-testing the tumour. It is all so up and down , and it feels like the last two (three by the time I have my second op) have been a waste of very precious time.  I wondered if I could classify myself as cancer free after the op but I think the answer has to be no as it is like a game of snakes and ladders with no- one knowing when you will land on either a snake or a ladder !  Good luck in your recovery, and hopefully many more ladders! ",

She is now in her 80's and said if she had been offered an implant (which is what I have) she would have gone for that, mainly I think as she could just forget about it. Her dog chewed the prosthesis twice, so beware if you have animals ! For me, I had a similar situation to you, three failed ops and then a mastectomy - I needed chemo inbetween and was due to have a DEIP flap but had had enough of all the treatment by then, so opted for an implant.  Mine has gone a bit weird, it is rippled as it is over the pectoral muscle, and a smaller size to my other one, and am now waiting for a DIEP to be done some time next year. I am 20 years younger than yourself and so I do think age comes into it. The recovery from the implant was fine, I was only in hospital overnight, mainly due to my heart doing weird things, and was back at work full-time after 6 weks. Hope this helps your decision. Jo x",

It turned  out to have been a typing mistake so I was Her2+ - so if you feel uneasy I would query your result?  If it's correct , I have seen a few posts from women with small lumps who have not had chemo for TN , may be worth looking in the triple negative group ?

I called in at work several times for a coffee and chat and asked them to keep me in the loop whilst I was off, they have been fantastic but I know I have missed out on several opportunities , but knowing I had their support was one less thing to worry about. I think if I had been off and not been in touch i would have felt quite anxious about going back to work ... I did think they may find out that I don't do much ,but luckily they filled my desk with flowers , cards and welcome back posters !  Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi I had the same as your mum, she will be given a heart scan before the treatment starts and during the treatment as it can affect the heart-I had no problems with mine. My hospital they are reluctant to use the coldcap for HER2+ BC, but I had already decided I wouldn\u2019t go with it anyway. My biggest problem was my nose bleeding and my nails were horrific, this bothered me more than losing my hair. She really needs to look after her nails and as Leolady56 has suggested, the October chemo thread will offer tips and tricks to try and keep them as good as possible.  Everyone is very different though to how they react, so my tip is to do exactly as the oncology nurses tell her, any illness with a temperature or sore throat etc needs looking at by a Dr. I had an appointment with the oncologist whilst on chemo and she mentioned my voice was a bit croaky, I actually felt okay, but she checked my throat, said it was inflamed and gave me double strength antibiotics. So make sure she is just aware of her body and if something doesn\u2019t feel right, contact a dr. It is almost two years now since I started, November 10th, and it is all doable, not always loads of fun (!) but doable. I did get to meet the strictly come dancing stars that year who came to visit, and Ed Balls doing the Macarena with the sister in the chemo suite was a very surreal moment..... Good luck to your mum, and to you for being a lovely daughter, I was extremely lucky to have fab family and friends who rallied around, I know a lot of people aren\u2019t that lucky and struggle on their own.

After my chemo I started on Tamoxifen too for the ER+ part and go back in a couple of weeks to see if my ovaries will need removing.  I am just over a year since diagnosis and near the end of most treatment now , it is all doable , not always pleasant , but doable!  Ps my sister in law had the same type and had her five year all clear last week too.  Good luck Jo x",

I too have a family history of heart disease ( my dad died from a heart attack aged 65 and my mum also suffered a heart attack aged 67, her father died aged 65 from a heart attack too) and was concerned about the Herceptin, but my reading was 69 % when I started which is very good and my last muga scan (after 11 Herceptin) was showing 68% so no real problem with my heart, I also took part in a trial which involved a MRI of my heart, and all was good, so I wouldn't worry about this, they will monitor you. In terms of the chemo, I had weekly Paclitaxel (for twelve weeks every week) as my oncologist said I only needed the chemo in order to have the Herceptin. It is still chemo but the weekly one is a smaller dose each time. I was never sick or felt particularly sick, the steroids and anti-histamines they give you before the chemo caused me more problems! The chemo itself meant I lost my hair, my nose bled, I developed blisters on my hands and my fingers and toes became very sensitive. I developed an infection in my nails and nearly lost them all, I lost some toenails (including the big one five months after chemo) I wasn't aware of these side effects before, I was just indoctrinated to worry about the sickness which never materialised .... I am not sure about the fasting, you really need to see how you feel anyway and your tastebuds can go very weird! I was diagnosed just over a year ago and still having Herceptin (had no 15 last week) and am on Tamoxifen as am also ER+, but I can now see light at the end of the tunnel, my hair is growing back really well and my nails have fully recovered. Mentally I am not sure I am the same person (I know I'm not actually) but like to think I am a better version of the old me! Good luck with your next appointment, Jo x",

I saw a consultants registrar in the breast clinic , and was the referred to a surgeon , following surgery I met my oncologist - who I have seen only 3 times but registrars about 6 times ? Do you have a breast care nurse ? They should be able to help. i do think that unfortunately until they start on various treatments and biopsies they don't always know the full extent if your cancer - mine was small, easily treatable , lumpectomy , tablets radiotherapy and all done but didn't work out that way , ended up with 4 surgeries the last one being a mastectomy as every operation they uncovered more cancer. I know now 11 months down the line that it is just one of those things (not saying yours is) but  breast cancer malarkey is anything but smooth. Others have given some starting points for taking this forward, do you take anyone with you to your appointments ? best wishes jo x",

      "Content": "Hi Yes they do, it means you will be seen within two weeks so no waiting around - your GP won't know what it is but if you fit the criteria there are guidelines, one being that you are seen within two weeks, if BC is a possibility. This doesn't mean it is what you have, most referrals don't end up in a breast cancer diagnosis (90% not breast cancer i believe) there are many other things it can be. It may appear from this site that everyone referred has a breast cancer diagnosis but it is just because we are the unlucky ones who have ! Hopefully you won't have breast cancer, but if you do it is generally very treatable nowadays, and there are fantastic treatments available - it won't stop you being worried or concerned particularly as you will probably have to wait for biopsy results too. I am guessing RDE is just a term used by dr's, it won't be anything to do with what your GP thinks it is. Good luck, the waiting is horrible so just try and not think about it too much ... Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi It would make sense that if you have DCIS 2 is the grade, as the \"stage\" for DCIS is 0,  it hasn't yet become invasive. It may also be that the area is larger than expected, which is why the mastectomy was suggested. BUT if when you were operated on they also discovered an invasive lump, this may have muddied the waters, so you do really need to know whether you have DCIS (pre-cancerous) or an invasive lump (cancerous) or both as there are different treatments after surgery depending on the type you have. Just for some context, i was initially told it was stage 1 grade 1, but when operated on this changed to stage 2 (lump bigger, just,  2cm) and grade 2, as the cells were more liable to reproduce than grade 1. They also uncovered a whole area of DCIS which didn't show up on any scans. My lump was ER+ and HER2+ so chemo, Herceptin and hormone tablets (no spread to any lymphs so not the full chem) The DCIS they only test for ER/PR+ as they do not give chemo for DCIS, so if I had just had the DCIS it would have been mastectomy and hormone treatmen, no chemo or radiotherapy. Your GP should have a copy of the pathology, so it may also be worth going to see them ? Hope this helps Jo x",

I had to reduce the dose to come off them , one tablet every other day, and by chance spoke to a work colleague who had had them for anxiety and thought the dose was too high. I contacted my GP and am now continuing with a 20mg tablet every other day and am so happy that my life is starting to get back to normal.

      "Content": "Hello I have been on Tamoxifen for 18 months now, my periods stopped when I started chemo and haven't restarted, but the chemo sent me into a chemical menopause, so I started with hot flushes during this time (at least being bald made for having a cool head!) I have had several different brands, and can't say I have noticed any difference between any of them. The hot flushes became worse after about 4-5 months on Tamoxifen, but this is due to them blocking the oestrogen, which is what they are supposed to do, so isn't a side effect but evidence of them working .... I tried acupuncture, and evening primrose oil, and eventually I acted on my oncologists recommendation of low dose citalopram. These have most definately helped the flushes, apparently they block the sensors which make you flush. I do however still find myself with sweat rolling down my face and body if I have over-exerted myself and it is hot, but I can cope with this, just the flushes which really affected me.  I have always had problems with my tendons, and my achilles and leg tendons are now quite stiff and I think this maybe the Tamoxifen, but I can get by with these problems. My mum had Tamoxifen a number of years ago and never had any issues at all, I think most ladies do, but when you feel like the side effects are affecting your life you are best seeking some help.

I felt like you that  these things happen to other people , but the statistics are that one on every two of us we will get it at some part of our lives. However more people survive than don\u2019t (by a large number) because treatment is so good.  You may feel like this could be the best part , but in reality you are still in shock and are thrown into a world which you don\u2019t know anything about but which is serious and needs so much time. What I would say is that these early days are the worst, waiting for treatment plans and scans and results- once your mum is on the treatment conveyor belt you will feel easier.  As someone else has said your mum won\u2019t want you worrying too much, although she will know that you are, it is very important that you look after yourself for you , your family and your mum. If you search out the telephone number for breast cancer care , they have telephone helplines and I have heard very good reports of their online counselling, give them a call and they may be able to help you get your thoughts in order. Another  tip is just to allow yourself certain parts of the day to think about it , so if you find yourself worrying , and have some questions etc, just write them down and then when you get to the time you have allotted yourself you can think about them then, then when your 5 minutes etc are up, stop and carry on with something else. come on here at any time and someone will answer you and try to help. jo x",

I think like JoJo says you really need to contact the company yourself , I wasn't covered at all and had to take out my own insurance. I got a policy with Boots online which was so easy to use , including drop down boxes for the chemo and Herceptin etc, and I was covered for any issues with breast cancer (I was six months post chemo , 3 months post mastectomy and reconstruction, and having Herceptin and taking Tamoxifen) I was just 52 and no other health issues and the cost was £23 for a holiday to Spain. You are covered by your EHIC for European destinations for re-existing conditions if you become ill, but obviously not for cancellation and re-patriotism if needed. I think there is now a Group of its own on Macmillan just devoted to travel insurance so someone may be able to give you more details on specific credit card companies Jo x",

I almost fainted in shock and said there was no way I could be off all that time (I was HER2+ so knew I needed chemo) Unfortunately for me the WLE uncovered large areas of DCIS which didn't show up on any scans , and I had a two further cavity chest shaves , with no clear margins in the end. My first op was on 2nd September and I went back for two weeks at the end of October before my chemo started - LondonLass is completely right , I felt so guilty about work and went straight back after my chemo ended , too soon with hindsight.  You will be going through a huge amount of stress both physically and emotionally in the next few months , and plans can change at any time - give yourself a bit of slack, work will still be there xx",

      "Content": "Hi Please try not to worry , finding DCIS when it is still that is the best prognosis there is , the surgery and treatment is to prevent it becoming stage 1 , or cancerous.  DCIS in itself can't spread , so with your diagnosis now the removal of the DCIS will be the cure and then other treatments offered after to help stop a recurrance. There are suggestions that DCIS is overtreated , but at the moment there is no way of determining which cells would become cancerous and which wouldn't.  It is very hard to get a balanced view when you are just diagnosed as everything is so new , I felt like I was learning a new language, and sometimes things don't go quite to plan ( mine and ncluded) but most people have a straightforward diagnosis and treatment, and even if things don't go to plan there is always a plan B, C D etc.  Just try to concentrate on recovering from the surgery and what your particular hospitals procedure is, when you have had the op it is important to do the exercises they give you , so may be worth looking up what they are and getting into the swing of them before your op ?  I was diagnosed August 2016 and am due to finish my active treatment today , with just hormone tablets for 10 years to continue and life does return to normal again, just get through these next few weeks and you will be much calmer.  Best wishes  Jo x",

I just couldn't cope with the thought of that - I had been through 3 previous lots of surgeries and chemo and that definitely had a bearing on my decision. I had an immediate reconstruction with a permanent implant, the possible problems from this were more attractive than the ones from the DIEP, although my surgeon did say I could have the DIEP at a later date if I wished, but I don't think I will, I have had enough of hospitals for now. I think unless something does go wrong most people are happy with whatever their decision is,  and I am happy with mine - it is such a difficult decision as whatever the surgery, they are all fake breasts, it is just the extent of the fakeness ! I am sure you will get a few ladies who will give you their own surgery decisions, and good luck with your decision. Jo x",

I didn't need any other chemo apart from weekly Paclitaxel , which can only be given if there is no lymph nodes affected , so you may be offered that along with other chemo drugs for the invasive element being grade 3 ? I am currently on Tamoxifen but at 52 am borderline and may need my ovaries removing late this year. There is also a new drug which has not yet been given clearance by NICE called neratinib, which has very good results for HER2+ cancer , particularly where the cancer is also ER+ and has been authorised in the US - it is a follow up drug to Herceptin, so maybe by the time you have finished your year of Herceptin it will be available ? There are new treatments all the time, and although you get the double whammy of possible side effects being double positive  , you also get treatment targeted for both types of the cancer, which has to be a good thing.

Do you have a breast cancer nurse ? If so, contact her and arrange to see her, find the oncologists telephone number and call their secretary to see if you can get an earlier appointment. I noticed someone has put the details of how to contact the Macmillan helpline - but also look at contacting breascancercare.org, they have a helpline and are just dedicated to breast cancer. The other option may be to contact a local cancer charity and speak to them - if you havent used one they are truly fantastic places. Do you have someone close you can talk to or who could help you find out local information ? Whereabouts are you ? You are still in shock from this traumatic diagnosis, unfortunatley no one will be able to tell you completely everthing will be okay, not because of your diagnosis (it is the same for everyone) but if you get a bit of control back and feel like you are doing something positive to help yourself you may feel a bit more calm.

The three things are tumour size (T), node involvement (N) and metastatic status (M) DCIS is stage 0 as this is not a tumour , will have no node involvement (and the M status only applies to stage 4), A small tumour is classed as below 2cm, and with no node involvement will be classed as stage 1 etc. Until after the tumour has been removed it is just a very educated guess, mine was stage 1 but after removal changed to stage 2, grade 2 ,but they also found DCIS , grade 3 which didn't show up on any scans.  Please don't get too hung up on all this , everything before stage 4 is classed as \"curable\" no matter what your grade or stage there is a treatment for you - it just gives the specialists an idea of the treatment plan you should have. The actual pathology of the cancer gives many more different markers that relate to treatment. Everyone will have a slightly different cancer and treatment plan , try not to think too much about why one person has this and not that etc , that is for the oncologists and surgeons to decide.  It is like learning a new language, and is also hard to take everything on board at times , I was diagnosed a year ago and likened it to snakes and ladders, and a year on that is exactly how it has been.  Jo x",

My friends daughter was very upset when her dad developed bowel cancer and stopped going to school, she was 14/15 at the time. She got a lot of help and support from our local charity, so it may be worth asking if they can offer some advice ? There is also a list of resources on Cancer Research Uk here which may offer some help, and as GrannyLara says the Macmilllan helpline may be able to offer some help. It is a really rubbish time, my sons were 17, 18 and 20  when I was diagnosed and my husband was diagnosed the month after with prostate cancer - it felt like we were ripping their lives apart, and my middle son has gone off the rails (but I think he would have anyway) so I understand the guilt part completely. All I can say is that we just tried to laugh about some of the funnier moments, and we carried on at home as normal, I have always presented a positive outlook, they don't need my worries as well as their own.

      "Content": "Hi there  I believe nuclear grade is like a Grade 3 in full blown cancer, fast growing - I'm having the mastectomy due to the DCIS , the invasive cancer was gone after the second operation , my DCIS wasn't visible on the mammogram or ultrasound and only discovered during my second operation - if the margins had been clear it may be that they would have missed the DCIS ? Who knows ?  My diagnosis went from small grade 1 lump, easily treatable and \"just\" lumpectomy and radiotherapy and  probably tamoxifen to now - grade 2, invasive is ER+ and HER2+ , extensive DCIS , three operations (plus more to come) 12 weekly chemo sessions and 18 herceptin injections every 3 weeks, tamoxifen for 10 years etc etc  So I know exactly what you mean, I am several months and lots of consultations down the line , but it is all bewildering at times.  When do you need to make your decision ?

I have occasionally thought that myself , but it is always a fleeting thought and I can happily live my life, even with the permanent reminders of short hair, weird boob and side effects of Tamoxifen ... I think about cancer on a regular basis , but I can't change what will happen , so I am lucky to be able to just let cancer invade my day to day life momentarily. I wish I had the key to unlock whatever is causing you so much angst.  Tomorrow is another day and hopefully will be a good one for you. Much love Jo xx",

      "Content": "Hi Charlene I have been on Tamoxifen for over a year now - I have had the same brand, RelonChem, since I started. Unfortunately I had chemotherapy so started with menopausal symptoms then, so I can't actually say whether the hot flushes and sweats are from the Tamoxifen or if I would have had them anyway.  My oncologist did a blood test last summer and said they were working well and there was nothing more than a trace of oestrogen in my body - the benefit for me is actually quite minimal, but I would rather take them than not. I have now started taking a mild anti-depressant, citraloprom which should ease the flushes, but I haven't had it long enough yet for them to be working properly. I think you should give them a go, the only person I know who refused the tablets got a recurrance last year and is gutted that she may have been able to stop it by taking the Tamoxifen. Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi Moonbeam24 Just to add my experience to this .... I had a lumpectomy with no clear margins, due to extensive DCIS which was amongst the cancer. It hadn\u2019t shown up on anything so the surgeon had to do the re-excision \u201cblind\u201d , still no clear margins so had a third op. Not enough clear margins for that op so had a mastectomy with an immediate implant. What I would say is that your own breast is far superior to any reconstruction,  I have a reminder of the whole process, and almost three years since diagnosis would like to be able to properly move on, except every time I see myself in the mirror I see nonnipple and a very odd \u201cbreast\u201d Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am perfectly fine 99% of the time, just those few times when I see myself.  I didn\u2019t need radiotherapy as I had had a mastectomy, so that is a factor to consider that you may be in the same position - but deciding on reconstruction is very hard, however many women choose to stay flat , as did my mum, so you really have to weigh up the pros and cons for you. just as an aside when I had the pathology results of the mastectomy there was no trace of cancer or DCIS, so the last op had worked ..... Try and read up as much as you can on reconstruction and if possible speak to your BCN so that you have the best information for your decision. best of luck Jo",

      "Content": "Hi It is such a horrible worrying time, but GP\u2019s can\u2019t diagnose breast cancer. What they can do is look at the evidence and if they feel there is a possibility there are strict guidelines to follow. I was referred to the fast track although my GP felt it wasn\u2019t cancer, saw the GP Thursday and was at the breast clinic Monday morning. The consultant had a look and didn\u2019t think it was too suspicious, but mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy done she then told me it was definitely breast cancer and that I would be coming back for a treatment plan. So even the consultants don\u2019t know from just feeling a lump - 8 out 10 people who are referred don\u2019t have breast cancer, but even if it is there are many thousands of women who had had treatment and are still here to tell the tale, it isn\u2019t the death sentence it once was and there are some fantastic treatments available nowadays. I know you will be unbelievably anxious, and nothing anyone says will take that away until you have been - but often if biopsies are done there is another wait for results ( mine was unusual to be told there and then) and the waiting goes on... Hopefully you will be on this site for a very short time, but just take one step at a time and try and relax, my feeling was that if it is cancer then I have done the right thing being referred and I can\u2019t change what the result may or may not be, so just tried to carry on as normal. Good luck Jo xx",
