    "Content": "Hi, I was in a similar position and had oncotype dx testing which was pretty expensive but gave a definitive decision on chemo for me. I was 2 percent into the must have, which reduced my risk from 20 to 12 percent bit of a no brainer think your post said you were over by 1percent , the way I look at it they have a cut off for a reason, if you are not happy you are entitled to a second opinion. It's a big decision and one I didn't. Want to rush into, second chemo on Monday which to be honest if I could have avoided It I would. I am sure you will make the decision that is best for you x Good luck.",
