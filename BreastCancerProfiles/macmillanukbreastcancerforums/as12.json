It did get really big and even started pressing on my heart but it was monitored and 15 months after surgery I had an ultrasound which showed that it was extensive.  By this time it had obviously moved slightly as it was no longer giving me any heart problems. I did resort to wearing my 'softie' for a few weeks then it gradually reabsorbed over only a few days and now is no problem and I am not aware of any issue.  I went for my followup 18 months post surgery and the surgeon told me that it was almost imperceptible and I have had no problems since. Nasty while it lasted but able to put it behind me now.  Hope you have the same experience.",

      "Content": "banjoman Hi Little boo boo I wondered if you could answer a question for me. When you had the pain in your right breast, was it constant or did it come and go and how often? I only ask as I was at the docs again this week and she seemed quite happy with my pain. It has settled a little and is not present constantly but I just wondering if that makes any difference, or not. Many thanks for readingbreas this. Confused and not sure whether to now put it all behind me and move on .... Banjoman Hi sorry to hear of your problem. I originally had a lump that was painful when it was prodded but only over that area.  It wasn't the fact that it was painful that concerned the doctor but the lump itself. I was referred to the breast clinic and had a mammogram which confirmed the lump, an ultrasound and then a biopsy to confirm that it was indeed cancer. I had a mastectomy and chemotherapy. When I went for a followup a year after I had finished treatment I was having intermittent pain in my left breast (I had a right mastectomy) and the surgeon just felt around and said he was not concerned and gave me a leaflet about breast pain. I found it very helpful and it certainly reassured me. If you can get hold of a copy of that booklet from Macmillan I think you would find it helpful.  If you are still worried it would be worth discussing it further with your GP or practice nurse for further advice,  It is apparently very common, Hope this helps and you can move on.",

      "Content": "banjoman Hello there and thank you for your reply. Yes I had mammograms on both breasts and an ultra sound scan on the area of the indentation. The pain/discomfort is pretty random but in the same breast and aching sometimes too. Also niggling pain in the same shoulder blade and having been told many years ago that gallstones was the cause, did wonder if the current breast discomfort could be referred pain? I am so sorry your pain proved positive and hope you are okay now. I wondered, did you get a lump or anything with it or just pain and how if it was just the pain, how did they diagnose it? Many thanks again for writing and I would really appreciate anything you could tell me about your experience as I am so worried they may have missed something. Bassplayer I had a painful lump which was why I went to the GP. He sent me to the clinic where I had a mammogram and an ultrasound scan and biopsy. The doctor actually showed me the lump (which did turn out to be cancer) on my mammogram and even showed me what my last normal scan looked like to compare. I am now over a year since finishing my treatment and went for a mammogram last December on my 'good' side. Went for follow up last month and told the surgeon that I was getting pain but no lumps he examined me very thoroughly and told me there was nothing to worry about and gave me a leaflet about breast pain which was very informative. (it comes from Macmillan so you could download it). He just said that if I do get a lump with or without pain I should go back to my GP for a fast track re referral. Hope you can find relief and suitable pain killers if necessary. I find a firmish, non underwired bra helps. I got myself measured at a specialist lingerie shop (not a Department Store). The leaflet and the doctor both said that breast pain with no other symptoms is rarely if ever cancer.",

      "Content": "mistymoley as12 have you had your B12 checked? It could be a good idea and you really need it to be around the 800-1000 mark.  You need methylcobalamin, not cyanocobalamin, and a sublingual form is more easily absorbed. I take Jarrows 5000 iu, you can't overdose, any excess is excreted.  If your MCHC levels are also high, you could have pernicious anaemia, so it would be a good idea to get a full blood test. I always suggest people get a print out of the results for their own records, and learn what they mean.  Good luck  I have had a full blood count and B12 checked. My haemoglobin was 12.3 which is a bit lower than I would like (it was 13.2 before I started chemo in January 2016) My B12 was 400. The surgery were not concerned about either but I have just started Swanson sublingual B12 with folic acid, B6 and a B vitamin complex so it will be interesting to see whether there will be  any improvement. I didn't get a print out but it might be worth asking so that I can compare. Thanks for replying.",

I struggle to get moving with the pain in my feet and st night my legs and feet burn and drive me nuts. My hands are also getting worse. I am told this is not Herceptin but as I am now 3 months after the carboplatin and doxetaxol why is this getting worse?? It's awful. I also feel knackered and dizzy after the Herceptin which is worse each time? Can't imagine how much worse this is going to get if I have another 10 Herceptin!! The team seem to dismiss this. I am back at work part time and struggling. Still have to have rads in a few weeks. So sorry to moan!  Hugs and lovFe. Xxxx I only had surgery and FEC-T but started the neuropathy about a year after I had my last treatment.  I contacted the oncology department. My GP did a blood test to exclude all the obvious non chemo related causes and then the oncologist wrote to my GP suggesting he try a course of Vitamin B6. Also suggested a course of Amytriptillin or Gabapentin.  I opted for the latter because my previous experience with amytriptillin sent me to sleep for about 12 hours. I was taking a Vitamin B supplement anyway so I have added extra vitamin B6 and also B12 because I also get some numbness. The Gabapentin really helps. I am only on 300mg 3 times a day which I had to build up to gradually but although it doesn't eliminate it completely makes it bearable. I could take more but don't really want to if I can avoid it. I too have been told that it usually goes after about 18 months to 2 years. Hope this helps.",

I have shifted to tights (actually pop socks with the toe cut off). So comfortable and less obtrusive, although I find I don't care about the line being visible. Had pre chemo blood tests today -heaven; no needles! Dressing changed & cleaned - not so heavenly as the entry site is a bit red & sore. Nurse took a swab & I have to keep a close eye on it & temp. Not too worried though as I'm back for cycle 4 of chemo tomorrow so they will check it again. Hope everyone gets some sleep tonight or at least finds something good to watch on telly. Hope the chemo went well today and you do not have an infection. It is so great being able to have pre chemo tests without the needles and even better for the chemo itself.  Wishing you every success in the future and hope you get to love your PICC line as much as I did and I never minded people seeing it though as my treatment was in the winter it was rarely visible!

Was given a couple of fine mesh sleeves with the instruction to wear at night and in day if needed depending on clothing. Am putting cotton wool pads under clamp and stopped at end as the sleeve pushes them into my skin. Just wondering what else I can use to cover up at night. The fine mesh leaves a pattern on my skin (even though it's not night) and I think it is going yo make my skin sore. Was thinking tubigrip but hubby says will be tii tight. What have others used? Suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  ☺ I had a PICC line in and just had a dressing over it.  The main problem was getting it to stick. I did have a mesh covering it but as the District Nurse came round every week to flush the line eventually they came up with dressings that didn't make my skin sore and also stuck properly. I used to have a plastic sleeve to cover it when I had a shower, but I did used to prefer my husband to put it on for me as I was afraid of it leaking and wetting the dressing.  It was so much better than being canulated for the chemo. The nurse did put some gauze under the tubing which stopped it digging in. Hope this helps. I had the line out about 3 weeks after my last chemo in April 2016 and have had no problem since.",

I really think if it makes life easier I would like one fitted, it's bad enough having to go through all this let alone have other problems which could be overcome if a PICC line can be fitted - can anyone advise me please? Thanks in advance Lynne xx I think this depends on where you have your treatment. I had the first lot through a venepuncture but they had 2 goes at getting the canula in though the second attempt went well. I was recommended for a PICC line and had my line in before the next treatment. My veins are not that good on the side I didn't have the lymph node clearance but the doctor got the PICC line in without a problem. It is worth asking but there was about a 2 week wait for me to get it put in so you may need to have your first treatment by cannula anyway.",

I didn't use it but my husband has a dry mouth due to his medication and he uses it at night particularly. As to the teeth I did get neutropenic sepsis, and needed a stay in hospital.  Before I started my treatment I had some trouble with my teeth so I wasn't surprised when I had another abscess after discharge, needing antibiotics and an extraction. I also discovered I had developed osteoporosis and was put on Alendronic Acid. This caused delayed healing of the socket but it is fine now. I am 68. However my dentist who was wonderful referred me to a specialist dentist for the extraction which was really helpful as he was able to make sure I had the best possible chance of a full recovery. (in the end I had 1 tooth out and 2 parts of teeth) I still have to see the dentist regularly but they are really good at giving me an emergency appointment if I am worried even if there is nothing that needs to be done. Not been for several months now and feeling confident I can wait until my check up in November. Speak to the dentist and tell them you are scared I am sure they will understand and make the experience as pleasant as it can be.",

I am sure it made me really anxious as I couldn't remember what was said in the clinic. However I rang the relevant doctor's secretaries and they told me that 'most people don't want the information sent to them they just want the literature' I just said that I was not 'most people' and wanted to know. The only report I have not been able to get hold of is the initial histology report from the operation as no one seems to know where it is! I did however get a summary from both the oncologist and the surgeon which I have had to be content with. I didn't try the cold cap as I was 66 when diagnosed and my hair was going a bit thin on top anyway. Thought it might grow back better but it is much the same. It didn't take that long to come back either. Hope you manage to get some help with having another baby. Having your eggs frozen should be an option. Speaking to your BCN should be helpful or if you speak to the oncologist there may be an oncology nurse who specialises in younger people with cancer as your issues are obviously different from mine.

      "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy without reconstruction. I was originally offered a reconstruction but they had to do a biopsy of the lymph nodes first and wait for the results. I was thinking of having a reconstruction later down the line but quite honestly the prosthesis is working fine and I can't face the prospect of another operation.  I have got a prosthesis from knitted knockers UK which is especially for swimming as it is not recommended to use the silicone one as there is a possibility it could get damaged. My decision was partly based on the fact that my tumour was particularly agressive though thankfully it hadn't spread to the lymph nodes and also that because I have had abdominal surgery in the past the tissue would have had to be taken from my thigh.  I was also 67 and thought that I was just thankful it had been caught early enough for successful treatment.  I still have the option of a reconstruction at a later date but at the moment I am just happy to be able to do everything I want to without any problems. If you are thinking about having a reconstruction late it might be worth doing a bit of research into local policy.  It may mean waiting rather a long time to have it done depending on the number on the list though delaying does have the advantage that you can have your chemotherapy/radiotherapy first so that everything gets healed up before surgery. Hope you have been helped by the comments on here. Regards Mary",

In fact my husbands high blood pressure cost more than my cancer. It was less than 2 years after diagnosis and we went to Israel and had a great time.

This did help the prolapse but it reared its ugly head about a year before my diagnosis in 2015.  I have also had a hysterectomy at 38 and when I started the menopause with the hot flushes etc I went on HRT. I was on that for well over 20 years and was then advised to try to stop it.  I had stopped it about 6 mths before the diagnosis. I was referred to the gynaecologist who sent me off to the physio for pelvic floor exercises and then I was fitted with a pessary.  This sorted the prolapse but I had to have cream for the vaginal dryness. By this time I was having chemo and the oestrogen cream had to be approved by the oncologist.  As it is such a low dose and not much is absorbed it was fine and I have been using it ever since.  About a year after I finished the chemo  (aged 68) I had a repair of the prolapse and haven't looked back since. I am still using the cream twice a week (via an applicator) but otherwise can forget about it.  The gynae guy says that it was just something to blame on the children!!! My bc was triple negative but I understand you can still use the cream even if you are hormone positive. The operation was not a problem and I was only in for one day after the surgery because I had a catheter in. The surgeon told us to run up and down the stairs to make sure it was ok before we left! 2 other ladies had bladder repairs with a hysterectomy at the same time as me and they were fine too. We were given a sheet of instructions of what we could and couldn't do like hoovering and heavy lifting but I was soon back to normal.My last check up was fine and I will have a mammogram in December as planned.

As I eat red meat, dark green veg and lots of fruit, I asked what I more I could do but she said it isn't diet- related and is ordering a different sort of blood test for iron stores, which is apparently separate from the iron circulating in the blood. Just wondering if anyone else has had this, and what treatment they gave you? Many thanks x I can sympathise.  I got an infection after my second dose of docetaxol and was feeling really tired.  I went into hospital for IV antibiotics but even though my temperature was back to normal I was still very tired and my haemoglobin went down. I ended up with 2 units of blood and felt so much better afterwards. I think some people have a blood transfusion when they have chemo. It is very straightforward. Alternatively if it is not too bad the iron tablets or even injections will help but they just take a bit longer. Hope you feel better soon.",
