      "Content": "Hi Saw specialist nurse today for my assessment and bloods prior to 1st FEC75 on Thursday.  Got different messages!  She said swimming pools too full of wee and bugs etc, so are steam rooms!  OK to go to gym but strongly suggested that it should be mild exercise, nothing too strenous.  Web site says avoid gym at busiest times which I guess makes sense.  I think that hospitals seem to have slightly different policies.  As you say, best thing is to be sensible, use your common sense and do what you can.  I'm pretty healthy, and want to keep fit, but am definitely being wary about catching bugs etc.  I work in a boarding school, and oncologist and nurse have both recommended that I do not return to work for the rest of my treatment unless I can do a desk job away from the kids - erm nope!!!  Was hoping to go in on the days that I felt well - bugger!  ",

Hopefully, I will be one of the lucky ones, and not be too affected by side effects etc. My oncologist said to expect to be out of it first chemo for 7-10 days, but you recovered really well.  I don't know if it is everyone, but have heard quite a lot that the day to lose your hair is day 12, if it is going, so good luck!!!  Did you get any advice about going to the gym?  I read that gyms and swimming pools are not a good idea, due to bugs etc, but I see that lots of ladies here really enjoy the benefits. I have been getting loads of exercise though, as I can't stop decorating - nothing like painting 7ft walls to get you fit!  I'm nest building ha ha!!! Keep up the info and the positivity!! Sue",

I am going to give the cap a go - taking painkillers beforehand. How is your chemo going?  I know we hear some quite tough stories, but also that not everyone suffers as bad, My friend who has just finished chemo and has the all clear sais it's like getting flu, only difference is you know when!  Haven't been to the gym for a bit due to lymph complications, but decorating and baking like mad!!!!

I did survive the class, but phew!!!!  Love the workout, and pool.  I think the warning about gyms and pools is more to do with bugs  immune system problems, not the exercise itself?  At least I can go at quieter times with less sweaty men around (shame ha ha)  Hope your afternoon goes well, I am planning to continue teaching as much as possible between now and the summer break - the kids make me feel so alive!!!  Off painting my kitchen again now - hope you get chance to enjoy the sunshine.

Also, I work in a full time 7 day Boarding school, so we literally live, eat and breathe together!!!  I'm very lucky that my school have already arranged cover for me without me even asking, so it will be easy to manage. I will be in and out planning lessons, marking and writing reports, just not teaching.  It may seem a little over the top, but I am extremely grateful for the wonderful support that my school and colleagues have given me, and I am very aware of immune system issues, so glad that it's one less thing to worry about! It sounds like we are never going to hear the same advice twice ha ha !!",

Bit anxious as the Oncologist said that I would be starting within 2 weeks, but still not even had a call to make the assessment and now into the 3rd week.. Apparently dept is very busy, and the Oncologist should not have told me that.  I think this waiting has been the worst part of all of this!!!  I am going to try the cold cap too - not happy about cutting my hair, oh well! I did read somewhere that you have to be careful going to the gym, swimming etc in relation to immunity system/bugs? ",

This web site is a bit detailed, but it does answer your questions, and covers quite a few reasons why massage etc needs to be considered carefully.  There are issues such as lymphoedema, pressure on areas of weakness, due to not the cancer, but the treatments like weaked bone, blood count, and infection etc.  Knowledge is power!!!!

I am certainly well informed and constantly asking and learning from the professionals,although you are well ahead of me in your knowledge. You do seem to be one of the most informed people here. The reason why I was upset I think is that I have seen other opinions and some quite reckless and dangerous  behaviour here, and I was really quite concerned for those that may have read some of these posts and thought it Ok to follow suit, especially relating to immune system issues. I also felt sad that some people make comments such as 'we are not ill', when at times some of us will be, and then you feel like you are failing if not in the gym 3 hours a day etc!! I thoroughly intend to live my life to the full,but am very aware that at times I need to rein in my behaviour and be sensible for a change!!  I worked through my entire post surgery sick leave to support the kids but now it is my time. Why is it we feel that we have to justify not being 'amazing' all of the time!! Thanks for taking the time to make me feel better!!! Sue",
