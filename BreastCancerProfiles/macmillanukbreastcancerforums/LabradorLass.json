      "Content": "Hi Prinesa8 great to hear from you. Glad all is well x I know how difficult it is constantly worrying about this awful disease. The good thing is we're being monitored.  Thankfully they found my recurrance early and am being treated. So frustrating 8 years on you think you've beaten the bloody thing and beginning to relax but nope mine's back just like my poor mum's.  Just waiting to hear my options regarding this rogue lymph node which is in a difficult place to remove, the other issue is radiotherapy. They have to find my archived notes from 9 years ago to see if I have had radiotherapy in that area. If so its chemo ...... not looking forward to that again.  Oh well it is what it is. Have to get on with it. Keep smiling x",

      "Content": "Hi just joined and searched occult breast cancer, yes that was me 2008 aged 43.  Had mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy. Did have some side effects from tamoxifen giddiness and migraines but generally ok.  Unfortunately 2016 they found a slightly enlarged lymph node in my clavicle region which is difficult to remove so was given hormone suppressants. I also now have a slight patch in my pelvic bone.  To be honest I think we're considered a bit of a mystery !  But i have gone ten years and still here and at the moment it's not on any major organ I suppose i must be thankful for that Hope you're doing well x ",
