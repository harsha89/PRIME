      "Content": "I'm new to this site and wondered if anyone can help. I had surgery 10 days ago...full mastectomy and node sampling. Now my armpit feels sticky and sore. Washing doesn't seem to help. Any ideas? (Apologies if this topic has been covered before. The search facility didn't show any results, but maybe I'm not using the correct medical term!)",

      "Content": "Thanks for that. I don't think it's an infection. It's more of a sensation...there's nothing to see and the skin feels normal to the touch. I think it might be connected to damaged nerves as the whole area feels slightly numb.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the replies. I saw the breast care nurse yesterday at the post-op appointment. She was sure everything was healing normally. Just a change in sensation which should hopefully settle down with time. I'm wondering now if it could also be due to a disturbance in the sweat glands. If we have the heatwave predicted over the next few days I'll be able to compare armpits!!! She advised using Aloe Vera gel to massage the 'lumpy' areas below the scarline. When I looked at my tube of 99.9% organic hand-filleted gel I was horrified to find four different types of parabens added to it. I shall definitely be looking for an alternative, and will stick to Arnica cream for the bruising.    ",

      "Content": "Well it's more than 5 weeks since I started this thread. I'm delighted to say that my arm is 95% back to normal. The sticky soreness settled down after a couple of weeks. I've even managed to sweat a little during the hot weather! Maybe that was because I only had 5 nodes removed so that part of the surgery wasn't as invasive as it might be for some people. All that's left is a little stiffness from the centre of the chest across and into my arm which I expect will ease with time, and some numbness in the armpit. I think that's something I'll have to get used to. So, if this is all new for you, be patient!",
