      "Content": "hi everyone! recently diagnosed with DIC ER+, HER2+ 2.5cm ahhhhhh too many letters and numbers and not enough explanation given, just booklets on breast cancer and reconstruction which are great but sometimes you just need a person to go through it! been told I will need to have a mastectomy and SLN biopsy which was devastating news had hoped lumpectomy would be enough I live alone - well there is Bob my fab cat who has been very affectionate lately, I so should have known something was wrong he's not normally so clingy  its so nice to see so many supportive comments here, I hope to be able to express my feelings etc here as meow meow  is starting to not be enough! ",
