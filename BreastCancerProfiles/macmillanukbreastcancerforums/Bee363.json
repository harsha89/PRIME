      "Content": "Hi Carolyn,  Thanks for your reply. Yes I'm sure I will have to get used to this rollercoaster ride that I didn't want to go on!  I've now got another appointment for next week with the consultant to discuss surgery. I've now managed to convince myself they missed something terrible on my biopsy results do now I'm an urgent case! The nurse did say that on first look it appeared I may have been eligible for a trial which is why I was having chemo first. Now it seems I'm not. Brain working overtime again.... Sally PS why the dentist?? Should I be worried about that too??  Oh dear today really not a good one.",

      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed last week and was told the plan was for me to have chemo first to shrink the tumour then surgery after. However today they have rang to say they've have changed their minds and it will be surgery first. This has thrown me. On top of this I'd had my bone scan appointment letter so I was already having a wobble. Feeling really vulnerable today after initially calm. Sally",

      "Content": "Hi Ronstar Thank you for replying. Yes I think I will feel more settled once everything in place. Weirdly before last week's appointment I'd assumed I'd have surgery first as that seems the norm. It threw me when I was told the opposite. So just got my head around that and they throw this curve ball at me. Something I need to get used to I suppose as they tweak your treatment. Just really anxious today, I've been really positive up to this point but not having a good day today. Feeling angry and emotional. Only to be expected I suppose.  Onwards and upwards.  Sally",

Not quite sunk in that's it yet I don't think!  Have a date for first meeting with radio team on 27th April, so next stage on the way. Also a chat yesterday regarding tamaxoxifen which I start in 3 weeks time.  So a few days of feeling rubbish next week then recovery starts!  Hope everyone else doing ok and if you're just starting out it really is doable. Even in the darkest moments it's amazing how you bounce back! It whizzes by too I promise!  Sallyx",

They're not lying when they say it's cumaltive!  I've had 4 FEC and 4 T and managed pretty well but this one has floored me.  Luckily husband is off till tomorrow so hoping I see an improvement after that.  Was so excited to finish too, hey ho hopefully will be subsiding soon and at least no count down till next one!  Hope you're all doing ok and managed to enjoy the Easter break.

Nails are still sore and a couple a bit black so possibly will loose these.  However went to a concert with my daughter last night and may have been just what the doctor ordered as feeling brighter today! Or could just be I'm finally arriving at my good week!! Better late than never!  Have my RT planning session on Thursday and will start 3 weeks later apparently.  Good luck to all just starting out, it is doable and goes quickly. But soooooo glad it's finished lol!  Sally x",

      "Content": "JennyEm Sally  Sorry to hear your having a crappy time and feeling low. I am not even close to where you are with treatment at the moment so I can only imagine what you're going through. However going out and doing fun stuff I think certainly helps. Having stuff planned a little way in advance helps to have something to look forward to (granted I'm sure it's dependant on how you feel on the day but nonetheless). My partner and I have decided to have something planned once a month, nothing major but a little treat for us both. We're having a little overnight stay in a hotel next week and planning a few spa sessions for the end of the month. Just little things to look forward to. Who'd you go see?  Sending you hugs xx Hi JennyEm Ed Sheeran! He was amazing!  Definitely helps to have something to look forward to! I always made sure I did something nice with friends in my good week. On the whole always managed a good week too, just this last one that has taken its toll.  Good luck with the rest of your treatment!  Sally x",
