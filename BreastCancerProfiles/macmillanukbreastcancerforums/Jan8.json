    "Content": "Hi Looby7 I had my biopsy yesterday and the radiologist told me not to worry at all if the area feels sore and tender the next day - it's perfectly normal and just a reaction to the test itself.  I am waiting for my results and my emmotions are all over the place, so I can totally sympathise but stay positive, stay focused and believe in yourself. Think of the hugs you will give your kids when you next seem them !! Jan x   ",
