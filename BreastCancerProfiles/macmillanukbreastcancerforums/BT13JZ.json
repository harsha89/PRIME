    "Content": "Hey Laura, I am new to the forum and embarking on a tough journey ahead. My mum has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is having a biopsy on her liver tomorrow. If she has cancer there then they cant operate :( and its chemo. I am also waiting on results for my husbands carcinoid tumor scan which is on the 10th Aug - I have double bubble at the moment :( I agree that the waiting is a killer. Whilst I am fortunate that I am not the one who is ill - the waiting and the fact I can't do anything is killing me inside. I have to stay strong for everyone but I am not sleeping and I keep getting a wave of anxiety. Â Keep strong mate x",
