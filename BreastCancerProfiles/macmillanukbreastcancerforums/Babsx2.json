      "Content": "Hi Sue, I might not be able to help that much but I had trans flap recon using muscle and skin from my back on my right side in December. My reconstruction was done about 15mths after my mastectomy and luckily I didn't have radiotherapy. At times it feels very peculiar especially when I do housework,dusting etc when I lean over. Getting out of bed and standing upright with the implant repositioning was awkward too. Doesn't hurt but pulls across obviously where the muscle is, and I can still feel funny sensation in my back where muscle was, and at the moment I am lopsided. I haven't had nipple done either, but I am going back in to have my left breast either uplifted or reduced to match my right in July and will think of having nipple done. Hopefully they will feel more equal then. You don't say when your op was done, if it was fairly recently that might account for the strange feeling. I massaged Bio Oil into the scar area which eased it and made skin feel much better. If you feel the implant might be hardening it might be a good idea to contact your breast care nurse who will either put your mind at ease or refer you back to your surgeon. I hope I may have been some help, Babs",

      "Content": "Don't be frightened to talk (talking helps) or feel a fraud because you don't need other treatment. I felt exactly the same back in 2006 when I was diagnosed with bc. I came back from a holiday in Cyprus to find a letter with an appointment for my 'op.' Needing to change the date I went in to the hospital to be told by the receptioist ' Oh yes, mastectomy'. Like you I was stunned, so certain that my biopsies would have proven to be benign. Luckily my husband was in the car waiting for me and the nurses and doctor who sat down with us to explain were wonderful!! I was lucky, I had the mastectomy which went well, no problems and I didn't need further treatment, just Tamoxifen for 5 years. I have since had reconstruction of my breast and am waiting for a nipple reconstruction on 23rd March, things do get better. There are some wonderful people on this site who are more articulate than me who will contact you.But please don't feel you shouldn't talk about it. Best wishes Babs",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon, I read your letter with interest as I was diagnosed with bc in August 2006. It was a big shock and I still sometimes feel it hasn't really happened.I had to have a mastectomy and my lymph nodes taken away.I was petrified at the thought of having chemo or radiotherapy and luckily got away with tamoxifen then arimidex. Someone I worked with had bc 2 years before me and had to have mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy and seemed to enjoy telling me how lucky I was. I felt I had to keep apologising for not having anymore treatment. What I wanted to say was, don't feel guilty. Take one day at a time and be prepared for days when you want to cry.Talk about it to anyone who will listen even if their eyes start to glaze over. It does help! I had breast reconstruction back in December and I finally feel that I can smile again. Things do get better! best wishes Barbara",
