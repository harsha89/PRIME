    "Content": "/I became cancer free on the 08/09/2016, and I wondered if anyone is having problems like I am. I had chemo, radio, Herceptin and then I was on tamaxifen for4half years, I have recently been changed to letrozole, as I was having bleeding down below, however this is sorted now. While was on Herceptin I had aching feet and legs. Now I am on letrozole I am really struggling with the pains in my feet and hands even getting to the point where its hurting to walk, also cramps in toes and fingers, my oncologist is monitoring this, and have to go back in November, I feel like ive took one step forward and two steps back its really causing me anxiety. Anybody had these problems?",
