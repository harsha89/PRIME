      "Content": "Hi , I\u2019m new to this site , and hope to find some comfort from positive responses.  I was diagnosed 4th sept her2- grade 3 left breast , confident no lymph node involvement.  26th sept had mastectomy and reconstruction and 3 lymph nodes removed again positive no involvement . I went to see the surgeon 2 days ago , she is lovely but she floored me with the news that 2 of the 3 lymph nodes taken had small deposits of cells .  I am now awaiting scans before chemotherapy , I was so positive and now feel like I\u2019m in limbo. I\u2019m terrified as I have 2 young children age12 and 5 and I\u2019m super brave in front of them but on my own I\u2019m just a blubbering wreck as I\u2019m worried what my future holds . X",

      "Content": "In fact Thankyou all for your responses and sharing your journeys with me.   I\u2019m dreading the whole process of it all , at least the first hurdle is done  ( mastectomy). It all seems a lifetime away before it ends . And it\u2019s just beginning really .  My children are my focus , I have no choice but to get through it , once the scans are done I guess I will just move forward with the next hurdle  Im determined to make everyday a positive day ( although I\u2019m struggling today)   thankyou so much ladies .
