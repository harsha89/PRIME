    "Content": "Hi Beachbabe I was in the same position you are in the weekend before last. My head felt so sore like someone was pulling my hair really hard and I couldn't lie down or put any pressure on it at all. It's crap- but I found once I cropped it really short it felt less painful. I got my 12 year old niece to cut it with clippers in the garden! Now its more or less all fallen out. It's tough ( didn't realise how vain I was until I did it) but you get used to it. Getting used to my wig now and also found some really good cotton beanies on an american website called headcovers unlimitedl Reasonable postage too. I feel comfortable going out in them and don't fell that anyone is looking at me - they just look like cool hats! If you can hold your head up high and look confident you feel it and so just go for it! It's a means to an end and it'll grow back. Good luck. xx",
