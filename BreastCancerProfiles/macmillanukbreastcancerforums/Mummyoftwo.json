    "Content": "Hi You have had some good advice on here already. I was diagnosed with stage 3 bc last year, when my kids were 9 and nearly 2. I think that your eldest child will struggle the most, because s/he will understand more of the risks and probably have heard about cancer on tv, from friends already. Also pre-teens can be more emotional. Younger children need everything in black and white: such as \"Mummy is going into hospital soon. The doctors are going to take away her poorly booby. She won't be able to pick you up or do much for a while, but she will get better one day.\"  One  child may be very upset while the other barely registers, they are all different and handle it in different ways. My best advice is to be honest. Kids pick up quickly if their parents are hiding things from them. They will find it tough, but will be surprisingly resilient at times too. I had a double mx, which meant I was very dependent on my husband and others, for over a month. I could clean and dress myself after a few days, but was not able to cook or clean or dress the kids etc for a while. Make sure that you get help. Who will be looking after your children? Who will be doing the housework? Can you ask friends to cook dinner for you and bring it round, after you are out of hospital? It's best to get these plans in place asap. Also do make sure that your kids' teachers are updated and on side, it will make life much easier for them.  My son didn't like the Medikidz book at all, but the Mummy's Lump one is good. In case it helps, I wrote a short story for young children on my blog at naartjietippex.wordpress.com/.../ I will be thinking of you. X Alex",
