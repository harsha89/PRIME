      "Content": "Hi ladies,  good evening to all you lovely strong ladies or should I say good morning !!!   wel another night of not sleeping - got 3rd tax tomorrow - so after steroids today no sign of sleep in sight yet Hey ho give me chance to have a catch up on here and do a little reading - always a silver lining.  I was wondering also how to join the Facebook chat. Not sure if there are different groups but I live in birmingham, started chemo in feb and I'm 39 yrs old.  If sI done could help please.  Really hoping this tax is easier than other two - ended up in hospital both times first time neutropenic and second with an infection feeling awful.  Feel like all I've done for six weeks is pop antibiotics and loads of other pills.  But still fingers crossed.   Hope all you lovelies have had a good weekend   With love n hugs  Anastasia xx xx xx  keep kicking ass",

      "Content": "Hi all,  I came home yesterday with a weeks worth of antibiotics after four days days in hospital with high temp and infection. I had my first tax two weeks ago. I feel awful both physically and emotionally. my hair is really starting to fall out which mentally I was prepared for but the pain and soreness of my scalp and head I didn't expect and its all just getting too much.   Ive been told that I may have to have injections with next chemo. I'm due to see oncologist this Friday.  I think the reality of everything has hit me over last few days and has sent my emotions into a spin. I was trying to be positive but now every ache or pain sends me into a spin.   my family and friends have been incredibly worried but also amazingly supportive and I find it difficult telling them how low I feel they try so hard to keep my spirits up.  Thank you for letting me rant.  Best wishes to you all you're all amazing.  Bests wishes Anastasia xxx xxx ",

      "Content": "hi all you lovely ladies,  Thank you for all your words of support and encouragement.  It helps to know you can have a rant and people understand and don't think you're going to fall apart completely !!! You're support is amazing.  I agree sue, being strong and smiling is exhausting  but to tell everyone how hard it is would be harder to see their faces and hear their concerns Especially when they try so hard and especially when it's always been me whose the strong one !!!! Think that's what makes this worse    I have felt a little brighter today.  Although still can't get over the pain in my head. So hoping tomorrow will be a better day.  Sending bestcwishes to you all - keep fighting.  With hugs Anastasia xx ",
