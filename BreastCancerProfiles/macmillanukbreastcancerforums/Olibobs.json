      "Content": "Hi everyone In January I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, I had surgery and radiotherapy.  When they did the CT scan for the radiotherapy planning they found something on my lung.  They did a repeat, more detailed CT scan 6 weeks later and it was still there.  I've now been referred to a lung specialist I can't help but worry constantly that I have lung cancer...I'm getting myself in a bit of a state over it. I'm guessing that there will be lots of other tests first to diagnose anything and that they won't know what it is just from the CT scans but this has just come as a real blow. Can anyone offer any advise.....thank you ",
