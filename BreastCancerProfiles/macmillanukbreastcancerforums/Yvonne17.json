Here goes and i am not much good with the correct words so I will ask my question in words that I know . My husband and me don't have sex now because I don't want it , I get no feelings at all of wanting sex, I am 53 & my hubby is 54 we have a fabulous marriage we have had our ups & downs like every one but we have always worked through what ever together. It's a year this February the 18th since I was diagnosed with breast cancer so I've had my operation & radiothapy I just take my medication now Anastrozole/Exemestane & it works great for me, i'am also on Citalopram for my depression & anxiety & it works great for me so I don't want to come off my medication to try a different one. Is their a medication that I could take that would make me want to have sex with my hubby? Because I know that you have to have sex in a marriage, it's got to the stage now if I am on my day off I say to my self right i'am going to have sex tonight but then when night comes i'am in bed at 6-30 because I am worn out . I've spoke to my hubby about it he just keeps saying don't worry but I am getting very worried about it I keep thinking he's a man and may find some one to go with. I've never been or classed my self as a sexy woman in fact I have never enjoyed sex a lot of times I just pretended because as a small child I was sexually abused but my hubby knows all about this and he was fabulous when we first got married in fact he's fabulous now it's me because I know he must need sex any help I would be so grateful and if I have up set any of my very brave friends for been so forward I am sorry I can't ask any one else please help lots of love Yvonne xxxxxxx",

I still told my self there's been a mistake , went to see my surgeon Mr Clark he's so nice n understanding I just sat n nodded because I knew he was wrong because I have not got cancer . My breast nurse is fabulous she's kind supporting I just agreed with her because she is so nice I thought I can't tell this nurse she's made a mistake . My Macmillan nurse is fab she's a lovely person so I could not tell her she's made a mistake . My GP is fantastic I can talk to him about out so I did not like to offend him by saying you have made a mistake . Then this morning I got my little card thro post that my GP filled in for me to get free prescriptions for 5 years , I've looked all day n held this little card & I'am starting to think all these professional people in good jobs can't be all wrong I think they may be right I think I've got breast cancer n I'am starting to panic a bit I think . What if they are all right but they must be right . I've done this all my life from being very little I block things out I pretend there not happening instead of dealing with things. And stupid little things I panic like mad over I've got all my letters upstairs from hospital with my hospital dates in what started out as one appointment n one letter is now 3 appointments n 3 letters I know they all can't be wrong n I don't know if this is making any sence but I could cry because I think there right love Yvonne I'll close now or I'll just go on n on xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Fadima hope your having a good night I wrote a post like yours not so long ago as my operation was a success , i had finished my radiotherapy had follow up appointments at hospital with docs & just have to take Exemestane for 5 years , I got the all clear , but I could not understand why I was not jumping around, why was I not my normal self, why was I not me, why was me still lost, and we're was I lost at. All these questions & no answers but with loads of help & support from all my lovely friends from this site I got to a safe place but a different place that was new to me. I still have times were I go out of my way & look for my normal self but I only confuse my self as that place has gone i'am not lost i have just moved to a new bright better place were my new me lives. It's so very hard for me to explain but what your going thro is all normal after cancer you have to learn to take your time take one day at a time remember your in recovery from breast cancer and it's so hard you will have bad days & good days for me being in recovery from breast cancer is much harder than my breast cancer ever was just take one day at a time take good care love n hugs Yvonne xxxx . Hope my text is a little helpful & you can understand the way I write things down as I repeat my self & I tend to ramble on a bit xxxx",

Maybe that's why it's so painful but I have not got a temp but I think I will go to docs just in case it's my glands under my arm I think I'am making it worse because I keep feeling my boob I keep checking for lumps I know that's stupid because when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in February I had no pain in my boob it was not even uncomfortable this is how stupid I am I thought my boobs were growing but the problem was I would say \"I've only got one boob growing & getting big\" as I've always had little boobs ha ha xxxxx",
