    "Content": "This may be the spin The Guardian put on the reports, but from what I've read, this isn't about blaming the individual, it's about the environment in which we live.  It talks about people who have migrated from low cancer areas (the country? - not specified) to high cancer areas (cities?, again not specified), taking on the cancer rate of the area they have moved to.  So, the only way to reduce the risk is to move to a low cancer area.  Not very practical, but looking at the risks in the high cancer areas might be more helpful. Any blame to the individual is a form of magical thinking - she/he did this or that and got cancer.  I don't, so therefore I will be safe.  As we all know, that is nonsense.",
