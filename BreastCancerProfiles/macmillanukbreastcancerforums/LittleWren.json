I am a great believer in positive thinking and healthy eating but sometimes you just want to be miserable or angry and eat crap. I get really fed up of people telling me inspirational stories about how someone beat cancer just by eating brocolli and meditating.  My friends have been mostly supportive but I have dropped a few - one  told me that now I have cancer no one will want to date me (like that's a priority) and I'd basically die alone riddled with tumours and get eaten by the cat (ok so I exaggerate a little).  I have found this site invaluable. There always seems to be someone who knows exactly what you are going through.",

It was done under local anaesthetic and took about 45 minutes - I think it doesn't usually take as long as this but there was a student learning.  Afterwards it was all wrapped up and covered and they told me just to ignore it (apart from not getting it wet - you can wrap it in cling film for the shower but I've ordered a waterproof cover from Amazon). The nurses on the oncology unit will flush it out for me so going to the hospital weekly is a bit of a pain - but I feel like I'm practically living there at the moment so I guess one more visit a week won't hurt. I think who cleans it out depends on where you live. My chemo starts next week and the whole process should be quicker and easier now I have the line in. Hopefully no injections. My mum is knitting me a cover for it - not too sure what that will be like but she offered. Good luck with whatever you decide. ",

While it doesn't appear to have grown it has become quite painful and is now clearly visible so something is going on and it's not shrinkage. The oncologist is starting me on Taxotere next week and hopefully that will do the trick. He said it is very very rare for a person not to respond to EC or taxotere and even if they don't there are always other options. I was really upset and frustrated, especially as that morning my hair started falling out and I wondered if it was falling out for nothing. At the time I was annoyed with my oncologist as he didn't seem concerned but now I think if he's not concerned then I shouldn't be either. He did say right from the beginning we would have to be flexible. For me, I just wanted to be able to have some good news to tell people for a change. I started a thread called Tumour Pain on this board and lots of lovely people responded with similar stories so we are not alone in this even though sometimes it feels like it's one step forward and three steps back.  Hopefully we will both get a good outcome soon.",

I also think that the majority of people who brave the shave will be men not women, and of course they will be doing it entirely out of choice. For them it will be fun and a bit of a laugh. I am new to hair loss and I'm sure I will get used to it but at the moment (after I've got rid of the hair on my pillow, in the plug hole and all over my clothes) when I look in the mirror, I don't see me anymore. I see someone in a headscarf or wearing a wig and I see someone sick and someone everyone else feels sorry for, which is ironic as the chemo side effects aren't hitting me all that hard and physically I feel pretty good.  People seem to have a horrible fascination with the hair loss. The first thing a lot of people ask me isn't about the cancer or how I'm feeling, but about hair.  I feel that the Brave the Shave campaign trivialises something that is very upsetting to a lot of people and also makes it feel abnormal - it's something so horrendous you'd have to be paid to go through it. Hair loss isn't on a par with sitting in a bath of baked beans - it's genuinely upsetting and destroys people's confidence and sense of self.  There must be better fundraisers - why do people have to be sponsored to do anything when they could just make a donation?",

Is it just me or is that utterly insensitive? I would love to have the choice to grow my hair but instead my choice is between a headscarf or a wig and now I find I can't even take someone to the dentist without being reminded that I have cancer and to some people it's all a bit of a laugh.  I know it's not MacMillan's fault that someone has written this as their story, but I do think that this illustrates perfectly that this campaign does nothing to raise awareness or understanding of what people with cancer are going through. All it has done is make me angry and upset. ",

      "Content": "Hi mistymoley I saw the oncologist on Monday and he confirmed that the tumour has shrunk by 30%. He explained about the dead tissue and that it appears to be shrinking from the back of the breast outwards which is why it probably doesn't feel as if it's shrinking. He said that with EC it did appear to be growing which is why he stopped it. It is true that it had started to bulge out of the breast. These are all questions I think could have been answered when I asked them a few weeks ago which annoys me. The first time I spoke to the Breast Care Nurse she said if it's not growing now that's probably a good sign. That was really all I needed to hear to put my mind at ease and would have been good if one of the oncologist's I've seen could have said it to me. I know they can't give false hope, but the word 'probably' qualifies it. I'm not going to ask for another oncologist because I've already seen two and haven't heard good reports about any of the others so I think I might have the best of a bad lot. A friend who has been through a very similar experience to mine in America told me to remember that to them my case is probably very straightforward - I am doing what I'm told, attending all my appointments, taking my medication correctly, not refusing treatment, eating reasonably healthily and exercising, no lymph node involvement and until recently I haven't made a fuss. She said that they have much more complex cases and difficult patients to deal with and they forget that what's run of the mill (even boring) to them is life changing to us. I don't know if this is true but I found it oddly comforting. Anyway, feeling much more positive. Got my next chemo today. All going well I will have 5 tax (was originally going to be 4 EC and 4 tax). I will be finished chemo on 7 September which isn't far away (Yay!). Hopefully, surgery and radiotherapy will be done by Christmas. ",

Initially, I was pretty sure I didn't want a reconstruction as I just wanted to get my life back to normal as soon as possible. However, now I'm wondering if this is the right decision. Most people my age (45) seem to go for a reconstruction so I was wondering if anyone could advise me of the advantages and disadvantages of both. How soon do I have to make this decision? Also, if I decide not to have a reconstruction, can I change my mind about this later? One of the factors shaping my decision will be what recovery is like as I live alone with no family close enough to take care of me. My mum will come down post-operation but I'm not sure how long she can stay.",

      "Content": "Hello - sorry for the long post below. I was diagnosed with TNBC back in April. At the time of diagnosis I was copied in on a letter the surgeon wrote to my GP stating the lump was 6cm. A few weeks later before starting chemo my oncologist wrote to my GP saying the lump was 8 x 6 cm so had grown 2 cm in a few weeks. I started chemo and after one EC the oncologist moved me onto taxotere because the lump hadn't responded. I have had two taxotere and am due number three on Wednesday. Each time I've seen the oncologist he has expressed doubt that it is responding to the chemo despite me telling him the lump has changed shape and has been very painful so something has been happening. I have found it very hard to get him to answer my questions. Whenever I ask anything, he tells me to think positive and that's it. I am all in favour of positive thinking but he hasn't given me anything to think positive about. Anyway, yesterday I kicked up an almighty fuss (not something that comes easily to me but angry crying worked a treat) and my breast care nurse arranged for me to have a mammogram and ultrasound at the Breast Care Unit today. The Dr doing the ultrasound was the one I saw when originally diagnosed and she confirmed that she could see it was responding well and that it had never been as big as 6 cm in the first place and she didn't know why the oncologist would have said it was so big. I forget the exact measurements but it is now something like 3.5 x 4.5 cm.  This is obviously good news. But for the last few weeks I've been really anxious because I thought I had a massive aggressive lump that wasn't responding to treatment. As I'm TNBC chemo is all they have to throw at it. I started to think that there's no point planning for the future. My father passed away from cancer in May so when I had to tell my mother I have cancer too and that it didn't appear to be responding to treatment she was devastated. I am excited to have some good news to tell her now and my mind has been put at ease a bit. However, I can feel the lump and my very crude measurements tell me the mass is big and more like 6 cm than 4.5. I believe the ultrasound Dr's measurement - she's the breast care expert and the one with the machine, but I'm wondering why the oncologist would have said it was so large and what it is that is making it seem larger and if anyone has a similar experience or can shed any light on this? Sorry for the long ranty post - just feeling a mixture of frustration, puzzlement and relief.",

I wish I had got in touch with her sooner as she has been fantastic.  It's a weird business - my other breast which is clear has been having weird twinges and a scar from years ago has also started tingling.

      "Content": "I try to avoid statistics where possible though I did find the 90% stat comforting initially until I started over-thinking it and finding all the reasons why I'm in the other 10% - I'm triple negative, my lump is big and doesn't seem to be responding to chemo as well as they were expecting etc etc. I've come to the conclusion that unless someone can come up with statistics that cover people with exactly the same circumstances as me, then I don't really want to know. In the end we are all different and breast cancer comes in so many forms that any stats are going to be generalised.  My chances of getting breast cancer were something like 0.9% but I got it. With a lump the size of mine, the chances of it not being in the lymphs was slim, but they tell me there's no node involvement so statistically I feel like a bit of an anomaly.",

      "Content": "Hi Debs I live alone and am due to have my third chemo next week. Like you, I find living alone can be a bit of a blessing - If I'm feeling rough I can do whatever I want without having to worry about anyone else so if all I want to do is lie on the sofa watching rubbish TV and eating trash then that's exactly what I do.  I have had lots of offers of help but I'm really independent so it's been hard for me to accept that sometimes I need to accept their offers but I have realised what a wonderful group of people I have around me. People just want to help however they can.  I have a cat but was given no advice about her. She is a real attention seeking lap cat and loves to snuggle up with me. I don't let her in the bedroom at night any more and wear gloves and a mask for the litter tray but apart from that we are carrying on as normal. I do use anti-bacterial gel regularly just in case. ",
