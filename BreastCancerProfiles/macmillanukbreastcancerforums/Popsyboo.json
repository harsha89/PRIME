    "Content": "First of all, I'd like to comment on how uplifting it is to see so many positive stories. As someone newly diagnosed, it's been a difficult few weeks, but my heart is lighter having seen other's comments. To my problem - I have invasive ductal carcinoma which has spread through my axillary lymph nodes and to a node in the breast (thought that was the primary), but post-op pathology revealed all the tissue was of secondary origin. I've had a CT scan and a bone scan, both of which were negative (phew!), and an MRI which appears not to have found the primary tumour either. I await further biopsy results, but one is likely to be lymphatic spread further from the breast tissue, and the other is not expected to be tumour at all, but being checked out as an anomaly just in case. I'm trying to be calm and practical about it, and I know that the investigations must run their course before my chemo can start, but I'm a bit scared that this primary is eluding everyone. Has anyone else been in this situation?",
