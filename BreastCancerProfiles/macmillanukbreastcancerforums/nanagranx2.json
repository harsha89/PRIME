      "Content": "Hello Minky I had lumpectomy in September,results 2 weeks later were a mixed bag,clear margins and downgraded but the one lymph node taken showed a small amount of cancer.I was recommended to have node clearance and chemo.I decided against both,I have since had radiotherapy to the lymph nodes as well as my breast , I was told chemo would increase my chances of being cancer free in five years by only 3%, a percentage I am happy to take a risk with,but it is a very personal choice and one that requires a lot of thought. Hope you make the decision that is right for you. Helen",

I decided not to go for mode clearance or chemotherapy,and am now undergoing radiotherapy. My surgeon told me chemo would increase my chances of being cancer free in 10 years by 3%, I thought that was a small percentage and one I was happy to take a chance on, both my surgeon and breast care nurse were  happy with the decision however they were not so happy about me not going for node clearance .but In the end,as you say, the decision is ours alone. Wishing you all the best",

I had 15 sessions of radiotherapy and am now on hormone tablets for the next 5 years The waiting for surgery then the waiting for results really is the worst.

It is scary and hard to take in ,you've just got your head around one course of treatment outlined to you and then it is changed.But as you say there are a lot of positive people and experiences on here and you are guaranteed suport,I have found it a great help and I am sure you will Helen",
