I love Maggies and have done the yoga there rather than the choir. I really don\u2019t have any musical ability so you\u2019re better off without my dulcet tones!",

If you think of any drama which has comedy aspects they have to sanitise it or no one would watch it. That\u2019s what cold feet is a comedy drama.  Thinkof how well the young suicidal man made such a startling recovery. We all know that life is never that straightforward.

      "Content": "hi has anyone been watching the new series of Cold Feet on ITV? If so do you think Jenny is depicting the experience well?. I live in Manchester and am currently studying for a degree as a (very) mature student so it is very close to home for me. - literally. :) I have to say applying for an assignment extension wasn\u2019t quite as straightforward as Jenny made out. The best bits for me was when she said to her friend \u2018It\u2019s not ok it\u2019s sh*#\u2019 and the lovely scene in the hospital with the young man. I hope people are having a good day x ",

Went to the GP as I thought my headaches were a side effect but he\u2019s sent me for an urgent brain scan to rule out cancer! He said he wouldn\u2019t be doing his job properly if he didn\u2019t send me but still my mind\u2019s in overdrive......... on a positive note no side effects from radiotherapy. Trying to look on the bright side :).......",

Really strange actually because I went out last night for a celebration because my treatment had ended, had Japanese food a couple of beers and went dancing and today feel better than everyone else!!!  You are are right I\u2019m looking at it as the Gp doing it as a precautionary measure because I presented with the symptoms. I can\u2019t change anything by worrying so I\u2019m trying not to. Of course the beer helped :)  thank you for replying. It\u2019s is so great to know that there are people who get it and who are kind enough to reply. ",

I feel a lot calmer too which is a good thing. It does sound like letrazole has quite a lot of horrible side effects. Your eye problem sounds awful so fingers crossed the change of meds works for you. Let me know how it goes Bye for now ",
