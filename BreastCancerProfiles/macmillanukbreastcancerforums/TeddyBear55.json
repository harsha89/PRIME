Also I only had the one Mugs scan although I expected to have one mid way through and at the end but this never happened ,  no explanation why was ever given. I also think you shouldn't go back to work, good luck, chemotherapy is very do-able. xxx",

      "Content": "Morning  Have you tried putting slices of lemon orange or lime in the water? I found Aldi\u2019s flavoured water was my saviour and still drink at least a bottle of it a day now (finished treatment September 17). Hope you find something especially if you go on to have radiotherapy as drinking loads really does help prevent fatigue. Good luck Pam",
