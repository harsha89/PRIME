      "Content": "I work in a vets and we have been asked by our head office to display a sign in the waiting area and consult rooms about vaccines and immunocompromised  clients.   It advises asking the vets advice before having a pets vaccine administered.  It is mainly the kennel cough that is a live vaccine, I think part of the concern is that some dogs can sneeze for a while after having it and so spread it around !    It\u2019s similar to concerns about avoiding  children who have had the  flu vaccine really. ",

      "Content": "Hi careermindedoptimist I\u2019m pretty similar to you , grade 3 , er+ , Her neg , nodes clear , 11mm IDC  and 10mm DCIS .   I had a lumpectomy though.  I\u2019ve had my Oncotype result which unfortunately was 42. So Chemo is starting in 10 days.   Don\u2019t know what I would have decided if it had been in the intermediate area , think I would still lean towards chemo but it\u2019s all down to personal decision I suppose.  Nothing else to add at the moment as just waiting for it all to start .   I meet the chemo nurses on a Thursday to go through what\u2019s going to happen and see the chemo department.  Best of luck for your results  Jo x",
