I seem to heal great for a week or so then my wounds open again or I get another infection. I'm being treated at ninewells hospital in Dundee Scotland. Thanks for the hug kacang ",

I think the radio therapy is supposed to get rid of it but as it's getting bigger again I have no idea what's going to happen. My girls are the reason I keep going. Obviously I don't want to let cancer win but everything going wrong is getting me down xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone. I'm not sure what it's classed as, all I know is I haven't had a chance to finish the first lot of treatments. I have to get 3 weeks of radio therapy and scans, I guess they'll know more then. I'm just really confused because after my operation I was told all the cancer was gone but they couldn't remove the lymph node as my nerves and veins run through it. I've been left to heal for 3 months without any scans to keep a look out. If it wasn't for my arm and hand being painful and loosing function I doubt I would even know any of this right now. All the doctors tell me different things and it's so confusing and frustrating. I have no faith in them anymore unfortunately.",
