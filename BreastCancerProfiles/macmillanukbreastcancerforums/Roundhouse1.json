      "Content": "Hi  i wanted to post an update on mum. After speaking with her breast care nurse we managed to get her results a week early! Good news that they took 7 lymph nodes and all were clear and they Told her they \u201cgot it all\u201d. Mum was shocked as she was fully expecting the worst as previously mentioned. She has perked up slightly but now is on anti depressants but she\u2019s only been on them for a week.  She\u2019s slightly better then she was as she now knows that\u2019s it\u2019s not in her lymph but now it\u2019s the unknown with chemo. I\u2019d imagine this is the norm as you don\u2019t know what to expect. She wants a wig before her hair starts falling out which we can sort.  Hopefully she s on the road to recovery from the BC and mentally well that might take more time but she has the right support now.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi  I\u2019m awake at 3am as this is bothering me so felt compelled to put this into writing and get it off my chest. I have posted before about my 62 year old mother not coping with her BC diagnosis and 8 weeks on I thought she might be in a slightly better place but she\u2019s not. She had a LB mastectomy last week and was slightly upbeat whilst in hospital and for a few hours I had my old mum back.  Now back at home she is back to an all time low and negative thoughts. She\u2019s Her2+ And had 2 lumps 8mm + 11mm that\u2019s were found through routine mammogram so she couldn\u2019t feel them. Me and my immediate family are at a complete loss of what else we can do because no matter what we say/try to help her she just thinks the worst. She thinks that they will find something else and that her histology results will say it\u2019s in lymph and that means it\u2019s everywhere and then it game over. After weeks of refusing to speak with anyone in the same boat she agreed to speak with someone but she says her BC isn\u2019t the same as mine (she thinks it\u2019s a rare form - we know it\u2019s not). She\u2019s had diazepam for help short term with anxiety although we did take her to see about AD and then she refused them as she didn\u2019t want them to interfere with treatment (again we know this isn\u2019t the case)! I\u2019ve had her referred for counselling with Macmillan and this is something she says she will arrange and she will go to. She\u2019s now thinking AD is what she needs and to be honest I think so to as she just cannot snap out of this.  This is sounds selfish and it\u2019s not meant to be but the impact mums attitude is having is bringing us all down. We are trying to be upbeat and positive as we have been told this is treatable but mums having none of it. She literally does not believe anyone not even her consultant at times. We have to carry on as best as we can with this on our minds and work full time jobs as well as frantically worry about mums mental state of mind. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s going to get though chemo without a strong mental attitude but again it\u2019s not me going through is so how can I judge and say get a grip?  Has anyone else experienced this personally or with family? Does this get any easier for Mum and for us? I will keep dealing with what I have to but I believe I may crack (which I already have done once and had to have a week off work). I know I\u2019m not going to get my old mum back and she\u2019s said ad much, I just can\u2019t see a future at all at the minute but I refuse this beast to ruin our lives!! Mum can\u2019t even be positive for the sake of others and she\u2019s cutting herself off from people and won\u2019t let family visit her which is extra pressure on us. She has no patience for her grandchildren who are now asking questions and want to see Nanna but she\u2019s shutting everyone out.  As you can probably tell I\u2019m overtired have broken sleep again and am at a loss. I\u2019m sick of work colleagues telling me I look pale and tired! Sorry for the long rant.......any advise would be great. THANK YOU XX",

      "Content": "Hi Paula  Ive been around to see mum today and given her a frank talking to which resulted in me having a crying fit! GP has been rang and will hopefully be issuing mum with AD which i think she needs. These are not a quick fix but she is not coping at all on her own and she even let slip that she has been writing down what bills Dad needs to pay should the worst happen.  She also agreed I could make her an appointment with her Macmillan councillor which she is having in a couple of weeks which I am hoping will help. It is awful to see her this way but these are now steps in her wanted to get out of this mindset.  I asked her what would she do if this was me and I was behaving this way and she said \"i would drag you to the hospital / doctors myself\".  I think I needed the outburst with mum as its made her realise that myself and immediate family cannot do this alone.  Thank you to everyone for your helpful words. xx",

To my knowledge mum had never had depression in the past however she said she has always had fear over health and she hates hospitals and going to see the doctor. I know that this is completely doable I just need to convince mum of this and I agree with everything you had said.  Thank you",

She has a wig but obviously you don\u2019t know how you will feel. She\u2019s been really depressed but seems fine today. I\u2019m sure this will change again which is going to be awful xx",

She\u2019s Her2+ and we know mri results have said just in the breast where we thought. We know it\u2019s going to be mastectomy and chemo-+herceptin but will get more details tomorrow.  She is constantly thinking deep dark thoughts and thinking the worst all the time. I don\u2019t know what else\u2019s to say / do to help her. I reassure and say it will be fine but with her mental state I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be as I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s going to get through this (she\u2019s 60) . Is this a normal reaction?? She won\u2019t talk to anyone in the same boat as her nor come on any forums like this? She hasn\u2019t really cried either?  I feel so so helpless and don\u2019t know what else to do? She\u2019s going to let this take over her life and it\u2019s having a massive effect on the rest of the family as there\u2019s a dark cloud looming all the time.  Has anyone else been / felt the same as my mum? Where do I go from here? She really needs some help even at this early stage as she is not coping at all.  Thank you in advance. ",
