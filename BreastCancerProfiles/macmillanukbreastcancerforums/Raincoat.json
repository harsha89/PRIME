      "Content": "I've just had my 17th Herceptin dose and have been told I can carry on receiving it beyond the normal one-year allocation.  I'm very pleased about this. As soon as I started it, I noticed quite immediate benefits. But for the last two months I've developed an outbreak of quite unpleasant, very itchy eczema in patches all over my body.  I've tried a variety of creams and am just about controlling it, but it's driving me slightly nuts, particularly at night.  I'm also swimming most days and am reluctant to give this up because it makes me feel great.  But I think the chlorine in the pool is aggravating my eczema. I have had eczema in the past from time to time; it tended to flare up at times of stress or when there was a significant change in my life.  But it's never been this bad or lasted so long.  Has anyone else on Herceptin experienced this?  The oncologist looked blankly at me when I asked if it could be a side effect.  However, the head of my hospice, a doctor and academic, says he is quite sure it's Herceptin-related.

      "Content": "...I wrote it too quickly because it's something that has been bothering me; I should have thought it through. I have no evidence about which type to use; something in the original post just resonated with me because I had real problems being convinced I smelt of sweat and chemo (yuk, sorry!) I suppose I just had quite a lot of broken skin and inflammation and felt purely on instinct that it would be better to use a spray from a distance. I'm definitely going to talk to the oncol about this at my next appointment. Does anyone know about any approved research on which deodorants cancer patients should use? I'd certainly be interested.",

I've just been using Dove Original spray (haven't sprayed for years, but something is telling me it's safer than roll-on...) Anyway, it does the trick and my armpit is looking less hideous every day Sending you my sympathies...",

      "Content": "So - looks like we're all on-message now; no strong evidence linking deodorants with cancer; our concerns relate more to instinctive distaste at over-chemicalising ourselves/the environment while remaining confident about our personal hygiene. I asked my oncologist about this. Her reply was that there are no solid medical guidelines. All she would recommend is selecting the mildest, least perfumed variety we can find that does the trick. She did mention the Simple range (neither I nor she has a vested financial interest; I checked!) But I know a lot of people don't find it adequate. So I just went off to Boots and found the mildest one I could and intend to work through the ranges until I find the right one for me. Sorry this is inconclusive; I suppose as I've discussed with a couple of you we just have to accept that having to re-examine such a basic issue as personal hygiene is another cross we have to bear... Anyway, I'm grateful to Dee for raising the matter and Seanty for providing links to the current state of research, particularly refuting the parabens hoax and the situation on aluminium. Past discussions do appear to have been slightly infused with people trying to flog stuff.",

      "Content": "Just to add to Dove's post, I was diagnosed with bone secondaries to primary bc one year ago. I too have received bisphosphonates (zoledronic, not your mum's one, but similar idea) every 3 weeks for the past year (only 15 mins infusion and no palpable side effects). I don't know if your mum was shown any of her scans, but just before last Christmas I saw a picture of my skeleton with HUGE black spots all over it; not nice viewing. My friend was with me (a doctor!) and he had real problems containing his horror... Last week, after an MRI, bone scan and x-ray, my oncol told me that my bone mets had appeared to have \"healed\" themselves! Not a retraction of my Stage IV diagnosis, but a huge psychological boost. I am increasingly convinced that fear is a very significant factor in this whole rollercoaster, and would suggest you tell your mum our stories, and not to be afraid. She is not an old lady: is she interested in swimming or mild physical exercise? I was one of these people who had a life-long aversion to the gym, but although I'm not saying exercise is any type of medical cure (I put that down to the infusions), it has made me feel much better on a general daily basis. Not that I've given up the fags or the booze! No such smugness...",

      "Content": "Dove: I've followed many of your posts with interest because our diagnoses are similar although you are an older hand than me. I have found your story and outlook very inspirational (overused word, but correct in this context) because of the length of time you have lived with this thing and how you have come to terms with it. I don't mind having been told unambiguously that this disease is \"incurable\" at our stage, but I really wish the medics had been clear at the outset just how manageable it is, and how long it is possible to lead a perfectly normal life with it. Of course since treatment, I've met scores of women who, like you, have been in the same boat as I am now for a decade and more. But for some months I had just assumed that I'd had my last birthday. Not an attitude that's going to help in any way. That's what is so great about this site, Kerry, it really does give a much broader perspective than a 3-weekly meeting in a depressing room with an oncologist. I hope you stick around here; there are lots of other stories like ours on the site and I do hope it can offer critical reassurance to your mum..and to you too.",

I had a bone scan 10 days ago (no results yet, needless to say) and in the last week have inexplicably fallen over three times! My knees are grazed and plastered like a child's, and of course I'm terrified of getting an infection and jeapordising the chemo. Is this familiar to anyone? I'm off alcohol so can't blame the gin....",

She's got me down for a swift brain scan and \"doesn't like the sound of it\". Also got confirmed mets in my bones today which may go some way to explaining it. It did all happen roughly 10 days into my chemo cycle which may be significant. So if it happens to you, GET ON THEIR CASE!! Catriona",

      "Content": "...but congratulations on having a successful pregnancy after chemo and rads - how wonderful! I also have secondary breast cancer in my bones (Stage iv). I am still having Herceptin after 8 chemos, and my personal treatment for the bone mets is zoledronic acid (by intravenous drip every 3 weeks) with calcium supplements, but of course your treatment is for your oncologist to decide. I just wanted to tell you, for what it's worth, that I have had no discernible bone problems at all over the past 7 months. Just before my diagnosis I had a very disconcerting \"jelly-like\" sensation in my hips, which I noticed when on holiday in a very hilly village in Spain. But after treatment began this sensation disappeared, and I've had no pain or restrictions on my mobility. Also, my latest scan has revealed that my bone hotspots have diminished significantly. I have not been working over the past 6 months, but this is due to my chemo brain (my work involves research and independent analysis and I'm not up to it) and exhaustion rather than any other physical disability. Socially, I've led a fairly normal life, and have been on holiday overseas a few times. At the moment I'm \"working the chemo out of my system\" and have been terribly tired, but my bloods and ct scan have been fine. Please feel free to pm if you want to chat, and all the very best Catriona xx",
