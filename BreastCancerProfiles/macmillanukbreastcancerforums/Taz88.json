    "Content": "Hi Baduki1 I was given same choices but I eventually decided to just have mastectomy. I still have the option of reconstruction later on whenever i want.  I didnt want reconstruction incase I somehow get area infected, as i wanted to avoid further surgeries etc. As im so scared of this! I just wanted everything to get done and over with.  It all depends on personal preferences. I dont regret my choice. And havent even tried the prosthetic yet lol. Maybe when i heal abit more ill give it a try.  Mastectomy to be honest isnt as bad as you expect. The recovery takes a few weeks but soon youll be back to normal. Im 5 weeks post surgery and i feel like i can di everythin i did before- apart from heavy lifting. Youll be fine. Whatever your gut says. Go with that xx ",
