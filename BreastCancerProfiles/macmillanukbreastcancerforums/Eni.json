I am also having pains around the breast area hence part of my worry thinking worst case senario. But why mention treatment plans when it could change? It's it a bit misleading? Thanks",

I am scared the lump could spread due to my nides due to time I have to wait  I am also concerned that I still have to wait for another 2 weeks to get results after the surgery . Why another agonising wait. Does it mean that initial result could change? I am so worried. Does anyone have a similar experience?",
