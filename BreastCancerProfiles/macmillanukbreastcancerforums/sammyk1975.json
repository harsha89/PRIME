      "Content": "Hi There and Im sure your all going to feel that im selfish but i dont want to be, there is so many times you can cry on a friends shoulder and I know they dont mind, but I mind, feel like im a depressive and im not usually!!! But 2 days ago my sister was told her breast cancer has gone to her liver and behind her breast wall so far she has had 5 chemos and now, depending on her blood results she could be up for a phase 2 trail at the royal Marsedn sutton branch, but I have lost all faith, nothing has worked so far and im shitting it, I lost her to this disease 2 years ago and i might, more than likely will lose her to this. We arent like normal sisters and families I know since I have been young we have always been close, went out clubbing when we were young and she is my best friend, dont get me worng we have had our rows but we have always forgiven each other and had and big hug and a glass of wine and dance round the kitchen, I look around many of my friends and they arent as close as us and never have been. Im single so my sister is my backbone, she is married and has twins and basically the doctors have said they could try to extend her life, depends on what her bloods turn out. I cant tell you how much im shitting myself, its all new so im just crying and I cant cry especially in front of her. I expectm y parent to die before me (and that is a horrible thought) but not my sister, MY SISTER, who I thought I would grow old with. Albeit she has twins what happens when he meets someone else, which, he will, I always want to be part of their kids life and keep my sisters soul alive . Im just one scared sister who hasnt stopped crying since i have heard this shity news and NO i wont get upset infront of my sister as I intend to spend every minute that I can with her LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART, a piece of me will go with her. Just feeling lostat the moment and dont know where to turn so came here ....sorry if I have upset anyone. Good luck with your journey x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Michele Thanks for replying and today if any day that I needed support was the one I needed it. I went to my sisters yesterday for a big family meal and we were tallking all horrible stuff like puttting her clothes and jewellery away for the kids and it was just heartbreaking. so this morning I woke up and just haven't stopped crying, had to go into town as im on holiday on thursday (which im dreading as think I will be a wreck) to get some bits and bumped into a friend who had heard that shes terminal and just broke down in the middle of Marks and Bloody Spencers. It all seems so real now and I know there is hope but she has had such bad luck that im starting to think about life without Lou and everytime I do I break, she is a massive part of me, speak to her everyday and she is the person I go to when Im upset, happy, have a joke to tell, found a new pair of shoes etc.... and I just cant think about facing the future without her, Im just so scared I cant sleep cant eat, just cry. Im sorry to harp on just having a real emotional day - Thanks again xxxx",

      "Content": "I have been watching this thread since it started and completely agree with you all and go for it Girls!! I haven't lost my breast or have cancer but im on this site as my sister has been fighting breast cancer for 2 years now and on her 5th Chemo and god knows how many ops and I know she wouldn't agree with the Mel B campaign! Christ she showed me her op after her breast was removed before she showed her husband, which took her at least a month to show him as she didn't feel womanly at all. I cant imagine how you all feel, all I know is how she feels and I hope you dont think I am wrong in joining in this as im not where you are but someone i love is and i am right behind her and you all. Will be uploading this thread to my facebook and the mel B Advert. So many other people that could of been promoting this from celebs that have had it to people living a every day life having it!! Good luck xxx",

      "Content": "Sorry sassy 71, but I disagree seeing a picture of Mel b with her bloke covering her bits doesn't make me think 'oh i ned to check my breasts' seeing a picture with someone with a boob removed would make me think I need to check, its just a celeb endorsing something that they ahve made money out of|!",
