    "Content": "I finished two years on Letrozole in April of this year.   I suffered from really bad side effects for the first three months, and tried three different generic brands, all of which made my side effects, particularly joint pains, progressively worse.   I read several posts on another forum from women who had found that their side effects improved when they were switched to Femara rather than a generic brand, and spoke to my GP.  She agreed to let me try Femara, and it reduced the side effects by an incredible amount, to the extent where I could walk properly again, and could get out of bed easily in the morning.   Femara is much more expensive than the generic brands, but it really did make a huge difference to me, and my GP was willing to fund the extra cost.   My side effects did gradually build up again over the rest of the two years but were never as bad as with generic brands.  When I switched to tamoxifen, all of my side effects disappeared within a couple of days.  Although I am starting to get joint pains again and horrendous flushes, I'm finding tamoxifen far easier to tolerate than letrozole, and if my side effects continue to get worse, I'll try changing brands.   But whatever the side effects, I feel it's a very small price to pay for reducing my risk of a recurrence.  Enter your message...",
