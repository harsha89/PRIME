    "Content": "Hi, this is my first post, so I had a mastecomy and reconstruction 2 weeks ago, all went well, my lymph nodes came back clear, which I hope to take as a positive I've been super positive since finding out, having 2 young children and being very young to be hit with this, but the last 2 days it had really started to hit me, especially when a cancer advert comes on the telly! I am getting really stressed and worried about my results, which were meant to be this Thursday, but I got a phone call this morning, saying a machine in the lab has broken down, and now I have to wait til next Thursday,Â are they having a laugh?! Trying to keep distracted, but I'm finding it very difficult. How has everyone coped with the waiting game? Many thanks.",
