      "Content": "Hi ladies.  I too am suffering with awful aches in my muscles. I am now 17 days post final docetaxel. I am also very very breathless. I mentioned all this at pre chemo 6 review and ended up admitted for 4 nights for suspected pulmonary embolism. I never had one thankfully but was given no explanation for these effects. I am starting to feel really down now as I have no energy to do anything and if I try then am floored with the breathlessness and aching muscles. Anyone know how long I can expect to feel like this?? ",

      "Content": "Hi both. I had the same op 2 weeks ago. Make sure mum has good pain relief and some laxatives as the pain killers can cause constipation. I purchased a memory foam v pillow from argos which has helped me get comfortable. My friend cooked up lots of meals to freeze for me. Another bought me wipes to make cleaning easier when I feel up to it. Mum needs to just rest up. I am now starting to feel a little better with the right pain relief and I also needed antibiotics as had an infection.  The op itself was fine. Coming home with a drain in was a bit uncomfortable but only for a few days. It doesn't hurt when they take it out. Hope all goes well. Use the sight and all the good people on here will support you all the way x",

I don't know how I am getting through this time of fear and uncertainty. My whole outlook on life has changed overnight. Had a real melt down yesterday. Have gone with the attitude that whatever they need to do to save my life then bring it on. I recognise that this is how my brain is coping with the shock but last night I became frightened of facing surgeries and hair loss etc. Currently have some propanalol and diazepam to help. Have been really careful with the diazepam but don't want to sink into a depression cause I need to focus. This site and you wonderful people are helping to get me through these dark hours.

Once you know your treatment plan, things wont seem so frightening. The waiting in the early stages for various results and info was for me the worst time.

      "Content": "Hi. I also had fec-t. My fingernails became very sensitive and painful but thankfully I haven't lost any. I also seem to be growing ridges on them now but still all intact. Chemo finished end of January so I am hoping they stay put. I never used any nail polish but wore gloves for any washing up or cleaning jobs. Good luck Gina x",

      "Content": "Hi all. Well, no wonder I have been in so much pain! Went to the seroma clinic yesterday and had it drained. This doesn't hurt at all for anyone worrying about having it done. My wound is infected despite being on antibiotics, had a reaction to the steri strips and also have cording. This explains the pain and discomfort. I have to go back on Friday as by then this course of tablets will be finished and I may need another course.  When I started to massage the cording the tears finally flowed. I felt really sad and sorry for myself and wondered why it's not enough to go through the surgery? All these extras are what I didn't prepare for.  Felt better after a good cry and a large dose of self pity. Today I will plod along knowing why I feel so sore and will stop trying to hurry up the recovery. Keep smiling guys xx",

      "Content": "Hi Siggers yes it was Sept we started out on the chemo. I have my rads planning next week and picc line out. I am assuming 15 sessions will start the week after. I too have an appointment in September to start the reconstruction journey and then this will finally be done apart from the tamoxifen.  Somebody asked about T. Mine always ran for an hour followed by a 5 minute saline flush.  Am still weary in body and that is getting me down. I think I was that pleased that the final chemo was done that I was forgetting it now needs to do its thing around my body I am feeling tingly around the fingers and toes. So far all still there but as I had almost every side effect at one time or another I doubt I will escape this one. I never chose to be part of this elite group but I am proud to be one of you. Whenever I have felt alone and frightened I have come on here and instantly got whatever support I have needed. I hope I have been able to give a bit back and I shall continue to do so xxx",

      "Content": "Well I did it. Survived fec-t and all it threw at me. I am left looking very different to when it started... Bald fat n a front tooth missing. Yes tooth!  I hadn't read about effects on the teeth but apparently it happens. Can't risk the dentist for a couple of weeks so I have to put up with looking like a candidate for the Jeremy Kyle show. The weight gain has really got to me. I just want to find some energy now to get my body moving again. Am day 9 last T. Can't walk up the stairs without feeling breathless and exhausted at the minute.  I have my rads planning meeting next week. The final stage before reconstruction. I get to go on Tamoxifen too. Oh the joys.  I am now very positive in my head.  It's nearly over. I did it. I am a little scathed and certainly not the same person I was pre BC. I have learned who I can rely on and who I can't.  I think it is hard for people to understand how we feel if they haven't walked the walk. That's why these forums are so important. Ramble over xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jj I totally get where you are coming from. I somehow got through all the treatment and the joys that went with it.  I have started back on a phased return to work, and have never felt so low. My anxiety has returned big time too. Everyone says how well I look, how my ridiculous hair suits me. They can't see what's going on inside. The racing heart, the emotions never far away.  I am finally allowing myself to actually think about what has happened to me and it's horrible.  I have self referred through work for some counselling. I recognise that I need to deal with it. The Dr has given me beta blockers for the anxiety.  How we are feeling is normal. I have read so many accounts of others feeling the same. We are changed, inside and out. But we did it. We got through it,  and we will get through this too. Lots of hugs to you xxx",

Initially I refused to be concerned about how I will look. Well its creeping in now with a vengeance. The question of lymph nodes having it in, has it spread??? My heart is constantly racing despite propanolol. I can't stay still, can't relax. Sleep??? Yeah right that's not good either. Am so so lucky in how much support I have. I can't let them know how terrified I really am. Major meltdown going on. I seem to get them every 2 or 3 days. Am keeping busy but then its just me and my thoughts. The waiting is a nightmare in itself. Needed to put this down. Feeling majorly sorry for myself right now x",

I do have a couple of friends who I can talk to honestly so maybe it's time I did. I just feel so out of control and I am the type of person who needs to have some control if that makes sense? I know that things will speed up soon and what feels like an eternity will pass. The hardest thing for me at the moment is watching my daughter trying to be so brave. It's her birthday next week she will be 19. So want her to enjoy it and have some time away from all this. I feel a bit better today and that's largely down to the support of you guys so I thank you muchly xx",

      "Content": "Fifi I am not having immediate reconstruction as the surgeon suggested I wait as radiotherapy is highly likely and she said it would be better to get the treatment and heal first. I was and am ok with that and I  too have a fantastic partner who wants me to have a life rather than a boob. I guess once it all sunk in the reality came through. Little things like having to get different tops and stuff. I know that it will all be worth it to have my life and health. I already feel like a different person. Am not frightened of the op itself....yet.  I think I try to stay strong because I worry that people will get sick of hearing about it. I am a talker and it's how I deal with things. That's what's so helpful about this site cause I can come on here and let it out.  Wishing all you good people well x",
