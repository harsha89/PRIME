      "Content": "Hi sasha I think its good to get a second opinion and your oncologist sounds like he should give up medicine and try a profession where bedside manner doesnt matter.... Anyway what i was going to say was the side effects you get from the treatments vary however the main thingtha happens to everybody is hair loss... This starts around two weeks after your first dose of chemo and its the E epirubicin which causes this... It is red and given through a cannula or longerterm device such as a picc or hickman line. The F is 5 Flourouricil which tbh doesnt really do much and the C is cyclophosphamide which can cause bladder irritation so think you might need to be a bit wary of it... The E also makes you pee pink for a day... If your drink lots of water before and after the chemo it helps flush it through your body. Paclitaxel is also sometimes called taxol... And it is given weekly this means its not so much all at one go so your kidney should hopefully be ok with it.... FEC tends to cause nausea and vomitting more than taxol, but not everybody gets sick.... Other common side effects can be feeling tired, sore mouth, ulcers, funny taste, constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, garstric reflux, gritty eyes, watering eyes, and risk of infections due to low blood count. I think its probably wise to have chemo so long as its not going to cause serious damage to your kidney.... So yb you can ask to be referred to a renal consultant to discuss it with him too... But if the kidney problem is not life threatening then i think having the chemo is def worth considering as the cancer is life threatening if left untreated. you will get a bigger benefit from chemo the worse the prognosis is.... But as its lobularou houkd get quite. Good effects from hormone therapy too which starts after chemo has finished.... Best of luck.",

Some malignant calcs have a specific look and your may not be showing that hence the reason they are willing to recheck you in six months..... Many people feel that we over treat DCIS and maybe your doc is of this opinion.... However if it was me I think I'd want to know one way or the other now and not be worrying for six months.... However if the calcs are DCIS this is pre invasive and can't spread anywhere else and it's pretty slow growing normally..... I would say if he's calling you back in six months he's not overly concerned... But at the same time I really do think they should be able to give you an answer now.

Not everybody referred will be suitable for testing..... Only 20% of those tested will be positive for a gene.... If your cancer is triple negative and you are under 40 or you have strong family history they can sometimes do a fast track gene test if you are contemplating bilateral mastectomy. Otherwise it's routine.... The fast track can be one itching two weeks, but mostly it takes about 4 months for the full gene analysis.... This is where no gene change is known in your family..... The predictive test they can do if somebody else is known to have a gene test and only takes about a month..... You will be fully counselled normally before they will test you... First they will want check your family history and get confirmation of the types and age of onset of the cancers.... Then you will get an explanation of you what the results could mean.... You dont have to be tested if you dont want to even if you fit the criteria not everybody wants to know. I have a brca2 gene mutation which was identified after I had a second breast cancer at 40 after the original one at 37 and have just completed chemo for a recurrence at 43... I work in breast cancer genetics so if you need any help let me know.",

Was at optician today and still dry. i use hypromellose eye drops and ave used carbomer in the past and she recommended i get sime if them again too... Also said eating anti oxidants like berries are good for eyes and brazil nuts which are high in selenium help dryness.... Don think they have much thy can do to stop the watering.... She also said that eyes start deteriorating from 40 so in my case its likely to be a combination of both age and chemo. also suffer from the scabby nose and post-nasal drip since docetaxel and carboplatin which. Finished 6 months ago but nose has never been quite right since chemo in 2009..... Also have naseptin, which is good, abd also use vaseline and nasonex nasal spray. Which has helped the choking which i got from the Post nasal drip. also have dry mouth since starting tamoxifen in 2006 and use biotene oral balance saliva replacement gel, mouth still not quite right as it was destroyed by the docetaxel, but the gel tastes nice and does help. hope you all can get something to help",

Not everybody's periods stop on tamoxifen and for some people it can cause bleeding problems.... I had to get a gynae consult and have a biopsy and D and C.... All was ok but as there is a link with endometrial cancer they like to check these things out.... The link is for older women who have been on tamoxifen for longer than 5 years but the prefer to err on the side of caution with these things normally. I also to a mirena coil fitted when they were doing the D and C and this pretty much stopped my periods completely after the intitial few weeks of spotting...

Many units do not do immediate recons if there is a chance you may need radiotherapy.... Also frequently if you need chemo they will only offer delayed recon too as they want you to heal quickly and there is often a longer recover and a higher chance of problems following recon than following mastectomy.....

Bilateral cancer is pretty rare but I was found to be carrying a brca 2 gene mutation. I remember back to those early days when I was first diagnosed and all you know is that you have cancer but you have no idea how bad it is... My mind was working over time and just thought the worst. Strangely not knowing I had cancer was worse than knowing I did..... Once you know what your dealing with then you can make plans.

Its possible thereis a small focus of infiltration seen on your mastectomy pathology.... Snb are not routinely carried out on women with dcis so it coud be that your team thought it was very likely to contain invasive cancer as well. As for the rads themselves they can cause damage to implants like encapsulation and hardening and may mean your require further surgery at a later stage to resolve this.... But even with invasive cancer rads are not routine following matectomy so its perhaps that the area affected was very large or the the cancer was very close to the muscle or there were some invasive or preinvasive cancer cells in the margin.... If they are offering it then its usually means its recommended in your situation as they generally wouldnt put you through it if they didnt think it was important for you to have it.... Good luck.",

This doesnt mean it will def be cancer it could well be just benign calcs and that is what they are trying to find out. If it is a recurrence of the cancer then it can still be treated.... I know a recurrence is every breast cancer patients worst fear but a recurrence doesnt mean its spread it means she would prob need more surgery but often that would be all....

Didn't have any heartburn for the first three years until I had Chemo and this started the problem nd after I finished Chemo and went back on tamox it didn't resolve.... I take omeprazole, which helps.... I'm back on Chemo and off tamox again but need a higher dose when on Chemo as it feels like a really hard stone pressing in my chest, and can't sleep lying down... Think I have about 6 pillows at the mo. I also have a sensitivity to ibuprofen which causes me to get a stomach ulcer so not sure if I'm just uber sensitive to gastric problems.... I haven't taken brufen for 4 years now and the stomach eating itself feeling doesn happen any more. Hope you get some relief from the ranitidine but if that doesn't help either do ask your gp for something like omeprazole or lasoprazole to see if that would be suitable for you. Take care Lulu",

      "Content": "Hi Elaine you are obviously very worried however a red swollen breast is rarely a sign of recurrence.... Only really if you had a type of breast cancer called inflammatory BC which isnt very common in the first place...... Redness and swelling are much more likely to be infection although you can also get lymphoedema in your breast as well as your arm or hand..... A painful lump in your breast is less likely to be cancer than say something benign like a cyst or fibroadenoma.... Its wise to get it checked out and glad our GP has organised an urgent scan.... You didnt say what grade the tumour was but likely to be grade 1 or 2 if no chemo.... So extremely unlikely for a grade 1 or 2 tumour to grow to plum size in such a short space of time... In fact even a grade 3 tumour would normally take much longer to develop into a tumour the size of a plum which is about 4cm.... No scan is 100% so there is a slight chance it may be a cancer which has been there longer and not picked up on mammo or US but again this is unlikely, although not impossible. I would say from what you have said its much less likely to be a recurrence or even a new cancer and more likely to be something benign.... Fingers crossed the ABs work and help put your mind at rest a bit before your scan..... If it is a recurrence or new cancer we are all here for you and you will get through it too. I have had a new primary and a recurrence and still got a very good prognosis just means we have to have more treatment but you get there in the end sweetie.... And as my friend said recently stop consulting Dr Google... Hes no good! Take care.",

The main hairloss happens around the two week mark and a lot of people think the cold cap isn't working but it's maybe worthwhile trying it again next cycle as its very likely you will lose some but not all and when it falls out t always looks more in your hand than it does on your head for some reason. If you decide the cold cap isn't for you then there are lots of options like wigs, scarves, hats, bandanas etc. Iv had chemo twice but never used the cold cap and the first time around my head was extremely painful from about day 14 and my hair started falling out the next day and shaved it all off on day 17. The second time again my head got quite sore but this time from day 10 and my hair started coming out on day 12. I didn't shave it this time just cut it very short and it looks like bumfluff (baby monkey hair or duck down). I wear a wig sometimes but often just go bare headed. The pain I felt wasn't like a burning sensation was more of stabbing forks into my head..... It lasted for a few days and some headaches but then subsided.... Try some pain killers to see if that helps. With respect of the cold cap stopping chemo from working this is not entirely true and has been researched many times... it can cause less chemo to get to the skull but bone mets in the skull are extremely rare, but it doesn't cause less chemo to get to the brain or anywhere else in the body.

      "Content": "Hi flower.... Meant to say I'm from scotland too...... From Edinburgh. Some units will perform scans routinely when diagnosed with an invasive tumour.... Sometimes when the tumour is bigger or multi focal or when it's the nodes they will do a liver CT, bone scans and chest X-ray.... I'm presuming because yours is multifocal they are doing the scans. As long as the cancer isn't in another organ it is still cureable but they cannot tell who and who isn't cured until you survive for 40 years and die from old age.... Even if it is in another organ it is still treatable too but they don't tend to use the cured word unless you have what's called a triple negative tumour which your isn't.... On average 90% of women will be alive in 10 year or longer... Most people are cured. Unfortunately until ou have all the answers you will still be worried but I do think that maybe you are suffering bit more than normal so you might benefit from counselling or maybe even antidepressants... Although they take about 2-3 weeks to start working.... Might be worth chatting to your gp. As for the baby situation.... You are only 37.... There's no reason why you cannot have another baby after this... And there is a new document issued by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists last year supporting women conceiving after cancer.... As a midwife the biggest increase in childbearing is in women 40 and over.... Don't write your life off until you have all the facts. Take care Lulu xxx",

      "Content": "Hi flower Multifocal means theres two or more tumours within the same area of the breast... Usually they are all the same and associated with each other... Often with dcis in-between. Grade 2 isn't the highest but not the lowest grade either.... Grades relate to aggressiveness abd how fast the cells are changing so from your results yours is somewhere in the middle although can sometimes change after surgery and they examine the whole tumour..... T1 and Stage 1 means that the cancer is confined to the breast, 2cm or smaller and there doesn't appear to be any node involvement.... Again this occasionally changes after the full path results as it can sometimes be bigger once removed than on imaging. ER 7/8 is strongly hormone receptive so is likely to respond very well to hormone treatment like tamoxifen or aramotase inhibitors which you would normally take for 5 years. In some places surgeons are happy to do WLE if you have two small tumours even if a little bit away from each other but some will only do an mx if you have more than one area. If you have three or more they will pretty much do an mx wherever you are in the country. good luck Lulu xx Just re-read that they told you it appeared to be only DCIS at first look sorry if I have scared you about it being invasive but it is still early.... If it's stage 1 or even stage 2 or 3 that is still classed as early breast cancer and treatable and curable. Lulu x",

They will want to know the type of cancer and the grade and how receptive it is to hormones. Normally if it's a low grade tumour you won't need chemo but if it's a high grade then it's much more likely... If its positive for her2 receptors chemos also more likely and if you have positive nodes then you normally get chemo... The one standard thingies everybody has surgery but sometimes it's done soon after diagnosis bit in other cases you have chemo first then surgery. Mastectomy is done if its a large tumour or lots of small tumours. Lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy is the normal treatment.

Even though mum was fine I was worried that me being younger would be worse and spent a lot of time reflecting on my life as at the first appointment you just don't know how serious it is.... I had a fine needle aspiration the day of my clinic appt and they were able to tell me it was def cancer just not the finer details until the full path results came back the next week. Id been told they were gonna throw the works at me because I was young but turned out to be a grade 1 BC so didn't need Chemo... Only needed a lumpectomy as the invasive component was small.... 13mm. did have to get a reexcision as didn't get clear margins due to high grade dcis so had another wee op and got a wee bit more shaved off.. The whole thing including dcis was 25mm but didn't need an mx even though small breast 34b... Often depends on your surgeons capabilities and confidence. It is really scary at the start of the journey but it does get a but easier along the way.... I have lost good friends to BC too along the way but doesn't mean that will happen to me too... Although have a gene mutation and had BC three times now so it does make you wonder a bit but it's all still confined locally so far. Treatment isn't fun but you get through it....

I felt a bit sick after the epi and had bad taste... Had quite a bit of energy on chemo day and would go shopping on he way back from treatment.... Had a curry the next night but couldn't eat curry on cmf as got sore mouth and ulcers but not on epi..... It's hard to remember the side effects now as they do fade with time.... Just remember feeling generally crap and tired...... Hope its going ok for you both.... lulu x",

Bit like forks being stabbed in my head.... It started growing back in on cmf though..... I was off on sick leave for 10 months after diagnosis.... Partly because I worked 50miles away and couldn't face the commute and partly cos I felt completely poop with chemo brain and no concentration..... I had the indigestion too and was given omeprazole from the chemo unit.... And also ad very watey gritty eyes it's cursed by dry eyes and was given hypromellose eye drops from the chmo unit... Both these problems persisted long after chemo ended..... I had pains in my face and head while getting the cyclophosphamide infusion the C of CMF..... it's fairly common to get a tickly nose but my experience was. Bit extreme but can happen also had a massive sneezing fit.... But this all only lasted for about 20 mins thn went back o normal..... Also on the hair issue.... Lost all my nose hairs and ended up with an alternating crusty or runny nose.... Eyelashes all fell out after I started cmf.... Didn't lose all my eyebrows and had to shave my legs throughout treatment!!! Lulu",

      "Content": "Hi VJ I'm also treated in Edinburgh..... I had a wle but had to have a further revision for unclear margins in 2006. My tumour was smaller was only 1.5cm but there was lots of DCIS making it about 3cm.... I also had a wle in the other side in 2009 when I got another tumour it was also about 3cm including DCIS of which 2cm was invasive..... I have quite small breast B cup but they pretty good..... If you have larger breasts and the tumour is near the edge then they can often take a bigger tumour without making your breast look odd... If removing a rumour makes you uneven they can do a reduction on the ther side too.... Good luck with your op hope all goes well on fri.",

Is it a lip/facial thing or do you mean to your breast following treatment? If it's lipofill or fat transfer to your breast then you would normally need to wait at least 6-12 months after radiotherapy as the rads can make the tissue shrink more over the next 12 months or longer. If it's a facial thing then I think it's probably fine to have it unless your on treatment which it may interfere with but your doc should be able to advise you on that. Lulu x",

      "Content": "Hi Kaz I was diagnosed with breast cancer for the 3rd time last august and currently under going Chemo too. I know when I got it for the second time that was the worst experience of the three.... I think because every bodies biggest fear is getting cancer again and when it actually happens it's such a shock and so traumatic..... When I got it the 3rd time it wasn't such a horrific shock and just kinda felt here we go again. If your not happy with your reconstruction why not arrange to see your surgeon to let him check it out and see if there is anything else they can do to improve things.... Often reconstruction is not just one operation but a process of operations.... If your due radiotherapy they probably wouldn't want to do anything until around 6-12 months after that. Also many breast units have counsellors and psychologists and it might be helpful to discuss your fears with somebody neutral.... I found it very helpful to talk things over and also had a course if anti depressants which help me through those very very dark days. Take care Lulu x",

Or at least a cancer nurse specialist even if she covers more cancers than just breast alone. Its tough going though this but you do kinda need that person to explain what the onc meant or find information from etc.... You can maybe use the helpline number to get some advice from the mac nurses xxxx irene hope you didnt get any elephants stuck in your teeth! Lol!

      "Content": "Hi sasha..... They can change the hormonal or herceptin status in a couple of ways.... One is that is could be on the borderline betweeen the two... For example with HER2 a score of 0 or 1 is neg and a score of 3 is positive but if its a two it requires further testing usually called a fish test.... I think that if its over 2 its generally positive and under 2 is usually negative... So 2.1 is positive and 1.9 is neg.... It could be that there is a tiny bit more or a tiny bit less of that protien wehn they test it again..... Also similar for hormones that it could be on the borderline.... Some oncs treat 3/8 as neg where as some treat it as positive... It is positive but a very low positive score... However may still benefit from hormonal treatment...... the other way it can change is because its a a sneaky wee bugger and can get used to the treatment... So if you are taking hormones it can built up resistance a bit like infections do to antibiotics..... So for years it could be kept under control by the treatment you have had and then after many attempts figures out that if it drops the hormones it might be able to grow a bit more. you can also get a new unrelated cancer so you can have two primary breast tumours one that might be hormone positive and one might be hormone negative.... This is what happened to me.... My first BC was grade 1 ER pos 7/8 and second was in the other breast three years later and was grade 3 Triple neg for ER, PR and HER2. So it hadnt changed they were two different cancers.... Hope that helps.",
