I intend going back to work beginning of March phased return also using annual leave. I think you need to give yourself sometime after treatment finishes to recover physically and mentally. ",

      "Content": "Hey Lynnwad,  First one today at 9, nerves are kicking in now !! I think I am ready nails painted, hair coloured bag packed  etc...  It's going to be a long journey, but at least we are on the road to recovery. Yes what a difference a year makes, not a brilliant 50th birthday present, things could be worse..Good luck be strong ❤️  The first eviction notice is being given to our squatters, let's get rid.  I will take a look at the juicer, what a good price !  It's hard to imagine feeling ill, when you feel so well, hey we may sail through it who knows.  Keep smiling.  Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynnwad,  What a relief FIRST one done ! I was ok a lot better than I expected, sorry to hear you had a panic attack but it is quite understandable especially with MRI as well. I Felt nauseous, light headed with a headache a couple of hours after and then through the night and a little now. Maybe lack of caffeine as I don't fancy my beloved cup of tea. I found the cold cap ok, I think the chin strap was the worst !! Hamster cheeks came to mind lol.  Hope you are feeling ok today ? we will have a chill day today, and tell ourselves how brave we are and enjoy being spoiled by our loved ones.  Skye01 if I haven't missed you the chemo infusion is fine and so is the cold cap, the nurses were also brilliant.  Sugar65 ",
