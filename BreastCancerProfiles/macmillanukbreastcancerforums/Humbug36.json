    "Content": "Hi Nicky,  My bcn gave me a bra and I was able to purchase another from them. Very secure, the bras I used were in S, M,,L. I wear a 32d and needed a medium.  When I was able to raise my arms I used a good sports bra and changed between these. I had expander so needed a flexible bra, once I got to my max inflation and over expanded I went to m&s and got some non wired pretty bras. I love Victoria's secrets bras and hated the ugly ones I had to wear in beginning but m&s had really ones and matching pant sets. I really hope that all goes well and if u have any questions feel free to ask.  Xx",
