      "Content": "Hi Yvonne Sorry you are feeling so sore, I was told when I had my Operation on 11/3/14 to make sure I was not in pain after the operation.  I was taking paracetamol 1mg & iberbrofen 600, every 8 hours.  Have you checked with your CN who should help you to control the pain.  It is important for you to be PAIN FREE. Have a look at your scars, the sooner the better, they are probably not as bad as you thought, mine weren't. It does get better I promise.... been there got the t-shirt. I have been very fortunate that my friends here in Spain have been so supportive, my Husband has been marvellous.  I find it is great being a supervisor...he now knows how the washer & iron works.  It helps him to cope with what is happening to me. I can cope until I get the sympathy looks & \"I am so sorry\"  wow that really brings the tears.  Worse thing for me was when I had to tell my son who was serving in Afghanistan.  I saw his Facebook & he said of all the things he had had to endure hearing I had Breast Cancer was the worst day of his life. The Army sent him back early & I was able to see him the week after my op that was a great boost. I go to see Oncologist on Friday 25th to find out what Radiotherapy & Hormone Treatment.  Not looking forward to any of it but it has to be done to ensure I am Cancer free & able to lead a long & happy life. Keep your chin up you are not alone. Lots of love",

      "Content": "Hi Yvonne You need to step back & let others do things for you it is not easy but unless you take it easy you will not feel good about yourself.  Your body has been through a major trauma, is telling you to relax & let it heal. I am 6 weeks post lump op & only now feeling something like myself, for the moment, it feels good. I do know I have got to ask for help & stop trying to do everything myself. So what if the house need dusting, your health is more important. I am going on 5th May to get results of Genes Test to see what Hormone & radiotherapy I will need.  Not looking forward to this but I know this is something I need to do to get healthy again.  As I was told by a lovely friend, by letting someone help you, you are giving them the gift of allowing them to show their love & concern for you. You have never stopped being YOU this is just a glitch that will pass, do something nice for yourself, a new pair of shoes does it for me!!! Take care of yourself, get plenty of rest & do not overdo it. Lots of love Patxx",

      "Content": "I live in Spain & found my BC because the lump was painful, mammogram just confirmed it was malignant. I needed a lumpectomy & some very skilled Surgeons saved my nipple. Have just completed 11 days of 21 Radiotherapy & will have 5 years on Letrozol.  Thankfully I did not need Chemo. I had a Mammaprint test on the tumour which individualised my treatment. I am coping very well with the Radiotherapy at the moment, not as bad as I thought it would be.  I have been prescribed different creams, one for the Radiotherapy & one for the redness & itching, both are working very well. All seems well except when I read the posts on this website & feel I have been extremely fortunate/lucky what ever the expression is.  I wonder why I have been so fortunate with treatment & results.  I know it is irrelevant & I should be thankful, which I am, just these stupid thoughts go through my head.  It was good to read I am not the only one. Thank you all Pat",
