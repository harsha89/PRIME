      "Content": "Hi ladies. I was wondering if anyone had DIEP (delayed) and how recovery was? How long until you could do work from home? Were you happy with your results? It's getting close to my op, they've said September, and I will be having it done at Royal Marsden Chelsea, by an amazing surgeon, hence I have had to wait an eternity. I feel very nervous though and sometimes I ask myself if it's worth putting myself through so much again! Caroline x",

I have been super annoyed the whole way through having this extra time added on to treatment, I am aware that I am lucky to have it but envy those who didn't. How did everyone else feel at the end of active treatment? Caroline x",

      "Content": "Hi Gill.  Sorry to hear about your dx.  I thought I'd give you a bit of suppprt as I'm a year on from chemo now. Firstly  chemo is administered through a cannula. It doesn't hurt too much but if you don't like needles make it clear you want a picc line. They fit one in top of your arm and then you don't have to worry about cannula. I didn't have one so can't give you much advice but if you search picc line on the Macmillan website it'll tell you more. Cold cap is not pleasant but worth trying   I tried it and lost all my hair and it wasn't that bad. I embraced it in the end everyone thinks it's the worst part of chemo in the beginning but for most it doesn't phase you too much. I wish you well and it goes so quickly you will soon be where I am wondering where that last year went. Caroline x",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis, on New Years Eve of all nights. I had FEC-T in July 2013. It is bearable. Generally people tolerate one chemo better than the other. I found FEC tough. It made me feel spaced out and out of it. T was bearable I just ached all over my body, but by the 3rd I had no side effects at all and it was a breeze. I didn't have triple negative cancer, but it seems that chemo works very well on triple neg cancers and now you have a treatment plan you should start feeling a little more in control. 18 months on, the key things I would tell others is to have as much support as possible. Don't be too proud to ask for help, oh and hope. Hope is what kept me going. Good luck with it, you can do it. x",
