    "Content": "hi  anybody have any ideas or tips on herbal remedies safe to take with tamoxifen. I was on Prozac previously to taking tamoxifen and after 18 months on Tamoxifen i asked to stop Prozac as i had researched its negative effect on tamoxifen treatment. ( yes I researched this not any of the medical experts) . Well my menopausal and tamoxifen symptoms have now increased dramatically and I am really struggling to cope.    Helen",
