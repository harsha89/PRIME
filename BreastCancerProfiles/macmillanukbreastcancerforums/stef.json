      "Content": "Hi Nollie I had the same op 27th April this year - the ball feeling under your arm pit is fluid dont worry when you see consultant usually 1 week after op she will check it and if necessary will drain it - i was drained 1wk after op it is not painful as that area is quite numb anyway.  Arm movement will depend on you doing the exercises regularly - i had difficulty raising my arm up and back it wouldn go as far as other arm - went to physio they say lie on floor and using your good arm to support the bad one by clasping hand or wrist try and get your arms above head and to touch the floor behind your head - also using the door frame put your hands on the door frame either side and do gentle press up moving body forwards feet kept still - your hands should be at head height - this may be too soon for you may be next week.   As for the horses i used to work at stables and wouldnt recomment mucking out or riding for a long while - i have a springer spaniel and it aches my arm now if i hold him in bad arm as he pulls on lead, but can use my arm just like the other with everyday stuff.  The pain after my op lasted a few weeks and eased off week by week.   The main pain came from the drain site under my arm pit abou 4 inches down - the lumpectomy scar didnt cause any pain at all but the lymph node scar was tender - you can massage the scars with creams and it will lessen the mark of the scar.  I met one of the ladies of the breast cancer site today as we were havin radiotherapy at the same time and same hospital - was lovely to see her after being on macsite chatting since april/may - hope this helps x stef",

      "Content": "Hi Bev  - hope you dont mind me popping on - i have been on breast cancer site since last April when i was diagnosed and reading this forum is very familiar - i met some great friends on our forum and even met up at christie hospital with one of them and met every day throughout our radiotherapy.  Also meeting up with two of the ladies on 26th feb for a girly weekend - i am from Manchester, one lady from Isle of Wight and other from stafford - we all meeting at the lady in staffords house after speaking online for nearly a year.  Can really relate to all of you and your experiences throughout FEC - i had 8 FEC and after about 3 lots realised that the steroids made me eat like a horse then when stopped them went into mega depression and tearful - thereafter i played around with them - once i tried no steroids and felt more sickly but at least my head was not affected as much then tried taking just half the dosage and that also helped - its the drop from taking steroids to non that makes you feel messed up.  Sam sorry about you losing your little dog - my dog of 9yrs passed away 2 days after my first FEC and just as the steroids wore off and i went down with a bang - couldnt stop crying and within 2 days went and bought an english springer spaniel called him Trevor lol.  Though this was a crazy thing to do as was absolutely shattered and cleaning up piddle constantly - it certainly took my mind off losing hair.  Hope you coping ok. x stef  ",
