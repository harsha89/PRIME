The 4th session was the most uncomfortable as my hair had thinned, Within 5/10 mins of the cap coming off I was fine no headaches. If your hair thins you can cover the thinner parts with gauze or ask if you can have a surgeons cap, I should have done this on my last one. I had to take conditioner in, after the 1st session I used a children's one as it easier to wash out. You or the nurses spray your hair with water, then put the conditioner on. It makes it easier to take the cap off, as your hair may be covered with ice.",

The pathology reults after the surgery were 8mm G3 invasive + 8mm DCIS, S node clear, after the Onckotype test chemo was recommended. I had 4 cycles of DC, they gave me an anti sickness drug before the chemo, I never felt sick once, did have the tiredness/lack of energy which got worse each cycle. The horrible mouth lack of taste buds isn't very pleasant. Chemo is rubbish but it's doable, I live on my own, managed with help from family & friends. I got out for a short walk when I could, and made sure I had nice things planned for the 3rd week when I felt well. We are all different and most people don't get every side effect. It's 6 months since my last chemo I'm virtually back to normal, well my new normal. I used the scalp cooling so kept about 60% of my hair, it could be worth her giving it a go, it helped me not loosing my hair. I'm not sure how old your mum is, I was 60 a few weeks before being diagnosed. I would say just be there for her to support and help and you'll both get through and come out the other end.

I'm not sure how long for, I'll ask my oncologist next time I see him.  I think most of the bad side effects are rare, I've not noticed any. I decided to take anything offered to prevent recurrence.

It's nearly 3 months since my last one, I feel really well. With hindsight having chemo as given me extra reassurance. I'm taking Tamoxifen for 2 years, followed by Leztrole for 3, also having Zoledronic acid infusion every 6 months. Because I had a mastectomy didn't need any radio.

When I received my results after the operation I had 8mm Grade 3 + 8mm DCIS, sentinel node was clear. Mine was Oestrogen + 6 out 8. This was late 2015, I had 4 cycles of chemo, not pleasant but doable. I suspect your wig lady doesn't know what she's talking about, there's the saying which I think is 'little bit of knowledge being dangerous', or something like that. Take care xx",

I did start panicking has it kept shedding for about 6 to 8 weeks after the last chemo. It did carry in growing all the time even while shedding. Now a year after my last chemo.it all grown back just looks layered. It's in really good condition and thicker than before chemo, also quite curly. Hope this helps.xx",

I had 4 sessions of Doxetacil & Cylophsphamide, had my last one 22 Feb.  I was very worried before hand about all the side effects thought I would get them all. I was fortunate I didn't get many. The lack of energy/tiredness which gets a worse with each cycle & the horrible mouth, nothing tasted right, lived on scrambled egg, tomato soup and ice lollies for nearly 2 weeks out of each 3 week cycle. Try to drink between 3 to 2 litres of liquid a day this helps. Chemo is not a walk in the park, but it is doable and you get through it. Do you mean you're grade 3 rather than stage 3? Take care",

Being estrogen positive means you be able to take medication such as Tamoxifen to prevent it coming back.  I had my chemo after surgery so not sure how long you'll have to wait. Hugs xx",

I didn't paint mine as I was told by my BC there not sure it works and it could mask infections. She did say to keep my hands and feet well moisturised. You should find out what chemo you're having from the oncologist, mine went through in detail the side effects and what to expect, I was also given Macmillan fact sheets for both drugs.
