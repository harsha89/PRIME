      "Content": "Jane3405 Hi. Recovering from stage 2 IDC breast cancer. All good. Op last May followed by 5 weeks of radiotherapy and on letrozole for 5 years.  Clear lymph nodes. However have been suffering from chronic diarhhea since the beginning of January. Have been to my GP and spoke to my oncologist and came off the letrozole for 3 weeks. No change to my embarrassing problem an have been referred today to go to the bowel cancer department of my local hospital in 2 weeks. Clutching at straws I suppose my question is has anyone else suffered from chronic diarhhea after being on letrozole for over 8 months? Xx IHi there, i have had grade 111 ductal cancer and been on arimidex, exemestane and now letrozole....but i have also had huge problems with chronic diarrhoea....and that has been since July this year. I was diagnosed last september and had 4 weeks radiotherapy in jan finishing beginning of feb this year. I am also on ranitidine, ibuprofen, amitriptyline because of neuropathic chest pain due to radiotherapy and statins and clopidogrel has been introduced to prevent clotting. Chronic diarrhoea is so debilitating i have even considered stoping letrozole....but to be honest any of the anti cancer drugs treating oestrogen receptive cancer i have been on still have same side effects along with bone pain and muscle pain, muscle pain can deal with bone pain and tiredness i struggle. The chronic diarrhoea in my case seems to be only addressed with dioralyte relief and stopping ibuprofen and anti clotting drugs so......i am in a catch 22. I really do sympathise tho....am only 53 and my whole life has changed to do with managing this horrendous symptom, and i just want to work and get back to a normal i have a handle on xxxx",
