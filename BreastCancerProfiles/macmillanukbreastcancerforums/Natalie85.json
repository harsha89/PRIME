      "Content": "Hi Kerry Im sorry to hear of your mothers new diagnosis- You have every right to be angry at the whole world! When my mum was told she had secondaries on her spine, chemo suddenly fell out of the equation and she was instead given 1 week of radiation to reduce as much as possible two very small \"spots\" on her spine- the location of these is what was the problem not so much their size. Unfortunately my mum had metastases elsewhere so her condition was very complicated, her oncologist only offered her chemo later on as a pallative treatment (pain management) which she refused, I imagine that is the intention of your mums oncologist also- the radiation is more effective on the spine in terms of reducing its size and therefore any pain your mum is experiencing- as far as i know it wont prevent it from spreading, nor will chemo from what I was told but I must say it felt like all the doctors in the hospital at the time had no idea what they were talking about and all seemed to look to one another for answers! very frustrating! Also every patient is very different and their prognosis will always be differen.If its possible maybe you could ask your mums onc next appointment why Chemo is not an option, and what the next treatment plan is next, so you have full understanding of what is going on.... In my experience, I think they just expect us to sit there and nod and accept that \"they know best\" Im still angry to this day about how my mums spinal compression diagnosis came about- the sooner it is found the better and it sounds like your mums has been found early. I hope this helps.. sending you lots of love and positive energy Natalie xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Hutch I wish you all the best for your appointment, if you have no other metastases elsewhere, SIRT radiation would probably be an excellent treatment option, im not too sure if it is available everywhere but my mum had it done 2 years after she was first diagnosed with liver secondaries and it seemed to work well for at least 6 months she did have extensive mets throughout her liver and still responded well. Don't ever give up hope, the liver is really a magnificant organ, it regenerates quite quickly, you may even be able to have your mets surgically removed if they aren't too extensive. sending you lots of positive energy Natalie xxx",
