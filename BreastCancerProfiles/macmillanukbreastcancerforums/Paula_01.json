      "Content": "I finished treatment at the end of January and I have been struggling with mobility issues since then. I was prescribed exemestane and zoladex which I know cause joint pain. It seems to have got worse over the last few months to the extent I have fallen over on a couple of occasions, once resulting in a horrible black eye and the resulted in an ambulance being called as I had cut my head and it took a little time to stop bleeding. If anyone has found anything which has helped I would love to hear from you. Thanks all Hugs Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi ya  I had Docetaxel as well and the first change over was the worst I didnt' sleep for days because of the pain I was in. The good news was I got feedback from some of the ladies on here and the advice I got was to request additional pain killers. What was suggested to me was Naproxen and Cocodamol. My Oncologist prescribed me both of these going forward and I only took the Naproxen. It was enough to make the pain go away and allow me to sleep again. I didn't have the taste issues particularly, but with the help of the Naproxen I have to say the pain was manageable going forward. I wish you well Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi KiwiCardi  I had the pad that was put on my chest. I was told it was to do with how the skin itself is actually treated so if in your case they are treating the skin itself the pad is to make sure the appropriate dose it given to the skin.  Hope that answers the question.  If you want to ask anything else please do I am about 2 weeks post radio now :) Take Care Paula",
