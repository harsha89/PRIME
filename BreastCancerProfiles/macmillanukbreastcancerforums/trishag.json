      "Content": "Hi all, this is about the 6th time I have tried to post and just not having any luck!II I had my mastectomy 11 weeks ago (after having a lumpectomy in April which found a further 4 cancers). I have had 5 sessions of radiotherapy, but am now really worrying about a lump at the inner side of the scar which I thought was a seroma, but it seems quite hard. I have another lump under the arm which is a seroma and has been drained once since my op. Has anyone else had 'hard' lumps? Many thanks. x",

When do you start your actual treatment? xx",
