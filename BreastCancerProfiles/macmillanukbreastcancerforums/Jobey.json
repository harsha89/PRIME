After speaking to my BCN on the Monday I felt a bit calmer as I'd had CT scan for rads the week before which was clear but jesus it scared the c**p out of me! No one was bothered by it so I tried to forget it but it was two months before it disappeared, my heart is in my mouth when I touch the area now , it's got to easier at some point !! Xx ",

My scar is darker but blends in with the rest of it, I've still got a soft boob and although no one but me and hubby ever sees them they wouldn't notice anything different if they did! Please don't worry , after chemo you will wonder if they are even doing anything with rads, totally painless and over in seconds, I had no ill effects during treatment, went each day after work then home to carry on with my normal routine , best of luck to you Xx Jo ",

My boys were 23 and 25 when I was diagnosed last year, we were in full flow planning my eldest sons wedding in sept and I had to find a way to hit them with this! My mum had died from breast cancer in 2003 so that added to my guilt knowing their only contact with cancer had resulted in them losing their beloved nanny but I wasn't hiding anything from them as she had done with us and had always promised myself if it ever happened I would do be totally up front with them but boy it broke my heart to have to do this to them! However they were amazing and made me so proud , I know they were scared but they were strong and looked after me, each other and their dad and We never hid anything, they saw me have many a melt down and also celebrated with me when things were over, life is tough and there are some things you just can't protect them from sadly, my mum hid her cancer for so long by the time she sought help and told us it Was too late for her and it's something I have always struggled with so I knew I had to be honest with my boys from the off, my eldest was living at home with his fiancé so we told them face to face , our youngest was living away so we told him over the phone, my advice is just tell them , they will be sad but they will cope Xx Jo ",

      "Content": "Hiya love, I'm a few months on from you after being diagnosed in March, I'm due to start radiotherapy tomorrow, It is the most traumatic and surreal thing I've ever experienced and although I'm feeling much more with it now I still can't quite believe what I've been through in the past few months, once you get your results things will start to feel better, you will know what your dealing with and have a plan , the not knowing and the waiting is the absolute worst bit, I found it complete torture! i took my dressings off after a week as I couldn't stand stinking and not being able to shower properly, I did get hubby to put some more on once I had showered but I healed really well and was fortunate to get good results, clear nodes and all cancer completely removed, things will get better and you do find a way to deal with it but it's one step at a time and until you know exactly what your dealing with it's completely normal to feel like you do, good luck for Friday and let us know how you get on xx Jo ",

      "Content": "I think it's standard to wait about 4 weeks from seeing oncologist but it may also be as I don't have any node spread and mine was a fairly straight forward case and I'm having it as a preventative measure against reacurrence and not to treat an actual tumour, to be honest I don't ask many questions, I don't want to know and just do what they tell me! all went well today thank you, was nothing like I expected and really quick and totally painless, just some minor tingling now but about to slather myself in cream before tomorrow's  zapping!!

      "Content": "I was exactly the same, had my op at end of March and was on a total high the first  week then the fear over results day crept in and I barely left my bed for days, it's a massive roller coaster of emotions bit from the day I was told exactly what was happening I've been on the up and up and two months later and half way though rads I'm feeling almost back to normal, some may feel I got off lightly with a low grade cancer and no infected nodes but it's still cancer and there are no guarantees no matter how minor it may seem, you are certainly not being over dramatic, I was a complete wreck but you do get through it although it may not feel like it at the minute, your brain does begin to process what's happening and you find a way to function, I just decided not to try and be happy and put on a face for anyone, I was damn right miserable and wasn't pretending for anybody , be kind for yourself and allow yourself the feelings you are having but never forget they will look after you well and have a plan in place for you on results day, best of luck to you my love xx jo ",
