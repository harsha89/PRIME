I got more from your blog and from this site than going to a breast care meeting at my local church hall which my BCN recommended to meet other ladies diagnosed with BC, I just didn't get any benefit from the meeting so thanks. Keep up the good chemo work Lou xx",

I have since had a mastectomy of my left breast and many lymph nodes removed under my arm. Last Wednesday I went for a post op appt and was informed that after analysis of what they removed they identified stage 2 and stage 3 cells also that out of 18 lymph nodes 13 were positive!!! I then spoke to my breast care nurse who said that I was cancer free, meaning they had removed all known cancer. I then attended  an Oncologist appt last Friday and the news was a lot different. The lump was 15cm and attached to my chest wall and that all the cancer was not removed. I am a diabetic and chemo will  probably not be the best option for me. I am waiting for a PET scan. Oncologist said that it was highly likely that it had spread and that if they entered all my results into computer about life expectancy it would not make nice reading. I am in shock!!!! Two conflicking appts! I also felt unprepared for the oncologist appt. I feel let down by my breast care nurse. I cry, I'm scared and have t eaten properly since Thursday . I don't know what to do",

      "Content": "Thank you June. It really helps to talk to someone who has been through treatment in a similar way. I am trying to come to terms with my diagnosis - mine started as invasive stage 2 and is now stage 3 and aggressive. I had a CT scan about 6 weeks ago which was all clear. I am now having a PET scan as at a high risk it could have gone somewhere else. So worried! I was ER+ and an 8 score and am being told that hormone therpay will work well on me whereas chemo probably won't. This scared me but reading a few stories where ladies have not had chemo I am starting to wonder why I am worried! I had a mastectomy with some invasion into chest muscle and nodes removed so having rads for this. Well done for taking the drugs you are not alone louise x ",

I had a zolodex injection last Friday to shut off ovaries from producing oestrogen as I am stag 3 ER AND PR +. it may be that I will not have chemo so instead they are talking about tamoxifen to start with and then when that stops working there is a ladder of further hormone treatments. is there anyone else in the same situation. There is a high possibility I will never been cured from BC but BCN said that patients can take only hormone treatment for years - is this correct, is there anyone who is at doing only hormone treatment? I am very scared to say the least and just cant pick myself up. ",

No worries if not as it's a very personal question. My cancer was a very high osetrogen fuelled cancer so I have had ovaries switched off via zolodex. Not on tamoxifen yet as waiting for PET scan as I have a high risk it could have spread. They haven't ruled out chemo but it probably isn't going to be beneficial to me whereas hormone therapy will be. Why do you get bloating is this because of the osteoporosis? Take care Louise x ",

Anne's er score  was mid range which meant she might not get the full benefit of hormonal therapies Which is the reason chemo was recommended. The higher your score the more benefit you get from hormonal therapies i.e. They work better. Your ER score would have been out of 8. hormonal therapies with a high score would have been enough without chemo. I know it's easy for us to compare diagnosis but there is so much to consider.  Love Julia x ",
