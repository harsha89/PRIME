I am at work today and all of the office are Pinking the who;le building in advance because we are holding a Pink Friday on 30th October in support of Breast Cancer (ironically I sorted this out before I found my lump) but we are going all out now. I didn't think I would be able to make it into work this week cos I felt so awful Mon and Tues but the shock is easing and the encouragement received from this site has been unbelievable so it one day at a time. Take care Love  Terri xx",

      "Content": "Hi Judith, Welcome to the club no one wants to join, there is fantastic support on here, you can rant and rave as much as you like and all of those questions that run around inside your head that you are too scared to voice can be voiced on here and 9 times out of 10 there is someone here with the answers. I was diagnosed on 5th Oct and like you the bottom fell out of my world, I have 3 children, two girls 15 and 16 and a 3 and a half year old son, like you I though this was it, who would look after my kids. I had a  lumpectomy and node clearance on 7th Oct and then was advised to have a mastectomy as they did not have a clear margin and there was 1 node affected out of 9 removed. I have had my mastectomy on 4th Nov. Like others have already said its not as bad as you think and the staff are fantastic, when the results came back last week they said it was the right choice as more cells were found in the remaining tissue. It took me a while to be able to look at the scar but when I did it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. I am now waiting for an appointment with the oncologist to find out when chemo will start but the waiting is worse than the results so try not to get too stressed out (easier said than don I know). I have added you as friend so if I can be of any further help just shout. take care love Terri xxx",
