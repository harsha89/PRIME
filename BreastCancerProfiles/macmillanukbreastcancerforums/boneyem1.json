      "Content": "Thankyou for all your advice. I have had counselling and obviously it hadn't helped. I live in fear every day and I also have flashbacks. I have now found a sore lump in my armpit this morning. I feel like I'm drowning. Someone did suggest I may have ptsd. Having to have a hysterectomy last year hasn't helped and the panic attacks aren't getting any easier. Xx",

      "Content": "Hiya. I am wondering if I could get some advice. I had breast cancer 3 years ago. I had radiotherapy (Specialist said I didn't need chemo) I am now on tamoxifen. I had a breakdown a year and a half ago about bc and a few other things. I live in fear everyday that bc will return Â I have seriously been thinking of having both my breast removed. I had a hysterectomy last year due to they thought I had ovarian cancer. thank god it wasn't. I understand people live with it hanging over their heads if it's going to return however I can't deal with it anymore. I was just wondering what advice I can get and do you think I'm being stupid. xx",
