      "Content": "hello  i had my last chemo 3 weeks ago. As I am triple positive (not negative!) I have had 4 sessions of EC and 4 sessions of Herceptin in combination with 2 other drugs. on Monday I had my first Herceptin injection. my hair all fell out on the EC chemo, but started growing back on my head and legs, my eye lashes still not growing, but today my head hair started falling out again. I noticed it in the bath. its the same pain in my scalp as during my chemo when I lost my hair. could Herceptin be the culprit? I haven't heard anything about it before now... operation on Saturday... ",

      "Content": "Hello I have been diagnosed with triple positive invasive lobular breast cancer. Its like a desert out there when i try to find out more about this very kind of cancer. The only online things I can find are either old groups for support pre 2012 or some hugely academic stuff that I cannot understand. Am I even a type? As I cannot be typed in the 4 groups that the Mayo clinic publish and actually fall outside most \"normal\" cancers...  Well I hope there is someone out there that can help me. Just in middle of chemo now (have had 4 of 8) and planning a hairless summer in the sun! Keep smiling :) you might brighten someones day! ",
