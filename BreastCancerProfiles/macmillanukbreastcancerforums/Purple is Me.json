      "Content": "Hi Sarah. I initially had lumpectomy and total node clearance. I was driving after 2 weeks as my BCN had said do things as I feel comfortable doing them. I have now had a mastectomy and a different BSN said not to drive for 3 weeks as insurance wouldn't cover you. I was sent home with paracetamol, brufen and Tramadol. I mostly only needed the brufen and paracetamol. You can also be prescribed Â Gabapentin if you do suffer from very bad nerve pain. Mine was quite bad for the first week after clearance but the more you touch the area (very light massage) the better it gets. Good luck for op. The exercises really help xxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Am now 4 days post mastectomy - 4 weeks ago had lumpectomy and lymph node clearance. CT scan performed last week and given results on morning of mastectomy surgery. CT highly suggestive of breast cancer cells in Liver. Had ultrasound day after op but were unable to get results before discharged. Now have to wait until next Thursday when I see surgeon. Obviously very anxious!!!!!! Is anyone else going through this and what does living with secondary liver cancer mean???????",
