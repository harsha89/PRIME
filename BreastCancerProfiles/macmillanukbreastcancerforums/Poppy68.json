    "Content": "Hi Sharon,  your story sounds very like mine andI went on that holiday and made sure I enjoyed every minute of it! Five days will make absolutely no difference especially when you will be starting your treatment so soon. When you go on holiday you will think about your cancer but just let it flow into how wonderful your holiday is. Im so glad I went to on holiday because it gave me a kind of mental build up to it, positive of course.  I agree with the other girl here, call the Macmillian nurses here about ANYTHING, I do, they are wonderful and nothing is a small question. My oncologist was just there to give the bare fact, the nurse seem to know everything! use them. I really wish you a wonderful holiday. Where are you going?  Joy xx",
