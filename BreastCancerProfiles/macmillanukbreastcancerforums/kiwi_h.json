I've only had 1 dose and while I did have a sleeping tablet on day1 as they gave me steroids, since then my sleep has been TERRIBLE. Is this a common thing? I guess it could be stress stopping me, but usually Im a good sleeper. Any advice appreciated!xx",

I'm feel SO over this journey (since July '17 I've had 4 surgeries plus other chemo last year, that didn't work) and I'm scared of the Taxol side-effects, namely the neuropathy /loss of feeling in my feet etc. I know not everyone gets that but for some reason its terrifying me.

As much as you can, just focus on ONE day at a time. Just this dose, and the days of recovery. It does help- you can\u2019t do more than that, and thinking forward to other doses doesn\u2019t help.  Also, be open with your team about every single side effect. They can help manage them to make it easier- don\u2019t be shy.  As for hair- I feel you! I\u2019m cold capping too- it\u2019s awful. But hang in there, and ensure the person putting on the Cap ensures the right size and a good fit- where there is a gap between skin and cap there is hair loss.  Hang in there babe - we\u2019re cheering you on! ",

But I may have had a similar issue- it was caused by constipation (sorry) that led to a weird indigestion where I felt that I had a balloon in my stomach and it felt like I could barely eat or swallow. Does that sound familiar? In any case, for me once I'd sorted the constipation, the indigestion sorted itself. But as always- maybe call the onco suite and see if they have any suggestions? (eg could it be a normal sore throat from someone who had it and visited?). Whatever it is- i hope it resolves soon. Take care of yourself!!",

Apparently the new recommendation is: -30min prior -duration of chemo -90min post-chemo I tried some strategies that really helped- while it wasn't a pleasure to do it (understatement), the things below made it far more bearable. 1. Take 2 paracetamol and codiene 30min before the start of the cooling. (* please ask if this is OK and not and there are no interactions with your chemo/other meds!)  2. Have two heat pads - one under your back, high up and one on your chest/stomach etc.  (could bring in hot water bottles?) 3. Hot drinks- all throughout the cooling. I had soup and tea (bonus as they help with hydration) I think the cumulative impact of all of these things really helped. Also- I told my oncologist about the new cooling procedure and they weren't aware- so it's definitely worth mentioning it. Any other suggestions? Good luck to everyone on this mad journey!  ",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, I've had 1/4 cycles of TC, my 2nd is on 07Sep. Feeling pretty anxious about it as I'm finally feeling more human after dose #1... re cold-cap, I had to wear it for 4 bloody unpleasant hours. But- I've still got my hair today (fingers crossed that stays!) . I took 2 paracetamol beforehand, which did nothing. However I asked if I could take codiene this time and was told it was fine (no interaction with the TC chemo). Will report back if that helps at all! good luck everyone",

      "Content": "Hi All, Well I'm coming out of the woods after my 2nd dose... did anyone else find the second was both better (less anxiety than the 1st) but worse (more dread as you know what's to come)? I also found my mood dipped VERY low, really sad days during this one. Just feeling very hopeless in the face of more chemo to come and possibly radiotx, and then more surgery. Other than that, the usual suspects of nausea, mouth sores, intense fatigue and bone marrow pain (from the Neublasta). I needed more anti-nausea tablets this time vs dose 1. I continue to lose some hair, developed a rather unsexy bald patch on my crown :(  Still, I think its where the cold cap didnt reach, so will keep using it- even though its awful to go through, sometimes it feels like one cold capping is one of the only areas in which I do have some control, so will keep at it. I hope everyone has the best possible Friday. Good luck to anyone getting their dose today!  Hang in there.",

I struggled with it for a day (I was an idiot, I thought it was nerve pain and painkillers wouldn't work ). Once I took painkillers the pain was more manageable, and the pain wasn't as bad after dose 2. Sending a hug! ",
