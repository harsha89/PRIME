    "Content": "Hi. I was diagnosed in January 2015 with grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, after a clear mammogram and ultrasound.  A biopsy finally confirmed my suspicions.  I'm 41. I had a mastectomy on 10th February...2 weeks ago already!  I also had my lymph nodes removed....29 in total, 5 were cancerous.  I'm having a CT scan next week and I'm meeting my oncologist to discuss my chemo and radiotherapy (which I'd led to believed will commence sooner rather than later). It is exhausting, but I'm finding each day is easier......however, I do find I have more discomfort from my arm than my chest. Keep strong.   This is a lovely site and much appreciated. Louise  ",
