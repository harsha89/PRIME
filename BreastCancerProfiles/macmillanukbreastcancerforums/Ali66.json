      "Content": "Hi to everyone, This is my first post, but I just wanted to say how much better it's made me feel reading this thread. I had my second round of FEC-T two days ago and despite using the cold cap, my hair is coming out in handfuls and I'm finding it more difficult than I thought.  I've always washed my hair every day, blowdryed it, used straighteners - the whole lot! It's shoulder length so seeing it come out in big clumps is making it worse. I think I need to phone the hairdresser now and see about getting it cut short. I did buy a wig and although friends have told me it's really good, it just seems really wiggy to me - a bit bouffant and 'done'. So I think I might get on better with headscarves and some lovely earrings (another excuse to go shopping!). I shall definitely look at the websites that you've recommended. Thanks again, Ali  ",

      "Content": "Hi Tracy, Have you looked into using the cold cap? It's not pleasant but it might be worth a go if you want to try to keep your hair. I had my second FEC last Monday (with the cold cap) and hair started coming out in handfuls on Tuesday so I had it cut quite short on Wednesday. It felt really good to be back in control but I'm not sure I would have done it if it hadn't started falling out. It's still falling out a little bit but not nearly as much and so far I don't have any bald patches so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I won't lose much more. I'm not loving my short hair yet but everyone's been so positive that I'm coming round to it. I even went to work today and colleagues told me I look younger! (Not sure if they're just being nice.) I've decided to go to a department store and get my make up done as I feel a bit more exposed with so little hair and feel I need a bit of armour. No more hiding behind my hair. If anyone has any suggestions for who does the best department store makeovers then I'd be grateful. The only other suggestion I have is to take it a day at a time - you'll know if you feel the time is right for a chop. Good luck and let us know how you get on. Ali x      ",

      "Content": "Hi all, Thanks for all the advice and encouragement. I had my hair chopped short on Wednesday and it does feel good to have done something positive (although it's still coming out in handfuls). The good news is that my daughter wasn't freaked out and has decided it's quite funky. I'm just plucking up courage to go to the playground now and she's promised to help me shop for headscarves! I don't know what I'll do if it carries on falling out - I don't feel brave enough to shave it just yet - but I'm trying to take it one day at a time.  I guess it's only hair! Ali x  ",
