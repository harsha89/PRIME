      "Content": "Hi Suzyjane, I had my op (mastectomy & tissue expander implant under the pectoral muscle) in March. Although not the same op as yours, I did walk into the theatre (which you asked about). I was put in a bed in the ward and wheeled down to the pre-op room next to the theatre, but was then asked to hop off the bed and walk in to the theatre. It was the first time I've had an op so I didn't know what to expect anyway. Once in the theatre I was asked to lie on the operating table and they then put the needles into the back of my hand for the anaesthetic. Luckily I didn't find it too painful. Like you I'm not over-impressed with my new boob - it doesn't match the existing one (which droops much more!), and is an odd shape, and I still find it uncomfortable (though not painful). But I'm hoping that when they replace the tissue expander with a permanent silicone implant it might look better and be more comfortable. Sorry I can't help with your queries related to the LD flap , but I hope you find that the tightness reduces soon and it gets more comfortable for you. Nic",

      "Content": "Hi Cashvyj, Yes I think I am glad I had it done, though when its uncomfortable I sometimes wonder whether I should have just gone flat on that side ! But I like the fact that I don't have to bother with a prosthesis and with most clothes you wouldn't even notice the lop-sidedness. ...I think my original temp expander didn't have silicone in it - just a saline-filled bag so replacing it with the silicone-only one probably helped it to feel a little softer. Since the replacement in Sept 2017 I seem to be developing some fat between the implant and the skin which makes it look better. Both the original mastectomy (Mar 2015) and the replacement implant (Sep 2017) were relatively simple ops and I recovered quickly. For the mastectomy I stayed in hospital a couple of nights; for the implant swap it was just a day-surgery. Best of luck with your decision. Nic",

      "Content": "Hi Curlietop, I haven't had the TUG....during my mastectomy they put in a tissue expander implant with a mesh connected to the pectoral muscle to support it. I decided to just have that replaced with a silicone implant as I was fed up with hospitals and didn't want to risk cutting up other bits of my body.  They could not match the size of my existing 38D boob, so I'm currently lop-sided (probably a pert C on the implant side!). They have offered me a reduction of the other boob, but I'm not sure I'll bother - again, why risk an op, and I've got used to being a bit lop-sided, and use a knitted knocker to pad out if required...most of the time I don't bother. It's sometimes a bit uncomfortable, even with the silicone implant, which I think is due to how the mesh support is connected onto the muscle, but I've got used to it now, and the surgeon said that the body gradually gets used to it. Best of luck with your decision ! Nic",

In Sept 2017 I had the temp expander replaced with a silicone implant - the surgeon used the original scar (which is horizontal across the middle of the boob for me as I had to lose the nipple as well)  to access the implant. He said that the body would already have grown tissue around the mesh to incorporate it. I didn't notice any extra effect to the muscle, but I do sometimes get the same pulling sensation on the pectoral muscle that I had before. It was a day surgery for me and the scar healed again quickly (no drains this time fortunately!) Best of luck !",

      "Content": "Hi Alison, I had a PICC line put in just before my first of 6 FEC-T - it was standard practice in my hospital. I was glad not to have the cannula for each chemo session. I had no trouble with it except on one occasion when it seemed to be blocked but one of the nurses eventually managed to clear it. I had to get it flushed once a week by a nurse at my local cottage hospital. . They give you a stretchy bandage sleeve to cover it so that you don't catch it on anything. You also need to ask for (or buy) a shower sleeve (approx £5 in Boots) to cover it when showering. Good luck! Nic",

      "Content": "Hi Mam to 3, I was in the same position as you three years ago - diagnosed in Jan 2015 with ER+, 4.5cm tumour. Luckily the CT and bone scans showed no spread at that time. I had a mastectomy (with temp implant) where they found that 5 out of 16 lymph nodes were affected. So then had 6 FEC-T chemo followed by radiotherapy. Although the surgery and chemo are no fun, they were not as bad as I had anticipated. They are do-able especially with support from family and people on here who are going through (or have been through) the same thing. I had the temp implant replaced with a silicone boob in Sept 2017, and now just have the aromatase inhibitor tablets (Letrozole in my case) for 7 more years, and one more bisphosphonates infusion to go (to reduce the chance of it coming back in the bones). I have no issues with either of these. I still worry about the chance of recurrence but hopefully that will get easier over time. So don't despair - there are plenty of us who had the same diagnosis and are now (hopefully!) free of cancer several years down the line. Best of luck ! Nic",

      "Content": "Hi twinkle79, I think its always best to get anything you are not sure of checked by your GP. They would much rather you go to get it checked than leave it and worry. Hopefully its nothing unusual and they can just reassure you. If they are not sure then they will refer you to the hospital for further tests, which may still find that its not cancer, but better to be safe than sorry. I had no family history of BC and led a fairly healthy life (though a bit overweight) and I was diagnosed with BC 2 years ago, which hopefully has gone after surgery, checmo & radiotherapy. So it doesn't only run in families. I'd recommend getting it checked to put your mind at rest. You might be worried for a few days while they (possibly) do tests, but once they're done you can (hopefully) stop worrying about it. Good luck! Nic.",

I don't know if my bone density has changed yet as I've not had a repeat Dexa scan. I've not lost weight on the letrozole. The oncologist recommended having intravenous bisphosphonates as it would help to retain strength in the bones and also help to reduce the risk of secondaries setting up in the bones. For the bisphosphonates you could ask about having a 6-monthly intravenous infusion as this is a lot less hassle than the tablets which you have to take and then remain upright for 30 minutes (I think?). I am due for my second 6-monthly infusion next week, and had no obvious side-effects from the first one. There is a slight risk of bone problems in the jaw if you have to have tooth removal etc, but the dentist would refer you to the hospital in that case. Good luck ! Nic",
