    "Content": "Hi you'll come through it ok..Like you i found the Dox was much more severe  than the FEC but i was told to take Co_codomal and have to say they really helped to curb the joint pain... Heat too helped.. Those wheat bags you put in the microvave were quite soothing... I wont lie and say the next one will be easy but I found the second one was slighty less severe.. then it just levelled out . The joint pain only lasted a few days but was controllable. The staff should be able to advice you on other anti sickness tabs if the ones you have are not working...please ask them Stay strong it will pass and you'll come out the other side sooner than you think best wishes to you",
