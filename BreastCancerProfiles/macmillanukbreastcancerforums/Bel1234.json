      "Content": "I do not have breast cancer but my mum has, she has been in hospital for 5 weeks after taxotere extreme reaction even though they reduced by 20% it still hit her hard her oncologist was really shocked by her reaction but to be honest I don't think she had recovered from her first round of tax before they hit her with another. She has now been rushed back in after collapsing she has no recollection of friday and is still feeling confused. They say she has an infection but not sure where and an mri scan is booked for monday once the hospital comes back to life after the weekend which I find really frustrating. I am so worried that something awful is going on. A few of you have mentioned the liver and they say that her liver function is down but I don't understand it all enough. I am panicking a little.I think you are all so so so brave xxx",
