      "Content": "Please Help !! Im a 44 yr old women who has had upper back / shoulder pain for about a yr. GP keeps giving me pain killers and Naproxin for it,  i have also had steriod injections.  The pain has become worse and is now in my left breast for a few weeks, its like a stinging stabbing pain, in my boob , armpit and down my left arm so went back to GP on Friday , he then examined my breast and has found 2 lumps ! ( which i cant feel btw ) and given me a urgent refferal to the breast cancer clinic. Im a mum of 2 beautiful boys and im convinced i now have BC now, i also have noticed a tiny blood type mark on that same breast at the bottom and this has been there for about 6 months.  So i have my appointment today at 3pm and have not slept a wink all night. Can someone pls help me with any advice ?  Does anyone on here have a similar story ? Have i left it too long ?  Im just so scared and my husband is too , im frightened of what im going to hear today. Thanks and all you brave amazing ladies keep being amazing. Nikki      ",
