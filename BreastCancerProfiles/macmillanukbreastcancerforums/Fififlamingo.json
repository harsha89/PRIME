      "Content": "Hi Sam, this caught me out after day 8 of 1st chemo and ended up in A&E but all checked out ok, as I had pains in my chest bone and back.  I initially thought I was having a severe panic attack (not had any before) as was very short of breath and the more I was concerned the worse the pain was.  I am taking FEC-T. After nearly 8 hrs in A&E and all checks done, there was no exact cause but put it down to side effects and suggested taking paracetamol.  Funnily I'm at day 8 today of cycle 2 and having mild pains in chest again, I am taking paracetamol and they are subsiding.   This is not saying that what you are experiencing may be this and of course the triage/oncology are always on hand if you have any concerns. Last month by back/chest pain only lasted 2 days and nothing in between until tonight.  I feel more relaxed as the paracetamol is working but will monitor it as you should. I hope this may help.

      "Content": "Hi Wynneth, I had a mastectomy in July and had to be drained twice so I know how you must be feeling,  its so uncomfortable, a nurse gave me a suggestion to stop the seroma filling up is to compress the void with something, I used a beanbag in my bra for 3 days/nights and that did the trick.  It never filled up again.  Just used Bio oil to help massage the scar. As the days went on it was easier to continue with physio and try to get arm above head, with this I used a elastic resistant band and various exercises to gradually lift arm.  I also used a dressing robe belt over the top of a door and used gravity to sea saw exercise to help with arm stretches. Hope you become more comfortable soon. Louisa x ",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne, it was the same for me but i turned 50 in June when I was diagnosed with BC the day before I was due to fly out to Egypt for 10 days.  It was a tough decision at the time but I realised that I won't have a holiday in a while so I went and made some lovely memories. When I came back, I started with CT and MRI scan (which I haven't had before) I was able to close my eyes and use those memories to get me through it during these scans. I've since had a mastectomy and on my 3rd chemo, I can't believe how quickly the time has gone. I've always taken little steps to get through it, and crying helps release the sadness but I do feel much better afterwards. Try and not to worry about reading everything, just the bits you are about to enter into, I felt I needed to be ready in my head to read more info.  However you deal with it, the support from this forum or family and friends will help along the road to recovery.  Stay strong and wish you all the best during this worrying time.  Louisa xx ",

      "Content": "I was feeling the same anxiety when I first found the lump in my breast, I didn't know then i had them in lymph nodes until the ultrasound and then biopsy.  They initally said it would be in 1 node and ended up in 3 during surgery, so I assumed it was on the move, so once I had the CT and MRI they confirmed no further spread.  It was such a relief. I would expect you to have the same soon.  I did feel much better once I knew.  Could you speak to the breast care nurses to confirm when your appointment would be? Try not to worry too much, the process is quite quick whatever you treatment ends up, the last 2 months has gone really fast. xx",

      "Content": "HI Scaredgirl, I totally understand how you feel and you have every right to be scared, but I deal with it in little steps, each stage is an achievement and as soon as the surgery was over the cancer for me was out - now its just the road to recovery - unfortunately you need to be feel ill to get better. I'm a little bit on from you, was diagnosed stage 3 BC  in June and had a mastectomy in July with 16 lymph nodes removed  (3 were cancerous) and today was my first chemotherapy which apart from feeling a bit whoosie, it was another step ticked. My children are 17 and 22 and they are asking questions, I tell them what they need know and I try and act normal around them although they are happy to help out more - I just need to ask them when. I always think the body reacts to you, so if you have a strong positive attitude the body will respond to that. I meet a lovely couple today and the lady is going through the same treatment as me for the first time, so the hospital have rescheduled our sessions all the way through so we can go through this together. This site is good to keep you reassured you're not alone in this, be strong and don't forget to take little steps not look at the whole picture, unless you see yourself on a beach and blue skies and rum cocktails when its all done :0) Take care xx",
