      "Content": "Hello, I received a call from my hospital in early September 2012, 4 months after my mamo in May 2012 showed a lump - which turned out to be breast cancer and lymph node cancer (cancer spread).  I am now post op awaiting histology results for treatment starting in 10 days time.  Does anyone have any advice or experience they could offer on this - does the delay warrant negligence from the hospital?  What should I do about it?  Who should I report this to and are there any official lines of enquiry I could follow.  The hospital promised me a full internal investigation feedback, but after 5 weeks I am still waiting for it.  Has anyone out there experienced a similar situation from their hospital? What did you do about it? Thanks for any feedback.",
