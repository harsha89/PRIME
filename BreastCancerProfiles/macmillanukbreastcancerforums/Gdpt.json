      "Content": "Hello helsjw I really feel for you and I hope you are feeling a little bit lifted by the support on here. My mum was diagnosed last week and we are awaiting her results next Weds. We are in total shock. Although I'm not the patient myself, I understand the torture of this wait. It's unspeakably hard. I can't imagine how it feels for you. For me it's hard to believe that this is the worst bit but you know everyone on here says the waiting is the worst- and they must know what they're talking about! I'm sure you're still in shock (I know I am) but you'll get to Weds and you'll get a plan and you'll start to clobber this. As my Mum will.  Try and feel the joy in each day as I\u2019m sure you did before you found out.  I'll watch out for you. I'm so sorry you are here but really you have a lot of support already xx ",

      "Content": "Hello Jo Thank you so much for your response. I'm sorry to hear about your Mum. You must have been terrified at the time. I hope you are ok now. I hate the thought that I get to go home and have a cuddle and a cry with my husband but she doesnt have that. Did you feel like that? My sister and her family have been visiting since Thursday and they are going back tomorrow morning. My family and I moved to be near Mum in March so we are only 20 mins' drive away. I think I'll go and stay at with Mum tomorrow once I've put the kids to bed or something.  I've been keeping busy over the weekend. We went To app farm yesterday and today we had a family party for my 2 year old. I can just get through but as soon as im aline- to the loo, in loading the dishwasher, it hits me.  This week will be slower. Because we've recently moved we don't know anyone and my husband commutes to London still while he looks for work down here so there's not a lot going on. But I'll see if Mum and I can do a few things with my 2 year old. Thank you for the tip to call Breast Cancer Care. I'm going to do that tomorrow. Thanks again for your kindness xx",

      "Content": "Hello  I hope you are all ok this morning. I went to an appoint with my mum on Thurs eve and she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  We are in total shock and I'm terrified. I'm 5 months pregnant and I am having the worst thoughts while we wait for the biopsy results. I don't know how to do this wait and be strong for my Mum and my young children. My family is very close knit, although mum's on her own as dad died many years ago when we were little. Mum is our world. I feel like I'm being really selfish I'm just finding it so hard to hold it together. I keep thinking 'what if this is actually the good bit?' I.e. not knowing the results in case they are really bad. The Dr said he was 'very concerned' and that she presented with multiple tumours- one big and a number of satellite tumours around it. I'm terrified that could mean it's elsewhere. Mum's lost lots of weight over past 5 or so months. She said she's just not hungry. She looks good though, not unwell. I'm not religious but I find myself really praying for a break. We are all out of our depth here. I feel like this is a terrible thing that happens to other people's families if you see what I mean.  I'd love to hear from you. I'm so sorry you are all here xx",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly I'm so touched by your response. It is so nice to be able to talk without feeling guilty. I feel like I have to limit what I say to my family because it seems selfish and I don't want to upset anyone further.  I'm really sorry to hear you and your family have had to go through something similar. I hope you are doing ok now And your daughter had a lovely baby! I don't want my Mum to have to worry about me, she really has enough on her plate. It really is confidence building to think that this is common and curable. I suppose I haven't been looking at it like that. We are doing lots of nice things while we wait to hear. In fact we are all off to a farm today. Thank you again xx ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone Thanks again for all your kind words and support at this scary time. I keep looking back at all your responses which are really helpful. I'm so sorry I haven't responded to everyone- it's not through lack of appreciation at all: I'm a bit stumped right now and still in shock, although I think it's easing a bit as I'm getting a bit more sleep now. I hope you are all OK and enjoying this sunny weather xx  We went back to a different doc yesterday who had a much better manner and who gave us confidence that we would get a treatment plan in place. He checked my mum and they think there's a lump or a few in her lymph nodes too so she had 4 more biopsies, another ultrasound and a CT scan. The care was excellent and quite different from our experience at the other hospital. We have to wait another week for all the results to come through.  It will be another tough week but I feel as though we have a good team now, which is something. I'm terrified still that it's spread. I know I shouldn't dwell on this stuff but Mum missed 2 screenings (I saw it on the GP's screen) and I had been begging her to get a health check for many months because she's been going through a very stressful time otherwise and this was ignored. I know it's not helpful but sometimes these things are hard to get out of your head. Mum was amazing- just so brave. I'm so incredibly proud of her. My sis and I took her home for some supper and she made my sis and herself a cocktail!! She doesn't really drink but it was nice.  I still don't know how you are all doing this. I am inspired by your strength. I just need to find my own. Xx ",
