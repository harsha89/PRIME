      "Content": "Hi there. I actually didn't suffer with the metallic taste but was advised at the chemo unit to eat a slice of pineapple or pineapple chunks from a tin, apparently that removes the metal taste. I did lose all of my sense of smell and taste the second week of my first Fec which is horrible and sadly means that food and drink means very little from an enjoyment point of view. I thought this would be the norm until I finished chemo but funnily enough the day of my second FEC my smell and taste came back and so far it's stayed, have never been so happy to smell and taste things.   The only thing I could even vaguely taste previously was orange juice, but I think really it's a case of making sure you keep up your fluids whether you can taste or not. Good luck in finding something that helps a bit. x",

      "Content": "Hi Elaine, hmmm the irony, I think you have to laugh though. My hair is slowly coming along, but like you for quite a while I had a bald piece at the front, but now it's growing nicely there. Of course it's not the colour it was but at least it's growing. I'm looking forward to the day when I can make a hair appt. I'm going to try Toni and Guy, who are in partnership with MacMillan and have staff trained specially to style hair of people after hair loss. I'm glad the manager is letting you use the offer when you're ready for your first styling, something to look forward to.",

      "Content": "Hi Ally, this chemo is a funny old thing. Yes they tell you to drink a lot after your treatment which I do, but from what I understand it's so that it doesn't sit in your kidneys. If you're worried definitely contact your onc unit or someone from here. My tiredness, first FEC hit me day 4 & 5 I'm very lucky I've had no other symptoms other than 2 days of weariness and losing my taste and smell for two weeks. Second FEC my taste and smell came back and has stayed, thankfully, but had a few more days of tiredness. Now, having had  my third treatment I once again had 2 days on 4 & 5 of tiredness but am feeling fit as a flea since then. There really doesn't seem to be any reasoning how this takes effect and I'm just trying to roll with the punches. Hope you can speak to someone to allay your worries about drinking too much, I'm sure drinking so much won't have flushed away any effectiveness. Take care. xx",

Fec was a total walk in the park compared to T it's completely wiped me out I've never felt so poorly but the end is in sight. I hope you get through this cycle without too many s/e and that you go out to celebrate after week 3 and it's finally all over for you. x",

      "Content": "I've had my first Tax last week so I'm encouraged to read that just maybe the next 2 won' t  be so bad or at least a little bit less so. Have to say I've never felt so ill the last week, I think I've probably had every side effect so I'm due a loyalty card LOL. Had a couple of sessions in the chemo unit this week because of feeling so ill, temp up and blood count low, I'm due to go on a short holiday on Monday so fingers crossed that'll happen. Then back  home for round 2, something I'm now dreading, but at least that's NO 5 and only 1 more after that. I keep chanting \"The end is in sight,  6 weeks and it's done\", it's not helping but maybe if I say it often enough. Good luck to anyone who's starting Tax, it's a nasty little devil but if it does it's job. xx",

      "Content": "The first thing I'd do is call your Chemo nurse on your rapid response phone number, if you have one.  I know we Brits don't like to \"be a bother\" but it's really important to get their advice. I certainly wouldn't use any over the counter medication until I'd checked with them, it may have a contra effect to something else you're taking. Keep checking your temp make sure that's ok but try and contact them. And most definitely if you do have to go to A & E then show them your card, don't wait around in a waiting room.Hope this helps x",
