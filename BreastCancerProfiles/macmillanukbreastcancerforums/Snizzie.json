      "Content": "Once again this stupidvtablet has eaten a reply! Lol Yes everyone has made good points. Yes , I am a pathetic excuse for a human, I know this and despise myself for it. Iposted for 2 reasons. I needed to tell someone how I felt. Also as I didn't get a chance to speak to my McMillan nurse since the op on Friday, I thought maybe this place was meant to be a communication vector. Fear\u2026yes, I have problems with fear. I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of being helpless. Alsoi have been told that I am on the autistic spectrum, and I'm waiting for an appointment at a neurobehavioural  clinic. This fault in my brain means that I have trouble with truth. It's like I can't get my head round the ideavof being lied to, or not being told the full truth, especially if it has a bearing on a decision I must make. I also tend to take people at their word, so if they say 'tell me how you feel' then I'll end up saying far too much. Ican only say that I am who I am. I've tried hard to beat back this weird stuff about me, but under great duress my control just falls apart.if I have posted inapproprialy, I apologise. And I thank everyone for the advice given.

      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses.It has taken me hours to get back. My account had been deleted and they Said my email address had never been used to make an account. Another email that was sent to help was nothing but a page where the only contact number Was the maim one. I called it and discovered That the ' mcmillan nurse'you are assigned works for the NHS. Do, any problem with the NHS And the McMillan's are not free entities that can help. They are paid by the NHS. I have been changed by my operation. My life is now as a spectator, not a participant. I must buy bread, not make it. I have to stand by while others carry my shopping bags, can never scramble up a hill with the dog, help my husband, without risking lymphoedma. Whether or not the cancer comes, I will have to guard against it every time I weed the garden wash my back or clean the toilet. In all honesty a fast battle with cancer, feel better to me thsn to live as an  invalid for my last few years.",

      "Content": "I wrote a long reply, and it hasn't come up Yeah, I'm choosing death, should it come, because the removal of the nodes creates an unbearable fear that I cannot deal with. I'm already feeling it. About my single eye. Glaucoma destroyed the sight in the other. I have had to fdeal with fear for 20 years. Irrational unbearable fear. Now I have the same for my arm. I've been hospitalised for psychiatric issues regarding the fear. The. Incipient lympofdoem is one thing oo much. It sounds pathetic, but it's true. Fear has destroyed my for 20  years, this ymph thing is one too much. The worst thing is tht if I had been given the info it would never have happened, I could have made the right decision for me.",

      "Content": "Yes lovely post, and I am happy for you. Thething is, I would not have had the nodes removed if I had been given the info before rather than after, when it was too late. I have been crippled against my will. I have tried to deal with this, but this site has tried to lock me out and silenced me. as McMillan nurses are NHS employees, they cannot be trusted. They'll section you if they mess up, to discredit your complaint.",

      "Content": "Found a lump early Feb. Went to Dr. Booked into hospital dept within 2 weeks. And after tests including mri, was told it was cancer grade 3 and I should have surgery.  During McMillan conversation after I was told that lymphoma could be a problem. I didn't want that, so against my better judgement i agreed to a sentinel node biopsy, after being told the risk there was negligible After that I asked if there were any leaflets for me this time. She said not. However immedeatly after the op some McMillan's came and showednme some booklets. They said, you'll have seen these already, but well just go through the main points with you. I had never been shown them and therefore did not know that the quality of every part of my life would be destroyed by the removal of the sentinel node. The hospital were unhelpful and the staff deliberately rude, obstructive and unsympathetic. they attempted to get me sectioned because I said I would make a complaint. I will never return to that hospital, not even to follow up the op. Their clear dislike of me makes it obvious that grudges would be used to make me suffer. Nor can I go to my gp as they will take the hospitals part against mine, and I will never trust a MacMillan nurse. They do not help you, they have not helped me in any way that was useful, and some that has been harmful. I will be on the internet as much as I can putting my story on every UK cancer site. We are told we can trust McMillan, but they destroyed and betrayed my trust.",
