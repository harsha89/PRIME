      "Content": "Thanks everyone, it is most likely what you have said, ache from the biopsy and being more aware of it being there. It doesn't ache when I am doing other stuff, mostly when I am sat down or just snuggling into bed. Thanks Jo, I will definitely try ringing up, but I do seem to remember that the consultant said she was going on holiday. Certainly feel a bit more easier now thanks. It is just that once you start thinking your mind runs away with you lol. Liz xx",

I am seeing the BCN next Monday, pre op 19th, consultant appt 21st. Should I contact them before that or do you think everything will be ok? Thanks in advance xx",

I did phone the BCN up about the ache and after leaving a message asking a 'silly question' was contacted soon after and reassured. She also told me that there are no silly questions lol. Thanks for the heads up though  Liz xx",

      "Content": "Hi I started my EC chemo on the 5th. That first day when I got home I felt like I had been hit by a steamroller I had a massive headache/migraine. I already suffer from migraines but am trying to decide if my ongoing headache is due to the ondansetron or caffeine withdrawal. I am know for drinking cups of tea and hubby jokingly says I would be ok plugged into a tea urn. Well since chemo on Tues I have only had 3 cups of caffeinated tea as it just doesn't taste the same, boo boo. I have got a liking for Tetley's lemon tea, so am not going without hot drinks. Today I feel a bit grot but have still managed to put tea in the slow cooker, so am not feeling too sick. I am taking all tablets given me plus the maxalon. Sorry for the long post but just needed to share. I do so like this forum as you always feel as though you are not alone.  Thanks for the support  Liz xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone,  I was wondering if anyone could help. I don't see my breast care nurse for the first meetung until the 17th June. (I am away at the present in our caravan) My results have come in the post which I picked up on a quick visit home. After reading it I think that I am looking at a triple negative breast cancer. The result is er: 0/8. Pr 0/8, Ki-67 :50% and HER2 1+ negative. Please could anyone enlighten me, just a yay or nay would be sufficient thanks. Last time I saw the consultant she said I would have lumpectomy follwed by chemo followed by radiotherapy. I don't want to research it on the internet as I think I would frighten myself too much lol.  Thanks in advance xx",
