      "Content": "Morning ladies. After 2 horrible months, I am finally starting treatment tomorrow.Â  I will have 4x EC and 12x Taxol/Carbo and was wondering if anyone has experience with this lovely cocktail? I have tried to read and prepare myself, but still feel utterly uninformed and scared. It's a strange feeling isn't it, you feel absolutely healthy but you know you'll get more and more poorly from the moment they start 'treating' you.. Any tips for the first cycle? I still haven't decided if I should try the cold cap... I can't imagine enduring it for 16 cycles and I have fine hair as well. It doesn't seem to work for most? Would you bother if you had 16 cycles ahead of you? I also have the port op scheduled for Friday, which I thought was quite ambitious. This scares me more than the mastectomy! They are giving me the option of a GA or local/sedation. Any thoughts?",

      "Content": "Hi Maggiemee. You try so hard to prepare yourself but then suddenly the moment is here and you feel utterly unprepared. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience, I am grateful for every tip and detail! Even though the port op scares me, I feel reassured it's the right thing to do, because I know I wouldn't last through a minimum of 32 pokes! I also think I am going to try the cold cap today... at least I'll have tried and know if it's bearable or not. You have 7 more sessions to go. You are nearly there! All the best to you and thanks again xx",
