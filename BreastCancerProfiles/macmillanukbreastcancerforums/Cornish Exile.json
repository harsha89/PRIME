    "Content": "Last November, following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, I had an operation called a 'hookwire therapeutic mammoplasty' which is a kind of lumpectomy and cosmetic reduction all-in-one. In a couple of months time, I will go back to see the surgeon to discuss the pros and cons of having a reduction to my other breast and I would like to hear from anyone who went down this route and whether it is was a success or otherwise. There is a considerable difference between the size of my two breasts and I know that from an aesthetic point of view I will look and feel more feminine (not to mention being able to wear a proper fitting bra!) but I can't help feeling that at the end of the day the operation is not clinically necessary.",
