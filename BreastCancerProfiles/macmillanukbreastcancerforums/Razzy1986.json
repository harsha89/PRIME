    "Content": "Hi, Diagnosed at 28 with BC, my partner (who's now my Husband!) were hoping to have a baby once wed. He already has three amazing children from a previous relationship, however we still wanted one of our own. I chose not to freeze eggs/ embryos prior to treatment because my chemo was very quickly arranged after diagnosis. It was also my only time to feel 'normal' just before chemo, I didn't want to be back and forth to the hospital in that time, particularly in London. Also had the politics of him having 50% say in what happened to the embryos if we were to split- something we didn't want to be thinking about seeing as we were due to marry 3 months later! During this treatment of BC, I also found out I was BRCA1...meaning I had up to 60% chance of developing ovarian cancer too. As a result, and with advice from surgeons, I opted to have a bilateralsalpingo-oopherectomy- my ovaries and Fallopian tubes eyre removed. I do still have my womb, so can carry a baby all being well with testing. However, because my husband has three children, they won't help on the NHS. We kind of came to the conclusion that having children 'wasn't mean to be' for us, but now 3 years down the line, I am feeling strong enough to explore my options (at least, I think I am!) I am hoping to explore this more with my oncologist and surgeon to see if I can find answers. It has always been my dream to have a child of my own. Â  Any advice and support would be great",
