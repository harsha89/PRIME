      "Content": "Hi I'm new here, I found a lump in my breast & under my arm pit, been to breast clinic doctor had a feel about & said don't think it's much to worry about but sent me to have some tests so had mammogram ultrasound & biopsy, went back into doctor who then told me my lump was suspicious & that she'd like to send me for a ct scan & bone scan, also there was a nurse present who said make sure you bring someone with you when you return for results. The doctor left the room & nurse continued to talk about members of the team & that I was high priority, she then gave me a information sheet, she said I needed some bloods taken so said she'd send in the other nurse, I then broke down cause it all got complicated I had gone on my own. What I'm worrying about is I think they know that it could be the C word otherwise why have the scans done before the biopsy results? I could be completely wrong, has anyone else had a similar experience to this? I must however point out that the clinic was very very good & I was seen quickly & all the staff were excellent ",
