    "Content": "Last Tuesday I found out my pathology results and I require no further treatment. My breast cancer remained DCIS. Two and a half weeks on and I am so pleased with how my implant looks, the scar is fantastic and I feel great. It has now made me think about having my other side reconstructed after fourteen years. I would like to thank again my wonderful medical team, family and friends. I would say to any ladies taking on this life challenge is keep informed, take every step as it comes and if considering an implant go for it. I am certainly happier with my new version than my old. Finally I am so glad I was introduced to this website, inspiring and supportive. Thank you.",
