    "Content": "Hello all, I was diagnosed with BC stage 2, early October, 2017.  It was a shock, of course and the fear factor threw me into a downward spiral.  However, I had a lump, less than 1cm, removed and lymph nodes are all clear.  Tissue surrounds are healthy and show no C cells.  I see the radiologist soon, as they want me to have a course of treatment for 3 weeks.  I was also given drugs to take for five years.  Considering that the area is free and healthy, I've decided to forego radio and also don't want to be tied to taking drugs for five years or more, especially considering the side effects involved.  I don't see the point of further treatment for such a small tumour, or having radio on healthy tissue.  I told the surgeon who, got very aggressive and coercive, which surprised me!  He told me he would have given me a mastectomy if he'd known, that I would turn down further treatment.  I reminded him that he couldn't do this without my permission and that it was my life, my body and my decision.  He left the room.   I reckon, the tumour started when I hit the menopause, over a year ago, as its Oestrogen reactive.  So, either I live my life free of treatment and if said cancer cells start again, it would take a good few years develop into life threat.  Or I can go ahead with treatment, feeling trapped and miserable for my remaining life.  I'm eating organic produce only and free range meats, as I'm convinced pesticides arent good for us.  I'm also seeking alternative therapies, which are gentle and feel right for me. I realise that the choices I've made aren't for everyone, just wanted to air my views and wonder if any of you have considered other options?",
