    "Content": "I also have problem. When I bought a chillow it made the nights so much better. My GP also prescribed mild anti-depressants and the have helped. My problem is mainly the Arimidex gives me lots of aches and pains in my arms and legs. I think I am working my way through all the side effects. The only I have not had is loss of appitie and I could do with some of that, Do try a chillow. I still get then in the day time but have found a glass of cold water as it starts helps. Sorry to say I have been on Arimidex for 2 years and the flushes still continue.",
