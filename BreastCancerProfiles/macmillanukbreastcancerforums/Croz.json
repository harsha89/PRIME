      "Content": "Hi All, I'm emailing on behalf of my 62 yr old mum. She is going through a very difficult time at the moment .In April this year, my step dad died of lung cancer (all very sudden and very quick) The day after his death, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. As you can imagine, its been tough. Initially, she had a lumpectomy and was told radiotherapy plus hormone pills would be all (I think she is ER positive) However, they have since confirmed she is HER2 positive. As most of you know, this would mean chemo in order to reduce chances of reoccurrence. She has yet to decide if she is going to ahead with chemo (doctors have told her it will be  3month chemo ,  every week then Herceptin for a year plus radiotherapy and hormones for 5 yrs) Given her mental state and little knowledge on chemo (I too do not have a lot of info) I wondered whether any of you could provide some advice? She also suffers from ulcerative colitis and we do not know if chemo will aggravate it. Can anyone advise where she can get some support? She has contacted the hospital and is going to speak to the Macmillan nurse but I think she needs more help. I am living with her but cant be there full time as my work is very busy. Friends and family do not live locally so cant be there all the time either. I really worry about her mental state and I know she is eager to build a network of people around her. She is naturally very social and positive! Thanks xx",
