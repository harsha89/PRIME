    "Content": "Hi Val I have appendix cancer, which is being treated as a bowel cancer, and I was wondering the same thing, but in relation to chemotherapy. I asked the same question on another forum. I got mixed replies - some said to go easy on antioxidants, but others said that some could enhance the effect of chemo or radiotherapy. There seems to be some thinking that natural anti-oxidants - found in fruit, mushrooms, green tea etc are ok - whereas commercially produced antioxidant supplements are less beneficial. But the answer is that I don't know - so what I plan to do in my second round of chemo is to eat antioxidant foods - but in moderation. As Ansi stated above, they probably won't make much difference to the effectiveness of the radio or chemo. Below is a link to a page from Cancer Research UK website which discusses the issue: http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/about/harm/the-safety-of-vitamins-and-diet-supplements Take care Poppy",
