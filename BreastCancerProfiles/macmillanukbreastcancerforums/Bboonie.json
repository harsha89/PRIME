No deodorant or talc.  Lots of water to drink.  No hot water on the affected area,  no rubbing with a towel only gently patting.  In fact I used the cool setting on my hair dryer to dry the skin, more gentle than a towel.  Lots of good healthy food to eat,  your body will use up more energy during rads, I used to eat a banana straight after rads, supposed to be a good energy food.  My daughter came with me to each appointment with my 2 year old grandson. My grandson Theo and I enjoyed our snack of banana and a bottle of water routine.  Hope it goes ok Marian",

I had my mastectomy September 09, followed by 6 FEC-T chemo, 25 rads and I am halfway through 18 herceptin.  Its been a long difficult journey, but do I regret any of it NO WAY.  I would rather throw everything at the cancer now and not live to regret it later.  I was terrified not with the mastectomy but with the chemo.  I burst into tears when I was signing the consent form for the chemo.  But although it was very difficult, the time passed very quickly.  At least I know I have given it my all, if it comes back I could have not have done anymore. It is normal to be terrified, but I wanted to live more than I was frightened of the treatment. I am longing for March 2011, for the end of herceptin and the end of my active treatment. But in the meantime I am back to work full time and putting life back on track.  The time really does go quickly. Good luck Marian",

      "Content": "Hi Noj I had 3 FEC, 3 TAX.  I have currently had 1 dose out of 18 of Herceptin.  The veins in my \"good\" started to play up on the 2nd dose of FEC.  The senior nurse in the Chemo Day Unit spoke to me then about whether I wanted to have a PICC line or a port fitted or continue as I was with my veins.  She spoke to both my hubby and me at length about the pros and cons of both.  She explained that she was able to insert the PICC line but it was outside the body and she spoke about how to look after it.  She then explained the Port was inside the body so once inserted there were less restrictions, but did involve an operation under local and I would be left with 2 small scars. Also it would require an operation to remove it, also it would require very carefull handling when using it and needs to be flushed out every 3/4 weeks even if not in use.  I was given leaflets to take home to thinks about it.  Once we had made our choice the operation was arrange very quickly, I could have had it done before FEC 3, but I couldn't do the date given, but was done before chemo number 4.  It has been much better for me than the constant warming and slapping of my arm in order to get a good vein.  I have always been offered and given local anaesthetic to put on the port before use as it can be a little bit painfull on insertion and removal of the port needle (I am also a woos with pain).  The information both written and verbal was excellent.  Must add that all my treatment and information given by the doctors and nurses at the hospital has been excellent and with fault, its not often you can say that about a hospital.  ",

      "Content": "Hi JBert I am half way through my 18 doses of herceptin which is following 6 FEC.  The first dose of herceptin is given over 90mins so they can watch to see if you have any side effects.  The next 3/4 doses are slowly decreased until you get to 30 mins.  I have had 2 doses at 30mins as I did not have any side effects.  You will have a special heart scan before you start called a MUGA.  This will be repeated at regular intervals during the year to check on your heart.  Herceptin can reduce how your heart works, it can affect about 20%.  The other side effects you can get are a lot less than chemo, the main side effects are the heart problems,flu-like symptoms and fatigue (although the fatigue is not as bad as chemo fatigue).  It seems to slow down hair growth, so my hair is growing more slowly and it makes your nails very fragile and they break more easily.  But compared to chemo a walk in the park.  Good luck with your treatment - the treatment seems very long but once you get onto herceptin the nasty chemo side effects go and it doesn't seem so bad Marian xx",

      "Content": "HI muriel Anne I work for the NHS.  The PCT may not cover the cost of an operation to remove healthy tissue.  If the lumpectomy has ben successful I doubt if they will sanction another operation to remove that breast.  As for removal of the healthy breast. I believe that only ladies that carry the hereditary breast cancer gene can have an NHS mastectomy of a healthy breast.  The hereditary gene is normally checked out when breast cancer is diagnosed in several close blood relatives whilst they are under 50.  As an example Bernie Nolan, 2 of her sisters have diagnosed with it she was checked and does not carry the gene. It is unusually for the NHS to sanction operations on healthy tissue or limbs unless there is conclusive evidence to support it. If you had asked for a mastectomy when you had your operation instead of a lumpectomy it is probable that this would have been allowed, but unusual for a mastectomy to do done after a lumpectomy unless there is proof of no clear margins or it comes back. Having both breast removed does not neccesarily guarantee that it will not spread.  If it is going to spread it can spread to your lover, kidney, bones, lungs or brain and yet leave the remaining breast cancer free.  This disease is unpredicatable, and the best we can do is put our faith in the professionals and get on with our lives. We all worry about the future and will it spread, but we have to find away of living with the fear and not letting it spoil our lives now.  It is not easy but time helps.  I was diagnosed in August 2009, I had a left mastectomy, 6 chemo, 25 rads and I am currently on herceptin (in between I had a portacath put in).  It is a long, long tough journey, but I trust my surgeon and my oncologist and I enjoy life and I live for the moment and I am beginning to plan for the future.  New grandchild due Feb 2011 and my daughter is getting married April 2011 so lots of look forward to Don't let it rule your life more than it has too Marian",

      "Content": "HI Fran Sorry you have had to joint us on here.  I can't help with the cold cap as I chose not to use it.  By personal choice I decided not to use it.  It is strangely very liberating to lose your hair.  I got my wig before chemo and had my hair cut short 1 week after my 1st chemo.  In fact losing my hair was not as big a deal as I thought it would be. I have a portacath.  I will be having extended IV treatment as I have had 6 FEC-T and I am now half way through 12 herceptin.  I had my 1st chemo via the veins in my hand that was ok, by the 2nd chemo they had virtually packed up, took 4 hours to find a usable vein.  Had portacath put in 2 weeks later.  I would definately say try using your own veins first, in most ladies it works very well for the 6 or 8 chemos.  I also understand from this forum that not all hospitals do ports. I am very lucky mine does, all the chemo nurses here are experienced in using them.  I had my last chem in Feb and my hair is coming back, much darker than before and much thicker than before.  It is still very short and I understand Herceptin can make hair growth slower, so short hair for a bit longer.  I wear a mixture of my wig and hats/scarves.  I don't mind the hats/scarves options they are cooler in the sun and you can get a good variety of colours and styles.  I like to co-ordinatemine with my clothes.  My work collegues think my hats/scarves are better than my wig!!  Good luck with your treatment - it can be daunting, but it is do able love Marian xxxx  ",

      "Content": "I have 3 young grandchildren, 3, 2 and nearly 1.  I see the 3 and 2 year old nearly every day.  My daughter (their mum) told the 3 yr old that I had had an operation on my arm ( I had a mastectomy and lymph node removal).  I bought a plastic band (like the charity ones)from an Australia website that has an alert on it about no needles or blood pressure.  I wear this when I see them and she thinks it is helping to make my arm better and also remindsher to be careful around that arm. It really does work.  When my hair started to fall out we had told her that the hospital had given me very strong medicine that you cannot get from the doctor to make my arm better but mademy hair fall out.  She accepted it. My daughter informed her nursery teacher of the situation and she openly talked to them about my hair, telling them I had baby hair when it was falling out and got very thin and patchy.  I sometime wear hats/scarves and sometimes a wig.  She likes me to wear brightly coloured scarves and she like to wear clothes that match me.  We have had great fun matching our colours, it helps brighten up my day.  My hair is just starting to grow back, and she tells me now to grow it long like hers.  She has me tying my scarfs so as to leave a long tail at the back so that we can pretend i have long hair.  The 2 year old takes it all in his stride and gives me a quizzical look when he sees me without any head covering then wanders off and carrys on as normal.  Kids are a lot more accepting than we as adults are.  Just don't give them any doom and gloom and they will help to brighten up your life .",
