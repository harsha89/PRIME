      "Content": "Friends make some stupid comments Friend- on discovering I was to have chemo and probably have hair loss - there are some lovely wigs around which look better than most women's hair.  You could look very glamorous.   Friend on hearing I was to have silicone implant after my surgery - my God, my breast implants cost a fortune and you are having yours for free A work colleague on hearing my diagnosis - you'll be retiring now.  When will you leave?  A friend - you'll be able to leave work now on health grounds.   The work related comments could knock your confidence, especially as I have worked through most of my treatment, and after a short spell away hope to return next month.   Anne x ",

      "Content": "Hi Cartwheels, I have cold capped throughout FEC which was hard but after first 10 minutes I got distracted and it went well.   Now done 2 on T and found it was easier as less time on the machine.  Fortunately I didn't lose much hair and glad I persevered.   Best wishes with your treatment Anne X ",
