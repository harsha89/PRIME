      "Content": "Hi All, I had a lumpectomy and 2 sentinal nodes removed in June, due to one node having one c cell and margins founds to have c cells, I had a mastectomy and a further 11 nodes removed (all of which were clear). I was advised that the cancer had gone but was advised to have 6 rounds Â of Chemo-Fec-T and 15 rounds of Radiotherapy as a precaution, Chemo has now finished and my radio starts on 9th Jan, my concern is that the Oncologist says that due to only one node being affected and the other 12 being clear I only need radio on my breast area and not on my nodes, but I feel so worried that I'm not having the radio on the node area, has anyone else been through the same thing?.",
