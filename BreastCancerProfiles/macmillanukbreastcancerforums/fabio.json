      "Content": "Jacky well done you..... But remember you will have had to go through Version 1 and come out the other side to fully understand and appreciate Version 2 How can we understand/feel Joy without feeling sadness first. It is impossible to feel happiness, gratitude, love, humility etc.   without going through sadness, hatred, lost love, pretension etc.   Heather77 thank you for your kind words. I am sending you positive energy and healing for your journey ahead.....take each day as it comes and live in the now.....lap up the good times/feelings that will carry you through the hard times ahead and try and appreciate all very small thing we take for granted daily.

      "Content": "Oh my where do I begin with the wonderful gifts that cancer has brought into my life. My best friend couldn't cope with my diagnosis and left my life....but silver lining I see her now as the victim role she played .....it's amazing how cancer make you look at situations differently and it's like a wake up call ...............you place your energy in stuff that makes your heart sing as you haven't got the energy for negativity and stuff that is draining.....so she left my life and made room for some wonderful people I would have never met and are like family, so I actually need to thank her for the void that has been filled with positive helpful people. I left my very high powered very stressful national executive role to focus on my hobbies ....which was very difficult and I went through a mourning process ( took a year) as I left all my great colleagues as well and my social life ( worked away from home)  My job became who I identified myself as.... which was  a false self. I had studied/worked hard to get there and it was hard to give up, plus the luxury lifestyle it gave me and my family. In my past life (re cancer)  I never thought about my next breath and never lived in the 'NOW' it was always about future target setting/reaching and very hurried and rushed. There was never enough time and at weekends I couldn't enjoy my family as I was so burnt out and that bought it's own problems!! I remember small things like checking the weather and complaining if it was raining or too hot as I was always travelling to get to some meeting never being grateful for being alive.....and having no gratitude for anything as everything could have been better......my staff could have done more....the food/service in the restaurant could have been better....my children could have got better exam results .....all driven by my need to be/get better and strive to be the best that I could be and the best way to show that I had arrived to the world was by having a high flying job title the name badge and salary to go with it. So along came cancer to show me who is 'Boss' AKA my diagnosis which stopped me in my tracks and showed me that the path I was following was false and going to kill me if I dint change my priorities . I have spent the last year finding who the real me is and stripped away all my 'ego' and I love the new humble me and the grateful me. I was chasing what society values to fit in/ and not what I wanted/needed. I practice Gratitude every day and what I am grateful for and the simplest of things that I took for granted thing like My :- My next breath My Health The NHS My digestive system (I had stage 4 colon cancer diagnosed Dec 11) Waking up each and every morning. My wonderful husband (took him for granted, we have become closer) The deep love I have for my boys Nature My new found friends My reconciled family (estranged after the death of my father over inheritance) Thanks for starting this great thread. What are the small things you take for granted? Maria . ",
