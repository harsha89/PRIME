      "Content": "Hi Libby   I suffer with claustrophobia ,so bad I cant go in a lift, get on the underground and numerous other things without having a panic attack so I know how you feel. When I was told by the consultant that I had to have an MRI, CT and PET scan my stomach turned somersaults. I only agreed to the MRI provided I went in feet first, and I also took some Diazepam. Anyway it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought, , Honestly the CT scan is really nothing to worry about because its not a long tunnel like the MRI. . Its not at all claustrophobic, believe me . If you still feel nervous ask your GP for some Diazepam. Not sure that it really helped me all that much but I only took a small amount because I don't like to feel drowsy.  The planning is a very necessary part of the radiotherapy treatment so that they target the  correct area to be treated.  I never thought I would cope with it all, but then I never thought that I would have this horrid disease. I have now received the all clear ,So good luck and try not to worry.   Valerie",

      "Content": "I had chemo/radiotherapy for anal cancer. The chemo was supposed to only make my hair thin but I actually lost a lot at the back of my head where it rubbed on my pillow. Any way I digress, I finished my treatment in Nov 2013 and like you my hair grew through white, Well to be truthful it may have already been white but after years of dying it I couldn't be sure. I am a little bit older than you, well 20 years to be precise 71) but I used to look in the mirror and think to myself who is that old lady looking back at me. I saw my oncologist in February and asked about dying my hair, she said it would be fine to do so, I immediately went and bought a home dye took it to my daughter in law who is a hairdresser .  She trimmed the remaining hair and put the colour on.  What a difference it made . now andother 3 months on my hair is growing through nicely but curly. I have never had curls so its taking a bit of getting used to.   Obviously I can only speak for myself and think that maybe you could contact your oncologist or specialist nurse for advice. Believe me you will feel great when you get rid of the white hair. Good luck Valerie   .  ",

      "Content": "just high jacking your post, (I'm on Anal cancer) because I know exactly how you feel, I am dreadfully claustrophobic, don't do lifts, cant sit in the back of 2 door cars, or the underground system. I nearly had a panic attack on the spot when my consultant mentioned an MRI scan. I only agreed to it provided I could go in feet first together with a valium . I've managed to have two scans so far in this way and just kept my eyes tight shut. Still don't like it but it has to be done. Am I correct in assuming you were on your front, and if so this must  be more uncomfortable that on your back ,as I was. I really feel for you and wish you all the best,  No one knows what its like to be claustrophobic . only another sufferer can truly understand the horrible panicky feeling. Take care and good luck    Valerie ",
