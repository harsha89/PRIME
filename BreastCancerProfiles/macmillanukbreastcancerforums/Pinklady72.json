    "Content": "Hi, I used the cold cap and managed to keep my hair, it went thinner but anyone who didn't know me wouldn't have had a clue. I used Dr Organics shampoo and conditioner that I got from Holland and Barrett as this was what my chemotherapy nurses told me to get. They also put the conditioner on my dry hair before they put on the cold cap. Although I was told not to, I gently washed my hair everyday, blow dried it and used straighteners sometimes too. I figured if it was going to come out then so be it, and if I couldn't have washed it and sorted it out each morning then I would have had to have worn a headscarf anyway!! I know I was lucky with my hair and wish you lots of luck with your treatment (and your hair!) xx",
