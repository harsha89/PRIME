    "Content": "Rosie1947 I am 69 and in good health. Take no medication whatsoever. I had lumpectomy surgery for breast cancer about 3 weeks ago. Tumour was 3.5 cm and Surgeon removed all lymph nodes, only one of which had been infected. My nipple was removed. That doesn't bother me. Slight cording, but making vast improvement with exercise. I have had no pain or discomfort whatsoever and no 'after effects'. Grade 3. IDC. ER 8. PR5. Consultant very pleased. Been told that next step/s wiil be radiotherapy, Letrozole and Bisophosonates. Meds for 10 years. These worry me far more than the actual operation. Any form of medication, other than the occasional paracetamol, scares me rigid. There are so many side effects, more tabs prescribed to counteract this and it goes on and on. I'lI be meeting with Oncologist in 10 days to discuss way forward. Whilst I will go with an open mind and prepared to weigh up pros and cons, I'm really leaning towards declining treatment, particular medication. I have, and want to continue to have, a good quality of life, not hampered by side effects of meds etc. I am a widow, have no family (other than my cats) but several good friends and do voluntary work, fundraising etc. Has anyone been in similar situation?Â  i.e. declined further treatment after op and if their decision was the right/wrong one. I understand everyone's situation is different and decisions are personal, but it would be helpful to know your thoughts in general.",
