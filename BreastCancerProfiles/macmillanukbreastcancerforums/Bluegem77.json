      "Content": "Hi everyone, I took tamoxifen for 3 months following lumpectomy and radiotherapy for bc.  I was ok the first few weeks but then the side effects started kicking in.  They were really unbearable especially the headaches, relentless hot flushes and feeling fluey all the time not to mention the dry itchy skin and dry eyes.  I saw my consultant nearly a month ago and asked if I could have a break from taking them as I  had a lot of things going on in my life like splitting with my partner and moving house.  He did not advise taking a break so I asked him what my survival chances were with taking tamoxifen v not taking it.  He tapped a few details into the computer such as my age, type and size of tumour etc.  With a broad smile on his face he handed me the printout with the results and it showed that in my case the benefits of taking tamoxifen were 0.9% (less than 1%) difference compared with not taking it.  Considering the side effects of tamoxifen and the risks of other diseases, with those odds I did not hesitate for long, I came off it. So,  for those women who are finding the side effects of Tamoxifen as unbearable as I was, it may be worth finding out what the odds are in your own case. Obviously, no one should ever stop taking it without professional advice and I realize that this drug does save a lot of lives but in my case, it was just not worth taking.  I wish I had thought to find out more about the statistical benefits so that I could have made an informed choice but I just accepted that it would be part of my treatment plan.  I am still suffering hot flushes nearly 4 weeks after stopping it but hopefully as time passes the severity and frequency will diminish.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am due my first checkup in a month.  Had 2cm invasive ductal ca treated with lumpectomy end Jan 2013 followed by 20 sessions radiotherapy.  My breast has always been sore especially around the scar site and also get stabbing pains which my consultant knows about and said is normal.  I am worried about my first checkup which is due next month; not so much for the outcome, although of course that is always worrying, but more because I cannot bear the thought of a mammogram on the cancer breast.  The very thought makes my eyes water, it is still so sore and tender.  I found the original mammogram quite painful before I had the diagnosis and treatment and so its going to be worse this time.  Is there any other alternative to a mammogram?  Has anyone else had this problem at their first checkup? Thanks for reading, hugs to everyone x                                                    ",
