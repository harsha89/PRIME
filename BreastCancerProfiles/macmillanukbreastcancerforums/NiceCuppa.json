Better to have a fab holiday abroad at the end to celebrate. Also you are probably already aware but have to be very careful in the sun when on chemo.",

I have finished that one now and supposed to be moving on to x3 EC next. The rude nurse told me rather flippantly  that I will be like this for al my chemos.  I don't feel like I am doing very well at the moment. I stupidly thought I would just get my head down and get through it with minimum fuss..like deciding that would stop anything bad from happening. I am clearly am idiot",

Used to do? I am on sick leave. I am going back to work. I may be broken but somewhere underneath all of this poop I am still me... I think.  It was just another thing that made me cry (I don't do crying so I know I am broken). I felt like she was saying well you know you are never going back to work. You've had it!  I am sure it wasn't meant like this and this nurse just has zero people skills but when you feel like hell and struggling with who you are and what place you have in your families life (I feel like I am just a constant hindrance at the moment) this was the final straw. Like I said you all probably think I am being oversensitive and I am sure once I feel better! I will think the same but at the moment I am utterly terrified of setting foot anywhere near that hospital",

Don't want to scare the kids and partner quite frankly is extremely stressful to live with at the moment (Not his fault he has a lot going on but difficult to take the brunt of it when I feel so hellish) I am finding it easier not to respond to people now when they ask how I am as I get told, well it's saving your life (yep that's magic that, I will instantly feel better now!) Or when I get upset about losing my hair I get, oh well you knew it was going to happen. Does that make it any easier to deal with then?! Although to be honest there are very few people that bother to contact me now or even send a hello thinking of you message. Probably because they are not thinking of me and have their own lives to lead. But that means the friends who stick with me are true friends so have to be happy about that.",

It seems to keep coming and going. All very odd. I was told that EC would cause me more mouth problems and sores etc so trying to brush teeth after eating absolutely anything! Horsing Around yes I was put on emend and ondansetron anti sickness but now finished them. Sorry to hear you have been sick with it. How are you now? I have had sickness queasy feeling through all 4 chemos so far. Are you having 6 rounds in total? I have 2 left after this current one. Also thinking I may take some ortis now to try and get bowels moving. Legs aren't hurting as much on EC as they did with doxatecal.  Ijust keeping everything crossed ! No the oncologist did not have time to see me before the day of my chemo and I didn't have energy to call private bods etc so just went with the flow. I just want chemo to be over and done with now. I also decided to wait 're counselling and instead going to do something prior to returning to work so I can see how I can deal with anxiety,  expectations on me at home and work etc. I have seen a place that is not at the hospital but is for cancer patients so that is ideal as they will hopefully get where I am coming from. Hope everyone is doing ok and apologies for not responding  sooner. Haven't been sleeping but not had focus to reply but have read responses. You are all so fab and supportive and I really appreciate  all your kind words.",

For first three chemo (docetexal) and thought I had got away with getting them with EC. But sure enough a week after chemo they started last night as soon as I tried doing anything...walking around, emptying washing machine, just any movement other than just lying or sitting on sofa. And sure enough today as soon as I start to do anything it starts. Am I alone with these? Or is anyone else experiencing them? I don't normally get them.this late after chemo.  I am wondering what the hell causes them.  Hope everyone gets some sleep tonight.

I think if i experience this when I am not on the blood thinning injections then I will have to speak to the nurse / oncologist but keeping everything crossed  Thanks once again xxxx",

      "Content": "This thread is brilliant! In the last two days I have been told: , \"well at least you have had your children\" (I am being put through early menopause after chemo) By a cancer nurse \"breast cancer is the best one to have\"....Really? I know that there has been a lot of research into BC etc but since when should I feel grateful for having cancer I had a friend visit me and her well meaning but crap advice to me on how if I had a different diet it may have prevented cancer. For the record I eat very healthily and cook from scratch. She is the type of person that frowned when I pour cows milk in my tea! She then insisted she was going to send me lots of recipes to change my diet and I said, do what you like but I won't be using them, I will be using the macmillan cancer cook book if I use anything! (I am afraid i got a bit cross, if I hear take turmeric one more time i will scream...) On having chemo...well at least you will save money on haircuts and highlights. Or at least you can wear a wig On losing your pubic hair..at least it will save you having to shave and going for waxes I have even been told that I am too young for cancer...someone had better tell the consultant then! I know it's difficult not just for the person who has cancer but for their friends and family and sometimes people don't know what to say, and it's coming from a good place, just their messages that aren't quite right or as supportive as they think!",

Back when they thought my cancer was DCIS I had planned to have my op and work through radiotherapy. Best laid plans and all that as 6 months on 2 operations, stage 3 cancer , chemo and now radiotherapy I am in absolutely no position to work whilst undergoing radiotherapy despite what my boss wants. They will have to wait. I have got really scared about returning to work and quite frankly terrified as to how I am going to manage. I Am thinking I may give myself 2 to 4 weeks after radiotherapy finishes before I go back to work. After all I have not actually been well since the first op and to rush back may actually be false economy  for everyone if I end up Ill/ having a breakdown.  Sounds like we are in same boat 're having to work full time.  I think you are a day ahead of me with chemo so I hope you are feeling better today. My throat is on fire but hoping the antibiotics and antifungal meds kick in soon. I only have 5 days of steroids after chemo but never took them after 4.30pm to try and help me with sleep. But am having hot flushes all the time so not had any sleep for a few months now.  Xx",

It's had its ups and downs, docetexal was the worst for me, EC has been better although it has well and truly knackered my veins. Feeling so tired. Used to be bouncing back by middle of week 2 now it's week 3 and even then not quite right. Good luck to those of you starting or on the chemo train. You can do it. Horsing Around, what is next for you? I have 19 rounds of radiotherapy ahead and then I suppose back to work which will be very odd indeed. I can't afford to go back part time so may just use my accumulated annual leave to work a 4 day week or something! xxx",

Although in my head I have told myself if I am back by beginning of July then that will be ok. Yep have mouthwashes etc but not doing much good. Had 2 bowls of icecream this am already! Also have the painful lumps back in my chemo arm. GP and oncologist and chemo unit didn't know what it was last time and didn't seem to care that I had painful lumps app wearing in my arm..convinced it is chemo related as appears approx a week after chemo Yep get on waiting list for acupuncture.  I am still not sure if I believe in acupuncture but if it makes you feel better doesn't really matter.

I may not have told you all I had a lump in my arm and it was qui tte painful at my penultimate chemo. GP, chemo line and onco  didn't know what it was and none of them investigated so I feel let down by them. I had a suspicion at the time it was a blood clot. I should have trusted my instincts as a few days after my last chemo it started again and then became very hot and swollen. Luckily I decided after a few days to call them because it turns out it's blood clots so now I have 6 weeks of injections and different antibiotics and meantime I am in agony and going to have to get taxis to hospital costing me a small fortune.  So lesson learned if you think it is something just say it and ask them why not. If I had of done this I might not be in so much pain now. I will always  always question Drs and nurses now.  And finally a hair related question. I cold capped but have no hair on top and towards back of head. At the moment I am.still washing it couple of times a week max. I know.we are all different but when does hair start to come.back after chemo and when should I start washing hair as normal? Any ideas anyone? Have a lovely Sunday everyone xx",

It's totally understandable that you are so frightened.  It's worth checking out the monthly chemo thread.  Chemo is different for everyone. I have had a bad week but unknown next week will be better and by week 3 back to normal (whatever that is!). However some people are just fine and dandy and some even work through chemo.  There are lots of drugs available nowadays that means your mum does not have to suffer. I was terrified about sickness but they give you anti sickness tablets. Your mum will be given a 24 hour chemo line to call whilst she is going through treatment and they are only a phone call away. I am sure someone else will be along in the morning with much better well written advice that I cannot think of at this time in the AM :-) Xxx",
