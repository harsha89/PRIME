    "Content": "Hi I was put on Anastrozaole and after 2 weeks had the first period I had had in 18 months. My oncologist had thought I was post-menopausal but then accepted I still had activity in my ovaries whichhad been triggered by the medication so took me off Anastrozole and put me on Tamoxifen. Now I don't know whether I am pre, peri or post menopausal and whether or not I will have any more periods or not. Very inconvenient from a family planning perspective and I am now getting hot flushes again :( I hope you get answers to your questions and in time I will expect to get an answer for mine!",
