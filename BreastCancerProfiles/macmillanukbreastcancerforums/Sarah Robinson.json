      "Content": "I was diagnosed last month and had wide local excision of a tumour in my right breast 4days ago. I think I'm still in shock. I've looked at a few threads, don't understand a lot of the language/knowledge that people have. I'm still suffering the pain of this op, dealing with having no nipple, a radically different breast, and the knowledge that after radiotherapy, I'm going to have to have the other breast \"matched\", and go through all this pain again. I know I'm incredibly fortunate that my lymph nodes are clear, and I don't need chemo, but I'm a mess. I have well meaning people throwing all sorts of \"options\" at me, from arnica to thermography (whatever that is), and I feel completely bewildered. All around me are focussing on the fact that the cancer hasn't spread, and I obviously want to reassure my children, (18 and 16) so I can't dissolve in a sweaty mess, but I can't seem to look outside where I am. I can't describe properly how I feel in words, just lost, diminished, helpless. Can anyone help?",

      "Content": "Hi Jacky I can't tell you what it's like to have someone NOT being relentlessly positive! I don't mean your post has brought me down, quite the opposite, but there's so much pressure to keep my chin up, look on the bright side, keep smiling etc etc and I feel like I'm letting people down. Just to know that it's not completely mad to look at my breast and think, \"that's not mine\" is helpful. And yes, losing my nipple was the slap in the face. Thank you for the virtual hugs, I'm sending one back (but not too tight). And I hope that the work situation improves, you need to be supported, not disregarded. Xx",
