      "Content": "Hi all Just thought I would update you re my experience of R1&R2.  After several conversations with different gp's at my practice it was eventually prescribed, not without me becoming very tearful I will admit and I still think the doctor was unhappy to let me have it. Yesterday i finished my 15 sessions, post mx with a jelly pad, and apart from a slight pink rectangle my skin has held up really well, in fact the radiographer was surprised it was so good! I have no idea if it would have been the same with E45 (that's what my gp wanted me to use) but I'm glad i had a breakdown and got it.  I've used more of the R2 and will continue to until it runs out!  I found R1  a bit messy, especially if I wasn't able to go straight home to put it on, think most of it was absorbed into my clothes. Now feeling a little 'lost', no hospital today! I've just phoned my BC nurse to ask what happens next, I've an oncology appointment in November and a Breast Unit appointment next February but I want to talk about reconstruction (not sure I want it but want to talk about it) and a prosthesis I hate the softie and am using a knitted knocker if I feel the need to be even. Sorry I'm rambling now, have a good day everyone x ",

Taking time out has made me realise that's there's more to life than work and it's also been an interesting journey with friends and relatives, but that's another story.  I'm not sure what happens next, it will be strange not having a diary full of appointments to work round.   Glad you've reached the end  X",

      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi tarneh  The only daft question is the one that isn't asked  Noticed you are taking Tamoxifen - Your friend must be post menopause and is taking either Letrozole, Anastrozole or Exemstane as her ovaries won't be producing the oestrogen? Those types of tablet can cause bone thinning which can lead to osteopaenia and a Dexa scan checks bone density to keep an eye on this. They perform the first scan before starting the tablets to get base line figures, then again after 6 months or so to see if they are causing any bone density change. You don't get this problem with Tamoxifen so unless they change you to those mentioned above in a couple of years (which they sometimes do) it isn't a concern Hope this help, G n' J Thanks that's the strange thing, she's def not post menopause as until diagnosis she was still taking contraceptive pill and as yet she hasn't been pescribed hormone tablets.  I on the other hand have been told I am almost certainly post menopause, I had a blood test last year as I want to get rid of my coil, but the gp was against it but that's another story.",
