    "Content": "Hi All My Mum was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in December 2018 (Sadly My mum had Colon cancer in November 2013) It was originally thought it was Tripple Negative and My Mum had a Mascetomy on 5th January. During the time from Diagnosis to Surgery Tumour had grown by 25% Mum had surgery and luckily no lymphnodes were involved. They were not sure what treatment to give so it then went to addenbrooks to be looked into. 3 Times we went to hospital for pre arranged appointments  for results to be told they were not ready. (No phone calls to say beforehand and always afternoon appoitments sitting in waiting room so anxious)  Third appointment told tumour would need to go to America for Oxy Test. ( it didnt go to America in the first place as they thought it was Tripple Negative) and they kept saying you will most likely have Hormone tablets and no radiation as it was then found to be Invasive Carcinoma Secretory. Well Yesterday we finally got results and Mum scored 38 and was told mum will need Chemo TC and Radio I am now worried sick that there has been a Delay from having surgery to then getting Chemo  Its bad enough being diagnosed but the waiting is torture. Has anyone experienced this? How long was it from you Having Op to receiving Chemo? Many Thanks Megan ",
