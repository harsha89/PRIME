Welcome to the club, Vickie (although sorry you had to join in the first place!) I was more worried about chemo than surgery too, mainly because I knew I would only need to do surgery once and I would be asleep whilst they got on with it. I was very nervous for my first FEC, but less so for my second. I was also lucky with my FEC side effects. Hope you continue to be. Good luck for tomorrow afternoon! Not sure I'll have time to be online tomorrow morning - got to get my 6 year old ready for a pyjama day at school before I head off to the hospital. So sending you all hugs now. See you on the other side... Caroline xxx",

The first couple of months off work were lovely, but I'm used to being far busier than this during the day. All of my friends and family are working during the day so I'm just whiling away the hours between school runs. Once it gets a bit warmer I'll start going for walks again, but it's too cold and muddy here at the moment. I've managed 15 weeks of chemo and no takeaways/eating out so it seems silly to risk it for my last 3 weeks. I know that you mean about waiting rooms Mo, I caught a cough from the cancer clinic a few weeks ago and became neutropenic. I don't fancy going through that again, hence avoiding the public as much as possible. :) Last chemo next Thursday do I'm nearly there... Caroline x",

I've had a few twinges around the scar line of my lumpectomy, but put that down to an overly tight bra (thanks for the weight gain chemo!). This afternoon I noticed a thin rope like line running along the edge of my arm pit above where I had my lymph nodes removed. It's not the same under my 'normal' arm. I've also noticed that my arm can feel tight sometimes like something is pulling slightly when I stretch it out. Could this be cording? My surgery was back in October and I was doing arm exercises until mid-Feb. If it is cording is there anything I can do to ease it? Thank you! Caroline xx",

      "Content": "Hi June I think you may be in a similar position to me. I found a lump in August and was diagnosed with a Grade 1 cancer in September. The biopsy results showed that there were also signs of cancer in one of my lymph nodes so I was sent for a CT scan and bone scan to see if there was any suspicious cell activity elsewhere in my body.My operation (lumpectomy and complete axillary clearance - removal of all lymph nodes on the affected side) took place in October. It was a day procedure so after being operated on at lunchtime I was home by mid-evening. It's good to have someone with you for 24 hrs after the op to be on the safe side.  Cancer cells were found in 7 of my lymph glands, but it didn't look like the cancer had spread elsewhere. I was told that I would have to have radiotherapy and 5 yrs of tamoxifen because the cancer had gone to my lymph nodes. I was also given the option of FEC-T chemotherapy, more as a preventative measure to decrease the chance of the cancer coming back. I'm currently halfway through chemo. It's not as bad as I imagined it would be and I'm glad I chose to do it. It is scary being diagnosed and waiting for things to happen. It sounds you like you have some good friends though. If what I've said sounds similar to your situation I'm happy to keep in touch to let you know how I've been finding each stage. This forum has been great when I've been worried about things. Take care, Caroline x",

      "Content": "Hi June As mistymoley says it can be just bad luck. It's a massive rollercoaster of emotion when you are first diagnosed. I found that I was shocked (I'd been on a real health kick over the summer and felt great!), devastated and then very angry (quite frankly at 37 I felt too young for cancer!). I've harnessed the anger and turned it into defiance. There is no way this is beating me! Once you've had the op you may feel better. At least the lump will be gone!  I've not noticed any great change to my overall health since the lymph glands were removed. Under my arm is still numb many weeks later and may well stay that way forever. It's not uncomfortable, just feels a bit alien when I spray deodorant there and can't feel it! The only thing I wasn't prepared for after the op was a build up of seroma (fluid like in a blister) 10 days later. It became very uncomfortable and did dampen my spirits, I'd been so pleased I was on the mend. It was drained by my BCN once and then again by my surgeon and since then it's been behaving. I'm taking part in a clinical trial aimed at reducing lymphedema risk. I have a set of exercises and a massage to do twice every day for three months. My arm hasn't shown any sign of lymphedema yet. The important thing after the op is to do the exercises that the hospital recommends. I found that going for walks helped too. It gave me time to think whilst I waited for my first chemo appointment and I felt like I was training myself for the next stage. My surgeon wasn't the most charismatic person I've ever met, but he knew precisely what he was doing. I found that an appointment with the surgeon would be straight to the point. My BCN would then meet me afterwards to go through details more closely and to offer emotional support. Hopefully you will get that too. If you have any questions or worries please do shout! Good luck! Caroline x",

      "Content": "Good luck Stoatie! As everyone has said just follow the advice of the nurses (especially about when is best to take anti-sickness tablets) and listen to your body. Keep an eye of your temps and think about keeping a log of how you feel each day. I found that during FEC it was good to be able to read back over how I had felt to see if there was a pattern and to reassure myself on rubbish days that everything has been fine last time around. You can do this and we'll be here for you! As you say once you get started you are already heading for the finish line! Love Caroline xx",

They got the needle in on the second attempt. On the first go they managed to go right through the vein! :( I only slept for an hour last night because of the steroids so had a snooze at the hospital. How are you, Ali? Not still flying around the hospital, I hope. One more down... :-) aroline xx",

I've had a lovely day looking around Norwich castle and completely forgetting about Thursday's chemo. Starting my steroids tomorrow morning and keeping my fingers crossed that tax is kind to me again this time.  Really pleased to read your good news today! Good luck for Thursday!  Good luck for Friday, Nettie, and good luck to all of the Thursday ladies! One more down... Caroline xx  ",

Hopefully when you see your oncologist on Monday things will seem clearer. If you are worried, need to vent, or just want people to talk to pop onto here. Everyone is friendly and kind and we're all at different stages so there's usually someone that can reassure you about what you are about to go through/are going through. Sending a hug and luck for Monday. Caroline x",
