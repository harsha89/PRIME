    "Content": "My Mum has been having chemo and as a result has lost her eyebrows, so I was thinking about paying to get her permanent eyebrow tattoos for Christmas. She's just had her last session and I was wondering if anyone knows how long you have to wait after her last session until he can had it done? Out of all her hair loss, her lack of eyebrows gets her down, so it would be really nice to cheer her up. Thanks",
