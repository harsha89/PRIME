      "Content": "Hi, I've just joined this site, although i have just had my 5th chemo. I'm having Docitaxel for the last 3 of 6. With this round i have the worst taste in my mouth imaginable, and stomach ache after i eat, followed by a trip to the loo. Not every meal, mornings seem the worst. It's a week since my chemo and this taste is getting unbearable, i can't taste anything i eat. Anyone had the same?",
