    "Content": "Hi Lola please don't be afraid as I was diagnosed January 2011 with stage 4 and two lumps one 12 mm deep and the other 24 I was more concerned about losing my teeth more then anything! Don't be afraid to ask any questions you may feel are stupid as now it's ALL about you!! I told everyone and did not hold back as this was MY reality! It is not a death sentence and the care out there is amazing! Be positive and don't hold back from crying, screaming or whatever helps you as three years later I have had my reconstruction and a tummy tuck so I can't complain!! It's not been easy and it's a hard journey but your in safe hands, any questions you want answered I will do my best from my experience. Take care x",
