    "Content": "I just wanted to say hi. I'm new to this too, it just all feels rather alien!!! I came on tonight to get some info on breast pain and have found lots of good information, thanks to all for that. Sue I've not had the same treatment as you, I had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy. It all finnished last month. My breast is still swollen and itchy etc., Having read your question, I realise that there are others going thro' more than me. I wish I could take some of your worry from you. I know you don't know me from Adam. However, You'll be in my thoughts. Wishing you lots of luck. Carol",
