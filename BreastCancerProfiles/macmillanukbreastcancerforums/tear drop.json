    "Content": "My Nana was a very independent and strong woman. No matter how she felt nothing could hold her back. You couldn't tell when she wasn't feeling well, she could hide it from a mind reader. And she was forever looking after everyone else, she never put herself first. Even in hospital, she didn't want to disturb the nurses no matter how much pain she was in. She had breast cancer about 2-3 years ago. Two types of cancer I think they said. So she had her breast removed, followed by some chemo and then herceptin for a year. This finished in April 2009 and was given the all clear. Her next step was her new knee she was getting this year. A new lease of life she would have, everyone said to her. But unfortunately, she died eight months later with cancer of the liver, bones and somewhere near her lungs, in glands I think. It came as a huge shock and was heartbreaking. I guess with her being so strong, we felt she'd out live us all. We know it would never be true but that is how we felt. She had no symptoms, nothing was there to say anything was wrong. She had her usual aches and pains but I guess she put that down to arthiritis and age - which wasn't that old at 69. It wasn't until the last two weeks she started to get stomach pains which turned out to be her liver. She found out it was cancer and died two days later. No time for a macmillan nurse or the biopsys she was due to get. It was so hard to take in, I think some of us are still in shock. I suppose we can be grateful she did not suffer for a long time but it hurts so much for us as a close family. She loved life and was much loved by everyone she met, I'd put my last penny on that. I hope I can be half the person she was. With love always, a proud granddaughter wearing her pink ribbon and green pin x",
