      "Content": "Wendy woo69 Zappaman Wendy, I suffered from sleep apnoea for 20+ years so I know the effects of sleep deprivation. I was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in July, I had been losing weight long before I finally went to the doctor. I have had surgery but declined the chemotherapy, however I have a jejunostomy feeding tube I'm my intestines pumping 1 litre of liquid nutrition in overnight. So I don't get an unbroken sleep, usually 2-3 hours then up to the loo! Speak to the experts treating her and if they advise sleeping tablets take them. The body and mind work better after a decent sleep Thank you Zapperrman, I will pass on your advice. ",

I will ask her more but she did mention that she thinks it's the steroids that cause the lack of sleep & then I suppose once you've got into a routine of not sleeping at nighttime it becomes a bad habit. I've suggested the bath before bed so fingers crossed that may help.  Thanks again for your support ",
