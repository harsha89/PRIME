My fault mind you I was asked if I had questions but could n't think of any pretty daft eh! I find it really difficult to know how to feel or what to think and this has to have been the longest 7 days in creation.  Still the waiting is almost over I hope your appointment goes well on thursday.",

      "Content": "Hi Purdy had a awful couple of days but pulling myself up now.  Got news that my cancer is invasive and date for surgery on 18th June.  The surgeon has given me the choice of WLI or mastectomy but I don't feel that I have enough information to make a decent decision.   Luckily a friend called today and told me about a charity Cancer Connections and we went along to see if they could help.  They were fantastic listening rather than talking statistics at me and have arrange counselling to start tomorrow.  I feel much relieved and know that with their help I will be able to come to a decision that is right for me.   I hope you had a better experience than me, how did it go?",

I found that I have to be careful of some family advice/comments which have been rather negative but my friends have been amazing I am so lucky.  I am feeling very positive now that I will be able to make my decision in the next few days and as you say we will have our surgery on the same day.  I am pleased too that I have three weeks before the surgery which will let me catch up with all that has happened. Keep in touch and let me know how you are getting on. ",
