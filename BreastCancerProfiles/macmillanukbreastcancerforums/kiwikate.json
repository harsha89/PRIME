      "Content": "I went through op x2, chemo x6, radio x20 - all treatment finished Oct 2010, except Tamoxifen 5yrs countdown. I had to stop taking Methotrexate for R/Arthritis during treatmen but restarted 7mths ago. My question to anyone who might know is - My periods stopped whilst going through treatment but (very) surprising restarted after approx 8mths (journey began at 39yrs), started taking Methotrexate and three months later they stopped again - asked Oncol and he'd never heard of this happening but couldn't say it was the reason that it happened, have had to lower dose of Methotrexate (liver functions sus for last 12mths) as precaution and hello guess what appeared again today! Has ANYBODY had a similar situation happen or is this going to be one of those things or should I be off to the doctors again, I am seeing breast surgeon next month for check up and yearly mammogram results so could always mention to her and cut out middle doc. I would welcome any comments or suggestions. As always I WISH the BEST for all starting, going, finishing, following up or whatever stage your at, my utmost support and understanding - YOU'RE NOT ALONE",

      "Content": "Its the combo of the two that I'm not sure if that is what causing the problem. I did ask my oncologist because - I stopped then approx 8mths after finished treatment 'system' kick started again and was normal for approx 3mths but then restarted taking Methotrexate 20mgx1/wk and it stopped again approx 1mth later, but he hadn't heard of it before and it was left at that - don't know if he thought with 'system' shutting down again it what ultimately what they wanted to happen so not tooo bothered maybe?????! As I say don't know if coincidence or connected as doseage has been reduced now to 10mgx1/wk (been approx 4wks and had to miss x2wks due to bloods, so after 6wks body would have adjusted to lower levels) and maybe this is why restarted. Appreciate you taking time to look Lulu. Cheers Kathy,x",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply - hope all goes well when you go to see gynae - keep us posted. I'm going to see how this 'period' continues - did have one other appearance but it was there and gone in a day (1/2 day if I remember correctly) about 6mths ago - so far been here constantly for two days and alot 'brighter' than normal. I am going to see my Breast Surgeon on 11th April so see what she says, even if I went to docs would have to wait til 'finished', then wait til I can get in so might as well just wait the week+1/2. I certainly monitor it all the way though. I know it can be a common thing to happen but when it suddenly appears after so long it can be quite surprising and a little unnerving. We'll get there one way or another - positive thinking! Cheers Kathy, x",
