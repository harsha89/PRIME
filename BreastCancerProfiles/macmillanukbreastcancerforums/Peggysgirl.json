      "Content": "Thank you for sharing. I'm waiting on the appointment with the oncologist to find out my start date with chemo. I've been told to expect the hair to fall out and have decided to accept it and not try with a cold cap. But I have such mixed feelings. Part of me is feeling brave and sort of looking forward to experimenting with a new look. Part of me is terrified - mainly about a sort of physical \"label\". People being able to tell, just by looking at you. I've already had my hair cut shorter and am liking that, but there's a big difference between short and bald! It's good to hear from others in the same position.",

      "Content": "As Sophie236 says, whipping the bra off is now so routine, I think I could walk down the main hospital corridor topless and not bat an eyelid! I, too, was more worried about being without my glasses. However, that is one of the things that has made such an impression on me since I was diagnosed. At every stage, I've only ever been treated with dignity and courtesy, whether it's the consultant remembering to look me in the eye, even though I'm standing half naked in front of him, or the nurse holding my hand at a scan, getting cross on my behalf because I hadn't been told to keep my knickers on, and finding me a blanket to cover my dignity! I've now had 2 ops - a lumpectomy and a mastectomy. Both times, I was given 2 gowns to wear (one doing up at the front, one at the back) and paper knickers. I walked next door to the operating theatre, but the 2 gowns covered everything! I lay on the table, and was asked to slip my arms out of the gown, but the I remember the anaesthatist making a point of looking away, even though I knew that in a few minutes I would be unconscious and he would see everything! I honestly don't know how much they reveal during the op, but remember that they are only interested in the bits they need to see to do their job. I'm sure one boob is very much like another in that situation and, hopefully, you won't be seeing the theatre staff again anyway. As others have suggested, speak to your surgeon/breast care nurse. You won't be the first person to feel like this, and I'm sure they will be able to help. Good luck and let us know how it goes. xx",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm new to on line forums but I'm hoping you'll understand how I'm feeling. I know no one can say anything to make things better but I am so scared and just don't feel I can talk to anyone. My husband and family are trying so hard but everyone is trying to be brave for everyone else. I have Invasive Globular cancer in my right breast. A lumpectomy failed to clear it all and, despite the ultrasound appearing normal, I was told last week that cancer was found in all 3 of the lymph nodes that were removed. So now I face more surgery (I've decided on a mastectomy) plus chemo + radiotherapy. I have a CT scan of Friday to see if it's spread anywhere else. My mum had breast cancer and died aged 47 in 1977. I'm now 49 so have already outlived her but I don't want to die yet. I'm terrified I'll be told it's spread. Everyone tells me to be positive but why? It's been nothing but bad news so far. Why should I think it's going to be any different this time? I'm sorry to be offloading like this. I know there are people in a worse situation then me.  I probably should go to bed instead of sitting here crying but I'm on my own tonight and this was the first time I've been brave enough to look at the forum.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for the much needed positivity kick. My niece visited today. She's had a tough year with the death of a baby and then a late miscarriage. We sat and cried together and held each other. It helped (both of us ) to have someone we could be honest with about how we're feeling. It also helped me to realise that it's not all about me! From the events in Manchester to the lady on here who had to have her pet put to sleep. ( I am so sorry about that. pets can be such a comfort). I'm also looking into other support available locally. It is such a help to speak to someone who has been there. thank you again. I will be back! x",

They have a coffee morning every Thursday and getting together with others who have been through it and come out the other side has been so positive. I'd recommend anyone sees what support there is locally,",
