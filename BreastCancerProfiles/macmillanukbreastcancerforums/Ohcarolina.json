    "Content": "Breast cancer is often seen as a better cancer to have but the fact remains that many will develop in to secondaries, and breast cancer kills 12 thousand women a year. Treatment for breast cancer is often very tough, and goes on and on, plus the added losing hair and breasts all impacts on your life.Â  Breast cancer in young women is very aggressive too, and living for ten years in my mind is not a reason to feel lucky when you have cancer in your 20's or 30's. I certainly see your points, and it's important to feel like you can express yourself without judgement when living with cancer. My mum had a brain tumour and died within a year, so yes I suppose I'm glad I had breast cancer but I guess in an ideal world we would live in a world where we didn't have to compare what cancers we had. I'd feel lucky if I'd never been diagnosed with any life threatening disease. Hugs xoxo",
