      "Content": "Thanks for all your responses . I\u2019m sorry to hear about your experiences having to go through this - you are all strong ladies .  I see most of you opted for the auxiliary nodes clearance . Can you give me bit more information regarding how long stayed in hospital, was it much painful op compared to previous one involving removal of Sentinel nodes, I note that a drain will need to be fitted in place for few days and then removed.  I\u2019m just worried about complications , risk if lymphodema, I caught infection when my sentinel nodes were removed which ballooned up to size of a tennis ball however now a week later has shrunk to size of an egg and improving. It\u2019s getting better . I understand that they won\u2019t proceed with the auxiliary nodes clearance op until I am fully healed so we\u2019re looking at another month before consider operating.  I think I will need to discuss this op in detail with the surgeon next week as I didn\u2019t have much confidence in breast doctor who saw me as she disheveled know my case or background although the BC sister who was present was very helpful.  The posnoc trials - I was reading up on the literature the BC nurse gave me and it says that it\u2019s a randomized trial of armpit treatment for those with early breast cancer  They say that they do not know if treatment to the armpit adds any further benefit to adjuvant therapy thus reason why they are doing this study . Question is whether I will be chosen to take part and knowing what their decision  would be ie I would benefit or not .  I think I may have to just go with the safe option and op for further surgery . ",

      "Content": "Hi  We discussed the operation and she said that she would be looking to remove all the lymph nodes - all levels . It\u2019s all or nothing.  It would involve another procedure and she confirmed risk of lymphodema was circa 30%.  You were very lucky to have negotiated with your surgeon not to clear out all your nodes as the risk increases as more nodes are removed  They would be looking to operate within the next 31 days however I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up to having another operation so soon after my original . I\u2019m still recovering from the first as I developed a haematona and it\u2019s only started to subside ( it\u2019s now been 3 weeks) along with the pain and suffering  If u go for the op then that will be another 3-4 weeks pain . She also discussed about false nodes readings at the time of biopsy estimated at 7% so there is no guarantees that the nodes are if confirmed as being clear are in fact clear  I got  the impression that they were pushing me into giving auxilia radiotherapy serious thought as this would spare me a lot of pain and suffering plus the fact that I wouldn\u2019t have to go through unnecessary operation when the survival rates of having just radiotherapy is more  or less the same .  She mentioned that in the past it was standard practice to perform one operation and remove the tunour plus remove all lymph glands however over the years with past studies felt it was no longer necessary to give  patients all treatments available .  My concern is the risk of cancer cells spreading to other parts of the body if they have spread to other lymph glands however the breast nurse confirmed that even if The glands are removed   the risk of cancer cells soreading still exists  I am finding this a very difficult decision to make as I feel they are pushing me towards radiotherapy whereas a lot of people have opted  for ANC  My surgeon has said that she would support whichever decision I make -  my call at the end of day .. no rush .. just need to give it proper thought   Xx",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed last month with Stage 1 (Grade 1 invasive ductal/ tubular  Breast Cancer and had surgery 3 weeks ago.  I saw a BC Doctor this afternoon  ( not my normal one who did the op) who confirmed that I had  1cm tumour & 2 Sentinel Nodes removed, clear margins and one of the nodes was clear  however the other was not.   ER weakly positive. ( they confirmed it was only 33% dependent ) HER2 was negative. Very upset that the results for my nodes came back positive and we discussed options which was me either having auxiliary nodes removed.  ( level 2) to check to see whether these nodes are infected too or to partake in one of their clinical trials and see what treatment options are available for me as radiotherapy on lymph nodes may be an option. But then again they could come back stating they can not offer me any treatments.  I have a lot of thinking to do however not sure what to do for the best .  If I undergo radiotherapy there is no guarantees that the cancer cells will be destroyed and whether they will return or spread further. No guarantees whether this will work for me or whether surgery is the answer  Has anybody been through the same and opted for their auxiliary nodes to be removed ?  I have until next Thursday to think about my next steps and discuss this through with my surgeon / oncologist.  There was no mention of  Oncotype DX test & would I have had it done - something I will have to speak to my BC surgeon / oncologist about next Thursday  Is it worth me having a second opinion from another oncologist from another hospital as I didn\u2019t have much confidence in the BC doctor who gave my results   Feeling so low",

I don\u2019t think they are explaining it well to me unless I am not asking the right questions . Seeing different breast doctors etc isn\u2019t helping either as all it\u2019s doing is creating more doubt and uncertainty.  They\u2019ve not really helped me deciding what is best for me rather than say it\u2019s your decision which route to take.  Leolady - I am going to write down a list of questions for my surgeon and ask her for answers/ explanations when I see her on Thursday. I think they owe me some sort of explanation.  If I don\u2019t get satisfactory responses I will ask for a referral/ second opinion . My life in is their hands and I hope that they are truely acting in my best interests.  With regards to counseling , I had a few counseling sessions back in Feb/March following death of my father . My father also had cancer but died from another cause/ complication so cancer does run in our family ( genetic)  Obviously my diagnosis is another blow - It sounds that I need further emotional support and counseling and it\u2019s very raw discussing this with family members . I will look into this  My head is all over the place and I\u2019m not thinking clearly Thanks to you both xx ",

Ie that the cancer could spread further ( although SNB showed there being cancer cells in one node only )  and would be better operating as soon as possible ( we are only talking about an additional 2 weeks here and not months down the line or does she means that im still recovering from recent op had mid May however recovery period would have been 2 months before I depart  Some of my friends / family have said go on holiday break will do you good while some friends were concerned about my health and said cancel the holiday / have the op/ go on holiday after when all treatments have been completed however this will be many months down the line  Any thoughts ? ",

Examined by a doctor and he confirmed it was haematona.  I was in excruciating pain for over 2 hours before they gave me oral morphine followed by IV fluids . They have given me ibrophen and penicillin to clear the infection . They told me to apply ice however compared to the size it had ballooned to on Friday , it seems to have reduced now but very sore esoectially when my arm touches it . The nurses have given me pressure pads to apply to it however I am reluctant to do any arm exercises as I\u2019m worried that this may have been cause : may have over did it or lifted something heavy .  I will never know , it is so irritable I cannot sleep at night . Luckily I was signed off work for 4 weeks so I\u2019ve got another 2 weeks to recover before go back to work . I really pray it will go away on its own before 2 months as due to go away on holiday  .. last thing I need is a big lump showing and irritating me .. nor do I want any surgical intervention to remove the clot Thanks for the hugs xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Catlover it has been a while since I last posted. I was faced with a similar dilemma as you whereby I had to choose between ANC , Rads or Posnoc trial  I was sick to my stomach as felt pressurized by the Hospitsl which route I wanted to take as they could not advise . My dureonbwebt through all the options and I felt that they would have liked me to go via the trial . As my cancer is a slow growing one , grade one and they only found one infected Node following SNB , they were more slongbthe lines that there was a possibility that my other nodes would not be affected and at one stage felt either the Rads or Trial route would be the most appropriate. With regards to the clearance , I still have some BCN stipulate that having the ANC is giving more treatment than is required as if I had gone down the rads route they felt that my survival rate would be similar to had I gone down the surgery route.  With regards to Rick of lymphodema, they quoted me a 30% chance if had ANC whereas if I had rads the risk would be slightly less .  I decided to opt for the ANC and my operation date set for next  Thursday.  I chose surgery for piece of mind to get rid of any surprises should other nodes be infected .  I didn\u2019t want a computer deciding what treatment I needed going via posnoc and declined rads as firstly no guarantees will destroy all cancer cells plus there is risk of damages to healthy cells and secondly no ladies had come forward to confirm that they had opted to go for Rads rather than ANC .. i am nervous of forthcoming operation , everybody I have spoken to said I would be ok - not to worry about it . fingers crossed , everything will be fine .  Ill update after my surgery x ",

      "Content": "Good morning Cham  I feel your pain and I am also feeling very low at the moment following my surgery for lumpectomy and SNB.  Me too am waiting on an ANC and I am on the hospital waiting list which I presume will have this op towards the end of next month.  Unfortunately I cannot give you any reassurance other than I have spoken to other women who have been through this and they have successfully recovered from ANC.  For me I know I should  feel better once i get over this hurdle knowing that there is a lesser risk of cancer spreading which imagine will be the same for you. Obviously it doesn\u2019t stop there as further treatments are in the pipeline which will need to be discussed with the oncologist. We will cross that bridge when we come to it.  The problem I\u2019m facing is being in limbo until my next treatment- I\u2019m trying to enjoy life but all I seem to do is worry as I feel my life has changed as I am now a cancer patient opposed to before diagnosis where I was none the wiser. I feel I can no longer get on with my previous life before diagnosis as all I think about is cancer , getting rid of this awful disease. For me time has stopped and I m desperate to get over and done with the treatments so I can move forward.  Sounds that we both need a lot of support . Have you considered counselling sessions ?  I have been referred by my GP for one to one sessions and find that talking does help.  You are also in the right place here as this community is an excellent site to share any worries or anxieties you may have etc as we are all in the same boat.  Try and be optimistic- I know it\u2019s hard - we can beat this !  Sending you some hugs xx ",

      "Content": "Thank you ladies for your kind words of encouragement  the opersyion went well so they tell me . They operated around 9.30 am yesterday and I was in recovery for a few hours awake around 1 pm . Taken to the ward and was up for visitors.  Good news is that I\u2019m not in a lot of pain it\u2019s more tightness and soreness . They have fitted me with a drain and it looks like I will need to keep this in for a few days ( max of 5 days if it doesn\u2019t subside less than 50mls in 24 hours.  I stayed in hospital overnight and was discharged after lunch today . As soon as they take the drain out I will be in full swing d things getting on doing the exercises.  Follow up appointment is arranged for 2 weeks time with BC clinic and still awaiting for the district nurse to contact me so she can check on me and the drain. hoping when I go back  in 2 weeks it\u2019s good news ( they don\u2019t find any more cancer in nodes) and  get all clear  staying positive xx hugs to you all  ",

      "Content": "Good evening ladies  I am now Day 4 post operative and making progress with my recovery . My arm is very sore and painful at times . The incision gets very sore especially that I cannot wash or apply any pressure to the wound . I still have a drain fitted however this can now be removed as fluid is now circa 20 msl in 24 hour period . It\u2019s been like this for 2 days and I\u2019m still awaiting for my district nurse to make contact !  Imfact I am so very annoyed with the whole situation following discharge . The discharge nurse supposedly faxed referral form for visits to the community nursing team and I have had to constantly chase both the nursing team plus the hospital ward that discharged me.  They nursing team confirmed 2 days ago they had not received a referral form so I phoned the Hospital only to learn that they faxed the form to an incorrect fax number so they never received it .  I phoned the Hospital again yesterday as I still had no contact from the district nurse and they said I was on their urgent priority list - again no contact from nurse .  I phoned again this morning and again could not get through to community nurse office so I phoned the hospital again and they said the same thing , the nurse would be out sometime today . It if now 10.20 pm and still no contact or visit from them which means I need to spend another night with a drain fitted which could have been removed 2 days ago.  I know how busy they are but the way my aftercare has been handled has been appauling .. this leaves me with no option to call the hospital again tomoro and ask I come in so they can assess my wound and remove the drain . If they are unable then the  BC clinic or my GP will need to get this sorted  Not a happy bunny - can\u2019t believe I am having to go through all of this on top off breast cancer diagnosis..  i expect the best from the NHS however they seem to be letting themselves down with patient care.  :( ",

      "Content": "Evening all  This is probably a silly question but is it advisable to avoid going out in the sun for long periods?   I have had WLE and SNB and currently waiting date for my op for ANC which is likely going to be in the next few weeks .  It is very difficult trying to avoid exposing myself to the sun as I do gardening, have to travel to work and generally spend time outdoors.  I have been adequately protecting my skin with sun factor 50 and avoiding the mid day sun ..  I have been covering my scars so they are protected ..  I\u2019m worried that too much exposure to the sun may make BC worse especially as I haven\u2019t finished all my treatments yet..  What are your thoughts ? ",
