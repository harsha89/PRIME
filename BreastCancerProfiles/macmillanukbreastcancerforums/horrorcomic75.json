      "Content": "Sorry  new to all this!! I'm a bit late joining this. I'm hoping to have my third round of docetaxel on Thursday.  I'm having 4 of each. Found fec okay but I'm floored by this chemo.  I'm increasingly finding it hard to cope emotionally and I'm not sure how I'm going to get through the next two. I'm tired of pretending I'm okay but I don't have much choice as I have a 7 and an 11 year old. I keep telling myself just 2 more. ",
