      "Content": "Hi. Ive got swollen lymph nodes at the moment too. Been told if node feels squidgy its more likely to be an infection of some sort. With your rash this is likely to be the case. Go to your gp. You may need a course of antibiotics. The gp can always refer you on. Ive been refered to head and neck lump clinic as there is no signs of infection. My node is solid and hard. Always best to get these things checked out. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi. I filled the forms in truthfully saying exactly how I was affected mentally and physically. I also told them that having chemo affects the immune system and was unable to attend a face to face as they couldn' guarantee everyone would be well at the assessent. My daughter' wrote a letter stating what I couldn' do and what they helped me with. I received a phone call to clarify some details then a letter stating they had all info they needed. I was awarded high rate for both care and mobility.  Every case is different and treatment hits some people hard and others sail through. I sailed through first time round but when I was diagnosed with secondaries the treatment hit me very hard. Just be honest and hopefully you will get the outcome you deserve  Good luck. ",

I put my foot down telling them that i wouldnt let them so instead 2 of them dyed their hair bright colours and the 3rd who has a fobia of hairdressers got sponsered to have her hair cut. She has very curly hair which looked amazing before and after. She then donated her hair to the princess trust.These were very selfless acts and i am very proud of them. They did brave the shave their way raised money and showed me their support. Im very proud of them ",

      "Content": "Ive just lost my hair for the second time having been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. No im not brave  as its not a choice but it is a sign of my fight against this thing and although i have no choice in the matter it is my fight to have.  It may be only my opinion but i believe that anything that raises money and brings awareness can only be a good thing. Its thanks to people who do brave the shave, coffee mornings, sponcered walks, movember,  stoptober, etc that gives our oncos the tools to fight tbis nasty. It is why im looking at years instead of months. The choice of brave the shave as a slogan may be contravercial  and may be better with something else, lop the mop, strut the cut, anything but im focusing on the sentiment of those willing to do something to help all of us whatever that may be. These people have my support 100%. ",

I tend to find it happens mostly to me when im on my own in  bed, when the hubbys downstairs and the kids are asleep.  We tend to put on a brave face, to pretend we are invincable but sometimes we need to let it out, to cry, to scream, to say why me. We are all fighters. We are strong brave women. ",
