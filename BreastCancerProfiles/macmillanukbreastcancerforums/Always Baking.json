      "Content": "l went to the fab 'Feel Good' afternoon at Maggies (Clatterbridge, Wirral, Chesh.)  And l met an interesting lady. We chatted about Taxotere....then she mentioned about going to Nepal, China etc as a fundraising trip with Macmillan.  l would absolutely love to do something like that.  My Chemo ends Dec 8th, then surgery prob Jan, then l imagine Radio after that.  So l'm sure l cant  think about doing  anything until later  next year.  But l'd love to be thinking about it.  A diversion of mind can only be a good thing as l tread the b c boards on a daily basis for months ahead.  l wondered if there were any trips that l could do that arnt Sports natured   ie  Volunteering in  a Cancer centre  in Vietnam...for example.    if there isnt, l'd be happy to plan it myself and still fundraise...but think probably going under the Umbrella of the cancer Charity (ie Macmillan)  would be better for the insurance cover and pos better than doing it solo.    A lot to think about, but God, l'd love to do it (and fund raise as much as pos for breast cancer/cancer).",

So l could give this serious diagnoses my best shot !      Now the mornings are ''my time'' so l can sleep, rest, etc.  Then l do an hour making mum dads lunch, then rest /sleep or go out and do what l want.  l've off loaded my house cleaning for the houses etc.  You must think on these lines, and treat your illness seriously.   if you feel it's a money worry, speak to work,  l'm a bit out of touch re working for someone, but surely in this day and age, working in a job with cancer surely having time off during this serious time in your life is do- able.     ln the past, l've had times where l've had to seriously  trim down my spending...and  it can be a fun challenge to do, and rewarding to achieve.   Please dont think light of your bc illness.  You must put it top of your list of priorities !  Let us know.  Hugs, xx",

Sit your 10 yr old down and explain...that you will do all you can...but its a tricky time with all the chemo's happening...explain about how the chemo carries on working on  your body when you are at home in between each chemo..tell her she will need to help you and maybe when she comes home from school...sh might need to peel a few potoatoes..go to the shop for more milk..or pick fish and chips for tea..so the meal times are more a shared thing (instead of you doing everything)    She can wash up, thn leave the dishes to dry themselves.   She can help by putting some washing in the machine before sh goes to school (why not)   l'm not a Mum..so there will be Mum's on here who can offer you better advise 'm sure (me more a doggy adviser !)    Sat morning, she can run the hoover over and do few more lil jobs.  All l imagine well within a 10 yr olds capacity)    l'm a deligater in business, so l'm used to planning others to share the work load.    l've found Waitrose a brill online shop brought to the home..great for heavy stuff like bleach, tinned stuff, loo rolls, frozen chips/fab fab Creamed Rice Pud with clotted cream (dont just buy one)  etc.  Then that order stays on your a/c so next time you go online, its easy to re order those things you want again. And as YOU WILL BE OFF WORK...the staying in for the delivery is easy.   Sort work out first.  Sorry to nag...hope this helps. hugs xx",
