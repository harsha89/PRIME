      "Content": "Hi I apologise in advance if this is in the wrong place but really need some advice. I am a clinical researcher and training new starters to the company about breast cancer is one of many things I do within my role. I think it's for that reason that I worry about seeing the GP (again) with my symptoms and feel anxious that I'm wasting his time and will be sent away again I'm 35 years old, had a hysterectomy and SBO when I was 27 for which I'm on HRT, I also have Behçet's disease and am on Humira for that. In November a glad in my neck swelled up and has been getting more and more painful, at the same time I had pain in my left breast but no other symptoms. I saw my GP in December who said I had rib pain (probably chostochondritis) and the glad in my neck was a reaction to my behcets. Anyway, 3 weeks ago I noticed a lump in my left breast, I only noticed it because someone hugged me and it was painful. I can only feel it when I raise my arm above my head, it's underneath and kind of feels like a tendon on either side of it. The aching in that breast continues and seems to be getting worse. I am fully aware that this needs to be checked, I have an appt with my GP on the 27th Apr (earliest available) and I'm not quite sure how to get my symptoms taken seriously, I am so concerned (as is my husband who can also feel this lump).  It's so hard when you have behcets as most symptoms are put down to that, but it's fairly well controlled with the Humira I have BUPA health insurance but I still need an open referral from my GP (I think).  It's probably nothing serious, I am aware of all the statistics about lumps and a cancer diagnosis, I know there is BC in my family, not in my first degree relatives though (I lost two Aunts to it) So after that long message, I just want to know how best to approach this at my appointment, can I request a referral to a breast specialist or do I need to let my GP recommend it? What if he can't feel the lump? What if yet again I'm told it's my ribs, even though the aching pain radiates from my breast to my armpit? I feel silly having all these concerns, but I am so worried about it Thanks in advance ",
