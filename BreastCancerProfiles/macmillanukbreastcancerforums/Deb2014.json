      "Content": "Hi G n' J Thanks for the reply.  That is an option although I haven't always found the BCN's particularly helpful they tend to think it is something I should be discussing with the oncologist, I am not due to see the Onco until January 2015 but I will certainly try them, I hadn't really thought of having a break from the Tamoxifen, I'd be interested to see if anybody else has ? I've been on the Tamoxifen since November 2014 so almost a year. Debs",

      "Content": "Hello Helen Thank You I think I will contact the Oncologist tomorrow, I've had my Gynae appointment and it is for 6 weeks time, one positive I can draw from this is that there can't be much to worry about from the biopsy but the downside is the pain I am in and don't think I can manage 6 weeks without crawling the walls with the pain.

      "Content": "I am at my wits end with this, really don't know what to do next. I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer 30mm Grade 2 in July 2014 (age 50) I had a lumpectomy within 3 weeks and it was confirmed to be Oestrogen Receptive with a negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy.  I had radiotherapy for 6 weeks in December and started Tamoxifen at the same time.  I had to discuss the medication with the Gynae as I have Endometriosis but he assured me the benefits would outweigh the risks especially as I was pre-menopausal. I was having a few issues like hot sweats, cramps and weight gain but decided I could cope, I am very fit and used the gym to combat the weight gain and body shape change, which was actually coming along nicely. In February this year I started to bloat up, my GP sent me for an ultrasound which confirmed I had Cysts (simple) on each ovary, fibroids and the lining of my womb was approx 8mm and negative Ovarian Cancer bloods she said she would keep any eye on things.  In August, just as i was due for another check my periods abruptly stopped and that is when things really kicked off.  I have spent time in hospital due to the pain, I get stomach cramps, sharp stabbing pains and low back ache all feel like my period is due but it never comes.  I had an ultrasound in hospital which revealed that one cyst had gone on my left ovary but there were now 2 on my right, they couldn't see much on the ultrasound as the lining of my uterus was approx 30mm thick, very bulky with fibroids present and now a polyp.  The hospital discharged me with pain management and an outpatient appointment for a hysteroscopy.  I had the hysteroscopy this week and the doctor confirmed a large polyp, I am still to receive the results of the samples they took from my uterus.  After the procedure I did suggest that I would like to discuss the possibilities of a hysterectomy, I am waiting for an appointment with the Gynae for the results and the doctor who carried out the procedure suggested I discuss it then.   I really want to continue with my treatment but at the moment it is affecting my day to day quality of life, any help advice or support would be gratefully accepted.",
