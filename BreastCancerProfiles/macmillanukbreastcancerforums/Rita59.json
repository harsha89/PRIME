    "Content": "Hi Sorry your feeling down at the moment, I understand your frustrations on trying to keep others happy. I am seeing my surgeon tomorrow, Hopefully I will have a day for a mastectomy in the next week or so but I am already finding family and friends mean well but are telling me that I need to do this and that and often feel myself getting annoyed with them. I think it would be nice if they asked us what do we want but I honestly don't think it crosses their minds. They mean well though I am sure. Never say sorry for moaning, we are here for you.
