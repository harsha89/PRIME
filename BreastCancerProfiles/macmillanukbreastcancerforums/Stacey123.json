    "Content": "Hi Karin, I'm not sure what type of large volume biospy is scheduled, but I can tell you that the doctor will use a local anesthetic to numb the area.  I've had two core biopsies, the second was yesterday and I didn't feel anything.  Well, apart from a little sting from the needle used for the anesthetic.  The only uncomfortable bit after that was the nurse pressing on my breast to stop the bleeding from the incision.   You will be fine.
