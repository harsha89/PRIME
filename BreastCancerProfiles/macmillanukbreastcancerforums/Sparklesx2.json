      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new to this forum and am hoping someone out there can reassure or help me.... (apologies for the long post!) My mum was dx with breast cancer (Pagets) in November 2005, she was treated at the Royal Marsden and had a mastecomy, no further treatment was required but they took out the closest lymph nodes out as an insurance. We were all marvelling at how lucky she had been to not need chemo. At the start of this year mum started to get severe back pain and colds that stayed for weeks on end. Finally in April she had an MRI which showed tumours along her spine, days later she lost the use of her legs and was rushed to the marsden. Thankfully she has regained the use of her legs slightly 2 days later. She stayed in hospital for 3 weeks where further scans and tests showed that the cancer is in her spine, left side of pelvis, liver, lungs, kidneys and lymph nodes. Mum has had radiotherapy to her spine to try and relieve the pain unfortunately it didn't work. She is on Herceptin (once every 3 weeks) and chemo tablets (Capecitabine) 2 weeks on, one week off. She takes morphine tablets 3 times a day and has 10ml Oramorph for breakthrough. Various other painkillers and steroids, in total 37 tablets a day so I can't keep track of all the names. My main worries are that she is getting worse despite all these treatments and her pain is at times uncontrollable. At the weekend her back and legs gave up and she is unable to walk at all. Her legs, feet and abdomen are really badly swollen too? The hospital say she isn't allowed to take water retention tablets for this. Her steroid dosage is very high and as soon as they reduce it her pain gets unbearable. No one has told us how long they think she has and I'm so scared. On Saturday she had 4 'breakthroughs' by lunchtime as the pain was so bad. The cancer seems to be in so many places? Mum is like a different person because of the morphine, she doesn't want me to hug her when she cries and she talks jibberish most of the time. I feel like I'm letting her down because I don't know what I should be donig to help? I don't seem to be able to do anything. Any advice greatly appreciated and apologies if this is not the right place to post this xx",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your lovely replies. Yeah my step dad does all her pills for her (due to the morphine making her confused) and we have a 7 day box thing and each day has a morning, lunchtime and evening section. It's 37 tablets in total for the whole day, 7 of those are the Chemo though so every 2 weeks she has a week break from that. In there are the steroids, nerve pain killers, back pain killers, anti sickness, chemo, calcium supplements, morphine tablets hmm I don't know what else. I know when mum first came out I organised her tablets and did a sheet for her so she could be in control of her own medication but after her second stay in hospital my step dad got the tablet case thing and sorted it out for her. I will try and make up another sheet for her though maybe some control over her tablets or just knowing what she takes when will help? I raise money for our local hospice (Farleigh) and most recently I ran the london marathon for them. At our presentation they gave us a tour of the hospice and showed us where the money will be used. It was so reassuring and made me realise that they are there for the whole family no matter what stage. They do an amazing job and I'm very comfortable with mum going there for her final days. Dove, you are right, there is a stigma attached with going to a hospice and I know my mum feels like that about it even though I have explained that they are there to help just for an afternoon, it doesn't mean it's the end. Yesterday our GP came out and increased her steroid dosage to help with her pain after speaking with the Marsden. This is the Marsden that is in South Kensington? They have been very good to mum and the nurses and doctors there are amazing. It is just so hard not knowing what is going on, I'm scared to read too much as everyone is different but I look at the type of tablets she is on and have to be honest with myself....although on her rare good days you think she could pull through? On the 5th August she'll have had 4 rounds of treatment so they will do all the bone scans and MRI's etc and see if it's helped. Fingers crossed eh. Thanks so much for letting me get this all off my chest and for taking the time to reply to me - much appreciated and I wish each and every one of you lots of love and well wishes xxxx",
