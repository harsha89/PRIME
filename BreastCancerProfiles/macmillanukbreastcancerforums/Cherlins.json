I am finding it difficult that I was unaware of the lump. I have always examined myself and nothing till now. I will let you all know how my follow up goes. Good luck to any one else who is waiting results. Take care every one and thank you again. ",

      "Content": "This is my first posting on this site so hi to everyone. I had my routine mammogram three weeks ago and last Friday went to the breast clinic as I was recalled.. I had several more mammograms an ultra sound and a core biopsy. We then saw the breast care nurse who said the radiographer had scored me a 4 which apparently means it\u2019s suspicious. On questioning she said I had a 98%chance it was cancer. Either way it would have to be removed and either way may have have radiotherapy. I get the results this Friday. I am trying to stay positive but I expect you can relate to this but it just sweeps over you. It\u2019s so good to have a site like this to be able to support each other. ",
