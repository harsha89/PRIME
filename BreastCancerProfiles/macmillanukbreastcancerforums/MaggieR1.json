    "Content": "Heather77 Hello Jane Thank you for sharing this extremely interesting post about letrozole and the side effects with the different manufacturers.  It is very interesting that the ingredients are so similar for Sandoz and Femara. Like you, prior to being diagnosed in April 2014, I had been on HRT for many years (patches), so I can really identify with the shock of going from HRT support for depleted oestrogen to Oestrogen receptor breast cancer and taking letrozole. I, too, had 25 plus hot flushes per day, and severe joint pain in addition to sleeping problems.  I had some arthritis in my knee and neck, but without any oestrogen this escalated a lot and I have terrible problems now with my feet, knees, hips, neck and left arm.  I am now in my eleventh month on letrozole prior to surgery to shrink the tumour and next appointment is June when surgery will probably go ahead.   The hot flashes are much less now, but can vary between 8-10 per day so I doubt this will change whilst on letrozole. I, too, have found Sandoz to be somewhat better on side effects than any of the others and I have tried several.  Cipla and Ativist were a nightmare within days of taking them so I took them back to the chemist and they replaced them with sandoz. When I saw the oncologist at the beginning of this month, I asked if he would  write to my GPand ask  if I could try Femara for a month to see if this decreased these terrible side effects.  He has agreed to do this.  Your experience with feeling better on Femara has increased my desire to try this ASAP. I had also spoken with my local pharmacist and he said that the 'powders' as he called them vary very much from manufacturer to manufacturer and that this applies to many drugs.  He said it is very common for people to ask for specific manufacturers where there seem to be less side effects. I will let you know how I get on with Femara.  I walk every day for at least a mileor two , but  sometimes I have to 'grit my teeth' when my legs hurt a lot.   Thank you so much for sharing your post with us all - and it was not long to read at all.  It gave much informed information and I, for one, certainly need this Best wishes Heather",
