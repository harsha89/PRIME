I only had my op  January 12, to be honest the boob area  is covered and sun doesn't really get into your armpit. I just think an extra bit of zapping won't hurt, my team all said just go....!!!!! Lets face it that part of the op takes years to settle down, I'm not sure it is ever right again. If you are worried phone your BCN...I am sure all is ok.. Oh well back to the rum and coke, I think all this should be on prescription.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hugs Binny.xxx",

I also am struggling with Tamoxifen.   I'm totally exhausted all day long. I emailed my breast nurse just to keep her up to speed. She agreed Tamoxifen gave me little to know help after inputting stats into Predict Tool but wants me to keep going until Onc. app in Feb. Ok fair enough. BUT shock horror, shes just emailed me DON'T worry but your surgeon wants a full body bone scan. So ... they think it's spread then? Sometime next week, shes going on about injections going home for a few hours , scan takes an hour. I'm not sure I can take much more.  I've not told my family...I  my mum only told me yesterday \"Oh your cured, put it all behind you.\" My op was last January, my whole world again is full of fear and panic.

Actually out there are employers of small business out there that cant't, and   won't work like that, their profit margins do not allow it. I was diagnosed as you last Christmas, I am the main bread winner,   I am also a carer for my husband. I was self employed so no protection for me. Nearly a year, with all the treatments  I know I could not go back to work. OK they say its not actually the cancer, but the treatments that get you mentally and physically. they are the things that make you ill. So, I knew there was no job  for me ok 10 mins,      crashing in the armchair for a further 30,. Where can I get a job like that.!! So I decided to fight for my life not my survival. I am now a benefits Queen, I have covered my salary and more, you could say I was a busy fool. I had no Idea.....There is help out there, just knowing it. Monday you need to phone Macmillan ask for benefits advisor, be prepared  to give an hour for this. You not claiming for the Cancer but look at what its done to your body your whole soul.. Says she late up and spending an hour while her creakin bones start to move, shot to bits by Tamoxifen. I hope this has given you hope, if you need more info, friend me, glad to help, it's a rocky road with the DWP. Hugs Binny.xx  ",

I was diagnosed last Christmas, I was told the best way forward as a fulltime carer for my husband and being the bread winner and working from home was to explain to our mortgage lender that I wiould not be able to keep up full payments over the next six months, owing to the operation and treatment. To cut a long story short they asked for repossesion after 3 months as I was behind by two months, I got the first letter two days before my surgery, the judge helped out by adjourning the repossesion, they came back  just as I started Radiotherapy and applied again, they agreed to wait until the finish of my treatment. So here we are no recovery time, just spent it packing and finding rented .... To them it was a house, to us our family home where we brought up our 3 boys. I am shattered and sooooooo angry. It gets worse we thought oh treat ourselves to a nice holiday, just before my first annual check up. Travel insurers want £600 for a three week holiday.............. Good luck, I'll fly without....

I had this, but mine was a lot to do with where the lymph nodes had been removed, or so I was told. I think it's where they cut and it has interfered with the sweat glands. Once the rads were over and you get back into your old routine with shower and deodorant and of course time to let the whole area recover, it does go away. One thing they did suggest was to lay with a fan after washing and let the area get cool and really dry a few times of day. Hope this is of some help. Binny.xx",

I think we are the only civilised country where you don't get an annual mammogram and smear. Even my friend from South America gets both early 20's to 70's., they have annual checks for these BP and bloods....that's what you call good medicine.  Nip things in the bud.. Smears stop ay 64, why? People are living longer,( the pension age has gone up.!! )  and enjoying their life as never before.......... Yes we have to do something, they have money to treat health tourists..... I'm 59 and on Tamoxifen so would like to have an annual smear, I was told by GP, I will get one more at 64, there is no money in the budgets...... She suggested I pay privately £140 approx., not sure about paying for the mammogram, but why should we. We need thorough annual check ups.
