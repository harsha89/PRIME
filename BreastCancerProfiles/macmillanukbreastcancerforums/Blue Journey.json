    "Content": "Hi... I'm new here and to cancer but I think this is a fab site with lots of support... I'm happy I've joined. I haven't told everyone I know that I was diagnosed with breast cancer, only some of my friends know... I somehow don't want to tell them: don't know why. Perhaps some of the reactions I will get from them would upset me. The latest example, being a phone conversation between my sis-in-law and me: Sis: Ok... then, I will call you again in 2 weeks' time (don't know why \"2 weeks\" and not \"soon\"? Anyway.) me: Fine. I don't think I will peg it in the next 2 weeks!Â  Sis: You never know... you never know... (at this point she still didn't realise what she'd just said... and I was on the floor, lol) Yes, may be I shouldn't tell more people? Good luck everyone!",
