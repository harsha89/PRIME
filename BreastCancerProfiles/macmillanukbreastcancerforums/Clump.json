      "Content": "Hi Elaine, Just thought I d share my experience which might help with your decision. I met all the criteria for the oncotype test but as I live in Scotland I wasn't offered it and didn't know it even existed until it was too late to even try and find the funds to pay for it privately. So I was in the situation of having to make the chemo decision with my husband and onco based on the Nhs predict score and general chat. It was an extremely tough decision to make (eventually decided no chemo). I still live with the knowledge that a test exists that would have given me an idea of whether my tumour would have reacted well to chemo and the likelihood of it coming back, but I never had it. So yes you may fall into the difficult grey area where you still have to make the tough decision based on uncertainty but you may not. If you don't like living with uncertainty and thoughts of 'what if' then you may find it best to go for the oncotype test to increase your chance of more concrete info. I guess it all depends on how willing you are to consider chemo as a possibility. Unless you are absolutely sure you don't want chemo no matter what, having the oncotype test may help with some of the 'what if' feelings later on. Hope you get to a decision you re comfortable with, Love Lucy",

I think someone else suggested asking whether the appointment could be moved to a different date; maybe there's someone who could call on your behalf and explain the situation rather than you having to do the explaining yourself.

When I ve read up on it apparently it is a recognised side effect of hormone therapies. I take my tablet before bed to try and mop up worst of the effects overnight. It's not very practical for planning ahead but I try and make the most of when I m feeling most alert to get stuff done and give myself times when I don't fight it and try to just go with the flow (all much easier said than done!). Afternoons/early evenings seem to be best which I presume is as the tablets wear off a bit.

Even if things haven't improved yet I m sure it's got to be better to let things out than keep them bottled up, which so many of us do. And you let it out in what should be a really safe and beneficial place to do so. You may have unknowingly helped everyone else enormously; it may start the ball rolling of others opening up, I bet some of them went away thinking why don't I let someone know I m struggling too. And if nothing else is achieved it might give your BC nurse a kick up the rear end to realise she should be doing a lot more to address emotions. Personally I made it to one session of my local 'support group' and found it so unsupportive that I found myself in the loo in floods of tears, made an excuse about not feeling well and left! And no one ever followed me up, so I think I probably made the right decision! I m hoping your step in tackling this ridiculous front that we feel we have to put on helps you and many others, and that each of us will find a few safe people we can be open and honest with.  If we all take that first step maybe gradually more people will feel able to talk to us about our 'cancer journeys' and not only want to hear the \"everything's fine\" line....I can dream anyway! Maybe if you carry on struggling to deal with the emotional turmoil see if your gp/ bc nurse can refer you for counselling or some form of moving on course. I ve been referred for CBT and have found it surprisingly helpful, and am starting the Maggies Centre Online 'Where Now' course online tomorrow which I m really looking forward to. Anyway, enough of my rambling. Sending you a big hug, Love Lucy xx",

Earlier this year I had my ovaries removed, so am now post menopausal. I don't have access to an oncologist for monitoring the hormone therapy, its done annually by my breast surgeon. When I saw him in October for my two year check he said it was fine to remain on tamoxifen if I wanted to and there would be no difference in benefit if I switched to aromatase inhibitor. As I finally feel like I'm getting used to tamoxifen that's what I chose to do. However today, reading around the new research that's come out, I have consistently read that aromatase inhibitors are more effective for preventing recurrence than tamoxifen in post menopausal ladies. I m wondering what advice others have been given in similar situations?  Thanks, Lucy",

I m typing this feeling like a trussed up chicken (well something like that!), wearing a giant compression bra for the breast/shoulder blade lymphedema, sleeve and currently a glove as the sleeve alone moved it to my hand (a less restrictive gauntlet is on order for me). It's fair to say that wearing underwear that not many self respecting ladies twice my age would be happy with is not great in the middle of summer! I have a great lymphedema nurse now who is working with me to try and get the least impact on my day to day life whilst aiming to keep the lymphedema at the relatively early stage it is now. She did mention kinesio taping as a future option and has experience using it. So in your experience is it worth me asking to try the kinesio taping now, rather than the trussed up in garments approach? The sleeve doesn't bother me but if I could ditch the bra top I d be delighted! How long does the taping stay on, need to be reapplied etc? Thanks,  Lucy x",

      "Content": "Hi Silvercloud, I m not sure it ll help much with your own decision but I ll share my chemo decision making process. My surgeon told me he strongly recommended me having chemo (age 41 with 2 kids, post mastectomy for stage 2 invasive, hormone positive with all lymph nodes clear, eventually found to be her 2negative), in his words \"there's always benefit to chemo\". Then I go to the oncology team...the nurse who 'clerked me in' gave a wry laugh when I told her the surgeon's comments. The oncologist talked me through the statistics (all a bit mind boggling) and there didn't seem to be that much of an improvement in my survival rate by adding chemo to the hormone therapy I knew I had to take. I live in Scotland and we don't get offered oncotype test and at the time i didn't know it existed. So the onco wouldn't give me a definite opinion about what to do but kind of nudged me along that for me with my results the risks outweighed the benefits. The nurse in the room very much agreed judging by her obvious non verbal communication! It was still a really hard decision to make in deciding not to have the chemo. In your case I think definitely wait for the oncotype result which may add some really useful info to the decision. And definitely talk all your worries through with the breast care nurse who can hopefully help get awnswers to your questions and give you confidence in whatever decision you make. By the way...when I saw my surgeon again after 6 months he said \"I see you decided not to have chemo, I think that was a good decision!\", despite his very firm stance to the opposite 6 months earlier. So personally I d say ignore your surgeons views (he/she are good at the cutting part!) and use the more specialist oncology members of the team to help you decide what's right about the chemo for you. I hope the stress of the waiting part settles a bit and you eventually come to a decision you are 'happy' to live with, Love Lucy",

Even before I had cancer I was upset to see others shave their heads for charity, particularly children. I admire their fundraising ethos but a campaign like this puts pressure on loved ones and others to shave their heads or look like they don't care by keeping their own hair. And as many have said, voluntarily shaving your head in no way helps you realise what it's like to go through cancer, in particular the enormity of having to loose your hair whilst also dealing with all the other challenges of cancer. I think increasing the number of people shaving for charity just belittles the deep and complex experience of those who have no option. I have been so grateful to MacMillan for the work they do, but I think this campaign is one they shouldn't have launched.",

Rebecca T...I agree in many ways, but for me my feelings for Macmillan have genuinely been changed by their lack of concern for the sincere distress and offense they are causing to so many of the very people they're supposed to be supporting. I don't want to villify them, but I m seriously disappointed and hurt by this persistent campaign.",

      "Content": "I m just getting back into swimming after my mastectomy 5 months ago. It's really helping with residual pain and cording, and it feels so good to slowly 'get going' again. It's mainly fatigue that's made me take this long to get in the pool again. I ve found I needed the higher coverage of a specialist swim suit and my old sports costume wouldn't have worked for me even with a pocket. But you'll be able to see whether that applies to you when you ve had your surgery. The specialist costumes seem to have good but subtle padding on both sides that help to even out any differences in breast shape/prosthesis shape too. If you find you do need a new costume I found it was worth spending a bit more to be confident that my prosthesis would stay in place and I had good high cleavage coverage! Looking out in the sales on sites like Amoena worked well. I haven't checked what size swim prosthesis Amoena go up to but they were very quick and helpful when I emailed them a query. Personally I found I needed the weight of a more substantial prosthesis rather than a knitted knocker to keep balanced and prevent costume riding up a bit. I hope the surgery goes well and you return to the pool before too long Love Lucy xx",

It says there's no interaction with milk thistle so it looks ok. To check it out for yourself, and any other supplements, it's a great website to use. I m no good at inserting links here, but Dreamthief has often posted about it and how to use it. If you type Memorial Sloan Kettering into this group's search space I m sure you ll find some previous helpful posts. Hope that makes some sense! Love Lucy",

I'm 41, exactly meet all the criteria for the Oncotype test but it wasn't offered to me because I live in Scotland where it's not yet done routinely for funding reasons. I didn't even know the test existed at the time or would have considered trying to find the money for a privately done test. Instead I had to make the decision whether to have chemo based on a discussion with the oncologist. I decided against chemo in conjunction with him, but I still wonder if it was the right decision or not. I m just trying to move on and forget it, easier said than done! I hope your result will give you a clear idea about what's best for you. Great results so far!  Love Lucy xxx",

I wouldn't accept being left with a sleeve that makes your arm worse not better. I actually find that wearing my sleeve (all day till bedtime, every day) actually helps a lot with the uncomfortable feeling of lymphoedema. I 've not been bothered too much by swelling but the nagging, heavy feeling isn't nice..def try a sleeve. As regards the brushing..try a baby's hair brush..lovely and soft and feels great!

      "Content": "Hi Stormy,  I too had a left mastectomy in September 2015 without reconstruction. I m still not used to that fact but it's definitely manageable. I m only a c cup so may not be best placed to give you advice, but I would try to find a post surgical bra (try asda online, debenhams online and specialist companies like Amoena). That gives support to yiur remaining breast without being too uncomfortable on the surgical side. Personally I ve found specialist vest type tops the most comfortable to wear; supportive with a built in pocket for a prosthesis. I ve only used Amoena tops which I ve got in their sales, they make nightwear too. I m sure there are plenty of other manufacturers too. Have a look; they re reassuringly normal and nice looking! Once I m wearing my prosthesis you really can't tell I ve had any surgery. I m still struggling a bit with pain and discomfort, which does impact on what I wear, but surgeon wants to see me as it's not what he d expected by now.  I don't have any great advice about how to cope emotionally. If you can let your breast care nurse know how you re feeling, and use this sight for help and support. If you re struggling post treatment there's counseling and so on available. Try and look on it as a positive treatment step if you can. Keep us posted with how you re getting on and what your treatment plan turns out to be,  Love Lucy xxx",
