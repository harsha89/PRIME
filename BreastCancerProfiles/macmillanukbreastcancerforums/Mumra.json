Was supposed to get them last Friday but it got postponed. I've got to say I've found the node op much more painful than lump op, it's been the gift that keeps on giving! I know already that I'm ER and PR positive and they've mentioned tamoxifen. So it looks like we three are all on a similar path at the mo. My armpit is also numb but I think that is improving slightly. I have found that the underside of my arm from armpit to near my elbow has also been really tender, bit like bad sunburn, so I'm thinking that's possible nerve damage/repair. Well I'm off to try and keep busy, the stress is v high today. Would love to hear how you are both getting on and feeling. Love and hugs to you. Kathy xxx",

Glad you spoke to your bcn, leave as much worry as you can at her door.   It must be hard for you  with young children and even harder when you have a child with a disability, have you got family friends who could \"divide and conquer\" with the children, ie perhaps have one at a time to give you and them a break?  It's not,the same but having three little girls, I had three in under four years, I understand a bit as three is definitely a crowd, even if they are just their usual boisterous selves. Try not to look at this cancer cxxp as a big mountain to climb, maybe just on an hour by,hour basis or if you feel good, a day by day basis.   Keep posting honey, throw your all your cares and woes at us, I don't know much, but some people on here are amazing with their,knowledge and life experiences, you are amongst friends here beachhutter so use us.

I've only joined this group two days ago and I've read as much as I can on all the BC threads and it's not only informative it's also uplifting and on here you are normal, everyone has been through the diagnosis process and can offer advice. I wish I'd joined sooner, and so in that respect you are ahead of me. I'm recovering from lump removal and main lymph node removal. I have, or maybe had(!) invasive ductal and lobular tumour. I've got my results appointment on Friday, which can't come soon enough! Good luck with everything and let me/us know how you are getting on. Kathyx",

Get comfy before they begin, you have your face in a padded hole, like you would if you were having a back massage. Then they scan you, bit noisy but ok, then for last 5 mins or less the put some contrast dye in, it feels warm, but again doesn't hurt. I think you would be ok to go on your own by why not ask someone to go with you, just in case you have to wait about or need a cuddle.

I'm feeling very blessed xxx. Joyce you can definitely achieve your 7lb goal be kind to yourself until the radiotherapy is out of your system and then go for it.  Is your head any better now? There's a pressure point on your hands it's the chunky bit under your thumb, massage that on both hands and also try opening your mouth as wide as you can and holding it for a second or two and repeating a couple of times, in case you have tnsion in your jaw.  Hope you enjoyed your walk xx much love.

Can't believe it's over, we are just off out for a meal to celebrate and have some bubbly in the fridge for later.  Skin not too bad, dropped a letter into docs asking for more double base and double base wash, so I think that will all be great for me.  Went and bought anti slip mat for shower as my track record for falling over is not good, and the wash makes everything mega slippy!  Have also been asked to take part in a trial about after care when treatment ends, so will have a read up and decide.  Sounds ok though, they said they know there should be something after treatment but they are trying to gauge what would help us.  I'll let you know what I decide and a bit more info if you or anyone else is interested.  I'm so glad you are doing well Joyce, long may it continue.  They told me today that feeling down and tearful is also a side effect of the rads and that it will continue for at least a month, I wasnt aware of that.  Keep me posted on the tea party.  Much love.

I know once it's going on then I'll just be stoic and get on with it but it's been a flipping long time coming as I had my op on 26 March, then had the oncotype Dx test which took ages to come through, but I was lucky and dodged chemo. I've probably had too much time to think about it, and I know it sounds a daft thing to say but you have the treatment in the cancer centre and I usually live in la la land and the treatment makes me face cancer. I still have moments of \"I'm sure they've made a mistake, it can't be me they are talking about!\" It's the gift that keeps on giving ladies isn't it! Best wishes for tomorrow's treatment.

      "Content": "Hi Joyce, so glad you've had a better weekend honey. Half way means you are on the home straight !! I take the calcium tablets as I've got low vit D and you can't have one without the other. They are adcal and you chew them. I was a bit dubious but they are no problem. I think there's also another one that you take weekly, but so far I've avoided that. I've been fine this weekend and getting zap number 3 on Monday, it will also be my first 5 days of treatment without a break, so a little apprehensive about side effects. You are a glutton for punishment! Well done though, I haven't got my nerve up to commit to anything yet. Keep us posted as to how your baking progresses and you might inspire me! I've got my sister bringing my mum to see me tomorrow, they live two hours away, so I'm looking forward to that, even though it will be a quick visit as I'll have to go and get zapped. Then it's my birthday on Wednesday, so I'm focussing on the good stuff and hoping my boob doesn't end up glowing like a beacon guiding people in! Good luck tomorrow Joyce, and margy. Much love. Kathy xxx",

Enjoy your celebration lunch tomorrow, we are going to do something next weds but as all mine are so late, it'll be dinner. My machine was 50 mins late today, I think I'll fall over if I go in on time, but the team are lovely and it's not their fault.  I'm back looking at holidays again, we just want a break not too far away, my daughter and friend were telling me about Croatia so I'm going to investigate.  Good luck. For your last one tomorrow Joyce, and margy I hope the continued cooking of your boob doesn't get too sore. Much love Kathy xxx",

Ive had another brilliant day, been at my daughters all day with the grandchildren and then Victoria cooked a celebratory meal, beef Wellington with all the trimmings and Ava and I made chocolate brownies for desert, more champagne And my son In law bought me a beautiful bouquet, which made me cry, again!  Boob more tender inside than out really, I'm still laying the cream on, but nothing too bad, let's hope it carries on like that.  Oh and just done two days on my anastrazole, so far so good! Have a great weekend everyone.  Much love. Kathyxxx",

      "Content": "Good luck to you both, I'm the same as Joyce and have just finished my rads.  I had a mixed tumour of invasive ductal and lobular which was 25mm, grade 2. I had WLE and sentinel lymph node surgery in March.  My lymph nodes were clear and my tumour was ER+ with a score the same as yours 8:8 so I have just started anastrazole.  I didn't need chemo as they sent my tumour off to USA and it was tested using the oncotype Dx test and it came back that it would respond better to hormone therapy.  Where you both are now seems a long road and the worst part is the waiting for things to happen, but you can do it and once it's all underway, you'll feel better and before you know it, you'll be the other side of treatment waiting to be told you are a NEDDY, just like Joyce and I.  Joyce and I and another lady margy have all supported each other through rads and we are all here to support you if you need it. With love. Kathy xxx",

You can do,both in Vegas , with sun block of course, as you've got Grand Canyon and loads of other stuff fairly nearby. Xx",

I would ring her and ask her all those questions and say you weren't happy with the experience, as that doc shouldn't be let loose on people yet! Re the pain, mine lasted ages, but tell your bcn and don't do too much too soon. Having chemo hanging over your head is pants, I had it hanging over me from 17april until last Friday and it nearly drove me nuts. I was offered and had the oncotype dx test which has now come back as no chemo, so the wait was worth it. I hope you get some answers and some pain relief, and do have a good cry if you want to, I know I have and it does release the pressure. Much love Kathy xx",
