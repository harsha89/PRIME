      "Content": "I had horrendous sickness after my 1st chemo so was given Emend/ aprepitant which worked a treat. As others have found I learned to take meds regularly to prevent side effects rather than trying to be brave and only taking them when the situation got unbearable. The drugs work better that way both the anti sickness meds and the paracetamol/ibuprofen following Taxotare.  You're going through chemo, you've enough on your plate without adding to your burden. My tastebuds are shot - I've just had my last chemo. The only drink I can take is dilute elderflower cordial let down with cold water (from fridge). Even tap water tastes bitter.  I do drink the odd cup of tea or coffee but they exacerbate my hot flushes so I try to stick to cold drinks.",

      "Content": "Hi Shineyb1 Welcome to the club, though like the rest of us I'm sure its not a choice you'd really want to have joined. Still it sounds as though you're taking the diagnosis on the chin and getting on with it. Well done you, they say that a positive outlook has a big impact on how well you respond to treatment. I've been making sure I do at least 1 hour of moderate exercise 3-5 times a week as there is mounting evidence that exercise during chemo improves treatment outcomes by reducing recurrence by up to 60%.Have a look at the recent trial from Australia. There isn't a drug with such a positive effect so for me that's something I can do to improve my treatment. Of course there are days when you struggle to get out of bed and all you can do is weep, but I've found on the good days (and there are more of them than the drippy days) just going for a walk or a 10 minute cycle ride into town lifts my mood no end. For me the doctors & nurses are looking after my treatment and I'm looking after my mental outlook (and keeping an eye on the treatment - once they forgot to give me all my iv chemo and give me all my pills). I too have had issues with allergy and my PICC line. I'm allergic to Nickel so I can't have the stud that secures it to my arm so just have a sticky pad. This means no tennis. Well no right hand tennis - I'm trying left had tennis instead. I also reacted badly to the cleaner they use for the PICC line. It felt like they'd poured acid into the wound so after 1/4 of tears another nurse removed the dressings and washed it with saline. The last time they cleaned the surrounding area with the sterile swab but washed the wound with saline so no pain. There's always a way round problems if you ask. Sorry I can't help with the benefits system personally - have you tried the Macmillan benefits adviser? Good luck with your treatment and your life during and beyond!",

      "Content": "Hi Charlotherapy I too had awful pain from FEC - the epirubicin (red stuff) in particular. After the 2nd session which was agony despite using a hot pad on my arm and slowing down the infusion, the nurse recommended I get a PICC line. This I did and though I had the same misgivings as you am glad I did.  One thing that put me off was they said I should stop playing tennis (I am allergic to Nickle so they couldn't use a stud to hold the PICC line in place) so I switched to playing left handed instead. My chemo finished in September and I am now left with damaged veins from the chemo and wished I had been advised to have the PICC line earlier. It did add another issue - having to have it re-dressed weekly - but the reduction in the pain during chemo infusions and the reduction in  the damage to my veins means I thought it was well worth it. I dread to think what my veins would look like if I'd not had a PICC when I did. As it is my arm which used to have big soft fleshy veins loved by nurses for taking blood now has dents where the veins have hardened and shortened. Think spiderman veins.  I now have to regularly stretch them and massage my arm to reverse the restrictions they cause in my arm movements. When they are bad they feel like they are giving me a Chinese burn. What ever you decide I would thoroughly recommend doing as much exercise as you can during chemo. It reduces the likelihood of a recurrence by up to 60% (no drug can produce results like that) and it makes you feel so much better. I did yoga twice a week (apart from the sofa week after the steroids had worn off post chemo treatment) played tennis once a week and tried to walk or use my bike at least 3 times a week. My Breast nurse said I didn't look like someone who'd just finished chemo. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi jmp I was on high dose HRT when I was diagnosed so had to stop taking it immediately. After several months of trying various things I'm now on Clonidine which allows me to get a reasonable nights sleep most of the time. Well it did until I was put on Anastrazole. Result awful night sweats, pain & pins and needles in my hands and arms so I had to sleep with my arms stuck out at right angles when lying on my side (most uncomfortable). This drove my husband into the spare room. The oncologist told me to try a drug holiday. So I stopped the Anastrazole for 9 days (should have been a week but I didn't want to ruin my weekend). Result the side effects are hardly noticeable. I sometime get a bit of numbness - particularly if the radio therapists take too long while I'm lying in the surrender position during my treatment - but I'm sleeping better and feel more myself, though very tired. Though that's probably the radio therapy - finish Friday - can't wait! Hope this helps, Good luck.",

She recommended I got a prescription for heavy duty laxatives and drank lots before during & after the chemo. I drank so much water & fruit juice before & during chemo I became 'comfortably soft' on day 1. On day 2 nothing. So wondering if I need to get a laxative in addition to all the fruit & veg I'm eating & drinking.  Hope this helps. Together we'll find a way through this Picturemish",

      "Content": "Hi mizz59 I had my 1st FEC chemo today. Drank lots of water & fruit juice the day before & on the day to counteract the constipation caused by the medication they give you for nausea & sickness. My first cannula started to hurt 15 mins into the red chemo infusion so did as I was told & told nurse who took it out & replaced it with a new one in another vein. That hurt a little bit but the pain eased once they applied a heat pad.  The whole procedure took about 3 hours because of the problems so it's worth taking lots of things to occupy you. I took a magazine, podcasts, a book & my mobile. Found I couldn't concentrate much so dipped in and out. My breast cancer nurse advised me a week ago to request a prescription for sleeping tablets a couple of weeks ago. I haven't had a decent nights sleep since 15th March when I was diagnosed & Immediately stopped the HRT. Cue night sweats every 2-4 hours causing me to wake up lathered in sweat. A friend who went through chemo last year said the steroids they give you to combat the nausea made her so wired she didn't sleep for 7 days. So am going tomorrow to pick up a prescription for sleeping tablets tomorrow. Since I got home from the hospital I've been tired but not sleepy so looking forward to being able to sleep tomorrow if not tonight.   Hope these help & don't worry you too much. As everyone keeps telling me, we're all individuals so just go with the flow & be kind to yourself.  Good luck.",

      "Content": "There's always a silver lining to every situation. For me losing my hair was something I dreaded until I went to a pamper session at The Marina Dalgliesh \"penthouse suite\" at Aintree Hospital. There I saw a lady who came in totally bald with a beautiful scarf around her neck. I stopped her and said \"Thank you for coming like that today, you've given me so much confidence about going bald. I only hope I look half as good as you do\". A week or so after that I started losing my hair and a week later went round to my friend with my husband and we had a shaving ceremony. It was actually fun and very liberating not to be waking up with hair on my pillow or clogging  up the shower. A few months later I saw her again. Her hair was beginning to grow back. We decided that we needed to get some photo's done before this became just a memory. So I arranged for a photographer friend of mine to come and do a photoshoot with the two of us. While he was changing lenses I grabbed my camera and took a few shots of her. A few months after that she had a big party to celebrate finishing her treatment & I took a framed print of the photo I'd taken of her. She was thrilled. Afterwards with her permission the other photographer and I entered a Macmillan competition to show the positive side of cancer. His photo of me came in the top 10 and mine in the top 5. Here's my winning image https://flic.kr/p/TFXemn. Rather than making me feel like a shrinking violet there were a couple of occasions when my bald head gave me real power to do good (I hope). One was when I was walking to the hospital for (yet another) blood test. I passed a local high school there 2 young women were sat on the wall outside smoking. I stopped, took off my scarf and said to them \"If you want to look like this - keep on doing that\" pointing at their cigarettes. As somebody once said \"You cannot be a victim without your consent\". Be proud of your bald head - it's a visual clue to the battle your fighting as a strong woman against an awful disease. And it's soon over - time flies - I'm back to having to make hair appointments and buy shampoo.",

The 2nd time was much worse and it was only when I screamed in pain (surprising myself - I'm not a drama a queen) they asked why I'd not had a PICC line. Turned out the oncologist was anti PICC lines. Anyway after that I had to get a PICC line & that was the end of the pain but not the damage 2 cycles of Epirubicin had done to my veins. Before the treatment they were a nurses dream - big prominent and easy to stick needles into. After they became hard and shrunken. My arm looked like a lizard with a tight network of veins shrunken below the surface of my skin from my wrist to just short of my armpit. It's now 18months since I finished my chemo and my hair and nails have grown back but my veins in my chemo arm are still damaged (though it has improved slightly). It's still a struggle to find a decent vein for blood tests every 6 months prior to my Adjuvant infusion. I echo the other advice you've been given here. This is one time you have to be vigilant and take really good care of yourself. If in doubt get advice from the 24hour chemo helpline or your breast nurse or your GP or failing them A&E.",

She'll help you work out an exercise programme to suit you ranging from simple walking to cycling or gym - whatever works for you. Exercise has been shown to reduce recurrence of cancer by up to 60% there is no drug as effective. It also helps you get through surgery, chemo & radiotherapy better.  Good luck!",

I finished my chemo last September and radiotherapy in arch but still don't feel quite back to normal re energy levels though some days are better than others. I found chemo wasn't too bad - 3 good days, then a crash week followed by recovery with the last week getting back to near normal energy levels apart from having to have an afternoon nap. However I was enrolled onto an exercise programme - my choice of exercise - as  was told it not only helps you recover from treatment quicker and easier but it improves the outcome. There is strong evidence that doing exercise - even if its only walking round the block every day - reduces the likelihood of recurrence by up to 60%. There isn't a drus that's as effective. I've slipped recently on the exercise front - its too easy to find an excuse to do something else isn't it? However I've met up with some friends from the Macmillan HOPE course today and they've reminded me that I need to keep it up as you feel so much better and have more energy after doing exercise. Hope you find more energy soon.",

Turned out I was allergic to the dressing and my skin became very inflamed and weepy as well as very sore. One night I woke myself up scratching off the dressing and had to phone the 24 hour emergency help line. My nurses now clean the area near the insertion point with saline to prevent the pain I had from the cleaning pad and used sorbaderm to protect the affected skin plus use a non-allergenic dressing (Mepitel). I also take an antihistamine tablet every night. Don't put up with pain - ring the helpline and get advice, is my advice. There's enough to cope with - you don't have to suffer pain too. Good luck!",
