I have been told will be havin the PICC line in arm it's great to know others whom have had same treatment as really does help prepare for it. Has anyone tried the cold cap? and also what is the effect on hair? I have been told to prepare myself with wig or hat I did go and get a wig which is nice and similar to my natural hair I have Also picked up hats and scarves as I don't think I will be able to cope with no hair - I will be definitely trying the cold cap but have been told may not help that much and waiting time after treatment is longer. Thank-you all again",

Oncologist said is aggressive and lympnodes were clear but may have spread to other part of body as her2 and hormone receptor positive also was asked if wanted to freeze eggs if wanted to have children in future as I was suppose to get married this year- I will ask for mri scan and bone scan as theyv said they can't pinpoint exactly where it could have spread to they don't want to take any risks that's why want to do FEC-T +herceptin followed by radiotherapy then finally can have reconstruction - I will ask everything I can think of to put my mind at rest.
