      "Content": "Thanks for replying ell dee I am so glad that everything turned ok for your daughter and I hope that you are doing well xxx I am trying to stay positive but do fluctuate between being convinced something is wrong to believing it is nothing to worry about and at least it is now not in my body. I think I am just going o be prone to lumpy breasts as this is my 3rd lump to be investigated but previous two where put down to fibrocystic breast disease. Did your daughter have an excision and if so did she have to wait long for the results? Sorry to ramble as you can see by the time I am Struggling to switch off tonight! Kind regards xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi I am completely new to these forums and have never posted before but I'm hoping for some advice or just to listen to other peoples experiences. I had an excisional biopsy yesterday under general to remove a lump in my right breast. Three weeks ago I had an fna and the results came back as inadequate and so my consultant decided to have it removed. I am obviously worrying and to make things worse whilst they where removing the lump they found an extra bit at the side that was attatched to the chest wall? The consultant had previously said she thought it was a fibroedenoma but I thought these where mobile? Also -and I'm sure I'm just being paranoid- she told me prior to op that I would get a letter with results if clear but if further treatment required etc I would get an appointment to see her again then after surgery she told me I would get an appointment through to see her to discuss the results- do you think she knew something already? Sorry to go on lol I'm reading into everything !!! I am 33 have two little girls 3 and 7 and sadly lost my mum to breast cancer last June aged 59 within 10 months of diagnosis she previously had it at 51. Any words of advice greatly received thank you xxx",
