      "Content": "Hi Betty Not quite as ghastly as yours sounds but I have had a leak and now have a very red / angry mark on ,y hand which I have been told may be permanent. This was 6 weeks ago and I have had no improvements to its look During the session I told the nurse it was burning and stinging at least 3 times, and she discmissed me and told me that the pressure on the machine was okay therefore I must be wrong!! A couple of days after the sesion it became red and like it was badly bruised. I showed the Oncoligist and last time I attended they were taking photos and all sorts - may they are felling like ' where theres blmae theres claim' LOL !! I am just disappointed that they were so dismissie of me and yet when you have your first treatment they made such a big thing about tell us if it hurts. I have at least three veines in my arms that have sunk / shrunk from the treatment and they now look like darker sunken lines on my arm. Not great - again liekly to be permanent I am kind of past caring most days and tyr and have the attitude, just get this over with as life is more important, but then eveynow and again I have a bloody good cry !! Keep in touch Mandy X          ",

I was able to buy a couple for a couple of pounds. I also trawled second hand shops as alot of scarves today are rectangular and obviously we need square I did buy some on line but must admit was disappointed with them when they arrived Good luck with your hunting X",
