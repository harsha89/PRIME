      "Content": "7 weeks ago I had a lumpectomy. Initially after the biopsy I was told by my consultant/surgeon I would need chemo. Then later I got a phone call from my  macmillan nurse saying it was good news because  after further testing of biopsy sample it showed I was oestrogen positive so I wouldn't need chemo but when I saw my surgeon at the two week post op appointment she advised chemo because the op results showed I was not oestrogen positive after all. She said she would make an appointment for me to see the Oncologist for me to discuss the pros and cons of chemo and that the Oncologist and I could come to a decision then. In her letter to my GP it clearly states I said I would come to a decision about chemo after talking it through with my Oncologist. I had my appointment with the Oncologist last week and she told me that my tissue sample could have further testing in America which would show the risk factors of cancer reoccurrence and weigh up whether the risks of chemo outweighed the risk of reoccurrence depending on whether I was low, intermediate or high risk for reoccurrence. I said that sounded a very sensible idea. I was astounded when she said that when she had phoned up my macmillan nurse she had told her that I definately wanted to have chemo anyway, because of this the Oncologist said she hadn't sent the tissue off to be tested. The Oncologist was clearly disappointed that she had been misinformed because if she had sent off the tissue sample when she wanted to I would have had the results that day and could have made a start on the best treatment. The tissue is going to be sent off to America now but it means I have to wait another 10 days before I get the results. Having to unexpectedly  wait another 10 days for results is bad enough although worth waiting for but what I find really upsetting and more than annoying is the action of the macmillan nurse making a decision for me. I feel she has crossed the line by taking the control out of my hands and I have absolutely no confidence in her at all. I feel she's really messing with my head. Everytime I think about it I feel so angry.",

If I don't have chemo and go straight on to radiotherapy I don't think I will see her again as the radiotherapy is in a different hospital anyway. i've only met her the once anyway as she seems to be more involved in administration than anything else.",

The community nurses are fine about coming out to give me my injections and have had to travel out in some horrible wintry weather conditions and never let me down and never grumble. I would love to have managed myself so as not to add to the nurses workload but i'm afraid it's not to be. I'm not squeamish about having the injection and I can watch while the nurse does it but that's as far as my bravery goes.",

      "Content": "I'm disappointed to find you don'r get your wig voucher before you start chemo. I'm waiting for a phone call from hospital to start my chemo any day now. It's now 11 weeks since my op. I thought you would be able to get sorted with a wig beforehand . My decision of whether to try a cold cap or not was going to be based on how I felt about wearing a wig.  Seeing as I live out in the sticks it's not like I can just pop into a wig shop any old day and probably won't feel like driving a long way into town after i start my chemo. I've rung my BCN to see if I can pick up my voucher only to find that her answerphone message saying she''s not at work is out of date so I have no idea if she's in and going to get my message or not. When I was first diagnosed they painted this rosy picture of how I was going to be so well looked after and they were at the end of the phone anytime I needed to contact them and they would sort everything so I could be as stress free as possible. Sounded so wonderful to me but that is not how its been at all. Seems like a sham to me. Only phone calls i've had resulted in me being told excitedly but wrongly that I didn't need chemo which resulted in raising my hopes falsely. I was told if I had any problems with transport just to ring but when I did ring I was told I had to sort it out myself.Feel like i've wasted 3 months of my life hanging around waiting.  Looks like I will probably have to fork out and buy a wig myself. I'm not that keen on trying the cold cap considering I don't even like going outside in this cold spell of weather without my wooly hat on even for a short time, losing my hair seems preferable to enduring a cold head. I think the slogan on adverts saying  living with cancer should be changed to waiting with cancer. I wish staff had just been honest with me at the beginning and not painted this false rosy picture of caring. I know there's many cancer sufferers and i'm just a number to them but they shouldn't have pretended i'm not. Sorry to be so negative because i had beenI trying to be upbeat about my cancer for the sake of my family.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Vicky, funny enough not long after I posted I got a phone call back from my BCN. She said I would be able to go and choose a wig and have it put aside for collection later. She said she would email them too to let them know. Not ideal but at least it's something. Sorry to hear you have such a long trip there and back for treatment. I was glad my treatment is in my local hospital only 13 miles away but then i've just found out after each chemo cycle I have to see the Oncologist at the cancer care hospital which is 40 miles away so I haven't got out of the long journey after all so will have to rely on transport laid on by a couple of charities. Very thankful for these charities providing transport as I would have been completely stuck. I'm hoping I can manage to drive to and from my chemo.  Good luck with your chemo Vicky xx",

I think i've resigned myself to not looking good for several months and keeping myself hidden under a hat. I'm not one for going out much socialising so at least I don't have to worry about that. To be honest I'm not sure how i'm going to feel emotionally about the change in my looks. I'm hoping I won't let it bother me but you can just never tell how you are going to feel. I did think of going to the hairdressers and getting my hair cut really short then I realised that I didn't feel emotionally strong enough to do that especially sitting trapped in front of their big mirror watching my hair being snipped away, don't think I could handle the sympathy either. I hope you manage to get on the course before your chemo. I'd love to hear what you think of it. Hope you enjoy it, I'm sure you will. Take care xxx",

I'm not a youngster as i'm 62 but it really saddened me to see young people having to cope with cancer. I've been surprised how many people my age or older who once they knew I had cancer have told me that they themselves had suffered from cancer years ago at a much younger age, one of them being 30 years ago. Treatment has come on so much since those days too. Once you get cancer yourself previous cancer sufferers are so ready to support you and share their own experiences.",

The side affects a few days later are unpleasant  but they don't last long. For me day 3 after chemo was the worst but by the following day I could feel myself start to improve slowly and by the second week I was feeling so much better and by week three felt great. On my day 3 I just focused on the knowledge that I just need to get through it although it does seem a long day but knowing it wasn't going to last forever kept me going. You will be given meds to help with the side effects and you will be given contact phone numbers so if you have any concerns you can speak to someone day or night for advice. I don't know much about the T bit of chemo as I only had my first dose yesterday and I have to admit to being very nervous about going on to a different chemo drug, but it went well and i'm feeling great today but I know the side effects will kick in soon and I have no idea how bad they will be but knowing they won't last forever will get me through it. I've had moments during the side affects when I think I can't do this but they have only been brief moments and just me feeling sorry for myself but most of the time i've felt fine and have managed to get on with my life as normal. A lot of people manage to work during chemo usually only having the first week after chemo off. I can't work because my job involves long shifts but I have enjoyed having the free time. Drinking lots of water helps although that can be hard on the days of feeling nauseous but on the days that you can drink as much as possible it does help. They recommend one and a half to two litres a day. Fresh air and walks help with the fatigue. If you can't always manage a walk even just standing or sitting out in the fresh air makes a difference. Waiting as always is the worst but it's surprising how quickly you get through it. Please try not to over think and scare yourself, despite the side effects it is doable. I can\"t believe i\"m at cycle 4 already and only 2 more to go. My experience has been more good days than bad and that's what's made it doable. Sending you lots of good luck and best wishes xxx",
