      "Content": "Hi Nancy Have just been diagnosed with regional recurrence for 2rd time. 1995 lumpectomy chemo radio and tamoxifen. 1999 recurrence in scar tissue mastectomy chemo nd arimidex. 2010 recurrence in scar tissue again am currently on 2nd dose of taxotere and xeloda chem and have 25 sessions of radiotherapy to look forward to. Like you my cancer hasn't spread so at least thats good. Also like you I'm alone a lot as my husband works shift and all kids have left home. Am finding hair loss hardest to deal with particularly in hot weather. Hate wearing wig but am not brave enough to to go out in scarf. Chemo is easier to deal with this time as know what to expect.",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy Have just had my second dose of taxotere. To be honest it's not pleasant but not unbearable. I have it every 3 weeks and have about 5 bad days and then rejoin the human race again till the next time. Side effects for me are flu like symptoms, joint aches and pains, dizziness, very mild nausea, loss of taste, lack of appetite and constipation. This sounds like a lot to put up with but none of them on their own are too bad it's just having the whole lot at the same time leaves you feeling pretty grim. Has your oncologist suggested any other treatment?  I generally ask mine (he's male) what he would reccommend his wife or daughter to do if she were in the same situation. So far the answer has always been to go the most aggressive route. As for the wig and scarves issue. I've just bought some cheap Primark scarves and am having fun experimenting with different ways of arranging them. My first attempts were a bit Hilda Ogden (remember her from Corrie?) but I'm improving and now have different colours and styles to match different outfits. Please let me know what you decide to do as regards your treatment. My cancers have always been oestrogen positive so I don't know how it feels to be in your situation. Best of luck whatever you decide and please keep in touch Good luck Joanna  ",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy I'm so glad you've come to a decision. For what it's worth I'm sure it's the right one. I'm going to have my 3rd dose next week and am coping well so far. The tiredness is really kicking in now, but so far I've managed to keep working and plan to do so as long as I can. Like a lot of people I find the psychological aspect of having cancer worse than the physical and when I was diagnosed this time  at least I knew that I'd done everything that had been recommended so it was just meant to be. I think it would have been harder to cope if I'd refused treatment last time. I hope your friend is feeling ok. I don't know anyone else who is having taxotere. You say this disease makes you mad. Well, mad is good, there's nothing like a good rant and rave to release the tension, you just have to find the right person to let loose with. My chemo nurses are great, they really understand where I'm coming from and they've heard it all before. Good Luck tomorrow and let me know how you get on. Joanna  ",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy Sorry to take so long to reply. I'm due to have my 4th Taxotere on Tuesday. Like you I'm having visual problems my eyes are blurred and constantly running with tears. Everyone keeps asking me why I'm crying. Iwear dark glasses all the time when I'm out. It helps a bit. I'm also having some hand and foot problems can't feel the tips of my fingers and toes. I really feel for people who have long term eye problems. At least we know that it will end when the treatment does. My bloods are good I have to take my temperature twice a day and if it goes up I have to go straight to hospital but its been normal so far. I'm really fed up at this stage. Ifeel sorry for my husband (he's been great). Ihave 1 daughter living at home and she helps a lot and my other daughter comes round a few times a week to help out, I'm very lucky to have them. I hope your bloods are better this time. Hanging round waiting for results is a pain. Try to keep positive I know it's hard but we've both been through this before and know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Wishing you all the best and let me know how you're getting on.
