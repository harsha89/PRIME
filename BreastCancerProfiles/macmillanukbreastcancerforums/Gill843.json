    "Content": "Help please. I was diagnosed in September with a triple negative grade 3 ductal carcinoma non lymph and had my lumpectomy and reconstruction done at Glan Clwyd Hospital in North Wales on 6th October. I am now due to start the first of six FEC-T chemotherapy on Wednesday 12th November and I am now shitting myself! I have a massive fear of needles and this does not help either as I am also a diabetic (Type 1.5 insulin and tablets controlled) so have completely covered needles to inject with. I had decided to try the cold cap but as I am a very cold person anyway am now very reluctant to try it and have already asked my hairdresser to come and see me next week to shave my hair off (I've only just paid Â£70 to have colour put in it for my brothers wedding last month!) but feel that I should embrace being bold and ensuring that the chemo goes to every part to make sure it does not come back. My 15 year old daughter came with me to shop for winter woolly hats on Sunday so I'm trying my best to include her in any decisions that I need to take. My husband works shifts, my son is at University in Carmarthen and my daughter is in year 10. They are so supportive of any decisions that I make! I'm feeling very nervous today, most probably because I'm fearing the unknown, but also trying to be as positive as possible as I have my son's graduation to go to in July next year and also my brother and his wife are paying for a return ticket for me to go over to see them in Australia once I have recovered! My biggest worry is how they will give me the chemo. I've heard on this site many saying that they have a cannular and others say they have had a picc? What is the difference? I also understand that I have to have my bloods taken a couple of days before every treatment? I usually have blood taken every three months to check my Hb1ac with my diabetes and I hate having it done! Does everybody have to have steroids? And if so how does one take them and how often? If there is anybody out there that can help to put my mind at ease I would be very grateful Thanks",
