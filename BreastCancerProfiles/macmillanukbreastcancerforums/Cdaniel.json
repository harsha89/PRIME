I did decide to have chemo first and just after having 2 chemo sessions my lump has shrunk from 5cm's to 2.5cm's. Wow I feel like I've won the lottery. We can do this, keep fighting, laughing & loving everyone. Love Cheryl XxX",

Wow I couldn't believe it, the news actually made me cry. With 5 sessions to go, hopefully it keeps shrinking. Feel fantastic.... Love Cheryl Xx",
