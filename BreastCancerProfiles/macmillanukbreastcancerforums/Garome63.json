      "Content": "I found an indent on my breast but no lump and thought at first it was just stretch marks, but after looking for signs of breast cancer (I only did this because a friend has just had a breast removed and as she didn't have any symptoms) I thought I better visit my G P who immediately referred me to the breast clinic. I got a letter the following day to go to a breast surgery  unit but not for another 5 weeks.   I cant stop checking my breasts and have now found a red line my armpits which feels a bit lumpy. My head is all over the place as I dont know what to think. 5 weeks seems a long time to wait.",

      "Content": "Thank you Lesley. I actually rang them up today but no cancellations but Im going to ring them up daily to try and get an earlier date. I think it is the delay which is causing the most anxiety. I had a mamogram last September which didnt show anything so Im hoping that is good news. I also need to stop looking at cancer symtoms on different websites as I'm tormenting myself. Is this normal? I know I will deal with whatever comes but I just need to know what it is. ",
