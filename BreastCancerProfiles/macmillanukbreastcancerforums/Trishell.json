I am trying very hard not to keep dwelling on it but it is hard!  Radiographer seemed pretty convinced it was a carcinoma so am prepared for the worst.

      "Content": "Hi Bushy Sounds like we are both in much the same boat.  There was some debate on my 'team' apparently as to whether I should have chemo first to shrink everything and then do the surgery, but I have a small bust and the lump is right behind the nipple which they would have to take anyway, so couldn't see any reason not to just get on with the mastectomy.  Although I haven't had the lymph node results yet, the radiographer seemed to think they would be affected as well, so they will be doing an axillary clearance at the same time.  Now that it is sinking in, I just want to get on with it and start the journey to recovery!  You don't need to feel sorry for upsetting your family - you didn't do this on purpose, and you may well be surprised at how well they deal with it.  My daughters were amazingly supportive when I told them, and I'm sure your sons will be the same.  Get another bottle of that red wine out, and have a glass or two!  I am on my second glass this evening!

Most people seem to have nodes taken out.   Someone on here told me that the ct scan is to check that you are ok for surgery, and obviously they check everything else at the same time.  The whole thing is a bit of a nightmare, but the sooner we start, then the sooner we finish!  I have been talking to close friends, plus some other people I had to contact to change appointments etc and without exception, everyone has been very supportive.  And it is also amazing how many people have said they have relatives and close friends who have been throughor are going through  the same thing, so I feel more positive after talking to them.  I have two daughters, three grandsons and a ginger cat, who adopted us when we moved here ten years ago!

Regarding the injections, I was shown how to do them and since then having been doing them myself which makes life a bit easier.  It's not difficult if you are ok with injections as it is a very slim needle. I noticed after the first five that I had a bit of back pain which they said was the bone marrow doing its job. Didn't get much the second time. hope you feel better soon xxx",

I have loads of books and plays and podcasts on it and I find it really helps to have a virtual person reading me to sleep! You can buy lots of second hand audiobooks, and there are lots of dramas on bbc which you can download as podcasts.  Best to stick to fairly light undemanding stuff though, as you will probably sleep through quite a bit of it!  ",
