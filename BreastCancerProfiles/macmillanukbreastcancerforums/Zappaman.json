      "Content": "My old mother used to get rid of cradle cap on the grandchildren by using baby oil massaged into the scalp, then gently removing the dry skin with a bone comb after leaving the oil to soak in for a while. I have used baby oil and sometimes brylcream. I hope this helps, just remember that all shampoo unless totally natural contains a mild form of engine degreaser ( sodium laureate sulphate ) I think which doesn't help a dry scalp. Regards Frank",

      "Content": "Are you aware that urea is extracted from urine ? Many products contain extracts from mare's urine, eye drops and even the birth control pill was from pregnant mare's urine. Urine is not a waste product of the body or it would leave by the other end. Babies are in urine for the duration of pregnancy, the use of urine therapy is developed from Hinduism and is known as shivambu, a very interesting subject. There has been a great deal of research into human urine and it's uses but not widely promoted as you don't have to buy it as you produce your own. Regards Frank",

      "Content": "To all of you strong ladies out there, ( especially the ones who don't yet realise how strong you are ) it's great to see the support you give to one another. My wife had a small tumour removed from her breasts two years ago and radiotherapy and a tamoxifen daily, she's doing fine now. I joined the online community site and the oesophageal cancer section, I had surgery in October 2016 and I'm on the road to recovery, I decided to ignore the statistics and just get on with my life as best as I can. Every time I log onto this site I am constantly amazed at the amount of women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and the list is added to daily. I am disappointed with this as it's so common now, I wonder after all the years of research why is the numbers diagnosed growing. It's now being stated that 1 in 2 people will get cancer, my brother died in 1976 at the age of 19 with cancer. It was a shock to everyone in the community, now it's just accepted as the norm. It's just about a guarantee that if you are born a woman you will get breast cancer at some point in your life, which I find shocking. I salute you all keep fighting and supporting each other. Love and hugs to you all. Frank",

You know that you are putting yourself at greater risk coming into contact with people you know have a cold. The people around you who love you don't want you to risk it, so close to the operation. It's natural all the thoughts going through your head, all the \" what ifs \" the worries and anxiety. You live in a beautiful part of the world, you have beautiful daughters and a loving caring husband. Try to picture, after a successful operation and treatment you will be able to see and hug your family germ free and healthy. It's worth the wait, I think you really want to get the operation over with so I don't think you should risk it. May your beliefs and hope's see you through. Positive thoughts to you and best wishes.",

      "Content": "JoJo, I know it was a long time ago but when I was 15 my brother who was 17 was diagnosed with cancer and It was terminal. I am the youngest of 9 children and my father Â killed in a mining cave in when I was 4 1/2 . My mother was a very strong character and decided that I should not be told that my brother had cancer. That was 42 years ago and I have only discussed It with my family recently that I resented them all for that long for NOT TELLING ME. So I can understand that you are trying to protect him but he will hate you if you hide things from him. He is obviously intelligent and seems mature enough for his age to deal with it. I can only talk about what I experienced by not being told, but it's your call and I wish you all the best and no one can judge you whatever you think is for the best. Good luck and God bless you and your family",
