I explained this to the hospital and they have made sure all my appointments fit in around my child care arrangements as they are keen not to add to my stress.  I am sure that your team will want the same for you, so do explain to them about your holiday plans. I can understand what you mean about being unfair on your son, I feel the same, I haven't booked any holiday yet but we have been having days out inbetween treatments to make up for it.    Good luck Ivorymummy.   Ax   ",

Things I have needed money for have been: two sports bras and an expander parking at £3 a day at the hospital with numerous visits it can be expensive luckily friends have stepped in to help with the following otherwise I could not have managed: childcare - costs would have been breakfast clubs, afterschool club, child minder for other times. housework - i cant manage the hoover, washing, changing the beds, cleaning the bathroom etc, so if my friends weren't popping in to do it for me, i would need to pay someone. shopping, cost of delivery as I cant do it myself, and extra costs buying food that is easy to prepare as I cant use the oven  or lift heavy pans. hairdresser - I havent been able to wash my hair for the last few weeks, not possible for a friend to do it at home as i cant lean over the sink, so I have been to the hairdressers for a wash and blow dry once a week.   I was very fortunate to receive a gift of money so I took my child for a couple of days to lego land too as an adventure before the final surgery - it was great and it gave us both something other than the cancer to focus on and enjoy and something to aim for when I will be well enough to go again. It was like our own 'make a wish'   ",

I am frustrated massively with the fatigue and the impact it has, my house is a mess i just can't manage what I used to. The hardest part of my recovery is coming to terms with just how much I have been forced to change, how many compromise s I have to make and coming to terms with my new limitations. I Intrepid sums it up very well. We are changed but we have survived We are changed but are alive. I am being bulldozed in to taking on more at work, more hours, responsibility more hassle! All that the folks at the meeting could see was the old ME and were stunned that I didn't want to take on this extra work! I could do withnthe extra money God only knows how hard it is to manage, but the emotional and physical cost is too high and its impacting on my precious time with my daughter. So my current battle is not only for me to accept the new ME but the folks around me to accept and understand too. So with Intrepids words in mind, I am going to take out the But.... I am changed I survived I am changed I am alive Love and God's blessing to u all x",

I also havent told many people either, as for the times I had to, the look on their faces was more than I could cope with, and I had to keep telling myself its because they care for me and that has made it a bit easier, it has got to the stage i can't keep it a secret as I have had so many appointments already and two surgeries and a third planned, and treatment after that unknown.   Keeping control of your life is important i have had  lovely well meaning friends wanting to come in and do everything, but I want to do as much as i can for me and my daughter and that has been hard to explain to them, especially as everyone offers to take her out to give me 'a break'  so I have to explain I do not need a break from my child (every well moment with her is priceless) but if they want to do the ironing for a hour that would be great!.  I love the idea of a lego fund Ethel as after my first op the flowers and plants at home where beautiful but became difficult to look after.  My daughter is just 6 so I will think of something similiar, it will certainly help me knowing she has a treat to look forward to. the advice I have been given by a friend who is recovering from cancer, is to be selfish...think what is good for you and your immediate family and stick to it.   There are goverment guidelines on how soon you should be seen.  Give your breast care nurse a call and maybe she can help you. good luck :)   x ",

      "Content": "Hi Mum of two, sounds like a melt down is just what you needed to relieve the stress of it all.  I have had a few of those myself and I am still waiting for my mx.   Also an f cup and have been told its a big op and will be a difficult recon.      Agree with aroma mum   talking about it does help and doing something which requires minimal effort like having a friend round who will make the tea and talk about normal things other than the cancer as well!    Also, having a good old cry and rant and moan to let the emotions out has worked for me!  I had a good cry last night - on my ex's shoulder, he doesn't do emotions either but he listened and didn't mind his t-shirt getting wet!   After my previous 2 ops  I told everyone I was ignoring the house work,  but I wanted to do as much with my daughter as possible and that has helped.  Friends have offered their time to help out  again with the housework post op and that has kept me going too as I know i am not fighting this alone - and the best bit is I know I am fighting it for the best reason - my 6 year old!   I do hope you have not got an infection and the latest trip to hospital to close the wound had worked.  and i hope your husband can talk about it with you.   I think breast cancer is like being put on a fast moving roller coaster, one minute you are plunged down with bad news, feeling awful the next rushed to a high point when good news or something life affirming happens.  there is not much straight run at the moment but that will get better - see the thread one year on from diagnosis day.... the very best wishes to you mum of two, i really really hope that you start healing well soon.   big hugs xx",

I am no eligible for sick pay and havent been able to work for two months.     I haven't tried claiming anything yet but will have to try soon as running out of money, Macmillan said to try the replacement to invalidity benefit but the prospect of the stress of doing so in the midst of handling the surgery has been too much!! Macmillian did say that sometimes disability living allowance may be payable - have you tried that? Has anyone else been successful claiming benefits to help out? Any advice?",

I was so incredibly relieved to hear they got it all and like you my lymph nodes were clear, I simply wouldn't have taken it all in. Now part of me wants to know the extent of what they found and part of me is too scared to ask! I admire you for being so informed. I do hope your post op recovery is going well. Its hard at times living with what happened it was surreal at times! Happy to chat about post op recovery etc. Do hope you able to rest and the pain is manageable.",

In my case a mx meant that the percentage point benefits of chemo v tamoxifen were only 2 percent difference in chemos favour but that had to be weighed up against how I would tolerate and cope wigh the chemo for 6 months and then recovery after that. My medical team recommended tamoxifen and I wonder if my social situation swayed their recommendation as I am a lone parent so coping with u months of chemotherapy would have been v v tough. So I am hoping and praying that its the right choice. V emotional about it still lots of tears but I am more or less back to normal whatever that is, and if I was on chemo well I would be only half way through. I guess in a way having an er tumour has meant I got a choice when other patients dont get one. I also met a lovely lady who said no to the tamoxifen following her treatment as the predictor computer showed only a 2 percent advantage she weighed up the potential effect on her quality of life as her immediate health was v important to her. Wishing you and everyone who has to decide the awful to think about options the very very best. Blessings x",

It could be that the surgeon didn't mention it YET as u have had so much to deal with up till now. You should havd been given a contact number for the specialist plastic surgery nurse, give her a call and ask away!
