    "Content": "Hi Supersue Has anyone tested you for neutropoenia?  It sounds as if perhaps you might have a low blood count in some way which is why you are getting all these infections.  Have you been in touch with the chemo nurses or seen your oncologist? It took me 5 months to get my full energy back following my chemo and radio.  You can't rush it as you have absolutely no reserves of energy.  Once the energy pot is empty, it takes a while to fill it up, so rest as long as you need to do and thank your wonderful partner for doing all the things he does for you.  He sounds one in a million!  Just rest, exercise as much as you can without overdoing it, and eat sensibly.  Avoid alcohol as it makes you more tired!",
