    "Content": "Hi SImba I was diagnosed with BC at the beginning of Feb, had 1st chemo, 5 more to go then surgery. I'm just about managing to keep to 5 a day but really struggling to stop completely, I read your comment about people thinking that because you've been diagnosed with cancer you can just stop. Its the most stressfull thing i've ever been through. Good to know i'm not the only smoker!Â  Hope your treatment is going ok, best wishes to you Bea x",
