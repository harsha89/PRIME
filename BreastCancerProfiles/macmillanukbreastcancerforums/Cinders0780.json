    "Content": "Hi, just read your post. Sorry of your news. I have just recently been diagnosed and I have had my first chemo session, my next is next Thursday. I will also have surgery and maybe radiation too. I am 37 with a 16 year old and a 14 month old. It\u2019s certainly a lot to take in and everything runs through your head. Its heartbreaking news and I still can\u2019t believe it is real. Think once you\u2019ve seen your oncologist and got a treatment plan in place you\u2019ll prob feel a bit better. You\u2019ll be assigned a breast cancer nurse who will support you aswell, mines really lovely. It deffo turns your world upside down but we have to be strong and brave for our little ones. Sending you lots of love through this difficult time x",
