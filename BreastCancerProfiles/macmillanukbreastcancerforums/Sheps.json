      "Content": "Dear all  I'am wondering if anyone could help me or has any advise.  I had my 1st session of AC chemotherapy 4 days ago. Can anyone tell me when my immune system is at its lowest point? My daughter has just got the chicken pox and I'am concerned, even though I have already had chicken pox when I was a child. I'm still worried about getting shingles.  Does any one have and advise on this? Many thanks in advance  Best regard Sheps ",
