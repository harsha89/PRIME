      "Content": "Hi Barfy I kniw your feeling .....i'm due for my mammogram in 10 days time & it scares me. I think i coping well then suddenly i feel things & instantly think \"whats that?\"  It can be controlling but i think i'm settling down although it never leaves my thoughts....still early days. I'm returning properly to work after a phased return to work since january so this will be the time which tells me how my body will cope physically....mentally its good to be returning back  to kind of  normal but hopefully in time & after my mammogram i will relax. Its good to check so then you know your body & if anything does appear you've caught it quickly. Hope this helps a little x",

      "Content": "Hi x i was in the same position as you ....had lump removed & test came back a score of 26. I was told it was borderline & my choice to have chemo. It was a hard decision at the time but after a second chat with my oncologist & i asked him if/whether he could advise me & he said \" if it was a member of my family ....definitely\"!  Also talking with family helped ....my brother said \"if you're given a little bit of hope grab it \" we've lost members of family who would of done anything to have just a little bit of hope!  Anyway i went ahead & i'm pleased i did ....i think i would always be thinking if i hadn't done everything it might return. I'm not saying chemo is easy but it is doable .....it does have its side effects as does radiotherapy and i still wonder if its gone but i know i've done everything in my power to minimise a occurrance x hope this helps x i have my first mammogram check up next week & i'm still worried but i know i'm in good hands & it has to be done x",

      "Content": "Hi x every thing you say sounds so much what i've been through in the last 12 months!  The courses are good & defo recommend look good feel good session .....something different rather than treatment....makes you feel good like they say. I'm now on tamoxifen for 5 years....side effects easing with therapies such as massage/reflexolody/yoga & acupuncture all provided by the Marsden for limited number of times. I'm on a phased return to work....my jobs quite physical so my body is reacting to things i'm now doing again  & its really hard to reduce my duties but i have to listen to what my body is saying .....take things slowly & ask for help when needed....i'm hoping things will become easier but mentally its good to be back in the work place ....gives me something else to think about but its always there in the back of my mind .....just need to remember like you say \"one of the lucky ones!!\" Live your life xx",

It was just the infection side effects that threw me & i don't want to over think these & worry about germs etc. I will prob be to pre occupied with the cooling cap to read amuse myself but i'm on my 2 cycle i will be more relaxed knowing what to expect. I have a visit to the unit today which i hope to relax me & prepare me for tomoz, my partner will be there for support too with his paper. Thsnk you for your advise.",
