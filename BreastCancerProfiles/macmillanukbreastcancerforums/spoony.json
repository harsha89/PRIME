    "Content": "hi there, i just had a mastectomy last friday with an immediate reconstruction to my left breast.  i havent really had a look at whats going on with it yet, too scary?  have to see the breast care nurse tomorrow morning.  i too have a large breast and the reconstruction is a lot smaller?  my surgeon said i will hate it at first but after about a year it will be fine.  he said he will reduce my other breast and uplift it?  i dont know what sort of implant was used yet, will find out all the gory details tomorrow.  that must have been awful going through the lumpectomy and then having to have the mastectomy.  do you have to have any further treatment, i am dreading the appointment in a few weeks to get my results.  hope its gone and if it does come back not for a good few years.  hope youre gonna be okay xxx",
