    "Content": "Hi all I'm new to the Macmillan community. I am having a wobble! I was diagnosed with high grade DCIS in May this year.  I had 2 x WLE to get clear margins and followed by course if radiotherapy which I finished 4 weeks ago. Now it's all sinking in. In your experience does it reoccur and am I higher risk for other breast now? Thank you ladies. ",
