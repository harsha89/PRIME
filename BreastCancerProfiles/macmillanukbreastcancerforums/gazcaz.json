      "Content": "Hi Sorry to hear your arm causing problems! My arm seems to be playing up lately too, i have a pic line in and have been aching and having trouble getting blood from it etc!! Sorry to hear also your margins wasn't clear and you need another op!! i was lucky enough to have clear margins as i caught it quite early, so hope after chemo and 4 weeks of radio therapy i will be done!! I also can't wait to get my life back as i'm always exhausted and my head is so cloudy i can't seem to think straight!!!  That's awful your are going through a divorce, BIG HUGS,keep in touch, and i hope everything turns out well for you after your op, and you get back to full health.....   Caz, xxxx",
