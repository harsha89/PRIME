    "Content": "Hello, I got my wonderful wig from the local Macmillan Support Centre at the hospital. Had to fill in a form but that was about it. They had a professional hairdresser there who fitted and cut it to suit me. They also advised on how to care for it. Do contact Macmillan to see where your nearest Centre is. Best wishes and hang on in there.",
