    "Content": "Hi my mother in law was diagnosed with breast cancer around 2 years ago. She had a lumpectamony and radiotherapy and seemed to be all clear. That is until last month when we received the news that she has a new lump in her breast and further scans have also shown she has cancer on her ovaries and lower back. Although she now has these secondary cancer she is not having any surgery or chemo as apparently she has a level 8 oestrogen based cancer so the doctors are saying that the hormonal therapy stopping the oestrogen supply will be enough to stop it all. oh and she is having one big does of radiotherapy again on her lower back. Im in a hard place as my own mother died of breast cancer when i was 7 and she was only 41, my step aunt died of it and numerous other people i know have so i find it very hard to believe that simply taking a tablet will stop it all. Will it? Has anyone been in this situation and survived?",
