      "Content": "Hello everyone, new here but lumpectomy last December and started AC in January. Finished last of four by three weekly AC three weeks ago which was ok. On Thursday I start taxol (paclitaxel) weekly for 12 weeks. Herceptin every three weeks. Herceptin will continue for another 9 months. Radio starts in August daily for 6 weeks. It will be very helpful to discuss experiences in the coming months. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Oh Cartwheels sorry you are spending the weekend with shingles and uncertainly of having chemo. Who would have thought we'd be concerned about not having it. I was due to start first taxol and herceptin last Thursday but taxol postponed for three weeks. CT scan showed some thickening of colon wall which my oncologist thinks may be from 4 doses of AC. I was devastated but holding onto the fact that I have had my first herceptin at last. Cartwheels I do hope your oncologist gives you good news tomorrow and that your chemo goes ahead. ",
