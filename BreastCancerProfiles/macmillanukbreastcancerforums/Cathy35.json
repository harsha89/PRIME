    "Content": "Hi. I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in September 2016 ( I have/ had liver mets). I had 6 rounds of FEC chemo, and have been on hormone therapy since that finished. I was only 35 when diagnosed (with 3 children under 5), and since I was diagnosed stage 4, absolutely desperate and looking into lots of complementary and alternative therapies/ approaches. I found a paper that showed that chemo was more effective in mice who had been fasted beforehand. I didn't manage the 48 hours before chemo that the paper used, but fasted the day before chemo, the day of chemo and tried to eat an earlier dinner the day before chemo. I had chemo on Wednesday mornings, would eat my dinner at 6pm on Monday night, and then not eat again until 8-9am on Thursday morning. So I fasted for 60-65 hours. I was only sick once following chemo - my second chemo, I was so hungry and ate some nuts whilst having the chemo in hospital. I regretted it and managed to keep the fast the other times. I think it worked for me.  I am doing much better than expected and had a liver resection in June of this year, and have just had a mastectomy and full node clearance. I am still considered \"incurable\", and still plan on making a full and miraculous recovery. ",
