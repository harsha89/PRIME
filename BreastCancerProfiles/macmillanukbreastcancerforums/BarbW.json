      "Content": "Thanks everyone.  Yeh I've had gene testing haven't got the BRAC mutations but have high risk of getting bc due to family history. I've done loads of research into TN so understand benefits of chemo but you still feel bit helpless as other bc have a back up plan with hormone related drugs etc. However after your information I am going to ask Oncology dept about the blood samples for reassurance. I have a lack of confidence with my hospital,  so many things not gone smoothly which I won't go into as would take for ever. I have put in lots of emails with 'feedback' to different departments.   I'm also looking at going to another hospital for 2nd opinion.  I know nothing more available but just for reassurance. I'm in NW England if anyone has any suggestions?  Thinking maybe Glasgow or Edinburgh.  I am social media savvy & am following US based TN but can't find anything UK based. Don't know anyone else with TN so that doesn't help.  Have asked macmillan nurse if they can approach a fellow TN who could chat with me. Hey.  I'm glad I joined up on this. Thanks x    ",

      "Content": "Hi thanks MM. Yeh it was just a locum that signed me off. I see different doc everytime I go! A different oncologist had said few months ago that I would get a blood test to check for changes in cells? Just wondered if any one knew anything about them.  Will maybe go back& discuss why I am told different things.  Doesn't help does it. Thanks  ",
