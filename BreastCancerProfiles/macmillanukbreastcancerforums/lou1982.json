I want the expander to be repostioned but apparently that us difficult to do because of scar tissue. I told him i wouldnt be having expander filled as it is hecause it will make me feel worse about myself than i do already ",

      "Content": "Hi all I visited the breast clinic today with a view to start having my expander filled to start giving me some shape now that i have finished chemotherapy. My breast consultant that i was under has left so i got to meet my new consultant today for the first time. After examining me, he informed me that the expander had moved so now once it has been filled it will look abnormal. My old consultant has never once mentioned to me that the expander had moved. I am now thinking that is why he was reluctant to fill it and adviced me to wait untill chemotherapy was over. Has anyone else had problems with expanders moving?? Tia",

      "Content": "Hi helen Sorry to hear that you are experiencing complications. I had  a mastectomy  on the 7th of april and 2 weeks later my wound also turned necrotic. I had an operation to remove  the dead tissue and one week later the wound was not healing and had opened up. My consultant didnt want to rush to theatre and remove the expander unless it was the last resort. I had a vacuum assisted dressing applied called a pico. This was changed twice a week and was stopped altogether last week. My wound has almost healed now and i will be starting chemo next week. With all of the above surprisingly my chemo was delayed by only 2 weeks.  I didnt realise until I went through this how common necrosis after a mastectomy was x",
