      "Content": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone had chosen not to have chemotherapy? I had a grade 3 stage 1 ductal triple negative (hormones and HER-2 negative) which thankfully hadn't spread to my lymph or to the vascular, so it was contained and all removed. It has been recommended that I have chemo and radiotherapy as a \"precaution\", but as far as the surgeon is concerned, all the cancer has been removed (thank god). He did say that I had to weigh up the pros and cons of having any further treatment. I have decided that I won't be having chemo (unless there is something I don't know) and I am pretty doubtful about having radiotherapy either. It would have been a different ball game had it have spread at all, but it hasn't. I personally am very against chemotherapy for many reasons (I won't blather on about them here, as I don't want to even marginally influence anyone else's decision). I know that no-one \"wants\" to have chemo, but I was wondering if anyone has been in the same, or similar position to me and decided not to have any further treatment? Many thanks Julie",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, Thanks very much for the info. I'm so glad you've had minimal problems with the radiotherapy. That's very good news. To be honest I didn't know much about radiotherapy really until I started digging. I didn't realise that there were any serious side effects with it, but it appears that with radio for breast cancer, due to the area where the radiation is applied it can quite significantly raise your chances of lung cancer. This was my big issue with it. Previously I smoked heavily for more years than I care to admit and feel that I have helped myself along enough down the lung cancer route without upping my chances!! Have you heard anything about this? Julie x",
