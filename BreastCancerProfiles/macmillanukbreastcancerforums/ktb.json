    "Content": " Well... I've just been discharged on Friday having been in hospital since the 15th Sept with the above illness, there I was thinking I was tired and sore from my Radiotherapy and all along I've gone and got some obsure auto immune illness, ahh bless, and I thought Chemo was bad, this is a nightmare. My body acts the muscles and skin, resulting in a horrible skin rash and the more painfull and disabling muscles pain I've ever had, I also couldn't speak and I'm still having real problems eating as its attacked my muscle in my throat, mind you its a really good way to looses weight. Apparently, this illness can be linked to Breast Cancer, so I've had Bone scans, CT Scan, waiting for a PET scan, also had my nerves fired up with electro-currents and my muscle damage tested.... Its all quite pants really, they have me on high dosage steroid and are slowly going to try and swap me to an auto immune suppressor drug as that is less damaging to the body in the long run. I can't walk very well so I'm getting pushed around in a wheelchair, and doing even a simple task is completely draining. I was wondering if anyone else had ever some across this illness, my consultant says I'm his 3rd case in 8 years so its not that common, but the fact it can be linked to about 4 cancers, I thought maybe someone else here might have had it and may have some tips for me on how long its going to take before I can use my arms and legs like they should be....cause its driving me mad.   Otherwise, Its great to be home in my own bed, but the guys in the hospital were great.   Kate x",
