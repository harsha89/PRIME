The dr that did the biopsy said \"you can't walk around with that inside you, even if it turns out to be benign\" The dr I initially went to when I found the lump was evasive about results saying \"there are some abnormal cells but I haven't had all the results\" Surgeon said \"you have a large cancerous tumour, we'll need to operate, didn't your doctor tell you?\" So I guess it varies a lot! I went to all those appointments alone too.  In retrospect it might have been nice to have someone with me but I didn't really plan and my husband was busy having an affair at the time in another country!",

Gillie, not sure there's any chocolate left but will have warm bath, cover myself with moisturiser and get a good night's rest then call the dr tomorrow.  Lindy - took temperature (37.1) and then later 36.9 so I think I should be fine for the night at least. It's just annoying to have to take the kids to school on the metro with all the coughers and sneezers around on low immunity days.  I am planning to send them alone (ages 13 and 8) but the older one has his exchange student so they might chat to each other and ignore/lose the little one!

Husband is obviously feeling v guilty but is completely defensive and unsympathetic.  If I cry he says \"You got what you wanted, I've come back, you've had the operation, you don't have cancer any more what are you upset about\" (apparently it makes him feel stressed if other people, especially women, are upset.) I want him to acknowledge that yes, he is in an embarrassing and crappy position but lots of it is due to his choice.  I didn't choose to have cancer and I don't \"choose\" to feel upset. Please don't try to cheer me up by telling me my husband is a shit, he probably is but my sons and I love him and he loves us too in his own weird way (I think he probably has some kind of Asperger's) Anyway, didn't want to rant about myself, was going to offer sympathy.

He compared it to having a cold (for which I believe there is also no \"cure\")  He's changed his tune a bit since it came back and the oncologist said there was nothing they could do to \"cure\" it. Obviously people are not very aware for what cancer actually is.  (and it doesn't help that doctors don't really know either, grrr)",

I went away for a weekend after FEC 2 , then a week after FEC 3 (much more expensive t go on holiday in france at the last minute than to go abroad! I also spent 10 days in Germany after the last FEC. Started Taxotere on Thursday (i.e. it's about day 5) and apart from a bit f joint pain yesterday and some stomach discomfort today I feel OK.  Much more energy than with th FEC though then I suddenly lost it all around 6pm.  Am planning to go to Scotland for a week between Tax 2 and 3. I've also travelled to and from London between treatments for various reasons - I guess as long as there is a hospital nearby ...  C",

On the plus side, I am doing a distance learning course so can focus on my studies, and needless to say my kids are really happy to have a stay at home mum to take them to school and pick them up.  (my husband recently started a job in Luxembourg and is being a bit flaky.  Just before I was diagnosed he told me he'd been having an affair and wanted to get divorced but now is being supportive - when he can - he comes nearly every weekend.  But he is still in touch with his \"girlfriend\" while talking about our moving to Luxembourg to live with him) Argh!  Stress!

My periods stopped after FEC number 3.  I finished Tax at the end of November and had no flushes/sweating until the beginning of February when I woke up many times in the night feeling hot (but no abnormal sweating).  Since I finished radiotherapy (mid April) I have started having sweats in the night again (have to get up and change clothes). I wanted to know what other people's experiences were.  Will this stop/calm down in time?  Is there anything I can do to stop it (I've cut down on coffee and alcohol).  I read somewhere about wild yam supplements but don't know if these are available in France or whether it's effective.  the sweating is really annoying (only at night, am fine during the day).  We went away for the weekend and I had to take extra nightclothes with me! I'm 43.  For those of you whose periods came back, how long did it take? Caroline",

I did mention all of this to my physio and doctor and they were less worried, as was the nurse at the hospital",
