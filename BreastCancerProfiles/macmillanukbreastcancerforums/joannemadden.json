      "Content": "Hi all Just got back from my first oncologist appt today and she's decided to put me on 6 cycles of Doxorubicin and Docetaxel. Just those two. I thought I'd be getting FEC--T like most of us on here. Now my oncologist says its because she wants to lower the risk of me losing my fertility because I'm only 34 and I would like more children. I feel like I've been given these chemos to keep cost down as they didn't even offer me fertility treatment despite my BCN knowing how important it is to me. Have I been fobbed off due to cost cuttings? I've triple neg if that helps? Joanne",

      "Content": "Hi Carole When I was given my biopsy results I had a breast care nurse in with me, so once the consultant had told me that it was a cancerous lump, he disappeared and the bcn took over and sat me down in another room and went through everything. What I had, what treatment was next, gave me a breast pack with info, her contact numbers. My next stage was to book me in for a pre-op ready for surgery the following week, lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. My bcn rings me twice a week to check in on me and to answer those daft questions that pop up in the night! I am currently waiting my results from the surgery which is when they'll tell me the stage, grade etc and what my next course of treatment is. This whole process is done in small steps at a time, It appears that we have a biopsy/surgery, then results weeks after, then treatment booked in weeks after that. I found that hard to digest at first as I wanted everything doing that week for fear that it's growing and spreading! But the time in between gives you time to get your head in gear and understand the processes of what's going on. Good luck with your results and just take a deep breath and one step at a time. We are all here and together we will all get through it. Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi there babychops, Just read your post, I'm also new on here. I'm guessing that all hospitals in different trusts work in different ways. I had a core biopsy, scan and mammogram after suffering from pain and subsequently finding a lump (3cm). The results came back positive and I was booked in 6 days later to have sentinel node biopsy and wide local excision. This was done on Monday and I was discharged on Weds. I now have to wait 7-10 days for the results to see if it's in my lymph nodes. When you see your consultant on Weds they will advise you the best possible course of action, you should also have a breast care nurse who will be able to go over things in more detail with you, and answer all those little daft questions that will pop into your head. I'm here should you need to chat. Joanne Aged 34 (just!) with a 5 yr old beautiful son Diagnosed with IDC awaiting full path report after WLE & SNB",

      "Content": "Hi Carole I was in a similar position to you, grade 3, no node involvement and strongly offered chemo (was told I'd be daft not too). My first fear was losing my hair - it's long and as taken me 18 months to grow it like it is. I also feel well and didn't want to put my body thru all the chemo. But after a week, I got my head around it, read thru other people's experiences and made a decision. It's 6-12 months out of my whole life, that's all. And if chemo zaps that one tiny cell that may be lurking about then it could save my life. I am a single mum to a 5 yr old and have very little family, I need to be able to work to pay for the mortgage etc and luckily my employer (so far) has been very good and we have decided that when I'm well enough I will work. I will be doing lighter desk duties in a private room so I can be isolated better and less risk of infection. I feel that even if I work one day a week that it will help me mentally (aswell as save my sick pay!). I start 6 cycles of Adraimycyin and Taxotere on Tuesday, I had a PiCC line fitted on Thursday and I went to choose my wig on Weds, so I'm all ready for the off. I was quite surprised at the wig to be be honest as I've gone for a short bob, which I've already started to wear! Everyone thinks I've just had my own hair cut and coloured! This helps me mentally as I know that (at the moment) I still have my own hair underneath. No one will know any difference, unless I choose to let them know, it's that control that I still have that is helping me through this. Add me as a friend and I'll gladly chat to you more if you need to. I think you already 'know' in your heart what your decision is, it's just saying it out loud that's the hard bit. Hugs and thoughts are with you ...... Jo x",
