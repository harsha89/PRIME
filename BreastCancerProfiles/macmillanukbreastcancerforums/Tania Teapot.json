      "Content": "Thank S, I will be popping my baps out at anyone who may be in the know! Lol I will definitely tell the oncologist, I just wish the appointment would come sooner! I have been told that I will be having genetic testing, with two blood daughters, a granddaughter on the way and a niece I'm more worried about them, but I'm a firm believer that stress and worry don't change the outcome so don't waste the energy (easier said than done but I try not to dwell)Â  Thanks again for the advice, I'm very grateful TT xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I had a full hysterectomy 4 weeks ago where they found a 20cm cyst on right ovary, 5cm on left, cells in the omentum and 2 affected lymph nodes. I suspected it was ovarian cancer from the start so the results didn't surprise me. I've been recovering well but on Wednesday I found a lump in my breast. I've been to the dr who is going to do a 2 week referral to the Brest clinic. I have to say that this has been the biggest blow so far. I'm due to see the oncologist on 12th of June. As everyone says, the waiting is excruciating! I had posted on the ovarian cancer group where someone kindly suggested writing on here. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks TT xxx",
