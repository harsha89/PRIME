      "Content": "I had a core biopsy because I chose to have a mastectomy instead of a lesser op. and was told that a core biopsy was a way to be certain that it was cancer. So I guess the doc is telling the truth; he suspects, but needs to be 100% certain before he can give you the diagnnosis. If its small, and they've got it early, even if it is cancer there must be an excellent chance that it will be successfully treated. I can hear how anxious you are and send you waves of comfort and many many wishes that all will turn out well. This is a good site for getting comfort from others and lots of useful information too. Please let us know how it goes with you. lots of love, marly",

      "Content": "Actually, when I first found a lump in my breast both my GP and a nurse friend said 'probably not cancer' partly because I did have pain. I believed them and waited two months to see a specialist instead of insisting on a two week referal and of course ended up having a mastectomy. That was Jan 2004 and I had almost 4 years of remission but now its back and its spread. Again, when I reported the lump, just below my collar bone, to the team who were monitoring me, they told me it was nothing to worry about. An ultra sound showed up nothing at all because it was under the muscle tissue. Now, I ask lots of questions, expect to see my notes and so on, but there is still uncertainty. It helps to really take on board that no-one really knows until they open you up and look! I'm getting on with enjoying life! Marly",

For most people, one bout and one treatemnt does it and I so hope that is true for you. I'm having treatment at the moment which is keeping my cancer at bay, so I'm in remission but I still go on wondering how long I'll be OK. Its a huge thing for any of us to deal with. Its a great site and I hope you find it useful and comforting. Big Hug to you, Marlyn",
