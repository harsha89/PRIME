    "Content": "Hi Rachel Sadly achy joints is a side effect of the treatment we've had for our breast cancer.  I was diagnosed in March 2009 and spent the whole of that year undergoing operations, chemo and radiotherapy.  Since Feb 2010 I have been on Tamoxifen for over a year and my Onc has changed this to Femara In January 2012.  I have been prescribed Adcal to protect my poor old bones. But unfortunately the pain in my joints has got worse since my chemo and radio.  I will be on the Femara for around another 2 years, so I live for the day when I no longer have to take this medication (although it's probably keeping the cancer at bay).  I do work full time (37.5 hrs) so although I am in a lot of pain, it hasn't stopped me from working.  Some days I don't want to get out of bed but I am a strong person and won't let it ruin my life. I hope your symptoms are bearable and I wish you all the very best.  Be strong, take painkillers, and hang in there. Best Wishes Denise xx",
