Everyone's different when it comes to pain relief etc. so if your painkillers aren't working, get someone to ring your GP or BCN and ask for something different to what you have. I was constantly told that it's unnecessary to be in pain and it won't help your recovery.  Sending you warmest wishes xx",

      "Content": "Hi Hawkster,    so sorry you find yourself here, but this is a great place to vent, ask questions, get advice and feel completely supported by those who have been where you currently are.    I was diagnosed last October aged 47, 2 kids aged 19 & 16 and a husband who has the patience of a saint. Having lost my mam very quickly to ovarian cancer I assumed I wouldn't be here to see the summer but here I am! I've had a mastectomy, some lymph nodes out, I'm part way through reconstruction with more surgery in Sept. and hysterectomy early next year. I found being open and honest with my kids has helped them to cope as they know I'm not keeping secrets, we all have good & bad days but I'm still here, back at work and off on hols this week so what I'm trying to say is you will find a way of coping in the best way you can, just do what feels right for you and your family. I felt calmer once I had my treatment plan and I hope that once you have yours you will feel the same.  Sending you & your family good wishes xx  ",

I didn't ask any questions when I was having biopsies as I thought it might just be a routine thing to do. As for the 'oh bugger' comment it could have been an ill timed remark and she could have said it for an entirely different reason to what you're thinking, but I can understand why you are assuming the worst.  Stay busy, stay away from Google and focus only on what is known, everything else will only cause you anxiety.

However due to family history of ovarian/stomach/bowel and my breast cancer I was referred to genetics. Fast forward to now, BRCA1 & 2 negative but still considered high risk for ovarian cancer so although I'm just under the genetic threshold for genetic recommending ovaries & Fallopian tubes removed they referred me back to gynecologist who strongly recommend total hysterectomy for me. I've given this a lot of thought and as I'm in my 40's decided to go ahead with it.  I did ask for regular CA125's as an alternative to hysterectomy but was told that would be classed as screening and so they can't do this as NHS currently don't have a screening programme for ovarian cancer. CA125 is only an indicator not a reliable diagnostic tool. I was told CA125 could be raised due to pelvic infection/endometriosis etc. Not sure if that helps at all, feel free to ask anything x",

I have been told that I have to return to see the consultant this Thursday when he will discuss my treatment plan with me. I telephone the breast Nurse to ask for clarification and she advised me that my treatment will be an operation and chemo (not neccessarily in that order), and maybe other treatments depending on the biopsy results. She told me that the radiographer marked my report as lump (score 5) and calcification (4). I'm now scared stupid that this means it's stage 5/4. I'm worried about so many things at the moment mostly the unknown, I just want Thursday to be here so I know exactly what I'm dealing with and what lies ahead. I have told my immediate family the situation but no one beyond them. I think I'm hoping the doctor will say it's all been a massive mistake and there's nothing wrong with me...Roll on Thursday 4pm! Any advice on what to ask the doctor will be very helpful. Lola xx",

I had my pre op this week for more breast surgery end of Dec and I was told if I had any questions regarding the surgery I should call my BCN. I commented that I understood the procedure but wondered why I've never been asked if I needed to talk through the emotional and psychological impact of it all to which the nurse said but that's what your BCN is there for...is that true? My BCN has never asked if I need or want to talk about any of it, I have only spoken to her if I have a specific question and then I get a specific rushed answer. I've only called 3 times in 14 months and have always felt like she has more important things to attend to. If emotional support is part of a BCN role why wasn't I told this at the start - I feel a bit let down as there have been times I could've done with someone away from my family and friends to talk to. I was lucky enough not to need chemo but I also haven't had the benefit of meeting or talking to other ladies. Have I misunderstood the role of a BCN and done myself out of support or is it assumed if you don't ask for support you don't need it?",

      "Content": "Hi, just looking for your thoughts. I had a mastectomy, 4 lymph nodes removed and reconstruction using muscle from my back just over a year ago. straight after the op my arm on the affected side was very painful and my hand was a bit swollen, this went away within a week or so and up until recently I've just had pain in my back on and off. The problem I have is since my op to exchange the expander implant my breast increases then decreases in size and over the past 2 weeks I've had pain and tightness in the same arm and back near my shoulder blade that has gradually got worse to the point that my GP has put me on Naproxen, dihydracodeine, paracetamol and a sleeping tablet as it is so bad I can't get more than an hours sleep due to the pain and discomfort. Yesterday my hand was very slightly swollen but has gone overnight, however, my back feels a bit odd near my shoulder blade. My GP thinks it's a frozen shoulder but I have full movement of it so I'm not sure about that. The tablets aren't relieving it at all, the only thing that helps is putting pressure on my arm by lying on it when I'm in bed. I think this is something to do with the op I had even though it was some time ago and I just wondered if anyone has experienced anything similar or can offer any advice As to what may be the problem (I haven't done anything different or lifted anything heavy to cause a strain). Any thoughts are welcome xx",

I was like you, brave face, keeping strong for everyone else but had a couple of meltdowns at home. I ended up resenting people telling me how well I was coping etc. but then I realised this was the impression I gave them. I had a 6 week wait for surgery from diagnosis, not long but felt like forever. Try to keep busy and use the time to get everything ready for when you come home. I had my skin sparing Mx SLNB & LD flap reconstruction last Dec and at times still can't believe I turned up for it as but I'm glad I did, the cancer is gone and whilst not the breast I started out with I have an excellent result from the recon. I don't know if you're having reconstruction too? The surgeon showed me pics of his work and I couldn't get over how good they looked. Make use of your BCN as well, they are there to support you too.
