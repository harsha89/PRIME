      "Content": "Hi last week I was elated last chemo yippeee!! Now with side effects a plenty and infected eyelids I feel terrible.. Even cried myself to sleep last night. My chemo was only precautionary had low grade dcis reoccurrence, got 15 rads and had all scans so no real reason it should have gone anywhere, so why am I so scared ?? My OH just went to work with a cheer up remark, just don't know what to do I'm sure these feelings will pass.. God awful thing it not only batters you physically but mentally as well, any reassurances would be much appreciated at this present time ðŸ˜£ xx",
