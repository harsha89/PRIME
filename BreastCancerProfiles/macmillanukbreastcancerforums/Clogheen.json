      "Content": "Hi Lucy, I could have written that  post ! I have three more treatments left and I'm already worrying about where else the cancer is going to turn up ! I was fortunate in so far as I only had a lumpectomy with clear margins but I feel  the problem here is dealing with the psychology of being diagnosed I truely feel we have been changed forever and cancer will alway's be at the back of our minds! My focus now is taking on board all the advice that was given to me, improving my immune system by avoiding dairy, red meat and as far as possible only eating organic,,,,,,,,,not forgetting exercise, I also avoid sugar and alcohol ! I start the day with a freshly squeesed  lemon in warm water to kick start my body, that makes me feel in charge from the moment I get up,,,,,,,,,,may sound silly to a lot of people but it works for me, It is my way of being in control and doing my bit to ensure cancer will have a lesser chance of getting  a grip on me again,,,,,, I feel totally exhausted come the afternoon so any form of exercise must take place in the morning's and that can be mopping floors, cleaning window's,,,,,,,,,it does not matter as long as I am moving ! I wish you well in overcoming all the fears, God knows it's not an easy road for any of us and at such a young age as yourself it must be so much harder........ I'm sure you will have a very long life ahead of you, there are so many survivers out there living full lives so just focus on being one of them :-) Thanks to the poster's that recommended the book I will get it on  my Kindle today ! A long and healthy life is wished for all of us !",

Also it must lower our immune system so just makes sense to me to either stay away from it or only drink in moderation, Building up the immune system is key as it put's us in control,,,,,,,,,,,I am very aware there are many very clean living people out there who have lost their lives to cancer so at the end of the day think we still have some way to go but with cancer increasing year on year what we are eating and drinking must be playing a huge part, I do avoid dairy, red meat and sugar's and stick to organic as much as possible, however I very recently started eating Free Range Chicken as I could not justify the cost of organic,  Had I lassoed a sparrow in the garden and roasted it there would have been more meat on it ! Good health and a long and happy life to us all :-)",
