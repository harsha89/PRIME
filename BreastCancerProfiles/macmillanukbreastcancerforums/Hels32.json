    "Content": "Hi Jen86, I was diagnosed just before Christmas (at 32) and my first question was - can I have them both off. I wanted to not have to worry about the other one in the future and I wanted the best cosmetic outcome too as I hopefully have a long time left with them! My older sister had bc at 29 and had a mastectomy. They are now so different and she is very self conscious. But she can't bring herself to go through any more surgery so she's left it and ignores it.  Because of my family history (my mum also had bc) the genetics team at Guys hospital calculated that I had a over 30% chance of reoccurrence in the other breast and approved the bilateral mastectomy.  I had immediate reconstruction and I'm just having chemo now and then radiotherapy. Then next year when it's over I'll go back to surgery.  Good luck and remember that what's most important is that you are with your kids as long as possible. My boy is completely my reason to get up in the morning! Lots of love, H xx",
