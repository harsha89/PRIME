    "Content": "Hi I also didn't bother with the cold cap and have my second chemo on Wednesday - my head has also been about sensitive when lying on a pillow and the last couple of days my hair has been coming out all over the place! I'm moulting worse than the dog! I've worn a hat the last couple of days so as not to drop hair everywhere so have decided to go and have it cut very short - probably shaved so I can at least wear my wig! At the moment I wouldn't go out with my hair looking like it is without a hat so I may as well get rid! At least I can then wear hats or a wig. Based on what you say it does sound like the cold cap is working compared to what I'm experiencing at the moment. Hopefully it won't get any worse for you.Â  Take care, Ali x",
