      "Content": "Hi i finished my treatment a month ago . having it done is fine ..only abit uncomfortable having your arms back for 10 minutes....but you get use to it. I found i was getting tired easy in my third week which went on for around 3 weeks. Im still on reduced hours as i work full time which has really helped. Im wondering thou if anyone else who has had it done felt really low and fed up after 4 weeks pf the treatment ending. good luck with it your be fine. Xx",
