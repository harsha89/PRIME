Thanks for the link also.  Feel more positive, I think just getting thoughts out of my head is very therapeutic and although I\u2019m not alone, actually hearing from someone having experienced the same thoughts, problems issues is very comforting. ",

      "Content": "Hi all.  Just to let you know, after such a traumatic beginning I had some great news yesterday.  My result from my bone scan showed no evidence of anything sinister.  I had convinced myself that it had spread to my bones and was petrified.  It has given me a real lift, and although have my \u2018big\u2019 meeting tomorrow with oncologist, it has just given me the hope and extra courage to face the future with a more positive view.  I know there could still be massive hurdles but I\u2019m taking each positive at a time.  ",

      "Content": "Hi all.  I\u2019ve just joined after being diagnosed with breast cancer on 1st May.  I\u2019m in the middle of the all the scans, tests etc.  I\u2019m just feeling so scared and a bit lost.  I\u2019m struggling to copeith this in between stage and my mind keeps racing from it will be ok to I\u2019ve got 5 months to live.  I have my oncologist appointment on 16th, which ironically is my Birthday  I know whatever the results at least I will have a plan of Attack, but I\u2019m really struggling with this part.  I do have extremely supportive friends which is good as I\u2019ve not told family yet.  I have to small boys and the thought of telling them is breaking my heart.  ",

      "Content": "Hi thanks for your reply.  I do have a wonderful support network of friends but it\u2019s good to speak with someone that knows exactly how I\u2019m feeling and having experienced the same. I don\u2019t know what kind of cancer I have yet, although I was given a diagnosis form with G3 ductal er pr -ve h82 +ve, written on it.  I have no idea what all these phrases mean, which adds to my overall anxiety.  I do know that I will be having chemotherapy as I have quite a large tumour in my right breast, approx 5cm, and believe cancer was showing in my lymph nodes, but again not sure what that means. Im guessing that on Thursday I will find out all the information on type, spread, chemo plan etc.  I know I will feel better after that but the waiting is absolute torture and every little ach, pain, bruise, is in my mind is the cancer rampaging through my body.  I know this is not the case but difficult to stop these thoughts.  The first few days after being told I really could not function and once the boys were at school I just sat on the settee and cried.  My friend gently pushed me to the Drs and I was perceived diazipam which I must say, have been a life saver.  I really thought I was losing my mind and having a mental breakdown, but I\u2019m now able to manage feelings and emotions better taking a bit more control.   I am worried about telling my boys aged 7&11.  Some say not to say cancer other say be honest.  I don\u2019t want to lie and want to be as open as possible, it\u2019s not like I can hide this. We have all been through a really tough time already as in September last year I was diagnosed with a brain tumour.  I had surgery in October to remove it (not cancer and not related) so we have already been through the mill, and I kinda thought that we had been dealt the big one for my family, but how wrong.  I just want Thursday to be over so I can really get into treatment and recovery with a set plan.    Any tips on dealing with Chemo?  maybe I can get prepared beforehand, at least I feel like I\u2019m doing something proactive.",
