      "Content": "Hello Dolina, not exactly the the same as you but  I had a tumour found in breast but an ultrasound, MRI and CT showed no abnormalities  in the lymph nodes.  until they did a lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy then 1 node was found to have a large deposit so I had lymph node clearance too. now waiting for radiotherapy but that is to zap the breast where the initial tumour was. I asked about the armpit and they said no cancer would be there as all lymph nodes taken. sorry probably not much help! jac x",

      "Content": "Hi Foxglove65  sorry to hear your diagnosis. I had lumpectomy but was never given these options so hopefully someone will come along to help more specifically. I just had a choice of where the scar would be. So opted for round the areola rather than across my boob. Pleased I did as you can hardly see that scar now. I do have a scar where they did the SNB and that is visible but getting better day by day.  I was told that they could do lipofilling if the size/shape was an issue in the future which I think involves fat transfer. I\u2019m not at that stage yet as still have swelling . good luck and I hope someone is able to help",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, it is another minefield. I wasn't eligible on the NHS for the omcotype DX as I had cancer in my lymph nodes, only 1 out of 19 but under NICE guidelines I'm ineligible. obviously I was comcerned that going down the rads route only would not give me complete belt and braces approach. However there are other reasons in play as to why they would suggest chemo or not and whether they would do oncoytpe DX to see. my tumour was very slow growing and non aggressive based on size, Ki 67 score HER 2 - and hormone positive status. at 44 it was thought that the risks of chemo would outweigh the benefit. it is a question to put to your team, as I did when I found out about it, and they can clear up any confusion or concerns. best wishes",

Just wondering now if it was th chemo things may improve for you. on the Aveeno front which one ar you using? I found the one with green cap and writing not as good as the \"skin relief\" one which has blue cap and writing on it. Still using it now twice a day! I tried the aloe gel and kept in fridge and although was very good at soothing the hot skin I didon't find it very good at moisturising so maybe watch that. hope you go well with GP though and getting the R1 R2 creams.",

I had 3 boosters and asked why and was told because the tumour site was deep in my breast so wanted extra localised zaps to ensure reached. I'm a C cup so not huge and my tumour was 19mm.

They said I had to not move my hands though to cover mouth if I wanted to cough and to just cough into the air! It may be an idea to give them a call today to see if you can delay start as it is hard lying on your back for a cough. Equally I really don't think they'd mind if you went tomorrow and discussed it with them first and made a decision whether to go ahead or not. In the meantime, lemon and honey?

I had it drained 3 times and each time a very red liquid came out. I was concerned as I thought it was supposed to be straw coloured but they reassured me that it was old blood mixed in and needed to come out. I then went for radiotherapy and alien seroma caused a few issues as it changed th shape of my contours so between planning and the first zap the change was too big so they had to rescan and mark up again for rads. I was told not to get drained through rads and all went ahead with additional CTs during to double check. Now here was where I seem to have been lucky and the rads helped shrink the seroma. All I can feel now ( and I\u2019m now 3 months Post end of rads) is a very small hard lump under my Axillary scar. Hope you manage to find relief from your seromas soon",

This is either -ve or +ve and again will dertermine treatment you receive, ie Herceptin treatment if +ve Don\u2019t want to bombard you but one other thing you may want to find out about is your Ki67 score.

I was Grade 2 19mm and had lumpectomy and cancer found in 1 of 3 nodes taken out, I was strongly advised to have Axillary clearance and had to level 2 after some negotiation as they were going to take to level 3.  A further 16 nodes were taken and were all clear, phew! the onco type is not offered on the NHS if nodes are positive, but based on my results of ER +, HER- and a low Ki 67 score I dodged the chemo train and went straight to rads. axilary clearance op I found handed to recover from compar d to thbe lumpectomy and you do have an added risk of lymphedema, but you also do if you have rads to the Axillary area. So far so good in the lymphedema stakes and if I had to do it again I wouldn't change the treatment plan I had. i am in the position though who I can also have tamoxifen with it being hormone positive. hopefully some others will also come along with their advice too to give you as much of a pictur as possible for you to make an informed decision.

      "Content": "Oh good news you got to see your surgeon. As I said before I had this decision to make in Dec last year. My surgeon said there was no difference on risks of lymphedema whether I had surgery or radiotherapy to the area. But he did say things were looking more favourable for not going ahead with ANC but as results not all in he didn't want to risk it so after further discussions we decided just on removing levels 1 and 2 lymph nodes. This means that level 3 still there and can hopefully mop up any cancer that may ( hopefully not) appear in the future. so I'm coming to 6 months down and no lymphedema to date. I am careful with not lifting heavy things and I moisturise daily and carry germolene and insect bite cream around with me. All other activities are back to normal. at the end of the day it is such a personal decision to make. I was happy I went ahead as I was pretty paranoid more lymph nodes could have cancer in them and I wanted it all out!! did your surgeon give any preference as to what you should do....perhaps a \"if this was your wife or daughter what would you advise\"?? sending lots of good wishes and hugs your way",

      "Content": "Hello again All your questions were exactly what I went through before deciding too. I stayed in overnight after op but only due to anaesthetic issues ( I also stayed in after lumpectomy). I had a drain for a week and this was still Draining when removed but I had quite a sore side and shoulder and thought the drain was contributing so asked for it tot be removed and they were fine with that. The pain immediately subsided so was right decisions I did need codeine after op And for a couple of days but stopped when got too constipated! Managed then on paracetamol and ibuprofen. Exercises really important and were fine to do after about day 2. I did develop a seroma about tennis ball size at its biggest, had drained 3 times before radiotherapy. During rads they had to do extra CT scans to check size but was all fine. It has subsided since with no further treatment but did take about 3-4 months. Was never painful just uncomfortable. I have since been to a lyohedema specialist privately who assessed arm And did baseline measurements. All are good and she thinks I only have a slim chance of developing lymphedema. She prescribed a sleeve and I wear it whenever out walking or doing sport, tennis, yoga and hockey. But I DO NOT have lymphedema. Regards the trial I was told that although there is a trial ongoing to see if further node removal is warranted the results aren\u2019t in yet so the standard is still to remove under NICE guidelines. ( this was DEC 2017 so may be further info out how) In my mind I wanted any nasties left gone so mentally was the right decision for me. I am now 5 months since op And 2 months end of rads. I have full arm movement, but can feel the stretch but in a good way. My boob is still Swollen from rads but only the intermittent  pains expected with nerves etc still mending.  Seroma likes to make an appearance after exercise but not sore so I ignore it!! It is all doable but if I can answer any other questions please let me know Bets wishes",

I don't remember exactly where I found the info about the ability to limit the modal clearance to just levels 1 and 2 but I also have a friend who has gone through similar treatment and she has been an invaluable support. My reasons to push for it was 2 fold at the time. - limit the risk of lymphedema as much as possible and also if another tumour was found in breast down the line ( hell I hope not!) potentially leaving some nodes in place would mop up any cancer cells before they got round rest of body. I then contacted my breast nurse who contacted the surgeon on my behalf and asked. He was happy to leave level 3 and treat conservatively. He also said there was argument to just take level 1 but as the tumor in the node was sizeable at 3mm he would take levels 1 and 2. I'm now heading down the chemo route before radiotherapy which has been a shock. First appointment with oncologist to discuss regimen next week......may I ask what chemo you had? Anything I should ask? Putting a list together!! Good luck with your decision. This cancer crap is a mindfield!! Take care Jac x",

Thankfully all others came back clear. I had 17 removed in total. Recovery has been slower than after the WLE. But I'm 3 weeks post op today and have full range of movement in my arm, albeit a bit stiff ( but not painful). Numbness still very apparent but it's a weird felling rather than anything else. And it is slowly coming back. I do have an issue with my scapula which I'm seeing a Physio about today. The nerve was damaged but not severed that holds th muscle to the scapula so I'm just seeking further advice on how to help this recover. It has already improved. Risk of lymphedema still scares me but I'm coming to terms with it and doing every I can to prevent it occurring. I have learnt a lot about cancer and myself and how I feel about things over the last few months. It's definitely a personal path. I am 44 and my logic is that I don't want this cancer coming back. If I don't throw everything they suggest at it now and it comes back in 5 years I will be devastated. Best wishes all Jac x",

I have never regretted the decisions made, for me and by me, so far, hope that continues.  I am at just over 3 weeks post Axillary clearance at the moment and there is still plenty of numbness under arm and down back of top arm. To be honest it really doesn't bother me. Im at the itching stage where the nerves are doing their best at recovering and can only assume this is good regarding the numbness as it is still improving. There is a chance there will be long term numbness but for me I am not worried as it doesn't seem to affect me with respect to what I can do with my arm. I developed a seroma a few days after the drains came out but a week later and that has resolved on its own, phew! The Physio really helped this week and I've a whole range of new exercises to do now to get the scapula and muscles back to normal. He was very positive and doesn't think I'll  have lasting problem. I'm a tennis player so need my playing arm back to normal so I can play again.....this is my focus at the moment as I'm determined to get back out there in the next week or so. It is helping me have a goal at the moment as chemo is looming! Good luck and best wishes Jac x",

      "Content": "Hi Joanne, I think I'm a week ahead of you. had WLE and SNB on 22nd Nov and then auxiliary clearance 2 days ago. This second op has certainly been more constricting  in the arm movement and only today have I been able to attempt th exercises. After last op I recovered really quickly and was playing tennis again with the affected arm after 3 weeks. You may want to check what level clearance they are going to do. I had one node with a 3mm tumour found out of 3 removed. I had a CT to check staging and thankfully was found to be all clear. I posed the question whether levels 1-3 all needed to be removed and the surgeon said he was happy to be more conservative so took just levels 1 and 2. This reduces risk of lymphedema slightly and also leaves nodes in as if further lumps found in the future leaving nodes may help prevent  further spread. Onviously we are all different and decisions need to be done individually but hope this helps. A V shaped cushion is fab...they gave me one on the ward, apparently lovely volunteers make them. Also my mum made me a drain Dollie bag. So I can walk around with the drain and have hands free. I am keeping on top of things with pain meds still so don't have experience yet of level of pain without them!! Fingers crossed it doesn't all kick in on Xmas Day !!

I don't have lymphedema but do still have a large seroma under my Axilla scar so wanted to see if she could help with that. She has done arm measurements on both arms and there is a couple of larger measurements on my bad side but not enough to warrant a lymphedema diagnosis. It's all about percentages and mine is low. the long and short is no she can't help the seroma as it is a pocket of lymph and does not respomd to lymphatic massage, but she will see me again after my radiotherapy has finished to help with scar tissue reduction to see if that will release the seroma. what she has done is suggest I wear a compression sleeve when I go out walking or shopping or for any length of time my arm is just hanging down. She's written a letter to give to my GP to get one on prescription. so my question is does anyone else wear one or have been advised to wear one as a preventative measure?  Many thanks for reading and any advise",

Not sure whether this is due to a face plant I had couple of days ago. So just going to monitor. I'm sorry you're suffering so much, how are you coping?

Spoke with GP before I left and he said that the risk is only increased whilst on Tamoxifen if you are already predisposed to blood clots in the first place. He said taking 75mg aspirin day before, day of flight and day after would not hurt but was up to me. so I deceid3d to take the aspirin and I wore flight socks and my lymphedema sleeve. 4hours in and my hand starts to feel odd and cold so I started clenching and unclenching it. I had been drinking lots of water and going to the toilet or for a stretch every hour. The hand had swollen completely so I took the sleeve off. Was in a slight panic and on my own so no one to chat to. Thankfully within about half hour of being offf plane hand returned to normal. flight home I left the sleeve off.....will discuss next time I see specialist!! On taking socks off feet were pudgy but settled down quickly......maybe I\u2019m just predisposed to swelling up!!!! happy flying everyone.

I had levels 1 and 2 removed and a total of 19nodes, only the 1 was found to have cancer in from the SNB. i have now developed lymphedema of my breast as a result of the radiotherapy. I\u2019ve had private MLD and do it myself now daily and some days it sms better than others. I go back to NHS  onc in sept and hoping they will refer me to their lymphedema specialist then good luck with your decision, do ask every thing you think of to your team so you can get your answers and make the right decision for you  take cae",

      "Content": "Hi there, have you had follow up with your surgeon or is this first appointment after surgery? After my lumpectomy and SNB cancer was found in my lymph nodes so I had to have further surgery but if you already know your results th next steps should be what your next treatment will be. ( chemo/rads/hormone therapy or nothing). My surgeon initially confirmed all results as to size, Grade, etc. I was also told chemo was next step.....although this wasn't correct. at first oncologist appointment she went through again all the results and said chemo would not be required. She showed me the NHS predict score which was less than 5% benefit so not worth the risks of chemo. So the plan was then made for next steps which in my case was radiotherapy and tamoxifen fro 10years! she also assessed my readiness for radiotherapy based on recovery from surgery and booked me in with the radiotherapy team and gave me my first prescription for Tamoxifen. hope that makes sense, do keep asking questions as I always find the best way to be in control is to learn as much as possible good luck and take care",

Thankfully lumpectomy was done! additionally I was unfortunate to have lymph node incolovement after the SNB and so then has a CT to check whole body. However I also know that this is not always standard And not all  people have them then either. it really is very dependent on your own specific results s to next steps.

      "Content": "Hello there, i had this second operation exactly a month after the WLE and SNB. And  was 3 days before Christmas last year! It is doable but I would say took me longer to recover from. I had a drain in for about 5 days and once that was out I felt loads better. The exercises are an absolute must and days I didn\u2019t do them I noticed my arm feeling more stiff. there are more risks associated with ANC but I was happy to move forward knowing that any critters would be well and truly gone at the end. I have spoken since to another surgeon who said things are changing and a full clearance is not always warranted but it\u2019s all decided on an individual bases so if you are not sure go back and ask more questions, ask what would be an alternative or % risk of not doing anything.  My results came back all clear after having a further 17 nodes taken out, but I still don\u2019t regret my decision. I did develop a large seroma which was more annoying than painful and is pretty much resolved. A recent ultrasound shows there\u2019s a pocket of fluid still but I don\u2019t notice it at all.  The lymphedma risks are now higher however my arm is so far so good. Unfortunately I have developed oedema in my breast but this is attributable to radiotherapy rather than the op. Again it is annoying but not painful and not stopping me from doing anything anymore! finally during the op one of the nerves that attached muscle to my scapula was damaged so I did have a \u201cwinged scapula\u201d  but other than being sore to raise arm up above head no lasting damage as Physio sorted that quite quickly. i am now 7months down the line from the op and 4months post end of treatment I would say I\u2019m 90%back to me and still going in right direction. all this BC stuff is a steep learning curve and what I know now to 8months ago is phenomenal. Do not beat yourself up about any decision but have to be comfortable moving forward with the decisions you make for YOU and you only. hope this helps a little, take care",

Just had my seroma drained again this morning and crossing fingers it doesn't come back again but have another appointment booked for next week too. i spoke to the nurse for a long time about how much exercise to do and she says it is a fine balance at wanting to get better and more active to letting the arm rest and healing to happen. the consultant last week said to do no exercise......but this is bad for my mental health. apparently walking and swinging your arms is good. Also gentle massaging your arm from hand upwards. good luck jac x",

      "Content": "Hi Pixie, i felt in a similar situation to you this time last year. Not the same cancer type, mine was ductal and in a node. My % benefit to having chemo was also just 3% and my oncologist would not advise chemo unless the benefit was 5% or higher as she felt the risks of chemo outweighed the benefits.. I though as was found in my nodes it was automatic chemo but I had full ANC and all other nodes were negative. i struggled as just wanted to throw everything at it, relatively young at 45, I thought I would cope better than if it returned when I was older.  I took all my concerns back to BCN a couple of days later and she was very helpful going through all my specific tumour parameters and she allayed my fears so I was more comfortable in my head about moving on without the chemo. So far no regrets and a year on I had the all clear before Christmas. A suggestion would be to  approach your team with your concerns/questions until you have all answered satisfactorily to be able to move on.  Bestwishes to you",

I think there  is a tendency to think the worst, I know I did. Almost stopiped and waited for that first hot flush but so far so good. Other ladies are not so lucky I do realise but until you start taking them it's all guess work. some people find different brands ar more tolerable than others. I was given TEVA brand as my first prescription and have stuck with that so don't know if I'd have any SEs with any of the other brands. try not to worry you may have very minimal side effects let us know how you get on",

Tamoxifen I think is having an impact here on what was actually already present and causing me not a lot of bother.  The onc said if really bad she'd add in zoladex but I'm trying to avoid that as just don't want any other side effects to come into play.....certainly do not want to bring on the hot flushes!! the emotional crap is ever prsent, not all th time but would like a day to go by without the crap coming into my thoughts.

Just need to pace myself! i have become more emotional but not feeling any signs of depression. I've decided I'm going to just take it as it comes and deal with any side effects if they happen. There are different brands of tamoxifen which may be more suitable to one than another. I currently take TEVA brand and going to stick with that for now if fatigue is only issue.  Possibly antihistamines may help the itching?  Hooe you find some relief",

I do think trying to do a walk, some exercise most days has helped with the fatigue, sounds odd but it must get the right endorphins firing or something! hot flushes, none to date and long may that continue!!  I did have stomach  pains this last week and thought ovary kind of area which tied in with ovulation of my cycle. Eased up after a day or so. Going to see what happens next cycle. Could have been anything even just a gastro upset but I think we're so much more aware of any little pain/change of feelings.

I was very unsure what to do here as the risks of lymphedema are higher. I did opt for the complete removal of levels 1and 2 and asked them to leave 3 alone! And no further nodes tested positive for macro or micro mets. Some surgeons don\u2019t advocate node removal as it\u2019s not a nice op. And I think for micromets it is considered overkill. i wa also told and I looked at the stats myself too that chemo risks would outweigh any benefit and after some mental torment I went with the advice or oncologist and had radiotherapy only.  Ive just had my one year mammogram and awaiting the results not very patiently!",

      "Content": "Hi charlene70 I have been taking tamoxifen for just over a month. The side effects so far have been very manageable. For me I have felt just tired in the main. I also was very irrationally emotional last week but have not attributed totally to tamoxifen as was very tired through a bad sleep, had just completed my first week of rads and had my period! Tamoxifen for pre menopausal women can also cause bone thining  as does the AIs but for post menopausal ladies it has the opposite effect. I have looked into this in great detail as my Nan, Mum and aunt all had/have osteoporosis however from what I have read a balanced diet and exercise and possibly taking calcium supplements should help to avoid that side effect.  I hope this has helped it is a mimefiled of information that\u2019s for sure!",

I'm only 4 months in and hoping radiotherapy starts next week to have an actual end date to treatment, but then what!! i did speak to a very good friend who went through this 4 years ago and she did say I can now go days, sometimes even weeks without thinking about it. So I do hope there is light at the end of the tunnel for us all . take care and keep busy! Maybe plan things to look forward to too.",

      "Content": "Hi Sandy, i did not have mastectomy but did develop a seroma after and ANC op. I had it drained 3 times over 3 weeks and then embarked on radiotherapy and was told to leave it be or my measurements would be out. This caused a few issues as I had to keep having a CT through the treatment to check they were still targeting right place! They are frustrating things, I researched and asked for advice and they are really a law onto their own. If you drain them because they are huge and causing pain they are likely to come back. Your body needs to try and reabsorb it. So it\u2019s a balance between trying to leave be and having drained to relieve the discomfort I\u2019m afraid. Gentle massage/stroking may help, the fluid needs to find a new path. good luck and I do hope it\u2019s rsolves for you soon",

My recent supply had 2 boxes of 2 different brands so she swapped then one out and ordered in the TEVA again for me. going to stick with it for now and maybe change if the emotional rubbish kicks in again to see if a different brand would be better. good luck",

      "Content": "Hello, everything crossed for your results tomorrow. I had SNB and then full node clearance where th y went in at same scar. Last op was Dec 2017. I developed a seroma which was hard and went into my armpit and directly under the scar there. I did have it drained a coupl of times but then had radiotherapy and they said to leave it be. I still have it, not so much painful as annoying and a bit uncomfortable. It is VERY slowly going down but I'm now over 3 months post op. They are stubborn things if it is a seroma. i was advised to watch for increased redness and hotness as potentially may be infection, but had none of that thank fully. At lest you can get it checked tomorrow. do let us know how you get on take care",
