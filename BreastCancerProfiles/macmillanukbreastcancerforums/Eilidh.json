    "Content": "Hi, I remember how terrifying it was waiting to go in for my lumpectomy.  People try to understand but unless you've been through the terror of diagnosis, it's hard to understand.  I had my lumpectomy 8 years ago followed by radiotherapy with yearly mammograms.  I know I was lucky but many of us are.  I was diagnosed with womb cancer 2 months ago but I tried to look at it as 8 years cancer free which would not have happened 50 or 60 years ago.  Again I was caught early and after a radical hysterectomy (which was not all that pleasant) I've been told I don't need any more treatment.  I hope all goes well for you tomorrow and I know everyone on this site will be thinking of you.  I found it so helpful to talk to people who had been through it and the ladies on this site are wonderful",
