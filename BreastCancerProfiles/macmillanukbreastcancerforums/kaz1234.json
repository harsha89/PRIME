My breast care nurse recommended this and said no under wiring, alos sports bras are no good as getting them over your head will be a bit difficult. I also got bra extension hooks which help, just make sure you get the correct ones, either 2 or 3 hooks. M & S do wonderful post op bra but its like a hammock but its so comfortable.

They use that muscle and as its only been used to being infront of the ribs the muscle has to be stretched gradually like when pregnant and your insides grow gradually over the 9 months. This muscle goes over the permant implant. Does anyone know how long permanent implants last, i have heard its 10 to 15 years? Take Car Love Kaz x",

Everyone i have spoken to has had node sample even if it is a lumpectomy. Its is best to get this sorted out now because if it has spread it will be very early stages and can be fought better with chemo, etc. I am on tamoxifen which is used for pre and post menopausal, side effect vary with all the drugs from person to person. My advise is take one step at a time. focus on the operation first and then the results will follow about 10days after that. dont worry we will all be here to help you every step of the way.

Still havent cried apart from when i was told that it had spread to lymph nodes.

I have masectomy in feb followed by lymph node removeal. When i have masectomy they encourage me to have reconstruction at same time. As i have no spare tissue, at that time i was small but now they would find spare tissue!!!, They gave me a temporary implant that was inflated every week for 4 weeks with saline. I am about to start RT and they have told me to contact surgeon 4 weeks after i have finished all treatment so they can do permant implants in both. Take Care Love Kaz x",

Just finished all my treatment for breast cancer, had masectomy, chemo RT and reconstruction since Jan 2010 and have been on tamoxifen since Aug 2010. Had two periods just before christmas 2011 and doc sent me for internal ultrasound and they said it was a typical tamoxifen thick uterus lining so not to worry.Â Had check up with oncology 2 weeks ago and they were not happy when i told them and have refered me to gynea on 30th April. Trying to get me head round it and prepare myself mentally as i was convinced that i didnt have breast cancer. My advice definatly go to the doctor and get it checked out, if you are in touch with your oncologist then go directly to them. Good luck and keep in touch. Love Kaz x",
