    "Content": "Hi will be 4 weeks post op on Thursday, havent seen oncologist yet hopefully on Wednesday. Had the drains taken out 5 days post op.   Resulted in Seranoma, went to hospital and had it drained, quite amazed it was a litre of yes it does look like pale ale, went again last week, another litre plus. Bad again on Friday but was told there was noone that could drain it for me, so had a very uncomfortable weekend. Am going to hosp on Wed have decided to manage till then to save another trip. Foe anyone know whether  anyone at the local surgery should be able to do this. I have to say though that it is quite painfull and uncomfortable but more than anything very wearing. Well thats got that off my chest thank you its nice to be able to have a moan. Thoughts are for all of us suffering with this awfull thing but we will get past it and life is still good.",
