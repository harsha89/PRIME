      "Content": "Hi Iam 48 yrs old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 27 Nov. Ive had lumpectomy followed by axillary clearence. I was told I needed Chemotherapy, as Iam stage 2 and it was in the first sentinel lymph node. Had 17 removed intotal. On visiting unit for pre assessement for chemotherapy I was told I would receive epirubin and cyclophosphamide.  I was so scared and confused I forgot to ask a lot of questions. The nurse at the unit was so pre occupied with other things as she kept disappearing. I came home and I have read so much including the past posts but not sure why I am not reciving flouracil (FEC). I feel in the last month I ve been pulled apart and past from pillar to post. Ive no breast care nurse and the first session is Monday. I am feeling lost....... Can anyone help?",
