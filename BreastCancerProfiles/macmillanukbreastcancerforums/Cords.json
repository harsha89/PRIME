      "Content": "Hi volvox I had mastectomy and no recon.  I\u2019m back to my spin and swimming (10 weeks later) and was pretty good after 3weeks.  I was lucky as I healed well with no infections and my arm mobility came back after a couple of weeks as I was so focused on the arm exercises (which I still do).  I\u2019m living with one breast and it\u2019s actua quite easy, I sometimes wish I\u2019d had the other one off as well to balance everything up, although I may consider the diep flap later. I think it all depends on what stage of life you are at and the type of cancer etc.  It\u2019s so difficult to make these decisions whilst you\u2019re in the thick of it!  I just wanted to reassure you that one breast is doable. Hoping for the best for you and a big hug xxx",

I put all my faith in the professionals. Hope this helps.  My scar looks fine and is healing well.  I looked it at straight away as I decided this is my shape going forward. Cords",

I've come to realise that as long as there's a bit of balance, no one notices.  I'm just thankful and happy to be alive and that the cancer has been taken away.",

The op is realively simple and in my case (no reconstruction)  healing has been quick i.e.  I only had my drain in for 2 days whereas it's a fair bit longer if you have recon at same time).  I haven't discounted recon but my main objective was to get rid of the tumours and focus on getting better first.   Mostly I am at ease with it all, although I have noticed it takes others around me much longer to adjust I.e hubby/daughter/colleagues. One friend burst into tears when she came around to visit, which I really wasn't expecting?? I know I will have to work on how I feel as a female as right now I don't see myself as 'sexual' although I would have done pre op.  I've been looking around at mastectomy lingerie to see if this might help. I do wear my knitted knocker everyday from a shape/symmetry perspective.  It's lovely and soft and so doesn't irritate the scar.  It has been an excellent standby whilst I wait for my prosthesis fitting (6 weeks post surgery).   Hope this helps cords",

If you're still worried get back in touch with your Bcn, just the reassurance will help and it's entirely understandable. All the best Cords",
