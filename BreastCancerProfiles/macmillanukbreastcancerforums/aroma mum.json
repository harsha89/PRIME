I didn't have the same reaction as you did my problems were with a blood clot on the lung but i think the worry and fear of the next round will have been similar. But all i can say is that you know what to look for, you are prepared and you know that you are one cycle closer to the end. I packed a case and was mentally prepared should the need be to attend hospital again. I was lucky and it wasn't necessary and the last cycle was a breeze. My thoughts are with you xxx",

The consultant expects it was caused by the cancer and as a result I was given Fragmin which you inject on a daily basis into your stomach. I had surgery booked for March and my surgeon was happy to carry out my surgery as I was using Fragmin on a daily basis. I stopped the injection the day before surgery and then they gave it to me the following day after my surgery. Good luck with your appointment this afternoon and let us know how you get on warm wishes Louise",

I developed in during my first T treatment but at the end of the treatment things do return to normal and you feel like you have new feet. I did have a longer gap between my 3 cycles of T an extra week to recover rather than a reduction in the dosage. My oncology nurses also supplied iced water for my feet and hands whilst I was having the T. I guess this would replicate the cold cap used to prevent hair loss. I did find that this was very useful and did help with the pain. I would also recommend keeping of your feel as much as possible and raising your feet whilst you rest. I know it sounds terribly dull but its amazing what you can accomplish sitting down if you try. I had a stool whilst cooking and sat down to iron. I am sorry it is uncomfortable but I promise things will return to normal. If there is any further please do not hesitate to ask Louise x",

I am afraid I have no experience in the area at all but perhaps if you called the Macmillan help line they could offer you some advise. It sounds as if quick medical intervention is required. Is she registered with a Dr in her home town could you make contact with them and ask them to call on her? or make an appointment on her behalf? Seems like speed might be most important to consider and she may feel too unwell to travel at this time. Good luck and I hope others can offer you some further advise Warm wishes Louise",

This has meant a new series of CT and MRI scans have been taken and I have asked at each results meeting to see the scans  ( which can be shared on their computer screens). I have never had any problem when asking to see these scans after all they are of my body and to ask in detail about their findings which include a report of the findings too. I have also asked for copies which I have taken to the Royal Marsden Hospital for second opinions without any problems too. I would suggest that you phone ahead of your next scheduled appointment and say that you would like to see these records so that they can prepare them ahead of schedule and share them with you. If it helps take someone with you to make notes so that you can re read them when you get home too. I do know that you are protected under the Data Protection Act 1998 and you have personal rights to see anything that is recorded about yourself either on a computer or on paper but hopefully you will not have to mention this. Please feel free to contact me it would be good to speak to someone else with the same diagnosis. Much love Louise x",

I was not given a gown or anything like a towel to cover myself up with. It was painful where she pressed hard on my chest which she never warmed me about or checked I was ok with. She didn't explain what she was doing and before I had even dreamt of asking her the results of the scan she barked at me the results would be sent to my Consultant so not to ask her. She then left the room instructing me I was free to leave once I was dressed. I honestly Left feeling like a piece of meat that had been prodded and poked rather than looked after and cared for.

Today the redness has reduced in the rash but the pain has spread down my arm to above my elbow but as the day has worn on its now trailing down the inside of my arm and into my thumb. The area is not swollen to look at although it does feel heavy. I have been really active doing some house work and gardening but even so this doesn't feel like a sprain or strain. I am wondering if this is Lymphodema and whether its something I should have checked out urgently.? any advise or suggestions would be very welcome please.

      "Content": "Hi Karen, Firstly well done for putting your concerns out there. I think you already know the answer yourself and that you need to check things out as soon as possible and all I can say to you is that you are important and that if you are in pain,it is not right to carry on. You do not say if you had radiotherapy as part of your treatment in June 2013 but it is often the case that the treatment can leave a painful/ discomport in the area but even so it is worth getting it checked out. So that you can put your mind at ease. First port of call is your Dr tomorrow morning, you are important and need to look after yourself as if you are your own best friend. Hope all is ok and please let us know how you get on Much Love Louise x",

Do you still have contact with your BC nurse? I spent some time at the end of my treatment the first time around talking to the Macmillan support team at my hospital and also on the phone. It helped me. I do hope your pain subsides over the coming days is it a stabbing pain or a dull ache?",

My sister has been fantastic but like you say no one can walk in your shoes. I know that others on this site would urge you to have it checked out and it's difficult to pluck up the courage by yourself sometimes. Please look after yourself. My inflammatory cancer of the breast did return and on reflection I was glad that I had gone back because of the smallest patch of redness in my breast. I like you didn't want to make a fuss but I have children who rely on me to be the most well I can be so that I can take good care of them. I truly admire the young men they are becoming and I know that my experience and talking about it openly will perhaps help them in someway in later life. Much love x",

Onc has suggested a new CT scan ( only had one last month) but expect that the capcitabiine and the lapatanib may have stopped working for me and it may suggest I can trial this new drug called TDM1. I just wondered if there was anyone out there trialing this new drug and whether anyone had has the same experience. I suspect skin mets but this hasn't been mentioned yet by my onc. I presume for skin mets they would do a biopsy? If anyone can help with their own experiences I would be very grateful Louise x",

I am not sure if you have already done that yourself. It does set out all of the facts very well and reads about the importance of regular mamo's, self examination and breast exams. I had some time with my nurse at my Drs surgery showing me how to examine myself correctly and feel more confident about doing that now. If I am honest I worry about the return of cancer often but I have now managed to move it from the front passanger seat in my imaginary car and put it in the back seat and hope that one day it will move into the boot!

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, I thought I would add my comments as a mother of two teenage boys and a sufferer of depression myself. My opinion is that talking therapy often helps with depression and in particular cognative behaviour therapy which I was recommended too in the past. I found this personally very helpful and I have always encouraged my boys to speak to others whether its a friend, family member or someone at school (most schools offer counselling today) when things are troubling them. Personally I find that at the age of 13 there are many thoughts and changes happening in the body that feeling out of balance is not uncommon. I do not believe in taking medication as it often covers the symptoms of what your body is trying to tell you and once you stop taking the medication the original feelings can/may return.But that is my personal opinion. Often GP's can see it as a quick answer to a much deeper seated problem. Saying that hopefully your step daughter has a good and sensitive GP and one that will monitor her progress closely. Being a young person today does have different stresses and strains that perhaps we were not exposed to when we were younger. I am sure you offer a good listening ear whilst remaining positive and that will be priceless in the long run All the best Louise xx",

Mention it to your team at the hospital they may have some additional help they can suggest too. Plenty of cream and count down those sessions it will soon be done :) All the best Louise xxx",

I had saline expander on my left breast after Mx in March of last year. I had saline added during my initial surgery and then four weeks later an enormous amount of saline added into my recon in one go!!!. It was a bit of a shock firstly because a) the size and b) the strange weight on my chest. Not to mention the pain!! My surgeon told me the same thing that once I was ready ( 6 months later) we would discuss what we could do to \" even up \" my look. I have to say once I am in a bra or swimming costume you would never know the difference it is only when I am undressed that gravity works its magic on my right sided breast. I could look in the mirror and stand side view on and say I have the breast one side of a 20 year old and when I turn to the other side have the breast of my true 47 years. Its been a mental struggle to get used to it but I have found it doable. Please contact me for any further support or info. My very best wishes Louise x",

I am sure that your team will be looking at you as an individual and making the best judgements for your next FEC and then the Doxetaxel. You will know from reading all the different posts on the site that we all have so many different reactions and side effects to these medications and in some way i find this reassuring as we are all different and whilst some find one treatment difficult others find it not so bad. Try to talk to your team and let them know your worries especially with your weight many Macmillan units have dieticians that you can meet with too. Sounds like that would be helpful for you. I wish you lots of energy and good luck with the rest of your treatment  journey Louise x",

You will have a contract with your company you need to read it and see what their policy is for sick pay. This will be good information to have to hand when you phone the help line tomorrow. Do not worry all changes to your contract have to be put in writing and agreed by yourself.

It does give you a chance to re-focus on whats important to you and your life. But i think you need to be at the right sort of place emotionally to be able to do that. Who can help you at this time, BC nurse?, Dr, I have spoken to the lovely nurses on this website for support at times too. Have you thought of local groups in your area that you could join, your hospital will be able to offer you the names of  support groups available in your area too. You could meet a new friend that way too. Ranting often makes you feel better why not embrace it knowing you will come out the other end feeling stronger and you are already an amazing person  because you wouldn't have got this far without your own inner strength.

      "Content": "Hi Suze0, I haven not had thoracic surgery but do expect that will be part of my forth coming treatment after oral chemotherapy. I was re diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in September almost a year after my first diagnosis in 2012. I am expecting to complete 6 rounds of oral chemotherapy which will take me until the end of January 2014. Hopefully there is someone else who can talk from experience about thorasic surgery and  I will learn something at the same time. All the best Louise",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I was worried about having my 3rd and final taxotere and my herceptin treatment on the same day. In fact I did telephone a couple of days before to be sure that there hasn't been a mistake, I was assured that they often gave the two on the same day or a day apart. I would not say that I felt any worse than I had done previously whether it was the delight that it was the last one that helped me through I don't know. I hope all goes well in your ongoing treatments Louise x",

It's really miserable and I think the antibiotics make you feel quite down. Keep up a great diet plenty of water and be kind to yourself with plenty of rest and sleep xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Patricia, you sound perfectly normal who wouldn't be scared, emotional and finding it hard to cope after that  diagnosis. Take a deep breath. I am sorry you find yourself here but you will get plenty of support and advise. Many of us ladies and gents have found ourselves with this diagnosis, but today breast cancer is very treatable and you will find hidden strength you didn't know you had to get you through this time. Try to keep yourself busy until Friday plan some enjoyable things to do. My recommendation  would be to take your partner or a good friend with you on Friday who can take some notes for you during your consultation. I found that very helpful to re read later when I got home. Wishing you lots of kindness Louise",

But listen to your body rest when you need to and if cooking or cleaning are too much for you ensure you have a few speedy meals on standby.Also accept any help offered around the house shopping etc. Be your own best friend and I wish you lots of luck xxx",
