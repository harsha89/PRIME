    "Content": "Hi All, Just had the bad news that after 3 cycles of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin , It's stopped working. An enlarged lymph node in my neck seems to be the sign . Thats now 4 different chemos over the years. FEC ,Taxotare, Capceitabine being the others. I've got to go back and see Professor Davidson my Oncologist tomorrow to see what options are left. Was wondering what other treatment people on here with triple neg have had and if it worked . I'm hanging in there and still not asking the T question. ... but I do wonder ????",
