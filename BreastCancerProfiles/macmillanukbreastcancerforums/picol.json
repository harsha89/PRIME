    "Content": "Hi Tinker I\u2019m half way through 3 x FEC then 3 x Docetaxel so not quite the same but sounds similar. Having had 3 FEC now I\u2019m very nervous about the change of drug next time round and remember being scared of the first treatment. Totally understandable there are so many unknowns.  Overall I\u2019ve found it not as bad as I\u2019d imagined. I took anything they offered and after bad vomiting on first round have an additional anti sickness which helped a lot. I also have sleeping tablets to counteract the steroids which were robbing me of sleep.  I am doing the cold cap and I have kept quite a bit of hair. Worth a try. It\u2019s uncomfortable that\u2019s for sure but I\u2019m going with it for now.  Best of luck Xxxx",
