      "Content": "Roughly a week ago I noticed a white speck or dot on my nipple right on the end, there is only one and it looks like a white head that you get on skin elsewhere really. I'm so scared this could be some kind of cancer of the milk duct or Paget's disease or some kind of calcification which I've read could be cancer. If you google white speck on nipple it comes up with blocked milk duct and all sites that come up are ones to do with pregnancy but I have never had children and I'm def not pregnant now. Its not the natural bumps you gets round the nipple either, the white speck isn't even particularly raised. So scared, my boyfriend was diagnosed with testicular cancer about a month ago and we thought his symptoms would be nothing, I think this has me panicing than ever that mine will turn out to be something sinister, plus I'm still being bullied at work and suffering panic attacks about that, I just dont think I can cope worrying that I have breast cancer too in top of my boyfriend and work :-( Sorry for posting when I'm currently just at the worrying stage I can remove if inappropriate",

      "Content": "Well it's still there so went to GP last week. Got referred to breast clinic for under 35s. The GP thought I might have to have an ultrasound or mammogram as he said that there was no way of telling if it was just something like a milk duct without a looking inside somehow. Saw a consultant at the clinic today however and he barely looked at me. He asked what the problem was had a very quick glance and ran his finger over the spot and said oh that's nothing you can get dressed now. I asked what it was and he said probs just a duct, but he didn't explain how this cold be not ever having been pregnant. I asked him if he was going to do anything else but he just said no you can go with a big smile on his face as though he was amused Id come. I don't know how to take this, I'm happy he said he thought it was nothing but confused how, he could know that! My GP had said there was no way if knowing what would be making a duct protrude without some form of scan, how do I know there isnt a cancer deep inside pushing the duct up, just still confused how it could just be a duct at the surface with no cause.  Dont know what I can do from here, apart from just accept it's nothing on the word of that cursory examination. I think I'm almost more concerned now as don't think they have took me at all seriously at the hospital.  ",

      "Content": "I went to the docs this morning about this white spot, my doc said she had didn't know what it was and hadn't seen something like this before. She couldn't feel any lumps anywhere else at least. She agreed if I had been pregnant or had children she would think just a blocked duct but she hasn't personally had a blocked duct in someone without children before. She did say though that breasts can change due to hormones and that she wanted to wait another 4 weeks to see if it goes away as I am under 35. If it doesn't she said that I should go back and she will refer me to the breast cancer clinic for women under 35 to do tests. Im guessing she might mean for a mammogram. She said that it's normal for them to ask women under 35 to wait this long to see if an abnormality goes away if they have no family history as breast cancer isn't considered common in women under that age and due to breasts changing in young women due to fluctuating hormones. She pretty much floored me really, I was completely expecting her to say its a blocked pore or something like that, not to actually take me seriously. My doctor is very direct and straight forward and hasnt tended to be the type to refer me for tests in the past without a battle, and I wast trying to play it down today virtually trying to put words into her mouth saying its probs noting right. She has me fairly shocked and worried that she is suggesting a referral if it doesn't disappear soon. I know it's probs because she can't say what it is so needs to refer me on to find this out, but I think I expected all possibilities of breast cancer to be pretty much dismissed as a virtual impossibility and to get glared at for suggesting it could be anything. And to top it all the fact I took a half hour off to go to docs did not go down terribly well and my delightful line manager has been worse than ever today piling on pressure and finding fault :-( I'm thinking we'd have to be quite unlucky for my boyfriend and myself to have cancer at same time, both starting off with less than likely symptoms.... I think it might be a long four weeks...",
