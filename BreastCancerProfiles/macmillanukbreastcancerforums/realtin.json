      "Content": " Hi dreamthief , thank you for your help and advice so far. I am asking for advice from anyone  re preparing the veins for bloods et cetera. I went in for my fourth chemo of six yesterday but it couldn\u2019t proceed as the haemoglobin came back to low. I had a blood transfusion  yesterday after difficulty finding a vein and it took 12 needles today to find a vein for today\u2019s transfusion . I could\u2019ve stopped halfway through trying to find it but I wanted to keep going if It meant getting the infusion in today as now I will need to get a pic line fitted early next week in order to go forward. In the meantime I do have to get one more lot of bloods done this Friday and it was so hard today to find a vein, the one we got was on final attempt, just wondering if anyone has tips other than warming up the area running hot water on it et cetera I\u2019d be grateful just for that one more lot of bloods that\u2019s needed to make things a little easier. Thanks a million all going well chemo number four will be next Tuesday. Wishing everybody well hope you\u2019re all okay. Realtin. ",

      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose,  I\u2019m on herceptin , docetaxel and carboplatin. Nausea was a big issue after 1st and the emend definitely helped more on 2nd , especially with heightened sense of smell etc , one before infusion on the day , and one per day at lower dose for next two days, now combined with a canula administered anti nausea, \u2018eloksie\u2019 , I don\u2019t think that I\u2019d correctly spelled if anyone else familiar they might correct me. They helped but also requested tapering on the steroids rather than stopping abruptly on day 3 was a big support. Everyone\u2019s different but you could talk to your team when you know how you react after 1st one. Would definitely be pre empting and taking anti nausea sooner than later. Realtin.",

      "Content": "Hi LizziX, I had drafted a really long reply and have lost the draft so I\u2019m starting again, just to say that I am on the combination of her herceptin, docetaxel and carboplatin . You will know fairly early on as in after your first-round how it will affect you in terms of Nausea. For me it was quite overwhelming but you can adjust your auntie sickness meds to what you need for support. The white cell  injection can leave you feeling pretty flat also and would definitely be taking painkillers around the time that I take mine always now to be prepared. That said after my first one where I had a  bit of hip pain, I was lucky enough in that I now just feel a little more edge on nausea and discomfort flulike management symptoms now.On my second round I started taking emend anti sickness day0, 1&2and found them a big help though even on that second round the nausea was still  quite overwhelming. On the third round I was given an additional called \u2019eloxie\u2019, not sure of the spelling now as it was given through canula and I haven\u2019t seen the packaging. The combination of those two seems to help  and your team will chat to you about what they think will be most helpful for you. Also I requested a tapered steroid support rather than just stopping on day three as I found the compination of the white-cell injection and stopping the steroids the next day  really hit me very hard. Everyone\u2019s reaction is different. When I thought that I might get through treatment with the targeted drug, herceptin  and radiotherapy initially, I think I might of been  in a bit of denial maybe. Even thinking that I wouldn\u2019t need to put my kids through knowing about any of it, but as things unfold I realised it was the trust issue  and that in the best possible and in a way that they could handle it only in as much information as they needed that I needed to let my kids know and knowing it was going to be chemotherapy I decided to be fairly open about it in general as I knew there would be days I\u2019d meet people and I just wouldn\u2019t be myself and that I may be obviously be  unwell and I preferred to be clear about about it rather than people hearing the word and assuming around it. I chose a number mums at the school to tell about it and let them know that I was being open about it. People really shine at times like this and they want to help in any way that they can and the only real way that someone can help in this situation is to be support around school pick ups or drop-offs maybe bring one or more of the kids  to their sports practice on your talk for days. Also you know after the first round which are  your tricky days and it\u2019s good to arrange a play date for even one or more of them on those days, people are only too happy to help and I was lucky in that my rounds for every three weeks so earlier on I had more energy in the third week before next round and was able to have the kids over to. Regardless of whether you can or not people really want to help and I would take people up on it. I didn\u2019t so much for the first two rounds and then realised I really needed to get in gear  except help where I was offered. Also have amazing sister supporting me and friends who don\u2019t all live close by but would jump in the car and come if they\u2019re needed.. I tried the cold cap and though it\u2019s difficult with the jaw strap you adjust to the cold quickly. I do have a wig on the block here but aside from a helipad on my double crown and other even percentage loss, so far with clips and a shoulder length cut it\u2019s manageable... I wish you all the best with it Lizi, wising you well, Realtin⭐️",
