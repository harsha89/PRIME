      "Content": "Hi Tessa2 Sorry for not replying to your kind posts earlier.I had to get away from it all for a bit but had to face it again because the cancer is always there looming in the background. I went through a bunch of emotions and one of the worst was realising that all the time that I didn't know that the cancer was growing silently inside me. It made me feel that I had no control in my life, that there was nothing I could do and there's nothing I can do in the future. The trouble is I don't seem to be able to get over these feelings yet. They're always there at the back of my mind. Maybe it's because I start radiotherapy in the next few days or maybe it's because I hear things about cancer on television or radio and it always upsets me. I'm going to ask my breast care nurse about getting the info you got. Thanks so much. Take care and thanks for being so kind. Topsy xx",

      "Content": "Hi I'm fairly new to the site but everyone has been so kind and helpful that I have come back hoping people will share their experiences with me about radiotherapy and hormone therapy. I was diagnosed with DCIS, which was cut out. Then the removed tissue showed that I had IDC but that this had by chance been cut out too.They checked two of my lymph nodes and these were clear so now they are planning radiotherapy and hormone treatment for the cancer which was oestrogen and progesterone related so I have to have hormone test. Does anyone know what the hormone test involves? Has anyone found anything particularly helpful when going through radiotherapy? Finally, I know they have told me everything is OK but I'm worried about my other breast now and what might be waiting there. Have many people found that the other breast has become cancerous? Are there any clues that the first cancer gives that indicate if the second breast is going to go that way? I know this all sounds very silly but I feel I've been going up and down for over 2 months now and am not sure what to think. Thanks for being patient and helpful. Topsy.",

      "Content": "Hi Norvanstar Sorry for the long time before I replied. I think I closed down for a bit I couldn't handle everything and needed to walk away from it all for a while. I'm back though. I realised that I couldn't walk away from it forever as the cancer is always there ready to bite back. I hope your treatment is going well, I start mine in the next few days. I'll be thinking of you. Take care. Topsy xx",

      "Content": "Hello all Has anyone else had thinking, memory and speaking problems from taking Tamoxifen? Breast care team told me about this and have shown me research. I have put one link below which talks about effects after one year. Other research shows effects after five years. Link: http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/8/1294.abstract I'm getting help but if you have found something that helps I would love to know! Topsy. Â ",
