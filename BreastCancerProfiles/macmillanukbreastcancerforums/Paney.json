      "Content": "Hi there I have had my hair shaved and it is definitely better than my hair falling out in clumps. I have opted for the scarves and am enjoying (as much as you can!) experimenting with them. I have managed to buy some as contrast colours to match different outfits. i chose a chiffon scarf with a contrast to match my outfit for the wedding and received lots of positive comments. Not the same as having nicely styled hair but it didn't impair my enjoyment of the occasion too much. Second chemo was worse than the first - an extra day needed to recover. FOund this a bit distressing as I really thought I would cope better. Is the effect of the chemo cumulative? Will it be worse next time? Regards to all, Jane",

      "Content": "Hi. I am new to this site. I was diagnosed with breast cancer back in May. I have had 2 ops, lump removed and sentinal node biopsy and then all the nodes removed. Best news so far is that bone scan and CT are clear. My biggest hurdle is chemo and the hair loss. I had my first chemo almost 3 weeks ago and my hair is coming out now. I have made the decision to have all my hair shaved off. Tomorrow is D-day and I am not sure how I am going to react. My head is saying 'It's only 4 months without hair and it's worth it for a positive outcome'. My heart is heavy, I am going to a wedding on 30th August and feel that a beautiful outfit will be ruined by the wig or a scarf. My daughter is finding the hair loss quite upsetting. She is almost 11 and I guess appearances really count. Any thoughts or hints as to help her through it? She came to the wig fitting and the scarf tying lesson. She was pretty okay then but is quite upset now that the hair loss is a reality. Thanks for listening. Paney",

      "Content": "Hi I sit here quite moved by the fact that people take the time to reply when I am sure they all have their own ordeals to deal with. Today is D-day and I still feel a little apprehensive. However my hair loss has gone into overdrive and I can't stand the 'tufty' look and so I think I will be relieved by the end of today. Had a reasonably positive experience last night. Invited to supper with a group of ladies; 4 of whom are close friends and 5 who I didn't really know at all. As my hair was so thin I decided to wear a scarf. The comments were amazing - my closest friend was close to tears but was so positive in her comments that I felt so much better. It was also a hit with the children. My son thought I looked quite cool. Praise indeed from a 14 year old boy. My daughter was pleased that I had 'done it right' without her help! Will now spend some time trying to find the right scarf to compliment the wedding outfit! Again, thank you so much for your replies. I don't think I realised when I posted a comment yesterday just how much the replies would mean. I have greater strength to deal with the chemo tomorrow. THANKYOU. Paney.",
