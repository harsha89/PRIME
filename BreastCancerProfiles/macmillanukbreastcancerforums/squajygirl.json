      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this group having joined to see if anyone here survived breast cancer as long ago as I did? 27 years now, at the age of 39.  Long before the internet and social media!  No one talked about it in those days..... I was prescribed tamoxifen as soon as I was diagnosed, it shrank the tumour abound I had a lumpectomy a couple of months later followed by 5 weeks of radiotherapy.  I continued taking the tamoxifen as instructed and, yes, I did gain a little weight but not much.  It was quite a new drug in those days and not normally given to pre-menopausal women. There was no clear indication of how long it should be prescribed.  I was told I'd need to take it for a year, then when the year was up it was 2 years....then it was 5 years, and after 5 years they said take it indefinitely!!  I was on it for 13 years!  I didn't put on masses of weight so hopefully you won't either.  My problem now is pain and discomfort in the whole area of my left shoulder, back and front, and limited movement of my arm from the operation and radiotherapy.  There was no follow up information, except yes, everything's ok, no mention of the arm exercises I have read about on here.  No support groups, no one to talk to who understood what I was going through. I'm not going to say anyone who has this dreadful problem now is 'lucky ' but a lot has changed in those 27 years! .  I now also know that if you had radiotherapy more than ten years ago you could develop heart problems.... I thought my problems with this disease were long over and forgotten but it seems not.  Good luck to all those undergoing treatment at this time.  There is hope!  X",

      "Content": "Ah well I hope it gives some of the ladies out there hope!   No I didn't have chemo.  They didn't even give grades to them in those days!  Mine was described as 'oestrogen receptive '.   I've been back to hospital a couple of years ago because of these pains, but was assured there was nothing untoward other than the scar tissue thickening, and delayed effects of the cutting of muscle and nerves, and radiotherapy!!  He looked at me and said 'yes in those days they were only concerned about keeping you alive, not how you looked!'  Which is true of course.  I've only just read about the heart problems!   I don't believe (I hope!) I've developed anything like that, but I do have supra ventricular tachycardia (rapid heart beat) which I've only suffered three times in the last 14 months but realise my doctor doesn't have records on screen from before we moved16 months ago!  So they don't know I had breast cancer......  but I don't think it's connected as my sister had it and I understand it's not uncommon.   Thanks for listening!",

It comes and goes but mostly these days it's there!   Old age I guess! Thanks for your interest. ",

I was looking for support and have offered it to others in the process I hope, which is good.  It's really good to be able to talk about it after all this time. Yes I have other aches now at nearly 67!  So it's natural that my shoulder area is suffering, and strangely enough in the last couple of days it's actually felt better!  Getting it out there I think has helped!  How strange is that? Here's to the next 27 years! Love Pam x",
