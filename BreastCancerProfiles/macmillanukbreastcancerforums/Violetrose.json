How we would have coped with both of us ill I don't know. Im glad he doesn't have to watch me go through it. I will join the October Chemo club as you suggest as I could do with the support. Thank you so much. I appreciate all the help that's already being offered to me from all the lovely members on here. xxxx Sandra",

I know I am so much  more lucky than a lot of the wonderful people on here in that my cancer has been caught early, and I hope that I can get through it as bravely as you have all done.

I must admit that I too have thought why the heck am I being treated, I want to be with Tony, I asked to be with Tony and if I just refuse treatment then I would be with him again, and my mom and dad. But then auto pilot takes over and I go through all the motions of getting treatment, something else just kicks in and I do what I should be doing. Im so pleased that you met the man of your dreams and that you are so happy. You are blessed. xxxxxx  Enjoy your happiness to the full my darling. I will look at your blog when I work out how xxxxx Lots of love Sandra xxxxxx",

I will check out the Maggies Centre if there is one near here. I too am not good at support groups as such, but there comes a time when you have to accept help. Now Tonys gone I have to find another way of coping. Thank you xxxx Sandra",

I do tend to sleep a lot, I have done since my Tony went. Cocodamol has side effects doesn't it so it cant be pleasant. I will look into what you say about Maggies and Haven. I'm just getting my head around stuff. Thank you for the information on the exercise and gym. Looks like i'm going to have to be a healthier person. Thank you again, love and hugs right back at you xxxx Sandra",

      "Content": "Hello Heather I will get in touch with Cruse as suggested, its just getting my head around everything. Tony was my whole world, for 29 years and his empty seat on the sofa breaks my heart, but comforts me too as its dented where he sat.  The cancer diagnosis is just another problem to overcome at least that's how it feels. Also glad its me that has it and not someone else I love in my family. I couldn't cope with losing anyone else. Sorry to hear you too are alone but glad you have your friend who has helped you through your tough times. I used to work in London, luckily don't anymore and got to spend a lot of time with Tony over the last year when I changed to working nights, I was with him all day. Sounds like you have really been through the mill with your cancer, and its ongoing. At least I got the all clear, and the chemo is to prevent problems. You must be a very strong person, its amazing where the strength comes from isn't it? Good luck with the radiotherapy hope its not too awful. By storms I take it you mean problems etc. I know what you mean. I lost my mom and dad  within three months of each other in 2006. I only just started to feel like I was beginning to live again this year as I finally had the money to put a headstone on their grave, and it begins again. My poor Tony x I used a forum when I lost mom and it did get me through the dark days. Now though I dont have tony to lean on. I m sure this forum will be a lifeline xx I will get a freezer, I have to try and look after myself now. Tony always said that if he didn't cook we would live on sandwiches. How right was he? xxxx Take time to process all of this, Sandra, and please get another small freezer and eat a nutritious diet as your body really needs all the nutrients it can get now to deal with chemotherapy and also your grieving process. I have some people I know in the area but not who I would call friends. Im a solitary person, don't trust easily and keep my circle of fiends small. Unfortunately that circle lives in London, Tunbridge wells etc etc. I'm sure I will be fine, as you say I get emotional at times, then I just go to bed hahaha xxxx Thank you for taking time to talk to me, it helps in the chaos. Night night Sandra",

      "Content": "Thanks G n'J I just need to find the stop button on my merry go round and try and focus. I get phone counselling from the local hospice but don't feel any benefit of it. I would prefer to have face to face counselling and will look into it. So many things to get my head around. I still feel Tony with me. It was a very cruel and sudden way to lose him. We hadn't even had a diagnosis for him, the A&E department consultants just assumed we knew and blurted out he had stomach, liver and lung cancer. We only knew about a shadow on his lung. so not only have I lost him but the treatment we received was terrible and traumatic. I'm trying to stay strong for him, though part of me just wants to give up. I can see that there is loads of support here its great. Thank you so much xxxx Sandra",

      "Content": "Thank you Julia. I will get in touch with the nurses. I haven't been given a breast nurse? I went private through work and not sure if anyone does that for me?  I'm sorry to hear that you also went through such a bad time losing your dad, and then being hit with BC. Its good to hear you are out the other side of the treatment. I hope my survival instinct kicks in. I feel so exhausted already. I am strong, its just all my family are so far away and me and Tony were such solitary people. We didn't mix much so I'm pretty much on my own.They are going to do the treatment at home and i'm not sure if this is just because the private hospital doesn't have the facilities. they do have a day case unit there. Do you think this is best for me or should I be with nurses? I can see that so many people on here have been through so much, and their ability to laugh and carry on is amazing. I  will no doubt be on here a lot. Sandra x",

      "Content": "Hi Helen Thank you for your post. A loss is a loss and we had many pets at home when I was a kid and know how much they mean to their owners. My old mom and dad used to have loads and when we left home it broke their hearts when one of the animals died. This has interrupted my grieving and its a worrying thing as I know that it means its bottled up. I know nature takes over and helps you to cope with only what you can, but it has to be dealt with at some point. Im off work of course, first because of Tony, then straight into this. I will need to find things to do if I'm up to it. I was going to get a cat or dog but now cant as wont be able to look after them properly. I couldn't go back to work as my job calls for full concentration amending legal documents and I just know I cant do it. So I will have to see what I can do locally if anything. Hmmmm guinea pig....... now there's an idea. Thank you for being there, im not so alone now xxxx Take care and no more showers on the guinea pig xxxxx Sandra",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm 49 and I have recently had a lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer. Luckily I caught it early and it hasn't spread but I will need chemo and radiotherapy. I'm so scared. Having been told what chemo involves cant get my head around losing my hair of all things. I lost my lovely partner of 29 years to cancer in June this year. He found out how ill he was only five days before he died we had no idea.I discovered the lump in July and had it removed on 14 September. Its been a hard time and I'm not sure how to cope with what's ahead. I have no family where I live and was in the process of packing up my house to move closer to family when I found out about the breast cancer. So now all that's on hold and I am about to start treatment. I just don't know if I can cope. I miss my partner so much. I wished I was dead too when he died and kept thinking about peace. I feel like I have wished this on myself and I deserve it. I wish I knew how to cope.",
