      "Content": "Ahhh, but you see, here is the catch - we haven't got any family around to help us... I truly wish I could let someone else do the cooking and tiding (as for the cleaning, we had to get a cleaner), but there isn't anyone. There is so much you can rely on friends, as accomodating and as helpful as they might be, because after all, they all have their own lives and their own families. My husband will be off work until September, which would be a great help, but even so, I hate \"letting go\" of all the things I should and would be doing if I could. And they are the silliest of things, like doing my little girl's bath, or cooking her breakfast. I already find it hard because of the baby, and now I may not even be able to look after him! I'm devastated. Were you really THAT exhausted by the treatment like they say you become? Will I really be \"out of action\" completely??  ",

      "Content": "THANK YOU SlinfoldCopper! You basically said exactly what I wanted to hear... that I am doing the right thing (logically I know I am, but emotionally...) and that it IS for them as much as it is for me. And thank you so much for sharing your own experience about quitting breastfeeding. I tear up every time (honestly, every time) I either think or talk about it but it never occurred to me that it might be also hormonally-linked. Maybe when my body adjusts I'll feel better about it. God, I hope so. I felt fine right after the first chemo session on Thursday, but now I feel really quite sick. Haven't been throwing up, just off my food (oh, that lovely metallic taste in your mouth that I read about in all the forums) and feeling nauseated. Thankfully a friend took big sister out for a couple of hours, and baby fell asleep so managed to grab an hour's nap. Don't know if I am tired because of the night feedings or because of the treatment, but generally feel quite sorry for myself. I hate feeling sorry for myself! What a stupid waste of time. I normally manage to snap out of these moods quickly... I have to, don't I? Thanks again for the support, it means a lot coming from someone who \"has been there\".",

      "Content": "Thank you very much, blue70. Unfortunately I do not live in London, but I do appreciate the though - it is very kind of you to offer. I am apprehensive about the start of the treatment tomorrow. My little girl (4) burst into tears this afternoon because she thought I would have to stay in hospital again (like I did when I had the mastectomy) and said she wanted to \"come with you to the doctors\". As stupid as this may sound, I wouldn't care half as much about being diagnosed if I didn't have children. It's the way it's affecting them - my daughter being upset, my baby having to go on to formula milk instead of breastfeeding - that is really bringing me down. I feel like I am letting them down and there is nothing I can do about it. Bahhh... just feel awful.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I am starting my chemo this coming Thursday (14 July) and am really dreading it. If the chemo wasn't bad enough on its own, I have a 4 years-old daughter and a three WEEKS old little boy! So I am starting the treatment already very tired! (I was diagnosed whilst pregnant) Has anyone here had to deal with the effects of chemo whilst caring for small children/babies? Do you have any tips? I'm so worried I won't be able to do anything for my little boy and that he won't bond with me because of that... Thanks",
