      "Content": "Hi, I work for a company and we have stores located across the country, we currently dont stock mastectomy bras and ive had a lot of ladies come in asking for these or a non-wired bra. (we have two, neither were suitable). I was deeply affected by this especially as my mother in law has had a mastectomy and has to order bras online and cant try them on in a local store! my manager has agreed that if i can gather some information together to show head office then i can present it to them to show that we should stock bras for women to come and try on. If anyone could help by just saying what they look for in a post surgery bra then it would be much appreciated! I just want to be able to help all women that come into store to be fitted.",

      "Content": "grannymush37 Hi May22 Having always worn  an underwire bra trying to find one without wires was a nightmare and not one I had expected to come up against. My biggest bug bear was that the bras that I looked at were very expensive so I went o Asda an bought two soft sports type bras with pads in and they are great. Have any of you had any issue trying to find a modern nightdress( not one that your granny might like) with buttons down the front as well- my god that was a trial as well. Thank you for getting back to me ...one lady I spoke to said she still can't wear a wired bra 4 years after surgery. If you don't mind me asking have you recently had surgery. I'm pleased you managed to find something that works for you, I wish it could have been easier! ( this is my aim) ",

      "Content": "Littlesusie You don't say where your stores are located but you wil know what a nightmare buying bras is. IF the department stores stock them at sall it's usually for the ladies who have \"stock size\" breasts and us larger ladies aren't catered for. My local larger M&S stocked post surgery bras for a short period and then withdrew them. I've had reconstruction/reduction surgery so am now a good deal smaller but I know that when I do start buying again I'll need specialist measuring and that isn't easy to find. We have stores nationwide but I'm actually in Bath in Somerset at the moment. I'm trying to make them available in as many stores as I can and all this feedback really helps! I can definitely agree with you that there is so little out there for larger breasted ladies. Ive just handed lots of information over to my manager for head office about all areas not just bath and Somerset. I really hope to achieve something! ",
