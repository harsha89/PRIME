      "Content": "Thanks for your replies - very much appreciated. The experience in theatre was just awful. I never knew putting needles into the back of your wrist could be so very painful. I've never been needle phobic but any needle frightens me now. I'm usually such a just get on with it person but I'm not feeling so strong anymore.  I forgot to mention that the muscle that has been used to create my boob feels like it's sliding around and it contracts when I make any movement. I wonder if anyone else has experienced that. Scared_2 - did anyone ever say why you had to walk into the theatre too? I just don't understand why we had to do that. JJsailor - I had my surgery in Plymouth. When the surgeon explained about the LD flap he described the procedure but never said I'd be walking into theatre. I got everything prepared in my mind about what would happen but in fact it was so dreadfully different. He didn't tell me about the chest tightness and how I might end up looking. I feel like the old me is screaming to get out of my body and I'll never ever be the happy positive person I was. I so wish I never agreed to the reconstruction and I don't feel I was prepared for the reality of relentless discomfort, constant tightness and my butchered body. ",

      "Content": "2 weeks ago I had a bilateral masectomy with immediate LD flap reconstruction. I would like to know other ladies experience of this as I'm really struggling. I'm still in pain and struggling to do everyday tasks. I've been doing the recommended exercises every day but it hurts when I move. I get tired very quickly and sometimes feel lightheaded. My chest feels like it has been wrapped in duct tape and the skin stretched to its absolute limit. I have a roll of flesh under each arm which is really uncomfortable and feels like a roll of newspaper tucked under my arm - it's very uncomfortable. The worst is my new boobs. I'm a realist and wasn't expecting perfection but I hate them. I feel totally butchered. They are misshapen - my flesh seems to go around my chest and until my arms in one sausage. I'm tearful when I look at my so called boobs or when I think of the operation. For some reason I had to walk into the actual theatre before I was anaesthetised - I got on the table and the doctors starting putting needles in my wrist. It was the worst pain I've ever experienced and I was screaming. In the end one of the Drs was shouting that they should gas me which eventually they did. I'm traumatised by this experience as I just don't understand why I had to go through that - it makes me cry to even think of it as I hated screaming and being so much out of control. I've read the recovery for my operation is about 4 weeks but I just don't see or feel I'll be anywhere near recovery.  So - does anyone have any experience of this operation. How long does the tightness feeling last? Is the shape of my boobs just the way they are going to be and does the roll of flesh under the arms go away?How long was recovery and when did you manage to go back to work? Did anyone else go straight into the actual theatre before they were aneasthetised? The surgeons drew on me on the ward but they never said I'd have to walk into the theatre.  I've tried to contact my breast care nurse but after several messages on her answer machine she hasn't been in touch. I see my surgeon in a couple of weeks but I'm dreading it. I just don't know what to say to him. I appreciate the fact the cancer has gone but how do I say I feel and look so butchered? I know I'm just going to burst into tears.  I'd really appreciate any replies and thank you so much for reading this. It's a release to write it all down ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much everyone for your kindness and support. I've always been the perceived strong one in my family - always happy - always positive. I don't feel strong, happy or positive. The last time I had breast cancer was only 2 1/2 years ago. I joked and laughed my way through it. Now I wish it had never been discovered - that it had quietly carried on growing and spreading. It's almost like I have a death wish. My husband steps  aside on the very rare occasions when I show any emotion. We have not had sex ever since my first diagnosis . In July - on my birthday and also our wedding anniversary - I found out he'd been looking at porn on the Internet. I cried the whole day and he avoided me like the plague. My sons show very little interest when I tell them about my forthcoming surgery. One just said - what are we having for tea. So what's the point really. I know I will be expected to carry on as normal the minute I get home from hospital. Even my work said I should be back at work a week after surgery. I have no idea if that's a normal recovery time. I very much doubt they would give me any time off to go to any support groups and I can't go off sick - I don't get sick pay. So - sorry for going on - it helps to write it all down. My Dad died in March and sometimes I feel like joining him. I feel totally invisible. ",

I'm tired of putting a brave face on it. I'm naturally a positive person and I feel this high expectation from others to smile and laugh my way through it. I can't let my mask slip and I can't face comforting others if they knew how frightened I am. My husband is indifferent. My grown up sons never ask how I am. I have no close friends. I feel I am facing this alone and I'm drowning. ",

I was just wondering if other ladies in a similar situation to me had experienced the same hardening of the lump and soreness. I have tried googling it and still can't find anything. Perhaps I'm the only one experiencing this - if so - I'm really worried :-(",

      "Content": "Thank you so much everyone for your replies and apologies for not responding earlier. I've been having some very down days and am struggling. I was beginning to think the hardening of the lump was a bad sign so its reassuring to know you other ladies have experienced something similar. I'm starting 3 rounds of tax and herceptin next week then it willI be surgery, rads and continuation of the herceptin for a year. I've got a very supportive husband but I've never really had friends so this forum is great for reassurance. I just hope I can feel better about the whole situation. I'm convinced that as I'm her2 that I won't survive this and even if I did it would just return in a couple of years as its so aggressive. I can't get that thought out of my mind. Anyway........I wish all of you the very best and huge hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. This is my first post. I have grade 2 invasive ductal cancer which is her2 positive. I was diagnosed on New Year's Eve 2012. I've had 3 rounds of fec chemo. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced hardening and soreness of the lump during chemo? I just can't seem to find out if this is normal. My oncologist just says he'll keep an eye on it so I still don't know if the hardening always happens with other patients. I would really appreciate any thoughts or experiences anyone has. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and of course best wishes to everyone. x",
