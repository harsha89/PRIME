    "Content": "Hi. i am new too. My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. She is now a widow of 2 years and my brother and i live locally.. It has been very stressful time. We were getting our heads around her 3rd knee replacement, preparing to take leave from work etc.the lumpectomy came out of the blue, and the knee replacement was put on the back burner My fear was the lengh of time the lump had been undetected., the main health issue had been her knee, and difficulty in walking and that was was mom was focussing on.The breast cancer was a total shock and difficult to take in. I wanted to be strong and supportive, but waiting for the biopsy results on that thursday i was a total mess. I wanted to feel prepared when we saw the consultant .so i phoned the macmillon help line and spoke to a nurse, who gave me pointers to ask the consultant and what to expect.. I felt so much relief, after i had shed a tear or two, i felt stronger to support my mom.I felt in control with my list of questions, as my mom was'nt able to take it all in. I had a note book at the ready and felt focussed. We go back this thursday to get the results from the lymth glands  that were removed during the lumpectomy. Am hoping everything will be clear. then Tamoxifen will commennce and RT. I have learnt to look for information and feel better for the knowledge, less of a worry.I am also discussing it with friends, and learning of so many. people out there that have been touched by this illness I hope this helps in some small way, and if you want to chat i am checking in every night. Take care.  ",
