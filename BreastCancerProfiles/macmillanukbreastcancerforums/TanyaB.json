    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with breast cancer just before Christmas and it has also spread to my bones. I had a tumour 5.5cms and was told I would need to have a mastectomy but I had to have chemotherapy first to reduce the tumour. I have since had 6 treatments of chemo, and the tumour 'disappeared' after the second treatment. My consultant was quite astonished at how well I responded to the chemo. My consultant has advised me that I could choose to have a mastectomy but it would make little difference to me if I have the surgery.(she informed me that if I didn't have the spots in my bones,then she would have insisted on the surgery). I decided not to have the surgery and now will have radiotherapy everyday for 4 weeks and given tamoxifen. I have looked on the internet to see if I can find anyone who has had a similar experience but can't find anything. Everyone seems to have had surgery of some sort. I'm wondering whether I've done the right thing. I have a 21 month old son, I'm so worried that I won't see him grow up. Tanya",
