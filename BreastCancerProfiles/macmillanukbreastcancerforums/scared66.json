      "Content": "Hi, Had a couple of rough years having been diagnosed with Non-hodgkins lymphoma and more recently breast cancer. thankfully both are in remission.. I'm dealing ok with the mental aspects (I think) but am struggling on Tamoxifen. So the hot flushes and night sweats are rubbish and definitely worse since starting the tablets. My main concern is I don't seem to want to stop eating, the only way I can explain it is its like PMT (well what I remember of it, as my last one was 3 years ago) but constant. Just wondering if anyone else was feeling this way and what they did/do to curb it. Best wishes Sarah :)",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies, i sort of feel  better I'm not imagining this. So I was naturally going through the menopause and the cancer was found  in a round about way due to a check up of my hrt meds. I'm trying sage tablets for the hot flushes (they really are making me feel rubbish) and trying to eat healthily l. I guess it's one step at a time Best wishes Sarah x",

      "Content": "Hi I'm 16 week post surgery and 5 weeks post rt for stage 1 bc hormone receptive. The cancer was 13 millimetres (so in my mind tiny). The diagnosis, to cut a very long story short came as a total shock and was only detected as I decided I better rebook my mammogram as I'd previously cancelled it 18 month ago due to going through rt for another cancer (folicular lymphoma). I had absolutely no symptoms (well apart from tiredness which I put down to the menopause). I know I struggled with the after effects of rt last time but this time I'm really struggling I'm so tired. I'm an emotional wreck and feel so guilty about being signed off from work again. I'm currently awaiting appointments with the bc nurse and oncologist which hopefully will put my mind at rest as my breast feels very hard and sore (but then it has been through 2 lumpectomies in 4 weeks (didn't get clear margins the first time) so I suppose the pain is to be expected). Sorry for the ramble just wanted to work out if how I'm feeling is normal",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your kind words and pointing me in a direction of useful article/excercise. I think a lot of the problem is I expect too much of myself and  trying to rush feeling normal (what ever that may be). In reality I've been through two different primary cancers, two bouts of rt, numerous ct scans, 2 pet scans, a bone marrow biopsy and three ops in the space of 25 months so time to admit it's not surprising I feel rubbish both mentally and physically. I also made possibly a really bad discission in ceasing to take medication for depression without guidance from doctor as initially post treatment  I felt a kind of euphoria but have subsequently nose dived. I have a telephone appointment with my doctor tomorrow as she wanted to check in with me prior to going on holiday. I suspect I will go back on anti depressants which though I hate the perceived stigma (all mine as I come from a \"suck it up\" background) I think is currently the right move. Bye for now. Hugs to all going through this",
