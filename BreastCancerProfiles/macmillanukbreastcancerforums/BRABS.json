    "Content": "Hi Mazza, Im new to the group, but like you fell into that dark hole when chemo finished, and while still having Herceptin . Everything  you describe was,  so familiar to me, anxiety panic attacks etc.I also went on medication and attended a psychologist, and believe me Mazza, it does get better. I was trying to be so strong ,protecting the family, and not talking about how I really felt. As you said ,you really have to be on this journey to understand it.Looking back now I do realise that the treatment is hard on the body, not just physically but mentally also, and unfortunately there are not enough resourses to look after our emotional needs, which is every bit as important as the physical needs'.So for anyone else out there suffering similiar, I would say please look after yourselves and seek help.You deserve it. God Bless you all, love to all",
