    "Content": "Hi, I had treatment last year FEC-T and cold capped throughout. I lost a lot of hair but kept enough to keep me happy. It ended up a bit like an undercut but I felt confident enough to go out without any head covering or wig. My hair length prior was a short bob and I've now gone shorter. I'm really glad I did it. Good luck with the rest of your treatment. X",
