    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed at 30 will be 32 this year. I was hormone positive and her 2 positive, I did 6 rounds of chemo surgery and radiotherapy.  I shared my diagnosis with family only and very fortunate to keep my hair thanks to paxman. I have went back to life as before which a year ago I would never of imagined, back to work and feel maybe even better than before. I only log on here now and again because when I was diagnosed I was petrified because of dr google but I hope my story can bring u some hope and steer u away from dr google. Yes treatment is horrible especially chemo but there is light after it all. If u have a maggies centre nearby I would encourage u to go,  they are very good. At first I was in denial and wanted no help, then one day I went down there in floods of tears, they helped build me massively and still keep in touch with anything they think will benefit me. I also met 4 girls ages similar to me there, and it was great for me to see ladies a similar age as until I went there I was convinced I was alone being young with breast cancer. Yes this year will be tough but u will get through treatment and back to life as before ",
