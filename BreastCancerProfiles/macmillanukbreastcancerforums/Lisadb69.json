      "Content": "Thank you all for your messages. I will pass your messages on to her husband. He has sent me a message tonight saying she didn't suffer for long - which is a blessing. He has told their sons tonight (individually) & they have said she is a star looking down on them - I had another cry. I met Annabel through breast cancer care & we had been going to the forum in Leicester together in June. Shame she was never able to go. I have been lucky in that my bc was treated & since April I have finished my treatment & other than a scare this month I am ok (all okay after scare). Annabel kept saying how ill she felt but I can not get my head around no one at the hospitals seemed to take any notice until it was too late. They had given her so much hope & if you read one of her posts her husband feared they were not being told the whole truth. Perhaps if the truth had been told she would have been able to have one last christmas with her family. Sorry just putting my thoughts down in writing. Love to you all & I will message her husband & let him know xx",

I have had a call this morning from Annabels husband to tell me she sadly passed away yesterday. I didn't know what to say & still don't. She really was very very poorly & unfortunately it was all too much for her body. I am so so sorry to be posting this. Love Lisa xx",
