      "Content": "That's very poor -I would ring again .Also stopping your CBT surely that can be done alongside all that is happening but maybe adapted .I had to pay privately for CBT as there was a 9 month wait via mental health  services - my therapist has adapted input to support me through a pretty turbulent time due to possible secondary diagnosis .Can you challenge their decision to stop support ? If you have a local cancer charity they are usually pretty good and quick at offering support . Sometimes it's exhausting trying to get the support you need isn't it .",
