      "Content": "Hi Pat, I have a couple of patches of bad rad burns on my neck but luckily have not blistered which maybe down to the 'Geliperm' dressings the radiologist gave me and subsequently got a prescription for more from my GP.  They are a hydrogel dressing which I use for about 20 mins, twice a day which take the heat out of the burn for a while and I use E45 lotion afterwards. Obviously with your skin being broken I'm not which cream/lotion you could use.  Also, I have heard about Manuka honey dressings but like you I'm not sure about them.  Perhaps a bit of internet surfing may come up with the answer. Have you spoken to your GP about the amount of pain you're in.  You shouldn't be having to put up with it.  Thump a few tables if necessary! Helen xx",

      "Content": "Hi Pat, I don't know if these will help you at all but ask if lidocaine dressings will help with the pain.  After 5 months I'm still suffering with pain (neuropathic as well as musculo-skelatal) from the surgery and as part of the pain control regime given to me by the pain team I was given these patches which are ok to use on iradiated skin and which actually cool it down as well.  Don't accept second best or excuses from the hospital.  You deserve the best!. Lots of love,  Helen xx PS If my posts sound a bit stuffy, it's the accountant in me.  I'm not too good at expressing emotions, etc.  All the best for tomorrow.  Thump some tables if necessary.  If you're not satisfied, go to the top.",

      "Content": "Hi Debra, Thanks for replying.  I've contacted my Oncologist's secretary and have got an appointment to suit me but have heard nothing from the surgeon as yet.  Not that I want to, particularly, because of the state of the surgery.  Probably silly I know but it's the way that I feel. Lots of love, Helen xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I know there are lots of you ladies out there who are and have been in a much worse state than myself. I was diagnosed in Sep 11, had 3 months of hormone therapy treatment before surgery for a left mastectomy and total left lymph node clearance in Feb 12 followed by 3 weeks of radiotherapy in May 12, at a hospital 40 miles away from where I live, and now back on the hormone therapy treatment. Because of slight heart problems and the fact that I responded well to the hormone therapy treatment it is has been decided that I do not have to have any chemotherapy. Having seen several ladies on chemotherapy when I was an in-patient for 10 days during my radiotherapy treatment I know I am very lucky with regards to that. I was an in-patient because after only 2 days of radiotherapy I was experiencing aggravation to the severe nerve damage I had already suffered from the surgery. Also, besides the nerve damage I have problems with the surgery site or should I say 'butchery'. So much pain for so long. The hospital which did the surgery is not the same one where I had the radiotherapy. If it wasn't for the lovely people at the hospital where I had the radiotherapy I would still be so much pain from surgery. Since being diagnosed I have received very little contact/support from the BC nurses and feel as though I've been just left to get on with it. Most of the time I have remained fairly positive but now I just feel abandoned wondering where do I go from here. I know that in about 4 - 6 weeks time there should be a follow up appointment with the Oncologist and should have a scan to check on my heart. Even though I have the support of a couple of really good friends and my son there are increasingly more times when I feel lonely and very tearful. This Fri, I start a Relaxation and Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation Practices Course in the hope this will help me. The course was suggested to me by a lovely lady, a Macmillan Counsellor, when I was an in-patient during my radiotherapy treatment. As the Forum topic says, I'm having a bad day at the office and needed to share my thoughts. I hope you ladies don't mind. My thoughts are with you all, Helen xx",

      "Content": "Hi AA, if I were you I'd contact your chemo nurse (if they're available on a Sun) first to check if it's ok to use the canestan and then see your doctor/nurse tomorrow but if its really bad I'd go to your local walk-in centre - if you have one near you. I have been lucky that I've not had to have any chemo as yet, but that may change in the not too distant future. I hope your infected seroma is ok now. My heart goes out to you and all those on chemo. Lots of big hugs and love from Helen xx",
