    "Content": "I have just finished my chemo I was on Taxetere too. I found that I was very thirsty so kept drinking loads of water. Yes I had the sore mouth and throat too but only for a couple of days. Rest when you need to and don't push yourself. Good luck and let us know how your doing. I have my op on June 23rd, am quite jittery right now about it but keeping my fingers crossed. Love and all the best. Emma",
