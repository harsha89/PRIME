      "Content": "JUst thought I would share two creams I am finding really help post-RT and with all teh dryness from Tamoxifen as well:  1. Elizabeth Arden 8-hour cream. Not very eco-friendly I think, but I used it 15 years ago on my then baby girl's backside and it worked wonders! Have sworn by it for a multitude of skin problems since.  2. coconut oil: if you are anti manifactured potions then this is the best option. Pure Coconut oil. Yep you do end up stinking like a Bounty Bar but there are worse things\u2026.I use it for large areas that need softening. For smaller areas and also nails  I use almond oil.  Someone has gone out to buy me a very special (and natural) scar removing lotion which I think is based on cacao. I will let you know how that works when I have started using it! Bio-OIl didnt work for my son's (regular) scarring so I thought I would look for an alternative. Watch this space! ",

      "Content": "I live overseas so am not sure about purchasing in the UK. Good to know that coconut oil is available though - as I am relocating back in April and will be needing some! During the RT  I also drank coconut water daily from a fresh coconut and took watermelon juice every evening -both have great hydrating properties.  I didnt actually use any cream or oil on the RT days - just aloe vera (95%). I was worried about turning into a frying pan if I poured on the coconut oil and then went under the beam! ( by the way - it is good to cook with too - can take high temperatures and adds yumminess to stir fries and rice). I started using the creams at weekends and now daily since I have finished the RT. x",

      "Content": "am interested and delighted that they are offering you the genetic testing. I think maybe willingness depends on the authority you fall under. Am thinking of overseas/private testing for me and my daughter, for similar reasons. NHS said no - but maybe I should approach them again. That whole Angelina Jolie thing keeps being thrown at me by doctors, as if to say she has caused a rush on demand for the tests and they cant keep up. I didnt even know about it ( I was living overseas for 9 years) until a doctor told me though!!  Brave woman on your decision - maybe a no-brainer but still a very brave decision and I salute you! I hope it all goes well for you. (and maybe teach your daughter how to pack the lunches!!!   ; ) )  xx",
