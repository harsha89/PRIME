      "Content": "Hi Sharon I am due to have my reconstruction in July.  Apart from recovery time, has the LD flap restricted your range of movement? I have always been really active, running and cycling and hope it doesn't effect me too much.  I am a 34 C and don't have enough tissue to create a breast without an implant! I am also having mastectomy on RB and an implant with synthetic mesh over it. I'm going on holiday 3 months after operation,so i am hoping for a good quick recovery!!  Hope your enjoying life again x",

      "Content": "Hi.  I had left mastectomy one year ago today.  An expander was put in during the same op (4 hours).  I am to have an implant and LD flap over the top of implant in July in one procedure.  Iv'e been told it's a 6 hour procedure.   I had a lot of advice from reconstruction nurse, also I met other women who have had these procedures in the past.  At a support group organised by recon nurse, actually got to look at the results! it really helped.  Hope this helps, good luck to your Mum X",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon It is good to know the reconstruction hasn't affected you to much physically.  I did have lymph nodes removed, and managed through exercise and swimming to get my full range of movement back.  I feel reassured that if i do the same after recovery period, i should be able to continue with most things. I have started yoga and this has been a great help, too, thanks so much for getting back to me. X",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah I am sorry that you and your family are going through this life shattering ordeal!  I had  stage 2 BC in march, had mastectomy in April and have last chemo in 2 weeks. I have 10 and 5 year old daughters, whom ive kept informed all the way.  I have been matter of fact with both of them, but making time for each one to one to reassure and update as my treatment continues.  I also explained to their circle of friends parents what was actually happening, so friends wouldn't ask them unexpectedly at school etc.  This was beneficial for my 10 year old especially as she has been really emotional at times! and wasn't in any state to explain.  Her friends and teachers have been wonderful. From my own experience, and seeing how brilliantly my girls have accepted it all, as a phase that we need to deal with.  Id say  Involving them is the only way to get through it, We talked about the op, they saw my scar! lots of questions which helped them and me.  They helped me bath, dress and exercise.  We've even had lots of laughs and silly conversations about it, which was hard but trying to tell them something unimaginable.  I'd try anything to ensure they were prepared for the changes. I have also had support from my local hospice, just talking to experienced people has helped me.  They often just suggest something i'd normally do, but when your in a state of shock and not thinking clearly it's hard focus on what is the right thing to do.   I hope I have managed to help a little Take Care Charlotte",
