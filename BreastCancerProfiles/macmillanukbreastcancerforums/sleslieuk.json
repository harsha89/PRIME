      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed October 2012 with Grade 3 IDC. Massive, massive shock. When I came round from my op for MX my first question was had the surgeon removed any lymph nodes and of course the answer was yes. I fell into a deep depression at this news. 15 out of 19 involved. Scans were clear though. Started FEC-T in November and just completed the third FEC and now onto the delights of T. I am 47 and live in North West Norfolk and am being treated in King's Lynn and will have radiotherapy in Cambridge. All best wishes Sarah ",
