    "Content": "Hi Anne I had my first EC last Thursday and got the typical side effects from nauseas, tiredness, joint and muscle aches, and felt like I had a major hangover but taking all the melds help. I am doing much better today just tired and some tightness on left arm. Hopefully the next treatments gets better? Anyone with any advice on how to overcome the tiredness and any nutritional or holistic therapy advice can provide? Thanks",
