      "Content": "Hi jacks77 -I am at the same stage as you. I had nausea during my first few sessions and my GP prescribed some anti- sickness, but this could have been more due to my motion sickness (they have to move the bed through 90deg a few times) than because of the Therapy. I have felt very tired and sometimes queasy in the evenings, but this has worn off over the weekend. Start again on Monday so will have to see how it goes. Best of luck - hope it improves for you. ",

      "Content": "Hi There Just to say I have managed to continue to exercise too, for a mood and body booster! :+) I moved my exercise bike into my bedroom so that it is there as a reminder morning and evening. I usually manage 20 mins at different paces depending on where I am in the cycle and sometimes go on to use my cross trainer afterwards building up to the next dose. I then go for a 'cooling' and revitalising 'stomp' for about 3-5k in the lanes around my house sometimes with a little 'trot' up the hilly bits (I used to run the 5k and am looking forward to starting again in the spring -with this weather running in snow boots is different :+) - although I believe one of the African runners trained in hob nail boots! - so maybe there is hope for me yet!) I am pacing myself at work mainly because the one hour commute is in heavy, fast (60-80mph) traffic, with lots of side roads joining (and yes people do pull straight out!) and then very slow city traffic with lots of hargy- bargy and while I am on the post chemo anti emetics and steroids I am a little off my head and feel a possible accident is avoided by not driving on those days. I am also taking one or two extra days to fit in some nice things to mood boost. I have also arranged for Weds (I work Mon- Fri) so that I have a 'rest' day in the middle of my week - it is also my PICC line day and I try to arrange Oncology appts then too. This is because I want to give myself the best possible chance to come out the other end feeling ok. It means that I can be chirpy at work so they get a positive vibe from me. I do have to be quite strict with them though and remind them that I need these days or I could deteriorate rapidly and then I wouldn't be any help at all and they would be struggling to cover the workload. I was told by a colleague that this was possibly detrimental to my sick record, but at 60 am I bothered? ;+) This story is meant as a - we are all different and you have to do what's best for you story -meant to reassure and motivate- not as an example. Hope all goes well for everyone :+)",

      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose We are all holding hands with you on this one. The worst waits for were waiting for the definitive results and operation and then between the operation and start of chemo. I felt quite sick with frustration on occasion and worrying not sleeping didn't help. The What Ifs are ghastly. I found it best to remember how I was before I knew and ask myself do I actually - physically feel any different - and I had to say no - physically I was the same - I could still do the things I enjoyed before the investigations and diagnosis so why wouldn't I focus on doing those things now instead of pacing and angsting, so I arranged to do some nice things as a distraction - walks, lunches out, cinema etc. I did phone the breast care nurse with questions between appointments and they were also very reassuring.  The wait will be over soon and they you can make a plans with your husband to get you both through this stronger than before. Best wishes :+)x",

      "Content": "Hi there I am 60 similar diagnosis, but my tumour was only 1.2cm so they did the surgery first. It was classed as grade 2 and as there were cells in the lymph node they removed they suggested FEC chemo(same drugs as you but maybe different amount - I am having 75) and then radiotherapy and then a suitable drug for menopausal women. I had a PICC line put in and have had my chemo hand delivered by a nurse every three weeks. I am having 6 lots the last lot is next week.They administer the chemo from an array of syringes in a private room - they infuse an anti sickness drug through a pump throughout running it throug first for a while and then start to inject the chemo. The whole delivery plus chit chat Takes about 45mins to an hour. I am having my treatment at Torbay Hospital in Devon. The team there are excellent and always make me feel relaxed and welcome and know how to cheer me up. I really do appreciate them. They will also listen and answer questions if I have any. So do talk to your team and ask questions.  I have been really lucky and have had a few of the side effects, but (touch wood) nothing requiring hospitalisation. I have kept a certain level of exercise up (I was reasonably fit when entering this) and force myself to eat and drink (even though the side effects sometimes really make it quite difficult) as I know I need sufficient nutrients and fluid to remain functional and out of hospital! I have also managed to work a reasonable amount which has helped to keep some kind of normality in my life. (I take the week off post chemo and then work MonTues Thurs and Fri - taking the Weds off as a rest day as after 2 full days I feel tired. If you say which hospital you have your chemo through someone might be going through the same thing and you could then have a direct comparison.  Hope everything goes well for you too.",

      "Content": "Hi Scarlettem I have had 2 lots of FEC and just had my third one today. I do keep myself doing a small amount of exercise most most days and drink plenty (there has been some nurse research that shows that being well hydrated can mitigate side effects in some patients and I know from personal experience, it can make it easier to cannulate) and make sure I eat ok. I do the injections as instructed. On the first round on the 6th night I had what I can only describe as 'contractions' down either side of my pelvis. I took my temperature and pulse as it was normal, I took some paracetamol and then did the same 4-6 hours later with Ibuprofen and alternated them which took the pain away for me, taking my temperature and pulse each time prior to taking anything. I did phone the ward number I had been given and they said that I was doing the right thing at that time so you must phone yourself if you have symptoms a vigilant nurse will add it to the MHRA website as a side effect hopefully! The Oncologist didn't think it caused this kind of effect, but as I wasn't taking anything else at the time and I had seen elsewhere on this site that this had happened to someone else so maybe he had just not come across it before. Reassuringly the symptoms only lasted 24 hours - I woke up at the same time the following night expecting pain and it had gone! yay! The second time around I drank more and upped the exercise and it wasn't as bad or as long - yay- again. You have to do what is right for you and your body though. Hopefully things will go smoothly for you too x",

Sounds like you are doing all the right things to get yourself out - do meet up with friends if possible and chat to anyone on here.

I think it is very applicable to anyone who has gone through a life changing, event, illness or diagnosis, I am certainly going to take it into work for everyone to read ( I work in Healthcare). I will bear all the information in mind when I get through the 'one day at a time' bit of the treatment! I remember one of my bosses turning to me after my husband died rapidly at 47 over 5 months about 14 years ago, she said 'We will soon have you back to normal' I turned to her and said - 'I'm sorry but after what has happened I don't know what normal is and probably never will.' I know she meant well by her shocked reaction, but obviously had no understanding. I did change my life and found a new career that I love so that I could motivate my teenage sons, showing them that just because life gives you knocks you don't stay down you get up and work them out! I must have worked through the set he talks about in the healing process without even knowing! :+) It is really useful to have it mapped out.  Thank you againX",

He rushed through everything and didn't listen so I have insisted on seeing the Oncologist I first saw who was lovely and asked questions to confirm information I had given him, different style altogether! I was then told about him being a locum and that he had since left, they seemed to understand when I said his style didn't suit my personality so I think there had been others who had the same reaction as me.
