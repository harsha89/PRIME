      "Content": "Hi, I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same diagnosis or similar?  I was referred (eventually, but that's another story) with an enlarged lymph node in my left armpit, a biopsy showed that there was cancer in the lymph node.  I went on to have a mastectomy of my left breast and all my lymph nodes removed from left arm.  I saw my consultant last week who informed me that neither the breast or the rest of the lymph nodes had any cancer in them, apparently I have cancer with an unknown primary but they suspect breast because the cells in the original lymph node were breast cancer cells.  I am also Her2 positive and will now have chemo for 6 months, herceptin for 12 months and then start on tamoxifin for at least 5 years.  if anyone else is familiar with this diagnosis I would be grateful for input xx",
