    "Content": "Hello, I was awaiting for my surgery mastectomy, and just a few days before I was due to go into hospital my partner dumped me.  Every appointment up to my surgery he went with me, supportive till then he was.  I had to go through the whole entire operation on my own.  I never felt so upset or alone in all my life. Not even my family members came to visit me whilst I was in hospital.  My surgery had complications, and I was kept in longer.  I only really packed enough knickers to last me just over a week.  No family came in, I had to get a nurse to wheel me down into the shops of the hospital and buy some extra underwear.  In the end, I was having to secretly wash them in the shower when I had one. Two days after my surgery I had a text message off my partner saying he hoped the surgery went well.    I feel for you.  It's not been a week yet since I got out of hospital, and I'm still alone. Regards Sandie",
