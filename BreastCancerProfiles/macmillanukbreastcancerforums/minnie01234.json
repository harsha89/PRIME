    "Content": "Hi Sue I had my surgery June 15th this year, i had Double Mastectomy and recon using back muscle. I was concerned about the recovery time same as you and i have to admit it hasn't been as bad as i thought. I stayed in hospital 7 days after my surgery and it took a good 4 to 6 weeks to get back in the swing of things. Do check with ur car insurance as there can be restrictions but i did try small driving trips after 4 weeks then by 6 weeks i was driving myself round as before. Like you i am mainly on my own (but with kids) so hav had to pick myself up and just get on with it. My full movement in my arms is improving with physio and i almost hav full movement back both sides. I am not ready to go back to work yet and i do find that long days and busy days do tire me out big time. I feel really good and i really like the look of my 'New Boobs' Its early days but getting there. Hope this helps Take Care Min",
