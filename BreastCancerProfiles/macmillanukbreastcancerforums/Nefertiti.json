      "Content": "iwannaliveforever Hi I've been avoiding this site because sometimes it makes me worry more (although sometimes you say just the right thing ) Anyway, I hope everyone's doing okay, or finding a way to get through this horrible experience. I am now on Tamoxifen (after lumpectomy, chemo and radio) and being cut adrift by the medical professionals. As I try to get back to normal, I am reconsidering all the lifestyle choices I made before and trying to behave better, so I am taking more exercise, juicing when I have time, moisturising night and morning, etc.) To be honest I wasn't very unhealthy before so there aren't any obvious radical adjustments except... I have always loved beauty products (creams and cleansers, gels and scrubs, hair dye, more than actual make-up. I started looking for a natural hair dye to use when I take off my wig (currently I'm 16 weeks since last chemo, hair is about 2.5cm on average, but quite sparse) and what I read has freaked me out - parabens can promote oestrogen production, apparently and there are all sorts of other nasties such as SLS in everyday products.  So my question is, which brands (not just hair dye, but shower gel, facial cleanser, moisturiser and serum, etc) are considered safe? I'm coming to the UK (from France) at Xmas and am prepared to go a little crazy in Boots if I'm sure the products aren't harmful. If I look at my life before cancer the one thing I never considered was the list of ingredients on cosmetics, so (2 + 2 = 100 ) that's what I'm most frightened of. Any tips? As I say, it's Christmas so I'm ready to spoil myself. Thanks and love LIzz xxxxx",
