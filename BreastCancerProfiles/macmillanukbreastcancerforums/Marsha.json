I'm afraid although I can see the lump, I can't enlighten you as to what it might be. Nice tattoo by the way.",

Treatment has come on such a long way with breast cancer, and you're being treated in a really good place. Take each day as it comes, if you're feeling good, then feel good and don't feel guilty, if you're feeling bad, it's ok, you have every right to. If you feel scared and don't want to burden your family with those feelings, come here.. we all know what you're going through and we can help you rationalise your feelings and fears.",
