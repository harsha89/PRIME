    "Content": "Went to Doctor 2 weeks ago about some really trivial stuff that needed sorting and while there mentioned an itch I had been having on and off for a little while in my left breast..... at the time I didn't have the itch but the Doc gave me an examination (and found a spot that really stung and has done ever since) and located what she thought was a thickening and referred me to the Brest Clinic. Fast forward 2 weeks, have been to the clinic today saw Consultant who did a physical exam and an ultra sound and found the thickening but said he wasn't too worried about it but would want to keep and eye on it and would recall me in about 3 months?  He then sent me for mammogram and I was sent home.  While in there I asked about the itch and the strange \"Picking\" sensation that I have been experiencing since Doctors examination.... he didn't seem at all concerned but I am still getting the weird sensation through the breast??  Have to ask am I imagining it as have been totally stressed out..... While part of me is relieved a part of me is totally confused.....  what was the itch?",
