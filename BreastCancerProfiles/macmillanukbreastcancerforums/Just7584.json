      "Content": "Thank you on the hair everyone. I will be getting it shaved off im just thinking can I get away with it for few more days or are clumps going to fall out.  On the tingly hand thing. Its only when I apply pressure to them if washing them. I've been off the steroids for days now. I'm also taking anti- depressants so maybe its them. Back in for chemo 2 next week so I will just make sure I tell them.  Hope everyone is OK xxxxx",

This is when I wash them or put moisturiser on them. I'm trying to narrow this down to what could be the cause as I'm also on other medication. Thank you! ",

Know its going to happen but would like to hang on it to it for the bank holiday weekend. Any ideas once it starts going how quickly it comes out- know we are all different. I'm on day 15 of First FEC. Next one is next Thursday. Lots of love everyone. Justine xxx",
