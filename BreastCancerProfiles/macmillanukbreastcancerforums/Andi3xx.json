      "Content": "Hi I had my pre assessment today ready for my 1st FEC treatment on Friday. The nurse advised me to have a PICC line put in because one of the drugs is harsh on your veins.  I read the booklet when I got home and just wanted to ask if anyone on here had or has one fitted and what it's like.   Thank you",

      "Content": "Hi puzzler I had the PICC removed on 8th July, 1 week after having it put in. The pain got too much. Anyway, the following Tuesday I had the worst pain on my left side under my ribs and after 2 trips to A & E, was diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs, they sent me home with painkillers and injections to thin my blood. The following morning the pain was much worse and I couldn't get my breath at all, mum rang 999 and I was taken back to hospital. I was so scared when they told me I had extensive clots on both lungs and pneumonia and should have never been sent home the previous day.  I have been discharged today, the infection has cleared after IV antibiotics and I have to inject blood thinners for 6 months. I thought I was smashing this, it has just proven me wrong.  Just wonder how much of me is going to be left after all the battering...",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I had a PICC line put in just before my 3rd cycle of FEC last week.  The hospital did attempt to put one in before my 2nd cycle but unfortunately, the damage to my veins was already taking a hold and I had to ask my consultant if I could have the PICC on my surgery side.  He said this was fine because I had only had one lymph node removed. Anyway, since having the PICC, I have been in constant pain under my arm, across my chest and up the side of my neck.  I rang the hospital to discuss it with them and they said it was just my veins getting used to the line and to put heat on the area.  So, I took their advice but no matter what I do, the pain is still there and I have very limited mobility in my arm. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  I dont know if its because the PICC is on the same side as my surgery or if the pain will just ease in time like the hospital said.  All I know is that I can't take much more of the pain, I would rather have the thing taken out but then I still have 3 more lots of FEC to go. Take Care All",
