    "Content": "Hello Sophie,  I cannot express to  you how much the LGFG course did for me. I was a busy confident woman and never wore make up or bothered much with my hair. when I lost my hair, lashes and eyebrows I felt like I was disappearing. The course taught me how to make me look normal again. for the first time I learned to put on eyeliner and use brow pencils. It gave me the confidence to go to my charity's annual ball. It was also good to meet other women outside of a medical setting. i hope this helps.",
