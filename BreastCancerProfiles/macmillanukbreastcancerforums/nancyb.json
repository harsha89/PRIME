      "Content": "Hi my name is Nancy! I'm 54 and I've reached the stage where there are no more treatments available to me. I have a fungating tumour on my shoulder, which is very visible to the eye and I have to have my wound dressed every day as it is weeping a lot of exudate. I have no confidence in going out as I am finding it difficult to disguise the tumour, I also have a small tumour on my neck. I was just wondering if there was anybody out there in a similar situation, as I haven't met anyone who understands what I'm going through. Would just like to be able to compare notes and get some possible advice because I'm finding that some of the nurses don't seem to appreciate how distressing this is for me and sometimes leave me bandaged up like an American footballer! Any advice or support offered would be appreciated nancy x",
