      "Content": "I had FEC-T which finished February 2016. I had endured awful joint pain during chemo but it continued after it had finished. 6 weeks after the end of chemo my GP offered me an X-ray which he called me to advise I now had moderate osteoarthritis in both hips and severe osteoarthritis in left knee and 'spiky bits' on shin. I was told to use crutches which I had been given the previous week by physiotherapists at hospital when I went in for my double mastectomy. What I can say is that 3 weeks after my mastectomy I started swimming (May 2016) this has helped enormously with my pain in leg joints/hips. I go 3-4 times per week swimming 24-30 lengths of 25 metres pool. Highly recommend swimming!!! I hope you can find relief xx",

This started when I was on docetaxel chemotherapy - I had 3 cycles starting on 19th October 2015, I am due to have my final cycle of EC this Thursday (first FEC gave me heart failure so F removed from subsequent cycles) Today I went out with my mum and really struggled with walking and standing still is agony in my hips and lower back...like you another day might not be too bad. I have been told that once all my chemo is finished and it starts to go out my system it should improve - I have enrolled for a chemo fitness 6 week program in the hope it will get me moving and have bought a cycle you do sitting in a chair and can place on stable and use for your arms - yet to get started Haven't had any tests etc so pinning everything on it being chemotherapy related st present",

      "Content": "I sympathise with you and the worry you are going through. I was diagnosed with triple negative / invasive ductal cancer in August 2015, had lumpectomy (top outer quadrant of right breast) and sentinel node biopsy 10th September and healed well.  Start of October I noticed sudden onset of thick orange peel skin on lower half of breast, inverted nipple, red hot skin on one side. This was ultra sounded on 2 occasions and found to be 8 MM. Thick. My breast surgeon both times gave diagnosis of oedema caused by the surgery.  As my chemo is going to be finishing end of next month and I will then be due to go into radiotherapy I have had discussions with oncologist who is concerned about the effects of radiotherapy on oedema on a large breast.  This was discussed at multi disciplinary team meeting and the outcome was that as this 'oedema' has been there for 3months and hasn't altered it should be further investigated to rule out any inflammatory cancer. Biopsies taken last Wednesday and I get results next week (20th) ive been on chemo for the whole time this has been present and even if this did turn out to be IBC chemo would be the first treatment so I'm not concerned.... Just be good to have a definitive answer. ",

      "Content": "Dog Ear revision surgery under local anaesthetic  Update. Went in for day surgery last Thursday feeling really calm and looking forward to the outcome.  Met with surgeon on arrival who marked me up and on further inspection decided he would revise the whole mastectomy scar line, extending it to deal with side bulge. As I had residual tissue in the right breast he also removed that resulting in my right breast now matching the flatness of my left. Local anaesthetic was given throughout the marked scar line and operation was commenced with a privacy screen put up so I couldn't see the operation... but sadly I felt it!...had to call out several times due to the pain experienced and more local was added each time but it was the most difficult experience I have had. A kg of flesh was removed during the operation. I was closed with 60-70 staples.  Saw the surgeon the next day and we are still friends! But I have advised that I couldn't consider doing the left breast in the same manner and will need general anaesthetic.  I do have to say I am really pleased with the result so far, looking forward to having staples out, very bruised at present. ",

From have a b cup spare boob under my armpit which made it difficult to put my arm down or sleep on that side I now have a lovely flat look but with enough flesh to allow for movement.  So after a meeting with breast surgeon to discuss having the left side done to match I was relieved the first thing he said was \"neither of us want a repeat of last time\", we talked and he advised that this time I would have local & sedation with canula in and anaesthetist monitoring throughout \"just in case\"... this worked out so much better!!! this time he didn't put a drain in as he hadn't taken as much flesh out but on Saturday 10 days after i 'sprung a leak! Bloody water from a seroma oozed out through staple no3 hole!! 3 clean bras and tops in an hour! Finally got some thick pads from chemist and after 2 hours the dripping stopped... and the pressure behind the scar line eased.  Got a bit of a square cornered boob which on wound check day 6 he said he would trim in clinic with some local - I did say I didn't want to be sponge bob squareboob!!! would I recommend dog ear revision- absolutel!! I felt really uncomfortable with the dog ear bumpers and now feel normal",

(Though no dancing just a spectator) lots of tightness and pulling which will need a bit of time. Back at surgeon tomorrow for wound check and to get histology report on flesh taken out and confirmation as to whether I had a neuroma which may have caused the pain in the operation which wasn't expected. ",

It is really uncomfortable generally as I cannot bring my arms down straight without squashing it which is uncomfortable/painful. I also am a side sleeper but this is impossible without using my v shaped pillow to lift me and let bulge sit between v otherwise you are squashing it with body weight.  It was also noted that it was causing interrupted sleep as it would wake me up if I did lean on it... and they put in the letter to finance about the effects of lack of sleep when I am still recovering from big surgery.  I hit the swimming pool 3 weeks after my mastectomy going on average 3-4 times per week and swimming 2 miles per week, using breaststroke I have really exercised my upper body and I got rid of the fat bulge that started in my back and came round so the bulge under the arm is now not down to excess fat but left over breast tissue which would have been pulled forward if I still had breasts.  Does that help?

Which get in the way and prevent me sleeping on my side.  I was told due to the triple neg status and family history ( mum died aged 33 of recurring breast cancer - brain tumour/lung cancer) I would be offered 3 monthly check ups i was seen by breast care nurse who simply asked me how I felt , checked my scar line then booked me in for 6 months! I was asked if there was anything else and I mentioned the dogears which the surgeo had said the morning after surgery he could revise and I was advised after she went to speak to him (he never came to see me) that he was happy to do it BUT that surgery isn't automatically funded anymore and will have to go to panel for approval.  Do speak up and let them know any concerns you have, I was quite awkward as I explained that I wasn't really feeling reassured as the examination on the scar only highlighted that I didn't know what was normal for me anymore so how am I going to identify what is different!! i am seeing a McMillan counsellor which is great and I would recommend this if you can good luck xx",

I had a belated 50th birthday/\"I kicked cancers butt party\" end of July and celebrated with 50 great friends and family who have been supportive and this Saturday hubby and I are off on our first ever cruise - can't wait :) I am being very positive, having fun with friends and family, working with dietitian to lose weight (long way to go), swimming to improve fitness and doing all I can to get in as good a shape as a can to prevent reoccurrence... it was just hard to have a follow up which as in your words seemed a bit of a waste of time, and came at the anniversary of the cancer being diagnosed and losing my mum - guess these things catch you unawares sometimes. but I've moved on, accepted that is what it is, and .... ive got a cruise to pack for... life ain't too bad is it, lol Bedford69",

The bras I am wearing are fab!!! The link is attached www.ambrosewilson.com/.../show.action Just ordered myself another set! They are so comfortable and will accommodate from an A-Ccup with the stretch and bargain price After the op when I had dressings on it was nice to put this bra on and just feel a little bit more secure Swimming - I was far from fit!! I self referred to dietitian when I went for my lumpectomy last September, wasn't allowed to lose throughout my chemo but now just starting my weight loss regime which is going to be as big a battle as the cancer!! Almost half my body weight to lose.  There is something really therapeutic about swimming though. I seem to go through so many thoughts whilst I'm in the pool and plan things and come out feeling good about myself for having done it. The chemo has given me osteoarthritis in both hips and knee so walking is painful and again the non weightbearing in the water is bliss - and after months of insomnia I have just had 2 full nights of uninterrupted sleep!",

Due to high BMI it was planned I would have two surgeons performing surgery to keep the theatre/anaesthesia time down to 2.5 - 3hrs but ended up with just my breast cancer surgeon doing it and a 6hr surgery. All went well.  One drain in each breast but the right breast drain had to be removed day 2 as the tube had begun to migrate out of the body, it was still draining 150ml per day so that formed in breast as a seroma. Seroma manually drained by surgeon removing a couple of staples and massaging breast and relieving the fluid on day 6 but it filled up again and when they tried again on Friday 29th (day 10) using needle to aspirate it was too thick...leaving breast care nurse no option but to leave it.  Discussed at multi disciplinary team meeting Friday afternoon where they were discussing the results of histology from mastectomy samples and my pathway for follow up treatment plan. Got a call to come in and meet with consultant Tuesday morning",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda sounds very familiar, I went through T-FEC 6 sessions Oct 2015-Feb2017 i found I had the incredible joint pain which start 36hrs after infusion and lasted 3-5 days before easing off. I have to say that for me recovery from these side effects was less each cycle but tramadol helped! On the 3rd cycle my oncologist prescribed me oromorph for those few really difficult days.  Just keep in mind it's doing its job and for a positive outcome and I hope you get through this period as painfree as possible xxx have a good Christmas x",

Full-time and more as I used to take students out in the evening to improve social skills... absolutely loved it but knew that physically I couldn't keep up with the role and was fortunate that my son who runs his own business offered me a job working part-time in the office in my garden just in the mornings- this is perfect as on good days I swim in the afternoon and bad days I sleep! hard to get this through to assessor that I love what I do now... but I loved my full time job before and if it wasn't for the chemotherapy I would be back there doing it",

      "Content": "hi Dayityrose i would like to chat with you in regards to your underactive thyroid and arthritis in knee.  I was diagnosed with underactive thyroid in Dec 2013 Aug 2015 0 diagnosed with breast cancer - lumpectomy, T-FEC chemotherapy and double mastectomy. April 2016 - diagnosed with moderate osteoarthritis in both hips and severe in left knee and spiky bits on my tibia.

They cant keep my thyroid in the 'normal' range so it has been upped and upped and now on 200mg daily. what is your experience?  sorry for going off at a tangent from original thread of messages Bedford69",
