    "Content": "Hi there, Firstly sorry that you have had so much cancer crap though the family! I had a left mastectomy in 2010 and due for my right one on 5th April (cancer came back for another fight) I must say that in my experience its a lot of will power and mind over matter, the greatest thing about cancer is that feeling that makes you change your whole perspective on yourself and the world in general.  I was up and walking the same day as my surgery, I started working my arm as much I can (using the motion as you would to brush your hair) the nurses were very impressed that I did things, pushed myself but of course not too much, you dont want to hurt yourself but you know your body better than anyone else, use that knowledge I think driving takes at least 2 weeks, until you can use your arm properly and in fact another good exercise is to just sit in your car and work the gear lever - obviously the easier it gets the closer you get to driving again. My drain was in for about 2 weeks if I can remember correctly, again this is all about how your body copes, the level of 'muck' coming out has to get less and less each day and only when its at correct level and doctor is happy will it be removed, I found with my drain that if I wore little 'workout' vest that could hold the drain and a lose fitting top you can go about in public and not scare people hahaha  Good luck with it all and as I say, mind over matter and use that inner power xx",
