      "Content": "Thank you both. I have been to the doctor. She can see what I mean about it slanting inwards. She examined me and says I am really lumpy so it is hard to make anything specific out. I have to wait until 7 days after my next period finishes and go back to be checked again, and possibly go for an ultrasound. Bearing in mind my family history it is impossible not to be imagining the worst.    ",

      "Content": "Hi I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but I can't help but panic in the meantime and am just trying desperately to find as much information as I can. I wondered if anyone here might have had relevant experience. One of my nipples/areola has gone a bit flat. It's not a major change but it is a change. I am trying to find alternative causes other than cancer but I can't find anything. I don't have any other symptoms and can't feel a lump. I am 33, and under the care of the genetics clinic as I am considered high risk because of my family history of breast and ovarian cancer (which includes inflammatory breast cancer). I know that the only way to find out is go to the doctor, and I have my appointment tomorrow. But I am scared because if, for example, someone finds a lump, there are all sorts of benign reasons that could cause it. I can't find anything so reassuring for nipple change :(  Has anyone had this and it turned out to be nothing? Thank you  ",
