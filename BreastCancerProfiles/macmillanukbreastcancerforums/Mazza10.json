The district nurse who comes to give my Herceptin injections was so concerned she made an appointment for me to see onc on the 6th Dec as I want to give it up.Have already told them am not having the zoladronic acid so will try and find out what the percentage for me is.... as said before would rather have quality of life. Starting rads on 8th Dec and apart from the further Herceptin injections that is it for me. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, sorry for jumping in on your thread but something jowoomot said hit a chord with me. It was the word recognition. It's what I think I was looking for but didn't know until I read this. At the time of treatment I really didn't want it, all the 'you're brave, be strong' stuff really got on my nerves, but now all the treatments have finished it's like everyone has brushed it to one side as if it never happened. Sometimes I don't want people to know I've had cancer (especially strangers) other times, especially when I see or hear people doing something petty, I want to shout at them 'get a life' it's too short. I don't want people to fawn over me but I want them to recognise I'm never going to be the old me... a brush with death changes things. As for the 'filters' I've never had them! All my life I've said what I think (got me in trouble at times lol). Now I've got extra with the old age non-filter so I'm twice as lethal. Good luck to you all, be selfish you earned it. xx",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I am not new on here but I removed myself from the site because I went into a dark place. Sounds silly but it was after I had been told that I had a 'complete pathological response' ( no sign of tumour after chemo) and no trace of anything to remove in my lumpectomy.I still have radiotherapy to go (8th Dec for 15 sessions) and 3 weekly Herceptin injections for a year.I have refused letrozole and any biophosphonates. So why then did I suddenly start crying and having panic attacks? My family (bless them) said I should be celebrating now I am cured and back to normal....well we all know what we think of that! I couldn't stay in my house,I couldn't be with people but then I needed people but who needs someone who cries at a smile or kindness. I was so bad one day I went back to the hospital and sat outside the Macmillan office crying.They sent for my BCN who arrived with a clinical psychologist. I didn't care I just wanted the crying and panic attacks to stop.She actually told me it was normal! Then told me they were very good at treating cancer but were useless afterwards, but research had been done and a new after-care service had started and I was an ideal candidate.They phoned my gp and got him to prescribe anti-depressants and also diazepam for 2 weeks. I have had 3 sessions with her so far and believe me I never knew what things I had been brooding on (some stupid things too).She said I had been putting on a 'good' face' even the BCN said I was the last person she thought she would see like this as I had been so strong even when really ill with sepsis etc. I have stopped the diazepam now but it did help me to sleep and the anti depressants seem to have kicked in..plus I had a good talk to the family and finally told them how I felt. I need to get out more but my 'friends' seem to have all emigrated.Before all this I booked a holiday for between op and rads...guess who with.....Monarch... who went bust but at least I got my money back lol. Sorry for the essay but just think that more needs to be said and done about our mental health too. Love to you all xx",

Diagnosed in May I have had 3 Fec so far and having 4 Herceptin/perjeta/docetaxol first one on the 11th august.Then surgery and rads. My oncologist told me there would be at least a 4 week break after chemo before surgery to get some strength back. I do have a date for surgery(providing everything goes to plan) 15th November so I am hoping to get a weekend away (uk) before then, but I am not booking anything as we all know how things can change, I am just taking it day by day and if I can't get away now will do it next year. It's my 65th birthday on 10th august (yes day before chemo) and not doing anything party wise as when the treatment is all over we are going to have one whale of a time! Keep on being strong for your sister but look after yourself too. xx",

I won't say to normal as I've forgotten what normal is! I do feel so much better and the psycho has definitely helped... the funny thing is I was never afraid to speak my mind before diagnosis,especially to family and then I became a mouse, too fatigued to care but obviously keeping all the anger and annoyance in.. she told me don't do it..tell them straight away how you feel and now I do. Or let it go in one ear and out the other and think of myself. I am now a little stronger, bit more selfish, but number one is now first in my book. Take care all and do read the blog. xx",

I just wanted to let all the new or old people on here know that it does get better. I suddenly even today ,months after treatment has finished realised I've won the battle for now.. I was walking down the road today and suddenly thought I've beaten you now you breast cancer bastard..where that came from. .no idea. .but it felt good. I have been in touch with my MP to see what we can do for the future..as was said to me 'we are so good at treating cancer but not good at the after effects'. I just hope I can give a little assurance to all the new people on this rollercoaster that it does slow down and get better. Love to you all. xx",

I have phoned the passport office and after consulting with someone as she didn't know the answer she came back with ....'the Passport Office mainly use facial recognition technology so you can either wear a wig or be bald (unless your facial features have changed). However, other countries may look at the photo,see the hair(wig) and may query it if you are bald. So our advice would be,even if you don't wear it after the photo,to take the same wig with you to prevent any difficulty.' She said she had never had anyone ask this before so it can't be a problem as such. Thanks again for your help. xx",

I went for a sleep each day when I got home, all my appointments were at the same time in the morning,ask your rads dept if they can do that for you.I found it better as I knew where I was and how the day spanned out.

I got a beautiful bunch of pink lilies and half are not even open yet. 2 days off now and they're going to tag my missed day on the end so 30th Dec finish now hopefully.

So far everything has been fine but she said it looked a little red around my scar so they gave me a dressing which you just splash a little water on and place over the spot that's sore... it doesn't feel sore but I've put it on anyway... it doesn't stick down your bra just holds it in place unless like me your scar goes up your armpit lol.It's reusable for 7 days you just re-hydrate it when it needs.Marvellous. It annoyed me after 10 mins so off it came and back to the cream which has worked well so far.You can't put cream on when using it - well after 13 zaps and only 2 to go I'm not giving up my cream...so there! Everyone I've got to know at the sessions all finish tomorrow so there will be a lot of bell ringing!

So when I asked what was going on a lovely nurse said after FEC treatment is finished you ring the bell and tell cancer to Fec Off. I really laughed,but when I finished couldn't bring myself to do it as it seemed like tempting fate. I'm at a different hospital for my rads and the bell is right next to the reception..so maybe it's an American thing starting hereÂ  don't know or it might have been going for years. I'm the same as you since chemo started I don't have any sweat and don't use anything and honestly I don't think I smell lol. So far the cream I said they gave me seems to be working I slap it on as soon as I get home and shove an old t-shirt on so not ruining clothes-then more just before bed and once a week I use Udderly Cream as a complete body moisturiser... I was never a daily person I always forget. Just cancelled my 30th Dec appt and made it for 2nd Jan now . After getting zapped today went to see my grand-daughter as she's 2 year old today. I bought her a dolls pram and doll and made the mistake of saying lets take all the dollys for a walk (meaning pushing round the house)Nooooo the coat and wellies came out and ended up taking her to the park..but made my day it was lovely.

Good tip too about putting it on a month after as no-one has mentioned this.Been ok so far .When I was showering this morning my nipple was sore underneath and I could feel a lump ...panic mode started...My tumour was in my armpit so first thought was have they missed this because of concentrating on the armpit. Told them at the zap session and they said it was just scar tissue forming from my ops and the rads hardening it... nothing to worry about! Will see how it goes and contact bcn if get too worried.

I was worried about missing a session but she said they don't like you to but they will squeeze me an extra one in either Saturday or just add one at the end. So stayed in bed all day in fact only got up at 4pm...then they called and said could I come in at 7pm as they had a cancellation. No way could I go but she said no problem so still going in tomorrow. It's not having the cold so much it's just I can't hold my breath as my chest is so tight. Nothing is straightforward for me lol. xx Oh and nearly all my fingernails have now come off..can't even push a tablet out the packet I have to cut them out! PN doesn't help.

I read the radiotherapy tips forum on here and saw all the different suggestions but the query I have is do I put cream on BEFORE rads or just after? Thanks for any help xx",

      "Content": "Hi All, Had my first rads this morning. I just showered and used nothing.My appointment was 11.15am and I was out after about 20 mins,she said the first one was a bit longer as they were doing some measurements and the next lot should only be about 5 mins! I was given a gown (well just to waist) like a tabard, zips down front and Velcro on sleeves so you just undo which boob you're having done, which I keep for all my sessions so it's my own personal one. I was given a large tub of Aquamax which she said I can use before rads as it's the only one doesn't affect results,just a thin coat before then after slather it on at least twice but only use on treatment not as a general moisturiser. I said I had got pure aloe vera and she said use it anywhere else if you have dry skin but not on treatment site?? She also said the rads would kick in after about a week (skin wise) but if the Aquamax doesn't work they have other stuff, but most people don't have a problem and they thinks it's the best. I never mentioned R1 or 2 as I thought I'd save that for if there is a problem.Have to say they were lovely and helpful. We will see how it goes and I'll let you know. xx",

      "Content": "Hello Zelda, I'm afraid I am not as patient and understanding as a lot of people on this site(which you did say in your post on the room you were leaving?) but I have watched and read your posts for a long time now and I honestly believe that you need help of a psychiatric nature. Gragon and others have spoken so kindly and patiently to you but I get the strong impression that you do not want to help yourself at all and before anyone jumps in and condemns me I suggest you read all of Zelda's posts. You jump from forum to forum with the same thing and I know I don't have to read it but at first I was very concerned and worried for you but some of the things you have said about your son are despicable even if he has schizophrenia and I believe you continue because no one stands up to you for fear of looking bad, but I don't think like that. Yes your problems seem to be bad but only you can do anything about them and I am in no way referring here to your cancer diagnosis but to your general outlook on life. It is obvious you are an intelligent woman and you may have a mental health problem which I know you can get lots of help for. I have been in some dark places in my time but never have I seen anyone as bad as you...everything seems to be the 'worst case scenario'. I really do hope you seek some help and get some more trust in doctors and those trying to help you. Yes we are all free to rant on here but I hope we listen to what others say to us, maybe not now but in the future, you have had some excellent advice from better people than me and I do feel for you, what worries me is that you are talking at times suicidal and that I find very concerning. I know you don't like hugs so I will just send you my best regards and hope you find what you are looking for someday.",

We are all so different it's unbelievable. When they first said I had to do them myself I was like oh nooo I can't, but it was a long wait for a nurse to come. The first day I stood with injection in hand, no I can't, oh get on with it! and I jabbed it in. Felt no pain and felt like a wuzz for worrying. One thing they did tell me was when you take them out of fridge(they are stored there) warm them up in room temperatureÂ  for 20 mins before injecting. Even when I get my Herceptin injection they give it to me to warm up in my hands first. Hopefully you'll be the same. Good luck. xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Excuse me while I rant a little. Tomorrow have an apt with the onc , results of bone and heart scans, as some of you know I have had chemo/surgery/rads/Herceptin injections but when she put me on letrozole I had a severe skin reaction (still have scarred hands) so before I had my rads on 8th Dec she gave me a 'drug holiday' as she put it. Well I am going to tell her tomorrow that,apart from Herceptin injections) I want no more drugs. Drugs that thin my bones,drugs that counteract those drugs but cause jaw necrosis. No I want a bit of quality in my later years. For the first time in months I feel a little like the 'old' me. I have done hours of research, mainly on NICE and feel for me this is the best option but I know she will fight tooth and nail for me to continue, she said I could try anastrazole and skip the biophosphonates... what is the point then? Anger because apart from my first chemo I have gone through all the treatment alone. I just phoned my son and asked if he would come with me tomorrow as last time my dil accused me of being negative when I told her they had found microscopic nodules in my lungs said I exaggerated things for the worse. So I said if he came he could hear first hand all the results,prognosis etc (they know I am refusing AI). He can't come because dil can't look after 2yr old and baby on her own yet! For an hour! But she went out with both to her friends this afternoon.I am so angry I could burst. I was told to come round to theirs after apt and tell them all about it.Well God help anyone who say's the wrong thing this time! As always thanks for listening. xx",

So now sod it .... I'm just going to get on with it as usual.Keep that dignified silence and when I get home tomorrow going to book a little holiday in the sun and spend the inheritance!

As I was going and putting my coat on she said what's wrong with your arm..been sore for about 10 days.. orders a bone scan straight away..omg says me.. not a secondary... she says probably not but we'll do a bone scan just to check but unfortunately there's a backlog so no scan till 28 Feb.. so scanxiety now. I went HOME straight after as was crackered by then anyway ..3 hours after I said I would be at sons he phoned to ask where was I and what was the results!! I said if you'd come you would have known but then I did my usual...everythings fine...said about arm and scan and heard dil in background say oh that's good news could I have 2 yr old for a couple of hours tomorrow. As I love my grand-daughter I said yes obviously but I realise how selfish they are now.It's when it suits them.. I hate to say it because I know they love me but they are so thoughtless. Anyway, was so knackered after lack of sleep last night..fell asleep in chair from 4pm until 7pm and then been looking at holidays then fell asleep again!! So that's me for the night! Thank you all for your love and concern it's more appreciated than you will ever know. xx PS.... referring me to a dermatologist for the scarring on my hands from letrozole reaction...also said rads side effects come out about 4-6 weeks after finishing that's why I suddenly feel tired....not the lack of sleep then??",

Even as I took my hair down it was so sore I just held it while he chopped with scissors and almost instantly the pain eased. My scalp was too tender so he did a No 2 shave and then today it was painfree so got the No 1 which has left a small fuzz covering. I am actually amazed how much it suits me! Went shopping today but wore a hat and wrap but think I will go without next time as I found people looking and I felt a little like a 'victim' as my family said people who know you know its you and sod everyone else! Plus side it was nice to get up this morning and not have to faff about blow-drying my hair! Also noticed my pubic hair has gone too-must have gone in shower this morning and I hardly noticed lol. Got my 2nd cycle on Friday and a bit apprehensive that things get worse but I am always a 'half full glass' person. No doubt I will be back here as reading the posts is so inspiring and helpful.",

I am a newbie though and have my second cycle on Friday 30th so who knows how I will feel after..... as brave as I sound I am scared....

      "Content": "Last year a work colleague lost her sister to BC. She did the campaign then and I was one of the people who sponsored her and I did think she was 'brave' doing it but only in respect that it was something I could never do personally.I never once thought of the people with cancer going through chemo just that we were raising money for macmillan research, which I believe is hugely important. If truth was told we also had a morbid curiosity to see what she looked like bald (sorry). I thought you get cancer, have chemo, go bald, throw up and then you are cured. How wrong was I. A year later I have breast cancer and am the bald person and I would never want anyone to shave their hair on my behalf.I would rather an advert that raised all the side effects of chemo and help the money go to researching new chemo with less effects. I was utterly ignorant of the things people had to go through, I didn't even know you lost all body hair, let alone the nail problems,neuropathy etc etc. So surely raising more awareness in this respect is needed. I understand people wish to raise money in their own way but this campaign does trivialise what we go through and obviously macmillan have not learnt how people feel from last year.Â  If anyone asks me if I have 'braved the shave' I am going to strip naked and say yes everywhere! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Phaedra, I refused to take them and any AI for similar reasons as you've put.That was after all my treatment finished and I started to feel 'human' again, if I was younger I might have taken a different path. My onc tried to persuade me to take them but when I asked her for the % benefit she had to admit it was minimal. I just didn't like the idea of taking tablets that thin my bones and then more to try and sort them out after with the risk of jaw necrosis. I wanted some quality to my life. I've had 2 bone scans since refusing and so far both show just very slight osteoporosis at the base of my spine which they say is an age thing anyway and is exactly the same as the scan I had prior to treatment starting. I have an apt to see onc on Wednesday so will let you know what the onc says but any decision you make is yours and you must be happy and comfortable with it. I am with mine including the chance of recurrence which she actually told me was not an exact science anyway. I did a lot of research before I came to my decision too. We are all different and I hope you choose whats best for you. Good luck. xx",

I don't think it's the picc line as such I am afraid of it's the local anaesthetic. After my core biopsy and sentinel biopsy I had a severe reaction to the 'local'..... it was awful, as if acid had been poured inside me.I spent about 3 hours in the recovery room being given every painkiller going... it took about 4 hours before the pain went. I have been trying to find out since what they used so I can avoid it,but no one will tell me. I will be asking further when I go on Friday.It's a different hospital to go to for the picc line and they said it was an injection so that was a no straight away.Â  Will see if my veins behave!

In fact it was the amount of detail she gave that actually made me change my mind and take the hormonal therapy treatment.

Won't go into details as its all in August chemo thread, but after 3Fec (which were ok) and 1 Docetaxol (which sent me to hospital) my onc has switched me to weekly paxlitaxel for 8 weeks (apparently equivalent to the 3 more docetaxol I would have had).So I had my first one today,but didn't realise with having the Herceptin and perjeta (still every 3 weeks) it would take 5 hours,so by the time I got home at 4.30pm I was cream crackered.Thought I'll have a little granny nap and woke up at half past midnight - hence wide awake now. Still at least no steroids or filgristim needed on the weekly dose.Pain going weekly but if it avoids all the SE it's worth it. Only time will tell - will keep you informed and good luck to the ladies trying cold cap I was too much of a wimp!

I told the nurse I had already decided to ask to stop chemo as I don't want to end up with numb hands and feet and this is getting worse not better.Quality of life is very important to me, it does help to know that my tumour has shrunk so hopefully they will go straight for the lumpectomy now.

I have never laughed so much... she is the joy of my life. So glad I had the chance because how quickly things can change in this game! Went for cycle on 15th and no chemo again.. onc said we might have to stop but she is on holiday next week so to have that one then we will review when she gets back. On the 17th rushed into hospital with chest pains and,cut a long story short, have a blood clot on my lung.Given blood thinners and scans to confirm but no chemo again this week(22nd) so that's 3 missed now and I still have the neuropathy! So I definitely think I will be leaving the chemo club. I don't know what's happening to me but I haven't stopped crying since I came out of hospital on Thursday afternoon.Had a panic attack yesterday afternoon too,haven't had one for years. xx",

She did say she would fit me in earlier if she could. I am glad in some ways as I don't want to end up with permanently numb hands and feet, but I feel 'robbed' in other ways that I didn't get to fight the cancer right to the end of chemo, but I gave it my all even when I was really ill.

So cold and just no energy whatsoever.. its an effort to get off the chair but trying not to take to my bed! As for sleep had 2 hours in 24. Was so worn out by last night I took codydramol to knock me out and it did so last night I actually slept and feel so much better today. Yesterday was the lowest, I sat in the garden and sobbed my eyes out... no specific reason just cried.Not usually a moany person but never felt like this before.Didn't want to call my family as I was at theirs on Sunday when I was bad and don't want to keep burdening them... so I felt so alone.

Without meaning to be rude, really bad, can hardly walk,Â like a tree trunk stuck up my bum!! Took some constipation tablets, didn't work, so thought what usually gives me the 'runs' ...eggs. Can't stand them but anything is better than this. 2 boiled eggs for lunch and wow! mount etna (sorry). Thank God I live in a bungalow would never make it upstairs, but the difference it has made! Today I actually feel like a human being. I find this diarrhoea/constipation more debilitating than the actual chemo. Hope not put anyone off eggs lol",

      "Content": "Morning Kerry, 3am this morning I had the same conversation with myself! I can't do this anymore just kept going round and round in my head. Usually I am bad from day 3 onwards, but funnily enough was ok, tempted fate by saying so... then wham yesterday morning woke up with high temp, sore throat and awful diarrhea.Phoned emergency line who told me to call an ambulance straight away. Cut a long story short I ended up on an iv antibiotic, but amazingly my white cell count was high so they sent me home with a further course of antibiotics. Had the worse night so far. Terrible diarrhea,acid reflux and vomiting and as you said just feel awful.Felt sorry for myself and was crying all night.Joined the 'no sleep all night club'.Today is another day and I suppose I will just carry on, don't we all? Keep telling myself it's for the best and it won't last, but it's an awful feeling isn't it. I hope you're feeling a bit better, you're not alone. xx",

I could see my pain in his eyes. He hugged me... I cried even more but feel better for it as I think I've been trying too much to put a brave face on in front of family and this is the reality. Also got me thinking of all the people who have no-one at all, it must be so hard. Just him being here was reassuring and made things less scary.I even said when I am well again I am going to look into volunteering to see and help people who have absolutely no-one. Take care. xx",

      "Content": "Hi to Everyone, Been for my 3rd cycle of FEC this morning.Got told off because I had not phoned triage after my last cycle when I had severe diarrhea for 3 days (I just thought that was the 'norm' but apparently if you go more than 6 times a day you should phone in) I know now and they gave me some tablets to take straight away to control it before it starts. They actually checked with consultant to see if I needed to reduce fec dosage but the 'lady from del monte' said no. I have developed peripheral neuropathy in my hands (they were blue and cold yesterday and tingling like mad) after 4 attempts to put the cannula in they tried a heat pad and another attempt no luck ...I feel like a pin cushion. I apologised for cancelling my picc line appt yesterday (reasons on that thread) again went to consultant and came back with ward sister who said we'll put it in 'bad' arm. I thought they didn't do this but she said it depends on how many nodes have been removed and the fact I only (only! lol) have 4 more fect to have.No need for picc she said we'll do this if needed.Said it was the neuropathy making me more sensitive and sore. It added almost an hour on being there but that's the way the cookie crumbles.At least I got soup and a roll x Feeling ok so far.... know it won't last I seem to be bad days 3-9 so no doubt I'll be back. Keep going everyone. xx",
