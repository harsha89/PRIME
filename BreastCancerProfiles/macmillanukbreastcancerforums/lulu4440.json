      "Content": "Hi everyone, I feel quite exhausted. After 8 cycles of chemo, full mastectomy and lymph node clearance and 15 rounds of radiotherapy I have finally finished the treatment plan laid before me back in March. Now on to the tamoxifen.  The radio therapist congratulated me on getting through the treatment and asked whether I was going to celebrate. I went home and thought about this and couldn't think why I would. I have lost my breast, my lymph nodes, have had chemotherapy running through my body and now radiotherapy. I'm 36 and started the year hoping to start a family and have finished up like this.  Christmas has been so challenging. Everyone close to me is so relieved I've completed this treatment but I'm finding the end of this road so hard emotionally. I'm struggling with the uncertainty. The focus of getting through the treatment has gone and I'm now frightened for the future. How long have I got? Will it spread? When will it return? Last week I desperately wanted the oncologist to say everything will be ok but of course nobody can say that. I'm struggling knowing that there is no full stop to this nightmare. The fear for me and suddenly being spat out of hospital treatment is so overwhelming at times I feel complete panic and completely traumatise by my experience. I'm trying to stay positive and setting a few goals to build up confidence and fitness. Sometimes I feel like its pointless as I have no control as it whether the cancer will come back and spread. I was surprised when the oncologist said we don't really use the word remission anymore all she could say was that they've removed my all the cancer that they were aware of  and I responded to the chemotherapy and now have to go back in 6 weeks.  I keep finding myself bursting into tears at the smallest of things. I went to bird watch by the sea for Christmas, and I cried looking out to sea terrified that I might not see another Christmas.  Has anyone else experienced these feelings of panic and fear when treatment ends? It's strange to think that getting to the end of the treatment has been the goal for nine months and now it's here I feel so down.  Thank you for listening. lucy xx",

      "Content": "Thank you so so much for everyone's advice and replies. It feels so much more doable knowing others relate to how I'm feeling. Really found the dr Peter Harvey article thought provoking too. Really helped. I've been using something called the happy app from the guardian newspaper for a few weeks now. It's helping me to focus on doing something new, uplifting, creative or active each day as it suggests easy manageable daily tasks to help you smile. I have to say it's helping in some small way. Yesterday it suggested a walk by the sea. Today it suggested I do 20 star jumps or dance to my favourite song! So I've done my 20 star jumps! Thank you everyone. Here's to a happy and healthy new year for us all. Love Lucy xxx",

We've decided to move to my beloved Derbyshire in the countryside. Something I've wanted to do for years. I'm through 8 cycles of chemo, a right mastectomy and lymph node clearance. Now onto 15 rounds of radiotherapy. This is helping me to look forward and see a hopeful and happy 2015. Here's hoping everyone. Enjoy your new car. Lucy xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jan, I'm currently working my way through 8 circles of FEC-T I'm 36 with grade 3, stage 2 lymph nodes involved oestrogen positive HER2 neg breast cancer. I've done 4 FEC and now 2 T. Two more to go.... I had quite a time on FEC. I was very nauseous and tired throughout. The T part I have to say so far for me has been more manageable. I haven't suffered with the nausea, only a slight feeling. The symptoms kick in around day 3-4 and are ongoing for me until around day 10. Days one and two after treatment I have been able to sit up, potter around the house, chatting with my sister who makes the trip down to help my husband over the first weekend after treatment. I've been able to snack on foods (unheard of during the first week of the FEC) and have generally been brighter. After the first few days the bone and joint aches seem to kick in, particularly in the nails, ankles and knees joints. I've managed to control this pain with paracetamol, but my oncologist has offered other painkillers if needed. My fingers nails have been painful, again for me controlled through the paracetamol. Its important to keep an eye on your temperature. I've had one incident so far in which my temp went slightly high. As with FEC, the T has caused a sore mouth and a change in my taste buds for a few days. I've found eating a nice fruity ice lolly always helps. The last thing to note is the tiredness. Days 4-10 I've rested whenever I've needed too, accepted help with the household jobs from my friends and family and by day 10 after treatment I'm back cooking, gardening, enjoying food and doing bits of work.  I read lots of different accounts before my first T and was terrified. I suffered no allergy to it and the process of having the drug took just under 2 hours. Everyone is different and will react differently, so hopefully all these side effects which you've come across won't necessarily happen to you. You never know you may find it a little more manageable than the FEC part. Prepare for them, but don't think they're inevitable for you. Good Luck and hope this helps.  Lucy x",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I haven't been on the forum for a while. 3 years ago at the age of 36 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. A large mass at around 6cms, grade 3, stage 2, 1 lymph node with micro involvement. 8 rounds of chemotherapy, a right mastectomy and lymph node clearance, followed by radiotherapy. My treatment ended at Dec 22nd 2014. For anyone going through what seems like a never ending treatment road- you can do it! It can be done!  This all began 3 years ago this week.  I'm currently taking tamoxifen. The first year I took 20mg everyday. The second year I was on and off it due to changing brands and having allergic reactions to certain brands.  Last August I went to the GP with a UTI. I was sent for an ultrasound. A small 2mm functional cyst was found on my right ovary. After some watchful waiting, the cyst cleared and by October had gone. In December I was scanned again and a very small thickening in my womb lining was discovered (ovary clear). After a hysteroscopy, the gynaecologist said there was nothing to worry about, biopsies from womb lining came back clear. My worry is I'm still experiencing period like cramps and the hot flushes are back. My period only came back for a couple of months last year and disappeared again as soon as I started the tamoxifen again. I spoke to my BCN today and she spoke about coming off tamoxifen to see if the cramps die down and if the period comes back. Is this possible after this long? Is period pain a usual symptom? I guess deep down I'm worrying now that I've got ovarian cancer ( although I was scanned and had a blood test for his at the end of last year). What else could be causing these cramps? I'm thinking of calling my GP tomorrow to ask for another scan.  Has anyone had period pain, ovarian cysts or womb lining thickening on tamoxifen?  Be so grateful to hear any experiences.  Thank you so much in advance,  Lucy x",

      "Content": "Hi Comper22, I wanted to offer you some support and reassurance. Your situation mirrors my experience some 11 months ago and I wanted to show you that I'm still standing and starting to come through my experience. Initially my CT scan showed a 5 to 7cm area of concern. Sounds like an alarming situation right? I was terrified. How could this have happened at my age, I was 36 when I was diagnosed. How had I not spotted this earlier? The initial shock was unbearable at times, the fear was overwhelming and then my oncology team started to almost normalise the situation for me (if thats imaginable). I became aware that my oncology team see women like me everyday, that the situation I was in was not my fault, I had just been unlucky. My BCN sat me down and said I was very unlikely to have spotted my tumour earlier as it was sat deep in my breast tissue. Like an iceberg floating in the sea, I could just see and feel the tip. My BCN explained that she had helped and treated many women in my situation and it was very treatable. The size for me became a huge focus in those first few weeks. It must mean the worst?? Size is one factor to take into account in a much more complicated picture as I was to discover. Your prognosis will be based on lots of different factors. Size doesn't tell you the whole picture. Although the area on my scan showed this 5 to 7cm area it did not distinguish between cancerous and pre cancerous areas, whether it was hormone receptive, what stage it was, what its her2 status was. All things that your treatment team will be working on to finding out to help treat your cancer. To cut a long story short, I wanted to tell you that I went through adjuvant chemotherapy last year to initially reduce the cancer. It reduced the area from Around 6cms to 10mm. So a good response. I had a mastectomy and full lymph node clearance on my right side. Out of the 8 lymph nodes taken only the 1 had a speckling of cancer showing. All my other lymph nodes were and had been free of cancer all along. When the cancer was removed, it was classed as early stage breast cancer, stage 2, still very treatable. I have just finished my radiotherapy which was very doable and I'm now looking to starting back at work and enjoying getting back on my bike, swimming and learning to run. My husband and I are tentatively looking at booking our holiday again to Copenhagen which we had to of course cancel last year. I'm feeling that maybe, just maybe I can start to look to my future again. Very slowly, but it's there and I'm sure you will too. I remember at the start of all of this the cancer diagnosis and particularly the fretting of the size of my tumour consumed everything in my life. I couldn't enjoy or think of anything else and I am imagining you are in that place right now. I just wanted to tell you that it does get better, there is a way forward and you can come out the other end. My sister once said to me that she sees this whole thing like a deck of cards on a table...yes the worst case scenario is laid out at the end of the table it's there but we're not picking that pile of cards up yet as we have all these other hands to play yet which have much better odds in us winning. I liked that visualisation. You've now got a treatment team working for you and you've got a good chance of winning and succeeding in this. Take care and hope this has helped a little, Lucy xx",

Tomorrow I go back to the clinic for my outlook and hopefully a treatment plan. I am terrified that this is already a desperate situation. I had no symptoms until I started noticing a thickening in my breast tissue in mid January and now I find myself in this position.  My family and friends have been wonderful but I have started suffering from terrible panic attacks. I am grieving for the life I had and the fear is overwhelming. I am desperate for answers but terrified as to what the doctors will tell me tomorrow. I don't feel like I'm going to get a fair chance at fighting this thing off.  Any support on how to get through this worry and panic would be so much appreciated. I am so grateful to have found this forum. Kind Regards, Lucy",
