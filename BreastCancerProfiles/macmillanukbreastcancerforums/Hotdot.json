      "Content": "Hi Barbara Thanks for your post I have 4 treatments to go Woohoo!!! can't wait to stop having to go to the hospital. Especially now we have the snow. I feel OK apart from my sore boob, although everyone I speak to seems to insist I must be feeling tired, I'm not but I almost feel obliged to be lol. Do you have to go back to hospital for a follow up? and are you on Tamoxifen, I am but would rather not be, but I guess its a small price to pay, I have been told that fir two weeks after the skin will continue to be sore but then it should start to improve, nice Xmas present . Hopr you are feeling better now, have a great Xmas Dot",

      "Content": "Hi Vicky I have had the gel pad since day one, I am 18 treatments in and 7 to go I was told that the gel increases the radiation to the area it covers so that \"any stray cells are zapped\". I am having problems with my skin which is very red and sore underneath and am seeing the nurse to put dressings on each day after my treatment. Thankfully due to all the gel and parrafin wax dressings being used there are no breaks in the skin. Can't wait for it to be over, not been tired or anything else just sore, itchy and often miserable. I was told the cancer was removed , all margins clear and no spread to lymph glands, I know I should be happy its gone and grateful for my life back so why do I keep feeling down with no enthusiasm to do anything. I wonder if anyone else feels this way ? Dot x",
