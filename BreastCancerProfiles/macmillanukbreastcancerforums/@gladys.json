      "Content": "Hi folks Can anyone shed any light on how long sentinel node biopsy results take to come back? I had mx and node removal on 21 Dec and no results yet! I know my tumour has been sent for FISH testing band that takes a while, but was expecting node results sooner. Nurse has said they aren't back yet and to wait until appt next Friday..... I'm assuming now that the nodes are positive and she just didn't want to say until I see consultant next week. Not anxious but frustrated!",
