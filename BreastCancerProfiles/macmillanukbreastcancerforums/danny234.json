      "Content": "Hi I'm new on here and just thought I could find out more information and see if others experienced the same. My mam found out she had breast cancer 7 years ago and had her breast removed but did not have any chemo or anything. We were told that it was clear and it had gone but was she was put on Tamoxfan or something like that and stayed on them for around 5 years then changed over to Femmera for the remaing time. Well my mam has been feeling unwell since christmas time last year symptoms were feeling sick, loss of energy, loss of appetite, pains in the stomach area and pains in the lower back near the spine, we went to our G.P and he said it was muscular pains and gave her pain killers so we waited a few weeks to see if it would clear up and it didn't so we went back to the G.P and he said she had a chest infection then gave her Amoxicillin for infection so we waited again to see if it would clear but never did then we went to the Hospital a week later to see if they would do anything or find anything else so they ran a blood test and did x ray but the blood came back clear and they put the stomach pains down to constipation and they gave her Codein for the pain and sent her home we gave it abit time to see if it would go away and it didn't so we ended up going back to the G.P 2 or 3 weeks later and he said this time the pains in the side was Kidney infection and gave her some Ibuprofen and something else but it went on like that for awhile until we went to another hospital near us because the pains were getting worse and they did a blood test and an x ray this time they said that the blood test had something wrong with it and thought it might be a blockage of the bile duct so she was kept in and she had a ultrasound scan 2 days later to see what it was inside the consultant came around on his rounds and gave the bad news that he is pritty sure the cancer has come back in the liver so we were all upset I was pritty angry as well since it was time lost with the G.P saying it was different things instead of sending for test or something but at the moment she has to go and have a CT scan and another type of scan for the bones next week and see an oncologist but time at the minute seems to move so slow and I worry all the time because I would hate to lose my mam now she helps me through alot and now I help her. Can anyone tell me what the outcomes of people had from this? She has to have chemo to but we don't know when yet, the consultant is waiting for the results of the scans before he decides on what treatment to give but says he will tell us the results a week on Tuesday, can anyone give some advice or what can happen? Thanks Danny",

      "Content": "Thanks for all your help and support but just thought I'd let you all know that my mam got worse within the last week after taking the 1st round of chemo and each day got more worse until yesterday when she passed away so she is no longer with me. It is hard to take and I'll miss her so much but she is at peace now and not in pain. Just thought I'd udate it here. Thanks for support Danny x",

      "Content": "Just another update on things, my mam has now been put onto chemo called vinobine or something which is a tablet (5 takin every week for 6 weeks) the oncologist told us he was worried about my mam if she could tolerate it because she so tired all the time and has cancer in the lung, liver and bones. He told us that it could make her worse if she can't cope with it so she had to decide wheather to take the chance but told us even with the chemo she only has 6 months - 1 year. She decided to go ahead with it and took them and now on day 3 and she is knackered, no energy at all, sleeping most of the time and I'm just really worried, it's very hard for me and 100x worse for my mam. Has anyone been on this chemo before and done well with it? It's been a huge shock and everything is happening at once :o( Danny x",
