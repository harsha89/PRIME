Now the anesthetic is wearing off!!!!! hopefully it will feel better tomorrow. But at least i will not feel like a pin cushion from now on. take care everyone, i get my 2nd chemo tomorrow, hopefully i will not be in the hospital for so long this time.",

My choices are Tram flap ( tissue and muscle taken from my tummy ) he kindly said there was just about enough of it.  Or the Latissimus Dorsi flap, the muscle and tissue tunneled from the back to make a new breast. Has anyone had either of these ops, and would you mind telling me in detail what it really feels like afterwards.  I have read on the macmillan website that the breast will feel numb, but no one seems to say what it feels like when walking or moving about, within the body does it move like a normal breast and feel like a normal breast.  Hope this makes sense but as the surgeon is a man i didn't think he would know. Any help would be appreciated, i have decided not to have the op until next year, so i have plenty of time to gather information and make a decision. Jules49",

The day after we arrived home i started my Radiotherapy and it is going OK so far, only two to go on monday and tuesday.  The 50 miles round trip seems to be tiring us out, i have to take a travel sickness tablet every day because they move the bed around so much with me on it.  my skin has gone a little red but i can still wear the bra and get out christmas shopping. I am feeling very positive at the moment.  Thinking of returning to work in the new year and celebrating my 50th birthday.  I have decided that leisure time is going to be punctuated with work and not work punctuated with leisure from now on................my friends, bless them are arranging a weekend away with me too.

I was wondering how soon after the treatment the hair would grow back, or even if it would mid way through the treatment as they change the drugs on the 4th.  I see yours did grow back sooner rather than later - i must admit everyone i've seen at the clinic so far have their hair so it gives me hope the baldness will not last too long.  ",

I had the reconstruction in March this year, the procedure is a long one and it was rough at times, but WOW, i can't tell you what its done for my confidence.  Everyone remarks how good i look, thats because i feel like a sexy woman again.  sorry to get personal but my sex life has improved too because of the way i feel.  God bless the NHS. I am to return to hospital next year to have the right breast reduced and a few fillers added to the left lside by using lyposuction on my hips.  so all in all i will have two younger looking breasts, feel better about myself, flatter tummy and no fat on my hips.  Its a win win situation. I wish you luck in making your decision, I encourage you to discuss every little detail with the surgical team.  My surgeon is very approachable and patient, he is honest but does his best to give me what i want.  The next time i see him we'll be discussing what kind of nipples i want, so it does get a bit bizaare but it's his work and my body so we both work together to get the best result. Take care and I hope everything goes OK for you.",

I have my nails done and go for a massage anything to lift my spirits.  talk to your friends and family about it, tell them how you feel and ask them to cheer you up.  giving them something positive to do for you may be all they are waiting to hear. i am a d cup, and asked for reconstruction at the same time as MX, and it was not recommended, as radiotherapy alters the skin and tissue so much, my GP said he has had loads of patients come back to him with disformed reconstructed breasts, which needed to be removed and start again. I had mx april 2011.  I plan to have Tram flap in Feb 2013.  i am not allowed implants on the NHS because of the radiotherapy. the nhs surgeon said i would be able to get a private clinic to do it, but he would not recommend it. I think you may need to speak to your breast care nurse about getting therapy, talking to someone about how you feel, before you go for reconstruction.  Ask the hospital if they have a dvd of women who have had the op, see what they look like without clothes on.  the dvd i saw was excellent from Newcastle General.  i darn't get too excited about the result, the surgeon says it is to give me a breast shape under clothes, so it will not be perfect when i am naked.  my husband doesn't mind. you don't say if you have a partner.  i think its a confidence thing and can be changed so don't be downhearted every day, ask for help and talk, talk talk, do something positive about it and don't let the cancer win. be positive jules",

I had a 73mm tumour grade 2 invasive ductal cancer with lobular like growths in the left breast and was advised mastectomy was the best option, then pre cancerous cells were found in two of the lymph nodes, so a second op was needed to remove all the lymph nodes. luckily no other cancer cells were found. I was then advised to have 6 x Fec-t and radiotherapy.  they still await the results to confirm if i am HER2 Positive or HER2 Negative so not sure which hormonal treatment is needed. The BCN always says the chemo and RT are insurance policies against the cancer returning.  and from what i have read on numerous UK and USA web sites i agree and am happy to receive the treatment.  i know there are side affects short and long term, but feel chemo does the trick.  if one cell in my body is even thinking of changing then i want it to be dead and gone.  many many women i know have had exactly the same treatment as myself and are here to tell their story 10 20 and 40 years later. so i say bring on the treatment. all i can advise you is to check again with your health care workers, but also do some independant investigation yourself and of course you have started by asking here for others thoughts.  i am not sure if all this has helped but hope you find information you are searching for and feel more confident about the treatment soon.",

      "Content": "Hi, i was first diagnosed in March, had a mastectomy in April and Axillary clearance to take the lymph nodes away in may.  My chemo started in June, and i have had my 2nd lot out of 6 FEC-T. I slept last night for the first time with no hair, and i have to say it was a bit chilly.  I decided against cold cap treatment, how about you?  I have loads of nice scarves and my wig for best.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear lots of ladies hair grow back before the end of chemo, but i'll not count my chickens just yet, as long as it starts to come back for the winter. Take care, hope you are still feeling OK. Jules",

      "Content": "Hi mjangelfairy - my scalp started to tingle at day 15 and the hair started to shed at day 17.  over the next few days lots of shedding happened, i decided to comb my hair in the garden so as not to get it all over the house!!  It continued to fall out for about a week, but i still had lots of it.  after my 2nd chemo most of it came out on day 5 and today i have cut the rest off myself.  my scalp is still a bit 'fluffy' but i'm sure this will come out in the shower over the next few days. I am glad to hear you have not had too many side effects, lets hope it stays like that all the way through, keep strong jules49",

      "Content": "Has anyone elses family experienced guilty feelings.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in march 2011.  thankfully surgery removed it completely and i have just completed chemo.  my sister who is ten years older than me found it very difficult to deal with the situation and says the doctor has given her tablets but will not discuss what they are.  she is behaving strangely and has mood swings when she visits me and i would like to help and understand her more.  back in march she took to mothering me at first and calling me 'baby' which i found strange.  then she cried at every visit, and now when i tell her of my chemo side affects she states she is getting the same problems!! what is going on? has anyone else experienced strange affects of their diagnosis on their relatives.  i feel i am quite positive about my condition and basically i get on with it, but my sister finds it impossible to do, she has an unhappy home life where as mine is great and my husband is my friend so i don't know if its guilt or her being jealous of the support i am getting.  jules49",
