    "Content": "Hi Louise, I was 24 years old when i was diagonised with breast cancer at the begining of this year. My WLE revealed that my whole left breast was covered with DCIS and that my only option was a Mastectomy. I then made the choice to have both breasts removed at the same time -although i was lucky enought to be offered reconstructive surgery at the same time as the mastectomy, which really did help a great deal as i woke up after the op with better breasts than before!! Everyone is different with regards to how you recover - i was lucky enough to be out of hospital after 3 days - being at such a young age i knew my body could handle the op. although i did prepare my body before the op by eating plenty of fruit and veg. i was sore - but never in great pain and in fact i think i only took paracetomal while at home. It will take some time for you to be able to move your arms freely again etc - and almost 5 months down the line i still get a little pain every now and then!!!! I stayed off work for 2 months as well. I found the hardest thing was to look down and see my scars - i had my nipples removed therefore i have scars across both breasts and under both my arms where the lymph nodes were removed. and although i know they can do reconstruction for these, looking down and seeing something different was hard to get used too. but it is not the end of the world and only myslef and my partner know about the scars. eventually it does become easier, and after months my scars are finally starting to fade. I wish you all the best for your op - and i hope your recovery is as successful as mine was. Reagrds xxx",
