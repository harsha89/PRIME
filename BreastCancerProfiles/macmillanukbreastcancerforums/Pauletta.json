      "Content": "Hi Suzie, I\u2019m having my 2nd cycle next week so have some limited experience so far. I\u2019ve jumped over from the womb cancer forum where I got some great advice from the women on there. As we are all different and the drugs affect us in different ways - reading around the subject may have some relevance! I was pointed towards an article written by Decca Whitehead who went through chemo and wrote a piece about her experience - I think titled, what the medics don\u2019t tell you about chemo! I found it invaluable, especially the research on fasting and chemo. I read the clinical trial reports and was so impressed I decided to give it a go. There is limited evidence as the trial was small - but it didn\u2019t involve having to invest in supplements or things like expensive honey - it was a way for me to take some control - and it\u2019s free!! I do not want to recommend fasting as it would be dangerous for some people so this is a personal choice for me - I fasted for 2 days before treatment and on the day - just drank lots of water and fruit teas. I did get caffeine withdrawal so will allow myself a coffee next time! All I can tell you is that, apart from some pains in my legs - I was fine afterwards. but perhaps I was just lucky and I may not be so good the next time? For me it is worth doing again. I also got prepared with hair pieces and a good wig - I used the cold cap but was expecting to lose my hair - well today it literally ALL fell out - so I\u2019m now wearing a beanie hat and my fringe wig as it\u2019s too hot for a whole wig! I also took advice from one of the women on the womb cancer forum and got my eyebrows tattooed - I\u2019m really pleased with them and would never have thought about doing this before. Sounds vain but I want to try and get through this with some sense of putting a brave face on - oh and I\u2019ve booked onto one of the Look Good - Feel Better make up courses for those going through chemo - if you google them they run courses nationwide - mine is half way through my 6 cycles so mY need a boost by then! I hope I\u2019ve managed to pass on some information which may be of use? Good luck - virtual hugs and just know you are not in your own. Pauletta xx",

      "Content": "Hi Suzie I got my \u2018winges\u2019 from a charity called Heathers Hair based in Devon I think. They use human hair and it is sewn onto soft headbands. They only charge Â£8 for p&p!! So I also sent a donation. I bought a full hair band so the hair goes all the way around - looks like you have a head of hair when wearing a hat. I also bought a half head - hair from ear to ear - wearing it now under a beanie!! If you google them I\u2019m sure you will find their site. I\u2019m really impressed with them - they both need a hairdresser to trim and style them but my hairdresser is on holiday this week - agh bad timing. So I\u2019m just wearing it and flicking my fringe to the side - at least it looks like I have some hair! Good luck with everything. Pauletta xx",

      "Content": "Hi Maggiemee Apologies - her name is Decca Aitkenhead - blooming chemo brain!! I have copied the link to her Guardian article for you below: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/03/how-to-get-through-chemotherapy-decca-aitkenhead-cancer-treatment Thanks for the link you shared about fasting - it was really interesting and refers to the study Decca wrote about. It was enough to convince me to give it a go. Time will tell if it keeps working!! Pauletta xx",
