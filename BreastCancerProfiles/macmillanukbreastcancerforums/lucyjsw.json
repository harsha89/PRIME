      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer age 34, I had lobular tumour in situ, stage 2, scored 8/8 for oestrogen receptors. I had radio therapy, 2 year of zoladex and 5 of tamoxifen. I am now 50, I have a full cycle since stopping zoladex and have horrific bleeding. Had fibroid removed and partial ablation done about 4 years post and was discharged by gynaecologist. My old GP was awful repeated appointment = trans vaginal scans and ultimately being told by GP he didn't do women's problems (seriously). refused requests for referral, new GP surgery who is lovely and after well women check was told to see GP to discuss bleeding, she suggested Mirena coil as this didn't fit trying Jaydess but now Im getting really cold feet re using hormones and don't know who to ask, was discharged from oncology 2 years ago and last year from breast clinic . . . . any one had any experience/guidance. ",
