    "Content": "Hi. So sorry to hear this. I'm writing on behalf of my 93 year old Mum who had a double mastec. in 2001. She has always had a cough but on occasions it has been worse especially in dry atmospheres and dry weather with lots of pollen. We used china, hang on the radiator humidifiers, which need filling with water to help and recently have just bought a warm electric humidifier from Argos which has also helped her. It appears to be all about keeping the throat etc moist. In the past the GP has given her an asthma pump but my sister, a past physio, asked if the GP could provide a nebuliser with saline water will see if he does. Mary",
