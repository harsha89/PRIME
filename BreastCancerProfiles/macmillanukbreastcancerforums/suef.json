      "Content": "I know I've not been on this site for a while. I had reconstruction just before Christmas and things didn't go too well. A section of the diep flap died so despite leeches and skin grafts I lost some of the new breast. I ended up having several operations over a period of months adn was just beginning to feel that things were improving (only one more op to go hopefully) So my husband felt it would be OK to go on a cycling holiday. Then I get the dreaded phone call - he's had an accident!. He broke his back, ribs, wrist and had multiple facial fractures. They operated to fix his back and had put 7 plates in his jaw and were pleased with his progress, scheduling another op to fix the rest of his face.  But then he had a pulmonary embolism and died a week after the accident. I can't believe how awful the last 2 years have been. I feel so lost. Sue f",

      "Content": "I too don't know which reconstruction to go for.  I had the mastectomy about 6 months ago and still feel the loss of my breasts, I feel like everybody must be able to see how lop sided I am (even though my daughter assures me that noone can tell). I have been told that I probably can't just have implants as my cup size is too large.  Does anyone else know if this is true? Sue xx",
