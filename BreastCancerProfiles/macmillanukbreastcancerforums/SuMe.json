      "Content": "Hi all, am hoping someone out there can help me feel a bit less stressed - had my pre-chemo chat yesterday (for what it was worth) and am now more anxious that ever about it! Had mastectomy & implant recon about 7 weeks ago, initially expected just to have radio but SLNB came back showing signs of infection so was told I needed chemo - I coped fine with the change in treatment plan, had my long hair cut short and was ready for anything - or so I thought! Had my appointment yesterday at 11am, turned up a bit early and was told to wait, tiny waiting area in the chemo unit sat with about 6 others who were waiting for their chemo. No-one spoke to any of us for about half an hr, nurses laughing and joking with each other & the receptionist but no communication with any of us waiting. After about half an her one of the nurses walking past joked \"sorry ladies we're running really late today, pharmacy haven't sent up any of the chemo so none of this lot in here (pointed to another room) have even started yet - at least it's not our fault this time - ha ha!\" Another half hr later a nurse came and told me she wanted to take my bloods, she had no idea what was going on \"I'm new here sorry\" didn't even ask if I'd had any op or if there was a side to not use for the bloods I had to tell her to use my right arm when she went to use my left, and then she said to wait again - I've now been waiting over an hr - I asked how long she thought it'd be and she said she'd no idea but would find out - I just thought if I had to wait so long someone could've said something and I'd have gone for a coffee or something? She came back saying \"you can go for a coffee it'll be some time yet\" - I asked roughly how long, she had no idea. Thank goodness I had hubby with me I'd have walked out and come home, was the most unwelcoming and unfriendly place I've been to in a long time. And such a contrast to everything before, everyone had been so good until I got to the chemo unit. Now I don't want to go back for the actual treatment, I want to ring my BCN and tell her I don't want to go there. I don't know if I can ask to go somewhere else - has anyone else done this?? I just feel so bad about going back there next week I really don't want to go",

But still terrified :( And Tony - I have spoken to my BCN and she's made a few calls - am now worried I'm going to be labelled a troublemaker. Oh I really do hate this sh*tty cancer and all the cr*p that goes with it!",

      "Content": "Hi sunshine and Angela, Its such a tough time at the moment, when you've just been diagnosed and you're completely lost, I felt that everyone else seemed to know exactly what they were talking about and how to cope, and I read the posts here and got so scared at the comments people were making because they were talking about things that were new and scary and treatments that I didn't know about. You learn a whole new language really quickly, and if there's anything at all you're not sure about it really is ok to ask. I felt it was bit  like you become part of this new parallel world that you sort of knew existed but knew nothing about, and it's really scary and new for a while but very soon it does becomes the new normal. There are so many different ways to treat breast cancer and it's quite comforting to know that whatever you end up doing is totally personalised to you - there's no 'one size fits all' so your treatment will be planned looking at your own particular diagnosis And will be targeted in the best way for you. I had no idea there were so many different types of breast cancer! I was initially told that I'd need to have a lumpectomy then radiotherapy, but then had mri and more biopsies and that was changed to mastectomy, which I had 3 weeks ago, and now I've been told I need chemo before the radio. So be aware that things can change as you go along! Am now waiting for my chemo appointment. please do remember that you are definitely not alone, I know it can feel that way (I'm the only one of my friends who's had to face this, although I do know several colleagues from work who've been through treatment) but this site can really help. im here if you want to chat at all, if you want to talk through whats happening? And so are lots and lots of others  on here, we're all just the same as you someone who had their world turned upside down with a diagnosis none of us want!! We're just muddling through as best we can, some good days and some bad days, trying to make sense of it all!! take care, sending you love and hugs xx",

      "Content": "  Hi AliOwl, Jacky, Mrs D, Mrs Beezley, jaqueline, mistymoley Thank you all so much for your replies I feel a bit more reassured now, I will talk to my oncologist next week but am fairly sure we'll go ahead. Like you have said I'm pretty sure the benefits will outweigh the risks, I think making sure I go out for a walk each day will help me and the boys will definitely have to take their turn, hubby is as keen as I am too so he'll be happy to step up when I'm not too good.  Love the pic of your Dougal, Mrs B! I had a rescue dog a few years ago, had her for about 6 yrs she was so sad when she came to me but I loved her to bits and she was an amazing dog settled really well & so happy, just needed a bit of tlc, was heartbroken when we lost her and couldn't think of replacing her then but now boys are older and I'm on enforced work break its the right time!!",

      "Content": "hello all, i have spent quite a lot of time reading comments on this site and have found it so helpful during the last few weeks, but have never posted before - now I have a question, and I'm sorry it's a bit of a silly one but I didn't know who else to ask! i was diagnosed with breast cancer in January & had a mastectomy & reconstruction op last month and am due to start chemo in the next few weeks, I have an appointment with the oncologist next week to discuss the details. my question is this - I know I have to be really careful about infection throughout chemo, but what about handling dogs??? I ask because we had promised my two boys we'd get a dog in the new year, they've been waiting and looking forwards to this for nearly 6 months and all over Christmas we talked about it, we had planned to go to a local rescue centre for one - my boys have been so strong and brave dealing with my diagnosis and i really don't want to disappoint them because this has come along and turned everything upside down! but I'm worried it's not a good idea because of the risk of infections. I know there must be hundreds of people out there who have dogs and are dealing with cancer - has anyone got any advice about whether or not it's ok? I really want it to be ok because it means so much to the boys and I don't want to let them down, but I just needed to check first in case it really is not a good idea. sorry I know I'm rambling a bit and I hope it's not a really silly question can anyone help put my mind at rest please??",

And Dreamthief I have read so many words of wisdom from you on all the posts that you write that I feel i must listen to you! We are looking at one of the less energetic types, I had a German shepherd before but we've seen a gorgeous looking lurcher-type at the local dogs home.  But also E1S1E I will think carefully about what you said I know it's so important to be so careful.",
