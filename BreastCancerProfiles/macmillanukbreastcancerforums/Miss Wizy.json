      "Content": "Hi Jo Good to hear you seem to have settled down with your new boob and are back doing some exercise. I'm not a fitness fanatic but about a year ago & reaching 59 years old I thought I needed to get off the sofa and look after myself, so I started running (last time I did that was 35 years ago!). I took up Park Run and loved it, now I'll have to start from the beginning after the op. Sounds like you had the same operation I'm thinking of having done. I just hope I can recover within the same time frame as you. I do think I'll check with a physio as others have suggested about getting back to exercise especially as it seems you can get tired so quickly and I don't really want to put lots of weight on. Like you I'm not keen on taking bits of me to fill up other parts. At my early diagnosis it looked like a lumpectomy would take care of the tumour but unfortunately it's too large so I'll be saying goodbye to the boob, just hope the new one & I can be good friends. Can I ask if you needed a new bra for post mastectomy, I'm not sure whether I should look now for one or wait until after the op? Kindest wishes Miss W",

      "Content": "Hi Fiddlercrab and Shellian Thanks for your kind words of advice. I think I'm being a bit self deluding here, thought I'd have the op then get over it all in about 3 months...done deal & back to normal. But seems like it's a new normal that I'll have to get used to. I love my running and really don't want to give it up, even though it'll go on hold for a while...just got back to it after 6 weeks off with a torn calf muscle...damn it all! Then this comes along. I see my surgeon next Monday so I'm sucking in as much info as I can to ask the right questions and all these posts are brilliant. I have to remind myself I'm lucky, I have DCIS and I may not need rad or chemo...just a blooming great tumour sitting there! I'm pretty certain I don't want DIEP, I'm not keen on having more invasive surgery to another part of my body & really can't spare the time off work. Where I live they can do that tissue lattice thingy so I'm veering towards that option rather than inserting an implant under the chest muscle. Just want to say thanks to all your helpful suggestions and support. Kindest wishes Miss Wizy",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I'm about to have a left breast mastectomy and also love running so I accept that's a no no until I can get on with my recovery post op. I'm concerned to hear all the weird feelings you have, I still have to decide whether to have reconstruction (which I luckily can have at the same time as the mastectomy) or implant or the flap DIEP.Â  The medics haven't told me about your twitches etc that you describe. I didn't know I might need physio afterwards as well, I'm more confused than ever now. Miss Wizy",
