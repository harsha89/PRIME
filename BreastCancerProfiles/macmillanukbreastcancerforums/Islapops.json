At last i feel things are on the up and that i instead of living in a state of panic and despair, i know no matter what time day or night i can reach out and someone will listen. Helen x",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy,  Sounds like you can carry on with your cravings. So enjoy every minute. Im struggling to curb my cravings of anything sweet and chocolatey. 3 years i lost 4 1/2 stone on slimming world and got down to a size 10-12 which i managed to maintain. However since being diagnosed ive started to gain weight and turning to comfort eating. I maybe panicking but im definately putting weight back on,albeit slowly. But since having my first chemo i crave sugar. I try and tell myself to focus on getting well and that ive lost weight before and i can do it again once i finish trestment. At the moment im still suffering from nausea and just want sugary foods. Im taking the anti sickness meds and it helps. But should i feel so guilty to have a biscuit or cake? Julia,  I dont remember being given a blue book. What foods should i be avoiding?  Hope you can help?  Helen x",
