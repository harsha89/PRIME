NiceCuppa....I am so sorry you had such a bad experience....I always said every nurse should be a patient during training to get the idea of what makes a good nurse.Am so sorry you were left in tears.Maybe a different Hospital isn\u2019t such a bad idea for you....I had a raft of different nurses during my op...I soon saw the ones I liked but as I had just come off the Wards myself...I am afraid I was a bit voluble ...I wasn\u2019t weepy then...but Letrozole saw to that...and I have been very mush since....sorry that was a typo...but I think I will leave it...yes mush is the correct word for how I often am left feeling now....xxx I,also,don\u2019t think you are \u201cbroken\u201d...there must be a nearer word to how you are...maybe very very sad and feeling the hardest times of our cancer journey...But just because you feel like this doesn\u2019t make it true. There will be a time when you will look back on this and see that it is hard,and maybe the hardest time,but that you came through it.I think when they all say,\u201dbaby steps\u201d I think I am still learning that sometimes we can only take a day at a time....and you will get stronger.xxx",

Another BIG advantage of regular(gentle please!)exercise,is that I slept LIKE A LOG!I also was on a food/drink regime where I became a lot healthier and submitted my diary to my PT every week.This ensured that I ate healthily,lost unnecessary weight,and also got to having less alco.yes,painful but healthy!I am now thinking of taking up boxing(gentle,and with my other arm!)as I saw someone do it at the gym and thought what a Brillo idea!Knock that cancer out!

If I were you,I would ring up your Breast cancer Nurse with all this.She is in the best position to help you. As far as the other things go,I now eat a (very,for me)healthy diet,all of a sudden,and i have noticed the changes.so,generally i should keep to lots of fresh fruit and veg and nuts,etc.Not only will this help with any residual constipation,but,I have found,it has also kick-started my immune system. At the end of the day,your breast care nurse may want you to see your Consultant.He/she will be able to see if the wound is too tight.However,you have had a massive op and and an enormoaus scar over your tummy to deal with.mine did feel tight too,but it is a lot better now.Hope this helps a little x",

I agree with Leolady56 and also would like to add,that it is more common these days for GPs to send their patients for a host of investigations for whatever they see them about.Your GP is acting with integrity and safety.However,this doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer. But if you have,he / she is dealing with it promptly and chances are,you will be treated and come out the other side well and happy,which is far more the case these days than it ever has been.I was treated 2 years ago and didnt need chemo or radiotherapy,and the cancer has been taken right away. sorry if this sounds a bit clinical,but your mind will be giving you all sorts of scenarios,but rest assured,90%of these will probably never come to fruition. stay in touch with Macmillan and talk about all your worries.there is also a phone number if you feel you wake up in the night,or just any time,need to just talk. These days treatment is so very advanced and many many people can look back and say,\u201dit was a bit scary but I\u2019m okay\u201dxxx",

As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy. By Max Ehrmann © 1927",

They have access to your own personal information and notes,so their advice will be tailor made for you. Never be afraid to ask anything...they are well trained to manage your information and your emotions (if necessary)... They may ask you to go in to see them...mine did...but sometimes will answer a quick question on the phone if they feel it will be ok. hope this helps...also you can also ring a help here on Macmillan,at the number you find on the Homepage.

      "Content": "Hi. Well,yesterday I went for my yearly check-up since my DIEP. Everyone was very nice (except the uptight receptionist)and I think that might have made me worse.But when I came out I went into feelings of being overwhelmed. It was the first time I had been back properly and I was going thro the whole thing again.i was trying to do 3 things at once as I find it hard to travel alone to these things on public transport,and my long suffering friend was giving me a lift and I didn't want to keep her waiting or keep asking her to take me. The thing is ,last year at this time when I had my operation for cancer I sort of went through it in a sort of denial...I don't ever remember feelings of being overwhelmed. But yesterday I did,and the memories were still there,I suppose. I was taken in to see my Cosultant and she was ever so nice and I was kind of making jokes n things.but when she examined my (good)Breast it was tender and I went \"ouch!ouch!\"and she said would I like a mammogram?i said oh,yes please and she said she thought they could do it there and then without me having to go back. I went thro and had a consultation with my Breast nurse which was for something different. The receptionist was as curt as usual. Then she showed me thro to have my mammogram,and I said ,\"the Consultant asked me to say that it is tender\" She did the mammogram very gently and kept calling me \"sweetheart\"which I didn't mind at all in fact it helped me. Then when I came out I sort of felt really starnge and when the Nurse asked I was ok,she could tell I wasn't. So she kept trying to find me a room unsuccessfully,and I said,\"it's okay I will just go back to my friend\"but she was holding my hand and said,\"I'm not going to let you go\"as I tried to slip away. Anyway,to cut a long story short,I came home and was a bit overwhelmed. Tonight all night I have been feeling the same,and it started when I was watching the Highland midwife and saw the Nurses. I wish I could get rid of this feeling.Xx",

Anyway that was 9 months ago,and I am now so much fitter and less frightened as I dont get breathless now.I only do 2 half hours each week on the warm up exercises...but have kept steadily at it.The trainers are great and good fun.They laugh when I try to scare them with my \u201cguns\u201d.would recommend it to anyone.I used to avoid gym-type activity at all costs!!",

Well,have had a brillo time !!!ahhh my li\u2019l darlings...at one time I put my head up,and Helen,who I keep an eye out for as she is so delicate and tiny,was on the step showing everyone how to dance by kicking her legs out and knowing the moves!!(got that wrong !)and we had a craft bit where the children had to make a model of Jesus walking on the water (\u201cwhy did Peter fall in?\u201dA\u201dbecause he lost his balance?\u201d)and I found the secret every teacher knows..Delegation!,so Henry,who was doing his craft back to front,by sticking bits on before colouring them,wasn\u2019t told off,but was awarded a pont by me for making a prototype which everyone else could copy(I often ask the children how it\u2019s done,as I get there late,depending on a lift)and Toby (my new little gangster)came to me and told me his cousin had had an accident Involving an electric saw on his head...but it was okay coz he was praying for him....(eek!)and little Alan sat with his head covered with his hoodie and sideways to us,very quietly getting on and colouring quite beautifully...I love picking out the quiet ones for praise...there are loud ones who sing but they were happy singing...I thought My knitted knocker would fly out while we were doing the dancing ,but fortunately had anchored it inside the pocket of my mastectomy bra....xx",

While sitting at your desk you could do little up and sown movements with your feet...circular arm movements...etc...this might not seem like much but we used to get patients to do them when on bedrest. valuable aid to circulation,and prevention of complications....

Oh my gosh,that haunted me all morning and still does.He said he didnt like the stress and it was better for him to get out.I have been worried I might have added to his stress coz I started on my life history etc etc...poor man.But he did help by saying my particular op takes a long time to get over...helped a lot really.I was very naughty having a free consultation and am berrating myself now.Oh please go back and be a GP!!!!maybe in research or something.I think I will say that next time I see him... seaspirit44Seaspirit....how lovely to wait for the cherry blossom.We have a tree in our shared garden and I look every year for the cherry blossom to arrive.I have actually fought hard to save it as there is a man here who would like to cut lots of the trees down.When I lived with my Dad I used to watch for the magnoloia tree on the Street corner to bloom every year too.Anyway,I sent a photo of looking outside my window of the garden in Winter....and now I have updated it to my garden in Spring....",

A lot of what you say I can recognise SO well,and is so sad because it happens so much,I can tell you.I remember someone telling me that and it helped in a strange way . Maybe there might be a way where you can \u201cintroduce \u201cyour Mum again to your siblings?maybe a family fun tea out,or (and that is asking a lot with some!)a games together...something which they will all enjoy??and they can see her not as a \u201cburden\u201d.I am not saying this is what is happening with your family...but it does happen. Try not to nag them or make them feel guilty,they will only dig their heels in and it will be worse for you in the end,They may even turn on you a bit,through their guilt. It is tempting to go down the road(or in your case,up!)of getting all angry and bitter.That is so easy but doesnt do anyone any good in the end.Just know that you are doing your very best and you will ultimately have nothing to blame yourself for.... You have the added bonus of many more years being close to her. What is my challenge for today? hmmmm....well I have a number of jobs which tended to be put off while I was so poorly with this \u201cbug\u201d which need to gently be put to bed,one by ome...but the big challenge is to find a long enough slot in one day this week to go and see \u201cCollette\u201d.(a date with the Cinema-yes,I will dress up!!) hugs....xx",

I went to the gym yesterday and took my boxing gloves for a cursory knock about.I actually wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose,but after that I actually swaggered back home and noticed I was walking upright!!blimey,and it was only a punch bag!!felt so much better having vented a few things.... had such a repartee with the trainer,who taught me a bit about boxing in the past(against pads).He asked if I had used the bag,and I said,\u201dyes,I was a bit afraid of using your pads,I might have hurt you\u201d He threw back his head and laughed and laughed as he always does xxx(he is actually 6 feet of pure muscle and really rather gorgeous )",

Speaking of which,have been there this morning.Today in the Bike i had Prokofiev,\u201dPeter and the Wolf\u201don my earphones..(I try to do something to exercise my arms,too)So while on the seated bike,I I was doing little marches and arms held at shoulder height swinging up and down ,the while. and had to keep changing tempo!!but there were two sensible -looking ladies on the other bikes,so my courage drew the line at doing Interpretive Dance,but would have liked that ... I did remember how it scared me so much as a child,hearing the wolf coming!Then I went onto the rowing machine and listened to Candy Man and nearly sprang off there dancing!!love that. (Once I was at the Symphony Hall and the conductor was actually dancing while she conducted!!it was Just Marvellous!!! well...walked past some lovely pansies on way home,but they were sadly a little wind-battered. Back to \u201cLazy Sunday\u201d coffee from my New Cafetiere,which is too fabulous,and indulgent xx I like the Rugby Sunnyone...I used to watch it with my (Scottish )father and they won that year...I am sorry they didnt win...but I think England are going to do well...xxx",

Aghhh!anyway...eventually found out that there is a man who keeps them a road away and had reported one lost.I can\u2019t remember what happened in the end. Headlines???x",

Another thing...if it says \u201ddownloaded \u201c,and takes ages to show in Preview box,just wait a bit and it should appear .Failing that,press \u201dinsert\u201dand it should come up on page... anyway hope this helps. sometimes if the photo is very recent it takes an age todownload.Sometimes I have a feeling that if somebody else is posting at the same time even on another thread,I think sometimes this interferes....

I had a fabo time,I walked along the River this morning and saw some exquisite sites in the sunlight,then went to Church and heard some exquisite singing!!was even able to blend in a bit as the choir ended their procession near to me,still singing,(I always slip in at the back!) Nice ladies talking to me and I recognised a couple from my old CE  who were really nice. Then went to their\u201d Volunteer Fair\u201d...so much going on there!!thought I might like drama sewing and joining the ladies group... I came away a bit overwhelmed there is so much going on there! And then I walked along the sunshiney River and to the Market. My sister was unable to take our Mums satin duvet back with her and,as it is too big for me to store,said I could donate it to a charity...sadly for us.It did comfort me when I was getting over cancer, So This week I phoned around the Charity shops and finally found one which takes second hand quilts and duvets.Acorns (Childrens Hospice charity)does,and I asked if they are used directly for the children and she said \u201cyes,if they are in good condition\u201d Well I took Mums Quilt along with a little note for the lady to say it was Mums and that it would be lovely if it was in good enough condition to be directly used to keep a child warm) so pleased X",

      "Content": "Welcome all newbies,nice to see you...xx Well,I had a LOVELY walk into town this morning and was so cheered by everybodys good moods.(I havent been in for a while,but been using my very impersonal Shoopping Centre) to begin with I cast a sad glance over at the dress shop wheich has closed overnight,where a lovely friend used to work,and always gave me a hug after my operation.... I past a lovely elderly gentleman who stopped and stood aside for me in such a wonderful gentlamanly way so nice and old fashioned,then after smiling and thanking him,I felt he wanted to say something but I was very cross with myself as I had gone by the time I realised.Then took some things into Charity shop ( I like choosing the charity ) and the girl was lovely.Then to a well - known store to order lots of £5 electric toothbrushes which I have found are fantastic for getting in deep, for Christmas presents...but dont tell anybody!!!The Manager was jolly and kept talking to the till as we were ordering.... then over to a bookshop to get some holiday books,found the assistant so very helpful and happy with his friend the other assistant,and gave me the weather forecast when asked... Then to S where I did my shopping and a nice little happy Italian man was at the till who is always so chirpy and helpful.I had given up looking for my points card and he said to take my time and actually pointed it out in my purse -of-many- pockets -and -receipts for me. Then I saw my taxi man who I did have a lil crush on,but he didnt seem interested,and got quietly into his cab,expecting a quiet journey home.In the event he was extremely chatty and said he hadnt seen me for a long time and how was I?  Etc etc....and as I got out told me to look after myself. well,for us older people,I\u2019ll tell you what, give me my local shops,rather than Shopping Centre  anytime....and I mean it.Love them all.",

But seeing that GP gave me such a weird feeling.Waht a waste!!I it was a bit like going into your GP and finding a taxi driver sitting there!! Anyway I have made similar choices in my career doing my SRN training successfully,then opting to be a Care Assistant again after years of private Nursing.Stress and the NHS.....hmmmm....could write a book. on to happier things....the daffs are looking tremndous and alsmost defiant of the horrid snows.my little tiny patch of garden is boasting pink,and purple hyacinths,soooooo preeeeeeeeeety....and my twin is paying a visit from other lands and he will take me out for walks,sure as eggs is eggs...it was him who galvanised me into the gym....probably saved my sanity and life as I was being Quite the coach potato....(yes hes always been the sporty one...I was always the doormaouse) sorry about story of my life ...got nobody to talk to really....Bless you for listening,love you all xxxx",

      "Content": "Ooo,great advicelindylou,about the painkiller.... sorry to butt in,but I wanted to tell you about part of my \u201cwalk back to happiness \u201chas been becoming a Sunday School leader /helper,after having to take early retirement...and here is how it went today....\u201dWell,I have to say,Sunday School was really ace today.As I got out of the car from my lift I could discern whose voice was the loudest coming from before Church Service.!As I walked into Church I saw a little lump behind the Curtain and it was Helen the tiny 2 year-old with blonde curls,and she smiled at me today.(afterwards her big brother who is 4 and an excellent Goalie btw,helped her going downstairs ..they are a gorgeous family.We were all to play games outside (organised)and I was put in with the bean bags.(I know my place).My first group were my own SS group and to make it more exciting I did it \u201cboys against the girls\u201d.The girls were really good and actually beat the boys...but it was fab to see one of my little tear -aways get the maximum of 12 and I asked him to help me score as he was good at sums and he was excellent.He won a point from me.I told them I was proud of them.The little girl who originally backchatted me,comes up to me every week now and tells me something.today it was that she could say her name in sign. the older ones were with us too today and some of the older girls( 13-14 yr olds ) were chatting with the teenys.It was lovely to see and they obviously love them.Then it got thirsty and I asked the leader if we could all have the icepops but they didnt yet so I opened my flask and gave alll the teeny ones in the shade with me a cup of water.I made sure Ann got one,,she is the little girl who has been adopted.(They say it takes a whole Village to bring up a child and I love to do my bit.)Maybe I shouldnt say this but thrre were two young men ( about 14) who were telling me their names and I didn't know them and I was playfully singing ones \u2018 name (O****r) and the girls were laughing at me.Later I found out they were the Pastor\u2019s boys.Extremely polite,but like all boys,were up to trouble and one threw his twins\u2019 red trainer out of the window .I thought I mustn\u2018t let them off just \u2018coz they are the Pastors boys,and so I sent one of them down,one -shoe -on -and -one -shoe -off,into the car park to get the shoes. if I could have taken a cameo of any moments,it would have been,the little girl who goes with her name,Lacey,straddled at the end of the line so tiny and not good at all at games but quietly joining in.Also one of the 14- year olds talking adoringly to the little ones.The other one,my tear -away taking responsibity well by counting the score and getting 12/12.xxx\u201d",

Then spent nearly an hour in photo shop trying to download 25 photos for my hand made cards.It should have taken ten minutes but they kept wafting me aside to deal with the queue of peopl...(All I wanted was for one of them to wave their magic all-knowing finger on to the correct button on the machine-and I WAS there first!) went shopping and awarded myself a tiny icecream, Came home and after a bit of studying,and time,managed to download 4 nice tunes for different things onto my Iphone.Something which Couldn\u2019t Be Done.xxSo yes,am very happy and feel like a success after feeling like a complete techy failure!!",

As I couldnt go back to sleep,I decided to do my mending while there was full daylight and nobody wandering passed my window if I took my transparent curtians out of the window (they do).

I will see if I can find the photo,Seaspirit....but my sister lives near to Hampton Court and so I took a Coach journey about every 2 months last year to meet her there....it was part of my recovery plan for myself...(long story,but had had a year of loneliness \u201ceased\u201donly by very painful regular encounters ,she had listened to me all year on the phone...and decided to prescribe myself seeing lovely people instead so prescription:meet my lovely older sister 4 times a year...bear with....) Anyway,I took the notion to dress up in a mysterious or dramtic costume with great backdrops...(as you do)As you know I am nothing if not a bit creative and eccentric!!My lovely older sister,humoured me.... So one day I dressed up as a mysterious lady with black lace mask  and black fan,(not in photo)covered by my vintage black velvet cloak.... obviously I kept most props tucked well inside my handbag on the journey!! In the event,Hampton Court was unusaully empty and we managed to find a massive room with beautiful fireplace and she took some photos of me!! it was fun...and then I found an assistant in costume and asked if I could have a picture with her....she agreed,very patiently,and I have somewhere a photo of me as I found myself approaching her from behind (not deliberate)and laughing to myself as she was dignified but looking sideways at me rather worriedly!!it was not deliberate but it was funny!!i wouldnt have embarrassed her for the world...but I suppose I needed to let my playfulness out... I will try and find the photo....xx oh dear,do you think me Very Silly??????!, yes,I am practising to be an eccentric old woman!!xx",

Pat with his sheepdog toy(who once memorably brought him back to my fold )has now a tiny dalmation...thinking hard for that spiritual significance.... We did Joshua and the walls of Jericho(quick burst of Mahalia Jackson please!)and they loved it,all except the ones who went round anti-clockewise,the ones who camped in the middle,and Sam,who was very upset that he didnt have a whoopsie to blow.and had a good hard kick of a cardboard box bit of the wall...He was a bit naughty all round today.Being  a helper,today,(as ran out of time for small groups..)I had the privilege of rounding up the strays...and after a few scuffles( where I actually separated them and moved the perpetrators- bit old- fashioned I know...but works!)and collected one (the major scuffler)writing on the blackboard at the back.He told me his Mummy was on holiday,and took my hand and he sat with me.During that time he was crying a bit saying he missed his Mummy.Oh,thank goodness I didnt tell him off too much....and I did mention that fact to the Teacher as he was knocking himself out with naughtiness today....I loved that he held my hand and told me what was wrong....and I sat him on my big seat (while I was nearly falling off sideways!!)next to me.,with my arm poised behind him so he felt warm. Afterwards I was telling the Teacher (Janet)how I love the 4-year olds,it is like in the Bible where it says \u201cThe...faces of their angels ...look on the face of God\u201dand she said \u201cWell mine is 12 going on 16 and a scamp.\u201dlol.. Oh. But then one of them came up and asked for a glass of water ...Ooo!and another was Oliver Twist and said could he have some more?the best bit is where they touch your leg or something in a trusting way to ask a question...and I an getting used to them now,and they to me,i.e.I know Susuan will always sit at the back cos she doesnt like the noise,and we are ok with that.A tiny Japanese girl was marching round pd the walls and looking over with her tiny thumb up!to me...so tiny it isnt bigger than a pin.The same little girl who asked me to take her to the toilet and I was afraid she would fall in!! I could write all day about them....they are the best xx (all names changed obviously)kk",

Quelle Domage,especially since I needed to shop etc and dont have a car!! Anyway,my twin bro and older sister by email, both started nagging me to go to gym . So silly of them I thought,and also ignored them since they are suuuuch sporty types and always have been(.Far too much like hard work!!) Anyway,I started going to gym thro a scheme put on by local Surgery where they paid half your first 3 months.when I asked the GP she said \u201cYou\u2019re not obese....\u201dbut in fact the scheme was relevant as I needed to get fit after my cancer. Some weeks they were the only people I met,and were friendly and we started to have some banter,(the trainers weren\u2019t at all stuffy.) Then a funny thing happened...I actually started to enjoy it!!(and I did start to \u201cget fit\u201d(I had to go to physio at one point and my physio ,memorably ,one day was looking at my arms and said I looked \u201cfit\u201d,in a throw away remark.(I think he meant \u201cfit \u201cfit,not \u201cfit\u201dfit.)never been told that before!!obviously my T shirt hid some ugly secrets!!) and my breathless ness and dizzy spells eventually got better!!and whats more,I was enjoying it!! I will tell you a secret,I Read my book on the cycle quite happily ,and nobody bothers me!! And to help you,I am still,18 months later,on the warm up exercises!!....you don\u2019t have to knock yourself out...as my PT said,it is good that I am having the activity.

All so busy making the most of the sunshine!!and the flowers cheered me up a treat!!AnnJac...colleagues like him are worth their weight in gold. moomy....I have been doing out my flat ,cleaning,tidying,moving furniture round.Much better than a workout this morning!! ...only to find my hoover stopped working...just as I needed it most! so,used as well as poss and ceremoniously chucked the entire thing out!!oh that felt good...it is a bit old and I cant get bags for it.Sat and ordered a new one..Getting place ready for a friend coming on Fri...upended lots of cupboards,sofa....chairs,in order to get behing sofa...then...just as I had finished for the day,got a msge saying she was cancelling. Oh flip!!I had made my cushion and stuff esp for her to sit on.... When she explained I understood.She is being what so many middle-aged ladies are being;i.e.surrogate Mum to her grandson,;looking after her Dad who has been very unwell indeed;working almost full-time on a very busy Ward.... oh I feel so sorry for her now.XXX",

      "Content": "Thankyou so much,lovely HappyFeet1...I never know if I should write about Sunday School but I do love it!never had the chance when I was care assisting...had to work weekends...but a Good Thing to come out of early retiremnet and all the rest of it..Sunday School was..... Lively! So i felt a bit like the sheepdog getting them to listen to the teacher,in the first bit...and I found out two things today,,, that Joeyhas ADHD which I suspected, And I let him and Ben draw on the blackboard as they are both a bit similar and turns out they were both listening..and Ben was good as gold snd collected up after the others.(afterwards in a talk with the teacher she said they both had ADHD.,she thinks.) (I find that as long as my children are doing something they are happy..so I always ask for their help....) There was a drama where they volunteered to be the snake, doctor, or antidote... and that was great ....(afterwards Tim told me quite happily he knows what to fo for a real snake bite as he has had them as pets and began to tell me how big they were( true)..but I managed to not let him tell me) Ben is a bit of a favourite and comes and sits on my lap at the back and Joey said he had diarrhoea,and Tim asked me\u201d is that the Squits?\u201d(all names changed obvS) Then then I had my own group( Reception and Year One)And..despite Simon rolling around I found they were listening to me too as I asked them a question at the end each one as they left,and Joey told me without hesitation,that Jesus is the Light of the World... So proud they took it in after all....and I know,being arty,that sometimes you can listen better when you are drawing too,etc...x",

Yesterday I was having a little break from Maccy...and my cold came back!!! So I have had it for -oh-feels like since 2018 ,now....but did go to town and did some nice things.I took a skirt back and ordered a lovely velvet top (In Sale)which I LOVE...sorry it might sound tright but nothing can cheer me like retail therapy!! Then went back to BTP (yes!it seems to be becoming a regular thing now!)looking for a doggie to pet... There was a tiny poodle under a table at the far end ...he didnt look like he wanted a pet..a bit stand-offish.,I thought..(..I admit I much prefer  big old dogs...who really look like they are old enough and have been thro so much that they appreciate a pet...)..anyway,nil desperandum,I settled on a cosy sofa and ordered a veggie burger.It came complete with lovely thin chips!!I admit it was gorgeous... Do you think doggies are like their owners?just a thought... Then I felt my cold coming back (I had thought I was bit better)and when the waitress came by asking if everything was ok,I said \u201cLovely but slightly draughty,sorry)..she disappeared and reappeared with ablanket !!!Oh My...I did feel coddled ...she was lovely!! I took my leave soon after...I hate to think I am passing a bad cold on...and as I was leaving I said to a (?)Manager,\u201dOh I just wanted to say thankyou to that waitress who gave me a blanket when I was feeling a bit cold,she was everso nice\u201d,after he asked which one,he said,\u201dOh,she hasnt been nice for 4 years..\u201dIt took me a minute to realise he was joking!! Doh...I was born believeing EVRYTHING. Mama used to say,\u201dThey can see you coming\u201dxx",

I can relate to your phone not working for the photos..exactly the same happened to me a week or two ago...and there were some Just Wonderful swan pics I could have taken...one charmer stood on her legs and reached up to full height on the pavement in front of me.Grrr ...however,it meant I just had to enjoy the moments.... today I went to Knit and Natter and it was lovely.My sewing Teacher feiend inspected my embroidery (I really value her opinion)and she said I have very neat stitches and it was beautiful.The thing is,she learnt from her Grandmother so I really respect her opinion,and it is so nice as some people just look at my work and get dead bored,really.(The Thought!!!) she herself had brought in some incredibly intensely beautiful work.She had been making a bag and making the pockets in tiny patchwork...and her stitching was incredibly tiny.I was VERY jealous.I kind of made a joke saying,\u201dThere\u2019s always one\u201dwhich the others and her laughed at as she knew I really really loved it.Huh. xxx",

I took a cushion case which I am hand-sewing..I saw one in a shop at Christmas for £60!!

The Continued Saga of Violetsniffs\u2019 Hip (which only hurt when I went up stairs today...and so rarely use it but have it in my bag just in case) sorry to go on about my hip...but I have a telescopic walking stick (pretty one)which is just slightly too low for me.I have seen one in the local key-makers shop and every time I go past I go and have another look.It isn\u2019t telescopic though.So today I took my courage in bith hands (Courage!Mon Brave!)and went in and asked the enormous muscle man behind the counter if he could do me a big favour?I explained that I loved his stick but that I needed it to be telescopic,and I produced mine.I pointed out that I wasnt strong enough to move the button on the top to make it higher for me.He had a go,and I said,\u201dif you cant do it nobody can\u201din a friendly way,At which point his boss moved from behind his counter and came to help him.Between them they managed it,\u201dgasket \u201c and all,and I said,\u201dOh Bless you,thankyou,!!\u201dand I asked what I owed them.They both kindly waived away any thought of monetry gain.I almost skipped out of the shop saying,\u201dOh!there are some good people left in the world!\u201dand thanking them effusively. It might not seem like much but I have nobody to ask really and I just saw the assistants\u2019 brawny arms.It really is worth asking! xx",

Your husband sounds really kind and supportive.whatever you choose to go with,I really hope you a happy outcome . PS.My Surgery did leave me a little lop-sided,but I have been told I can have further Surgery now,to correct this,which I might plump for. PPs I didn't have to have radiotherapy or chemo,so my case may be different to yours. I am not a specialist in this area and it is best to ask all questions to your BCN nurse and Cancer team hope all goes ok xx",

It does seem to be gradually worsening and I am everso interested to see what others write in answer to your question.I am on Letrozole and had my DIEP 2 and a half years ago,but no chemo. I do \u201dPicturewits\u201d crosswords which I do every night,mainly because I have enjoyed them since before I had cancer. I have sleep problems and at those times it seems worse,but I will keep an eye  on that.They include me being awake until ,say,4 or 5 in the mornings and then sleeping in.I do have to limit my time on Ipad at night etc which seems to exaccerbate this. However these times last for a week or so at a time and then recover.I put it down to doing Nights and Days in the same week when I worked,and I still think that was very unhealthy but we had no choice. I have mentioned it to a GP,who seemed in a hurry with me and said all sorts of things can cause it,not least stress. i think I will to back and see a different GP who has time to look at all my meds etc.I did feel a bit narked as I had waited an hour to see her and it didnt seem thta important to her. But hey,we all have that to deal with... So,yes,thankyou for bringing it up. Letrozole is blamed for lots of things,but I must\u2019nt forget it is a little lifesaver too.

I suppose some people do keep it all to themselves,and I was a past master at this,for various reasons.

(.I was actually wondering while watching it,if anybody would start a thread.) I was only half watching it really,while doing something else...but I loved (and hated-if thats possible?)the way the woman with cancer (?Jenny)said that she was tired of seeing faces which were all sad and caring...although I reallise it is so normal to present this..I found myself wanting to relieve friends and family of their neeed to be sad and caring...sort of thing....Not sure how to put it really... .and well,I was a little uncomfortable with the way the anaesthtic made her hilarious...does that ever really happen?...and it jarred a little with me... all of that part of the story was a little unreal for me,and tended to downplay the need we all have for deep care at that time... But I too,loved the bit with the man who had cancer in the Car Park who took her space...that was very tender.In fact that episode made me bit weepy but in a good way.....xx",

Firstly,try everso hard to try to see the wood for the trees. Secondly,Private care isn\u2019t necessarily better than NHS care..take it from One Who Knows.NHS workers are so fantastic,and I have seen private care being rather tendered out to poor service for the best price,etc etc.(don\u2019t get me started..!) Having said that,You may get the opposite...it was a rather blanket statement...but ...and private may or may not be faster...sorry,not sure there,but you have a point. My brother,who is abroad,and fortunately has a very good job,went private for his hip replacement,and had absolutely zilch aftercare,leaving me worrying about possible post-op complications etc and chewing my nails.But maybe that was cos it was abroad... I am having a similar situation with my older sister as her husband has skin cancer with secondaries ,and are with NHS..and I feel so helpless.It has to be said,they have good and bad experiences.. It is so hard when a loved one has cancer ,but so very hard when we feel helpless to help.XX",

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings, And never breathe a word about your loss: If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! ' If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much: If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son!
