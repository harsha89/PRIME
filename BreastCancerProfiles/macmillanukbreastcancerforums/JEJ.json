      "Content": "Hi , I have my DIEP op scheduled for 9th February.  There has been a lot of discussion around whether this is best option for me. I started smoking a year ago (stupidly) having given up for 9 years and that presents additional risks to the healing process.  I have stopped but am till worried that it will affect the outcome.  I also don't have a lot of stomach tissue and am desperately trying to gain a few pounds!  Has anyone been in similar circumstances?  For me the above is the best option as I want my breasts to change with me as I get older, and not have the worry of further surgery with an implant.  I also feel that I don't want something \"alien\" in my body and feel that using the tissue will give a more natural feel? There is so much information available and so much to take in it feels so overwhelming and now I have my date to go in feels very real! Just writing it down helps and any tips for before, during and after would be appreciated. JEJ",
