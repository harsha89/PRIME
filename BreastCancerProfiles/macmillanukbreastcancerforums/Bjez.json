      "Content": "Hi You poor love I suffered like you after first cycle TCHP.  So they dose reduced by 10% the doxetaxol and carboplatin for cycle2 but I also got my GP prescribe a mouthwash called CAPHOSOL which you can use up to 10 times a day. It's brilliant. Also use Biotene toothpaste every 2 hours.  Food wise it's tragic unfortunately. All your favourite things taste weird and burn. I have tried to avoid dairy products because they make chances of thrush increase and made me feel more sick. Try tinned peachs and pineapple in natural juice. I just have a tin constantly open with a fork and eat them often. For savoury stuff you need the salty stuff and have rediscovered my love for quavers and wotsits!!  It will be ok... hope this helps.. Xxxxx",

I am told this is not Herceptin but as I am now 3 months after the carboplatin and doxetaxol why is this getting worse?? It's awful. I also feel knackered and dizzy after the Herceptin which is worse each time? Can't imagine how much worse this is going to get if I have another 10 Herceptin!! The team seem to dismiss this.

      "Content": "Hi... Just had my 3rd cycle of doxetaxol and herceptin but also having carboplatin and pertruzamub too. Or oknwn as TCHP. It's a rough tough combo. The first one was really rough as I didn't know what to expect but here is some advice which may help: The first doses is always a loading dose so next one should be lower. You need to have anti sickness tablets and you need to take them. 2 days of zofran then regular metroclopramide. The mouth is a big problem I brush my teeth every 2 hours with biotene toothpaste ( get it from boots) when you have your next dose chew ice cubes constantly through the doxetaxol infusion this made a massive improvement after wards also get your GP to prescribe a mouthwash called caphasol which is brilliant ( it is expensive but your GP should do it if not you can buy it on line) Your feet and hands will get sore and \"prickly\" try wearing cotton socks and gloves with loads of moisturising cream massaged in first.  I take regular pain killers for the aches and pains from the GCSF injections which are your saviour in terms of getting your white cell count back up quickly. As far as eating... I lived on jelly and I kept a big containers of cut up fruit. Best ones are melon pineapple black grapes. I avoided dairy foods because I felt they made my throats lol clogged up and added to the nausea. I rediscovered quavers! Try and drink as much as you can. Your taste will come back by about week 3 but not completely. Make a diary of each day and then take it with you to your next appointment. The hospital and team are there to make this journey as easy as they can do you can get the treatment you need.  Good luck... anything else I can help with please let me know. I am only half way through and to be honest I am fed up of feeling like a sack of spuds but know it's not forever and have 3 more to go but at least I can not find my nasty little HER2+++ lump anymore!  Loads of love ❤️ xxx ",

I was a mess when they said they needed to do one on my lump. They give you a local anaesthetic with a little needle first and you feel a tiny sting for a second or two. Then apart from the clicking noise of the biopsy sampler you really won't feel a thing. Get someone holding your hand and chatting to distract you. There are loads of people out there who will tell you a load of shit but on here you will have fabulous brave strong people who will tell you the truth and support you all the way. Xxxxx",

After my 3rd cycle I couldn't find my lump! Nor could the ONC. So I had an MRI scan and they couldn't find the cancer. I still had more chemo then I had a lumpectomy and nodes removed. I had a complete pathological response to the amazing drugs. I have had radiotherapy since then just to be sure and am having Herceptin for another 6 months. This is the treatment regime most places seem to use with great success. They will check your heart and monitor you as there is a very slight possibility of heart damage with Herceptin but it is a very low risk and with all other things considered it's worth the risk. Honestly the worse bit is the waiting and the Doctor googling is terrifying! I made myself ill staying up all night reading stuff until I started the treatment. The nurses and doctors are amazing and the line of treatment although long and a bit scary is the best you can get! You will get through it and the support on here is awesome!  Lots of virtual hugs and love  Bev Xxxx",

I would love a curry or beer but I am only day 12 following my first TCHP and scared of doing anything or eating anything that might make me feel more crappy than I do already.. I suppose its about trial and error. I am having very odd food cravings...baked beans and tuna fish with mayo at 3am....like being pregnant.. B xxx",

I have listed all my SE s to discuss with my onc.. hopefully he will drop doses of dox and carb to ease off the nasty ones. My fingers and toes are my biggest issue now so cold, painful with numbness and tingling.. I have been trying to plaster them with aquaphor and started knitting ( not with my feet! Lol) and I also feel like a big fat slob already! Xx ",

Ask for ice gloves and boots to wear during T that really helps and the mouth  sores etc try chewing ice cubes/chips during the T this saved me from the hideous mucositis I had with first cycle. I am through 3 with 3 to go but delayed as HB low. It will be ok you are half way. Stay strong and stay on here it really helps. Xxxx",
