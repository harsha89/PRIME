      "Content": "Hi Sim,  So sorry to hear you have been diagnosed. Yes it is perfectly normal to feel scared. I didn't read all the leaflets for quite a while, i found it too overwhelming. Read them when you feel ready as it is a lot to take in. I looked at it as i was glad to have the surgery so that i didn't have cancer.  Are you having any other treatment or is that to be decided still? x PS the ladies on here are great support, i wish i had come on here at the beginning as its sometimes difficult to talk to family and friends. ",

I feel elated to be able to start living a 'normal' as they put it life again. Even tho i still have to have the herceptin, and i hate needles, hopefully this won't be too much of a pain every 3 wks. Good luck to all the ladies (and men) out there who are either beginning or part through their journey. You can do it and kick cancers butt! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jean,  I read your message and feel exactly the same when people say 'how brave i am' I definately don't feel brave and just have to get on with it, it's not a choice you have to be brave. Thinking positively though does help so make sure you have good friends and family there for you to help when times get tough.  I wish i had a £1 for everytime someone said 'but your hair will grow back' and i agree they wouldn't shave it off if they didn't have to. I had the cold cap for 2 chemo session because i was so scared of loosing my waste length hair that was my identity. Now, in hindsight, i wish i hadn't had it as the second session was so horrible for me and i can't erase that day. They advise cutting it shorter after the first session, which also prepared me a little. My hair did start coming out in large handfuls just after the second one tho, even though i made the choice to not have it again anyway. I decided the trauma of having to go through the cap again was far worse than loosing my hair. But it is a personal choice and you alone have to make that choice because there are some ladies who are fine on it. My hair thinned loads and by the 5th session, i looked like i had a comb over on the top and hair at the sides, so i decided it was going to be better and look better if i shaved it off. I also cut my hair even shorter the day before to make it better. My partner shaved it off and i found that it didn't look as bad as i thought. Also the pain from my scalp doesn't happen anymore now it is shaved. So if you do experience the soreness from your scalp, i would say that's the start of it coming out. Again it is a very personal choice of whether you shave it off or wait to see, you will know when the time comes what the best is to do. I decided to take control and shave it off as i got sick of finding my hair everywhere and it keep coming out. Now i am going to wait for it to come back, so i am in charge more.  I have a wig too, and decided to go for a completely different look as i was scared to have my hair cut when it was so long and also decided that as this is a life changing time to go through, i was a different person. The wigs are very good and no one unless i have said has guessed it wasn't my hair. If you do loose it or shave it off you may want to get a night cap too as your head is cold at night. I wear a hat most of the time at home and only tent to wear my wig when i need to go out and feel i need more confidence. I even named my wig to make it more tolerable and try to have a laugh as there is nothing i can do about it. It is a very scary time and you will get through it, just take each day at a time and do what you think is better for you and try not to do as i did and think too far ahead.  I can't say chemo has been a breeze but looking back now it has gone quickly. I have had 5 sessions and go in for my last one this Wed and finally feel like i can see a light at the end of the tunnel at last. I had to still have 17 days of radiotherapy to get through and i will be having herceptin for 6 - 12 months to so not looking forward to still having to go in and have needles in me, which i hate. But it is the start of getting rid of this horrible disease and fighting it. Chemo affects people differently, some get through with hardly any symptoms and some get more. Use the advise from nurses and this site as it will help. Only you know what you are going through so you need to act on that as and when. Again, take chemo one day at a time.  I wish you all the best and cry whenever you need to and don't bottle it up, brave comes out of the tears. You will be on a roller coaster for a while but remember there will be a stop you can get off and look back and feel stronger and a better person at the end and fight this. Use your friends that want to help, it has helped me a great deal having them around or just having a chat with different people and also strengthened some of my friendships and i have found some people who i thought were just girls i know, have been there for me and visited. Unfortunately, i also have some friends that i thought would be there for me more and they haven't but it shows who your true friends are. It has also helped that i have a wonderful partner who has been there for me all the way through, even after i have snapped at him lol. Not everyone will react how you think, so just take that in your stride, no one understands until they have been through it. Reading some of the posts on here have helped me as everyone is in the same boat.  Take care and keep updating as it may help to off load xx",

A lady who was having chemo at the same time as me didn't put any on. Also i used to run alot so that was also part of it. Don't worry about weight gain tho, they consider it good as your body goes through a lot through chemo. hope this helps x",

      "Content": "Congrats Anne-Marie on your first graduation, feels good doesn't it to start to feel a tad normal. I had a lumpectomy last Oct/Nov, 6xchemo (FEC) and 17 sessions of rads......finished my rad on 8th May altho still on herceptin for a yr. I remember the first shop after my last chemo, when i started to feel better. I was standing in the pop isle and realised i didn't need the fizzy orange pop that i had to drink through chemo as i couldn't taste anything. It's sometimes the smallest things that you notice. I remember nearly jumping for joy in Asda when i remembered i didn't have to go again, but didn't as i may have go some funny looks.  All the best with your Rads. For me personally, i found it a walk in the park compared to chemo. i did have some soreness and tiredness but nothing like chemo. Keep applying the cream that the nurses recommend, even if there is no soreness, as i believe it's what helped me.  Remember to take it easy tho with rads, they can make you very tired and sometimes it comes on after you have finished, so don't overdo it. Take some 'me' times still while you are still going through it.  Wishing you a speedy and comfortable ride :) xx",

      "Content": "Hi there, I got a flu jab a week before starting chemo, i asked the nurse if it would benefit me as it was going into winter and she said yes. I too started with the cold cap, but found it too painful on the second one and my hair started to come out in handful and was very sore, so i decided not to have it again. I had the second one in Dec and didnt shave my hair off until about end of Feb, altho in hinsight, wish i'd done earlier. Being in control and shaving it off, was far more liberating than watching it come out and having the soreness. It is a personal choice though, as at the beginning i was devistated that i was loosing my lovely long hair. When the time came, i couldnt wait for it to go as it looked better than the comb over i had from the thinning. I didnt get my wig until about Jan when i thought my hair was coming out too much, so i got prepared. Also plenty of hats and scarves. I also asked if i could take multi vitamins too, they said yes, but you need to check incase you can't with you chemo as it differs. I also juiced regularly as i wasnt eating enough fruit and veg as i didnt fancy it. Pineapple worked for me too, and i found on the last few sessions when water tasted 'tinny' that fizzy pop helped, but again its a personal choice to try out. I didnt loose any nails, so cant help on that, I was on FEC so not sure if you do lose them or if i was lucky. I had constipation from the sickness pills, so make sure they give you something to be prepared. Plenty of rest taking it easy. I agree with other comments to about keeping away from people with colds etc, i avoided most people, and had a scarf and gloves on when i went out, if i could, but it was wintertime. I carried anti bacteria wash with me also whereever i went. I was lucky and didnt get any infections, otherthan a cold after my second operation for clear margins. I used Holland and Barratt natural Rock Salt deodrant when having radiotherapy and E45 cream, but i think you should ask you nurses when having it as some say different things, so best to check this out. i was told to use Aloe Vera by someone but the nurses said no when i asked. Wishing you all the best on your journey, it is do-able and you will soon see a light at the end of the tunnel. take care Jane x",

I had this in April this yr and it is still going strong. Ask your nurses though first as i dont want to give you the wrong information. Hope you get it sorted though.

I too have just had it comfirmed that my hot flushes/cold shivers aren't in vain as it has sent me through early menapause too. I was told by my oncologist doctor to take evening primrose capsules to help. I have been taking then and altho i still am having the hot flushes, they sometimes get let so not really sure if its helping or not. I am shocked though some of Holland and Barratt having osetrogen in their vit tablets. I asked the doctors about taking vit tablets and no one warned me about Holland and Barratt tablets, so i will have to check when i get home as i have been having them since the start. I would check the information with her oncologist doctor though or one of the nurses incase you get the wrong information. Everyone is different so i always think the doctors are the best to try. Hope this helps and you mom gets some relief! as i am going through the same at the moment, and got woke up last night by it, i sympathise with her. Good luck and if you get any good advise, please share.  ",

I was in a similar situation but my salary was only cut by 25%, but its still a struggle to live on. My advise to you would be to talk to one of the advisers on Macmillian, they should be able to help and advise you as to what or if you will be entitled to any help.
