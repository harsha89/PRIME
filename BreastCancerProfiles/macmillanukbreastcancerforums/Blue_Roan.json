      "Content": "Hello! I totally agree with everyone. Cancer is a very personal and unique experience for all of us. I write my blog for myself in the first instance... and for others second. In answer to your question about how my friends and family reacted to it and feel about it... Well... they love it. I didn't want to put constant updates on Facebook about how I was doing. It's not nice to see updates about negative things like hair loss and bloody noses on facebook so I chose to do that in my blog. I told everyone that if they wanted to know how I was doing then they could read it. Then it was their choice to look or not. I had some pretty major issues with my best friend during chemo and I wrote openly about it. I knew that I wasn't ever writing things that she didn't know about beforehand though. For example if I wrote about being pissed off that she just turned up at my house, when I'd asked her not too. She knew I was pissed off when she did it, so it was no surprise to hear about it when she read my blog, if that makes sense? I never used it to communicate with her or anyone else that I was pissed off or upset. That's not the right way around, to go about voicing these things. In the main I used my blog to document my 'experience' of cancer and chemotherapy. I wanted to keep track of what I was doing with my nutrition to help fight the side effects and to compare that to my blood tests. It helped me to improve my quality of life whilst going through chemotherapy. That's also why you'll see so many blood charts inserted throughout my blog. I see this as a full time job and each time I have a blood test it's like a little business review to see how I'm doing and figure out where I can make improvements. I'm very private too believe it or not. So I didn't include a lot of things that were happening in my life. Now and then I did. But in the main I kept it to chemo and my feelings and experiences. I got cancer for a reason. I know I cant go back to living life like I did before cancer, because it may just come back if I don't change. Things needed to change and they have. Cancer is a terrifying thing. But if you go into it and keep up with a positive attitude and see things in a good light, it really helps. I am happier and healthier now than I've been in my life. I love life now. I love myself now too. It's not all bad!! Check out my blog page called Silver Linings. There are a lot of other peoples 'Silver Linings' on that page too that I collated from this site. Keep smiling and be strong. You are loved and we are all here to support you. Big Hugs Liz PS - I have surgery next Tuesday!! It's the last hurdle for me.... I blogged about it today. I feel better now. :) x",

It helped me to get things off my chest and gave me a purpose...to try and help others in my position by sharing my experience. When I was diagnosed I couldn't find any 'real' views or experiences that showed what chemo was going to be like. How to cope with hair loss and should I or shouldn't I, with nutrition. So many things. I hope my blog helps someone. It's not easy to go through this. Big hugs. Liz. Xxx",

      "Content": "I have just started a twelve week, weekly treatment of Taxol and I was very curious to find out how it works and if I can prevent any of the side effects through nutrition. ((I've recently managed to halt the reduction in my red blood cells and stopped myself from becoming Anaemic through my nutrition)) Paclitaxel is used extensively as a chemotherapeutic agent against a broad range of tumors but often leads to the early termination of treatment due to severe toxic side effects. I REALLY don't want to get any toxic side effects OR have to terminate my treatment because of it. SO...!! I've done a lot of research on Complementary Therapies For Chemo induced Peripheral Neuropathy - (pins and needles in hands and feet as well as increased sensitivity) as this is one side effect my Oncologist said I would probably get. I found out some interesting stuff on what to put into my body to help avoid these toxic side effects. I'll be doing this for the next twelve weeks of my remaining Taxol treatment. I've written about it in my blog this morning and included links to pages where I found the information. I thought some of you might also find it helpful? https://theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/today-chapter-9-chemo-round-5-march-5-2015-for-the-next-twelve-weeks/ Liz x",

It's well known for causing peripheral neuropathy, but I found some information that suggested if I take Glutamine powder twice a day, it significantly lowers the chances of getting it. Glutamin is one of the most common amino acids found in the body and chemo strips us of it. Most chemo patients are deficient in it. I take a heaped tablespoon of it morning and night and I also take a B vitamin as this helps with the nervous system. So far, so good. Lots more on nutrition in my blog, if it helps?

(same with B Vitamins)  I think that Glutamine combined with B vitamins (complex) is a good combination to repair cells and nerves. If you're suffering from it already, it can take up to 8 weeks of constant use for your body to start to show any signs of repair. But It's worth it for sure, if you're suffering. I get my Glutamine powder from BodyKind: http://www.bodykind.com/product/4214-LAMBERTS-L_Glutamine-Powder-500g.aspx One of those tubs lasts me about 3 weeks. I got my B vitamin complex supplement from Tesco's. :) Liz",

I had a mastectomy and lymph nodes removed 9 months ago and I finished my chemo injections 2 months ago. After surgery they couldn't find any cancer cells in the tissue they removed and I was officially declared cancer free. I couldn't believe it. But I had worked hard on getting my nutrition right in order to help my body function and heal and kill cancer cells. I wrote a blog about my journey which includes pages on my nutrition and one about how I got through Chemo by doing things for myself every day. Simple things like drinking water and eating prunes. :) Lots of other stuff too - including 'Juicing'. If you want to take a look - my blog is here: www.theartofsuffering.wordpress.com I started to exercise 2 months after my surgery. Just walking for 5 or 10 minutes at first... but gradually building up and building up. It's now 9 months post surgery and just 2 months following the last of my chemo injections. Incredibly I am now ranked the fastest woman in Great Britain, over 100 meters, on the Concept 2 Ski Erg, and ranked 6th fastest woman in the World in my age group!! I'm 45. I continue my daily quest to eat right and exercise daily. The fatigue that chemo brought is still with me to a degree but is getting better and better. So stick with it ladies... it's a long road but if you treat your body right it will reward you with energy and performance. Not only that... but I have just completed my application to go onto Bear Grylls, The Island - TV show!! Watch my application / audition video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDKlQwDj3xU We can do anything if we put our minds to it, right?! :) Big hugs and lots of love. Liz x x x",

Also, no one seemed to want to commit one way or the other about the benefits of nutrition, so I have been researching it non stop!

      "Content": "Just like me - you are entitled to your opinion. I never professed to be an expert. I am simply sharing things I've found to be helpful to my body during chemo in hope that it may help someone else. I also never said anyone had to do what I'm doing, which you imply is what I'm saying. I'm not. Chemo is a time when I have little to no immune system. This is why I bleach and rinse my sink before I use it to clean my fruit and vegetables with a diluted vinegar solution - to kill bacteria. Simple. I certainly don't want to soak my fruit in a sink where I've just washed my cats food bowl out. But maybe you don't mind that sort of bacteria? I drink filtered and boiled water to put the purest form of water into my body that I can possibly get. My liver is already trying to deal with the toxic chemicals of chemo, so why give it extra work filtering water? The water in my area is extremely hard and I don't want that in my body. I never said you couldn't drink tap water. I never said it wasn't safe.  Please don't imply that I'm telling people tap water isn't safe. I am not. it can be made even purer, and that's what I'm trying to do. As for bathing twice a day - It's not that I 'believe' I need to do it - It is 'advised' in the Neutrophil leaflet that the NHS put out about general cleanliness during our time on chemo when our bodies cannot deal with bacteria. Maybe you missed out on getting that one? Dark Chocolate has angeogenic properties that are said to be good for helping to shrink tumours. If you don't know what it is, look it up, or watch the Ted Talk link I provided. Eating plain dark chocolate is far better than eating a crunchy bar or twix that's loaded with artificial flavours and god knows what else. I'm sure your liver will enjoy trying to process those. If that's what floats your boat, then you go ahead and do that... and leave me to do my thing. I'm not judging you, as you are me. Nutrition is the only weapon I have to fight off infections and the possibility of neutropenia. I have been lucky that I haven't suffered these kinds of things and I firmly believe my nutrition and practices in cleanliness have played a big part in protecting me so far. Buy hey...Good luck with your infections and I sincerely hope you don't have to have a blood transfusion from your neutropenia. Like you said... I too, need to save my energy for walks; so I wont be replying to any more of your rants. I wish you well too. Bye!  :)  ",

      "Content": "Throughout my chemotherapy (which is still ongoing) I have been quite obsessed with nutrition. I use specific things to help me avoid the side effects chemo brings, as well as to keep my immune system strong and try to stop myself from becoming anaemic and fatigued (if that's possible during chemo!).  :) I've been through 3 months of EC treatment and now I'm on a weekly chemo session of Taxol (Paclitaxol) for 12 weeks. I'm half way through this, as of today ((little jump for joy and a big Yippeee!!)). During chemo, I've found nutrition to be of the utmost importance. Every week I seem to be tweaking what I do. My blood tells me if it's working or not and more times than not - the things I do always have a positive effect. As my blog is becoming quite big, I thought I'd write a specific page about what I'm doing right now. It might help others to avoid side effects. So far (touch wood) I have not felt nauseous or been sick. I've only suffered a sore mouth a few times and that was only really overnight on both occasions. I haven't had constipation, gotten sick (colds etc) or had any infections or high temperatures. The only things I've suffered with is shortness of breath and feeling fatigued from low red blood cells - this is normal. This stuff is relevant to me... but I thought it might help someone else too... so here it is people! I'm happy to answer any questions and I really hope it helps someone else. :) x https://theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/nutrition-version-3-april-2015/ Keep smiling.xxx",

      "Content": "It's been a long journey... but I finally had a full mastectomy of my right breast and lymph node clearance. Two weeks ago my surgeon said that the lab could not find any cancer cells in the tissue that was removed. She said it was rare at this stage of cancer and that I fell into just 15% of all of her patients over the years. I put my great results down to all the hard work I put in daily with great nutrition. It certainly gave me a better quality of life throughout chemo. Details of my nutrition regime and my mastectomy story are here: https://theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/?p=1405&preview=true&preview_id=1405 Lots of love to you all. Liz x x x ",

So I've been writing about it as it happens with pictures. I included things about my hair loss and nutrition and good things that came from having cancer. I managed to beat it and now I have 3 months to get back to fitness before going back to work in January. It might help you to take a look?  The blog is: www.theartofsuffering.wordpress.com Big Hugs.

      "Content": "I went to have a heart scan a few days ago and the nurse started asking me questions about my chemotherapy. I was a little confused as to why she was asking me until she revealed that her 55 year old mother had just been diagnosed with stage 4 liver and bone cancer. My jaw dropped. Poor thing!! Her mother had just started EC chemo and was suffering from a lot of side effects including constipation and acid reflux as well as nausea. The nurse had no idea that chemo stripped the gut of it's cells and that was why her mother was suffering from acid reflux. Her poor mother was blaming good old dad for feeding her the wrong food!! She was also confused about being constipated. Of course that's what the drugs do to you. The nurse was shocked that 'they' had just given her mother chemo and not told her about any of these things or HOW to help herself post chemo. The nurse said each time her mother complained, she resorted to Googling it for some help, but rarely found anything useful. I felt so sorry for her. I've seen some posts on here about Chemo Survival and I've even written one myself, on my blog to help people. I gave my nurse the web page address and I really hope I have helped her mom in some small way. If anyone else wants to take a look, here is the link to the page: https://www.theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/chemo-essentials/ Lots of Love people! Onwards and upwards. xxxx",

I drink 3 to 4 litres of water a day and I think the cocount water helps to replenish electrolytes too.  Well done to you too. It's great to hear from a like minded person. :) Liz x",

      "Content": "This morning I went for my 3rd of 12 Taxol treatments and got my weekly blood test results back. ((I am 15 weeks into my chemo treatment - I had 12 weeks of EC to start with and now I'm on Taxol for the next 10 weeks)) Last week, all of my blood levels had taken a big hit and were dropping considerably. So much, that I thought I would probably be anaemic and have zero immune system (or be told to have a break from Chemo) before the end of the 12 week treatment. I work hard on my nutrition and when I get my blood test results I work on areas that need improvement. Last week I made changes to my diet to improve my immune system in particular and I was gobsmacked to see the massive improvements in my blood in just one week with the new changes. Of course I don't know if this is just a 'blip' or if my immune system and red blood cells will continue to rise into the normal range or not. But I thought this was definetly worth sharing in case others wanted to try this to help themselves.... Here is a link to my blog page detailing chemo last week (showing the changes I made to my diet) and this weeks chemo. I chart my blood and include these charts in my blog. I know it's very sad!! But it helps ME... so I don't care. :D  https://theartofsuffering.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/today-chapter-9-chemo-round-5-march-5-2015-for-the-next-twelve-weeks/ Keep smiling people!!
