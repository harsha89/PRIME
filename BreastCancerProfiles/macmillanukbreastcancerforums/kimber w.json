      "Content": "so i have finally finished my 6 cycle course of chemo on 4th December (Fec-T) and since August I have gained 30kgs (66lbs or 4.7 stone), I used to be pretty active and healthy food wise but each session hit harder and fatigue go worse. So all the healthy food preparations I used to do all fell by the wayside when I lost all energy...and it all went downhill from there Now I am finished and completely plagued by the non-stop fatigue but I can't afford to gain any more weight, as I still have to get through a double mastectomy ( Jan 2018) and then radiotherapy before I even get a look in at reconstructive surgery. Now after the T in the Fec-T, I suffer severe back pain, pain in my legs, bones, joints, hands, feet coupled with the constant non stop fatigue. I know exercise is a long way off at the moment because of the above but I will cry if I have to keep gaining anymore weight.. Is there any meal plans people that have gained loads are using that have helped them lose? At this point I am desperate to try anything...after losing my hair....this weight gain has completely ruined all and any confidence I had...I hear people saying that after the last chemo they start to lose all the \"chemo weight\"...but there are a lot that say they just continued to gain...eugh!! Any help is greatly appreciated ",

      "Content": "hi Carolyn, Yes here in the UK we are told pretty zip..zero..ziltch....and then am told things as an after thought..like take headache tablet before a cold cap session and I may have survived the 10 minutes and more..but no they only told me about that after I had completely lost all my hair!! The same goes for exercise and healthy eating. As I used to do both when I had a lot more energy, now its a case of ready meals for me and my daughter as that is about all I have energy to do and even then by the time I sit down you would think I had run a 40 min marathon because I am so tired. I just about get up my 13 stairs and am already out of breath. Sadly I have the worst sweet tooth in the world, however I am trying to keep away from that as much as I can but its already too late and the weight is already gained.  I have purchased a treadmill this week to try and combat the walking as I can't go out in the cold as I currently am suffering with: Peripheral Neuropathy (Nerve Damage)  www.macmillan.org.uk/.../peripheral-neuropathy.html So I have to avoid going out in the cold right now, otherwise the pain in my hands a feet become completely overwhelming. ",

      "Content": "hi Sally I feel your pain with weight gain and how it affects us girls, as if getting Cancer, losing our hair and all the side-effects in between wasn't hard enough already right? We then have to deal with this to boot..! I have purchased a treadmill and hopefully will see some results from that. If you find anything that works PLEASE post here and let me know? And I will do the same Kimber x",
