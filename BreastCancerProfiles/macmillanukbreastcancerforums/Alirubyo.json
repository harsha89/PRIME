    "Content": "Hi, I have been at the point of giving up the chemo as the mouth ulcers were becoming unbearable.  I am now gargling with Gelclair 3 times a day, bicarbonate often, nystatin and also have a handy spray (from my dentist) called Benzydamine.  On this round of chemo the consultant suggested sucking ice cubes before, during and after treatment, and so far it seems to be having a positive effect.  Please speak with the staff in your clinic, anything is worth a try.
