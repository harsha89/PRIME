      "Content": "Hi, I am 33 years old and 30 weeks pregnant. Early December I was referred to the breast clinic for bleeding and inverted nipple, the doctor thought there was nothing to be worried about but \"just to be sure\"! I had my appointment the week before Christmas and the consultant said he didn't think there was anything to worry about but sent me for an ultrasound, again \"just to be sure\"! The sonographer found a mass in the milk duct and decided to do a core biopsy (3) and I've been back today for the results. I was told I have a B3 intraductal papilloma which they think is not cancer but due to the pregnancy it's hard to tell and would like to see me in June to allow for the birth and breast feeding. Despite the consultant being lovely, I found myself saying yes I was happy and left. But now I'm confused! What does this actually mean? Thanks",
