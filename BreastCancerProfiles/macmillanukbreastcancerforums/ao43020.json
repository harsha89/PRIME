      "Content": "Perfectly put! And thank goodness I'm not the only one whose hair (if I can call it that) is growing back like afro candyfloss with intermittent bald patches.  The fear of not getting your hair back is real.  I wonder if I'll ever be able to ditch the wig entirely.  I went to Portugal last week, didn't take the wig because it was far too hot and felt about as feminine and attractive as Les Dawson.  It's 12 months since my chemo finished and 15 months since the first half of it finished and it's meant to start growing back from then :-(",

      "Content": "I've been saying this since I first saw this campaign. I had breast cancer last year and the last thing I want people (women especially) to do is to needlessly shave all their hair off. There are MANY more ways to raise money than such an act. I'm not criticising, I don't want to sound unkind. I just don't want people shaving their hair off in the name of charity. Hang onto it because there may come a day when chemo takes it from you. All said with respect to those who are raising money this way but please, I'd rather you didn't feel the need to do this.",

      "Content": "I agree with you, I think the way the adverts show the happy smiling people shaving their hair off with gay abandon is quite condescending to those people who have lost their hair through chemo.  We lose all our hair, our eyebrows, eyelashes, nasal hair, everything.....and it doesn't just grow back as it would if you shaved it off.  I really don't like this campaign at all. xxx",
