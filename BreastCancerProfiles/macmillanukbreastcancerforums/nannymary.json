I had a lumpectomy and auxiliary node clearance, then 6 rounds of Fec-T and 25 sessions of radio therapy. I will soon be coming up on my 2 year review. I' not going to pretend it was easy because it was damn hard but I'm out the other side and feeling good. I'm back at work full time and will be heading off on Tuesday to Italy for a holiday, I'm so looking forward to getting away. I joined weight watchers last October reached my gold last month with almost two stone off! I don't like heights but my husband would like to go on a cable car ride when we're away and I'm determined to do it, I got through last year so should be able to go up in a cable car!!!!! There is life after Cancer and we are all here to prove that. God bless ",

She has never asked me how I am and today she mentioned another sister who i haven't seen since before my diagnosis And I said this today. Sister number 2 is just off the phone telling me if I have a problem with her I need to speak directly to her. I told her I had no problem how could I have when I've had no contact with her. She began to tell me that she has health problems, before she got into any details I asked her if she had cancer. She, thankfully, said no and went on to say I'm not the first to have it and I won't be the last. I was dumbfounded at the coldness of that remark and hung up on her. I have barred her number from my phone because I don't want anything to do with anyone who has that callous attitude towards something as serious as cancer. I'm so damn angry I could scream i would only my poor knackered husband is sleeping on the chair. He will be livid when I tell him and when he wakes up we will verbally tear her apart without her knowing anything about it. my late father uses to say you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family how right he was but tonight I'm choosing to let go of my baby sister and block her completely from my life. Hope everyone is well tonight. ",

      "Content": "Hi to everyone out there. Today has been a big day for me, it's two years since I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. This dat two years ago my world was turned upside down. I was filled with horror, fear and dread. I didn't know what the future held or even if I had a future, I was also filled with guilt because I was putting my family through this trauma. The week after diagnosis I got my treatment plan lumpectomy, auxiliary node clearance, Fec T chemo x 6 and 25 radiotherapy sessions. My biggest worry then was I was going to loose my hair. I nearly put myself daft over that. When it did happen it wasn't so bad; it wasn't the most pleasant experience I've had but it wasn't the worst either. When I was going through chemo I would see people going about their daily lives and I would think to myself I'll never be like that again. Well I was wrong. I'm back at work full time and doing most of the things I did pre chemo. I have a full head of hair, my eyebrows and eyelashes are back and my nails have recovered. The human body is a wonderful machine, we've been poisoned to within an inch of our lives and then incenirited and our bodies recover. I've spent today celebrating life with my husband no alcohol involved but I had a lovely day. I'm sitting up in bed writing this because I want you all to know there is life after breast cancer. It's a tough journey but I and thousands of others are living proof that it is doable.   God Bless",

I went to a Macmillan Counsellor and was able to work through a lot of the stuff that was inside me. I have a wonderful husband and family but there were things I just couldn't talk to any of them about, I was worried I would hurt them, worry them, they would think I was crazy etc. I found it much easier talking to a stranger who listened without judging me and who didn't throw platitudes at me or try to fix me. She was patient and supplied tissue after tissue when I needed them. I would highly recommend you give it a go. Please keep in touch everyone on here has been on a similar journey, some of us have taken different routes but then end game for all of is the same, survival. Having a cancer diagnosis is not just a physical thing it hits every part of your being, for me the psychological and emotional effects lasted much longer than the pain of surgery, chemo and radiotherapy. There is no need to suffer the pain you must be feeling. Massive hugs.",

      "Content": "Hi daisyteabag I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer on 8th November 2013. I finished my treatment a week ago today and I feel on top of the world. I knew nothing about triple negative prior to diagnosis in fact prior to this entering my world I thought breast cancer was breast cancer, I didn't know there were different types. During my treatment I sometimes worried that there was no drug for me to help keep the cancer at bay and worried that it would come back. I didn't lose all my hair during chemo, I always had roughly a number 1 on top and I worried that the chemo hadn't done its job properly. I had to have my second two doses of dositaxel reduced to 75% and I worried that I hadn't been given enough for it to work. I worried that I would never get back to normal, to be honest I worried about everything. A few days before my radiotherapy ended I met with one of the doctors and had the opportunity to discuss some of my fears with her. She looked me straight in the eye and said \"it did it's job, you got enough\". I was so relieved I could have cried. We then talked about triple negative, something I had avoided because I was scared of what I might hear. Again she looked me straight in the eye and said \"we know triple negative responds extremely well to chemo\". I could have kissed her but that would have been very inappropriate! I felt a Hugh burden lift from me and since then I have decided to adopt a positive frame of mind. I spent months worrying and it got me absolutely no-where. You are going to hear all sorts of negatives about triple negative but any cancer can come back at any time, the good thing is we are being looked after by a team of experts. I've decided I'm going to do my very best enjoy my life as best I can and try to turn a negative into a positive. care",

The aftercare in this neck of the woods is very different from across the water in that, in my case, it doesn't exist. To be fair to the NHS I'm on self directed aftercare which means if I'm worried about anything I ring them and queue jump but that's it. I'm very lucky because my GP is excellent and nothing is too much trouble for her. If you ring the Oncologist's secretary and insist on an appointment you should get one. By the way the yearly mammograms are from the date of diagnosis, I'm due my second one about now but haven't had an appointment sent out yet!!!   Take care",

I have a good covering of my own hair but it was quite grey at the front, bad enough having very short hair but I wasn't ready to go grey just yet. I bought a henna dye from my local health food shop and with the help of my husband I dyed it on Saturday. We'll grey was bad but mulberry was worse, it looked like I'd dipped my head in diluted blueberry juice. On Sunday I bought olia hair colour, it has no ammonia and turned out well. I decided to bite the bullet yesterday and go out on my own. I drove through the town but lost my nerve and went to a shopping centre a few miles out of town. The sun didn't fall out of the sky and people didn't turn and run in horror. I have to go out again today and while I'm nervous I'm going to do it but I won't be in my home town until either my husband or daughters can come with me but this is a start. I have my eyelashes back and most if my eyebrows. They just need to thicken up a bit more but I've become a dab hand with a pencil. My finger nails are recovering well, can't say the same for my toes but I'll get there. I was thinking the other day about how great a machine the human body is, mine was sliced, poisoned and incinerated and it has fought back and seems to be doing good. Time to go wish me luck.",

That was as much as I could cope with. I still don't want to know statistics or any of the negatives surrounding this type of cancer. My attitude is \"what good will it do me, what would I do with the information, it's of no use to me. I have got through treatment and I'm trying to get on with my life and take each day as it comes. I'm back to work 3 days a week, my hair is growing back well, I have nails on my fingers and toes, I can eat what I want and actually taste it and I am surrounded by people who care about me. I've ditched those who don't and all things considered life is good. For me that's ll I need for now. If cancer returns, and please God it won't, I will deal with as best I can but I refusee to live my life in the \"what if\".  This is has worked for me it may not work for everyone. You asked if anyone had anyone had anything positive to say about TNBC well at the end of my radiotherapy the doctor told me TNBC responds to chemo. I have clung to that and will continue to do so.  I sincerely hope hope all goes well for you and as Bongo said stay away from google. ",
