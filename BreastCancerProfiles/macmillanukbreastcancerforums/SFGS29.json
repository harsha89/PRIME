It\u2019s so so hard to switch off after all this. I am so sensitive to every twinge and pain now then when I think about it I feel like the twinges and pains get worse.

I have been getting a pain in my left shoulder and the side of my next (right side) which gets worst at night.  Has anyone else had these symptoms? I want to let my oncologist know and maybe ask for a scan or something. They didn\u2019t seem worried last time I mentioned it. Maybe it\u2019s a bit of health anxiety kicking in, but it\u2019s on my mind all the time, especially at night as that\u2019s when it\u2019s painful most. Is the best thing to do call my BCN?

I would say it took about 5 weeks from my op to feel that the use of my arm was beginning to feel normal again.  I had worries like you during the healing process. I had a heavy feeling all of the time under my arm pit and I felt very firm around the site of where the lump was removed. I ended up going to see my GP as I was getting back really anxious, she said I might have a mild infection and gave antibiotics. I think she was more covering all bases Incase. They really worked so I must have had something mild to shift as the pain went.  It is really important to do your exercises during this time. How are you getting on with them?  Do you know how many lymph nodes were removed? It\u2019s still early days for you, don\u2019t get down, you will come out of the other side. I don\u2019t think a lumpectomy is a minor op at all. It\u2019s a lot to go through and if anything all the waiting around in between makes it worse too.  Take care x",
