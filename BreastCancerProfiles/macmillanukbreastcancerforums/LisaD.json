    "Content": "Hi Ann I'm so sorry you have received so much information, however so little in terms of herping you through. My mother and I are helping my father through liver cancer and even though we were with him at every appointment, ofter we had so many questions to ourselves about what had and hadn't been said. People here are so kind and have so much experience that i found just reading through their stories and experiences so very helpful. Help, support and advice is always available so i wish you well, hope everything goes well over the next few weeks and don't feel lonely, come here whenever you need to. Lisa XXX",
