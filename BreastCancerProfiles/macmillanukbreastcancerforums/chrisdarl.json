      "Content": "Hi Tracey I had a TRAM recon which is using the muscle and tummy fat.  I was in bed for the first two days(in hospital a week as well) and am still not back to work.  I had it done in Aug of last year.  I don't won't to worry you as part of the reason I'm not back is trying to get my head round the whole cancer thing as everything happened so quickly at the start. The nurse is right in that it will take around three months recovery and depending on your job, you may be off for longer than you wanted to be. Hope that is some help?",

      "Content": "Hi there You are slightly the wrong way round, the TRAM(I've had it in Aug) is the one where they use muscle and fat still all attached and feed it under the skin and restitch it into place as the new breast.  It is indeed a hip to hip incision but I believe that part is the same for the DIEP where no muscle, just fat is used.  Not sure which is the longer recovery but all I can say having had the TRAM is that some five months later I am still not back to work and still have the tightness and discomfort around the tummy area.  Very pleased with the look of the new breast I hasten to add. Hope this clears some confusion?",

They don't do that stats thing over here unfortunately but then maybe they do when you get passed onto the oncology team.  I never had that because of no further treatment which was a shame as I wanted to hear the stats(I know not everyone does), There is more than one hospital but for now I'm going to content myself(or try) with the knowledge that they know what they're doing.  I shall be beating the GP's door down if I feel anything new or worrying though.

My dilemma is that they are offering me no further treatment!  No radio or chemo.  Part of me is delighted but part of me is terrified.  I feel that I wanted even radio as a reassurance.  Whilst I know that they are the experts I feel now that I've been discharged from the whole breast cancer thing with hormone therapy and left to sink or swim!   I know I should be grateful but why don't I feel grateful? Why do I spend hours worrying about not feeling completely cured?  I'm sorry if I sound silly compared to what a lot of you are going through on the site and I do really feel for you... Chris",

Could it be scar tissue, does scar tissue cause sharp pains?   Would love to hear if anyone else has had pain two years post off and should I rush to the doctors?  if I go to the GP it makes it seem more worrying..

Although one is usually surrounded by relatives and friends throughout this, no one truly understands the whole thing.  My relatives and friends want the old me back now that I've had my surgery and recovering.  It's so hard to explain to them that the old me is gone and they and I have to get used to the new me.  I am still so emotionally fragile but don't want to burden them.  I visited my two sisters last week and they both never mentioned the whole cancer thing.  It was like the elephant in the room, don't talk about it and it never happened.  Not that I want to drone on about it but I need to talk about it a bit. I'm waiting for counselling with the lovely Macmillan people so hopefully that'll help me sort a few things out in my mind.

Ask your GP, it's always worth asking.  I am going to sit on it(literally!) for another couple of months as i was told that on the Letrozole I would be called for a scan in the first twelve months.  Do you think that is the same type of bone scan that can eliminate secondaries?  Is that where your ostea problem was diagnosed? Good luck with your GP",

Appt got quickly and they told me after the biopsy that it was cancer.  Completely broke down as my GP after examining me had said she didn't think it was concerning...had a lumpectomy and node removal and when I went back for the results there was good and bad news.  Good in that the lump had clear margins and nodes but bad in that when the surgeon was in she'd seen a nodule and took it out along with other tissue well away from the original lump and he came to early cancerous DCIS.  I couldn't believe that I'd been unlucky enough to have two separate sorts of cancer in the same breast.  I am waiting until thurs once they've had their mutil disp team meeting to discuss and have been told to consider a mastectomy.  I was shocked to hear this(as anyone would be) and initially told myself that I wouldn't go ahead with it.   I'm only having radio btw, no chemo which I'm relieved about.  I have come round to the idea of a mastectomy and am now considering it seriously.  I am a worrier, and I shall feel like my breast is a ticking time bomb.  I know they monitor you afterwards but I am concerned even with this as my original lump wasn't picked out on a routine mamo. It's good to hear that you are recovering well from the operation.  And you are right in what you say, people, men included, will take you as they find you.  No one gets to our age without some kind of war wound or scarring.  I am divorced with a 12yr old son and recently in a new relationship with a lovely man and he is taking this well, too well I sometimes think.  He was remarkably calm about the idea of a mastectomy, far more than I was. He lives an hour away so I am trying to be a bit more independent and taking myself to the appointments and keeping the important ones for when I need someone. Please keep in touch, this group is amazing and I've only been on it for a few days but I am a big talker! Chris",

My GP changed my presription a few months ago to your one and it very quickly made me miserable and constantly nauseous, awful!  Rang GP and said couldn't continue with this brand and they changed me back.  I have just collected my new prescription and yet again they have given me the Teva brand of Anestrole.  I spoke to the pharmacist about it and she said the drug i was on is made my Astro Zeneca and is around 15 times the price of this one!  Hence why they keep trying to push me onto this one. I have decided to give it one more go as I want to be sure it was the drug causing the side effects then if is was I'll be better armed to tackle the GP again. Kate I was given hormone pessaries to counteract the dryness(my cancer was highly hormone receptive) but my GP said it was ok to take them.  I haven't dared try them yet as i really want a definitive answer as to whether it's safe to take them.  My consultant is a dragon who says no to everything so pointless asking her. Can you throw any light as to whether it would be ok to use them?  ",

I didn't have a CT at all.  My lump was very small, less then a cm.  I had a mammogram less then two years ago which was disappointing that it didn't pick it up but they said that it was probably because my lump is at the top of the breast and just outside the mammogram area.  I just went in and had the lumpectomy with margin and nodes removed.  Both the margin and nodes came back clear which was a huge relief but that's when she said she'd discovered the second cancer in an area far away from this lump but it is early stages of non invasive ductal in situ I think it's called. I have been sent away for a week while they discuss me at their meetings and I have to consider a mastectomy or more surgery.  The more I think about it, the more I am coming round to a mastectomy.  I will then have radiotherapy, no chemo and 5 yrs of hormone therapy.

I was diagnosed with breast cancer around a month ago and have had the wide local excision and sentinel node thingy.  I got clear margins and no node involvement which I was greatly pleased with but they had a hoke about and removed a nodule and other tissue and have found early changes in the cells showing ductal carinomal in situ which has freaked me a little!  Is it rare to have two forms of cancer going on at the same time in the same breast? I should say I'm 52 and healthy(well I thought so!).  They have discussed further surgery with me or to consider a mastectomy.  I was shocked at first but now think it may be better as I am a worrier and will always feel like the breast is a ticking time bomb.  But then what of the other breast? Is there anyone here who has had similar?  I am having radiotherapy only and tamoxifen as the main lump(under a cm) is estrogen positive.

The lumpectomy wasn't for ductal, just plain old common invasive but it was only due to the surgeon hoking about and seeing a suspicious looking nodule further away from the isolated lump that she took tissue out.  I appear to have two sorts going on in the one breast(not like me to be different, much!)  She said it was very early cell changes indicating that and that it would take years to break out and become invasive.  They seem happy enough with the small lump not to need chemo but it still freaks me out that there may have been a few stray cancer cells circulating round me as we speak.  She said I don't need an MRI scan or bone scan, just radio.   I need to ask my nurse on thurs about this HER thingy as I haven't been told.  All I've been told is the main lump is stage on, grade 2 and the DCIS is very early cell changes.   My nodes were all clear for which I'm very thankful.  I have been told I'll be on Tamoxifen which confuses me slightly as I am 52 and i thought you were only on it if you were pre menospausal?  I have no idea where I am as I was happily on HRT for the last 5 years(hindsight,eh?)

I am 52 and they did a hormone profile(I'd been on HRT prior to discovering the cancer) and found me to be post menopausal and haven't had a period so that's all good.  I do get awful hot flushes as well but I got those after coming off the HRT and they have continued since June.  Again they are not the awful ones that involve night sweats thankfully.

My new man is so far being lovely about it all but I know the realities are not quite what you think they're going to be.  I am very open about my body but suspect this will change after the op and am frightened that it may put him off sex etc.   He is nearly being too good about coping with it all am am worried that the shock will settle in with both of us once I've had the op. Should I think about trying to find after photos to show him or would that be difficult?  I can't have the reconstruction straight away as I'm having radio. Chris",

      "Content": "Hi there I just joined the group yesterday and although I can't really help much, felt the need to reply.  I am in a sort of similar situation to you only I am 52yrs old.  I had surgery, lumpectomy with clear margins and clear nodes but they discovered a second type of cancer early cells, ductal carninoma in situ.  I have been told they are discussing me at a meeting but to prepare for a mastectomy. Having had surgery already i was confident that it was sorted but then that's cancer for you, a mind of it's own. You are younger but I would be guided by the surgeons.  They are the experts and you have to give them the credit that they know what they're doing.  They would not have suggested a mastectomy lightly.   This whole thing is a scary thing and I know that you feel like you've entered an alien world that is nothing to do with you.  You are not alone feeling like that. I know I haven't been much help but talk to your breast care nurses as well, they are very genned up on it all. Best of luck Chris",

I felt like that after reading other peoples experiences as well but we are all going through the same disease just different strains of it. Hope all goes well tomorrow for you. Chris",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy I was like you and needed no further treatment.  I had a small lump, lumpectomy where a second lump was found and then advised to go for a mastectomy.  Good job as a third small lump was discovered after this.  All lumps were grade 2 and less then a cm.  No nodal speed so was told after the multi discip meeting that no further treatment was needed.  I was a bit shocked as I nearly would've preferred radiotherapy as a precaution afterwards.  But it was explained that they would not put me through it if I didn't need it. You have to trust that they know what they're doing and not only that, it is discussed with a number of experts, not just the surgeon. I don't think they're are any specific questions to ask apart from asking them to go into detail why no further treatment is required. All the best.",
