      "Content": "Hi all  Thought I would post about dying hair if anyone is looking for information. I had my last fec 29th Feb. As I had a few greys I needed to colour it. I bought Naturtint from Holland & Barrat. £9.99 each. I coloured it 9 weeks after chemo when I had about 1/2\". It has worked brilliantly and makes your hair lovely and soft and shiny. It lasts 3 - 4 weeks. Word of warning though,it comes out a lot darker then it says on the pack so I would suggest buying one shade lighter. Good luck everyone Ellen",

      "Content": "cerijune There always seems to me to be a lot of good advice from sufferers on here. They all know how you are feeling so please don't feel alone. I can't really put into words to describe what it is like to cope with how you are feeling and the coming months but you DO cope. Somehow we all do. I still can't quite believe that I'm having it myself though this is my second time in 9 years and I only have one more to go.It's a surreal feeling. It has seemed to take so long (my first one was 3rd Nov)now all of a sudden I'm nearing the end :) it's a great feeling and we all get there in the end. It is an acheivement in itself to have dealt with it. The only advice I will give you is don't keep quiet about any side effects and don't suffer in silence. The nurses are there to listen and to help. My first session was the worst and apart from being neutropenic every month the hospital have been great with giving me everything to cope with the side effects. And you do manage to have a life...even if you have to take things easy and not over do it. You will find a pattern emerge then you can plan things around it. Take each day as it comes and make the most of the good days. Good days make it all seem so much better and worth it all :) I never thought I would get through it either as I had a rather bad start but I have and you will too. Take care Ellen",

So I'm taking all that's thrown at me. I don't want it to happen again ! I've had a masectomy and 6 x fec75. Can't have radiotherapy as had it on the same side first time around. I'm not menopausal ( well before chemo I wasn't !) so I'm having Zoladex and Anastrozole. Hope it works this time. I had Tamoxifen last time but stopped it after 4 years. Maybe that's the reason of my recurrence. They don't seem to be able to tell me if ir's a new tumour or a recurrence so I will never know if it's because I stopped the Tamoxifen. Everyone is different as reacts differently so not everyone has side effects. But it must be worth it to prevent it coming back :) I'd say go for it...you can always change your mind instead of regretting it one day. Ellen x",

I'm in the same position as you. I previously had it in Jan 2003 and was diagnosed again in Sept 2011. Almost 9 years inbetween you don't expect it to return do you.I too had Tamoxifen in 2003 and came off it after 4 years. I wondered too if that's the reason it had returned but I have been assured by my oncologist that it shouldn't have made a difference. Aparently I only had a 4% chance of it returning. I completely understand how you are feeling. I felt it has been a bigger shock and even many months down the line it all seems so surreal. I didn't feel like this the first time. I think I have shut my emotions down to protect my feelings of fear that I am here again. Please don't feel that you are alone in this. Knowing there is someone in the same position is a comfort to me and I hope it will help you too. I don't feel so alone now. Please feel free to message me anytime Love Ellen x",

It caused severe pain in my hips and after 3 months it was changed to exemastane (aromacin). The pain should subside after 3 months but if it doesn't let your oncologist know and he might consider changing them to exemastane. The hip pain has subsided a little but the exemestane has now caused pain in my hands especially my thumbs. They are strapped up to stop them locking. Apparently a lot of women cannot tolerate anastrozole so they can easily change it. Hope this helps. Ellen",

      "Content": "Hi Mishka I just wanted to reply regarding your worry for your children My daughters were 11 and 14 when I was diagnosed 9 years ago and it troubled them deeply though they tried to hide it from me. Being strong for them does not mean not crying infront of them,it means being there to hold each others hands on the good and bad days and being open and honest with each other.As long as they have someone to confide in if they feel they don't want to trouble you then they will be ok.Maybe you could make a pact that you state if you are having a good day or a bad day and they can do the same.Or rate the day 1/10 and so on so everyone gets an idea without having to unleash your emotions.Then when you're having a good day and it's an 8/10 you can all make the most of it and enjoy without worrying.Noone feels under pressure to please or stifIe.I don't know if it would work for you but I've often done it and it seems to clear the air if nothing else. Now 9 years later I am going through it again and they are 20 and 23.They have become my absolute rocks and I don't know where I would be without them.These awful experiences we have gone through together have made them the special people that they are today.I am so proud of their support and love for me sometimes I don't feel worthy of it. P.S. I was diagnosed sept with recurrence and halfway through fec75 and finally beginning to realise that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.....the journey is a long and hard one but damn worth it :) good luck hun Ellen",

Unfortunately and inevitably I wasn't able to carry on with the pregnancy beacuse it would have delayed the treatment for too long and I had my daughters to think about. The reason I am telling you this is because it caused me to have panic and anxiety attacks too. I couldn't socialise and didn't work for 3 years. In the end it was too stressful and my partner left because he wanted kids more than anything else. Tamoxifen had put paid to that cos I would have been 45 by the time I had finished treatment. That was a wake up call, I dragged myself off to get a better job that I am missing big time at the moment and can't wait to get back to. But during that time I had panics about everything and never thought I would get over it but I did. This time around I knew what to expect. The biggest thing has been that it came back again after so long. I was in shock but I've dalt with that now and apart from having the bad chemo days I'm happier in myself Because I'm actually really proud of myself for dealing with it all much betetr than I thought. I've not admitted that til now and it feels good, :) Counts were 0.4 today but feeling bit better than yesterday which is a bit odd lol.

I  had bc in 2003 and was diagnosed again in sept so it was a bit of a shock to find myself here again. I had my first chemo 6 weeks ago and used the cold cap to no avail. I ended up neutropenic and hospitalised for 5 days where my hair started to disappear! So trying to cope with losing it has been the hardest thing as you may well know. I thought I was strong and not bothered but it hit me hard. Monday I cried so much,pulled myself together,cried some more etc etc. I've wrestled with shaving it off but knew I wasn't ready til yesterday !  Being hospitalised 3 times in the past 2 days because I was neutropenic again made me realise I only had one thing left that I could control so decided to take matters into my own hands. So today my great friend who has been through this palava herself came with her clippers. I let her make silly patterns in my hair,took a few pics and had a good gulp of wine. BEST thing I have done these past few months. We had such a giggle. I never dreamed I would feel this way about it and I have finally accepted it and survived another day :) I now have one boob, am bald but I have finally accepted this is just a journey that I WILL come out the other side a better person than ever. To all you ladies out there believe me please when I say that you can and will find the strength to cope and survive it because I have :) love and best wishes to you all x",

I was actually on a high when it was being shaved off and then worried it would hit me the next day and cry. But it didn't. I actually feel so relieved and have been sleeping better than I have in months. I refuse to cry about it cos it won't change anything and have to live with it for a few months. I've even had friends over and not worn anything on my head. I have a big lump on top but never mind eh, it will be covered again in a few months :) My daughters tell me to take my scarf off indoors which makes me feel better too. My head was itchy and had a rash but I have been using e45 itch relief which has worked for me. I do have a lovely wig similar to my own hair but I actually feel more comfortable with my head scarf or just a hat when I go out. I'll save the wig for if I go out for a meal or a drink but wearing it for a few hours I really don't like. I had a shock the other night though when i went into the kitchen at night with a bald head and turned the light on and went to the sink. Saw my reflection in the window and freaked out cos the blinds were open lol hope the neighbours didn't see me and my bald head shining ! haha Ellen xx",

I've got lansoprazole too and it works doesn't it. I'm on fec all the way through so I don't know much about taxotere. Hope it goes ok for you. Sorry I've moaned so much but I feel I've had no reprieve this time round and it's depressing to know I have to start again tomo already. Take care and good luck tomo x",

      "Content": "Hi Marilyn My story is similar to yours. Diagnosed 2003 then rediagnosed 2010 with no chemo the first time round. My head was terribly itchy and had a rash when it first started coming out but I used itch relief e45 which helped a lot. I've just had my 4th on Wed and finish 29th Feb hopefully. Something to make you laugh..........I put moisturiser on my head yesterday and found tiny pieces of hair on my palms....I cried to my daughter.....\"my hair is falling out\"....you should have seen the look on her face !!!!!!!! I've been bald for the last 6 weeks lol I couldn't stop laughing it was so silly of me... Good luck hun Ellen x",

I'm a bit obsessed with my bald head right now and have even taken to walking around the house with nothing on my head. Problem is I may forget and answer the door to someone...they may get a shock lol I look quite nice apart from the unicorn lump on the front of my head lol might paint it red for xmas as Rudolph's nose haha My daughter has been throwing up all morning and the hospital advised me that she has to stay somewhere else for a couple of days as I am still neutropenic (0.4) Shame I can't look after my own daughter while she is ill but I could end up in hospital again if I haven't caught it already :( fingers crossed. Anyway I want to wish you all the best for tonight...put some good happy music on and enjoy your bubbly :) you could have noughts and crosses on your head or a xmas tree ! :D you go girl !!! Ellen x",

      "Content": "Thanks Ruby, don't cry cos I'm not anymore :) I didn't go into the menopause with tamoxifen,I had regular periods right the way through tho I had the symptoms like hell. So bad that I stopped taking them after 4 years. Maybe that's why it came back and I did wrong. So never stop the drugs hun :) First one I have ever missed was after my first chemo last month lol But hosp are waiting to do another scan on an ovarian cyst 10 days after my period ! so not sure what to do yet. Will call them next week and explain and they'll have to do it whenever...I'm NOT  likely to be pregnant anyhow !!!!  ;) xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Rich I'm glad you posted about this because it has reminded me to make a call tomorrow. Not many people know about a charity called 'look good feel better'. Look it up on line. You can see where in the country hospitals hold work shops for women like us. You get a 2 hour tuition to help you make the most of your looks and a goody bag of fabulous makeup to take home and it's all free. Most hospitals hold these on a monthly basis and I'm going to call and book mine tomorrow :) Wishing your mum well Take care  Ellen",
