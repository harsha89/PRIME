    "Content": "My heart bleeds for you. After a mastectomy and the works 9 years i got a second cancer in the other breast last summer. I was \"lucky\", it was unrelated to the first and of a different and less nasty type, so just had radio and another 5 year drug sentence.  It was the waiting for appointments, tests, results and treatment that was the worst and I voiced this at every opportunity but to no avail. I too cannot look at my body or bear anyone else seeing it.  So how do you get through? You do it because you have no choice. You are woman. You can do anything. You will survive. Some support just makes you feel worse. And you never forget those who were kind to you and those who just were not there for you.    ",
