      "Content": "Hi Elder I've had this for surgery on one of my shoulders, it's very good. It works brilliantly for pain relief plus it means they can use less of the general anaesthetic, which means you recover more quickly and is better for your body. Don't worry about it, wish I could have been offered it for my breast cancer surgeries too but now living in a different area so different hospital. Maggi xx",

      "Content": "Hi; I think at least part of feeling down is the effects of the GA, it takes me at least 6 days to clear it from my head (had experience of other surgeries before BC). Don't worry about feeling down, it's totally understandable and we all have good & bad days. After my WLE & SN removal my diagnosis was grade 3, & despite being told the lump was very small beforehand it turned out to be much larger with cancer cells in the lymphs, so you're very lucky. I'm waiting for axilliary clearance & chemo now, prob to be followed by Herceptin but I don't know if that will be at the same time as the chemo or rads yet. Good luck & much love to all xx                                                ",

      "Content": "Hi All I just wanted to let everyone know how good the 'Look good, feel better' session I attended this week was and to recommend them. They're open to any female cancer patient, and you can attend one up to a year after your treatment ends so it doesn't matter if you're not feeling well enough during treatment. These sessions are provided by a charity operated with support from many of the major perfumery/cosmetic companies & they also provide the volunteer make-up artists & consultants that attend each session. Each of us received a big goody bag containing full size products from many of the major companies, a full cleanse, tone & moisturise kit plus a full set of make-up to use during the session, and a fragrance. The advice & help given by the very sweet consultants during the session was completely product neutral too, no selling whatsoever. Our group was quite small & could have accommodated more people, and the lady running the session was keen to encourage us to spread the word, so do ask your breast nurse if this is available in your area. There's also a do-it-at-home kit you can get if you can't travel to a session.  We don't get many bright spots because of our cancers but this one's worth making the most of :-) Love & hugs to you all    ",

To be honest, although I was dreading the chemo, once it started I felt much more settled because the cancer had been removed and the treatment to clear what was left had begun. Chemo isn't pleasant but it is doable and much better than the alternative. Good luck with everything xx",

Try & think of questions & write them down, or take someone with you to ask them. I went completely blank but my lovely friend asked all the right things while I was blinking back tears.  You'll get through this, hugs, best wishes & keep us posted :-)   Maggie xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne 5 weeks sounds like it's outside of those NICE guidelines around cancer treatment but there's not much you can do if the hospital can't cope with demand. By the way, my oncologist said that the cold cap didn't really work for the 'T' part of the treatment so I didn't bother. Not everyone can tolerate the cold cap anyway, I saw a lady react very badly to it last week on her first session & she had to discontinue it. Take care & good luck xx",
