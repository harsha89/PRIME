      "Content": "Hi there  I went and saw my consultant who checked it out and said it felt like normal scar tissue . But because I was concerned he sent me for a ultrasound,  the radiologist confirmed it was only scar tissuewhich was normal for me.  So worth a phone call to the breast care nurses to make a appointment to put your mind at rest. hope this helps xx",
