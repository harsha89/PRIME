I really appreciate you sharing your experience and it gives me comfort to know that you have not had any adverse side effects......I hope this continues, as I hope I don't too. i start my first one tomorrow, and think if all goes well initially, fingers crossed I won't have any major side effects either. All the best for your continuing journey Uzumex",

      "Content": "hi everyone, I'm new to the site and working through my treatment.I'm due to have herceptin for her2 primary breast cancer in a few weeks and wondered if anyone had any info about their experiences on it. Also, I have been invited onto a clinical trial for a new drug called lapatinib which is being trialled on 8000 people worldwide and 400 in the uk. Has anyone been on this before and if so I'd love to hear of your experiences and any help in considering whether I go on the trial or stick to the herceptin. Decisions decisions decisions. Any help or response would be most appreciated and all the best to everyone out their on your journey through and with cancer. Best wishes Uzumex",

      "Content": "Hi Jayne, Thanks so much for your reply, and sharing with me your experience of herceptin. I am very glad it has gone all ok for you and hope it continues to do so. And thanks for your thoughts on the trial. If I go on the trial I will be in one of 4 strands. A herceptin only one, a herceptin 3months lapatinib 9 months, a combination of the two, or a lapatinib only one, all for a year. Hope that answers your question. I am still pondering on it and have another couple of weeks. I will check out the sources for info you suggested and have been trying to accumulate as much info and research stuff as possible to aid my deicision. Thanks again for replying and your support and all the very best to you on your continuing journey too. Take care Uzume xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jin, Thanks so much again for your reply and the info. Well after much deliberation and looking at so many bits of info about trials of lapatinib, I felt I had it all coming out of my ears......I eventually have plumped not to do the trial, just having herceptin, and the main reasons were,...wanting to go for the option that has the most research done on it already, i.e. feels safer..... wanting to not be up the hospital all the time on my days off fromwork to attend all the monitoring stuff........really not fancying diarohea.......and wanting to feel more like a human being getting on with my life, rather than a patient. I'd be really interested to hear how you are getting on with your decision process and offer any help/info I can further. Warmest wishes to you. Uzumex",
