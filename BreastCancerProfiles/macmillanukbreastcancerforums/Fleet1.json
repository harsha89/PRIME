      "Content": "I have been suffering from terrible anxiety attacks and it has really affected my confidence. Im normally very active running and fitness classes but after my 3rd chemo im just exhausted and have no appetite. My Dr has prescribed lorazepam which does help massively but im worried about taking too often so only take when Im desperate. I guess my anxiety is never feeling like myself again. Any advice or stories of comfort that it wont always be like this.",
