      "Content": "Thanks for your reply, I realised it would take longer than 1st operation but as I had returned to yoga and had about 85% movement back I would recover quicker after 2nd operation, however this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. 6 - 8 weeks seems an awful long time to be uncomfortable! But I am only 2 weeks post op so I will have to see how it goes. Sorry you are not able to drive as this forms part of our independence, hope you improve soon and are able to get back behind the wheel, I am hoping to return to driving in the next couple of weeks, it is my right side so no hand brake! I have tried all sorts of cushions, different sizes and shapes and they give relief for brief periods and then the sciatic nerve plays up. I am seeing my consultant on Friday for my results and treatment plan so will mention it to her. Pre bc I used to go for regular back massages to alleviate shoulder and back pain due to my desk job but no therapist will touch me at the moment. I am really missing this. Sorry for moaning I was just feeling a little low and frustrated from no sleep- I used to sleep all night with no problem! Yes ",

      "Content": "Hi, I had therapeutic mamoplasty and sentinal lymph node surgery on 3rd January, unfortunately lymph nodes showed cancer cells so had to have further surgery on 8th February to remove axilllary lymph nodes. I recovered exceptionally well after first operation but it took about a week to feel anywhere near normal after second operation. Although I am doing the exercises I still have limited movement and also have an ache in the shoulder blade area. Is this normal? After my first surgery my left leg was numb every morning and after being examined by Dr was told it was due to me sleeping on my back and compressing the sciatic nerve (I normally sleep on my front which I have been unable to do for 7 weeks). Although I no longer get the numbness my legs ache on a night, so between this and my armpit I am getting little sleep. Does anyone have any suggestions, I can get on my side with the help of pillows but the I end up having hot flushes!",

      "Content": "Dear Zanib , please don't let what happened stop you from going out they were school girls who had they not been together would probably not have said anything to you . I do feel that schools should educate pupils with regards to cancer . Try and be strong not everyone thinks like them be proud that you have come through what is a long and difficult journey . Are there other mums or a relative that could go with for support ? I'm quite new to this web site and have only posted a couple times but the support  here is so helpful and friendly no one judges write your fears there's always someone to give a hug . I've not been much help but I'm thinking of you sending a. Big quishy hug from Witch ",
