      "Content": "I am 14 weeks pregnant and very worried about inflammatory breast cancer which I know is aggressive and is often misdiagnosed as mastitis. I am currently on holiday and woke up earlier this week to find pink marks on both my breasts (about twice as big marks on my left breast but similar shape marks on both breasts), in a semi circular pattern around the side/lower part of each breast, around the areola. It covers about a third of my left breast. They are hot, pink and more tender than normal, I also sometimes get stabbing pains in both breasts. I have no fever or discharge and otherwise feel well. I saw the doctor here who gave me antibiotics in case of infection. I have only been taking them for 2 days but have noticed no changes. The doctor also did a blood test which showed high crp levels (which I understand indicate inflammation/infection) and slightly elevated white blood count (10.98 x10-3/ul), with high neutrophils compared to lymphocytes (81% and 12% respectively). Do you know if these blood test results indicating inflammation/infection can be an indicator of IBC too or just infection? I need to decide whether to return early from holiday to try and see a breast specialist. I am very worried both for me and my baby. Any advice would be very gratefully received Thank you",
