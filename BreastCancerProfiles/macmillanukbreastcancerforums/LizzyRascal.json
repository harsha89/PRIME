      "Content": "Hi KerriJane I have been using the cold cap, have so far had 3 x docetaxels and due to have 3 x Fec next. So far, I have kept the majority of my hair, but have lost some from the crown (which I think may have been because it wasn't fitting properly on the top the first time which is a shame, so make sure it feels like its fitting properly). I ended up having my short bob cut off into a short pixie style as it was a bit distressing having the hair come out when it started, having shorter hair meant the shedding didn't seem as noticable.  I was going to give up, but since my 2nd docetaxel dose the hair shed has slowed right down, so now going to persevere. The short cut is actually better because I can ruffle it up to cover up the bald bits and can get away with no one noticing too much as long as I haven't set foot outside (ie if the wind blows it around!)! If I go out I do put on a headscarf or I do have a wig. Whilst I have lost some hair, I have read the cold cap can help with regrowth so going to keep going if I can. I didnt feel the cap was that bad, it is like a brain freeze ice cream head for the 15 mins or so, but then it was bearable, it does make you feel a bit chilly so make sure you have some blankets to throw on. The nurse soaked my hair and sprayed in a leave in conditioner before putting the cap on. It does add time to you being there, I suppose that depends on how desperate you want to keep your hair! The advice I read about looking after your hair in between was don't wash it 48 hours before cold capping and 48 hours after, and then try and wash just twice a week with a paraben/sulphate free shampoo, comb gently with a wide tooth comb and try to keep hairdryers and straighteners etc away from it where possible. I also bought a couple of silk pillowcases as meant to help with stopping your hair from dragging on the pillow, I'm just trying it all! The reduced hairwashing sounds horrible, I use dry shampoo in between which does help to make it look more respectable, but surprisingly after a few weeks your hair does balance out a bit. I think you have to be prepared that some hair will still fall out, but don't be too disheartened, hopefully it will work well enough that you keep most of your hair, once you get past that first major shed hopefully it will slow down like it did for me, I still get a little bit come out when I wash it but not too drastic. I think you do need to keep on at the nurses about the fit initially, it can take time to get it right but they are so nice where I go and very patient!  Good luck and hope it goes OK, keep us posted on your progress. x",

      "Content": "I almost feel a bit silly posting this but it keeps playing on my mind.  I had surgery back in June (wide local excision) a small tumour was removed with clear margins and the lymph nodes removed all clear. An MRI scan before the surgery  didn't show up any other signs of cancer elsewhere, so quite positive.  I started chemo in August, and am now just over halfway.  I have been get some soreness and mild pain around the area I had the surgery, which to be honest I hadn't taken too much notice of, but recently I have noticed it more.  There isn't any redness or swelling, just the pains every now and then and it feels a little tender. I have now gone into a bit of a panic mode thinking all sorts, such as has something come back?!  I then have to breath and remind myself it surely is highly unlikely based on the results of my surgery and MRI and being in the middle of chemo.  I have got an appointment to see someone about it, but it's 2 weeks away, so in the meantime it's playing on my mind! I just wondered if anyone else has experienced this , my surgery would have been nearly 4 months ago now. I did mention it to the oncologist who said it's not uncommon as chemo can cause havoc with the nerve endings, he had a quick look and thought all looked OK but suggested I should see the consultant involved.   I think I am now a bit paranoid! ",

What oils are used on your head for the massages? I might buy some and try myself as cannot really afford to go and have many massages at a salon. I'm just so worried that I will stay bald!

      "Content": "Hi Kit-Kat I can certainly relate to your worry and feeling upset about your hair still falling out, I remember feeling the same way.  I had 3 rounds of the FEC, and my hair didn't really show any signs of stopping falling out and regrowth a good 8 weeks after.  If you have had 4 rounds, that is a lot of toxic drugs running through your body, so it might take longer to come through.  My last chemo was middle of Nov 2015, and I didn't notice any regrowth until a good week into the following January.  Have faith that your hair will come back, I don't think I have ever heard of anyone not getting it back, it might just be because you have had the extra dose of chemo.  It can take a while to get out of your system.  I expect you probably still feel shattered too, I know it took me a while.  Whilst I did lose the majority of my hair in the end, I do believe that the cold cap did help when it finally grew back, it felt quite strong, and now I have almost shoulder length thick, shiny hair.   I didn't really use anything while it was still falling out, I just used a paraben free, gentle shampoo, and was very careful with washing what I did have.  Once I had a good covering of hair, I switched to a caffeine shampoo to try and stimulate the growth, it did come back quite well, I am not sure if that helped, but you try anything to get your hair back. I hope this helps to reassure you that your hair should stop coming out and you will see it growing back.  But, if you're still worried, have a chat with your oncologist or doctor. I would really love to hear how you are doing.  Take care of yourself, x",

I had my last FEC dose just over 4 weeks ago and was expecting by now to start to see some regrowth of hair. But this is not the case, what I do have left is still falling out! I did cold cap for all 6 treatments, my hair has thinned a great deal and was going to give up but read that the cold cap can protect new hair growth, so I persevered. I'm really worried that the hair shedding isn't going to stop and my hair isn't going to grow back, I know it is quite rare for some people to not have regrowth but can't help but worry. I know it's only 4 weeks after and maybe I'm being impatient, but having read that hair starts to grow a few weeks after in just feeling anxious. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm wondering if the cold cap has just delayed the inevitable. Still treat what hair I have left very carefully, is there anything else I can do to encourage some regrowth? ",

I think it can be harder for family and friends watching a loved one go through it, because you feel like you can't do anything, I was diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer recently, I have found that being able to talk openingly with family does help, so if you are able to talk to your mum about how she is feeling and talk about the options I think it helps. This website has been brilliant for me as I can relate to others going through the same thing, I don't know if it's something your mum might consider doing as well, i think it's about empathy of others.  I was also told that chemo would be beneficial to me but didn't have to make the decision to do it, I did in the end as I thought I want to give myself the very best chance of it not coming back, and as the others have said chemo is hard going with all the side effects, but its only temporary so consider it worth it for the chance of a longer life , or reducing reoccurrence.

      "Content": "This may not be the right forum for my question, but starting here initially as this is where I found a great deal of support after a breast cancer diagnosis in May last year. I've had quite a time of it since the diagnosis, as I decided to find out if I have a defective BRCA1 gene (my mum and sister both had breast cancer too), it was confirmed I have, so I made the decision to have a bilateral mastectomy/reconstruction and have my ovaries/tubes removed.  The mastectomy/reconstruction part was done in Jan this year, and whilst still sore, had been recovering ok from that. The surgery to remove my ovaries/tubes was done on Monday (laparascopic),  during the early hours of yesterday, I had some strange things happening with my bowels!!   What I had experienced has stopped, but now I feel 'bunged up' (for want of a better word!) and it worries me a little.  I did call the doctors surgery yesterday who did explain that the bowel is moved during the procedure, and whilst he hadn't really heard of the symptoms I described to him (I didn't want to go into too much detail here!), he thought perhaps everything is just unsettled and should calm down in time, and things should be back to 'normal' soon. I just wondered if anyone else has had this type of surgery and if they may have had any similar problems afterwards?",

I ended up being given some steroids to help calm it down, but I think they try to avoid doing that if possible as your body's own natural steroids get lazy.  I took piriton regularly, which made me really drowsy but better than itching like mad.  I frequently put a cold wheaty bag on the areas affected (which I stuck in the freezer first) which seemed to help calm things down a bit, and also used aqueous cream to keep the skin hydrated as mine starting to peel and go a little leathery (like sun burn), I wouldn't use creams that are perfumed as I think it might irritate it. If it gets too bad it might be worth just getting it checked out, but I can completely sympathize with you, it's not pleasant, especially when you also have to contend with other symptoms too.

I am not sure what chemo drugs you are on (I was on 3 x Docetaxel and then 3 x FEC) it was the Docetaxel that I had the reaction to, but they said I could take Piriton or something similar to help with the itching.  Maybe it's best to check with your oncology nurse first.

      "Content": "Hi Alligog Hope you had a good Christmas, and Happy Boxing Day! I used the cold cap for 6 treatments (6 was bad enough so I take my hat off to you for enduring 12, that must be hard going), I had Docetaxel for 3 sessions and the FEC for 3, so a different chemo drug to what you are having. Unfortunately, I had the same issue, my hair kept thinning and shedding throughout treatment, but I still had enough to cover bald and thinning patches, but near the end of my last treatment more hair came out, not big handfuls, but still coming out.  I am now just over 5 weeks post chemo and in my situation the hair is still coming out, not huge amounts, but still more than the normal amount of hair that comes out naturally without chemo.   I called the Oncology nurse after 4 weeks post chemo as I was worried about hair still falling out and she didn't seem too concerned and said I should allow 6-7 weeks. At this stage, whilst the old hair is still sprinkling out every now and then, I think I can see some fluffy new hairs appearing around the sides of my head. It's a shame when you endure the cold cap throughout treatment and I do hope for you it is just a blip, but thought I would share my experience.  I assume you use a mild shampoo?  I had been using a paraben/sulphate free shampoo.   I had read that even if your hair does fall out or thin, if you can endure the cold cap it is meant to help protect new hair growth.  I also read that in most cases, people will still experience some hair loss with the cold cap, you don't say if you have had any previous hair loss, but guessing it must have been working pretty well until now.  I am not sure how true this is and my hair is certainly very slow in returning, but I think it is starting to reappear. When I put a comment on here about still losing hair after the cold cap someone suggested my iron levels might be low, so maybe it's worth checking that out, although you will have been told if this was the case with your regular blood tests. I do hope the hair stops coming out for you, would be interested to know how it all goes. Take care Liz",

      "Content": "Hi Birty I saw your post and can completely empathise with you, I had my first Docetaxel (Taxotere) on the 3rd August, and by about the 3rd/4th day I was also in so much pain in my joints, back and hips, it's horrible isn't it? It seems to sit right in your bones.  As it was my first time, I did have a bit of a panic as I wasn't sure how 'normal' it was, so I called the Helpline, the nurse was really helpful and said it will be a combination of the chemo and the Filgrastin injections I am doing at home. Said as long as my temperature is ok, I could take a combination of paracetomol and ibuprofren (but check temperature each time) which did help a little, but still quite painful.  They said that there may be an 'alternative' to the Filgrastin where they could give one dose of something rather that the 7 days of injections which might help, but meant to be pretty expensive.  It might be worth you asking as well if the pains have been bad? I am due to see the consultant this week (19th) so I am going to ask and see what he says.  Otherwise, I am going to ask if I can have a stronger painkiller.   It will improve though, I was feeling much better a few days ago, so I think I am now in the 'good week' before I go for my second dose next Tuesday. Sending big hugs, you will get through it. x",

      "Content": "Hi Freshia1 Hope you are doing ok, I noticed you mention you wasn't sure about the PICC line.  I have one in, and it's absolutely fine.  I have only had my first chemo, due for the second next Tuesday. I was unsure about the PICC line, but apart from the initial sting of the local anaesthetic I didn't feel a think when it was put in.  It seems better as they can take blood from it too, so saves your veins a bit.  It's a bit of a pain with showering, but I seemed to have got used to it, I got a waterproof tube type thing that you pull over your arm when showering which is really helpful as you can at least stand under the shower without the worry of getting the line/dressings wet.  You have to have it flushed weekly and the dressings changed, which can be a nuisance, but some local GP centres might have nurses trained to do it.  I am lucky enough to only live about 15 mins away from the MacMillan unit I attend for the chemo and the PICC line flushes, so it's not too much of a bother. Seem to be able to get on and do normal things, but I think you do have to be careful about knocking your arm, lifting things that are too heavy, and playing sports like tennis or golf as apparently this can dislodge the line.  Hope this might help you to decide. Oh, and many congrats to your son :-) x",

      "Content": "Toothbrushes - quick question I am hoping some might help with, I was advised by the chemo nurse to use a soft baby's toothbrush for teeth cleaning and mouthwash such as Corsodyl.  I am finding that the soft baby brush doesn't really feel like it's cleaning my teeth, they feel furry, and that's not very pleasant combined with the sore mouth and nasty taste!  I am not sure if I should have, but I have gone back to my electric toothbrush, but I have been running the brush under warm water to soften it up first and have been going more gently that normal, so my teeth feel much better, but I am not sure if an electric toothbrush is really a good idea? What have some of you done? Do any of you use electric toothbrushes and has it been ok? I don't want to run the risk of causing more soreness or damage etc, but I hate having furry teeth! Any advice would be greatly received. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi Birty, bless you, sounds like you have been through the mill, maybe it's the combination of the injection with the T, I am having 3 x FEC last.  I know, just when it starts to feel better it comes around again. If we can get through this though, we can do anything! ",

      "Content": "Hi , I just wanted to comment re the cold cap which some of you are trying. I'm trying it too, and like you Jooboo, have lost a fair amount of hair from the top of my head, but still have most of my hair around the front, side and back. I don't think the cap was completely touching the very top in my first session though.  I have now had my second taxotere and due for the third on the 15th (then having 3 x FEC) so I'm into about day 31. I had another major hair shed last week when I washed it, so was dreading washing it yesterday. Surprisingly, not that much came out this time around, some did, but not handfuls like before. I have no idea if this means that the major shed has now happened (or if the FEC will cause another major malt, anyone know?)  So, it might be worth persevering, I felt the same way and just thought I'm going to give in and let it go, but have changed my mind and going to continue with cold cap (if they will let me though, a bit worried as it is quite thin on top now they might say its not advisable, if anyone has experienced this would be interested to know).  I do have to wear a scarf, or my wig when i go out (a wig takes some getting used to doesn't it, it looks OK, friends and hubby say def looks good and doesn't look like a wig at all,  but you do feel like you have an illuminated sign above your head!) So, maybe give it another go? xx",

      "Content": "Hello Carol Firstly, sorry to hear you had to join this group, as you will see there are so many of us. I had a PICC line put in and was actually glad I did.  It does make the nurses job easier, but also I found better for me, as they didn't have to find a vein every time I went for my treatment, they also took blood from it too when they do the blood tests to check your blood cell count etc.  It was a bit of a nuisance having it on my arm for 3 months or so, but you do get used to it and saves you becoming a pin cushion.  You usually have to have it flushed through weekly and the dressings changed, which can be a pain, but it just becomes part of the routine.   The procedure wasn't as bad as I had thought, initially sting with the anesthetic, but after that it didn't really feel that bad and the procedure was over fairly quickly.  I had a plastic sleeve to cover the line when having a shower.  It does mean you can't go swimming or do things like racquet sports with the arm the line is in (in case it gets dislodged), but to be honest, the chemo does make you feel a bit ropey, so you probably won't feel much like doing too much anyway!   My chemo finished in November and I now have more surgery and radiotherapy to go through. I do hope it goes ok for you and wish you well for your treatment. Regards Liz",

      "Content": "Hi, so sorry to hear your feeling poorly, it really does knock you for six doesnt it? I experienced much the same,  not as bad as you describe but stomach did feel iffy. Also had the really bad joint pains but they did subside. I found I was pretty much out of action for a couple of weeks, and then the third week before my next dose I felt better, still a bit washed out, but at least not feeling so ill, so I tried to make up for not eating each much in that week! Have you tried drinking a little bit of milk, might help with the acidy feeling. Not sure what drugs you have to take at home,, but if you have Ciprofloxacin to take,it says do not take milk, if yours is the same, the Ciprofloxacin starts on the 8th day of chemo, so you might be ok to have some milk now. I've only just had 2nd dose of docetaxel (yesterday) so also a bit new to this! How many doses are you having? Have you got to have the FEC or something else after the Docetaxel? Hope you feel better soon, this isn't much help I  know, but do understand completely what it feels like, stay strong, take care x",

      "Content": "Hi Gaynor,  I am sorry you have lost so much hair even with the cold cap, but hope you might be able to keep what's left, its a job to know whether to just bite the bullet and cut off what's left or persevere isn't it? I am also trying cold cap,  I am only in day 13, having had first chemo Monday last week. I have also been getting the sensation you describe on my scalp. A bit of hair came out yesterday but I am also trying to prepare myself for the hair loss, as much as you know its going to happen , its still distressing which I'm yet to endure. I'm not sure what advice you were given or had read about the cold cap, but I have found out that you should only wash your hair in a mild sulphate/pararben free shampoo (I've got the baby shampoo from Asda called Halos and Horns, or Boots sell a range called Naked which is paraben free, don't buy Johnson's as I think that has as much of the parabens as other shampoos), be gentle and restrict to washing every few days or about twice a week. My hair looked hideous but the greasiness seems to have balanced out a bit. Also, try not to wash within a couple of days before your cold cap and 2-3 days after. Use a wide tooth comb and try not to use heat like dryers, straighteners etc, save that for special ocasions. I also bought silk pillowcases. This is stuff I've read, so it might be worth a try to hang on to what's left of your hair if you haven't tried some of these,  I had also read that a lot of ladies still persevered with the cold cap even though they did lose a fair amount of hair as it seemed to helped with regrowth as well. I am yet to find out if doing these things will help, but I think it seems even with the cold cap you will shed some hair, and I suppose it does differ. Did you get your hair cut a bit shorter as well? Mine was shoulder length but I had it cut into a shorter bob as I was told it works better on shorter hair. Hope some of this might help and fingers crossed for you, I will keep posted on what happens to mine. Be strong, and sending hugs.      ",
