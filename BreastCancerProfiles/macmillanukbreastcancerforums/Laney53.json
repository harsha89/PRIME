      "Content": "Hello there. I am two years in remission but saw your post and can offer my own experience although we are all individuals so you may have a different outcome. I had lumpectomy followed by chemo and Radiotherapy. I did ballroom dance and gym and swim so reazonbaly okay in Upper body strength but I already had arthritis in neck and shoulders. I made sure to keep active after surgery to avoid any seizing up. Its tempting to favour your surgery side but I was very strict about doing my exercises as instructed although walking my arms up the wall was so very difficult. The worst part for me was radiation therapy as I had to lie still with arms above head while being zapped. I lost sensation in my arms but saw humour in it. When they said\"you can bring your arms down now\" I wanted to say \"What arms\". You just have to grit your teeth and get it done. Dont worry about this right now. The point I want to make is that it will be beneficial to keep those muscles active no matter what. Good luck. Keep your sense of humour and do as you are told and look ahead to the day you climb off the rollercoaster and join those of us who already bought the teeshirt.  Elaine ",

      "Content": "Unfortunately mouth problems are common with Fec regime. I had severe issues but Difflam, Gelclair, and salt gargles helped, you have to persevere. Putting up with mouth pain and ulcers is a small thing if you just hold on to the fact that these drugs are seeing off the cancer. Its worth the pain although this was the worst part of the whole treatment for me.   Remember when you gave cough mixture to your kids and told them it would make them better? Well now its your turn for the medicine. I had blisters under my tongue and ulcers and oral thrush and Cold sores. Doctor prescribed Acyclovir tablets and zovirax cream. Tastebuds will be crap too and your appetite will change on a daily basis. One day I liked fish, the second day I hated it. Porridge is good and use straws to drink to avoid the pain. Keep some in your handbag.  Just remember that this pain will pass but I do find I still get ulcers and coldsores much more frequentiy and my tongue remains coated most days.....and I am two years on. Sorry to tell you that and it might not be the same for you. Once I had come thru chemo I took Biotin,and turmeric and these helped me and my healing. Its a long hard journey but you can find the strength if you dig down deep. Good luck guys, just hang in there.  Elaine",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy 2 weeks ago with Axillary Clearance. I dont know if they have got all the lymph nodes or just some. I have my follow up next week.   I have Jackson Pratt drain and the area is all between breast and underarm so the bandaging is under my armpit. My armpit is clear and no scarring. I have had a chafing (not really a burning sensation) in the area between my armpit and elbow on the underside of my arm. At first I thought it was because my arm was scraping the drain and bandages but I have wrapped the arm in gauze, worn soft sleeves and done everything I can to avoid contact with the 2 areas. I dont have any visible signs of chafing.   I tried to see if anyone had a sinilar query but no one has mentioned this.  The area stings and makes it difficult to function and is the only thing bringing me down.  My thoughts are that this could be nerve sensation (Intercostal Brachial neuropathy).., Has anyone got simialar symptoms- and does it go away of its own accord. I am actaully quite relieved to have had the surgery although I expect to have chemo and not looking forward to that, but I take it as one day at a time. I dont look beyond tomoorw as no one can predict what will happen next.. I have a good gropu of friends and family and found it easier to be open with people about what is happening so they feel they can ask me questions. I told everyone at work via an email so I dont get awkward questions when I return. I know that doesnt work for everyone but I found that it helped me come to terms with it.  I alsoo have a couisn who has the mantra \"Suck it up buttercup\" for anything that can drag you down in life generally and when I am feeling down I Just say that to myself and it makes me feel better.  she also made me a snuggle quilt woth the phrase embroidered on it which is priceless. I wasnt going to join any forums but reading other experiences certainly makes me feel less alone. and no my friends I am going to go for a short walk while the sun is shining.  Each day I try to do one nice thing just for me.   Laney      ",

      "Content": "I ordered \"the chemo cookery club\" by penny ericson from the library. Dont buy them, use your library services.   It is full of good ideas. I feel nauseous for the first few days anyway so just have what you fancy when you fancy it, but drink plenty. Ribena is good if you cant face water. I go off milk and tea so I use herbal teas, rosehip, jasmine and choco chai are all good, or just hot water. Also I googled smoothies and found some good ones for days when I have ulcers. Flaxseed sprinkled on bran cereal for the constipation. It protects against blood clots if you have a picc line and is full of gooness, lots of types available in holland and Barrett, you only need a spoonful each day. Good luck everyone",

      "Content": "I had my pre-chemo check last Tuesday. Basically they go thru all side effects and ask you to fil in a questionnaire to assess how weell you are cooing and will cope. For example, do you have support of family and friends, do you talk to people at work, do you have dark thoughts, do you feel isolated, do you need a counsellor, who will do your shopping, who do you have to help you get to and from hospital. It us really niothing to worry about. They have noted that I need a PICC line due to invisible veins and have referred me to hairdresser fir wig and advice. We are all going to be in this together, 6 cycles and then radiotheray planned for me. I just want it to start so I can put it behind me and start to make plans.  None of us knows how we will deal with this but we have to get on with it and acceot the bad days and the good. I start chemo next Tuesday 10th so off to Windsor for the weekend to gird my loins.  Good luck to us all./ Ps my bad moment was cutting my hair really short last weekend. I have discovered a pair of ears under all the hair so I am showing off my earring collection.",
