      "Content": "Hello - I have not posted for a while as I felt things were on the up. I was dx last July and had an mx with expander then reconstruction in December. I found out last week that he has been unfaithful to me and has had a mistress in another country who he saw whilst on business. It started in October and then restarted in February. I am 42 with 2 young children and we have been together for about 12 years. One of the reasons he gave was that he found being a ʻbreast cancer husbandʻ so stressful and that it was an escape. On the one hand I do love him but how can I trust someone again who has let me down at my darkest hour ? I am in deep shock with it all and cannot believe the year I have had. It terrifies me that the stress will bring the cancer back. Has anyones husband had a bad reaction too ? Been weak like him ? Any any advice would be appreciated",

      "Content": "Hi Karen I have not tried Nioxin but know it as my husband Has used it for hair loss - he used it for a few years and used to get it from a website hairhq.com i think it was called. To be honest not too sure that it works ? I guess it depends on the person. I saw a new product from Aveda recently I think it was called Invati - again one to promote hair growth. I havent experienced hair loss through treatment but after having my first child I lost lots and lots of hair - I had quitea few bald patches. I took sea kelp tablets and they really helped me so when I had my second child I was aleady taking them and that time my hair was fine - they might be worth giving a go ? Hope that helps Cazza x",

I had private healthcare through work so the insurer picked up the bill - it cost £2600 or so. I am in the UK nd my biopsy slides were sent to California for testing so yes it can be arranged from the UK. The US does seem to be further ahead than us in the UK re testing etc. I will pssibly be having hormone therapy but not keen to take Tamoxifen Any other questions then please ask Love Cazza",

After the nipple sparing MX some of my nipple died so it does look a little squashed - I doubt if much could be done with it for a while if it all. Has anyone else experienced this ? Is it possible surgically to create a nipple that sticks out - my other one does and it would be good if they matched ! Love Cazza x",
