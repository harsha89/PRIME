      "Content": "Hi Fiona Apologies for jumping on the thread but I read it and it supplies so much encouragement to us all and is very well written and thought out - its fantastic. Although I have a Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (or should I said had) I read this post and thought how good it was - like I say fantastic and my wife read and thought the same - it just inspires people.  I looked at the points and came up with the following:  On No.1: The fact that you went for the treatment and have gone through it shows without doubt that there is plenty of courage and strength within you as without that you would never have got this far and you have so that is bravery and courage in abundance. On No.2: The gratitude - well the fact you have three children makes you very lucky as they can supply you with the inspiration when your down. A friend of mine is a multi-millionaire who has everything him and his wife could want except the one thing they really wanted - children (despite all the IVF and such treatments they went for - they didn't want to adopt they always wanted their own) and he still calls me lucky as I have four kids - that's being really lucky. The bit about going toilet I can feel for you as in the R-chop I was having the Vincristine part of it causes mayhem like that but we all get through it. I have also been lucky that I have walked with my sons everyday and am now back at work (Feb 1st 16) as I was only diagnosed in November 16 - I was lucky that I had a mindset to achieve the goals I wanted and the ones I still want and by the looks of it you have set yourself goals to achieve what you want  On No.3: On the compassion it is great to see that people on this site are so helpful and extremely encouraging - it is very easy for all of us to \"Google\" an answer and come up with thousands of different scenarios none of which are true - most are just to designed to attract your attention  or frighten people and they don't see the emotions of people or care - a sad but true reflection of the world we live in . The reality of the situation suddenly hits you then you come on to this site and ask a question about cancer and people are there and helping you through it so you are never alone people here will always understand where you are. On No.4: The knowledge - essentially the \"give back\" part of this. We have all been on a journey of sorts - not one we wanted to go on it but the one we were given. We are extremely lucky on this site, everyone that either joins it or contributes to it, that we can try to help others on the same road and hopefully make things easier for them to understand and realize they are not alone as we know where they are and it can be a very lonely road so if we can help after the experience we've had then it may make it easier for them to deal with knowing there are people who will help them. On No.5: The acceptance - you are right no of us ever have any control over what has happened to us or what will but life is like that in general - the way I looked at this illness when first diagnosed was that I could either lay down and let it win or stand up and fight it so I have chosen the fight which I believe is a fight I will win with my family,s help and a bit of help from the man upstairs. I have, as we all have had, had bad days and good days but going on holiday in May with my wife inspires me to get on with things and your'e right its our lives this illness has attacked but you can still enjoy it and eventually get back to it. Thanks for reading this and apologies for jumping on the thread. Regards Mike B ",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona Firstly apologies as I said you had three children and you have two - unfortunately \"Chemo-Brain\" and age kicked in there. We are all very lucky to have each other to lean on on this site and your post earlier will inspire people I am sure. Good luck with your last chemo session next week. Regards Mike B  ",
