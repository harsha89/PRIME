      "Content": "I must apologise - on 11 January I wrote to say I'd be starting a Macmillan blog called 'compassion in healthcare' - it's actually 'compassionate care'. It's for people who want to know more about breast screening - the real facts, the up to date science and debate in medical journals - not tailored truth. This may be uncomfortable. Some people would rather not know, so to respect them I won't be posting information in this group - only on my blogs, Facebook, Twitter, Linked In etc. For those who do like to be informed, I've just posted another link to an editorial in the bmj written by the Director of NHS Screening Programmes, with a second  link to online responses. Not everyone writing in this group may want to know the truth about screening, but for those who do I will post information as it reaches me. (Sorry for the recent delay - been ill...). You may also want to take a look at evenstarsexplode.wordpress.com which has information on screening accumulated over the past few years, including links to the Danish Cochrane Centre, who published their own breast screening information leaflet so that women could be properly informed. They have also posted their response to the Independent Review (Marmot Report) online.",

      "Content": "I have the benefit of contact with leading experts in this field - not boasting - just appreciate how lucky I am - so have been abreast of the research and opinions for some time. ground - you are right - this is not happening at the moment - that's why, after much campaigning and research, the breast screening information leaflet was re-written, but still fell far short of the truth; that's why an independent review was set up. It was also admitted to me personally, when I was invited to join the public screening information panel, that the NHS BSP leaflet had not been honest, and I agreed to join only if what it produced would, this time, be really honest. But to be honest, it needs to be based on robust evidence, to show the benefits, harms and uncertainties and do it in an understandable way. We have yet to see if this will be achieved. In the meantime, it is understandable that information which seems to turn everything we know about screening and breast cancer on its head should stir up strong feelings. And when people come up against something which seems counter-intuitive it is natural that they can't see beyond and accept more. Mammography is a useful tool for symptomatic cancer, but it does find false negatives (as it did for me) and false positives - but these are different from the 4000 'overdiagnoses'  that have been shown to occur. I've had 2 different cancers, have several co-morbidities and much treatment related fatigue, so I'm going to leave this discussion and let everyone simmer down. I'm currently trying to raise awareness that women invited as part of the age extension to breast cancer are not explicitly told they are being invited to participate in a randomised controlled trial...but that's another ethical issue. I've offered my blog address where more research can be found and now I'll offer perhaps the best person to listen to - Professor Michael Baum, who helped set up the breast screening programme, but later had doubts about it's effectiveness and the harms. It has taken many years for his voice (along with others') to be heard. And yes, his family too has been affected greatly by breast cancer. His UCL lunchtime lecture from October or November 2010 can be found at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxDnRMU-l7w&list=PL02FB95682C65FD62&index=6&feature=plpp_video",

      "Content": "Thanks Clare. But I don't want people to read into messages about screening that gruelling treatments are a waste of time. In fact the opposite - there is still the good news that women are living longer with breast cancer, but research shows it's due to improved treatments, not to screening. So we can take a positive slant on the research. Things are getting better thanks to improved treatments. And if the screening programme is ever modified to target only those most at risk, others will not be adversely affected - nor will they be harmed by overdiagnosis and treatment - and on top of that, resources could be used for the benefit of women with symptomatic breast cancer and to improve breast cancer services. As Prof Baum says - most women are more at risk of heart disease or stroke than breast cancer. over and out",

      "Content": "The screening debate has been about inviting targeted women in the general population, women who have no symptoms of cancer ie healthy women - to participate in regular screening by mammography - when it has found to be mostly ineffective but to cause major harms. Mammography for women with symptoms is a whole different ball game, as it is a useful tool for diagnosing cancers in symptomatic women. And, as you say, your chances of developing cancer in your other breast are higher than the general population. The problem with a diagnosis of DCIS is no-one can tell which are the cancers likely to progress and be a problem and which will never cause symptoms - but women are mostly treated (and with more mastectomy than with invasive cancer) - because they have not been told there is a choice - and it has become routine. Yes - you are right - patients should be given the information and allowed the choice. Some are, but it seems most are not - and I have yet to hear of someone being told about overdiagnosis, let alone overtreatment... Yet research shows that women whose cancers are found by screening are merely cancer patients for longer. So when they are described as 'doing better, living longer' it just means death occurs at the same period of time as without screening - but they have experienced trauma etc over a longer period of time because they were diagnosed when changes were very small. It is all explained in the NY Times link I gave earlier which explains research findings. But it's difficult to accept something that goes against all we have been told - like finding out there is no Father Christmas! So the NHS Breast Screening Programme is called into question. But it's now an industry and not something to be stopped overnight.  When it was started it seemed a good idea and probably was, but mammography is able to detect smaller and smaller changes (many of which are simply natural changes to be found in anyone at any time) and over the years treatments have improved hugely and are shown by research to be the real cause of breast cancer patients now living longer/having lives saved. Someone asked me 'what will we do without breast screening?' I answered, 'Be healthy!' Researchers have shown the best way (for healthy women) to avoid breast cancer is not to go to screening. Women with a high risk of breast cancer will have different needs to the general population. Please note I am not medically qualified but serve only as a conduit, collating research evidence for others and providing useful links. I was asked to sit on a panel looking at writing new information for all screening programmes, but we were not allowed to decide on content. http://www.cochrane.dk/screening/index-en.htm takes you to the nordic cochrane centre - gold standard research centre, who wrote their own breast screening leaflet because the NHS leaflet did not tell women the truth. On this website you can also find their comments on the finding of the Marmot Report on the breast screening independent review.

      "Content": "And I'm disappointed but not surprised at this reception - it is usually a case of shoot the messenger of uncomfortable news. The devil is in the detail. To understand fully one needs to follow the research. But the article by Welch in the NY Times is one the best explained and most easily understood for those with receptive ears/eyes that I've come across, though I have others. If an article, though from impeccable source, is seen as just political so to be disregarded, (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/opinion/cancer-survivor-or-victim-of-overdiagnosis.html) perhaps more may be gained from this bmj article and even more from accessing the original Welch research:   bmj 2012;345:e7910 doi: 10.1136/bmj.e7910 (published 21 November 2012)   Mammography results in substantial overdiagnosis of breast cancer, concludes study Jacqui Wise London Screening mammography has resulted in the overdiagnosis of breast cancer in 1.3 million women in the United States in the past 30 years, concludes a new study. Overdiagnosis means that tumors are detected on screening that would never lead to clinical symptoms, so women undergo unnecessary surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The study, in the New England Journal of Medicine,1 estimated that more than 70 000 women in the US were overdiagnosed in 2008, representing almost a third of all cases of breast cancer diagnosed in women aged 40 or over. This latest research adds to the growing debate about the merits of screening mammography. Only a few weeks ago an expert panel concluded that every year 4000 women in the United Kingdom underwent treatment for breast cancer that would not have harmed them.2",

      "Content": "Over the past 3 years I've been campaigning for breast screening information to be honest. Some of us lobbied for an independent review of breast screening because the harms have been known but not communicated to women. Now the review has finished and reported 4000 women a year are harmed because of 'overdiagnosis' - finding and treating 'pseudo-cancers' or cancers that would never progress to be a problem in a lifetime. Official advice is that acceptance of screening should be a woman's choice - yet is recommended (!) But women have come to rely on screening mammography as a life-saver because of the biased and inadequate level of information they have received . Even now, the truth is not officially out: 1300 lives saved per year figure is highly controversial because the Marmot report did not include all-cause-mortality (deaths from treatments and other causes) as it needed to, in order to be valid. It is difficult for ordinary mortals to understand complicated research, but the latest findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine (H Gilbert Welch) are explained in the New York Times by a highly reputable source in an easily readable and understandable way: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/opinion/cancer-survivor-or-victim-of-overdiagnosis.html",
