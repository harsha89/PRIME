I had my 6 months after treatment checkup and was NOT told it was lymphodema of the breast, although its got all the hallmarks of it, Chrystaljuju. I was given a leaflet with an 8 step lymphmassage 'self help'. I also went to my 7th appointment for the study with he lymphodema clinic and was told all was well but they never even looked at my breast just measured arm, although I said how much it hurt. I can't  really do much more, I had twice advice from experts.  Hope you can get yours sorted out. I would be interested what advice you get.",

Mine shrunk from 2 cm to 13 cm, also well done to complete your chemo, I could not do the last two Ts. I found the lumpectomy and radiotherapy easy compared to the chemo. I finished with all my treatment on 31st December and my first mamography showed 'no worrying features' I belong to a facebook site called: Trippe Negative Cancer Survivors. It's an american site, but really friendly and people from all over the world belong to it. There are many long term survivors on it.  I wish all the best with your upcoming operation. ",

I asked about a CT scan, but they don't do it, I am not sure if it is expense or the radiation?  I went to four 'Moving On Sessions' and we were told if we have a pain, cough etc. longer than 2 weeks (I was told initially 4 weeks) we have to contact the breast care nurse (we can by pass the GP for 5 years).  You are on Tamoxifen, which is good. For quite a few of us with Triple Negative, there is no further treatment. It sounds like your cancer was caught early, so don't worry, learn to trust your body again which has its own healing mechanism.  I send you lots of good wishes also for you caring for your husband. ",

Have they mentioned radiotherapy? I found Chemo hard but Radiotherapy quite easy. Perhaps she could just have RT.  As you and Mistymoley say, she has to make the decision. If I could go back and make the decision myself I would go for it, especially if she hasn't many health issues. The team will keep an eye on her and if she suffers too much they will reduce the dose or omit the last session or two. In the great scheme of things 18 weeks are not that long. She then does not have to tell herself: if I only had.....! But take this advice with a pinch of salt, I am only a lay person.  I wish you a good decision which is right for Your Mum in law. ",

Ok, for lots of us it was/is tough but for me the fear of the unknown was worst (i could take the nausea, which wasn't worse than sailing in a Force 4 ). With hindsight I was far too worried about every little ache and pain. I know you have to ring the treaded number if your temperature goes up, but I was taking my temperature at least 10 times a day and sometimes wonder if I really needed to be admitted to hospital 3 times for antibiotic infusions. There is so much good advice on here to prevent mouth sores ( i suffered with these a lot, they usually appeared 8 days after Chemo). I always felt really well again two weeks after Chemo, more or less normal!  I wish you all the best, listen to your body but don't get paranoid, like me! ",

I am 67 years old and found Chemo really hard, every time I had to be admitted to 4/5 days of hospital for antibiotic infusions.  In the end: after 3 Fec and one Taxol my oncologist called a halt. It's true your mum is doing so well, just staying out of hospital. Of course I would never encourage anybody to finish with Chemo early, but if it becomes intolerable it might be the best thing. If she can continue, with your help, the better. My oncologist said that there is a new school of thought that four cycles can be enough. I had chemo before Op and my tumour shrunk considerably. So that might have influenced the decision which was made by the whole team, oncologist, consultant and surgeon.  I wish your mum and you all the best and lots of strength.       ",

If I just would have known that at the time. Perhaps you should talk to your GP and he could give you something to get you over this difficult time. I send you my best wishes.

I only eat dark chocolate and  make puddings with sugar substitute or agave syrup or manuka honey. I did join a group on facebook who fight their cancer with a carbofree diet, similar to an Atkins diet, but tha's near impossible and I lost too much weight. ",

I am sure you are right, us older ladies do perhaps not get as much help as the younger ones, but I think perhaps we are of a generation, we don't like asking for help. I still regret not having asked for counselling. In our follow on course we were told that this is ready available. If I just would have asked, this would have helped.  You sound though very upbeat and brave, you managed all this on your own. ( I have got a husband I can moan to). I think it's important that we keep our friendships up, meet up, invite people round for tea, lunches, or you might be able to put you being an artist to good use and do sessions for interested people in homes?  I am sure you will get lots more answers. I send you lot of good wishes.   ",

That's very much what I wanted to do, but was persuaded by family and friends to 'chuck' everything at it which the medical world offers. I also belong to  a ketogenic facebook group (they advocate a diet of meat, high fat cheese, cream etc. and many vegetables and fruit are banned and no carbs). I tried this for a while but lost so much weight. I now just stay off high sugar snacks and drinks. I I went through chemo and surgery and start radiotheraphy soon. I think if the cancer comes back in the future I will not tell anyone and go down the alternative route. Perhaps Mistletoe injections and go back to the ketogenic diet. For the time being I am glad I did try the 'medical' route, because I would have always questioned myself, what if?  I wish you lots of success, it sounds as if you are doing well. Keep in contact. I will follow this thread.  Monika",

It's an American site but international. It's more instant than a forum, you get an answer very quickly. If you have any trouble to join, let me know.  If I would have to go through Chemo again, I would buy a wig (you could probably have one made out of your lovely long hair). I would go for a hairstyle I always dreamed about. Scarves and hats get so boring. And on Strictly come Dancing I always admire the ladies when they wear wigs, they look better somehow!  I wish you all the best. You sound very positive. ",

If your arm, wrist and hand are swollen I would start worrying about lymphodema, thst's what Oncologist said. I am taking part in a study for lymphodema and was told on Friday that all was well.

I was warned that a second Op might be needed, but was relieved that all was removed. At the moment I do ask myself if I can ever play tennis again. I am still numb and my movements are still impaired. I am taking part in a study for lymphodema and I was told that all was well. Like Sally, I wear gloves for household chores and I am careful not to injure this arm. Put lots of E 45 on as well. I wasn't very good with excercing, it just hurt too much, but now I am doing weight excersises with a bag of sugar. This has really helped, I think my mobility is coming back.  I wish you all the best with your Op. That bit I quite enjoyed, especially waking up from anasthetic and having a cup of tea and toast. ",

After my first chemo (before op) and landing in hospital neutropenic, I wrote a long letter to my consultant saying that I did not want to continue with Chemo but would much rather have a complete masectomy.  I have a theory, that nowadays it's the 'belt and braces' approach to make absolutely sure. I have two friends who had masectomies twenty years ago and they never had chemo nor were they on hormone inhibitors.  In the end I had three FEC and one T because my family persuaded me. My treatment summary says that the tumour shrunk from 20mm to 13mm Grade 1 and node positive 1 out of 17. So I guess it did some good! My mammogram which I had a week ago will show!!       ",

Ask to be transferred to the lymphodema clinic, there you will have a long appointment with the lymphodema nurse. I was adviced to do massages and got a DVD to learn, I got little cushions with beads to put in vest to massage my breast.  The next step, if it doesn't get better is taping it with plasters, I think it's called kynetic? One lady I met on 'Moving forward' was very enthusiastic about this. Have you got a compression sleeve? Wear this for all excersise, don't do work over your head, paint ceilings, hang curtains, prune trees etc. you could also be described a compression vest. (I am better without bra and wear a support vest, but I have Kira Kneitley size boobs).  I hope this helps, Puzzle. ",

I slept very well after Chemo and after Op, but now on radiotherapy I have sleepless nights again without the nightmares (are you at the radiotherapy stage Liddyloo? Do you think it gives you insomnia?) I wish you all the best, the good thing is, that it will pass and the human mind is wonderful in forgetting. I think when I finish radiotheraphy on Wednesday I will be quite at a loss, I will be out there on my own, without any hospital appointments for 6 weeks. ",

I say 'recovery' because statistics shows that most women nowadays recover, it's treatable. This is my most important advice, keep focused, I had terrible thoughts, especially at night, but After Chemo, OP and radiotheraphy I am NED, no evidence of disease. You will be there in a few months time and your partner and you will come out if it better and stronger. ",

When I was diagnosed I odered a book from Amazon about an actress, I think it  was Vanessa Redgrave's sister, who was photographed by her daughter over several month going through masectomy. I never even unpacked it. I just couldn't. (If anybody wants it you could send me your address, but I don't know if there is a Personal message board?).  I feel that the cause - breastcancer research/awareness- must not alienate people by too agressive canvassing. That would be a shame. ",

It's interesting how you get treated in other countries, that's why i joined a forum in Germany. Up to now I have found that the health care staff  are really friendly (although in a rush in the rad dep and not communicative). and also they never lecture you, while in Germany patients do get told exactly what to do, which annoys some. ",

      "Content": "Dear Lou, I feel so much with you, but Javron has explained it really well. I was admitted three times during my Chemo in the summer (yours is even worse because it was Christmas). I was always devastated, when my temperature shot up because I knew I would end up in hospital yet again. The nurses used to say: not you again!!! Just like you, I was petrified, especially at night. I thought I would have long term effects from all the chemo and the antibiotics. But I can reassure you, I am really well again now. No long term effects at all and we are even making jokes about it now!! The postponement of the Chemo is annoying, but it's better that your immune system is in top form again, a week here or there doesn't matter in the great scheme of things.  I wish you, dear Lou, all the best. I send you many good vibes. You will soon have it all behind you.     Monika     ",
