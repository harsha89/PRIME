      "Content": "I don't know really where to begin.  I had my first over 50 mammogram last week and have been called back for a secondary screening.  I have spoken to the nurse at Luton and she explained it really well, to see if it's a normal part of me.  She has explained what they are looking at is really small and that it could be nothing.  I go on Friday to have  the second procedures (hopefully snow permitting).  I could be working myself into worrying over nothing but st the same time none of us know.  They are comparing a scan from 2012 as well.  My poor mum died of breast cancer in 1987 so this has always been very raw for me.  I understand that all of you lovely ladies living through this are doing a fantastic and coping well.  I really just don't know how I would feel, i am welling up as I write this and it could all be ok.  Sorry if it sounds negative to all of you that are positive but I hope some of you can send me some positive vibes. Ann Thank you",
