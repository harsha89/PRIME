    "Content": "My tattoo is 11 years old and has faded. A quote to have it redone is £750 which I simply can't afford. Does anyone know if I can still have this done on the NHS even though I have now been discharged, or if any charities can help? I was 39 when diagnosed with breast cancer and had DIEP reconstruction. I'm I 51 now and taking care of my appearance generally and want to maintain this if I can. Any advice warmly welcomed.  Xx",
