    "Content": "This is my first blog, so forgive me! I am scheduled to have a double masectomy on Oct. 1. A little history - my mother died at the age of 38 (I'm 31) after a 5 or 6 year battle with BC. They have found a mass under my left arm and wanted to biopsy it and I've chosen to have a full masectomy instead. I'm tired of holding my breath every six months to find out if they are going to find something again and if it is or is not cancer. So I will know the day of my surg. I guess what I'm saying is I know how scared you are - I'm terrified. I have a 2 year old and 5 year old little girls. I'm very active and love to be outside running, riding, whatever the case may be. I'm so scared about how I'm going to look, what my husband is going to think/react, what my girls are going to see me go through. The last one bothers me the most. I watched my mom go through hell, and I'm so scared of what they will see. My job has been great - I'm an engineer for heavey equipment. My surgeon thinks I'll be back at work in about 2-3 months. My dad is taking it the hardest - I think it has brought back a lot of bad memories for him. BUT, he is there for me anytime I need him. I just want you to know you're not alone and I fully understand what you are feeling. This seems like a great site and I'm glad I have found it. Mel",
