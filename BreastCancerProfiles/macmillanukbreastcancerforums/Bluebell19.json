    "Content": "Yes, I have just finished radio a few weeks ago and wore nail polish and full makeup even though it was my head being treated and I had to wear a mask! My make up stayed intact! I believe in look good feel good so dress up and just be careful not to have any creams perfumes lotions or the like near the area being treated and go easy on the scent as some patients become very sensitive to strong scents during treatments or maybe feeling a bit queasy, give yourself a spray on the way out! Good Luck with the Radio! It really worked for me!  Best Wishes ",
