    "Content": "I am pretty sure this is the painkiller Peter was given yesterday before they took his drain out. He has been violently sick since and they even took him down for an xray during the night, he is nil by mouth today but hasn't eaten anything since the op anyway. Have put him back onto a drip of paracetamol. The pain has been unbearable since his op on Wednesday........I thought it was a bit of 'man pain' at first but now you have made me feel awful!! They have now said that his stoma is blocked so this could be another reason for the sickness. Hope they can start to manage your discomfort ASAP. Nobody can start to recover while they are feeling so out of control. Cherryl",
