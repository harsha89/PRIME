      "Content": "Hi all, I had a mastectomy on 25/7/18 and since then everything has gone wrong. I developed seroma which I kept having drained, then I developed a severe infection and flap necrosis which I had debrided  in clinic but was too severe so went back to Theatre. When I came round I was told they had to open the wound as the necrosis was widespread and I had a large haematoma and pockets of seroma. Since then I have been back in with sepsis and am now on VAC therapy to close the wound, I understand this will take around 8 weeks. I am at the end of my tether and not coping at all. Has anyone else had similar problems ",
