    "Content": "Hi, I have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.  It is grade 3 NST, I\u2019m off to hospital tomorrow for an echo and then back Thursday for 3 appointments1 is an mri and 2 are in oncology.  I\u2019m hoping that when I sign the paperwork Thursday that I will then know rough dates for my chemo.  I haven\u2019t really cried since they told me they suspected it was cancer, which was over 2 weeks ago. I didn\u2019t cry when they told me for certain it was cancer.  I am unsure how I feel in all honesty.  I am a happy bubbly person who is always smiling. I know I am not alone, I have friends and family but sometimes you need someone from the outside to talk to  ",
