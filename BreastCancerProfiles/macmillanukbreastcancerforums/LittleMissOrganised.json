      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I'm brand new to the site too. Hope I'm doing this right! Sorry to jump on the band-wagon! I was diagnosed in August with Bilateral Breast Cancer (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma- I think that's right! It was so long ago!). I have two lumps in one and one lump in the other- my body decided to be greedy! The term 'Stage One' was bandied around as they were all below 2cm in size but I've been told they were Grade Three. My lymph nodes were also tested and came back as negative. I've only just worked up the courage to come on here. I think I've been in denial. It's like this is all happening to someone else half the time! I've just finished my fourth cycle of chemo. I'm on FEC. Two more rounds to go! Then I'm due to have a double mastectomy after that. They have said they are going to wait and see in regards to radio therapy afterwards- they're not sure on that front yet. I've stayed positive so far but I've had a bit of a 'wobbly' week and I've felt a bit emotional. I'm extremely nervous about the operation. I'm scared of so many things! Anyway, just wanted to say Hi! x",

      "Content": "Hi Blue, Thank you so much for your reply! I'm needle phobic too so chemo and all the fertility treatment before hand has been a real rollercoaster for me. My fiancé has ended up doing all my injections as I'm too frightened to do my own. I've had so many injections now though I'm beginning to become a bit numb to all it now. Well, apart from the nasty zoladex injections (I've been put on those to put me into a chemically induced menopause to try and protect my ovaries from chemo). They hurt! It's so reassuring to hear that I'm not the only one having tough days. I thought I was doing so well and I was positive for so long. I've been brutally honest with my friends and family most of the time and let them know how I'm feeling and what I'm going through. I just felt it was easier for me to deal with if they knew as much as possible. But this week I've had some dark and twisty thoughts that are too dark to even share with them! My fiancé has been amazingly supportive thankfully but I don't want to scare him sometimes with the thoughts going on in my head! I don't know why I've suddenly gone a bit mental. I've been going through this for months now! But I think a part of me was just going through the motions and it's only really now that I'm coming out of denial. I'm almost glad in a way you say that the emotional side is more difficult than the physical side of the op. The physical part scares me a lot. I'd like to think I can cope with my head if I can cope with the pain. Well, saying that, I am scared about how my body will look after the double mastectomy. So, that's probably bit of a silly statement to make! I've started to make a mental note of questions for the surgeon. I'm seeing them mid-December to schedule the op once I've nearly finished chemo. I think I may have so many questions I'll scare them! I'm usually very good at doing that! I'm going to be on tamoxifen too, how are you finding that? Although mine is being prescribed just as a precaution. I'm unclassifiable apparently! Two of my lumps were behaving like triple negative lumps and one lump was mildly oestrogen positive and due to that, they are going to treat the whole cancer like it's oestrogen positive even though only one of them was, if that makes sense! Pumping my body full of more drugs for years to come also scares me. I just want my life back! But, I do appreciate that it could help the cancer not to come back and obviously I want that more than anything. Good news though- the chemo is appearing successful so far! No scans as yet, only examinations, but my oncologist thinks two lumps have already gone and one is now so small it is too small to measure! Here's hoping... Good luck with the radio Blue! When do you start? x",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for your advice. You've all been so helpful and reassuring. I had a SLNB beforehand so I've had a few nodes removed but not a full clearance or anything like that. I'm quite fortunate perhaps as I still have full sensation in my arms and armpits, just not the breasts themselves. Surprisingly and quite worryingly, I've apparently had no saline put in during the initial op. I am quite petite and even with nothing in the expanders at the moment and due to a little swelling, I already look like I have little boobs- perhaps AA cup (I was a B before). I'm worried that if I'm finding it painful with nothing in, how on earth will I manage when they do actually start to add saline?! Is the expansion process itself painful and how long does it take roughly? I know it's early days, but I can't even bring myself to touch them or look at them. I was doing so well prior to the op (I've already had chemo) but now I think I've been completely in denial. I'm glad to hear it does get better because at the moment it feels like it never will. ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I had my double mastectomy a week ago. At the same time, they fitted tissue expanders. They are not yet expanded but will start to be in a couple of weeks. I've had quite a difficult time and was in hospital for 5 days suffering from quite severe pain and sickness (although the surgery itself went well). At the moment, I'm finding the tissue expanders quite uncomfortable. It feels like I'm being slowly crushed. Well, I think the pain is coming from there anyway. Is this normal? Will this feeling ever go away? I'm also finding the whole having no sensation in my boobs thing very difficult to accept. Does this ever get easier? And I'm also concerned about what people have told me about implant reconstructions in terms of its painful to lie on your front afterwards permanently. Will I ever be able to have a back massage again or go on certain roller coasters? I just want to go back to some kind of normality but I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I know it's still early days but I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life. Will I ever feel like my reconstructed boobs are part of me and will they ever stop hurting? Thanks. x",

      "Content": "Hi Naz, I can't offer much support, but I just wanted to throw my personal choice into the mix... I'm very similar to you, I'm 28 and I'm yet to have children too. I've just finished chemo and I'm having my double mastectomy and the beginning stages of a staged reconstruction tomorrow. (And I'm petrified!) Admittedly, I've not discussed all the options through much with my consultants as I was pretty determined from the beginning. A DIEP flap is apparently out of the question for me as I don't have enough tissue to build me some new boobs, although this option was suggested to me initially. The back operation was a possibility but I didn't want anything that could leave me with a permanent weakness. Therefore, I have chosen to have implants. I made this decision purely based on less scaring, there will be no need to cut into healthy tissue and hopefully a shorter recovery time. I know the implants will probably not last the course of my lifetime and will possibly need replacing at some point in the future, and I know a staged implant reconstruction means that although I'll have boobs again within 2 months, the 'finished product' will probably be finished in around two years. But, for me, the pros outweighed the cons. x",

      "Content": "Oh Matt! Your wife sounds exactly like how I felt during this time! Honestly, I feel like my partner could have written this about me at the time! That's how similar it sounds. I found the period between chemo and surgery the most difficult time to get through emotionally. I felt very lost and I cried a lot. It felt like a waiting game until the surgery and that scared me. I too was triple negative (I had three tumours across both breasts but no lymph node involvement) and I had chemo before surgery.  Please reassure your wife this is completely normal. If she gets too concerned about the waiting time though, please get in touch with your breast care unit to voice your concerns. There is light at the end of the tunnel! I promise. It just doesn't feel like it at the moment. The job of the surgery is to get rid of the cancer so try not to worry about how much the chemo has affected things at the moment. The surgery will take care of the rest. I was always told that it was chemo's job to shrink it, and if it got rid of it completely it would be a bonus. It certainly wasn't expected. Thankfully for me, after the surgery I found out that chemo had got rid of two tumours completely and shrunk the third. Thankfully again, they got good surgical margins on the third lump so that has all gone now too. Please just give your wife lots of hugs!",
