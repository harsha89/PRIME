    "Content": "Good afternoon.  I have a very sort course of steroids each week for 3 days and intravenously with my treatment.  I experience puffiness in my face which (in the side effects leaflet) is described as \"moon face\" !. Nothing anywhere else unless I don't drink enough water. Sounds like you should speak to a medical professional  a GP might be a tall order on a Friday before a holiday ! there is an excellent advice line on here who I am sure will be able to give you some guidance. The number is on the front home page. I wish you luck and sending positive thoughts  Sam ",
