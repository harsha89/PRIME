      "Content": "Hi there, i think it all depends on how the radiotherapy affects you, mostly in terms of tiredness. I had a best friend who worked in an office in the morning, had her rads at lunchtime, and rested in the afternoon. She coped with this fine. But my sister, who is a hairdresser and Â on her feet all day was wiped out by her rads after a week and couldn\u2019t carry on. I\u2019m hoping for the best and that I\u2019m not too tired, but I won\u2019t beat myself up if I do need to rest. We are coping with a lot, physically and mentally and we need to be kind to ourselves. All the very best with the rest of your journey xx",

I wonder if I\u2019ll actually be starting the first 5 days or will it just be a chat? What should I expect from the radiotherapy? I haven\u2019t been given any information by my surgeon or breast clinic nurse and I\u2019m worried about side effects as my scars are still a bit sore. I had a Grisotti reconstruction. I\u2019d be grateful for any info or advice.",

I assume it\u2019s to start my radiotherapy treatment after breast cancer surgery - the letter doesn\u2019t say! Will my radiotherapy start straight away at this appointment or will it just be a discussion? I\u2019m not sure what to expect.",
