      "Content": "Hi to everybody who has bothered to reply to my post regarding this treatment, Thank you so much for the kind words and advice. I go for my chemo chat on Monday and treatment is due to start Wednesday. 6 x FEC. I am going to give the cold cap a go to try and do all I can to save the hair, which I have been trying to grow for the last years. Oh well! I have been extremely down this week, as dreading going into the unknown again and wondering what side effects this will give me and how I will be feeling. For the sake of my 3 girls, husband and family, I need to give it my best shot and have decided that if it is that bad, half way through, I will then tell them I am not having anymore. I did ask my ONC how many people refuse it and he said only handful of patients. Also on visitimg these sites and reading people's different situations, there are thousands of others all going through the same thing who get through it all and I need to stop feeling so sorry for myself lol. My children are all nearly grown up and cable of looking after themselves and I need to start thinking about me and staying positive. I will keep you all informed and thank you all once again. Liz, just want to add, it was reading your story that has probably swayed me the most in making my decision to have the chemo. It you do decide not to have it and it comes back, then you would be constantly wondering is it because you refused it. I wish you all the luck in the world. You are one brave woman x",

      "Content": "Hi All, I am also thinking about refusing chemo. Inv Ductal Cancer, Grade 3, Horm Positive, Size under 1cm, no node spread. Had second lumpectomy as 1st came back with one margin too close, but after 2nd op, all results clear. No further spread and 2nd piece had no maligancy at all. On Wed I saw the ONC and he is still recommending me to have chemo 6 x FEC, tamoxifon and rad treatment. Cant understand why chemo needed as no spread involved. He said because of age (43) they over treat and are probably being over cautious. My main concern is the hair loss and on doing research sems most having this type of chemo have complete loss. He has told me my stats which is 85.6% with no further treatment, an extra 4% with Tamoxifen, taking it to 90% and if I have chemo as well, this will increase to 93%. I also have a 1.5% of being run over etc. I am totally confused as he is saying as based on the above, although I have a very high non recurrance prognosis, the recommended treatment would still be the same. He has spoken about an alt course of treatment which would be Tamoxifan, Zoladex + 3 weeks of rads, which he has told me to go and have a think about it and I will see him again on Wednesday. Are all side effects of chemo worth it for only an extra 3% non return? Any advice would be very much appreciated. I have three children aged 19, 17 & 13 plus husband.",
