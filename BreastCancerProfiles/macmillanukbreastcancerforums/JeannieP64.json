      "Content": "Hi Lorraine  I've had 11 of 18 Herceptin so far and my problems with sensitive feet, puffy feet and swollen ankles and aching joints started during my FEC-T chemo - I was crippling about like a 90 year old.  The symptoms have improved a lot - my feet were so painful and sore that walking anywhere very far was not an option: I've now got some shoes with nice shaped and padded insoles which make things easier. My chemo kicked me into the menopause so knowing what is causing what has been interesting!  Like the other ladies, ibuprofen was helpful with the aching joints.  I find I just don't have the stamina to do as much physical stuff as previously before joints start complaining so pacing myself and resting often has become the norm. I've got a problem with a couple of my discs and pelvis currently which I picked up some new stronger painkillers for yesterday and that has made the world of difference.  The most difficult part of all of this is trying to unravel which particular treatment has caused which side effect.  Chemo, surgery, Herceptin, radiotherapy and quite a few scans have all added toxins at a cellular level to our bodies and they all carry side effects which can take a long time to subside and learning to live with them is the tricky part.  I wish you the very best of luck with yours and hope you can find something to ease things to make it more comfortable for you.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Mags I think Macmillan do a recipe book specifically for this - at least when I had my chemo last summer there were copies available at the Cancer Centre I was receiving treatment from.  May even be details for it somewhere on this site.  Your question about what to eat on the day - go with what your Mum feels like as it will depend on the chemo as to which side effects crop up.  I didn't feel like any food on the actual day or if anything about 6 hours afterwards just a quarter piece of toast with honey and just kept sipping water as all I felt like.  Little and often seemed to be the way for me and drinking is more important than the eating.  I felt nauseous and every thing tasted metallic so nothing tasted right. Eating wasn't uppermost in my mind - I just wanted to rest and sleep.  All the best to you and your Mum and hope her side effects are manageable.  ",
