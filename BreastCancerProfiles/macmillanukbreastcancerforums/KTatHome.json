So good that you clarified to Kacang, you might want to click on the + sign to leave the melanoma group it\u2019s just under the big heading.  Good luck with your op.",

      "Content": "Hello Tansi, welcome to the online community, I\u2019m sorry to hear about your Mum. I noticed that you hadn\u2019t had a reply yet and so thought I\u2019d pop in from the melanoma group to say hi. I was wondering if your question would be partly answered although not by personal experience, by this information Breast cancer info link it also gives the help line number if you want further info or just chat about what you are going through as a concerned relative. There are also a range of booklets about different cancers in the Publications and resources section I know you mentioned you were a nurse and wanting to research more about your Mums illness, so you may have already found these booklets that can be downloaded from the site.  I am a melanoma patient that had an unknown primary that spread to my abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes and then to my ovary.  I must say though that sometimes it is best to take one step at a time to expect the best until proven otherwise. There are too many what ifs sometimes that might not happen and can be scary. It may be of course that you feel in control having more info and getting yourself prepared and that a talk to the helpline 0808 808 0000 May be good for you it\u2019s open Monday to Friday 9am to 8pm.  Wishing you and your mum the best.",
