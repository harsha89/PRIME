      "Content": "Hi all . I have just started my Radio Therapy and am on day 3 .Boob is a little sore but really ok physically.Mt question is emotionally. I had my Operation on 15th September to remove my tumour and Lymp nodes .Got my results on 24th September Lobular cancer and need to operate again as not enough clearance but Lymp nodes clear.2nd op on 11th October and all sucesseful.Doctor said i would need Chemo and Radio and Tamoxifen. I was private so asked about Oncotype DX test which i had done .It came back that there was a small chance in the intermediate section that it would reoccur so i decided not to have Chemo. Since that diagnosis i have been so depressed and i cant stop crying.I did go back to work but could not cope so have decided that the month i am having treatment i am having off work , Im not sure if its the Tamoxifen or the fact that its finally hit me that i had Cancer ,Has anybody else found that Tamoxifen does this ?",
