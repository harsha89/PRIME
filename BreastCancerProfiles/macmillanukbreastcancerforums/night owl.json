    "Content": "Hi everyone I am new to this site, I had bc in 2003 ( aggresive form ) which did not feed of estrogen, had lumpectomy and some lymph glands removed, then chemo and radiotherapy. I took every side effect going with the chemo and radio but got through it. Problem is 5yrs on my health has deteriorated, im suffering from chronic fatigue ,aching joints, tremours,headaches, constant wrenching, weight loss, sleeplessness but the doctors keep sending me away with anti depressants even although I tell them im not depressed. I just wonder if anyone has experienced anything similar as im at my wits end as i had to give up my work in March due to this. Â ",
