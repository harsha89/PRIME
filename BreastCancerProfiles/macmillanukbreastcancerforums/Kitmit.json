      "Content": "Thanks Sally, it's what I keep telling myself. I don't think we would have reacted so poorly to a follow up if it wasn't for the last cancer being so recent. I'm hoping that if it is cancer its in the precancerous stages since nothing showed on the PET scan recently.  At least we get news on the Wednesday, last time it took 2 weeks to get the news. ",

      "Content": "I'm hoping people can help us in this stressful time. My mother was recently diagnosed with a very rare form of anal cancer. Although it was started to spread out. She had a very intense treatment period that luckily ended with the cancer regressing to nothing.  Before her treatment, she was given a series of scans and tests, including PET. This showed except for large benign cysts on her ovaries (which she now has to have removed too) that she was clear everywhere else. Fast forward a month and she's finally relaxing knowing that all she has left is this key hole surgery for the cysts. She gets a letter in the post asking her to come for a mammogram. She doesn't want to go because she's mentally exhausted and recovering from her last cancer but the Doctor said the PET won't pick up precancerous cells in the breast. Now we get a letter in the post saying she has to come back for a second test and my mother is naturally in floods of tears asking if it will ever stop.  Could it really be cancer after the PET scan or is it more likely to be precancerous? She has no symptoms of breast cancer although she has had surgery for cysts in the past so I'm curious if they're just detecting scar tissue? When she called for reassurance they said the PET scan means nothing and she could still have cancer. I'm finding it hard to raise her mood, I just can't believe we have to go through all this again and so soon. Thank you in advance.  ",
