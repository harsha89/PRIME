It's been quite a year and bizarre I guess that it actually happened!  Am also on Letrazole after turfing the awful Tamoxifen aside! Do check with different brands as I started with Accord Letrazole and then got Sandoz, which definitely gave me side effects, one being feeling almost suicidally depressed! So I'm back on the Accord and hoping the mood lifts - perhaps, apart from discovering the lump, this is part of the reason for you feeling hopeless? Worth a change just in case. I think too, that once you have been through this, life is different, one sees things in a different way and sometimes it feels very hard and strange and 'boring'. So my heart goes out to you and so do many ho-ho-ho's for a happy time and all good things and send much healing and love. Try cheer up xx hugs x",

I had crystallised ginger, ginger beer, ginger ale - ginger helps with the nausea. Maybe some nuts? Anything that is easy and convenient and hopefully nourishing. When you feel a bit perkier, pop to the shops and get a stock of things. I aslo made huge pots of homemade vegetable soup - loads of veges!!! - which I froze in portion sizes. Easy to defrost and heat and actually really comforting to eat. Hang in there missy - it's quite an experience, so don't push yourself, just take your time, sleep, let your body make the decisions for ouyr brain at the moment - body tired - body rests and sleeps!

      "Content": "It's odd how some of these doctors treat you but don't seem to understand what you are actually going through!!! I wrote to the oncology dept after my chemo as I didn't want my experience to be for nothing - so thought at least my thoughts would stop anyone going through some of the dreadful stuff I did, which I felt could have been made more pleasant i.e. being given my FEC via cannula direct from the fridge !!! OUCH !!! I also asked my GP to re-refer me to the Marsden, a dedicated cancer hospital, as I felt my oncologist didn't listen to what I had to say, thus knocking my confidence in her and causing me unecessary extra stress ! My first appointment at the Marsden I was seen by a Registrar as well as 2 consultants who the Reg asked to look at my arm with all the thrombosed veins - something no-one told me could happen!!! How scared was I when the veins first when tight and concave in my arm! Plus they said it looked as if slight extravasation had occured - definitely NOT good ! They also scanned my arm to rule out clots and were very thorough with me which I very much appreciated. My reason for the re-referal was because the Tamoxifen was making me feel permanently hung over and tired - to the extent I was always yawning at work, and my weekends were spent reading and sleeping and never wanting to go out, in bed by 8-30 every night too and sleeping well.  Those were the better days after my body adjusted to it! I also feel like my eyesight has been affected slightly.... So I decided to stop taking it, but needed to be monitored which is what has happened. It took about 3 weeks of no Tamoxifen to wake up on a Saturday at 0800 and think - Yippee, let's go out and do something :-)  !!!!! Plus I feel brighter mentally. Maybe you should consider getting re-referred? My quality of life is almost what it was before this dreadful experience. I finished chemo in April and rads June 17th. IF I am post meopausal when I have my next appointment, I may try Anastrozole, but if I feel bad on that after 3 months, I will go it with nature! I'm so sorry to hear you had a mini stroke, and everything else that you are going through :-( You deserve to receive decent, caring treatment, so don't give up until you get it xxxxxx lots of love and hugs and healing - I so hope you start picking up and feeling more positive - having a good mindset can only help xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Well ! You are understandably anxious! This is a big thing to go through ! Your first appointment with your oncologist will be to discuss your options i.e. chemotherapy. They will check you over, examine you, make sure you are well enough to start treatment. You will probably have to have bloods taken to check they are normal too - this usually is the day before your oncology appoinment so that they can put the script through to pharmacy for your drugs - actually, I am not 100% sure I had bloods taken prior to my first oncology appointment ???? Can't remember now ! Just take a really deep breath and relax and ask as many questions as you want so that you feel confident and okay with what is going on. I was quite flippant and kind of erred on the side of ignorance is bliss so sailed into chemo 1 :-) You also have a breast care nurse with you throughout your journey - hopefully she is as wonderful as mine was - she really listened to my problems, unlike my oncologist ! The sooner you start, the sooner you will complete the treatment and before you know it, it will all be over. Just make sure the drugs are room temperature before they give them to you as it makes a huge difference to your comfort level. They are stable at room temp - I investigated ! Have ginger at the ready in case you feel nauseous after chemo - ginger - biscuits, ale, beer, tea !!!! Drink loads of water to flush out the chemo when you're done each cycle. I think once you get started, you will get into the flow. Sending much love and hugs and healing - hope it all goes as smoothly as possible xxxx",

I got my honey via Amazon - 3 for £60 - expensive, but in this situation, worth every penny! Chemo - make sure it's room temperature before they give it to you if you have a cannula otherwise it is really unpleasant!

Just do NOT ever let them put the drugs in cold as happened to me - that was truly the end of my faith in the chemo nurses! It should be room temperature at least! I massaged essential oils into my hand and arm and also used a hot water bottle on my arm when they put the drugs in. It did make it a little more comfy.  Also used the cold cap - brilliant!! Hair did go weird and very dry though - knotted when I washed it and went into clumps which I couldn't undo, so I took my sewing scissors and did the wild thing - looked quite sweet and my lovely hairdresser tidied up my attempt. Hair short was so much easier to deal with and now it is back to it's thick glory!  My word !!! Is this not a journey and a half to go through!!?

More interesting is that our hospital policy doesn't think the same, and although I was off throughout my chemo, I returned 2 weeks after rads ended with a phased return over 4 weeks which oncology were horrified to hear.

I had loads of hair to start with, did lose quite a bit, but it was definitely a respectable hairdo! I did chop it off short (with my sewing scissors - later tidied up by my lovely hairdresser :-)  ) though as it tangled into clumps when I washed it - also hated short hair, but short hair is better than no hair :-) I think it helps you to maintain some form of normalcy...it did for me. When you wash it, just be very gentle, use natural shampoos - Faith in Nature / Jason - as they don't have all the usual chemicals. Some people suggest you cut it shorter to 'lighten the weight' - less pull on the roots. Good luck with it all.

I stayed really positive through surgery and then had chemo and radiation and have just decided to stop Tamoxifen as I didn't like it ! Everyone is so different in how they approach the diagnosis and how they feel. My feeling is that however you think, it is a very overwhelming and frightening experience, but if you can try and be a positive as humanely possible, it will definitely make the process a little more bearable. I was amazed by the support I received from people who I thought didn't even like me that much! Make sure you have people around you who love and care about you as they will help keep you mentally strong and feeling very special :-) It sounds like your family are already around you to help create that loving and 'powderpuff' cloud for you to float on and help you through this, so let them. Be kind to yourself and give your body and mind any time they need and never feel guilty if you can't get things done or feel whacked out and sleep all the time ! We had no cancer in our family so my having it was so unexpected. One really important piece of advice for you - when / if you have chemo, make sure they let the drugs reach room temperature before they are administered to you as otherwise it can be very unpleasant! Also, keep a diary as that way you can refer back to previous days to see how you felt, what you ate, took, drank etc, what helps, what aggravates etc I used the Digncap (coldcap) and managed to keep a really respectable amount of hair !!! Worth a try :-)  Good luck - lots of love and hugs and healing, and hope it all goes well xxxxxx                                            ",

      "Content": "After my experience at a S.W.London hospital - my surgeon was fantastic and faultless and supported me the whole way. My oncology experience however left much to be desired. After treatment I wrote to the department in the hopes that no-one would ever have to go through some of the things I did! Awful and unneccessary. I finally asked my GP to re-refer me to the Marsden in Chelsea as I had no confidence left in my previous medical team. The whole atmosphere is different, I was treated as a patient, not a number, all very personal, was seen by 2 consultants and a registrar, sent for scans, listened to and supported in my thoughts and concerns. They are interested. So important - I wish I had had all my oncology at this hospital! If you are concerned now, and have received bad or brush-off treatment to date, don't hesitate to get re-referred. It's a long journey so I think you need to be comfortable where you go, confident, and as happy as possible throughout. Plus I do think the fact the Marsden is a cancer hospital definitely makes a difference.   Good luck - sending hugs and healing and lots of love xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Mina. I think everyone is different but I don't think many people sail through this - it is CRAP For the nausea, try drinking ginger beer / ginger ale. Eat ginger - Holland and Barrett sell crystallised ginger - quite hot but it does help with nausea. Drink LOTS of liquids to flush your system - I found water tasted dreadful so had fruit juices and cordials - try Bottle Green or Rocks orange - YUMMY and neither have additives. Luckily I never vomited but felt really nauseous and hungover-like and was lucky to have a good appetite. Chopped fresh fruit and natural yoghurt is also soothing - the yoghurt will be good for your tummy and help the natural bacteria. The chemo does affect the digestive tract ( all fast producing cells ) from mouth to bottom. I know when I pooed it felt like I had swallowed and passed raw almonds - not pleasant!!!! My eyes grew big at toilet time in anticipation!!!! Apply some cream to your bottom to keep the skin soft - I got disposable gloves and chopped the fingers off one by one so a glove did 5 applications of cream!! Try diprobase or sudocrem. I also got my GP to prescribe Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash as I got ulcers and it really helped! Also gargled with salt water or corsodyl - diluted about 10 to 1 as it burnt ! And eyedrops - as my eyes burnt and were very sore. Also, I read up on Life-Mel honey which is meant to help boost the immune system - my white cells after cycle 1 were 0.7, cycle 2, after self-injecting with Filagrastim (OW!) they improved to 1.9 - should be over 1.5 for chemo to go ahead - and I swear this helped boost it! I chatted to another lady about it and she took Manuka Honey - 20= strength and reckoned it also boosted her immune levels. Very worth a try. I am heading to my last chemo this Friday thank my lucky stars!! Never again!! :-( Just hang in there - there is so much useful info online!. And good luck xxxxx  - I hope you get some help with this - wish I could wave a magic wand and send it all away :-) Bless and sending lots of healing to you xxxx",

I think the funniest thing was losing my hair in my nether regions - what a funny sight - but what a pleasure it was when I went on holiday and didn't have to check for stray hairs - ha ha!!!! You GO girl !",

I ate pate through first chemo and then was told it was a no-no....did have eggs though - hard boiled, omelettes etc. Good luck with everything - hope you thrive and stay well xxxx",
