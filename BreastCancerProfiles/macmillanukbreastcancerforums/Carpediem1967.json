      "Content": "Hi i\u2019m recovering well from a recent mastectomy with mesh/expanding implant. T2 x2, N2 with 4 of 22 nodes, currently MX pending MRI on liver following something showing on a CT scan. Pretty scared right now, I was feeling positive about fighting this, believing it was primary cancer but now it might not be. I\u2019m told that CT scans can show up all sorts on the Liver, not necessarily cancer and I wondered if anyone had any experiences they could share? Thank you x",
