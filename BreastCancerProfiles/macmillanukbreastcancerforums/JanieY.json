    "Content": "Hi. I had my mastectomy on 1st February 2016. Just wear ordinary clothes - something easy to put on and take off. Mine was the left side and I was t restricted at all in my movements. The only thing I would say is to make sure the drain tube isn't taped down to tightly. Otherwise it could be painful when the painkillers and anaesthetic wears off. Best of luck and try not to worry.",
