    "Content": "So, I am two months post - surgery,  Stage 2 Grade 2 ILC, negative nodes, oncotype score 15 so no chemo, contraindicated for radio because of basal cell carcinoma (skin), taking tamoxifen but very fearful of recurrence in the other breast. I was very sure I would remove the other breast and have double reconstruction in due course but my family is worried about the risks involved in the extended surgery and three wound sites rather than two.  I am not sure I will be able to relax sufficiently if I keep my other breast, as I don't trust screening methods (mammogram negative and US inconclusive, diagnosis confirmed by biopsy only).  Naturally I don't want to lose a breast if I don't really need, but I am scared to take the risk of recurrence in the other breast, given that ILC is a sneaky little cancer with 20% contralateral recurrence risk. So this has become a dilemma now and I'm finding it hard to move forward.  Anyone else out there had or have the same choice to make? ",
