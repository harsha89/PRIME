      "Content": "Hi fern2018, thanks for sharing your experience, really helps to hear from other people who are going through this journey.  I'm in London but new to the city having relocated to the uk only weeks ago, so still trying to figure out a lot of things. Will definitely look into hairdressers. I bought a beautiful wig here, I don't even think most people can tell when I'm wearing it, but so far I find it really difficult to get used to it. So really hoping to keep my hair.  I am too trying fasting. I didn't know it can help with hair loss too but heard from various people that it helped them manage the immediate side effects like nausea. They also told me it helped reduce the impact of chemo on their immune system and they had perfect blood test results throughout. Hope it works for you too. I've been told I'm strong for starting a new job as I go through this, but I actually feel it's more a sign of weakness, as for me it's a way to distract myself and pretend everything is fine. I admire those who took it as a chance to slow down and concentrate on taking care of themselves. For me, taking a break from work means being alone with my thoughts and getting sucked in negative thoughts. So I really admire those who can take cancer as an opportunity. Thanks for the kind words and wish you all the best in your journey. As you said, it will pass. Take care.",

      "Content": "Hi Fern, and all  I just came back to see how you're all coping with chemo as well as hair loss. I was finding it quite hard during EC as the side effects started accumulating and, honestly, was struggling to cope with tje whole situation, emotionally. Now I've moved on to Taxol, which is so much more bearable, and also means I'm more than halfway through treatment. Starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I hope everyone on this thread is feeling okay! I also wanted to say that despite the hair fall, I decided to continue with scalp cooling as I had heard that, even though your hair still falls, the hat prevents follicles from dying. So I'm still using it, and my hair started to grow back the moment I stopped EC, even though I'm still doing taxol now. It's growing back very thick and quickly, and the remaining hair has stopped falling, so I think it was worth for me after all.  I was given paracetamol before using the hat in order to reduce the pain, but it wasn't really helping me. Then one nurse suggested I took Co Codamol instead, along with a really really small dose (I really don't like medications that make me drowsy) of Lorazepam, and with that the discomfort was absolutely bearable. So maybe ask your doctor or nurse if it can be prescribed. Wishing you all happy holidays and a speedy recovery!",

      "Content": "Hi Becci1001, it's been over 5 years so don't know if you'll be reading this but was just curious to know how the cold cap worked for you? Also, more importantly, how are you feeling overall?  I just started chemo 2 weeks ago and have still a long way to go (6 months of chemo + radiotheraphy and surgery). Right now so difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel, even though so many people tell me life will go back to normal. Hair means a lot to me. Not a matter of vanity, but as other said in this forum - I really can't stand the sorry faces and special treatment. I also just started a new job this week and didn't feel ready to share about my condition with so many people I don't know. So, although I haven't lost my hair yet, I've started wearing a wig right away so I wouldn't have to explain the sudden change if I do end up losing my hair. The wig looks beautiful but I hate it - gives me headaches, and makes my scalp very itchy. I can barely wear it for 10 hours a day. So I'm still hanging on the hope that my hair won't fall off.  thanks",

Now it's a week later, and I've lost about 70% of them and I'm guessing within another couple of days they'll all be gone. Having said that, I don't want to discourage anyone from still trying - I'm glad I did and I think it's worth trying as it's working for so many people.  best wishes to you too and hope your chemo is going well! take care",
