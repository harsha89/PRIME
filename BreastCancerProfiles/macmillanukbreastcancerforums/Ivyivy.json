      "Content": "Many thanks for this. I don't have my preliminary appointment until next week so at the moment know nothing. I am just hoping the chemo will be better than last time. List of tips was useful. For those going through it now, my experience taught me that it does end and eventually it is as if it never happened. So good courage and every sympathy for now. ",
