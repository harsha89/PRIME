      "Content": "Hi all :)  A little late to the party...but i had my first RT yesterday. Was all little bit odd, a big machine, and back to the Oncology unit after being 14 weeks since my last chemo.  Feeling a little anxious as have been feeling back to normal (except the odd anxiety attack about this spot of bother we appear to find ourselves in) but generally have been feeling very well.   So 1 session down 19 to go!  How are you lovely lot getting on?  xx",

      "Content": "thought i would tell you a bit about me and my journey while we are here... I haven't really used these boards very much.  So a bit about me...  I'm 34, currently have a husband and two dogs in tow for this little ride. :) Found a lump whilst holidaying in Bude in September 2017 (wasn't overly concerned as I'm quite lumpy generally and had been to Breast clinic a few times before only to be told various lumps were fibroadenomas)  Went this time, they didn't think it was anything  but did a scan and a biopsy, I think i knew at that point it was more than nothing as I felt the mood in the room change when i was having the scan ....when we went back for the results were not nothing... turns out it was a something.... 20mm invasive ductal carcinoma ... diagnosis was 'probably grade 2' (probably!!) FNA of nodes came back clear. ER negative and HER2 positive 8 rounds of chemo, 4 rounds of the flavour, EC, then 4 rounds of the second flavour Docetaxel, Pertuzamab and Herceptin, followed by herceptin on its own for another 13 goes! Thankfully as subcut as my veins really had had enough by that point.  End MRI showed a complete radiological response - and then I had my lumpectomy and sentinel nodes out. Confirmed completed pathological response, and clear nodes.  20 sessions of radiotherapy from 2nd July, 15 general boob zappings and 5 boosters!!  Hopefully nearing the end of this spot of bother with cancer, and trying to push any negative thoughts to the back of my mind. Happy to be back at work and back motorhoming at weekends, and trying to move on and not let this define me.  I'm using the Norwegian Formula Cream - was my usual body lotion so was told to stick with it. so lets see how it goes!  Here's to another sunny day, hope you are all well xx Jen xx",

      "Content": "hi everyone - hope you are all doing ok.  Im mid way through my 4 weeks of radiotherapy. I\u2019ve had 8 cycles of chemo and lumpectomy and slnb (came back clear nodes) and I showed a complete pathological response to chemo.  And I have my ongoing herceptin injections till the end of December.  About 5 weeks ago I went back to work full time after my phases return... then joy of joys my monthly visit from Aunt Flo returned the following week (I\u2019m her2 pos and er negative) my onco told me that they would come back because of my age (35) I just didn\u2019t expect them this quickly.  Now since then... I have felt absolutely exhausted, like I\u2019m kind of drunk, floating through each day, can\u2019t concentrate, almost dizzy like. Am I doing too much? It seemed to ease of a couple of weeks ago then two days into my period last week, boom the exhausted woozy feeling was back, almost like I\u2019m in a dream?  Now I have read a lot about fatigue, is this what I\u2019m feeling? Im trying my best not to absolutely freak out, but I can\u2019t help thinking this is something awful xx",
