      "Content": "Hi I had breast cancer op on 1st December 2011 follow by chemo and radio. I was told I had triple negative cancer. Everything was going well was well and came out the other side. I started getting back pain first they said it was my body settling down from the chemo but to do test. Had ct scan, bone scan and mri. went for results on 9th december 2012 only to be told I have secondly cancer on the spine and because it as come within 6 month of chemo it is very aggressive and they don't know how long I have got.  They want me to go on the above but I have refused because I have always said if they can't say it will give me an extra year or two then why make myself sick. They said all it may do is take some of the pain away. I don't know what to do, at the moment I am still walking (with a little pain ) and on pain killers and i still work  which my boss said my job is still there all the time I can do it. I have appointment Tomorrow to see if I will have radio, but that is again another pain killer and it won't be able to get all the cancer growth because I have lots of little ones as well as big one at the bottom of my spine and a large one near my neck. Please tell me what some of you think because I am now lost myself in the sea of information. Love Maureen55  ",

I just kept crying and my husband was sitting there looking at me as if I had gone mad when all I wanted was a hug. when I finally got him to talk he said your alright you got lots of people to talk to and group to support you I got nothing. So I found canerwise near me in Chichester and they have chats for partners of cancer people. See if there is something near you and ask him if this is what wrong he has no man to talk to.",

      "Content": "Hi (((((((((((BIG HUG))))))))))) it seems to get better. Has for your smoking go to your gp my husband was given tablets to help him stopped. They did the trick,( but I don't know if you can take them while having chemo). Since you may have to wait six weeks after op for chemo they may give them to you. With the tablet you smoke the first week and in the second week they seem to make you stop, my husband have not smoke for over a year. Sorry to hear about your brother when you want him near you think of the good times you had together I hope that helps. Maureen xx",
