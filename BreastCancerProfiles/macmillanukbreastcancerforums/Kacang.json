Here is the link to the press release, which in turn has links to the study. Having said that, I absolutely agree that whether to have chemo is about the likely benefit.",

      "Content": "Hi Emagermain I'm so sorry to hear you're still suffering 3 years after treatment. That must make life really difficult for you. I'm 2 years post diagnosis and still get the occasional bout of fatigue, if I overdo it, but I'm generally pretty well.  Do you take tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane)? They can have some nasty side effects like joint and muscle stiffness and a lot of people complain about how old they feel.  If you're not taking one of these hormone blockers, then it might be about time to get your blood checked. You might be anaemic or lacking in one of the basic minerals like potassium or magnesium. All those things can cause excessive tiredness. Bottom line is that it's not \"normal\" to be fatigued for so long (my docs told me up to 2 years), and you don't need to put up with it. Go to your GP and demand some help. Wishing you all the best. ",

I didn't have shoulder problems nor tamoxifen so I can't comment on those but I did have PN, mostly in my hands. In fact, my onco stopped my paclitaxel after 9 out of 12 sessions as it was pretty serious. By then I had almost completely numb left hand and all my fingers of the right hand were numb and the palm was tingly. He told me that as long as the numbness doesn't start moving up your arm, the PN should be reversible.  Well, it is now 11 months since I finished T and the PN in my right hand has completely gone. In fact that had gone within 6 months. The left hand is fine too, except for slight tingling in 3 fingers - nothing that interferes with using my hand for anything, including microtasks like threading a needle. I think the hand has been pretty much like that for the last 6 months, so maybe the tingling will always be there but it doesn't matter. So the upshot of that ramble is that you should be more or less back to normal within 6 months, but it will get easier before then.  Best Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Nickynoodle. Welcome aboard the roller coaster. Of course you're scared - getting a cancer diagnosis is one of the scariest things that can happen to anyone. I can assure you, however, that once you have a treatment plan in place, things will settle down and soon you'll be an old lag, giving everyone else advice.  It's not easy making a lumpectomy/mastectomy decision, and then if you decide to go for mastectomy whether to have reconstruction. I guess the first step is to be sure you have enough information. There's some really good info on the main Macmillan site about breast surgery. I suggest you read that and make notes of any questions. You can then go back to your BCN or surgeon and ask them. There might be lovely ladies here who can answer some too, but not the medical ones of course. Remember too, you don't need to agree to anything unless and until you're absolutely certain.  I started out having a saved skin mastectomy with implant. However, for a long and complicated reasons, I ended up having to have the implant removed. By then I was so over it all, I told my surgeon to just chop it off. I now live my life as lopsided Lizzie and I couldn't be happier with it. In fact I dislike the floppy boob that's left far more than the side that has no boob. My husband didn't mind what I chose - he's just glad I'm well and happy.  Hope it all goes well for you. ",

To get medicinal value from it, get the highest UMF grade you can (UMF is a grading system see http://www.umf.org.nz/) but at least 10. The UMF mark is also an indication of authenticity ie that it's genuine NZ manuka honey, not Tesco's finest in disguise. Others have previously said you can get it from Holland and Barrett in the UK. Otherwise try health food shops or possibly large pharmacies.  Nothing to do with cancer but my brother had a large (50p piece sized) ulcer on his arm after a serious car accident. It just wouldn't heal for 2 years. But then 6 weeks slathering it every day with manuka honey and it was totally healed.That was enough to convince me. I asked about manuka honey while on chemo and was told it's ok but you may wish to check with your unit.  By the way Aneesa1 - keep a very close eye on that temperature. Some units (including the one I went to) say 37.5 as their go to A&E' cut off point. It's certainly high enough to show that you have an infection. As we know, infection is THE highest risk with chemo, and yes, I do mean to scare you, just a bit. Best",

I do take calcium/D3 and magnesium, the former as I am taking anastrozole and the latter because I'm taking diuretics, which reduces the level of magnesium in my blood. Both were 'prescribed' by my oncologist.  I have a generally healthy diet (loads of veggies, some fruit, high quality protein including legumes, low carb), try to abstain from sugary and other junk food, and no alcohol (again cos of other meds). I bought an exercise bike as I hate walking and am religious about my 20 mins per day with intervals.  I finished chemo in January and radio in May but my low point was October 2015 when I spent a month in hospital, including 2 weeks in ICU. Overall I feel fantastic and I think I'm fitter than I have been for at least 15 years if not longer. Probably helps that I lost about 5 stone over my 12 month cancer journey.  So the moral of my story is that you don't need to be extreme but you do need to be consistent and committed. So you need to work out what you'll be able to stick with long term.  Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

They were terrible at first but after about a year they slowed and then eventually stopped. I can't remember the last one. So I can't say if acupuncture would help. I do have heaps of sympathy for you though as it can be quite debilitating. ",

      "Content": "Hi Trojan50 that all sounds rather overwhelming!  Despite all the negatives, in a funny way you're lucky as you've been monitored so problems have been picked up early. None of these decisions is easy. Some of us have chosen to take every treatment that's offered and some have rejected eg chemo or mastectomy.  It's a bumpy ride and every type of treatment can have its problems but the thing is over 90% of us survive at least 5 years and those that don't were mostly diagnosed too late, were very old or had other health issues.  Have you been told what type of BC you have - hormone positive or negative, HER2 positive or negative? These factors can make a great difference to the agressiveness of the cancer and the type of treatment. It sounds like you're hormone positive as it seems from what you've said that you've been offered long term \"tablets\".  Long term hormone therapy is designed to reduce the amount of oestrogen in your body to starve the cancer of oestrogen. They're an extremely effective treatment. It'll put you into menopause if you're not already, so you're likely to get some of those symptoms eg achey joints, hot flushes.  If you're HER2+, then herceptin is a very effective treatment but it's only licensed for use in association with chemo. HER2+ cancer is aggressive though, so the docs are strongly in favour of having treatment.  As far as a double mastectomy goes, well surgery is also effective and these days many women opt for reconstruction. Not quite the same but most are pleased with the outcome. I suggest you do a bit of research on the various options, sticking to known and trusted sites like here, the cancer research UK site and the equivalent American ones. If you're into scientific research, the best site is the NIH site from the US. You should also talk to your family and/or close friends - that support is important to your general wellbeing. Finally, I agree you won't be the same but it is possibly to find a happy, balanced and contented new you. Most of us have, even if it was a long journey. Wishing you all the very best with your decisions. Lynn xx",

Haven't been around much recently but I thought you'd be interested to hear about my acupuncture experience.  Last oncologist visit in March, I was whingeing and moaning as usual about the SEs from Arimidex - bone pain, muscle pain, tendon and ligament pain. My onco suggested trying acupuncture. He said there's been some research done in the US and it works for about 40% of people. So, with some cynicism, I have given it a go.  I can happily report that I'm a complete convert. It's made an amazing difference. Hardly any aches or pains any more, unless I really overdo it. The pains I had in my hips has completely disappeared and my lower back is good most days. No more tendonitis in my hands. I can move much more freely and feel about 10 years younger.  Cheers",

      "Content": "Hi Regency  Welcome aboard. A cancer diagnosis is one of the scariest things around. But don't despair, breast cancer is very very treatable and if your mum is grade 2, she should be fine.Over 90% of people survive more than 5 years.  It won't be easy. She'll definitely have to have surgery and may have radiotherapy and chemo as well. Chemo will largely depend on the kind of cancer it is. There's one particular kind - HER2+ - where you definitely have to have chemo so you can have a special therapy targeted to that kind of cancer. Chemo isn't always given in other situations. If her cancer is not HER2+ then she needs to have a detailed discussion with her oncologist (when she gets to see him or her) about whether chemo is appropriate given her age. Sometimes chemo offers only a small benefit and it might not be worth having it, as the side effects can be quite severe for some people. The onco can guide you through that particular maze and we're here to try to answer any further questions you or she may have. Wishing you and your mum all the best for successful treatment.",

      "Content": "Hi Kate2017 Finding a lump is one of the scariest things we can go through and nothing any of us can say will make that fear go away.  However, you can manage the fear/panic/worry whatever you want to call it. Remember worry makes a burden twice as heavy. Keep yourself busy doing things that interest you. Take that worry out every so often, inspect it, then put it away. The main thing is that you have done something about your pains - if either of the lumps turns out to be breast cancer, you're already on the road to recovery simply by having had it diagnosed.  Just one word of warning. Monday isn't the end of it. The samples taken will need to be sent to the pathology lab for analysis. You should be given an appointment to see the doctor to get the results, usually in about two weeks. Do think about taking someone with you to that appointment, as many people have said they didn't hear anything after the word cancer. If it is cancer, you'll be told some details of the pathology at that meeting and you should be given an outline of the treatment being proposed. There's plenty more after that but one step at a time. Don't start worrying about treatment before you even get a diagnosis. Here's hoping your stay with us will be short. Big hugs",

I had a lot of health problems after the first part (AC) of chemo, including the BGL issue. When I'd recovered and came to have the T part of chemo and Herceptin, I asked my onco if I could have it without any steroids. He wouldn't agree because of the potential allergic reaction to T. However, he did lower my dose to the absolute minimum - I had 4 mg delivered by infusion just prior to T. Nothing before and no tablets to take home. Even with that small dose, my BGL would shoot up to about 17 from around 7 and take 48 hours to come back down. It made absolutely no difference what I ate. Do speak to your onco about reducing the dose if you still have any chemo treatments to go.  I have been left with diabetes, but it is well controlled with drugs and causes me few issues. I lost a fair bit of weight during the whole cancer treatment experience and I'm hoping that if I lose even more the diabetes situation will improve. The main dietary change I've made is to eat way fewer carbs. That seems to be the only thing that makes any difference to my BGL.",

I've recently come out the other end of 18 months of treatment, including one really rough patch. My husband was by my side all the time. He cried, he had temper tantrums and he had his foul moods but he was there. That's the important thing. No one can or should keep up a brave face all the time - how can you when awful things are happening to someone you love? And showing emotion is not weak.  My husband has said that the hardest bit was dealing with the 'blokes are supposed to fix things' part of his brain when on this occasion he couldn't fix it for me. Once I realised this was an issue for him, I gave him jobs to do and he turned into my chauffeur, bed maker, chief researcher and wielder of the vacuum cleaner.  So be there for her, do stuff around the house, ask her if there's anything she wants and most importantly love her. Little surprise presents won't go astray either.  To end on a positive note, I can definitely say that me having breast cancer treatment has brought us closer together. Life is good. Best Lynn xx",

Sadly, I find it hard to believe that the consultant would've told you it's BC if he had doubts. Usually they're pretty closed-mouthed until they're sure. More likely the biopsy is for confirmation and to identify the kind of BC ie whether it's hormone or HER2 positive. That will determine the treatment you are prescribed. i guess there's always room for a miracle though! I have found this site so helpful - being able to check things with people who have been through it, learn from them and yes rant if necessary. Everyone here understands and the community champions are great.  Wishing you all the very best, be kind to yourself. Lynn xx",

I'm sure you can appreciate that no one can diagnose over the internet and anyway, I have no medical training whatsoever lol. I do know though that lymph nodes can misbehave for all sorts of reasons - their sole function is to trap nasties (eg bacteria, viruses, and yes cancer cells) to stop them spreading round the body, and this entrapment often causes swelling. When I was a kid, my mother and grandmothers were for ever  checking for \"swollen glands\" if I had a cold or sore throat - I expect yours were too! So don't panic but do mention it to your onco at your appointment.  Do you have any antiseptic cream especially an iodine based one? If so, try putting some of that on your rash. That's what my GP advised when I had a rash on my leg (although not related to cancer treatment). It worked. If it gets really bad then I'd suggest ringing the NHS 111 helpline (if you're in England). Wishing you all the best.",

I did still have considerable fatigue during paclitaxel and also got quite bad peripheral neuropathy, mainly in my hands. So much so that I stopped after 9 of the 12 treatments. There's research that suggests that exercise makes chemo easier to get through, with fewer side effects, but don't push yourself too hard! I was able to use my exercise bike during paclitaxel, but only about 15 mins before I'd be knackered. Absolutely the most important thing is to keep your fluids up - I did 3 litres in the 24 hours post treatment and 2 litres every other day.  I don't know about working as I didn't have to. However, I don't think I could have managed to hold down a job during that period. I was far too tired. You get a better result with a taxane plus herceptin than either on its own. I too wondered why bother with the T but I was convinced by the research results.  Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

I went into respiratory arrest but fortunately I was already in a large teaching hospital and they were able to keep me alive and get me to ICU immediately. I was a code blue just like on telly lol. Despite that, I went on to have the second tranche of chemo - paclitaxel plus 12 months of herceptin. I never for a moment thought of quitting because I knew that HER2+ breast cancer is sneaky, aggressive and likely to recur.  Rather than talking to your onco with a predetermined idea that you'll stop after 4 rather than 6 treatments, why not tell him that you know people are often given 4 treatments and ask him to explain why he thinks you should have 6. I think that might be a better approach to an open discussion. It's still up to you of course but you do need to make a decision armed with all possible information.  T can be very hard on some people. There might be an option to reduce the dose or, if it works for you, to switch from the 3 weekly docetaxel to the weekly paclitaxel. The SEs are not so heavy but the outcomes are the same.  Wishing you all the best.",

For me the dex actually caused me to become diabetic and at the worst point my BGL was up in the 30s. This was only discovered half way through chemo (when I had finished the AC part). When I came to have the T part, I argued long and hard with my oncologist as I didn't want to have any steroids at all. In the end we compromised and he gave me the minimum dose - 4mg infused prior to the chemo infusion and no tablets before or afterwards.

I think he said something along the lines of don't even think of dieting... but he did encourage me to avoid junk food. I'm not sure I managed that though as hot chips were one of the few foods I could tolerate and enjoy.  I guess my best advice is to listen to your body. It's highly likely you will fancy some foods that you don't normally eat - for one person on this forum it was milk shakes (a person that doesn't normally like milk) and for me it was fresh orange juice.

      "Content": "Hi Lamonsea. It sounds like you've had a pretty rough time of it so far but it also sounds like you are a bit confused about some elements of your treatment and have little faith in your treating doctors. I think you need to take a deep breath, unpick the different bits and then take it one step at a time. Firstly, if you're not satisfied with your treatment, you're entitled to ask for a second opinion (see info here) or complain to the PALS unit. Are there other hospitals nearby where you could be treated. Do you have a BCN right now? If not, ask for one. If you do then talk to her about all these issues. Secondly, if you've had your surgery, the cancer is gone. Chemo, hormone therapy and radiation are about making sure it doesn't come back. Thirdly, if you're waiting for an oncotype test, then it's not certain that you'll need chemo. When you get those results then it's time to talk to the oncologist about chemo and/or hormone treatment. I would be massively surprised if they agreed to give you palbociclib as that's only been approved for metastatic cancer treatment at this stage. Chemo can be horrible but it isn't dreadful for everyone. Some people sail through - who's to say you can't be one of those people? And even those that find it tough think it's doable. You are of course entitled to refuse chemo but I strongly urge you to have a detailed conversation about the risks and benefits with your oncologist before you make any decision. Fourthly, the longer you delay treatment, the more likely it is that your cancer will return. You say there has already been several months delay. Why would you delay further? Your children will need you in their lives for a long time yet. All your children are of an age where they can help you and take some responsibility for themselves. It's time for them to step up.  Finally, over 90% of people who get breast cancer survive for at least 5 years. That's the only statistic you need to focus on.  People here are very kind and happy to support you. Please do hang around. Wishing you all the best.",

BTW I think I read that a massive proportion of the population doesn't get enough Mg - I think it was 3/4 or 80% or something like that.",

Pain control is so important in managing any medical condition long term, let alone metastatic cancer. Your overall level of health is likely to deteriorate if you're in pain and that's the last thing you need.  My response would be to find another GP who is more sympathetic and on the ball. Failing that then I would suggest asking either the GP or your onco for a referral to a pain clinic. Unfortunately, you may need to be rather assertive! Mind you I think I'd be having a total tantrum. Wishing you all the best Lynn xx",

It will diminish as it's your body adjusting to lower oestrogen levels.  George (Dreamthief) posted a really clear explanation of what's going on a few weeks back. Unfortunately I can't recall the detail but I've tagged him so he can repeat it if he's around. Thanks George. And to suzie02 So sorry to hear you're feeling so down. Deal with the sleep problem and things may well start looking up as the world always looks darker when you're not sleeping. Time for a visit to the GP. As far as the kids go, I agree with whoever said to say no. If necessary make up reasons why you can't have them. Don't let him control your life.  And as for housework, who cares? Don't put that stress on yourself.  Who's going to say you're a bad person  if you don't vacuum or the shelves are dusty? And if anyone did, you simply don't need to have them in your life. As long as the kitchen and bathroom are reasonably hygenic then say bollocks to all of it. I've been practising that wilful blindness for years and I'm getting very good at it lol. What about your kids? Why can't they help? When mine were at home, we all pitched in (hey I've hated housework for ever) and whilst they grumbled, they did do their bit, and of course learned valuable life lessons too.  Finally, please try not to obsess about dying. If you had no lymph node involvement and the onco didn't even feel the need for you to have chemo, then your cancer was caught early and there's a high likelihood that you've been cured. Of course none of us ever knows for sure but the stats are so good, there's no point in wasting your emotional energy on that particular worry.  Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

I do wonder though how so many surgeons and oncos can be oblivious to the impact this has on people. Grrr .

If so, you should get given a temporary foob (fake boob) known as a softie, before you leave hospital. Check with the BCN. On a longer term basis, you can get a silicon prosthesis. I think on the NHS in the UK but I'm in Australia so I'm not sure. (ronstar ???) Otherwise, you can continue to use the softie.  My personal preference is for knitted knockers. Knitted foobs stuffed with fibrefill, or shower scrunchy for swimming. I've made several in different colours and to my exact size to match the other side. The other bonus is that you can just pin them (with safety pins) inside a normal bra. I wear padded/preformed bras to make it easier to get and keep the right shape. If you can't knit there is a group in the UK that will send you KKs free. You may be able to have a reconstruction later, probably with an implant I'd imagine if you have blood supply issues. However, as far as I know surgeons would want to wait at least 6 months from your last treatment, especially if you have radiotherapy. Suggest you speak to your surgeon as soon as you see him/her so you can find out what might be possible. DO NOT DESPAIR Life with one boob is absolutely fine. Great even. Hugs",

They were all i could tolerate, which in itself was unusual as i'm no fruit bat and rarely eat eggies.

My back gave me grief for several months after diagnosis and surgery - I put it down to all those uncomfortable scan beds and a bit of rough handling while I was under. I did have an MRI of my chest area as I had calcifications on my spine. Turned out to be just that - calcifications. It may well be related to your surgery but as it seems to be persisting, you should contact your doctor and get a scan, even if only for your peace of mind. Now as for your husband ... My hubby was very supportive but we did have some rocky moments. He's neurotic and anxious and has had depression (still on the happy pills). Mostly he tends to overreact, which wasn't a great deal of fun. We've talked about it since in calmer moments so here's what he said was going on. Firstly, he felt left out because I was getting all the attention. Secondly, I was only interested in me. Thirdly, he's a bloke and he's supposed to fix things, but he couldn't fix this and felt really helpless. Now I think the third one is entirely understandable but the other two really pissed me off - very selfish I thought. However, I didn't say so. I too had always been the strong one and I think he was genuinely flopping around when I was no longer able to be his rock. And I know I had less tolerance for his wobbles. I was very self-absorbed, as I think everyone on chemo is, but I hadn't realised I'd reached the point where I wouldn't eg say thank you if he made me a cup of tea or say hello when he got home. So I started making more effort to be nice to him and also I gave him particular tasks to do so he wouldn't feel left out. He became my chauffeur, bedmaker and chief researcher. This all worked and the path was much smoother later on.  Try to take a dispassionate look at what's going on between you. There may be some things you can adjust that will make life better for both of you. However, don't be a martyr - you have a right to expect support from him. Happy to chat further - let me know how it goes. Best Lynn xx",

I found that after about 6 months I could see my normal hair growing at the base so I've been keeping it short (about 3 cm long) and getting the curls gradually cut off. I reckon I've got one or two more haircuts to go. Now you can see it's normal hair but there's a pale grey twist at the end. The colour has also gone back to what it was before - a mix of brown and dark grey, rather than the almost white that came through first. I used  kms shampoo and conditioner for frizzy hair (orange pack) and then leave-in conditioner mixed with a bit of evo moulding paste. That combo plasters it down enough for it to dry wavy rather than curly. ",

      "Content": "Hi Katymay. You've certainly drawn more than your share of short straws! Some of the chemotherapy drugs can be toxic to the heart - the most well-known are doxorubicin and epirubicin but there are others. If you are offered chemotherapy, think very carefully about it and make sure you have a full consultation with your cardiologist and that the drugs selected are the ones least likely to impact the heart. I have a healthy heart yet doxorubicin put me into atrial fibrillation, which in turn led to pulmonary embolisms - I came pretty close to dying! I would decline these two if I had to go through chemo again. Radiotherapy can also impact the heart, in cases where the radiation beam hits the edge of the heart. It is rare and there are various techniques to minimise the chance of the beam hitting the heart but again, I would want a full consultation with the cardiologist before agreeing to go ahead.  There may be other impacts for both chemo and radio - these are just the two I know of. Hopefully, given your history of heart disease, the MDT will bring in your cardiologist to make him/her part of the decision making process. But even if not, do insist.   Wishing you all the best               ",

Very limited range of foods though - for me it was mostly acidy foods that I enjoyed - cherry tomatoes, tomato soup, fresh orange juice, grapes and to a lesser extent pineapple. Pretty much lived on them plus scrambled eggs which tasted of nothing but didn't taste bad. One piece of advice I was given, which I mostly followed, was not to eat my favourite food as it could put me off it forever. The only ones I tried were baked beans and mashed potatoes, both of which I love, but they did taste gross so I didn't go there again. ",

Depending on the treatment offered, mainly whether the docs suggest chemo, you'll be out for a few to several months. Most people will get back to their previous levels of fitness some months after treatment finishes but it can take up to 2 years if you have chemo.  As far as reconstruction goes, I chose not to have one for long and complicated reasons but I'm quite happy as lop-sided Lizzie. It really doesn't bother me at all. Because I decided not to go for reconstruction I'm not really up with the different types. However, I do know that there's one type where they use muscle from your back. Seems to me that might not be a good idea if you're a rower. I'd suggest that you ask for an appointment with your surgeon to discuss the pros and cons of different kinds of reconstruction, including recovery periods and the likelihood of long term problems. Here's a good article from the Cancer Research UK site on different options for reconstruction.  Good luck for your surgery.",

If so, it will clear up but nerve healing is a slow process. The other thing is that during surgery (ie when you're out) they do contort your body into strange positions to make it easier to access and often people have strange pains.  Having said that, as with any persistent pain, I'd suggest you mention it to the doc next time you go. You never know, it might be something else quite unrelated to the surgery.  Best Lynn xx",

I had it drained several times in the first few months but it always came back. I also had some compression garments, both light and heavy. The heavy one did squish it but it returned if I didn't wear the wretched thing. And boy did I hate wearing that - I could hardly breathe. So now it just sits there and hasn't expanded or contracted. It doesn't hurt and isn't infected. I have spoken to my surgeon about it at my last check up. She thinks there's no point in draining it as it will refill. She also said that the pressure of the seroma prevents further leakage and will eventually enable healing. Once all the tissues are healed it should go away by itself. Waiting, waiting...  I figure that while it's not causing any problems I'll just leave it. As someone said the next step is surgery but I have also heard (from one of my chemo nurses) that they can inject an irritant, like talc, into the space and that helps the two sides adhere together.  Best of luck with it ",

So close I thought it was a reaction to the denusomab and didn't go to the doc for 3 days. Mine was pretty conventional though - starting at my sternum and spreading horizontally to my armpit (good side thank heavens). I don't think they test for shingles in your pre-chemo bloods but you could ask them if it's possible. I managed to get an occasional extra test done by persuading the nurse, who then persuaded the registrar who had to authorise it.  Hope it clears up soon for you as it must be very uncomfortable, not to mention having to cope with that on top of chemo. ",

We lived with my grandparents and uncles and aunt when I was little and finally when my parents managed to get a house, my two brothers came along. I went from that to group houses and when I left Adelaide and moved to Canberra, I moved into a hostel where I met my first husband. We moved out together. I met my second husband when I was in the throes of separating from the first but for a while lived with a friend. Then of course my current husband.  I think because of that, I love to be alone. I have a pretty good circle of friends but still value time by myself. When I retired, I immediately started doing volunteer work as I was worried about filling my days. I've made half a dozen really good friends from that.  Interestingly, I haven't made any friends through cancer treatment. The 4 other people I know who've had BC all made chemo buddies that they stay in touch with. Maybe it's because my treatment followed an irregular pattern but I didn't seem to see the same people very often at all. Not that I mind as I suspect it would be too much of a reminder of a bad time.  Bottom line is that life is what we make it. I'm not the sort of person that can sit home and mope, more likely to sit home and relish it. But we are all different. Lots of love to all Lynn xx",

Your lump should shrink in that time, meaning less invasive surgery. Great news that there's no spread to the lymph nodes - you're a bit of an advertisement for screening, I think.  Hope you're coping ok with the chemo.

      "Content": "Hi Resilent Welcome aboard. One of the fab things about this site is that there's always someone who's been or going through a similar situation to you. I find it very reassuring to know I'm not the only one.  I did post above but thought it might help to give you an update. I STILL have my seroma - that's 3 years after surgery. It just feels like a hard lump about the size of a satsuma where my boob used to be. I had it drained regularly at first but gave up on that. Now it just sits there. It's never been infected (guess I'm lucky) and doesn't really cause me any trouble. I've also tried compression with an elasticised corset thingy but I gave up on that as it squashed my other boob and also I could hardly breathe.  I do have mild lymphoedema as I had axilliary clearance on that side. The lymphoedema physio that I go to thinks part of the reason the seroma won't drain is the presence of all that fluid - it's got to go somewhere. Physio does seem to be helping a bit and I think the seroma is a little bit smaller than 12 months ago.  The good news is that I've had annual ultrasounds which just show a large pocket of fluid - nothing else and nothing wrong. I've just learned to live with it.  My advice, if you can, is to just live with it for the time being if it's not infected. The more often you have it drained, the more likely it is to get infected. However, you need to get on to the first signs of infection (any or all of red, itchy, swollen, painful) and get some antibiotics into you. My surgeon gave me a prescription for a fairly strong antibiotic to keep at home and take at the first sign.  I think it's another case of breast cancer, the gift that keeps giving. Wishing you luck with it. ",

      "Content": "Hi Mazza Welcome aboard. It can be hard to remember everything you're told by the docs - information overload. That's why it's good to receive all the pathology etc written down.  Ki 67 is a cell protein. It's presence is a way of measuring the aggressiveness of the cancer so the higher %, the more aggressive. 80% is aggressive, but that's not surprising as you are HER2+, which is an aggressive kind of breast cancer. Have you received a treatment plan? As you are HER2+ you will be offered (and probably pressured into accepting) chemo as that's the pathway to the key treatment for HER2 cancers - Herceptin and likely pertuzumab as well. If you're not offered pertuzumab, ask why not as these 2 are the gold standard now for HER2+ cancer and are getting very good results. ER 7/8 means the cancer is strongly hormone receptor positive as well, so you are likely to be offered long term (10 years) hormone therapy as well. Are you having surgery or chemo first?  They were right to tell you not to google everything - much of the info and stats on the internet are wrong or out of date and can scare you unnecessarily.  Do stick around. There are lots of lovely knowledgeable people here who will provide you with plenty of support and tips for getting through treatment. Wishing you all the best.",

I know others in the UK have had great difficulty getting fluid tablets but it might be worth mentioning it to your consultant next time you see him/her.",

I wouldn't recommend dieting during chemo as your body is messed around enough. Just try to eat some healthy things. I survived on tomato soup, fruit and hot chips. It was all I could stomach. I had minimal steroids for the second half of chemo as they'd caused me loads of health issues. No doubt that's part of the reason for not putting on weight.  And as for exercise - I barely had the energy to get up and go to the toilet, let alone anything else lol.

If the docs are suggesting chemo, they must think it's necessary/worthwhile.  Yes we all lost our hair but there are plenty of wigs, scarves, hats and bandanna options. Or, like me, you can be out and proud. It's not the end of the world.  I had my op before chemo because I was HER2+ but if possible, I think the chemo first option is good for two reasons - first you might only end up needing a lumpectomy, rather than a full mastectomy. Secondly, you can \"see\" the chemo working as the lump shrinks. The downside is that lumps don't always shrink as much as expected. As for vomiting. Not everyone gets bad nausea and vomiting - I didn't (I didn't throw up at all and only felt mildly nauseous a couple of times) - but if your mum does, there's a wide range of anti-nausea meds to help. The docs don't actually want people to throw up.  Wishing your mum all the best and sending hugs Lynn xx",

You haven't said whether you have the detailed pathology results yet, nor whether the surgeon has confirmed that s/he will want to do a mastectomy or lumpectomy, nor whether you will or will not need chemo or radio.  It is becoming more common for chemo to come before surgery, especially if there's no spread, with the goal of shrinking the lump so surgery is less invasive (possibly a wle instead of a mastectomy). Has that option been discussed with you?  As far as I know, doctors tend to discourage you from having an implant if you are to have radio as it makes the radio more complicated and there is a risk of damaging the implant and therefore needing to have it removed. It sounds like this has been made clear to you but you do need to have a good idea of whether the docs will recommend radio before you can make a decision on that basis.  I can understand that you want to minimise surgery but do bear in mind that follow up surgery is often needed anyway for various reasons.  Can I be of any further help?

And then plucking up the courage to go to the doctors. Well done you for doing something about it.  None of us on here can tell you if it's cancer - you need to have a scan and biopsy to confirm that, but remember the vast majority of breast lumps don't turn out to be cancer. When you go to the hospital you'll be given a mammogram and ultrasound. If there's anything suspicious, or even if your hospital is ultra-cautious, you'll have a biopsy. Then you'll have to wait a couple of weeks for the results. That's a scary time too. You could try over the counter pain meds like paracetamol or ibuprofen, if you can take these. Otherwise I'm afraid it's a case of grin and bear it. Often the pain is magnified by the worry. Try to keep busy - treat yourself or do one one of your favourite things. Shopping therapy works too lol. Have you talked to any of your family about this? Support from a family member is really helpful, and if possible you should get someone to go with you to the appointment. I hope it turns out to be nothing to worry about.  Big hugs",

When that happens you'll be so ready to shave it off, just to get rid of the pain.  Of course much depends on the type of chemo you're having. If it's AC or EC, hair loss is guaranteed. Some people lose less with T, and other chemo drugs generally have less of an impact. ",

I've found Arimidex to be the best of the anastrozole options, with way lighter SEs than the generics. It does get easier over time as your body gets used to the lack of oestrogen.  I have found that my body doesn't deal as well with unusual movement as it did once upon a time. Not putting that very well so here's an example: I recently joined a strength and balance exercise class, with many exercises I've not done before. I was in agony for several days afterwards, mostly in tendons and cartilage  and especially in my lower back and one hip. Same again last  week but not quite so bad. I've also found that an old (1980s) repetitive strain injury has flared up and my arm can get quite sore if I hang out on the computer for too long. I can only attribute these to the Arimidex. So, similar but not identical, problems to yours.   Don't rush to quit the Arimidex but I do agree with George that the best thing to do is to ring your BCN. Good luck with it.",

Of course, it would be more disheartening if you didn't get significant shrinkage. On the other hand, the main benefit of surgery first is that the cancer is gone and everything else is belt and braces to try to make sure it doesn't come back.  I had surgery first - chemo first wasn't offered and I didn't know enough then to ask about it.

I've retired so it didn't happen to me and I'm sure someone will be along who has been through a similar experience recently. We've had a few teachers on here in the last year so highly likely someone will have something to say.  I'm sure it won't be as bad as you think. My husband has a saying \"nothing is ever as good or as bad as you think it's going to be\".  Take it as slow and steady as you can and be prepared to be exhausted by the end of the first week, so don't plan anything but relaxing for the first weekend after starting.  I hope it goes really well for you.",

      "Content": "Hi Ruthie63 As Carolyn28 said, I do have a different view from her! The approach I've taken is that all those little percentages add up - radio, AIs, chemo and so on all reduce your risk of recurrence by a bit so I want to do anything that will reduce the risk of recurrence. This is, however, in the context that I had a \"nasty aggressive cancer\" as my onco called it. In the end it's up to each individual to decide how much risk they can bear and how much treatment they can bear. You do, however, have to be comfortable that, if it were to recur, you could live with the fact that you had refused a kind of treatment ie no 'what ifs'.  To LJB234 HER2+ breast cancer  the cancer cells make an excess of the HER2 protein - it's about 20% of breast cancers. If you are HER2+ then you would be offered Herceptin, a treatment which is directly targeted at the HER2 protein. If you're HER2- then Herceptin has no effect.  Love to all Lynn xx",

She lives in a different city. 12 months ago I was very ill in ICU and my husband was told to call the family. Mum came (although she worried more about the dog being in kennels than about me). She has very clear memories of that time but not of the times (4) I've seen her since I recovered. So this means she thinks I'm very ill and won't believe me when I tell her on the phone that I'm very healthy. Not much I can do of course except reassure her as much as possible and visit when I can. Sigh! And as for scans - the waiting time is pants. It's impossible not to worry and we all let our imaginations run riot. No way to avoid it. Just go for as many distractions as you can - friends, hobbies, exercise, shopping - they all help.

      "Content": "Hi Sacha Well done you for getting through the mastectomy. Did you have full node clearance or just the sentinel nodes removed?  I'm not sure what you mean by margins of 4 and 8. Normally docs talk in terms of a margin of x mm when someone has a WLE rather than a mastectomy, so I don't know what it could mean in your case.  Chemo is usually offered when there is significant presence of cancer in the lymph nodes. The aim is to catch any stray cancer cells that may have migrated around your body and stop them growing into secondaries. It is also offered if your cancer was HER2+, as you can't have Herceptin and pertuzumab without at least having a taxane. Chemo is also usually offered to people who had triple negative breast cancer, mainly as there are no other follow up treatments for TNBC.  No oncologist would offer chemo if they didn't think there was a benefit to the patient. However, it's up to the patient ultimately to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk for them personally. For some people the reduction in risk is small, for others it's significant. You need to make sure that your oncologist explains everything, including the benefits and risks, to you very carefully. Keep pestering until you are satisfied with the answers. Some people do decline chemo. There is a thread on here from about 6 months ago that goes into this in a fair bit of detail. This is the link. Do have a read, you'll find it interesting. Best",

A couple of positive things that might help ease your mind or at least give you ammo to ask more questions: - if you're stage IIIA that means the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes but not through the rest of your body; - I had cancer in 16/30 lymph nodes but they were all removed - you are HER2 positive. Herceptin is a very effective treatment.  Finally, I was diagnosed as stage IIIB but my onco is confident that I'll recover. Don't despair, just remember you are entitled to a clear explanation of everything.

      "Content": "Hi Bramblefarm. Welcome aboard the roller coaster. I'm so sorry to hear about your diagnosis but you'll find plenty of support here.  Whether or not you need chemo will depend on the pathology of the cancer, how advanced it is (the stage) and how aggressive it is. If yours has been diagnosed as grade 3, chances are it's an aggressive one. The docs may not be able to do final staging until after your surgery as they'll take a lymph node to check for any spread to the nodes. As far as the pathology goes if the cancer is HER2 + or triple negative then a chemo recommendation is pretty much guaranteed, unless you're too frail otherwise to be able to cope with chemo. If it's hormone positive but HER2- then chemo may not be the right treatment. There are tests to help determine that - but let's not get too far ahead. Losing your hair is traumatic for some people but you can try the cold cap. And in the end, it does grow back.  One piece of advice I was given is to take it one step at a time and focus on that. So for you at the moment it's diagnosis and getting the full information. Then the medics will develop a treatment plan for you.  Do keep in touch and feel free to ask any questions you like, or just come here for a rant if you need to.",

While you are fretting (and you will - no one can tell you not to worry cos it's a worrying situation) just remember that if it is cancer, you have already taken the first step towards getting yourself fixed up and also that breast cancer is immensely survivable. In my home town the 5 year survival rate for all breast cancers is 96% - that's virtually normal. Of course it varies by sub-type of cancer, how advanced it is when diagnosed and to some extent your location but overall it is very very survivable, so don't start planning your funeral.  I agree that random googling isn't helpful but some of us need to know and understand what's going on. I did. However, I found that if I stuck to sensible well-informed sites like this one, cancer research UK and the equivalent American ones, you can get the facts without the emotive stories.  Wishing you all the very best Lynn xx",

I can't decide whether to have the reconstruction, would you recommend it, can you offer any advice? Thank you xx Hi Ann. You might want to start a new thread with this question as people may not find it as this is 5 years old and on a different topic. I had a saved skin mastectomy and immediate reconstruction (with implant). However, I got very ill in the middle of chemo and ended up putting on about 10kg worth of fluid. Eventually that went everywhere but my reconstructed boob. So I ended up with a septated (fibrous) seroma looking like a football on my chest. I had to have it surgically removed - effectively a full mastectomy. I wish I'd had a regular full mastectomy from the outset and I don't know whether I'll ever want to have a reconstruction. I don't at the moment but it's early days.  Best of luck with whatever you decide.",

My T was stopped early because of PN. My best advice is to wear crocs, no matter how naff, as they cushion your feet.  Best ",

Please bear in mind though that 90% of breast lumps turn out not to be cancer and, even if yours is, breast cancer is very treatable especially as it looks like you caught the problem quickly.  I know it's hard that the docs and technicians won't tell you anything but the technicians aren't authorised to say much as they're the experts in the machines, not the lumps. Secondly, generally doctors don't like to say anything because imagine how you'd feel if they said it looked ok and then turned out to be cancer?  So now you have to face the weekend. Remember that no amount of worrying is going to change a single thing between now and Tuesday. I know you won't stop worrying, but don't let it take over. Do something fun with your children and husband, spoil yourself, keep busy - whatever it takes to distract you.

If it is breast cancer then early diagnosis gives the best chance of a cure. However, that won't stop you worrying until you get the results. Please do remember that 90% of breast lumps turn out not to be cancerous and even if it is, BC is very treatable.  Now, as to the worrying ... Nothing I can say will stop you worrying - it's natural and normal. We've all been there. The main thing is to try to not let the worrying take over. Keep busy, treat yourself, try a new craft, do lots of exercise, perhaps a bit of shopping therapy - whatever it takes to keep your mind active on other things. Some people set aside a time for worrying eg half an hour in the morning and for the rest of the day tell themselves to park the worrying until the next \"worry time\". It seems to work and the more you practise it, the better you get at it. Also remember that there's nothing you can do now to change the outcome.  I could give you a heap more advice but I'll stick to one piece. Please try to avoid Dr Google. He'll just scare the pants off you and so much of the information out there is out of date or inaccurate. If you absolutely can't resist doing the research, then stick to trusted sites like Macmillan and Cancer Research UK. If they don't satisfy you, let me know and I'll point you in the direction of other good reliable sites.  Please do hang around this forum and post if you wish. There are some very supportive and knowledgeable people here who will hold your hand through this. Feel free to just have a rant if you need to, or ask questions. Do let us know how you get on Thursday. Wishing you all the very best.",

But  you can't make that decision unless you know. As far as losing your hair goes, it's not that bad. I went commando the entire time - I think I wore a sunhat a couple of times and that's all.

I had a generic for a couple of months, which was significantly better than letrozole but still not great. Then my pharmacist gave me some real Arimidex as that's all they had in stock. I couldn't believe the difference it made. Hardly any SEs at all. I mentioned the difference to my onco who was skeptical but he agreed to keep prescribing Arimidex only. I think that it was on that basis that if the placebo effect is working, then that's good. I really believe there's a difference though.  Now, one year later, I have very few side effects. I occasionally have trouble sleeping and I get stiff if I sit for a long period, such as watching a movie or on a flight. However, it only takes a couple of minutes to loosen up.  There is of course also the option of exemestane, which is also an AI but has a different mechanism of action. It suits some people better. I'm avoiding it though as it's steroid-based and steroids and I do not agree. As for night sweats, I found that taking the tablet in the morning was better. I'd wake up in a pool of sweat when I was taking them at night. However, the sweats do reduce over time anyway as your body gets used to the lower oestrogen level.",

I think most people would say the waiting is the worst part as your mind naturally thinks the worst. Please keep in mind that the vast majority of breast lumps do not turn out to be cancer (I think I've heard 90% but I can't remember where from and can't verify that) but also, if it did turn out to be breast cancer, you've already taken the first step in getting treated - seeing a doctor about it. You won't stop worrying, but you can control it - keep busy, treat yourself, focus on positive things.  Some breast clinics will carefully avoid saying anything, while others will give some indication. The trouble with that is there have been people on this forum who have had the doc say it looks ok and then once the pathology is in, told they have breast cancer. Personally I think that would be worse than not being told anything in the first place.  I was sent for the standard mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy \"if indicated\". Although the radiologist didn't say anything, I knew I had BC the moment he walked in and said he was going to do a biopsy.  The only caution I would add is that for about a year or so (I can't really remember how long) before I was diagnosed, I had a strong feeling that I was facing a health train wreck. No real symptoms, just knowing I wasn't quite right - in fact I thought I'd have a heart attack as heart disease runs strongly in my family. There was never enough to actually go to a doctor about until I found the lump of course. Of course I can't say whether you have BC or any other illness, but don't dismiss those feelings. Wishing you all the very best and hoping your checks turn out fine.",

However, keep remembering that breast cancer is very treatable.  It sounds like your team hasn't yet decided whether to remove all your lymph nodes on the affected side or to give you chemo. Just make sure you're comfortable with their recommendations before agreeing to anything.  Just one bit of advice. If you are to have chemo, then ask for a portacath or, if they won't agree to that, then a PICC or Hickman line. The portacath is the best as it's under your skin so doesn't cause any problems day-to-day, but any of them will be better for you than having chemo by a cannula if your veins are already shot.  BTW the operating theatres I've been in are just like on tele. What freaked me out the first time was having to get on the operating table by myself. I don't know why - it was unexpected I suppose.  Do keep in touch and let us know how you're progressing. ",

Did the hospital give you exercises? If so, are you doing them? I'd suggest trying some gentle stretching or yoga, or even a bit of swimming, especially breast stroke. It should all settle down and it's good that you're getting your other lump checked out.  Best  Lynn xx",

For a while there, my BGL was up in the 30s and I was put directly on insulin injections. Turns out it was brought on by the steroid I was given to help with nausea - dexmethasone. It's pretty standard treatment and you get it infused prior to the chemo infusion and tablets to take home. No one mentioned anything like diabetes before I started.  When I had my second set of chemo (T) I argued with my oncologist as I didn't want to have any steroids at all. In the end we compromised and I had the minimum dose for my size (4mg) and no take home tablets. My BGL was usually around 15 the next morning (usually sits at around 6.5 or 7 with drugs of course) and took a couple of days to drop back down. I would strongly recommend a discussion with the onco about steroid use prior to starting chemo.  Loulou, if I were you I would ask the onco for a serious discussion about the risks and benefits of chemo for you personally. As someone else has already said, we were all at the risk of sepsis and these days most people are given filgastrim or pegfilgastrim (Neulasta) to bring your white blood cell count up quickly. It may be that s/he has made an assessment that the benefit you might derive from chemo is outweighed by the risks but you don't know that unless it's explained fully to you. Chemo is standard here in Australia for just about everyone who has BC (except for the earliest of early cases) but there are plenty of people in the UK who post here who haven't had chemo so I think it's not quite so standard for you. You should ask for the oncotype test to get an idea of the level of benefit chemo might give you.  One other tip. If you have to have further surgery, ask to be put early on the list. My surgeon (without being asked) scheduled me for first in the day so I only had to fast for the minimum period.

I think it was more about catching up with the chemo nurses than anything else as she got bored and went shopping lol. I still love her though.  All through I wanted to be by myself so I could process things mentally in my own time, without other people wanting to discuss and dissect everything before I was ready to. My husband dropped me off and picked me up, which was great but that's all. In fact, until I was hospitalised, I don't think my onco realised I had a hubby! As it turns out, they got on really well (both being nerdy science boys) so I'd never have got a word in edgewise if I'd had my hubby at the appointments.  Your daughter will need plenty of other support during chemo as it really knocks you around. Be ready to drive her places, get shopping, look after kids, cook food etc etc and that will be appreciated I guarantee. Best Lynn xx PS She's not being \"stubborn\". It's just that you feel the need to do things a certain way and become more assertive about saying what you want. I know I did. Best to just respect her choices and go along with it.

There are also permanent expanders which they insert and then leave permanently.  Here's a link to the Macmillan explanation of implants and here's a more detailed explanation from breastcancer.org.

I'm a \"throw everything at it\" person as I don't want to ever be in the position of saying \"I wish I had ...\". As far as I'm concerned, all those different treatments contribute percentage points to reducing the risk of recurrence. Hopefully the aggregate will be enough. This is partly because I know mine was a \"nasty, aggressive cancer\" (the words of my oncologist) so I feel a need to do everything I can.  I'm currently taking anastrozole as the AI and apart from a little stiffness after sitting for a long time eg a flight or watching a movie, I have no noticeable side effects and it doesn't interfere with my quality of life at all. I also found radiotherapy very easy to get through, with a little redness on my chest area but that's all. Chemo was a different story, with dreadful side effects but if I had a recurrence, I'd go through it all again willingly.  I understand having a phobia about medication - I did for many years and wouldn't take anything. My view has completely changed and now I am glad to have drugs that keep me alive and in good health.  Do make sure you get your oncologist to go through the risk figures with you as they're really important. For some people, taking an aromatase inhibitor can dramatically reduce the risk of recurrence. Finally, I understand that this is a really tough decision. Most importantly, you must be happy in yourself whichever way you go and prepared to accept the outcomes.  Wishing you all the best.",

I had my belly button fixed recently (after 63 years of an outie, I now have a beautiful innie). I've always healed really fast with not much scarring but this time part of the wound took ages ie a couple of months to heal over. I still have a bit of scabbing. I think it's because there's a poor blood supply in that area, especially as I have a bit of belly fat. Fortunately that part is inside my bb so there's not much to see.

It partially depends on how many lymph nodes were infected. If it's a lot then chemo is more likely to be offered. If they don't mention it, ask about the oncotype test. This tests the cancer to determine how much benefit chemo would be. There's some really good information about the test here on the breastcancercare site.",

      "Content": "Hi DL. I'm not sure what percentages you're talking about. Is it the % benefit of chemo or the % chance of surviving 5 years? On the first one, if the cancer is HER2+ then the % is irrelevant as Herceptin is only licensed to be given in conjunction with chemo so everyone gets it. If the cancer turns out to be HER2-, then it's worth asking about percentage benefit and possibly the oncotype test. Some people may only get a 3-4% advantage from chemo, which you may not consider worthwhile as there's a risk in chemo itself. BUT some people do get a significant benefit, which is why it's worth the test.  If it's the latter, then my advice is to assume you will survive and put it out of your mind. Deal with a recurrence only if it occurs.  As far as diet goes, I confess I'm not a great believer in the organic thing. The science doesn't make sense to me. Some of it is truly absurd - for example buying a jar of pasta sauce that says made with organic tomatoes: yes but think of all the preservatives and other things in the sauce. Not sure about the sugar thing either. I prefer a good, well-balanced diet incorporating plenty of fresh food, especially fruit and vegetables, with moderate exercise and limited alcohol. I am, however, a firm believer that stress is a big factor and I have tried as far as possible to de-stress my life.",

Some persist but they're not dangerous. Do keep doing the arm and shoulder exercises as they help to get the lymph moving - it has to be encouraged to find new routes to drain away.  Best  Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Thanks collies. I can more confidently answer your question now. You might want to repost in the breast group too to get more responses. I had all my lymph nodes removed at the same time as having a saved skin mastectomy with implant. The whole procedure was pretty straightforward for me - I was driving within a week and I'm confident I would have been ready to go back to work after a fortnight at most, but glad I'm retired lol. Not everyone finds it that easy though. I had very little pain - I was given some panadeine forte to take home but only used a couple of them and that was more to get to sleep than for the pain.  As for side effects, the possible immediate side effects are seroma (build up of fluid) and failure of the wound to heal. That's much rarer but it does happen. Seromas tend to go away in a few weeks and often people have them drained a couple of times and they go away. I have had a seroma for 18 months, which is very rare. It won't go but it doesn't bother me so I've stopped worrying about it. The long term side effect that's more common is lymphoedema, which I've read can affect up to 25% of people. If you get any arm swelling, it's important to jump on it quickly and get treatment - that gives you the best chance of getting it under control.  Overall, most people find axillary clearance not perfect but not too bad. Better than having cancer remaining in the nodes of course.  There is an alternative to node clearance and that's to have radiotherapy on the nodes. Some people do very well with that. There's a big trial going on at the moment called the POSNOC trial to look at the value of radiotherapy. It might be worth asking your surgeon about whether RT is a possible alternative for you, or at least participation in the trial. The other option that might be available is to have a partial node clearance. Some people just have the next layer of nodes removed and tested, leaving some behind and thus reducing the risk of lymphoedema. Of course I've no idea whether either might be suitable for you but it could be worth doing a bit of research and then discussing with your surgeon.  Hope it all goes well for you. ",

I'm afraid low blood counts are par for the course with FEC-T chemo. Chemo kills all types of fast growing cells, not just cancer cells - that's why we lose our hair, our taste goes weird and so on. Blood cells are also fast growing so get knocked out by the chemo, making the risk of infection greater. Some people are given injections of Neupogen (filgastrim) or Neulasta (pegfilgastrim) to stimulate the production of white blood cells. Has your Mum had either of these?  It's hard to say how your mum will react to the taxotere. Some people say it's easier than FEC, but others find it quite hard - I've seen people refer to it as being hit by the tax truck. If she finds it really difficult, then it is possible to switch to the weekly paclitaxel, which has less difficult side effects. I had that and to be honest found it a breeze by comparison to my earlier chemo.  Wishing you and your mum all the very best",

You make it sound like they go in through your breast and pop out on your back  somewhere near your shoulder blade. That is not so. Firstly, the intensity of the radiation beam, and thus how far it penetrates into the body, is variable. Secondly, the angles used mean that much of the radiation goes across the breast rather than directly into it. Part of the radiotherapy planning process is to work all these angles out, with the aim of missing the heart and lungs so far as is possible. As for unexplained coughing, coughing can be a side effect of letrozole. However, I would caution everyone not to immediately assume an unexplained cough is a letrozole SE. You should always get a cough checked if it persists for more than a week or two.",

      "Content": "Hi Boudicca. I had a port - they're more or less automatic here in Australia. I think everyone should be offered one, or if not that a PICC line, as chemo is very tough on your veins and there's greater risk of leakage. Do you have \"good\" veins or rubbish ones? You can tell by how easy it is for them to find a vein to take blood. If they're rubbish, that's all the more reason to opt for a port/PICC. As someone else said, in the UK it seems to vary between NHS trusts but if you're offered either I'd recommend taking it.  To me the port is the rolls-royce option as it's inserted under the skin so you can go about your life without worrying - showers, baths, exercise etc etc, and they only access it when needed for chemo or to take blood. They usually insert the port just above the breast on the good side so you'd have a small scar there, although I've also seen them placed under the breast where a scar is less obvious. Mind you, I had mine removed about 6 months ago and the scar has virtually disappeared. The PICC line is also good but does dangle outside your body so there are some restrictions such as needing to wear a waterproof sleeve when showering. Some ladies have complained about bits digging into your arm but I think that can be sorted with it being taped down adequately.  Best of luck ",

I'm taking anastrozole rather than tamoxifen but they have the same outcome, reduction of oestrogen, so have the same weight effects.  I lost 38kg (about 5 stone) during and shortly after chemo as I was very ill (the only positive side effect as far as I'm concerned). I have managed to keep it off so far but only by being very vigilant and not indulging much at all. Haven't managed to lose any more though grrr. The only way I've been able to hold my weight is by cutting down to 2 meals a day - breakfast about 10 am and then dinner about 6pm. This works for me as I'm retired and also my husband has always liked an early dinner. That used to drive me mad as I was more used to eating at 7.30 or 8 pm but is perfect now. I make sure I have a high protein breakfast and only a small amount of carbs eg 1 slice of toast or some baked beans. Dinner is meat and veg in various forms with loads of non-starchy veggies (ie no potato, few peas and so on) and no carbs. I have also stopped drinking alcohol for other reasons but I'm sure that helps. I do use butter, full fat yogurt, coconut cream and so on so it's not too Spartan. Occasionally I have fish but I don't really like it that much and I allow myself a treat once a fortnight. Treat might be hot chips, roast potatoes or cake.  It's pretty strict, although my cooking has become very creative. I'm spurred on though by having been told by my onco that fat produces oestrogen so losing weight (or at least not gaining) has an anti-cancer effect. That's enough to motivate me.

      "Content": "Ah seromas, the bane of my life! I have had a seroma since March last year, following a full mastectomy with no reconstruction. Initially it was tight and painful and I had it drained several times. Each time it came back quite quickly ie within a day or two. The last time I had it drained was just after Christmas and it seems to have stopped increasing and isn't at all painful. When I had my routine followup with my surgeon a couple of weeks ago, she said she would prefer to leave it as long as it's not causing discomfort as the pressure within the seroma stops further fluid leaking from the tissues, giving them a chance to heal properly. When healed the fluid will gradually dissipate.  So what have I learned? Firstly, while seromas can be caused by vigorous exercise, exercise doesn't seem to make much difference. I have continued with the arm/shoulder exercises as I wanted total movement in my shoulder and no cording. I have that. Secondly, I was told that compression wouldn't help. I did have fluid in my reconstructed breast before the mastectomy and had all sorts of physio, compression and massage but nothing helped.  I'm sorry but I don't have a magic solution. Mine is unusually long lived as they mostly disappear within weeks. Let's hope yours is one of those.  In summary, I'd say if you aren't in any discomfort then carry on as normal but at the first sign of any pain, redness or further swelling contact your medical team.  Best",

I think I really started to feel well at about the end of March so you were probably beaten down by your cold. I have slightly more hair than you - but I'm still sporting the Judi Dench look. In fact it was a very popular hairstyle at the radiotherapy clinic! I had several conversations, all good natured, about hair re-growth but remained satisfied that mine was above average. There was one poor woman whose hair was about 6 or 7 cm long. Trouble is she only had one hair every half cm or so. She was very upset - there's always someone worse off! I lost 33 kg (about 3 stone) during chemo cos I was fairly ill. Mind you I had plenty of reserves. When I had my radio planning, they told me not to lose any more while I was having radio so I managed to make sure I didn't with the help of donuts and hot chips lol. Have to stop eating them now! I've finished radio but my breast area is still red with a couple of sore spots. Not too bad but it doesn't yet really feel like my treatment is finished. I used the R1 and R2 creams and think that they were pretty effective. My radio-oncologist said my skin was in really good condition for someone so fair-skinned. (I never told them what I was using as I didn't want to be told not to).  Anyway, apart from the slight discomfort, I'm getting my life back to normal and enjoying every minute of it.  Radio is a pain because of the need to go every day but it doesn't hurt and those few weeks will pass quite quickly for you.

Apart from that I had shocking fatigue but little nausea. The UTIs I got later when I was on paclitaxel. It's important to remember that however vile, chemo actually works! If I had my time over I would do it all again, just perhaps be a bit more assertive about being breathless. Keep ploughing on Doglady, you'll get there. Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Paddypup. I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's diagnosis. It sounds like you're very worried about her. She's lucky to have such a supportive mother. Firstly can I just say that the only silly question is the one you don't ask. None of us know it all (and the docs don't either for that matter) so asking anything is fine. No one will judge you here.  As for inserting a marker. From what little I know about it, I think most surgeons can spot different kinds of tissue and tell cancerous tissue from normal tissue. For example, a work colleague of my hubby went for a delayed reconstruction. During the surgery, the surgeon spotted a small (3mm) cancer recurrence. He did of course remove it. She considers herself very lucky that it was found very early.  It's uncommon but not unknown for tumours to have different characteristics. In very general terms it means there are separate cancers, rather than branches of the same one. They offer all the treatments that might help get rid of any of the tumours so if one is HER2+ and one is HER2- then Herceptin will be offered. Similarly, if one is hormone positive then hormone treatment is likely to be offered.",

      "Content": "Hi Kirsteen78 Sounds like you're having a bit of a hard time there! I agree that it looks like you're being drip fed information, which is hard to handle. Adjuvant therapy just means therapy (mostly chemo) after surgery, as opposed to neo-adjuvant therapy, which is chemo prior to surgery. The majority of people have their surgery first so have adjuvant therapy, so it's not clear what you're being asked to participate in.  I hope I'm not telling you how to suck eggs but I thought I'd lay out the basics so you can think about what to ask.  Firstly, the pathology. The key points are whether your cancer was oestrogen and/or progesterone positive or negative and whether it was HER2 positive or negative. If it was HER2 positive then you will definitely need to have chemo as the HER2 targeted drugs (Herceptin and Pertuzumab) are only given in combination with traditional chemo. If you are negative for all three, most likely you will have chemo as that's the only real treatment available for triple negative BC. Not everybody that is hormone positive has chemo - the doctors look at the expected benefit to you, other aspects of the cancer and the level of node involvement. Often you will be offered what's called the oncotype test which makes an assessment of the chances of cancer recurring. Obviously I can't say which way your doctors are likely to go, although node involvement makes chemo more likely.  Secondly, node involvement. It would be unusual to leave nodes if there are strong signs of spread so it's not clear what's going on. Perhaps they intend to offer you further surgery to remove more or all of your lymph nodes or maybe there were only  a few stray cancer cells, in which case they may offer radiotherapy in the axilla (armpit) area. I'm just speculating really.  You are also likely to be offered radiotherapy of the breast area and possibly the axilla and the supra-clavicular fossa (near the collar bone). Radio is an effective way of killing off stray cancer cells in the area around your breast and seems to be offered to the majority of people with anything more than the earliest stage BC. Most people also have a CT scan of their head to pelvis area to check for spread and to make sure there's nothing undiagnosed that might affect your treatment. A lot of people are given a bone scan too. These scans don't mean that the docs think that the cancer has spread, more that they want to confirm that it hasn't.  As you can see there's quite a lot you need to clarify before your treatment.  I'd suggest you compile a list of all the questions to ask your onco/surgeon (whoever you see next) and make it clear that you want the full story. One thing I've learned through this whole BC experience is that you need to be an assertive patient and make sure you're satisfied and comfortable with everything that's happening to you. You might also want to think about taking someone with you to the appointment to make notes or recording the conversation (with permission of course). I guarantee you won't remember everything you're told without some kind of aide memoire. This is a worrying and uncertain time for you no doubt but as things become clearer and your treatment plan is organised, it will settle and soon you'll be on the way to the other end. Always remember BC is very treatable. Best wishes for your journey and do keep coming back to this forum. People here are really kind, supportive and knowledgeable.  Lynn xx",

Seems to me that you have a great opportunity to go in on the front foot and control the conversation. Be assertive. Perhaps start out by saying 'my current issues are ...\" . As we tell the newbies, make some notes, ask the questions, and so on.  I haven't had to change hospitals but my medical oncologist, surgeon and radio oncologist do operate out of different practices. They do seem to want to do their own examinations and come to their own conclusions on everything. They were all trying to see me every 3 months until I jacked up and got the surgeon and the medical onco to agree to alternate 3 month appointments. This is a roundabout way of saying they might want to re-scan you. I think it's perfectly reasonably for you to say no, even if only on the basis of additional unnecessary radiation.  Hope it all goes well and you can form a good relationship with this team.  Best Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Wow what an interesting thread - so many sub-threads going on.  On whether or not to have chemo ... As Carolyn28 said, I do have a different view to her. I will do anything to reduce the risk of cancer coming back and I'll take all those little percentage gains - they all add up in the end. As a result, I've had surgery, chemo, radio, herceptin, denusomab and anastrozole so far and will take anything further that the oncologist offers. I should also say that chemo knocked me around pretty badly - I got quite ill - but given my time over, I'd do exactly the same again. On husbands ... my husband has been great but I know how hard it has been for him. He has said things like \"can you imagine how hard it is watching the one you love suffer so much and know there's nothing you can do\" and \"I feel completely useless and on the outside\". I'm a pretty independent person and throughout have kept trying to do as much as I can but when he said these things, it made me re-think. People on the outside do feel useless and do genuinely want to help/ease the burden for you. I decided to make sure that I did ask for help and make him feel involved as much as I could. There were plenty of things I struggled with, mostly involving strength tasks so I got him changing the sheets, taking out the rubbish, vacuuming etc, as well as driving me to chemo and other appointments where parking was crap. Also, as he's a bit of a science nerd, I put him in charge of research - he loves reading all those scientific papers about some new drug or the benefits of weekly vs 3 weekly taxanes. Each to his own lol. The same would apply to adult or almost-adult children - let them in and let them help. It will make them feel better in themselves, make life easier for you and hopefully bring you all closer. Wishing everybody the very best Lynn xx",

Rest when you need to, exercise as much as you can as it really does help and drink at least 2 litres of water every day. I actually did 3 litres in the 24 hours following treatment to flush it round and out.  I didn't have much trouble with nausea but I did find it was better if I had something in my stomach.

My view is throw everything you can at the nasty beast to maximise your chances of it not coming back. 8% uplift is pretty good I think. Also ask yourself how you would feel if you don't have chemo and it comes back.  I had chemo and had a terrible time (check my profile if you're interested) but despite that, I'd make the same decision again. But really it's an individual thing, even though the decision may be difficult. Some people do sail through and don't have a hard time like I did.  Best of luck with your decision.",

Scans and mets - my onco told me that mets are never symptom-free (pain, cough, breathless, headache, tummy ache depending on where they pop up) so the best way of detecting mets is the patient themselves. His view is that scans are pointless cos they are taken at a single point in time and don't deal with the year or so in between. For my annual review, however, I did get both a mammo on my good breast and an ultrasound of that and the chest area where I had a mastectomy - these to check for local recurrence. All this means that we all need to be vigilant about any changes in our bodies and get it checked asap.  As for the aching. I have it too but I am on AIs. However, both my onco and my GP have told me that it can take up to a year from finishing chemo to completely recover. So early days yet for you. Best of luck Lynn xx",

Actually I'll go for anything that makes the prognosis better.  I have found that oncologists here are just as competent as anywhere else - it's a world wide practice and they all seem to be in touch with colleagues overseas and also read the scholarly journals.  If your s-i-l feels the need for a second opinion, I think you don't need to look beyond Canada at this stage. Her cancer isn't so rare that it's only handled in the top 3 places in the world.

I had 50 Gray in 25 sessions (5 weeks), which is standard here in Australia.  I used the R1 and R2 creams, which were absolutely fantastic for me. My skin reddened (like a mild sunburn) and I ended up with one small spot (about the size of a pound coin) where the skin broke down. However, I was given silicon dressings (Mepilex) which stick without any adhesive and peel off without any sticking or pain. Kept that area covered for a few days and it was fine. The redness disappeared about a week after I'd finished.  The only advice I'd give is to wear a bra as little as you possibly can to avoid rubbing and wear old cotton Tshirts or shirts next to your skin. The more you can avoid any irritation, the better your skin will be.  I thought it was going to be a real pain having to go every day for so long (ruin my social life and all that) but it went very quickly. I did find I was tired afterwards but a nanna nap sorted that out. Best of luck Lynn xx",

They didn't arrive till a week after I'd started radio by which time my skin was already reddening. There was an immediate improvement once I started the R1/R2.  I used to apply the R1 cream in the change room after treatment and then go home without a bra (loose tops all round lol) ie I didn't sit around for 20 mins waiting. I don't think it's necessary. I'd then put the R2 on once I got home, then again at night.  Karen is absolutely right - you need to have your treatment with absolutely nothing on your skin. This is particularly to ensure that there are no metals like zinc or aluminium hanging around. We were recommended to use Dove ultra sensitive soap - horrid greasy stuff but it worked. Make sure you have no deodorant or perfume either. A friend of mine, who couldn't stand that, used to spray perfume on her top; I didn't bother.  Best of luck Lynn xx",

Anyway I survived on scrambled egg, canned tomato soup, grapes, cherry tomatoes and fresh orange juice. The last three tasted really good, better than they do normally, and the other two I ate because I had to eat something. My taste normalised pretty quickly after chemo. The only problem was that it took me a while to get used to chili again so hubby was always moaning about mild curries. Solved that problem by making some chili pickle for him. He's now addicted lol.

Nevertheless I didn't feel ill enough to actually go to a doctor and only went when I found the lump. Ironically, my heart is strong, as my cardiologist says.  Also, despite the rigours of treatment and what happened to me, once I'd recovered and since I feel much healthier than I did before I was diagnosed. ",

      "Content": "Hi 4paws So sorry to hear you're suffering with docetaxel (and it will be that as H is relatively easy on you). I had the weekly paclitaxel and had similar side effects, but possibly at a lower level. I wasn't nauseous either but I'm not one to throw up ever. Most food tasted foul. I lived on cherry tomatoes, grapes, fresh orange juice, tinned tomato soup and scrambled egg. Couldn't take anything else. Even water was tough so I used to squeeze lemon or orange into it and eventually found weak Ribena was ok.  I was given a bicarb mouthwash by my chemo unit. It worked really well on the bad mouth taste. There are plenty of recipes on the Internet - 1/2 tsp bicarb in a cup of water is the simplest. I found that using the mouth wash just before I ate really helped. You might also find an anti-histamine helps with the pains - suggest you discuss that with your oncologist. I used clarytine as that was given to me as a premed before each dose. As for Herceptin, the main side effect I had was the drippy nose, where suddenly water just pours out of your nose with no real warning. I used more tissues in that 12 months than in the rest of my life! Stay strong - you're nearly at the end. Best",

      "Content": "Yes it can be upsetting Karin. Trouble is that as a society we don't deal well with critical illnesses like cancer and people often don't know what to say or how to react. This means that instead of saying 'that's crap, but how can I help' or something like that, they pussyfoot around or say inappropriate things. Even worse are those who you though were your friends who conveniently disappear. On the plus side, you will find that the vast majority of people are incredibly helpful and supportive and that some people who you thought were just acquaintances turn out to be real friends. So don't dismiss people too early for saying the wrong thing. On the other hand, if people are messing with your head then drop them like hot potatoes - you need to be able to focus on getting well, not on dealing with other people's issues. Don't worry it will become very clear who the good people are! I was very blessed with half a dozen incredibly supportive friends who helped both me and my husband physically and mentally. Wishing you all the very best. Make sure you keep coming back to this forum - it's invaluable. Hugs  Lynn xx",

      "Content": "I had a portacath fitted, which I believe is the rolls royce but I think you should grab anything that's on offer to avoid cannulas in your veins. I've seen enough poor people with vein problems from chemo to now believe that everyone should be offered a PICC, Hickman or portacath. I was given a portacath because here in Australia we still get herceptin by infusion (not the case in the UK I think) so I'm committed to infusions for a year! The benefits of a portacath ahead of the others are that it's completely under the skin and it only needs to be flushed every 6 - 8 weeks so flushing only becomes an issue if you decide to keep it after chemo is finished. The downside is that there's quite a sharp pain each time they need to access the port - but it's momentary. Anyway, if a PICC line is what's on offer for you, you should take it to save your veins. Best wishes for your treatment Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Karakeys. I understand where you're at. I had more scans and tests in the first month than I've had in my entire life. It's a bewildering new world with info being pushed at you, terms you don't understand and umpteen doctors, nurses, technicians. I've never really been ill before getting BC so it was very hard at first. Things do become clearer once you have the full details of your diagnosis and have a treatment plan. You do settle into a routine - mostly being a professional patient! A lot of people take someone with them to their appointments, for emotional support and also to listen, as you never remember everything you're told. I preferred not to, but I did take a notebook and wrote everything down so I could think about it later, or look up terms I didn't understand. I also made a note of questions as they came to me, which I could then ask the oncologist when I saw him. Sure as anything, you'll forget your questions during your actual appointments. If you're having surgery first, is there someone who you could stay with, or could stay with you? They won't let you out of hospital early if you're going home to an empty house but if there's someone there you'll be in overnight only, unless there are problems of course. If you have stage 1 - 3 cancer, then the surgery is to get rid of it. Chemo and radio and other treatments are to stop it coming back.  Chemo justifiably has a bad rep. It's not nice but you will get through it. Not everyone gets terrible side effects and the chemo unit will have loads of drugs etc to help with them. People on here will have plenty of advice and assistance too.   Anyway welcome to the club. Sorry you're here but we are a friendly bunch so don't be shy in asking questions or just ranting or having a moan. We all understand and have been there one way or another. Big hugs Lynn xx",

I'm not sure of the consequences for men but I know for women it often results in stiff and painful joints, as well as menopausal symptoms. I had a bit of a look and the main side effects for men seem to be headaches, nausea, hot flushes, skin rash, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and weight and mood changes. Sounds dreadful doesn't it but I've not found mine that bad and many people manage to persevere with it. There seems to be quite a bit of info on US sites and it's pretty easy to tell which are the reliable ones - breastcare.org and cancercare.org are both fine. One tip: despite what doctors say, many of us have found that your body reacts differently to different brands of drugs. It's not the active ingredient but the fillers that are used. So if your husband finds it heavy going then it's worth trying a different brand for a couple of months to see if it makes any difference. It does for me! And finally, I hope they've taken him off the Dutasteride. Has he asked about the consequences for his prostate with tamoxifen? Hope you're going to celebrate! Best",

Eventually that all went, except in my new boob, so I was left with a football on my chest. I had physio, lymph massage and compression but nothing worked. The fluid in my boob septated ie grew fibres in it, so it was a sponge rather than a balloon, and these compressed the implant. At that point I had to have the implant removed. My surgeon offered me a new one but by then (6 months later) I was so sick of the whole business that I opted for a mastectomy. I don't regret it one little bit. It healed really fast - within 2 weeks there was a full scar and no scab. I do have a seroma which won't go away but that makes me think I've made the right decision. Yes I only have one boob but honestly it doesn't bother me. I use knitted knockers and they suit me perfectly. I doubt I'll bother with a reconstruction as I don't want to risk more fluid problems but my surgeon has said she'll do it if I change my mind. The best thing is no more chopping me up, waiting to heal etc etc Hope it all works out for you",

Awful while I was going through it but now I'm quite glad as i was at high risk of stroke.  You probably feel really unfit and quite terrible. I know I did when I first got out of hospital - couldn't walk more than 20 metres and was pretty breathless, as well as bald and fatigued from chemo. That was in October 2015. Now I'm as fit as a flea, have lost weight, doing enough exercise, off the grog, and completed chemo and radio. I had to work at it but I can assure you there is a road back to good health. Also, I have had a portacath right from the start. Wonderful! It hasn't been a moment's trouble and I have decided to keep it till I finish Herceptin in September.

I too found it hard to keep track of how much I'd drunk so I got 3 x 750 ml bottles that I filled every morning and gradually worked my way through them. Don't forget other liquids also count, except for coffee and tea.  As for BP, my chemo nurses only looked at the systolic and didn't blink an eyelid until it was over 150. After that they'd get the registrar to check you, not that it happened to me (one of the few problems I didn't have). They said up to 150 is nothing to worry about. It's mostly fear but add in a touch of white coat syndrome and the effect of prior chemo doses.  Best Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi LL Don't even think about giving up your job!!!!!!!! There is a long way to go before that is even on the horizon. You should talk to the oncologist and get him to refer you for proper pain management. Seems to me the GP is only recommending everyday drugs,none of the good stuff. But you don't have an everyday problem. I'd also suggest that you have a really critical look at how you do your job: how you lift the child, how much you bend over, do you go up and down stairs a lot, standing or sitting and so on. Look for efficiencies and energy saving ways of doing things. A few new habits may help a lot. Finally, on the question of poo ... my bowels have never really recovered from chemo - I have the same problem as you. I can fill myself  with lentils veggies hot curry and everything else that's supposed to work = nothing. Particularly irritating is that my husband is a poo machine. I've found the best thing is a product  called coloxyl with senna. A district nurse put me on to it. After day 2 of no poo, I take 2 at night and am usually right the next day.  If not,  I take 2 again at night and am definitely ok the following day. I don't know if it's available in the UK but the active ingredient is docusate sodium. I've always had a tendency this way though - first time I went to India I was constipated for 8 days -I think I was so scared of getting the runs, my bowels locked up lol.  I  hope you've had a lovely day and that there are many more to come.  Big birthday hugs  Lynn xxxxxxx",

It might get tough at times but in the end you'll get there.  I can't help on the work front as I'm lucky enough to be retired. Carolyn28 may be able to help on that as she's self-employed too. As far as your dog is concerned you should try to keep her with you as much as possible as I'm sure you'll want the companionship. Nothing like a pet to keep you sane and happy.  How much difficulty you have with walking her mostly will depend on how big a dog she is. You should be able to manage a short walk with a small dog even if you have to have chemo but if she's a bigger dog needing lots of exercise you might need a bit of help. Do you have dog-walking buddies - my mum's buddies had a roster when she broke her hip. Alternatively is there a teenager nearby that would walk her regularly for a small fee? If everything goes well, you'll only be in hospital for one or possibly two nights when you have your surgery and gentle exercise is very good for you during chemo. Don't be afraid to let people help you. I felt blessed, especially during chemo, with how some of my friends rallied round my husband and I. It has definitely drawn me closer to several people and I'm very thankful for that. If the tables were turned, wouldn't you want to help them? Happy to try to answer any questions you have.

      "Content": "Hi @pussycatgirl It's a shame they didn't get it all first time round, but it's not the end of the world! First up I had a skin saving mastectomy and reconstruction with implant. It was a very pretty boob but a few months later I got really ill and was carrying a lot of fluid, including in my new breast. Eventually all the fluid went, except in the breast. I had physio, massage, binding, drainage but nothing worked so I had to have surgery. By then I was so sick of having a football on my chest that I decided to go for a mastectomy and no reconstruction.  Now, 18 months later, I have absolutely no regrets. Being lopsided Lizzie doesn't worry me at all and I don't feel any less feminine. In fact, in a strange way I feel more feminine - you can take my boob, you can take my hair but I'm still a woman! My husband doesn't care - he's just glad I'm healthy.  I have always used knitted knockers as they're soft and comfortable and, if you pin them in your bra with a couple of safety pins, you can wear regular bras. I use slightly padded bras that are preformed (actually my old bras with the underwire removed). The padding helps with the shape - I can't tell any difference once I have a top on. I just have to be a little careful with low cut tops. I also have a knitted knocker filled with shower scrunchie material for swimming. I just pin it in my bathers. I'm not a bikini person but others have said that balconette bikinis are fine.  I have even been known to go down to the shops without a bra/knocker, provided I'm wearing a loose sweatshirt. I'm more embarrassed about the droopy boob on the other side than I am about the flat side.  So to sum up. I've completely adapted to having one boob. My surgeon offers me a reconstruction every time I see her but I won't have one. I don't need to and I've had so many fluid problems that I don't want to expose myself to more.  I know it's not easy but as everything, it's about the attitude you go into it with. Wishing you the best of luck with it.",

It's American so the conversions are  4 ply yarn (what the Americans call Sport), No 10 or 3.25mm needles  Double knit/8 ply yarn, no 8 or 4 mm needles (the instructions for this are in brackets).  I find using 4 ply acrylic gives the best result. I have used cotton but it's heavy and takes ages to dry. It works perfectly well if you start with 3 stitches on each needle and just sew up the tiny hole. It's also much less fiddly. That probably doesn't make much sense to you but it will to a knitter lol.  Best",

      "Content": "Hi Rachmeister Welcome aboard, but sorry you had to find yourself here.  The post surgery bras are ugly very elasticated things that your grandma would've worn but they do work to hold everything in place after an implant reconstruction. I totally agree about the front opening tops as it's quite hard to manoeuvre your arms initially. I wore hubby's holiday shirts. Not fashion forward but they worked. As for the drain, I was given a drain bag but I found it was a lot easier to pin the drain to my shirt with a safety pin as I didn't then forget it and leave it behind when I got up.  The main thing I'd add to the list is facial moisturiser as your skin can get very dry. I also like to take my own soap/cleanser as the soap offered is usually horrid. What about underpants? If you're wearing a gown, it's nice to be covered up.  Also, make sure you do the arm exercises they'll give you very religiously. You need to get your shoulder working again, especially if you're going to have radiotherapy.  Interesting to hear you have AF. I developed it and pulmonary embolisms during chemo. Have you been offered a cardioversion yet? It revolutionised my life - I felt instantly better, even walking out of the hospital was easier. Interesting that you've been told not to use nsaids. I can't but that's because I now have to take warfarin forever. Are you on blood thinners? Also, make sure you follow instructions exactly re wound care. Fortunately my surgeon used the stick on dressing that stays there until you peel it off, so my whole wound area was sealed for the first 11 days ie until I peeled it off. That meant I was able to shower right from the beginning. If you don't get one of those, there should be all sorts of instructions re not getting the wound area wet, changing the dressing and so on.  Hope it all goes well for you. Big hugs in anticipation.",

      "Content": "Thanks Rachmeister It's really interesting how treatment varies around the world. I'm in Australia so I've had the advantage of being able to switch to private medicine quite easily. I seem to have been given the traditional medicines - digoxin and sotalol for the heart and warfarin as the blood thinner. I'm still on the heart meds as I have a thyroid problem too. Once that's fixed they'll take me off the heart meds apparently, although I don't mind taking them. Fixing the thyroid means drinking something radioactive I'm not rushing. They say that warfarin is outdated because you have to have your INR checked every month or so. I don't mind that and I quite like the fact that its effects can be easily reversed with a shot of Vitamin K. That means if I'm ever in a car accident or similar, something can be done to stop me bleeding out.  Sorry to hear the cardioversion hasn't worked for you. My cardiologist told me that they can do it 5 or 6 times but I'm so glad it worked first time. It was January last year so I'm pretty confident it's settled down now, although permanent is a big call. The crosses we bear ...",

For me, the soreness and burning lasted almost exactly 2 weeks, although I've heard others say it lasted a week or two longer.  Be very careful how you wash - just pat, not rub, and only use aqueous cream or a very mild soap like Dove sensitive - to give yourself the best chance of healing quickly. I had just one sore spot but oh boy was it painful. My radio unit gave me Mepilex silicon dressings which were magical. They are peel on, peel off with no adhesive and just protect the sore area. My sore spot healed in a few days with them.  I was using R2 over the area but avoided the sore spot. I've never heard of flamazime cream but I wouldn't recommend using any creams without checking with your radio unit first. Best",

      "Content": "Hi AngieD Welcome aboard the roller coaster. I'm so sorry to hear that your husband has joined the club that no one wants to be a member of. However, let me reassure you that breast cancer is very treatable.  I think the thing I learned most of all from my BC treatment is that you have to be an assertive patient. You need to ask the questions and make sure you're satisfied with the answers. In your husband's case, the issue of drug interaction will be very important as he takes important regular medication. He'll need to keep at it until he's satisfied with the answers - the days of doing as the doctor tells you are long gone.  Turning first to chemo. Chemo isn't always necessary for ER+ BC. It can be treated effectively with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. However, I don't know exactly how the oncologists decide as the oncotype test isn't used in every case as far as I know. He may wish to ask what percentage benefit is expected from chemo and then weigh that against the risks of chemo. I think it would be wise to ask for an oncotype test if it's not mentioned by the doc, or at least ask why s/he isn't proposing it. You both also need to bear in mind that while some people have nasty side effects from chemo, others sail through, with many people in this forum having been able to work some or all of the time. There are also very good drugs these days to help with the side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.  As far as radiotherapy is concerned, the vast majority of people find that much easier than chemo. Again, I don't know how radio might affect someone with Parkinson's so that needs to be raised with the oncologist. As someone has already said, make sure to write down all your questions as it's very easy to forget them once you're in the consulting room. Wishing you both the very best.",

I by no means have all the answers but hopefully this will help you.  Anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane are pretty much the same in effect ie they strip oestrogen from your body. Side effects can happen with each of them and it varies immensely from person to person. I expect you've seen the various threads about different brands having different effects so it pays to change brands before giving up or asking for a different AI. Zoledronic acid, or an alternative like denusomab, are often prescribed with an AI as the AI can strip calcium from your bones. They do also help to prevent bone mets. You should also be prescribed a calcium supplement. As for the teeth thing. A rare side effect of ZA etc is osteochronosis of the jaw, where basically the jaw starts to disintegrate. It's usually started with a tooth problem so it's best to ensure your teeth are in good nick before you start.  I'm not a believer in giving up dairy or anything else for that matter. I'm more for eating a balanced sensible diet and minimising junk food. My onco gently suggested that I should try to lose some weight, as oestrogen is produced in fat cells in post-menopausal women, so the less fat the better. Can't say I'm excelling in that department.  Best",

They said they only refer you to the dr if the systolic goes above 160.  We do have a BP machine at home (hubby is a hypochondriac lol) and it always reverted to normal within 24 hours.

Set it up, put it on your arm and then sit quietly for 5 mins before taking it. That's how you get reliable readings, as your BP will fluctuate quite a lot during the day. Record the readings so you can track any pattern and then you can work out what might be causing changes eg anticipation of doctor's visit, what you had for dinner, how you slept and so on. I also recorded pulse rate but I was having trouble with atrial fibrillation so heart rate was a big issue for me. Thankfully that's fixed now by my hero cardiologist lol. I have occasionally taken it when either I felt lightheaded (possibly low BP) or stressed (higher) just to see what happened. I never got consistent readings, although the fluctuations weren't wild.

I have a portacath and haven't had a moment's problem with it.  Being HER2+ isn't such a bad thing as Herceptin is pretty effective and there are other drugs newer to the market or under trial that are specifically targetted at HER2+.

When I was ready to start the T part of my chemo, I asked my oncologist if I could have it without any steroids at all. He declined because of the potential allergic reaction but he cut them right back - I just had 4mg by infusion immediately prior to each T treatment, no pills beforehand or afterwards. Mind you my blood glucose level still shot up and stayed that way for about 48 hours, so the wretched dex was still having an effect. I think by the time you've had a couple of T and H treatments, they know whether you're going to have an allergic reaction at all. I ended up having 9/12 paclitaxel as I got peripheral neuropathy. That didn't stop me having a full 1 year course of Herceptin. I also remember someone else on here only having one T treatment I think but still having H.  Bottom line is that it's probably best if you can manage the final treatment Jo but if you really think you can't then you need to discuss the way forward with your onco.

For me, the soreness and burning lasted almost exactly 2 weeks, although I've heard others say it lasted a week or two longer.  Be very careful how you wash - just pat, not rub, and only use aqueous cream or a very mild soap like Dove sensitive - to give yourself the best chance of healing quickly. I had just one sore spot but oh boy was it painful. My radio unit gave me Mepilex silicon dressings which were magical. They are peel on, peel off with no adhesive and just protect the sore area. My sore spot healed in a few days with them.  I was using R2 over the area but avoided the sore spot. I've never heard of flamazime cream but I wouldn't recommend using any creams without checking with your radio unit first. Best",

Of course, you've been doing yours during the day so it will fluctuate depending on what you've been doing and eating, that's why the first one in the morning is the most important. I had mine taken in Bali a couple of months back and it was 115/75. The doctor and nurse (both Indonesian of course) were really worried that it was too high. I managed to calm them down by insisting that was a very good BP for a fat white Australian! Indonesians are generally much shorter and wirier than westerners so I guess their normal is much lower because of that. Just shows how variable it all is. Good luck with it. Lynn xx",

I'll just give a few suggestions of practical things you can do to help, in no particular order. You don't say whether you have siblings but if you do, and they're younger than you, take some responsibility for them. It will be especially important for them to have someone to talk to. Make some freezer meals for when you're busy studying and your mum doesn't feel like cooking. Do the shopping. Help with housework.  Make sure you both have some treats - even if it's only something like a coffee out, or an ice cream.  Shave her head for her if she has to have chemo. Arrange to be home for the 24 hours after she has surgery (they mostly let you out of hospital earlier if there's someone going to be at home). When you go to appointments with her, take notes as neither of you will remember everything. It's also helpful to write down questions for the doctors when you think of them, as you often forget during the appointment. But don't give up your life. I'm sure this is the last thing your mum would want. Just a few adjustments ... Wishing you and your mum all the very best. Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Forza Welcome aboard the roller coaster. I'm so sorry to hear about your father. A cancer diagnosis is always shocking and upsetting but I suspect that a diagnosis of breast cancer is particularly tough for men. We have a few male contributors here who might be able to offer some useful support to you and your father. I'm tagging Buddha7 as he's been treated relatively recently. Puzzler is correct. The main treatment for breast cancer is surgery to remove the cancer and often the lymph nodes under the arm. Up to stage 3, that means the cancer is gone. Chemo and radio are extra treatments to try to make sure it doesn't come back.  You're probably aware that there are several forms of breast cancer. For triple negative (negative for receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2) breast cancer, there are no additional treatments at this stage, although I believe they're close.  It will be important for your father to have regular checkups and also to self-monitor ie feeling for any changes or new lumps and he should check both sides regularly, as well as his armpits.  Always remember that breast cancer is very treatable and over 90% of people survive more than 5 years. So once his radio is finished, then your father should get out there and live his life. Walking out of the hospital door for the last time can be scary and many people feel sort of abandoned and a bit lost without the regular schedule of scans, treatments and doctors' visits. Tell him to give himself time, and as someone put it a week or so ago, let life come to him. He'll still feel below par for some months but will gradually get back to normal, or at least a new normal. Don't expect him to be completely fit immediately. Do stay on board and feel free to ask any further questions you have. There are plenty of knowledgeable people around here.  Wishing you and your family all the best",

Well, in the 3 days he waited for the results he was diabetic, had prostate cancer and cirrhosis of the liver, his kidneys were failing, and he was about to have a heart attack - quite unbearable with the foul mood he was in.

There's a bit about ovarian suppression (which is what Zoladex does) and tamoxifen in the NICE guidelines (from Page 54 - there's a link below my signature) but I read it twice and I still can't work out why ovarian suppression is recommended in some cases and not others. The only distinguishing feature seems to be whether or not you refused chemo, but that doesn't really make sense to me.  Have a read anyway and maybe someone will be along soon who knows more about it than I do.  Sorry I couldn't be more help.",

It always feels better once you have a plan!  Chemo will be tough but as everyone says it's \"do-able\". Get prepared (see the links at the beginning of the chemo club thread), be kind to yourself and take it one day at a time. It's good that you'll be off work as working is tough when you have chemo brain and fatigue. I guess that working in a school would expose you to plenty of infection.  Try and get your teeth checked before you start chemo. The teeth/gum area is where you're most susceptible to infection so best if it's in good working order beforehand. You should also think about getting a flu shot if this coming winter's shot is available.  Wishing you all the very best Lynn xx",

Once you get a treatment plan, somehow everything settles down and, while it's not easy, you just keep pushing on till you finish. I presume the CT scan you had is the normal check to make sure the cancer hasn't spread. It's not that the docs think it has, just that they need to check. The vast majority of cases show no spread but if you're unlucky and it has, then at least you know and there are plenty of treatment options available. Doesn't make the waiting easier though! As for not getting lumps checked. I had a couple of lumps about 15 years ago and never got them looked at. When I found my latest lump (in May 2015), I was pretty sure it was cancer and went to the doc immediately. I was right and had a diagnosis that week. I don't know why I behaved differently this time. Older maybe ?? Do keep looking in on this forum. There's a great bunch of people here with a wealth of knowledge and experience and sympathetic ears to help you through this journey. Best Lynn xx",

I know it seems that the price of new drugs is a serious ripoff but think of the billions they invest in research. That can only be recouped from the few that are successful. If not for that research, ground breaking drugs like Herceptin would never have been developed. I personally think the real problem is governments that won't pay for new drugs because of the cost to the budget. I get why but it seems desperately unfair that treatment is available but not available to ordinary folks. Not just the UK - it's the same here in Australia. I have to pay full price for 6 monthly denusomab injections and a friend spent tens of thousands of dollars on a drug for his prostate cancer. What about those who can't afford it?

It eventually went from everywhere except my affected breast, which is now like a football on my chest. Docs kept telling me it would go but it didn't. I thought I had a seroma plus some lymphoedema. Turns out I was right but in the intervening period the seroma has septated (ie grown fibrous). Now my only option is a full mastectomy with removal of implant. I'm going ahead cos that'll be better than the current football. However, I'm told the lymphoedema may return. Moral of the story - don't take no for an answer. If you have any swelling that the docs or nurses try to pass of as post-operative or temporary for other reasons, just keep on at them!  On the positive side, I have been religious about the arm exercises and have no sign of lymphoedema in my arm.

She had a few chats with them and then went shopping lol. Best of luck with your appointment today. Lynn xx",

You probably don't think so right now but there are some positives - hormone positive is better than hormone negative as they'll give you either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) depending on whether you are pre or post menopause; you don't have to have chemo = big bonus; and it's still early stage which means you can be successfully treated and it may never come back.  I can understand you just wanting it out. I did. The reality is though that a few weeks makes little difference so don't panic.  You'll find plenty of support here so just ask away if you have questions or feel free to rant without judgement.  How old are your children? I'm sure it'll be tough for them whatever their age but if they're a bit older, then make sure you keep them involved in the process.  Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

I put on 2kg of fluid each week and my blood glucose level goes up to 25 or so from about 8 but it only takes a couple of days to normalise. I can put up with that.

I know the waiting is very scary - we've all been there and I don't think one person would say they weren't worried. However, a recall isn't a diagnosis of breast cancer. It may be as simple as them not getting good pictures, or there may be one area that they think needs more detail, or there may be a lump, which might or might not turn out to be breast cancer. Remember 90% of breast lumps are not cancer. Even if there is a lump that does turn out to be cancerous, breast cancer is very treatable and as you've had recent clear mammos, they will have caught anything relatively early. Nothing I can say will stop you worrying, but do try not to let the worry take over. Keep busy, try new things, perhaps a little shopping therapy and actively tell yourself to stop worrying for the time being. You can't change anything right now! Finally, try as best you can to stay away from Dr Google. So much of the information is wrong or out of date and you'll frighten the pants off yourself. If you must, then stick to reliable sites like Macmillan or Cancer Research UK. Also anything that has .gov in the URL is likely to be ok.  Wishing you all the very best",

I had \"calcifications\" on my spine that some random radiologist in my local public hospital thought were bone mets (the radiology dept doesn't have a great rep) when I was an in-patient last year. Worried my hubby stupid but no one thought to mention it to me as they all thought I was too ill to cope! Anyway, it had been picked up when I was first diagnosed and I'd had an MRI and it had been found to be calcification!!!! This was all done privately so wasn't in the hospital's records and I hadn't even mentioned it to my hubby as there was so much going on at that time plus I hadn't yet met my medical onco who was looking after me in hospital. That early work also found that I have arthritis in my lower spine (middle aged back lol). Moral of the story - plenty of blobs can show up on the scans that aren't mets. Obviously we all need to get them checked but not go overboard with worry before getting the results. On the T. I can't remember if you're HER2+ but if so, T plus Herceptin gives the best result. Either way, there are a couple of options that don't require you to stop. One is to reduce the dose and the other is to switch to weekly paclitaxel, which is just as effective, but with much easier side effects. Probably worth discussing with your onco on Tuesday.

You don't need to use it at other times, although if your treated area feels hot and burny then you can smooth some on.  I originally stopped using the R2 about 2 weeks after I finished radio. However, after about a month I felt my skin in the treated area starting to go a bit leathery so I started again. I'm still using it. Also, I'm quite big and found I needed to use 2 sachets at once to thoroughly moisturise the area.  I have seen people offer leftovers through this site but I decided to keep mine. As I said I'm using the moisturiser and I think the R1 might be useful for household burns. (I'm always burning myself in the kitchen lol). It's proved very good for that too. Best Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn Best of luck for your treatment. After the first one it won't seem nearly so scary.  I agree with others that you have to drink a lot of water. I did 3 litres in the first 24 hours after chemo and 2 litres a day after that. When I couldn't face the taste of water I drank very weak Ribena. That did the trick. I didn't have much appetite so tried to make sure that whatever I ate was ok nutritionally. I basically lived on tomato soup, tinned pineapple, cherry tomatoes, grapes and small pieces of cheese. Oh and the dry biscuits I kept to keep the nausea at bay. Occasionally I had fresh orange juice at a local cafe - that was delicious!  Initially I put on weight - mostly fluid from the steroids - but then I got ill and have since lost a net 33kg (about 3 stone I think). A friend of mine, however, ended up a stone heavier so you can't really tell.  Wishing you all the very best - may your SEs be mild and may you sail through it like a pro. Best Lynn xx",

He was a very sick kitten, to the point where we had to feed him water with a syringe every hour, but he's recovered well and is a perfectly healthy and energetic young man. My husband said that, when I was very ill in hospital from chemo, he'd look at Kacang for inspiration. If he could get well, then so could I. I have and Kacang is a very special cat.

In fact, I rather enjoyed being bald - no bad hair days and I've had 60+ years of them. I was also surprised that I didn't and don't feel any less feminine for having no hair (well I have a bit now) and only one boob. In a perverse way I feel more feminine - sort of 'you can do all this to me but I'm still a woman'.  Having said that, I do not like shave the head events. Mostly because everyone I've known who has done it (about 12 ppl so small sample) thought they were some kind of hero or martyr for doing so. That seems to me to mock the seriousness of a cancer diagnosis and the effect it has on those going through it. I also recognise that many if not most fellow BC travellers have more issues with their hair loss than I did. In my view Macmillan, of all organisations, should respect their client group and if even one person finds it objectionable, it shouldn't happen.  Best to all Lynn",

Like you, I accept that pharmaceutical companies need to recoup the costs of research and development, even if the drug comes from a natural product (as the taxanes do). It's not simply a question of turning a plant into a pill. For this reason, I don't accept any of the big pharma conspiracy theories that do the rounds from time to time. That said, I do wonder sometimes at the price they set on new drugs. Countries like the UK via the NHS and here in Australia via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, negotiate the price of supply and I'm sure other countries do too. The prices vary enormously, which I guess is down to the various governments' ability to negotiate. Pity the poor folk in the USA who don't have a government run system for the supply of drugs. I am of course a beneficiary of the system. My hubbie calculated the total cost of my treatment over the last 14 months as close to A$1 million (almost 600,000 pounds). This includes GP visits, scans, radiotherapy and hospitalisation, as well as the various drugs I've been given. Of this I've paid about $1000. Makes you think doesn't it.

When I was on chemo, I started getting really puffy after 2 AC treatments. This continued for another 2 treatments and I was like a balloon by then. It was all fluid - I put on 10 kg in 3 weeks (about 1.5 stones). If it had just been that I'd have been able to cope but I did get other problems especially shortness of breath to the point where I could hardly walk from the front door to the car.  It turned out that my body doesn't deal well with steroids, especially dexmethasone and that adverse reaction plus chemo caused all sorts of problems, the worst being pulmonary embolisms and steroid-induced diabetes.  I'm not saying that you'll get those problems but I do think that you should see your GP and not get fobbed off. It does need to be taken seriously, not because of the fluid itself, but other possible consequences.  Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

There was someone on here recently who developed one about 4 months after surgery. She broke her arm on the good side and thought that caused the seroma to form. I just can't remember who it was. It of course may be lymphoedema developing so you might want to get it checked by the dr and perhaps get some physio. Are you still doing the exercises? They do help a lot with fluid, especially in the arms. I do them 3 x per day still.",

My GP selected her after asking numerous colleagues, as he's only lived here a couple of years. She was great at explaining everything and did show me pictures of her work. I asked her if she is an artist, to which she replied \"no, I'm a sculptor\". She made me a perfect new boob and then when I had to have my implant removed months later, she did a very neat mastectomy. I can't fault the level of care and I still see her. Guess that's the benefit of private medicine! Cheers Lynn xx",

Then I decided to see what happened if I didn't get it drained. It has stabilised and definitely isn't getting bigger. Sometimes I think it's a little smaller, and then I think I'm kidding myself. It's hard to the touch but doesn't hurt and isn't inflamed.  Anyway, today I had my 6 monthly checkup with my surgeon. Her view is that it's better left alone if it's not getting bigger and isn't infected. She said that eventually the amount of pressure in the seroma stops any further leakage from the small vessels and then they're able to heal properly. After that the body gradually absorbs the fluid.  It seems like a logical explanation, but unfortunately she wouldn't or couldn't say how long it will take. Guess I'll just plod on with it.",

      "Content": "Hi Andysis  My mum also has Alzheimer's and lives in a care home as she wouldn't be safe in her own home. Nothing about dealing with her is easy as she just doesn't remember anything you tell her. She hasn't had cancer but did fall and break her hip, necessitating a hip replacement. She found the stay in hospital very confusing and disturbing so one of the family had to be with her as much of the time as possible. Now she's healthy again but doesn't remember the minor changes in lifestyle that she's supposed to do, in order to stop her falling eg wearing sensible shoes all the time (she still likes to go out in her slippers or barefoot), not walking over rough ground and using her walker if she's going more than 10 metres. As a result she's already had another fall.  So, not as bad as being diagnosed with cancer, but I do understand where you're coming from. I'm pretty sure I would have made the same decision as you have if that's any reassurance. I wouldn't subject my mother to surgery again unless absolutely essential. I presume your mum is having hormone therapy ie letrozole or one of the other aromatase inhibitors. They do a good job of controlling the spread of hormone positive BC and for that reason are used extensively in the treatment of secondary BC. I have also read somewhere (although ironically I can't remember where) that often with elderly people, the cancer is slow growing and something else is likely to get them first, so to speak.  The other important thing is to be mindful of the possibility of pain. Usually primary BC doesn't cause much, if any, pain but secondaries often do. Additionally, the aromatase inhibitors can cause achiness in the joints and muscles. Your mother deserves to be pain-free but may not complain about any symptoms. I'd suggest asking her on a regular basis as there are plenty of pain meds out there.  Wishing you and your mum all the best.",

Any cancer diagnosis takes a massive  toll on your emotions and we all recover at different rates. Some good suggestions already to help you and I'll add one - how about a Moving On  course. A lot of people have found them very helpful. In the meantime I'd suggest reading a fantastic article by Dr Peter Harvey called After the treatment finishes then what? Ifound it really helpful. Sorry I can't link it, but it's easy to find.  As far as the tiredness and hard breast are concerned, it does take quite some time to recover fully. Just eat well,don't push yourself and try to get some exercise. Of course, see your doctor if you think you're getting worse. Finally never forget it's great that your BC was picked up early and there's every chance you're fixed.  Wishing you all the best ",

I had mine inserted on my chest on the good side just above my boob, but a number of people had them inserted underneath the boob on their good side, so the scar didn't show. That seemed to work fine too.  The only issue is that some ports won't give ie you can have any infusion through the port but it won't give blood. That happened to a few people I came across. Then they had to have their bloods done using a vein - I did that mostly anyway as I have good veins and it was quicker than accessing the port.  I highly recommend a port if it's on offer.",

Two litres a day and 3 litres in the first 24 hours after treatment or if you have diarrhea. I had 3 x 750ml bottles which I'd fill each morning.

In fact I get really cross with some of the stuff promoted on places like facebook cos as far as I can see they're taking advantage of people who are in a bad place and often fleecing them.  The pseudo-science makes me mad too. I mean articles that use scientific language but if you read carefully, it's actually bullsh*t with little adherence to real scientific principles. And of course, if coconut oil or turmeric or whatever the latest fad might be really cured cancer, wouldn't scientists have worked it out and big pharma made money out of it??? Conventional treatment: surgery, chemo, radio, AIs, targeted therapies,actually works; maybe not in every case, but in the vast majority of BC cases. That's why they're conventional. And as my onco said - they're trying to fix you up, not kill you.  Anyway, rant over.

I knew already that soy isn't the best thing for women who've had ER+ BC, as it contains high levels of a plant-based oestrogen type hormone. The jury's still out on whether that affects women in the same way as their own oestrogen but why not avoid it. Mind you I still drink soy sauce lol, especially the sweet Indonesian one kecap manis.  Karen Lacomtekp - maybe you should switch to lentil burgers! I make them regularly using brown or puys lentils. Delicious.  I was the poster girl for bad living - high responsibility, high stress job, too much alcohol, smoking, way overweight, too much fat and sugar (both yummy of course, especially cake and cheese, not necessarily together), love my red meat, zero exercise. I always thought I'd have a health train wreck at some point. Funny thing is, I thought I'd probably have a heart attack as bad hearts run in the family but my heart is perfectly healthy! And there's no cancer on either side so who can tell. Unlike you though, Carolyn, I've always loved my food - good, bad or indifferent. I loved school dinners as it was a chance for an extra meal lol.  So now, I'm being well-behaved. I have mostly cut out the junk food (except I allow myself chips once a month and a cake on alternate fortnights). We have always eaten a lot of veggies as my husband is a former vegetarian. He grew up as a vegetarian but started eating meat after he met me. I think that has more to do with living in Australia than anything else as the meat here is good quality and relatively cheap. Now though, I make far more purely veggie meals and we eat a lot of pulses. I still eat meat and dairy, but I limit the amount of cheese and I haven't had alcohol for over a year. I've also started exercising every day.This was more for rehab after my period of great unwellness but I've managed to keep it going since November 2015.  I still love my food and I've found my slightly revised diet a fascinating challenge - all those different delicious meals to cook. My current favourite cookbook is Jerusalem by Yotam Ottolenghi and another chap. Brilliant, slightly different and out there food and full of healthy pulses and vegetables. Highly recommend.  All in all, I am fit, I've lost 38kg (5 stone), I'm healthy and I'm happy with that. I don't feel a need to become more rigorous with any of those boring diet or exercise thingys and as ronstar said, I'd prefer to focus on the positives - what I want and need to do and be, rather than restricting myself and focusing on negatives. Love to all Lynn xx",

Frankly, the best thing for me has been regular paracetamol.  And as for nails, mine have been delaminating and flaking ever since I had chemo (Aug 15 to Jan 16). I bought some IBX treatment a couple of weeks ago to use at home, but haven't yet found the time to do it as you basically can't use your hands for 2 hours. However, I've noticed in the last week that my nails have suddenly stopped flaking. I don't know why as I've not used any different creams or anything. Maybe just maybe they're finally recovering. If so, it means you've only got a couple of months to go. Unused IBX kit anyone?",

There are people from all round the world, apart from me in Australia - France, Ireland, South Africa to name a few. I agree about the different terminology - I had the same problem at first. I think we use some British terminology and some American (probably not surprising). You do get used to it eventually but if there's anything that's not quite clear, just ask - someone will know. Yes radiation = radiotherapy and my favourite - in the US and Aust we say lumpectomy, but in the UK they say WLE, which stands for wide local excision; it took me ages to work that one out as it's not obvious.  I looked at various groups in the US and in Australia but none matches up to Macmillan in my opinion. Mainly because there's a real culture of friendliness and empathy in this group. People won't be able to help you with issues relating to things like health insurance but then I can't help people with their National Health Service issues. I haven't found that to be a problem.

The only guaranteed diagnostic tool is a biopsy and even that can be wrong if the sample is taken from a part of a lump that only has benign tissue. However, ultrasounds and MRIs give very good pictures and radiologists and oncologists look at hundreds of these pictures so I'm pretty sure they know what they're looking at the majority of the time. There are of course rare cases where they get it wrong, but usually if they have any suspicion they will order a biopsy.  However, if you remain concerned then you should push for a biopsy. I do know at least one person Carolyn28 whose cancer was missed during scans. I've tagged her in case she has something to add. Could you afford to go private just for this bit? If not, then I'd ask for a second opinion. Apart from anything else, you'll just keep worrying unless you have a definitive answer. ",

As for specific rules for chemo ... I was told to drink 3 litres in the 24 hours following chemo and 2 litres every other day. This included soup and herbal teas but not regular tea or coffee. I used to go get my bloods done early in the morning (about 7.30) so I'd drink about 500 ml beforehand to make sure my veins were plump. To make the counting easier I had 2 x 750 ml bottles which I'd fill each morning and made sure to drink them during the day. The balance came from OJ, soup and fruit tea. My creatine level was out of whack during chemo (I can't remember whether it was high or low lol) but neither my onco nor my GP were concerned as they expected it to settle in the months following chemo and herceptin. My GP will do a blood test 12 months after I finished H and check it then.  Hugs",

Unfortunately I now have to have surgery to clean it all out. So the moral of the story is get on to it as soon as you can and don't take no for an answer.  What I really wanted to tell the lovely ladies is that I've found a couple of really helpful items online. Firstly a gentle compression garment that looks like a shirred sun top - not medical at all. Secondly a pad that goes underneath it with thin and thick bits to get the lymph moving. Both have helped, especially to keep my skin in good nick. Happy to share details if anyone's interested. ",

      "Content": "Hi Baduki1. It's not easy is it, having to make this decision when you know not a lot about the consequences of the different options. I know that when I had my first surgery, I was still bewildered by the diagnosis and found it really difficult to analyse anything objectively.  I started out with a saved skin mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with implant. I had a lovely perky breast and healed quickly and all in all I was very happy with it. However, I got really ill during chemo and put on a lot of fluid (about 10kg). Eventually it all went, except in my reconstructed breast, which was like a football on my chest. Lots of things were tried but eventually I had to have it sorted out with surgery as the implant had distorted. By that time, I was so sick of the whole business that I told my surgeon to just chop it off. She did so, but did try to persuade me to have another reconstruction, both then and when I've seen her since.  I'm quite happy with one breast and I doubt I'll ever bother with reconstruction. I don't feel any less feminine; rather in a peculiar way, I feel more feminine - along the lines of they can take my boob but I'm still a woman. So overall, I'm pretty happy with life right now and just grateful to be healthy.  Wishing you all the best.",

I love that they mean I can wear ordinary bras. I've made several, including a couple filled with shower scrunchies for swimming. I always pin them inside my bra/swimmers so no chance of a wardrobe malfunction. Through trial and error, I've found that a good quality acrylic is the best yarn to use. Wool can be a bit scratchy, especially on my radiated side, and cotton (which I used for my first swimming knocker) takes too long to dry. I have also found that DK/8 ply wool is easier than 4ply and I start with 3 stitches on each needle and sew the little hole up to make a \"nipple\". Much less fiddly than dealing with 1 stitch on each needle and just as effective.  Happy crafting everyone.",

We just do what we can to lower the risk. I had stage 3, grade 3, HER2+ with 14/30 lymph nodes involved. The onco said it was a \"nasty aggressive cancer\" so I decided to take whatever they offered - surgery, node clearance, ACT chemo, Herceptin, AIs, and denusomab injections for the bones so far. And I'll take anything else he suggests too. Plus I take metformin for diabetes and statins for cholesterol - both supposedly have anti-cancer properties. However, here I am 18 months from diagnosis and fit and healthy. Long may it continue! Best Lynn xx",

Hard to know whether it's just side effects or something more serious - I didn't have the same combo so I've no direct experience.  The most important thing though is are you checking your temperature regularly? Please don't hesitate to go to A&E if you're running a temp (some places say 38 and some 37.5C). If you have an infection it's really important to get antibiotics into you quickly as your white blood cell count will be low by now.  Let us know how you get on in the next day or so and in the meantime, look after yourself.

Docs told me it would settle but it hasn't. 3 months later, I'm now told I had a seroma which has septated (ie developed a lot of fibrous tissue), meaning they can't drain it. Unfortunately I now have to have surgery to clean it all out. So the moral of the story is get on to it as soon as you can and don't take no for an answer.  What I really wanted to tell the lovely ladies is that I've found a couple of really helpful items online. Firstly a gentle compression garment that looks like a shirred sun top - not medical at all. Secondly a pad that goes underneath it with thin and thick bits to get the lymph moving. Both have helped, especially to keep my skin in good nick. Happy to share details if anyone's interested. ",

The conversions are  4 ply yarn, No 10 or 3.25mm needles  Double knit/8 ply yarn, no 8 or 4 mm needles (the instructions for this are in brackets).   I find using DK/8 ply acrylic gives the best result. I have used cotton but it's heavy and takes ages to dry. It works perfectly well if you start with 3 stitches on each needle and just sew up the tiny hole. It's also much less fiddly.",

I've chosen to confront all the nasties that happened to me head on and deal with it that way. It's much the same as choosing to go commando when I had no hair. I'm even thinking of volunteering at the ICU as I reckon I'd be a shining example of how someone can recover and might give some hope to some of the poor people whose loved ones are where I was.  I'm in Australia so I had a choice of public or private treatment more or less automatically. I ended up having a mix of both - I had radio in the public system as that's all that's offered here in Canberra, presumably because of the cost of the machines. And when I had my period of great unwellness, my onco wanted me to be in the big public teaching hospital so the full range of specialists was instantly available. Fortunately he practises there and privately so he was in charge of my treatment in both systems.  As someone wise once said worry about the things you can control and don't worry about those you can't.  I know you're not quite finished with treatment but do read this article by Peter Harvey. I found it extremely helpful After The Treatment Finishes - Then What ? Best Lynn xx",

Everyone's journey is different though as I didn't get most of the standard SEs - no nausea, mouth ulcers, infection so I'm thankful for that. The good news is that I finished chemo 8 weeks ago and now feel terrific, although I'm slightly anaemic still. The body has a marvellous capacity to recover!  Careful with the internet - there's a lot of rubbish out there. I suggest you stick with the reliable sites like here, the cancer research one, a couple of American sites like cancer.org and the Mayo clinic. They won't lead you astray but remember not to rely on Dr Google - he's very scary. And as for your hubbie - don't feel guilty. For better for worse and all that. Truly, as George said, most men are glad to help rather than feel useless - I know mine is. And if he's not then that's his problem.  Wishing you well for the rest of your journey. Lynn",

      "Content": "Hi Lizz - I bet a day after your first chemo you'll be thinking 'what was I worried about'. I certainly did. You sound rather like me - I hadn't been to a doctor for about 20 years until I found my lump nor to the dentist for about 15 years! Mainly cos I don't like either! I really struck lucky though. I went to a walk in clinic and waited in the queue only to get a fabulous Irish doctor who'd come to Oz because of the GFC. He's been my best friend through all of this - including saving my life by recognising that I had an embolism. The only point I'd add in relation to teeth/dentists is that the mouth is one of the easiest ways to get an infection when your immune system is low. If not going to the dentist, make sure you have a rigorous mouth washing routine right from day 1 - several times a day, esp after eating. I was given bicarb soda mouthwash by the cancer centre and it was fantastic. No mouth problems all the way through. I don't know if you can buy it in France or whether they'll give it to you but there are plenty of recipes on the Internet.  I have a portacath and haven't regretted it for a minute. No trouble at all and you can do anything - shower, swim etc cos it's completely under your skin. There's a sharp sting from the needle when they access the port but it's momentary. I've heard that some people are given anasthetic patches to put on beforehand so if you're worried, perhaps ask for them. Best of luck Lynn xxx",

My only excuse is that there has been a bit of difficulty recently with the notifications (computers, sigh) and somehow your post slipped through the net.  I had spread to the axillary nodes but not further.I did have radiotherapy to the supraclavicular fossa area in addition to the usual chest RT as the docs were concerned about possible spread to the lymph nodes there. No one mentioned the chest nodes though! I don't know whether that counts as local spread or distant metastases.  Let me say first that I have no medical training whatsoever, and only know what I've picked up from being a patient and from long conversations with my oncologist. I do know though that the most likely places BC will spread to are the bones, lungs, liver and brain. Occasionally you hear of spread somewhere else eg someone was talking about eye metastases a few months back, but that's very rare. What I also know is that, while metastatic breast cancer is considered incurable, it is not untreatable. There are many ladies with metastatic BC on this forum who have been living with good quality of life for several years.  Radiotherapy does deliver good results in preventing further spread. It's also not as tough on the body as chemo so it may well be a good option for your mum. I sailed through radio but nearly died during chemo!  I'm sorry I can't give you more info about chest node involvement.   I'm tagging Dreamthief, a very experienced champion in the breast group, in case he is able to give you more information.  You could also post a question in the Ask a Nurse section of this site as there are some pretty experienced nurses looking after that section.  Please do stick around. We're actually a friendly bunch and happy to provide ongoing support to both patients and their carers. Wishing your mum and the rest of the family all the best.",

I decided early on that I would do everything  I could to reduce the risk of the BC returning - that's meant surgery, chemo, radio, herceptin, AIs and Denusomab injections so far - and I'll take whatever else is on offer. My view is that each of these treatments reduces your risk by a few percentage points and all those percentage points add up. I would hate myself if I didn't do something and the cancer came back. I was 61 at diagnosis and want as many years as possible. Also very importantly, I took into account my husband's point of view. I believe that it's not just my decision, it's about our life together. I had a very horrible time with chemo - nearly died from atrial fibrillation and pulmonary embolisms which caused respiratory arrest and other nasties. Despite that I would do it all over again in a flash. Finally for Carolyn - Here in Australia the cops will happily book you for doing a couple of km over the limit and so do the speed cameras lol. Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

The site is playing up right now but once it settles down it'll be fine and everything is pretty easy, even if you're not that skilled with computers.  Now as for knitted knockers, here's the crochet pattern (you'll see it on the list near the top): https://www.knittedknockers.org/downloads/ I'm not very good at crochet so I've stuck to knitting them so I don't have any tips. I've found that a good quality acrylic yarn works best. Wool can of course be itchy and cotton is comfortable but takes quite a long time to dry. I did buy one cheapie acrylic but the knockers didn't last - they went misshapen after a few washes. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Fatpuffin The basic answer to your question is that yes it is completely normal to feel grotty 7 months after chemo etc. I was told it can take up to 2 years to recover fully.  All of these drugs (tamoxifen, Zoladex and the three aromatase inhibitors) will also make you feel below par in some way, at least initially, as the oestrogen is stripped out of your body. Different people find different ones better though and it's a question of working with your onco to find what works best for you.  I don't know much about tamoxifen as it's usually used for pre-menopausal women, and I definitely wasn't pre-menopausal. If you're pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal, the docs (I think) are probably considering something in addition to letrozole for you, perhaps Zoladex? It's all a bit complicated so you need to have a full discussion with your onco before agreeing to anything. As for the AIs (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) at least the first two can cause bone thinning (I don't know about exemestane). Normal practice is for you to have a bone density scan before you start to get a baseline on the condition of your bones. Many women are also prescribed a bone strengthening drug at the same time, often a biphosphonate like zoledronic acid. I have been having denusomab injections instead as that apparently reduces the risk of bone mets more than biphosphonates. However, I read in the 'Ask the Expert' section a few months back that it's not available for this purpose in the UK, except if you're on a trial. I'm in Australia where it's not available either in the sense that the government won't pay for it, but I chose to pay!  The upside is that the AIs have less risk of other serious side effects like heart attack or stroke than Tamoxifen so it's swings and roundabouts.  I found letrozole difficult - I was very achy and sometimes could hardly move. I switched to anastrozole which was better but I was still a bit achy. Then I managed to get the pharmacist to give me the real Arimidex rather than a generic and I've been fine ever since.  So the bottom line is that it takes a bit of trial and error to find the right drug, but it's worth persevering as the benefits are huge for hormone positive cancer.  Wishing you all the best Lynn xx",

I think that much of the way we cope with treatment is due to having a clear treatment plan that we accept and can plod our way through. Any changes are emotionally very tough and I feel for you.  I can't explain why you may not need radio as most people seem to have it. Is your cancer very early eg Stage 1 with no node spread or DCIS? Have you had a good result from chemo? I imagine these issues will factor into your team's recommendation. Definitely something to discuss with your onco - and keep pushing until you get clear answers that you're satisfied with.  I've not seen many people ask about the pros and cons of radio - people are generally less worried about that than about chemo. However, I think my response is the same as with chemo. I'm a believer in throwing everything at it to minimise the chances of recurrence. Every little percentage point adds up.  I don't think delaying surgery is a good idea, even if your son is coming up for exams. Your team wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't necessary. A mastectomy these days is pretty straightforward and people don't stay in hospital for very long. Much of the complication comes from the type of reconstruction you choose as some are more complex than others and take longer to recover from. I was only in hospital overnight and my drain was in for 3 days but I didn't have reconstruction. Others will be able to tell you how long they were in hospital for different kinds of reconstruction and how long the recovery period was. Are you planning to have immediate reconstruction? Is there any chance that, if you've had a good response to chemo, they might only recommend a WLE - this might be something else to raise with your onco? Wishing you all the best.",

Of course any cancer is bad news, but as it goes this is pretty ok. 2 cm is small and most importantly it hasn't spread. This means your chances of getting rid of it and it not coming back are very good.  I'm not sure why you want a double mastectomy and no reconstruction. Do think carefully about it. They can do a pretty good job with recon these days as I'm sure many ladies on here will tell you. I had a mastectomy eventually (long story) but would have loved to keep my fake boob really. And why the double? Is that what the docs are recommending or are you just thinking that it will prevent the cancer coming back? It won't. It'll prevent cancer in that boob obviously but BC can potentially spread to many parts of the body. Now try to enjoy yourself until you see the consultant and not too much checking of Dr Google - he can be very frightening. Oh and by the way, our current favourite cake isn't a cake but peach pie, made with sweet pastry and lovely fresh peaches, which are abundant here in Australia at the moment, flavoured with cardamom.

      "Content": "Hi mistyblue I completely understand you worrying - it's perfectly normal. A diagnosis of breast cancer is probably the most scary thing that's ever happened to you. I can't tell you to stop worrying cos you won't but do try not to let it take over. Take out the worry daily, have a good look at it for a short while and then put it away till tomorrow. Keep yourself busy and do some of your favourite things.  It's hard to speculate what not normal breast cancer means. There are several different kinds so I'm not sure which one is the \"normal\" one. The main things to remember are that breast cancer is very very treatable and over 90% of people survive it. Those that don't are normally old, had other things wrong with them or were diagnosed too late. It doesn't sound like you fit in any of those categories.  Wishing you all the best",

I had plenty of issues during chemo but thankfully infection wasn't one of them.  To chemo or not to chemo is difficult. No one loves chemo but it isn't awful for everyone. There are plenty of people who get through it relatively unscathed and I suspect that we don't hear as much from them.  I agree with whoever suggested getting your pathology report. Having all the facts will help make a sensible decision.",

When I left hospital, I couldn't walk more than about 10 metres ie struggled to get from the car to the house. But hey I'm fine now - fitter than I've been for 20 years.

      "Content": "My hubby, who suffers from depression and anxiety anyway, was indeed beside himself. He's English and doesn't have any family here in Oz but fortunately a couple of my friends and my brother stepped up and looked after him. We're indebted to them. The only thing I probably had beforehand was an overactive thyroid. The steroids caused diabetes, the chemo caused atrial fibrillation, which in turn caused pulmonary embolisms. I was having dose dense AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, every 2 weeks) at the time, which is a pretty tough chemo regime. (Doxorubicin is a close cousin of epirubicin, which is more commonly used in the UK).  I did find out though as a result of all the tests that I'm deficient in something called Protein C. This means that I'm more prone than normal to blood clots. It means I'm on warfarin for the rest of my life but the good thing is that I'm less likely to have a stroke or get DVT from eg flying so every cloud has a silver lining as that wouldn't have been picked up otherwise. I remember when I was a kid one of my dad's party tricks was that he didn't bleed when he was cut. We all thought it was amazing at the time but now I realise that's where I got the Protein C deficiency from! The whole episode has made me much more aware of shortness of breath, which I had for weeks before I crashed. I and my onco and the chemo nurses thought it was a pretty normal SE, as a lot of shortness of breath in chemo patients is caused by low red blood cell count. I'm on to it immediately if anyone in this forum complains of shortness of breath. It might be low red blood cells but it could be a pulmonary embolism and needs to be checked. I'm also very aware of steroids and diabetes. My glucose level went up to 30+ at the worst time, when it should be 5 or less. Even after this period when I had my T chemo and had to have a minimal steroid dose, my blood glucose would go up to about 15 for 48 hours. I don't think we're told enough about this before chemo starts. I should also say that I wouldn't hesitate to have chemo again if I got a recurrence, although I'd probably ask the onco to design a regime that didn't include doxorubicin. And, I'd certainly be much more aware of symptoms/side effects.  Sorry that was probably far too long and boring but it's hard to tell part of the story.  Best",

I can understand your mum worrying and I guess it's possibly you have inherited a clotting problem from your dad, like I did. Still, at least you're alert to it. Make sure you drink loads and try to keep exercising a bit (one of my mistakes was that I became far too sedentary). Also be very alert to breathlessness and report it to the onco and nurses immediately. You may need to be quite insistent as they'll probably say it's just a usual SE, as they did for me (and of course it may be) and do tell them you have a family history of PEs. It might be worth mentioning that to the onco anyway, as it may be preferable for you to have a PICC line or portacath, rather than having to have chemo through the veins in your arm, as that brings a risk of clots too.  Wishing you all the best",

It varies enormously between people and between drugs but I've not heard that any cause hair loss like chemo. My onco told me he'd start me on letrozole cos it's the best for my situation but if I get awful side effects he'll try different ones till I find something I'm happy with.  Best advice I can give you is to be assertive - look out for your own interests and ask for a change if the tamoxifen isn't good for you.

      "Content": "HI Mom74 Welcome aboard the roller coaster. I'm sorry to hear you're feeling rough. It's hard to know how you'll deal with chemo - everyone seems to be different. For some they have a few bad days and are then ok for the rest of the cycle while others just get worse as time goes on. I was in the latter category during AC and in fact got really ill, but then the T part was comparatively easy and I felt not too bad. It can be the other way round too.  The most important thing is to drink loads of water - I was told to drink 3 litres in the 24 hours following a chemo treatment and then 2 litres every other day. Tea and coffee don't count but herbal teas, soup, soft drink all do. I found very diluted orange squash or Ribena was the easiest to get down. I had 3 x 750 ml bottles that I'd fill each morning so I could keep track of how much I was drinking. The second most important thing is to try to exercise, even if it's just a walk round the block. The more you can move the better you'll feel. I hate any kind of exercise but even I admit that's true.  Thirdly, be kind to yourself and don't struggle to do things. In the end it doesn't matter if the house isn't vacuumed or the kids occasionally get takeaway for dinner. Also, your husband is probably struggling too - it can be very tough on the blokes. My husband said that he struggled because he felt useless. As he put it, blokes are brought up to fix things but he couldn't fix this. I'm sure he's doing the best he can and be grateful that he's standing by you and being supportive - many aren't.  Lastly, it seems like a terrible mountain to climb right now but it does pass. You will get through it.  Wishing you all the very best",

Spiractin is used to treat heart and kidney disease and doesn't decrease your potassium levels.  I don't have kidney problems (about the only thing I haven't had lol) but I did have heart and lung problems.Part of the reason why I was given water  tablets is because the docs were worried that I would develop fluid on the lung.

I think most people on here would agree it's the worst part, mentally at least, of diagnosis and treatment.  I think I knew as soon as I found my lump that it was BC. I'd had lumps previously and knew in my heart they were nothing to worry about. This time it was different - I just knew. My lovely GP immediately referred me for \"mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy if indicated\". Then when the radiologist walked into the room and said he was going to do a biopsy, I was absolutely certain it was cancer. All of this meant that I wasn't surprised, shocked or scared when I finally got the diagnosis. I'd done some research, talked to others and even decided which surgeon I was going to ask for. I also had an oncologist in mind but my surgeon (who is fabulous) strongly recommended someone else. I'm glad she did as he's been just the best.  Anyway, stay strong. The best advice I can give you right now is to take it all one step at a time and be kind to yourself. Wishing you all the very best",

I had a bolus for every treatment (25 over 5 weeks) but it was quite heavy and they just laid it over the area to be radiated. Mind you I'd had a mastectomy so it was lying reasonably flat - nowhere for air pockets lol. I was told the purpose of it was to intensify the dose near the skin. They are also used to even out the dose if a lumpy or uneven area is being irradiated (think nose lol). So I doubt you're being told hogwash - not that I'm the big expert lol. You could always ask in the Ask an Expert section - they've got a radiographer at the moment.  Are the \"plasters\" Mepilex dressings? If not, kick up a fuss as they're what you need. I only had one small area, about the size of a pound coin, where the skin disintegrated due to skin on skin rubbing. It was very painful but once I got Mepilex dressings on it, no pain at all. The one I was given was Mepilex lite, which is for wounds that aren't oozing much. It's just like a very thin layer of foam but has a silicon coating so it adheres but doesn't stick. There are other Mepilex dressings for oozy wounds.",

His mum lives in Cornwall, right down the end between Penzance and Land's End. Always a great place to visit.

As an outsider (I live in Australia) what I observe is that the majority of people on here who are in the UK are very happy with their treatment but there is a significant proportion who are not. I'm not saying this to diss the NHS but rather to say that it's important to understand what's happening to you and the treatments being offered, so that, if necessary, you can challenge what you are told or the treatment being offered (or not offered).  It's not that those of us who have read research papers (many many in my case) think that we know better than the scientists, or the doctors for that matter, it's more that knowledge gives us power, especially power over what's happening to us. And I have to say, the doctors and scientists are not gods - they don't necessarily get it right every time. One thing I've found throughout my cancer treatment is that it's important to be an assertive patient - after all, ultimately you are the person who has your best interests at heart and only you can know what's right for you.  Finally, to be honest (to use your words deliberately), I don't think it was particularly nice of you to fire a shot at we who study the research.

I was 62 when I started AIs (first letrozole, then anastrozole) and hadn't had a period at all for about 5 or 6 years. I still got hot flushes/night sweats for the first few months, which was really annoying as I didn't get any when I went through the menopause. I understand it's because the AI strips out even more oestrogen from your body (the oestrogen produced other than by your ovaries) so it's like another menopause. I'm now a year into it and don't have any more. The only symptoms I have are that I find I need lighter bedcovers and I get quite stiff if I sit for an extended period eg a flight or going to the movies. However, I loosen up within a couple of minutes and am ok. Best Lynn xx",

Over 90% chance of survival is good enough for me. Yes chemo is horrid, yes radio is tiring and yes surgery doesn't look the best at first but together they'll give you the best chance of survival.  I can understand that you felt pressured. The worst part of the journey for me was the loss of control - I have always been a leader not a follower and also never liked doctors (didn't go to a dr for over 20 years other than for travel vaccinations). That's all changed - my life is dominated by medical appointments. I don't like it but I accept it.  Please please opt for the conventional route. Even if your immune system has issues to deal with, at least you'll be alive to deal with them.",

Gemcetabine and carboplatin seems to be a well established combination for BC treatment (I saw articles about trials in 2004 - 2008). However, it doesn't appear to be used that often. I don't know why and there don't seem to be any articles dealing with its ongoing use.  That doesn't mean it's a bad treatment. From the little I know, the docs tend to try one drug or combo until that stops working, then try another and so on.

We did and it was great fun - made an awful time into a pretty happy memory.  I chose to go commando all the time as I knew I wouldn't be able to stand wearing a wig, I've always hated hats and the scarf thing just identifies you as a cancer patient.

I'm not saying this is the case for you but I had terrible cramps during chemo but before the period of great unwellness. Turned out to be low magnesium levels, which the docs only identified when I was so ill they were testing everything. Problem is that Mg testing isn't usually included in a full blood count. Might I suggest that the next time you have a scheduled blood test, you ask them to check your Mg levels too. And on radiotherapy. It's not the number of sessions but the number of Grays you're given overall. Different places give RT in different fractions but the total is usually somewhere between 45 and 60 grays. There have been various trials testing different levels but I confess I haven't been following them.  If you're already having skin problems, you'll need to pay even more attention than most to your skin during radio. I used R1 and R2 cream and they were wonderful but there are others. Make sure you avoid cream containing sodium lauryl sulfate. If you do get lesions, then I highly recommend mepilex dressings. They self stick and peel off easily but protect the skin really well. They're quite expensive so you might have to fight for them (I didn't but some people have had to) but it's worth it.  It sounds like you're going through a rough patch right now so here's another big hug for you from me.",

Personally I found the paclitaxel much much easier than the AC I had, although for some people it's the other way round. Are you having weekly paclitaxel? I did and managed 9/12 before my onco stopped them because I had peripheral neuropathy.  I can understand that you hate having different oncologists see you. I went private so had the same chap from the outset, and I still see him for checkups. I don't think I'd like to see different people all the time - I'd feel the need to explain each time - how tiresome. Anyway, keep plugging on with it, stay strong and maintain the vigilance.

I had one ready all the time (bit like pregnancy) but fortunately never needed it. - drink heaps in the 24hrs after chemo to flush it out. I'd do about 3 litres. Makes you feel much better. - get on to any nasty side effects or health issues immediately - you don't want to end up really ill - keep asking questions and checking - after all, you're the person who's most interested in your health.

Mind you I have plenty of reserves so it wasn't a problem. It is mostly the steroids that cause weight gain - both from carb cravings and fluid retention. I ended up having very lose doses of steroids, which probably partly explains why I lost weight. The most important thing at the moment is, I think, to eat good food - lean protein, salads, fruit to give your body as much ammo as possible for the onslaught. During chemo I found that I didn't want to eat many of the foods I'd normally eat and lived on eggs, tomato soup, cherry tomatoes and grapes. The last two tasted fabulous - much better than normal. And even other fruit was good.  Wishing you all the very best. Lynn xx",

I'm still having infused herceptin so will keep it till I finish. It's so easy - they just access the port with a needle, flush it, take blood, start a saline infusion and then the chemo drugs. Pull the needle out at the end and you're back to normal. However, putting it in the arm seems a bit odd. Mine feeds directly into the superior vena cava, one of your main veins. I thought that's how they were meant to work. Also it does make a lump under your skin, which could rub if it's on your arm. Mine is placed like Karen's - about 6cm below my collarbone on the unaffected side of my chest. I have also seen a few people with them placed against the ribs under the boob on the good side - on the theory that any scar (or indeed the lump itself) won't show if you wear a lowish cut top.  Highly recommend it!!!!

Firstly congratulations on getting a good outcome from chemo.  Have you spoken to the surgeon about your fear of needles? If your biopsy was done with gas, then can the marker be done the same way? Alternatively, he might be able to offer you valium or some other drug to put you in the twilight zone. I'm sure you're not the first person to have this sort of issue so they must have a way of dealing with it.  Wishing you all the best.",

In addition, is it possible for you to ask your GP? S/he should have some idea of which hospitals are performing well at the moment. My GP went to some lengths to find me the best breast surgeon around (although I'm in Australia which seems better endowed with GPs at the moment - I can always get a same day appointment, unless he's not working of course and then I can see a colleague).",

The short answer is that advice varies between 6 weeks and 6 months, but definitely that your hairdresser should do a patch test first as it's the scalp that is sensitive.

      "Content": "I had my first surgery (saved skin mastectomy, implant, node clearance) in June 2015, and my second (mastectomy as the implant failed and I had fluid) in March 2016. I'm still quite numb in that area, although I've noticed a small improvement. From having had shingles recently, I suspect that the itching is the nerves healing, although I couldn't say for sure.  As far as activity is concerned, I agree to avoid swimming till chemo is well and truly out of your system. I tried it once but my skin felt horribly tight and uncomfortable afterwards.  I was dreadfully ill during chemo and was seriously unfit (struggling to walk the hospital corridor). I live in a very hilly area and wasn't up to walking it and I knew if I had to drive somewhere to walk on the flat, I wouldn't keep at it. So I bought an exercise bike and started with 2 mins per day, with no resistance. I now do 20 mins with intervals, including some on the highest resistance. A friend who's a cycling coach told me that's enough for general fitness.  Also, I've found it very important to keep going with the arm and shoulder exercises that I was given straight after my first surgery. It definitely helps to keep my shoulder area loose and without pain.  The most important thing is to do a little bit and gradually build up. You'll find that your strength and fitness will return.

I can't exactly remember when it appeared, definitely not directly after my mastectomy, but possibly a couple of months later. I've had it drained several times (about 5 or 6 I think) but it comes back within a week or so. It's almost like a boob but a bit too high - right up level with my armpit. To be honest, I've given up worrying about it. I'm due for a surgeon's check up in April so I'm trying to hold off till then without getting it drained, so she can see it in its full glory. Last time I had it drained, the radiologist asked me twice if I was sure that I didn't have an implant. (Did he think I'm stupid? - possibly) It doesn't appear fluidy cos it's hard but it is full of fluid. Don't panic too much - the doc will probably just want to ultrasound it so s/he can see what's going on. Let us know how you get on. Best",

I was very breathless during chemo but put it down to expected side effects, and I have to say neither my onco nor the chemo unit seemed particularly concerned. I got to the point where I could hardly get to the toilet, and getting up to open the front door was a major exercise. Fortunately I had to go to the GP for something else. He immediately swung into action - within a couple of minutes I was on oxygen and half an hour later I was in an ambulance. I had pulmonary embolisms, which nearly killed me (respiratory failure and a coma for 3 days). Bless my lovely GP for spotting it! The moral of this story is yep it could be expected side effects like possibly low red blood cell count, or it could be something way more serious. I don't mean to scare you but it really is worth keeping on at the docs and go to A&E if it gets any worse. Best",

      "Content": "Just to add my thoughts, although it looks like you've made your decision RoseKen1 I originally had a silicon implant and ended up with a very attractive perky boob that made the other one look positively tired and old. However, I had problems during chemo and accumulated a lot of fluid all over. Eventually it went, except in my reconstructed breast, which was like a football on my chest. After many consults and much physio surgery was the only option left to fix it. I was so sick of the whole business that I opted for a full mastectomy and I haven't regretted it for a moment. Yes I'm lopsided Lizzie but I'm very comfortable with that. I don't feel damaged or less feminine and the scar is a nice fine line. I think I'm much happier this way than I would be with an implant.  One other point that doesn't seem to have been mentioned (apologies if I missed it). It can be better not to have an implant if you are to have radiotherapy. Implants can make it more difficult for the radiation beams to be targeted correctly and the radiotherapy can cause what's called capsular contracture, where fibres grow round the implant and squeeze and distort it. If that happens the implant has to be removed.  Hope it all goes well for you.",

      "Content": "Hi Maria. Clear margins means they got all the cancer in your breast with a margin of healthy tissue around it. That's the point of having surgery.  Chemo has a different purpose. It is designed to kill cancer cells wherever they've migrated to in your body. If there are just a few cells, they will be too small to be picked up on a scan. HER2+ BC is a more aggressive type, making chemo and Herceptin more important. The oncos always recommend chemo and herceptin if you're HER2+.  If you had no evidence of spread to your lymph nodes, it's less likely any cells are circulating round your body. But not guaranteed. Indeed, there was someone on a thread today who said they had no lymph node spread but have a small spinal metatisis.  Radio is different again. It's designed to give some heavy duty treatment to the area near where your cancer was found, again to prevent recurrence. Your onco will be able to explain all this at your appointment. I suggest that you make a list of all the questions you want to ask him/her as I guarantee they'll go right out of your head on the day lol. Can also be helpful to take someone along with you - four ears are better than two. Wishing you all the best. Lynn xx",

Too many GPs are telling us it's \"normal\" to have low moods, anxiety etc. and then expect us to go away and get on with life with no treatment. Wrong! There are treatment options available eg anti-depressants, counselling, CBT. Quite possibly people may choose not to have treatment but that's different from not being offered. I suspect it's much the same for women going through menopause, without the added burden of tamoxifen.  OK rant over. Several people on here and others I know have found help with venlafaxine. It's an anti-depressant but also helps with hot flushes etc. Those of you who are suffering anxiety and low moods might think about raising this as a possibility with your doctor.  Big hugs to all that are suffering. ",

      "Content": "Hi Bazzy. It must be a difficult and worrying time for you. That's completely normal - after all, getting a cancer diagnosis is one of the scariest things that can happen to anyone. I can assure you though, once you get your pathology results and have a treatment plan, things will settle down and you'll just put one foot in front of the other and keep going until you come out the other side.  You said you don't have your HER2 results but do you have any others? Do you know the stage and grade and was it hormone (ER and/or PR) positive? Also, have they told you whether there was any (armpit) lymph node involvement? All these will contribute to the treatment plan they come up with.  If your tumour was HER2+, they will definitely offer you chemo as chemo plus herceptin plus pertuzumab is the gold standard treatment for that type of BC. If it was hormone positive, you may not be offered chemo as that's not necessarily the best treatment. If it was what's called triple negative (ie HER2 and hormone negative) then you will be offered chemo as that's the only effective treatment. So you can see why the onco needs to wait till he gets the full pathology results.  In the meantime, try to relax and take the time to recover from your surgery. The cancer is now gone so a week or two here or there makes little difference. My advice would be not to think too far ahead. but take it one step at a time. Try to avoid Dr Google as you can frighten yourself badly and much of the information out there is unreliable or out of date. If you must research, then stick to the well known sites like Macmillan and Cancer Research UK.  Finally, you're right to write your questions down. I found my mind went blank as soon as I walked in the doc's office. Make notes of what he tells you too as you won't remember it all later. Do feel free to come back to this group and ask as many questions as you like or just have a rant. There are lovely supportive people here who'll help you through.  Wishing you all the best.",

And very good news on the chemo results. Reconstruction isn't an easy decision - risks and benefits with all options. Did he mention that there can be problems with radiotherapy if you have an implant. Firstly, the implant makes the actual radiotherapy harder to plan as it gets in the way. Secondly, the radiation can cause your implant to harden or can cause capsular contracture, where bits of tissue grow round the implant squeezing it. In the worst cases, the implant has to be removed. The only reason I mention this is because no one told me until I had my first radio planning appointment and then the radio oncologist just kept going on about it. As it turned out I had to have my implant removed and a full mastectomy before radio (for other reasons) but it was definitely a serious issue for the radio oncologist.  Hope it all goes well, whatever you decide.",

The normal range is 55% to 70%. Herceptin can affect your heart so the docs keep a close eye on it during Herceptin treatment. The NICE guidelines specify a scan before you start, to get a base measurement and then every three months after that. It can either be a MUGA scan or an echocardiogram. Your LVEF can drop during treatment and if it drops 10 percentage points or more from baseline and to below 50% then treatment will probably be suspended. Often the heart will recover sufficiently to allow treatment with H to resume.  Just to illustrate: my LVEF was 68% before I started H. Over the 12 months it dropped to high 50s. Six months after finishing it was back to 69%. So, some impact but not enough for the docs to be concerned and then a full recovery pretty quickly.  Best",

Once you have a full treatment plan in place, you'll find that everything becomes a lot less daunting and you just keep going.

I developed pain in my hip a few months back when I was away on holiday in Bali. Happens every time I go as the beds are far too hard (Asian style) but this time, I was convinced I had bone mets, especially when the ache persisted for a while after I got back. I was waiting for my next check up to mention it (scheduled for about 6 weeks after I returned) but guess what - it had gone by then. Going again in a couple of weeks so no doubt I'll have the same problem lol and will go through the same thought processes. It's good though that you mentioned it to your hospital and GP. It's always better to mention something and be told it's ok than to not mention it and spend ages worrying and possibly delay treatment if it were serious. If the pain persists then mention it again.  In the meantime, some gentle exercise may help to loosen up your body. Do you like swimming? It's very kind to the body as the water supports your weight.  Wishing you all the best Lynn xx",

I found that saying the word cancer out loud in a completely natural way helped me and them come to terms with it. It's a funny thing though - I have a friend who had BC nearly 5 years ago and still can't deal with the word cancer - she got really upset last week when I said I was going to the Cancer Centre after seeing her. Well it's called the Canberra Region Cancer Centre so what else was I supposed to call it! She suggested to just say hospital but I think that's more worrisome as it's unclear why you're going there.  And as for the drain. Most inconvenient but doing it's job. I had one for 14  weeks and only had it removed cos I cheated and convinced the community nurse that I wasn't leaking any more.

Weeding, light pruning (with the good hand/arm), even lawn mowing didn't cause me too much trouble at first but I was unable to do anything heavy like carrying bags of prunings or fertiliser, let alone digging. Also, as chemo progressed I got more and more fatigued and had less and less strength. As for the infection risk, in some ways you're probably less at risk in the garden (not mixing with people and their germs) but of course there's a high risk with cuts, thorns etc. Perhaps those leather gauntlet gloves that go up to your elbow? I use them for rose pruning but I have to say my hands don't have much fine motor movement while wearing them. To be honest, gardening doesn't really sound like a viable proposition during chemo and while recovering from surgery. If you end up having full or partial lymph node clearance, you'll have to restrict your arm work for a while during the healing or you'll expose yourself to the risk of lymphoedema. The Macmillan helpline is very good for advice about claiming entitlements during treatment. Their number is at the bottom of the page and they are open during business hours and till 8pm.  Wishing you all the best from a very amateur gardener.",

      "Content": "I understand where you're at LittleWren - it's not easy is it?  I originally decided to have a saved skin mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and duly had it, with a permanent implant fitted. It was a lovely boob for about 3 months but then I got seriously ill from chemo and as part of that put on a lot of fluid (about 10 kg worth), including in the reconstructed breast which turned into a football sitting on my chest. Eventually the fluid went away - from everywhere except my reconstructed breast. I was told it would sort itself out but it didn't and I ended up with what they call septation. This is basically where fibres grow in the fluid so you end up with something like a sponge with lots of pockets filled with fluid. Also the fibres had grown round my implant, squeezing and distorting it. Had to be fixed surgically. By that point I was so sick of the damned football that I told my surgeon just to chop it off, in other words a full mastectomy. It healed beautifully except I have a seroma which I have to get drained about once a month. I'm happy with wearing a knitted knocker though and don't care that I have no boob.  Clearly I'm a fluidy person so I'm reluctant to undergo reconstruction, in case it sets a new chain of problems in motion. I may change my mind later.  As far as I know there are different kinds of reconstruction, which seem to have different healing times. One I think takes fat from your tummy, and another takes muscle from your back and there are others. Both of these seem to take much longer to heal than a straight implant. One other thing to watch is whether you are to have radiotherapy. Implants before radiotherapy are discouraged because they can make radio more difficult and there can be problems with the implant afterwards. Having said all that, the majority of people in this group who've had reconstructions are very happy with them. Hopefully some will respond to your query. In the meantime, you might like to check this out.  https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/information-support/facing-breast-cancer/going-through-treatment-breast-cancer/surgery/breast-reconstruction  Best Lynn xx",

I'm sorry to see you here but you'll find plenty of help and support.  As for those lymph nodes ... unlike you I'm not in the medical profession, but I'm pretty sure they get zapped if you have radiotherapy, that is if they haven't been removed as part of a WLE or mastectomy, so any nasties there would get dealt with one way or the other. I had a mastectomy and then I had radio - the target area for that included both my sternum and the supra clavicular fossa area to get more lymph nodes. My radio oncologist told me they targeted the expanded area as I had an aggressive type of breast cancer. I think it would be well worth raising your concerns with your surgeon first of all.  It will be a long 7 days but do try to not let the worrying take over.

Bear in mind though that breast cancer is highly treatable, with well over 90% surviving; and many of those that don't make it were either very old, had something else wrong with them as well or were diagnosed too late. HER2+ cancers used to have a worse outcome but the so-called wonder drug - herceptin - has changed that. Be careful looking at Dr Google as some of the survival stats still include people who didn't get herceptin. As time goes by, the figures get better and better. They now give pertuzumab as well as H, with even better results. I agree that the only way is to take it one step at a time. Focus for now on your surgery and healing from that. If you can, it would probably be useful to prepare some freezer meals for when you're not up to cooking. If you don't use them after surgery, I'm sure you will during chemo. From now till surgery, eat well and try to get plenty of exercise so you get yourself as well as possible to deal with the surgery. Wishing you all the very best.",

So glad you have found us as there are heaps of lovely people here who have plenty of knowledge to answer your questions and listen if you need to rant. Your treatment plan sounds almost exactly like mine, except I had 5 weeks of radio, perhaps because I had a mastectomy so didn't need the \"booster\" radio direct to the breast area. Whereabouts do you live? Am I correct in thinking that you're not in the UK? The only reason I ask is that UK people usually have a slightly different treatment plan (EC rather than AC, and 3 weeks radio). They also call a lumpectomy a WLE rather than lumpectomy. I'm in Australia but this is the best most helpful site I've found.  It sounds like the AC treated you reasonably well. I hope the paclitaxel does too.

If not, then rush to your GP and get some as it makes a huge difference. Mine was cleared up within a week; otherwise it'll hang around for about 6 weeks. Perhaps your onco might give you a prescription???  I think your BCN was a bit off not recognising it - shingles is very distinctive as it only affects one side of the body - nursing 101!",

      "Content": "Gloria - I had a portacath and loved it. It worked perfectly for me for the entire 16 months I had it (including having Herceptin by infusion). However, one of the nurses did tell me that 'they all take, but only some give'. In other words, it's not uncommon for them not to be able to draw blood from a port. I mostly had my bloods done by needle in the vein as my veins don't give any trouble (thank goodness). Jenny - fatigue. I had the most awful fatigue you can imagine. I spent the days sitting down or in bed the entire time. Sometimes it was a mammoth effort just to get up to answer the door or go to the toilet. I could probably walk about 20 paces and that's it. However, at the 4 month mark, they discovered I had pulmonary embolisms (clots on the lung) so it's highly likely they were the major contributor to the fatigue. I wasn't nearly as bad for the first month or so, just a bit tired here and there so I suspect the clots started developing in month 2.  I was fine on T - not much energy but not the same level of draining fatigue that I'd had before - I was able to shower, cook, go out for coffee. The one thing I couldn't do for ages was change the bed - I found putting on a new duvet cover just completely overwhelming. Fortunately hubby was happy to do it.  No one knows how badly fatigue will strike you so just roll with it. My best advice is to drink plenty of water or other fluids - 3 litres in the 24 hours following chemo and 2 litres every other day (that's what I was told) and to get as much exercise as you can - even if it's only a 5 minute walk down the street. There's a fair bit of research coming through that shows that exercise reduces the severity of side effects. The other thing is to report side effects to the chemo unit and your oncologist - don't think you're making a fuss, they need to know. I think I downplayed my SEs (fatigue, breathlessness) so much they took a while to pick up on the clots. Best",

Still as I was pulling my top down for him to have a look, my GP said That's shingles so he was on to it immediately.  You may get your chemo delayed by a week but please don't pretend it's ok if it's not as the onco needs the facts. I finished Herceptin last September. Main side effects were drippy nose and flaky nails. The drippy nose is long gone but my nails are still crap. I thought I was feeling fine all through it but I definitely had an upsurge in energy once it was finished so overall I'd say it made me feel a bit below par, but not ill at all. ",

      "Content": "Firstly, welcome aboard the roller coaster jojo1969. It's good that your team is on to it so quickly! Things will start to settle down mentally for you now.  The first chemo is probably the most daunting as you've no idea how you'll feel or react. By the end of that session though you'll feel that it's not as bad as you thought it was going to be. The important things to remember are to drink lots of water beforehand to plump up your veins so they can get the cannula in easily, drink at least 2 and preferably 3 litres in the 24 hours following (to flush it through your body), take a few snacks and a cardi or wrap as you may get cold. I found my Kindle invaluable for entertainment (I went through a lot of trashy historical romances as I couldn't concentrate on anything more serious).  If you haven't had an introductory session with the chemo nurses, they'll probably give you one. That's about what actually happens, the anti-sickness meds to take home, watching your temperature, giving you a contact to ring if any problems and so on. There are heaps of tips from people who've been through it in a file linked at the bottom of crystaljuju's opening post on this thread.  And finally, bear in mind that chemo is very do-able, you just have to look after yourself. Many people get through it with few problems and it's the minority that post here because they are having difficulties.  Wishing you all the best.",

Do you know the pathology of the tumour (hormone positive or negative, HER2 positive or negative)? Also, I know you said you didn't like the idea of a line in you but, believe me, once it's inserted you can't feel a thing. A portacath is better than a PICC line for longer term as there are no bits dangling outside your skin - it's just inserted in your chest and then they use a needle to access it when needed. They can give you local anaesthetic so you don't even feel that needle going in. If you have to have any more chemo, I'd strongly recommend you consider asking for one. Usually I don't recommend internet searches, but have a look and you'll see how straightforward it is.  Wishing you all the best",

I think it very much depends on the doctors involved and the type of cancer you had.  You can feel a bit as though you've been cast adrift when suddenly you're not in their rooms all the time. It's quite scary at first, as though a prop has been taken away, but you'll gradually normalise and get back to your regular routines. The most important thing is to know your body and be alert to any symptoms - lumps, unusual pain that doesn't go away, breathlessness, headaches and so on and if in any doubt, get yourself checked out.  Can I recommend After The Treatment Finishes - Then What ? by Dr Peter Harvey This is a fantastic article that explains so much of what you feel after treatment.

Others have not been so lucky but still have their relationships Carolyn28 comes to mind.  All you can do, I think, is be honest and open with him, but don't waste any emotional energy - you'll need it for yourself. Another hug Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi 1BB Welcome aboard the roller coaster. It's hard to know how chemo will hit you and how much your taste etc will be affected. It's hard to avoid losing your hair though, although some people have had great success with the cold cap. Are you going to try that or just go with the hair loss? As far as tips go, may I suggest that you have a look at the list tagged at the bottom of Crystaljuju's opening post on this thread. Just click on it and the list will open. This is a composite of all sorts of info collected from people here so it's a good starting point.  For me, I found the loss of taste very difficult and didn't want to eat much. I lived on tinned tomato soup, cherry tomatoes, grapes, scrambled egg and fresh orange juice. That's all I could stomach. Even water became difficult but I found that a slight flavouring like Ribena, orange squash or a squeeze of lemon or orange helped a lot. It's very important to drink heaps of water. At least 3 litres in the 24 hours following each treatment and 2 litres every other day. I used to fill 2 or 3 750ml bottles each morning and drink them through the day so I could keep track of how much I was getting into me. NB tea and coffee don't count but fruit tea, soup and similar do.  Also, I highly recommend bicarb mouthwash, used as often as you need to. I was given it by my chemo unit but there are plenty of easy recipes on the internet.  I hope it all goes really well for you Best",

I also had metoclopromide given to me as tabs but hardly needed them. I think most other anti-nausea medication is given by tablet too. I expect the reason you feel wiped out is the cumulative effect of 3 doses of FEC. It's tough stuff and feeling like crap is pretty normal - my chemo nurses called it the red devil. However, do keep a close eye on your temperature, and watch out for breathlessness. Ring your BCN if you have any worries with side effects.  Rest as much as you need to but try to get a little exercise, even if it's only a walk to the corner of your street, as exercise really does help with the fatigue.  Best ",

It's too early to tell how you'll react to chemo and anyway, you'll still be feeling the steroids, which make things seem a bit better.  Try to live in the present (such a cliche I'm afraid) rather than wondering or worrying. If you don't feel too bad right now, celebrate that. If you start to feel bad at some point, deal with it then. Don't waste the time when you feel ok with worrying about feeling not ok later - that's pointless. Let's hope your side effects aren't going to be too bad.  Big hugs",

My response has been to take every treatment offered so I've had surgery, chemo, Herceptin, radio, hormone therapy and Denusomab injections so far (Denusomab is a bone strengthening drug but also offers a significant reduction in the risk of bone mets) and I'll take anything else on offer! I'm way past child-bearing (and rearing lol) so that wasn't an issue for me. I've never really liked children much so I doubt I would have worried, but I know I'm unusual in that. I guess it's worth freezing eggs, so at least you have some option in the future. You're better off than I was though, if your nodes are clear - I had a full clearance and 14/30 were cancerous. As a result of this, I had extra radiotherapy in my supra-clavicular area (near the collar bone) as that's the next point of spread. I had a whole body CT scan and bone scan and also had an MRI of my spine as there were \"suspicious calcifications\". They turned out to be just calcification thank goodness. I can see no reason why you shouldn't get married this year. You should be done with chemo in time for a lovely summer or autumn wedding to celebrate your health. If your fiance sticks by you through this then he's a keeper; if he doesn't then better to know now that he's a git, rather than a few years down the track. I'm now healthier than I've been for years and loving life, so there is hope after an HER2+ diagnosis. Hugs Lynn xx",

I had a pretty terrible time with chemo but am very fortunate that healing after surgery was straightforward for me. I had a portacath so finding veins wasn't an issue. I'm in Australia and here it's standard practice for everyone who needs chemo to be fitted with a port, or at least a PICC line. I think it's wrong that they don't do so in the UK - probably a funding issue.  It sounds like you're healing now - I do hope that continues and you can eventually put this behind you, for the sake of your children.  May I ask at which hospital you're being treated?  Wishing you all the best, with a big virtual hug",

You should already have had a MUGA scan or echocardiogram to check your LVEF and should have them repeated every 3 months. Mine dropped from 68 to 54 over the 12 months, which is still in the healthy range. You only have to worry if it goes below 45. The docs are very aware of this problem and usually monitor you closely.  The main side effect I've had is a persistent drippy nose. Not like a cold, just water dripping unexpectedly out of my nose. Minor but occasionally embarrassing. People here have also mentioned achey muscles. I have that but am not sure whether it's the H or the aromatase inhibitor I also have to take.

However hard we try to put it out of our minds, it's lurking there ready to jump out at the slightest opportunity.  I don't think your surgeon would recommend a lumpectomy unless he was confident that it would deal with the problem but I do understand the feeling that you're safer if you chop off your boobs. I'm not sure that's strictly true however. Firstly, a friend of mine had a full mastectomy and when she went back a year or so later for a reconstruction they found a very small cancer. She was told that they don't necessarily manage to get ALL the breast tissue.  Secondly, recurrence of cancer in your breast is horrid but isn't nearly as bad as return elsewhere (lungs, liver, bones, brain mostly). A double mastectomy won't solve that. It's something you'll have to live with.   I'd suggest talking it over with the surgeon. He can take you through the relative risks. From what people have said on here, surgeons seem to leave the decision up to you but subtly (or maybe not so) push you in the direction they think is best. Be guided by the expert.  Wishing you all the best.",

I've been putting nail hardener (just a supermarket brand by Sally someone - it's made in England) which has really helped hold them together, although I keep them short.

It sounds like that's exactly the case for you.  How long is it since you finished chemo and radio and Herceptin if you had it? My oncologist told me that fatigue can linger around for up to 2 years from the end of treatment. I finished chemo proper in January last year, Herceptin in September, radio in May, I felt that I was pretty ok 6 months after I finished chemo, then I got another burst of energy when I finished Herceptin. However, I do still get really exhausted if I overdo it - I then crash badly. I don't sleep very well either so I'm sure a lot of the problem is that. But overall I feel really well so I'm not too bothered.  Bottom line is that you may well still feel fatigued so don't worry too much, unless it keeps getting worse. I'd mention it to your onco or GP whenever your next visit is. Best of luck",

This included putting on about 10 kg of fluid. Eventually the fluid went from everywhere except my new boob, which was like a football on my chest. That in turn caused capsular contracture. The physio tried everything to get the fluid to shift but nothing worked so eventually surgery was the only option. By then I'd had enough and decided to get my boob chopped off. That was in March 2016. At the time I didn't want a reconstruction because of the fluid issues. I still feel the same - why run the risk? I've been using knitted knockers ever since and am quite happy with them as you just pin them inside a regular bra. Everyone I tell says they can't tell the difference and my hubby doesn't care. I'm lopsided Lizzie at home, but that doesn't worry me either - I'm alive! The only negative for you that I can see is that it's an additional surgery. My current view is to avoid surgery wherever possible lol. Merry Christmas Lynn xx",

      "Content": "You poor thing Puzzle - lymphoedema can be very sore. However, it does seem to be a very early diagnosis. Normally breast lymphoedema (BL) isn't diagnosed for several months after surgery so it can be distinguished from swelling/fluid retention relating to the surgery. BL is tough to deal with. I have it - sometimes it feels like I have a football hanging off my chest - and it makes me wish I'd gone for a full mastectomy rather than a skin saving mastectomy. Little pain though as I have no nerves left in that area - grateful for small mercies! I was referred to a lymphoedema physiotherapist who has been great. Treatment is a combination of manual lymph drainage (gentle massage), taping and compression. I have to massage my breast and chest for 20 mins twice a day and wear an elasticated band around my boobs (like a Victorian corset) for as much time as I can bear. The physio is also going to strap it with kinesio tape next week, although that will make showering impossible, which isn't so great in the Aussie summer! I'll do it though as I have to try to reduce the BL before I have radio.  You're right that there isn't much out there about BL. There's quite a good article on cancer.org - the American cancer society's website but that's all I've found other than ads for compression garments. I have discovered though that up to 70% of people who have breast surgery do get BL. The only other advice I can offer is to say keep up with your exercises. They're really important.  Let us know how you go - I'll be open to suggestions too! Best of luck.",

For 3 months I was told it would go away by itself. It didn't and I ended up with what they call a septated seroma (aka a football on my chest). This is essentially where the breast fills with fluid and then fibres grow through it, making it like a sponge. It's impossible to drain cos the fluid ends up in loads of small cavities. I also had capsular contracture, which is fibres growing round the implant and squeezing it. To cut a long story short, I ended up having the breast removed and I'm much better. My radiooncologist also told me that it's harder to get a good result with radiotherapy if you have an implant (hard for them to get to the chest wall behind the implant). If I had my time over, I'd go for a full mastectomy.  Best of luck with whatever decision you make. Lynn xxx",

Leaving aside the cost of my stay in hospital, it would've been around $300 000 - that's about 185 000 pounds - for surgery (2), chemo, radio, herceptin and appointments with the various doctors. Apart from anything else, I had 4 Neulasta injections - that's $24 000. The cost of Herceptin for a year is US$70 000 in the USA but here in Aust, the govt has managed to negotiate the price down to around A$50 000 (c 31000 pounds), so I guess a similar price would apply in the UK. Scary isn't it but it shows just how blessed we are to live in countries with a good public health system. Like in the UK, the public health system here in Australia is showing the strain, with ever more millions needed to prop it up. The government keeps trying to impose different small charges to try to stem the rising costs but people are naturally resistant. I guess we all believe good public health care is a right, but I'm not sure it can go on forever increasing. Mind you, I'd hate to live in the US where many people cant afford chemo drugs and the biggest cause of personal bankruptcy is medical bills.  Off my soapbox now",

My onco said it was usually temporary if it didn't spread up your arm but if  it spread further than your hand, it could be permanent. In the end, he stopped the chemo after 9 sessions as it was getting too bad. That was end January. Now my right hand is pretty much ok but my left still tingles, especially the ring and little fingers. Not badly enough to prevent me from doing anything though. You'll find it's going to be slow to recover cos nerves take ages to regrow.  I would at least ring your onco's rooms as they do like to keep an eye on neuropathy.  And no need to feel guilty. Everyone has something and that's just the way it is.  Best Lynn xx",

However, both my radio-oncologist and the radio nurses were very kind and explained things very clearly.  I've now had 5 radio treatments (20% through yay!) and I have nothing to show on my skin at all so far. It's a bit red immediately afterwards but that goes within a couple of hours. The worst part for me is the discomfort of having my arms above my head and head turned to the right and having to keep absolutely still for 20 mins or so. I find my shoulder joints get locked and my neck aches. I have resorted to having a stash of neurofen in my bag and taking a couple as soon as I finish. That seems to work! Radio does reduce the risk of local recurrence quite significantly and with an aggressive cancer (HER2+) I went ahead with radio as I want to do anything I can to make sure it doesn't come back.

Understanding contributes a lot to making you feel you have some control over the situation. You're fortunate that there is no lymph node involvement.  Chemo is horrible there's no doubt about that but it is do-able and you'll find amazing reserves of strength to get through it. However, there's no doubt you'll lose some or all of your hair, even with the cold cap. You need to prepare your daughter for that - you are the same person! It's quite possible she's simply reflecting your own fears but she will need to be reassured that her mummy is still the same.  Best of luck with your treatment. Lynn",

The very best thing would be that you've worked yourself into a stew over nothing. What can you do on Tuesday to dislodge the worry, even if only for an hour?  Now about those drugs ... You know very well that aromatase inhibitors are very helpful so I don't need to emphasise that. You also know that the side effects vary with each person so it's wrong to expect you'll definitely be badly hit by them. You will need to do the assertive patient thing again if the doc suggests an AI. Firstly, make him/her take you through the pluses and minuses of each of the three and genuinely discuss which of them would be best for you. Secondly, kick up the world's biggest fuss to make sure you get prescribed the patented version ie Femara, Arimidex or Aromasin. You, like me, would have read enough complaints on this forum to know that most people seem to find the patented version much easier than any of the generics. Personally, I find Arimidex perfectly OK - a little stiffness if I sit for too long eg in a movie or on a flight, but it goes within a minute or so of moving around. That's all.  Finally, I fear that you're in danger of talking yourself into horrid side effects. Nothing I can say about that, except beware and try not to. Maybe you could try talking yourself into it all being ok???  I'm really sorry if this sounds hard, I don't mean it that way. Think of it as tough love.

Everyone on here would say the waiting for results is the worst time, as your imagination can run away with you.  I don't think you need to worry that your local hospital wasn't sure what was going on. The main thing is that they referred you on to a specialist centre who do. I know Carolyn28 is having her treatment at the Royal Marsden and is very happy with them.  Even if you have a \"teeny tiny cancer\" that's good news in a weird way. It means you've caught it very early and it should therefore be curable. The survival rate for BC is over 90% overall and for early cancers even higher. Finding it is the first stage of recovery!

      "Content": "Hi Booth1986. Welcome aboard the roller coaster. I'm not surprised you're worrying - it's completely normal. The early stages of diagnosis are awful as you are thrust into a new scary world and don't understand much of what's being said to you. And that's before I mention the waiting, which gets to us all. I can assure you though that once you have a treatment plan in place and start grinding through it, things will settle down and become far more routine.  It's good news that your lymph nodes have tested negative. That means the cancer is most unlikely to have spread as the lymph nodes are the first place it spreads to. They will re-test when you have surgery but even if they do discover some cancer cells, it's still unlikely there's been any further spread. It's the role of the lymph nodes to catch any escaping cells so finding a few just means the nodes are doing their job.  ER negative means that your tumour isn't fed by oestrogen. The consequence of this is that you won't be offered tamoxifen or one of the other hormone suppressing drugs after your surgery as they won't be of any help. You are also more likely to be offered chemo as this is a more effective treatment for hormone negative cancer. They will also test your tumour to see whether it is HER2 positive or negative. If positive, there's a different drug regime again. All this testing helps the docs work out exactly which type of breast cancer you have and what will be the most effective treatment. While they do biopsies before surgery, the best information comes from testing the actual tumour after it's been removed.  When you see your surgeon after surgery, you should ask him/her to explain the results of the pathology testing - and keep asking till you completely understand. I'd suggest you ask for a copy of the pathology report too. You can also ask here as there are plenty of knowlegeable people who'll be able to assist you. In the meantime, kick back and wait for the surgery. There's no point in getting ahead of yourself.  Hope it all goes well. ",

Neulasta is in that category - to get approved you have to prove that you need it ie that you go neutropenic. In effect, it means you don't get it for the first treatment but do for later ones. I guess that's a cost saver in itself but I'm kinda ok with it, given that it costs over $2000 per shot.",

Just remember that the main thing is that your mum found the lump and is doing something about it. That's the first step in getting fixed up! It ma;y or may not be breast cancer - no one knows till the biopsy results are in, but what I do know is that spending the next weeks worrying about it will do absolutely nothing to change the diagnosis. Do try to park the worrying if you can. Distractions can be good and there's plenty of scope for that round christmas time. All the while bear in mind that breast cancer is very very treatable and the vast majority of people survive. In my city, 96% of people who have BC survive for at least 5 years. I think in most places it's over 90%.  Try to help your mum through this by not over-worrying, helping her with stuff, doing research for her, and contributing whatever you can to making it a really good Christmas for your family.

The Aromasin is to reduce the amount of oestrogen in your body as your kind of cancer needs oestrogen to grow. Unfortunately one of the consequences of reduced oestrogen is the potential for thinning of your bones or osteoporosis. The Zometa is to strengthen your bones. The good news is that Zometa and similar drugs have an anti-cancer effect, reducing the risk of bone mets.  None of us like having to take drugs (oh goody an extra pill today - I don't think so) but each step in the treatment is designed to reduce the risk of your cancer recurring or spreading.  Wishing you all the very best  Lynn xx",

It can be really hard when you're not part of the conversations with the doctors and are trying to piece everything together. Is there any chance your mum might let you go with her to appointments? It's pretty normal practice to do a head to pelvis CT scan when cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes. This is to check for spread of the cancer to other organs eg the lungs and liver. The bone scan would be to check for any spread to her bones. It's as much about ruling out any distant spread as anything. It's quite possible the earlier CT scan didn't cover a wide enough area. There's a handy table here that describes each grade and stage. Wishing you and your family all the best.",

      "Content": "Hi Islanikita I don't have big boobs (or one now at least) but I have had many of the same problems as you. When I had my first surgery (saved skin mastectomy with reconstruction) I was a size 24 and do you think the hospital had any of them - of course not. I was given one that was about 3 sizes too small round the back and about 2 cup sizes too big. It wasn't till I was able to get out to a specialist shop that I found anything that even fitted. And I can't say that they were in any way attractive! A long and sorry story which I won't bore you with resulted in my new boob filling with fluid (ultimately they got 3 litres out of it), the implant getting twisted and having fibres growing round it. In the end surgery was the only way to fix it but by then I was so over having a football on my chest that I just opted for a mastectomy to put an end to it all. I do not regret it at all.  Once that had healed and radio was finished, I had to do something about bras. I've dropped 2 dress sizes in that time so I thought it would be easy - how hard can it be to get a size 20C bra. Tried heaps but wasted my money. In the end, I decided to take the underwire out of my favourite moulded bras from before and do them up on the first row of hooks. They work well and look great. Lord knows what I'll do when they wear out. I have 4 but 2 are looking tatty! As for knitted knockers, I love them. It took me 4 goes to get it exactly right for me but now I've knitted 4 (one for each bra) plus a couple that I've filled with bath scrunchie stuff for swimming. The blessing is that I've now been able to match my other boob pretty exactly and also I can pin them inside my bra or swimmers so they never move. Highly recommend but you do have to fiddle a bit initially till you're satisfied with the look.  As far as the mastectomy goes, as ronstar said, I do have a positive view. In a funny way, it's actually made me feel more feminine, along the lines of \"you can take my hair, you can take my boob, but I'm still a woman\". I haven't hidden it from my husband or my friends - everyone's had a look, even my 16 year old nephew! (That's because he's about to have major surgery and was really worried about the scar, so I showed him that scars aren't that bad). Most of the time at home I don't wear a bra, never have, so I'm lopsided Lizzie and I don't care! I'll happily open the front door, talk to the cleaner and so on. I've even been down to the shops, but only in winter time and with a loose sweatshirt - I'm more embarrassed about how saggy my one boob is than I am about not having one on the other side. When I had radio I used to put the R1 cream on in the changeroom at the hospital and not wear a bra to go home. Didn't care as I figured everyone around had something to do with cancer so they'd be tolerant if they in fact noticed.  I guess everyone eventually finds their own solution. I hope you find yours soon. Best Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi all. My story is a bit of a tale of woe but I'm healthy so that's the main thing! I had a saved skin mastectomy with immediate implant in June 2015. Neither the surgeon nor the radio oncologist was concerned about having the implant before radiotherapy. I healed well and everything was rosy until about September, during chemo, when I got really sick with atrial fibrillation and PEs. Around that time I also started amassing fluid everywhere - ended up being about 10kg (almost 2 stone worth of fluid). Cutting a long story short, eventually I lost the fluid - everywhere except my reconstructed breast. By Christmas it was as if I was carrying a football on my chest, despite having been told it would eventually go and having lots of physio and binding.  I finished chemo end January and had my radio planning appointment but the fluid was so bad the radio oncologist was reluctant to go ahead. An ultrasound showed that the fluid, which by then they were calling a seroma, had septated ie grown lots of little fibres so the inside looked like a sponge rather than a balloon filled with water.  Also, the fibres had grown round the implant causing capsular contracture, ie squeezing and distorting it. Surgery to fix it was the only solution. By then I was so sick of the whole situation I opted for a full mastectomy and havent regretted it. The surgeon managed to drain 3 litres of fluid, which she said was \"spectacular\". I had a small seroma for a while but that's now healed and I've had my radio too. I may opt for a reconstruction at some point in the future but I'm reluctant at the moment as I don't fancy any further fluid problems! Apparently this whole situation is really rare - neither my surgeon nor my radio oncologist nor my medical oncologist had ever seen anything like it - so don't fear this happening. The only advice I'd give as a result of my experience is watch the fluid. You will be told that seromas eventually fix themselves but don't believe it - some do but many don't. Just keep on top of the situation. Cheers Lynn xx",

I stuck to the pregnancy diet - no shellfish, blue cheese, deli meats (except prepacked from the supermarket). We also had bottles of handwash everywhere and I was meticulous about using them. I also cleaned the kitchen bench each time with spray n wipe before preparing food. Importantly, I was given bicarb mouthwash and used it several times a day as the mouth is an open entry for infections. I had to give up my volunteer work at an aged care facility as my onco was very concerned about antibiotic resistant bacteria but that was the only real sacrifice.  Get a digital thermometer if you don't already have one and take your temp regularly. This will enable you to take early action if your temp rises. Lynn xx",

The worst part of this whole journey is the early bit where you are bombarded with tests, words you don't understand and appointment after appointment. Eventually it all settles into a rhythm and before you know it, you're coping.  It is gruelling, sometimes painful and sometimes scary but most of all it's do-able. Everyone's journey is different but we've all had good bits and bad bits. You'll find great people on this site who are happy to help/chat and who have been through the same thing. I've found it invaluable.  I second the advice already given - try to get them to give you a portacath or at least a PICC or Hickman line before you start chemo. While the portacath is the gold medal winner, they are all better than having chemo through cannulas. Make sure to be kind to yourself - you don't have to be a martyr. Family and friends will want to help - let them! Welcome to the club none of us wanted to join and I hope you're feeling calmer about it all soon. Best wishes  Lynn",

Apart from anything else, having some company can make it all feel not as overwhelming.  As others have said, the ban on lifting is the most important and yet probably the hardest if you live alone. I was told to lift no more than 3kg (7lbs) for 3 weeks, nor to do any activity that required heavy duty use of my arm eg digging, vacuuming. I would say that shopping and putting the rubbish out are the two most difficult tasks. Shopping's ok if you only have one bagful, that you can carry with the other arm but I had to rely on my husband to put out the bins (still do lol). Also, for the first few days she won't have much energy, so perhaps a few meals cooked for her? In addition, the hospital I was in won't let people go home as early if there's no one there. She might be kept in a bit longer, or is it possible you could stay over one or two nights? You haven't mentioned follow up treatment but if she has to have chemo or radiotherapy, then lifts to and from the hospital will be appreciated, even if it's only sometimes.  Wishing your aunt all the best. ",

He said that recurrence or mets are never without symptoms - lump, unusual pain, breathlessness, headaches and so on so the most important thing to do is to know your body and be alert to any changes.

The reason I ask is that not everyone loses their hair with T, but hair loss is virtually guaranteed with AC.  Don't worry, it doesn't all just drop off, like taking off a hat. You may notice some on your pillow, as mentioned, or that your hairbrush has more hair than usual. Another key sign is that your hair starts hurting, rather like a too-tight ponytail. That can become unbearable and that's when most people shave their hair off.  I had my AC first and started losing my hair about a week in. As soon as that happened, hubby and I sat down with a bottle of champagne while he shaved me. That was recommended by my GP lol.  Hope you're not finding the chemo too awful.",

My onco wouldn't let me have it with no steroids - he thinks it's important protection against the possible allergic reaction. He did however cut my dose right back to the minimum (4mg) when I think the normal dose is up to 20mg - and I don't have any dex tablets after the infusion. I've been fine on that regime. There are a couple of other possibilities. The cancer research UK site suggests abraxane instead as you don't need the steroid. It's usually only used for metastatic BC though. There's also an article from the US NIH which seems to suggest that you can discontinue pre-meds after a couple of rounds if you don't get the allergic reaction.  I suggest you do a bit of research and go back to your onco with questions. ",

      "Content": "Hi Lamg There are basically two taxanes - taxotere (or docetaxel) which is normally every 3 weeks with 3 or 4 treatments, and Taxol (or paclitaxel) which is weekly for 12 weeks. The weekly regimen is a lower dose and usually easier as far as side effects go, and some people who really struggle on docetaxel are swapped to the weekly paclitaxel. It sounds to me like you're having the docetaxel but with accelerated treatment - fortnightly instead of 3 weekly. That's a tough regimen. May I suggest that you have  full discussion with your oncologist next time you see him or talk to himso you're quite clear on what is being given to you. You might also want to ask why fortnightly and whether you should switch to paclitaxel weekly.  It sounds like you didn't do too badly on the first lot - was that EC or its cousin AC? My purely speculative observation is that a lot of people who do ok on EC find T tough and vice versa.  Wishing you all the best",

      "Content": "Hi Sacha. Sorry to hear you have to have a mastectomy. Am I reading your post right that it's both breasts? I had a left mastectomy with implant in June 2015. I gained a lovely pert boob, alas no nipple. The surgeon had to take out my lymph nodes as well but she went in through the cut on the underside of my breast so I had one single scar under the breast, close to the chest wall. Healing for me was really fast. I had the wound covered with plastic for 10 days and when I peeled that off, most of the scab came off too. If I recall correctly, the rest of the scab was gone in a week. I was given arm exercises the day after surgery and did them religiously to recover full movement in my arm and shoulder. No pain at all.  As it happened I was very ill during chemo and put on about 10kg of fluid, which eventually went from everywhere except my new boob. This meant eventually that I had to have the implant removed and I decided not to go for another one, thinking that I'm vulnerable to fluid problems. However, don't let that put you off - what happened to me is very rare.  I don't know if your surgeon has mentioned it but radiotherapy can be problematic with implants. Firstly, getting the angles right is more difficult as there's a silicon blob in the way. Secondly, people occasionally get what's called capsular contracture, where fibres grow round the implant, squeezing and distorting it, as well as causing pain. The only solution is to replace the implant. I'm not certain but I think that you can have temporary implants, some of which can be left permanently if all is ok, or else they're replaced later with permanent implants. May I suggest that you make sure that your surgeon fully explains all this, including all the risks and benefits.  Hope it all goes well for you.",

      "Content": "Hi JJ I've just re-read this thread and thought I'd share my rehab with you. 6 months ago I was in hospital for a month, including 2 weeks in the ICU. My onco wanted me to do in-patient rehab as the majority of people over 60 never fully recover from a stint in ICU. However, I waited for a week for a place in a private hospital and in the end couldn't stand being in the cancer ward any longer so I went home. At that time I could just about walk 20 metres, as long as there was a hand railing, and couldn't climb stairs. I had to use a wheelchair to get to the car to go home and then be helped by my husband into the house. There was an 18 week wait for out patient rehab so I decided to do my own.  I religiously did the exercises given to me by the physio at the hospital and also bought an exercise bike. When I first started I could only do one minute on the easiest setting. I have stuck at it and now do 20 mins daily with interval training, including a bit at the toughest level. A cycling coach whom I know said it's not necessary to do more than 20 mins as long as you do intervals.  Six months later ... I'm fitter than I've ever been, I can walk longer than most of my friends (except the exercise nut) and feel better than I have in 15 years. It sort of crept up on me and I still can't really believe it. But it is great. If you can buy, borrow or dig out of the garage an exercise bike I'd highly recommend it.  With very best wishes for a complete recovery. Lynn xx",

For example, when they do your bloods or BP they could easily do a glucose test as well.  I had terrible problems with glucose levels during chemo. In fact, the endocrinologist is of the opinion that I was tipped into diabetes ie steroid-induced diabetes. This was discovered at the end of my AC chemo when I had heart problems (atrial fibrillation) and clots in my lungs too. Apparently it was all linked. When I was much improved and resumed chemo with T, I asked if I could have it without any steroids. My onco was very reluctant because of the possible allergic effects of T. However he did agree to reduce the dose to the bare minimum so I just had 8mg dexmethasone infused just prior to the T and no before or after tablets. Even so my BGL went up from an ok 6 or 7 to around 15 or 16 and took 48 hours to come down.  The moral of this story is that you need to talk to your onco about the dose of steroids you're being given. If you're not having too much nausea, they should be able to cut them back quite considerably.  As for food, I didn't want to eat much at all and I confess I didn't pay much attention to blood sugar levels at that time. I lived on scrambled eggs, cherry tomatoes, grapes, fresh orange juice and tomato soup. They were the only things I could bear to put in my mouth.  Wishing you all the best.",

Also I tried really hard to be nice to him (this sprang from a comment he made - \"you're lovely to your friends but horrible to me\"). I wasn't dishonest though and there were times when I had to tell him to back off or shut up eg when he'd carry on about possible consequences - usually I'd put it in terms of him making a difficult journey more difficult for me. The plus side is that I have absolutely no doubt that he really cares and our relationship has remained rock solid - better than before if that's possible. Best of luck Lynn",

Instead my hubby, brother and mother worried themselves stupid. What they didn't know (but I did) was that I'd already had a CT scan of the area (ordered by my surgeon months beforehand) and it was found to be only calcification. If only they'd mentioned it to me ... So anyway I had an MRI and guess what - it was just calcification! Carolyn28 Lucky you going to Thailand - Koh Samui is one of my very favourite places. Bangkok is an experience too - great fun but noisy and smelly and hard to get round. If you haven't already booked your hotel there, try to get somewhere near the river as the river boats and taxis make life a lot easier. We like to stay at the Shangri-La, which is not only a fabbo hotel by the river but is also right near a monorail station and within walking distance of Silom Rd, one of the good shopping areas.

For example, when they do your bloods or BP they could easily do a glucose test as well.  I had terrible problems with glucose levels during chemo. In fact, the endocrinologist is of the opinion that I was tipped into diabetes ie steroid-induced diabetes. This was discovered at the end of my AC chemo when I had heart problems (atrial fibrillation) and clots in my lungs too. Apparently it was all linked. When I was much improved and resumed chemo with T, I asked if I could have it without any steroids. My onco was very reluctant because of the possible allergic effects of T. However he did agree to reduce the dose to the bare minimum so I just had 8mg dexmethasone infused just prior to the T and no before or after tablets. Even so my BGL went up from an ok 6 or 7 to around 15 or 16 and took 48 hours to come down.  The moral of this story is that you need to talk to your onco about the dose of steroids you're being given. If you're not having too much nausea, they should be able to cut them back quite considerably.  As for food, I didn't want to eat much at all and I confess I didn't pay much attention to blood sugar levels at that time. I lived on scrambled eggs, cherry tomatoes, grapes, fresh orange juice and tomato soup. They were the only things I could bear to put in my mouth.  Wishing you all the best.",

One I think everyone who's had a mastectomy asks (or suffers from) at some point.  I refuse to wear a silicon prosthesis for several reasons - they cost about $400 here in Australia and there are no freebies, although you can get some contribution towards the cost through your private health insurance. Secondly it means you have to wear a pocketed bra or else you run the risk of the chicken fillet popping out to say hello. I'm told they feel really hot and uncomfortable in Australian summers too.  Anyway, I wear a knitted knocker - very light and comfortable and I can safety pin it to my bra so there are no surprise appearances. This means you can wear any bra. I've been through many many bras since my mastectomy and never really found a perfect one. In fact, my most preferred bras are ones I had before surgery that I have removed the underwire from. Don't know what I'll do when they wear out.  As far as reconstruction goes, my surgeon said she wouldn't do anything until at least 12 months after finishing radio. She's happy to do it after that. However, I don't want a reconstruction as I've had lots of problems with fluid and I don't want more.  I agree that more pretty bras should be available but I wonder about the size of the market for them as most people seem to have lumpectomies or reconstructions now.

Only nail hardener kept them together but then sometimes the top would just snap off. Most have grown out now but my thumbs are still very flaky and I think they've got about another 5mm to grow. I've still got a couple of Beau's lines on them. Also on one index finger, the nail bed has retreated and I may still lose that nail.  My regrowing toenail is only halfway up so far. So yep it could still be chemo but if your nails were ok and then started being not ok, it may not be.

There was a lot of talk between the technicians, the radio oncology consultant and the radiotherapy registrar about how to deal with this massive boob. They took loads of measurements for making a special bolus (covering that brings the radiation beam target closer to the surface of the skin). They also made a back mould so I would be lying in an odd position that was easier to irradiate. And of course I had the scan and tatts. In the end the consultant decided she wasn't happy with the idea of irradiating the football and referred me back to my surgeon.  After a mastectomy, I had another much more straightforward planning appointment - measurements, scan, more tatts.  The only reason I've mentioned all this is that some radio oncologists get very thingy about doing radiotherapy when you've got an implant. This is for two reasons - firstly it makes getting the positioning of the beams harder and secondly radio can damage the implant. Many people with implants have had successful radio though so don't get too concerned. ",

I looked after them all through chemo, including changing their litter trays once a week and emptying the poo out daily.

Apart from that I had bottles of alcohol wash around the house and cleaned my hands with that frequently. No infection problems at all.  As for being by yourself ... I completely understand as I'm a bit of a loner. However, there were times when I really needed help. I was quite ill with side effects and very weak and fatigued. Changing the bed was beyond me as was any kind of heavy vacuuming. At times I wasn't fit to drive. I am blessed to have a supportive husband and some very good friends who all got me through it.  Generally I found that people really want to help but often aren't sure how to. I'd suggest letting one or two friends be part of your journey and then you'll at least have someone to turn to if needed. Wishing you all the best. Lynn xx",

It sounds like you've been doing really well.  I presume the breast consultant has ruled out a recurrence?  I haven't had this sort of problem as I had a full mastectomy no reconstruction but sounds like you need to do something about it. Has your surgeon given you any info about the likely success of going down the liposuction route? Also, has he/she suggested any alternatives? All I can really say is don't agree to anything you're not comfortable with and do explore all the options.  Wishing you all the best.",

I did swap taking the pill in the evening for taking it in the morning. The night sweats immediately disappeared. The flushes during the day gradually reduced and after about 8 months - nothing. So hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel for you.  I know you don't want to take any more drugs, so I'm going to suggest another drug hahahaha. Feel free to ignore me, cheerfully or otherwise. However, a lot of people with bad menopausal symptoms think that the anti-depressant venlafaxine is very helpful for relieving the symptoms. A friend of mine had it while menopausal. Then she got breast cancer and asked her onco if she should stop it. He said definitely no as it would help with the flushes from Arimidex. Might be worth asking about ... Friday is your non-work day isn't it? Do try to have a nap this afternoon. Makes the world of difference. Big hugs",

I've been on Arimidex now for nearly 2 years and don't have much trouble at all - just a little stiffness if I sit for too long. I confess I've gained a bit of weight but I don't know if that's the Arimidex, me being a pig or just regaining some of the 40kg (88 pounds) I lost during chemo. I've been told it's almost unavoidable to regain some of the weight. I do get very hungry though.  I do hope you find a way to settle things down as it can be really debilitating.  Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Hi BluesJK. Welcome to the forum. Posting in the chemo club is fine but if you want to start a new post, all you have to do is join the breast group and then you'll get a start new thread option on the right hand side. Most if not all of the people reading the chemo club thread will have decided to go for chemo. You might get a more balanced perspective if you started a new thread on the specific topic. To chemo or not to chemo is a big decision, especially given your age and potential compromise of fertility. I was in the 'throw everything at it' group but I understand why you might be reluctant. A bit of searching through the older threads in this group will find you lots of discussions about whether or not to have chemo - have a read as something might jump out at you that helps you make the decision.  I have to say that 41 on the oncotype test seems very high to me. I think you'll find that around 20 or 25 is usually the area where there's a decision to be made and higher than that most oncologists would definitely be recommending chemo. Mind you that's only my impression from reading threads here, as not having chemo wasn't an option for me as the cancer I had was HER2+. A 15% risk reduction seems pretty high to me too. I personally couldn't live with that level of risk although as I said, I'd pretty much do or take anything to avoid a recurrence. Hopefully someone will come along with the opposite viewpoint to me. I know there are plenty! Ruby Rose - It does seem unusual to have only 18 weeks worth of Herceptin. I don't recall anyone else only having that, other than toxophilite (whose treatment was stopped because of heart issues) but I do know that when Herceptin first came on the market, people in New Zealand only got 9 doses because the government couldn't afford to subsidise the full year's worth. I had atrial fibrillation during chemo but no problems at all with herceptin. I was closely monitored though, with a visit to the cardiologist every 3 months as well as a finger tip heart monitor to check every day. ",

Mine went down a little - from high 60s to high 50s if I remember correctly - but not enough to cause problems. It was back to high 60s within 3 months of finishing H.  Your heart will be monitored but just make sure that if there are any signs of problems, you insist on a cardiology consult. ",

But what I really wanted to mention is that I have a Protein C deficiency, discovered when I had pulmonary embolisms during chemo. I'm on warfarin for the rest of my life. I asked about one of the more modern blood thinners but the specialist said that warfarin gives better control long term. The down side is that I have to have my blood tested once a month. The up side is that warfarin is reversible so if I were, say in a car accident, they could make my blood clot with a shot of Vitamin K. The other up  side is that I can't eat too many green vegetables - no more broccoli for me lol.  Also, on the question of port removal or not, I had a port but I had mine for about 18 months as I received my Herceptin by infusion (by injection wasn't available when I started and I was given a choice when injections came in). Afterwards I was given a choice of leaving it there or having it removed. I chose removal, mainly as they have to be flushed every 6-8 weeks. That would have meant a trip to the chemo unit every couple of months and I thought that would mean I'd never get away from being a patient. Not good psychologically.  All the best for the rest of your treatment.",

Portacaths are used quite routinely here for anyone having more than a couple of chemo treatments.  I had mine inserted privately (not odd as I had my chemo at the same private hospital) and none of the nurses had any trouble. However, at one point I was very ill and was admitted to the tertiary public hospital. For some reason, they couldn't access my port - even the supposed port guru had several tries but couldn't get into it. I was also told at one point that all ports will take but only some will give - in other words it can be tricky to get blood from them. My take out from all of this is that ports, although they seem simple (just a drum that you poke a needle into), are in fact a dark art. I know you have to be trained but even then it's not easy. I think that's why some places avoid them. ",

      "Content": "Hi Katiepie Once upon a time I was a big drinker and I continued to drink quite a lot during my first lot of chemo (AC). However, I was hospitalised at the end of that for a month. That was an enforced break from alcohol. I went on to lifetime warfarin and was warned very severely about not drinking more than one glass of wine. Decided that none would be easier than one. That was in September 2015. Since then I've had 2 alcoholic desserts, one with sauternes jelly and the other with a calvados drizzle. That's it. And, while I acknowledge that I may have a drink now and then, I simply don't miss it at all. I think it was definitely easier having the enforced break in hospital though.  As for getting fit, I had to do self directed rehab when I got out of hospital (long story). I bought myself an exercise bike (or stationary bike at the gym types seem to call them these days) and gradually built up to 20 mins with intervals. A cycling coach I know told me that's enough for general fitness, as long as you do the intervals. I hate it still but do manage 5 times a week. The alternative was walking, but I hate that even more lol. As a friend of mine says, why walk when you've got a perfectly good car. But as a total non-exerciser for my entire life, I can assure you that a little bit of exercise will definitely help with the fatigue and WILL make you feel better. No need to go overboard. ",

      "Content": "Hi candytop What a dilemma and how irritating to have this happen at the same time. You poor thing. I think I tend to agree with Crystaljuju - lumpectomy, teeth, chemo. The main reason I think that is because bad teeth or gums can easily let germs in and are often the source of infection when your immune system is compromised by chemo. And infections are something you really will need to avoid if possible. I say lumpectomy before teeth so you can get rid of the little monster asap. Have they told you you're definitely to have chemo? It seems that, unlike here in Australia, not everyone is slated for chemo - depends on the risk of recurrence, type of cancer, whether it's spread to your lymph nodes and so on.  Despite what we all say, the main thing is that you should be guided by your oncologist. You need to be an assertive patient and press him/her until you get a full and satisfactory answer.  Wishing you all the best Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Wow 2-3 months - that seems an extraordinary period of time to have to go without teeth! Is it just delays in service or do they want your gum to heal fully before fitting for new dentures. I couldn't have tolerated that kind of wait. Mind you the system's a bit different here in Australia - I haven't been to a dentist since I got the full dentures. I go directly to a dental technician ie the guy that makes and repairs them. He delivers new dentures in less than a week from the first moulds and repairs within 2 hours and is cheaper too lol. At least it will be winter in the UK - you can wear a woolly hat and scarf over your mouth and hide pretty well I should think. And of course it's perfect time of the year for soups and mashed potato. I found during chemo (when I had very little appetite) that tomato soup, fresh OJ and scrambled egg were among the very few foods I could actually get down. I lived on them plus cherry tomatoes and grapes for the entire period. I can't say I worried that much about nutrition as eating anything was a struggle - I relied on the eggs lol.  Hopefully you'll find enough soft foods that you can stand. Just think how great the first real meal will be after it's all over! Good luck with it all Lynn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Wink Welcome to the forum. It must be very tough for you worrying about your kids while going through treatment but always bear in mind that over 90% of people survive breast cancer. In some parts of Australia, the survival rate is even higher. For example, in Canberra where I live, it's hovering around 96%, which is pretty amazing really. Whereabouts are you?  I had AC chemo followed by T but I had paclitaxel, which is 12 weekly doses, rather than docetaxel, which is 3 or 4 doses, 3 weeks apart. The A stands for doxorubicin (aka adriamyacin, which is where the A comes from). It's a close cousin to epirubicin, which is much more common in the UK. Australia seems to favour doxorubicin for some reason - I don't know of anyone here who has had epirubicin.  I had a hard time with the AC but found the T part reasonably easy. For some people it's the other way round and I have a good friend who sailed through both with very few side effects. You won't really know how difficult it will be until you get started.  The main advice I'd give you right now is to accept help when it's offered and make sure you have some back up for looking after your kids if you feel cr*p. Knowing they're ok will take the pressure off you if all you want is a doona day. Apart from that, drink loads of water - I was told to drink 3 litres in the 24 hours following chemo and 2 litres every other day - and try to get some gentle exercise. It really does help.  Don't forget we're here if you want to ask any questions or just need to rant about anything. I hope it goes well for you and your side effects are mild.",

That just shows how important it is for all of us to be on top of what's happening.  Can biopsies be wrong? I'd imagine any procedure can be wrong, but the error rate would be pretty low. However, a biopsy is taking a sample of tissue and then the pathologist looks at the cells in that sample. It is possible for suspicious areas to be partly ok and partly cancerous. The main thing though is that your surgeon is on to it and that means they can treat both lumps if the second does turn out to be cancerous.
