I thought tjis was a complete no no ??? Just feeling ovewhelmed and bloomin frightened xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie , Cant lie it hurt quite a bit the Fec being pushed through yesterday. Horrible. But its done..and yes and half way through. Dont feel too bad today...a bit nauseous and tired. Herceptin and Taxotare next time..... Yes they were suspicious about lymph nodes after my first tumour biopsies. They then took further biopsies and found it in lymph nodes. 9 removed one cancerous and Her2 positive. The haematoema I got day after surgery. I had 2 drains in and my boob blew up like Pamela Anderson..lol..Had to go staight back into surgery where they drained it and redid drains. But after I got home the saga continued. I was going upto the breast unit a couple of times a week while they manually squeezed and massaged the haematoema as Still dead blod in there. Then had it asperated with a needle...that hurt...but still no joy. This went on for 6 weeks. Then at home one evening it burst...I thought my neice had brought something in on her shoe...the smell was horrendous. I looked down and was wet through with this gunk. Needless to say I was scared..rang 101 and they made app for me to go to A and E. All ok as the majority of stuff all gone. But this made my wound delay in healing so hence the delay in chemo. All our journeys are different....but does help so much to talk to each other. So sorry about the sepsis...its a nightmare...never know what's coming.... Love n hugs Marie Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie , Wowsers you've been through it havnt you. Sending you lots of love. I had a double lumpectomy and all lymph nodes removed on right side in August. Then had a haematoema....and complications from there..so chemo had to be delayed a couple of times.  Still im on my way now and 3rd fec at 12.today. Thanks for the heads up on the T will bear that in mind. So you suck on the ice during the chemo ? It must be really nasty stuff..... I will keep in touch if that is ok...thanks again it is a real comfort to know there are others going through this... Wish me luck Marie Xxx",
