      "Content": "I too have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I am 42 and had a wide local excision and full clearance of the lymph nodes 2 weeks ago. I am going to have approx 5 months of chemo, 3 weeks of radio and take the drug tamoxifen for 5 years. My sister who is 40 had a maesectomy and full clearance of lymph nodes 4 weeks ago. She is due to start chemo, followed by radio and will be taking the herceptin drug. She was told that because of this treatment she cannot have a reconstruction for at least 12 to 18 months, which is why I am puzzled that you have been told you will be able to have a reconstruction the same time. i was also told that when they removed the lump and if the lymph nodes were clear I would have to have 3 weeks of radio, by your comment you were told different. From what I understand if the lump is quite big as yours is then a maesectomy is the only option because of the amount of breast which will be left As for nothing showing up on the mammogram, my cancer never showed up, they thought it was a cyst and because it felt too deep to drain they investigated further., I am confused by how much time I have to have off work. Consultant told be 8 - 9 months, Oncologist said around 7 - 8 months and the breast nurse said that as I work local in an office I should be able to work through chemo, but everyone is different and it depends on how I react. ANY SUGGESTIONS ON THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL SO I CAN TELL MY EMPLOYERS SOMETHING",

      "Content": "I think this answers my previous query about my sister having reconstruction just in case she has a problem with the treatment as she was in hospital with a lady who had maesectomy and reconstruction straight away but she didn't need radiotherapy",
