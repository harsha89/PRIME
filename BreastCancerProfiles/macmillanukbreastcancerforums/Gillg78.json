    "Content": "Hello lovely, I just read a post from Alison on our fb site and thought I would pop on and say hello. i haven't been in this situation but was dx with both primary and secondary when my baby was 4 months old. there is a Facebook page for younger women with breast cancer. It's called YBCN. Type that into your search and send a message explaining your situation and ask to be added to the secret forums. You will receive lots of help and guidance from the woman there. Head up lovely. Xxx    ",
