    "Content": "Hello  My hair started coming out after my first EC chemo. I was very concerned about losing it when I was told that I was going to have Chemo, but everything was put in to perspective when I was neutropenic and had to spend 2 days in hospital! Strangely that was when my hair started coming out in handfuls! When  got home I chopped it and then shaved it myself. I have a selection of wigs and loads of hats and scarfs, I actually quite like my bald head but I do tend to cover it more so that I look \"normal\" for the sake of the children and others! So for me to shave it off was the right thing to do! Good luck!",
