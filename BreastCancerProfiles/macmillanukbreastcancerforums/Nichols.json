      "Content": "Hello, My wife is starting her first chemo this thursday for Breast cancer & secondary Liver/Bone cancer. A small family gathering has been organised tomorrow in her honour. Only snag is 1 of the children invited has a cold. We are taking our 2 year old twins. I realise this may be a stupid question but is there any danger of the chemo being delayed or made worse if my wife catches the cold. Any advice greatly appreciated. Paul.",
