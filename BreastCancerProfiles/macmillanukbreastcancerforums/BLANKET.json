      "Content": "Hi Susie et al,   I never minded being bald as I'd had too many bad hair days to care, but the beard was my absolute worst mare!  I tried creams but they burned my face, so out comes the epilator every week.  I will not tolerate a beard!   Also I waited for cancer to come back & thought that if I could fight it again then that would be it, I'd then be able to move on with my life.  It did, & nothing can prepare you for a 2nd dose as I thought it had come back to get me.  It was bladder cancer this time & I've had quite a few op's but I'm fine, & I no longer worry, well only before an op.  In fact I was more worried when they told me last time that there was nothing there, I was convinced that they hadn't looked properly :-/   I was on Tamoxifen for almost 5 years, I've been off it for just over a year &  I'm just beginning to feel like not killing people :-o. It can bring you down, I tried Arimidex too but it had the same effect.  Perhaps looking back I shouldn't have took it for that long, but I thought it was everyone else, not me.     Take care all, you'll get there in the end x  ",

      "Content": "Hi mistyblue, I don't think you can take anything in other than the fact that you have breast cancer, it's just the way it is.  Do you have someone to go with you to appointments?  Then if you miss anything or everything (like I used to) then other person can tell you about it later.  My Onco, used to write everything down as he was talking to me & then send me home with the notes, so even if I didn't get it at the time (I never did), I could try & work it out later.  Write a list of questions too if you want to know anything as your mind will go blank. I was about the same size as you too & worried about my weight, but breast cancer (or maybe the foods I ate whilst having it) made me gain weight for the first time in my life!  Previously I had IBS & couldn't eat chocolate, crisps, chips, .... but I could after chemo as the IBS seemed to disappear for a short while.  So it's not all bad news! Shall we eat cake together now, fancy a chocolate muffin? Take care x",

      "Content": "Hi Fadima, I was diagnosed in 2009, had chemo, radio, herceptin,  tamoxifen on & off twice,  arimidex on & off twice.   I remember hearing someone say that they couldn't wait to get back to normal, but I knew then, after that steamroller that I'd never be normal again - not that I ever was.  I imagined I'd be quite joyful after all that, but I too waited for it to come back, even wished it would then I'd fight it again & only then could I settle down with my life.  I'm a lot better since I've been off the tamoxifen & arimidex as now I know that they really did bring me down.  However, I still get upset & angry, I put this down to the treatment I had.   The highs are oh so high & the lows are, well you know how it is.  You'll get there in the end x",
