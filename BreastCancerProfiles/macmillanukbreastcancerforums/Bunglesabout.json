      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I so wish my experience of Taxotere was the same as yours. I struggled with the FEC and was glad to have my first Tax last week.  the first two days were great. I felt fine, pretty good actually and started feeling fairly optomistic that I had got lucky with this drug. Then 3 days in I got the most unbelieveable pain in my legs and feet! I tried paracetemol and Ibobrufen as advised by the Onc nurses, but this didnt even touch the pain.  It got so bad in my feet that I had difficulty walking at the weekend.  After 3 nights of no sleep and never ending pins and needles I contacted my GP and got stronger meds.  I'm finally starting to get some relief nearly a week later, but lord the last few days have been hard! I also had the sore mouth and throat and the tingling in my finger nails, which is scary as I really dont want t lose my nails!  Despite all this though, I still will say that the Tax is better than the FEC (for me) as I hated the nasuea, the severe constiapation and the horrible sensation in my stomach.with FEC  Just got to be better prepared for the next cycle and take the pain meds before I start to feel anything.  Plus I made things worse this time by not seeking help with the pain earlier.  I didn't want to take loads of meds, as I have never liked taking pills and I worried how they would interact with the chemo, but I truly had no choice in the end, as it was so strong. This was a hard lesson to learn for me and the fact that there was a delayed reaction, when I felt rough with the FEC immediately defintely caught me by surprise, but each cycle brings you closer to the finish line, so got to keep on trucking. I would advise anyone who starts getting niggling pains after the Tax not to ignore them though and get straight on the pain meds. I wish I had done it sooner and will defintely do so after my next dose.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I need some advice about seromas and was hoping you could help. I had WLE and full node clearance surgery 17 days ago. After 8 days I developed a very large seroma under my arm which my BC nurse aspirated, but she warned me that it would come back and as it had been so large (almost a pint of fluid) she wanted to see me again today to re-check it and if necessary confer with a doctor.  Unfortunately my father in law was taken seriously ill on Wednesday and I am currently in Chichester with my partner. As expected my seroma came right back up and I rang my BC nurse who told me I could get help at the local A&E if could not get back home to see her. I went there yesterday evening as my seroma was once again massive and stretching the edges of my node scar. I cannot have my arm hang down in comfort and cannot sleep and due to it's size did think I could get some help, but the doctor I saw was really unpleasant. He told me that he would not aspirate as the risk of infection was so high and that as this seroma would last at least 3 months I would just have to get used to it. I was quite shocked at his attitude and said that there must be something that can be done, even if it involved further surgery back home, as I couldn't wander around with my hand on my hip (my arm will not hang down properly due to the size of my seroma) for 3 months. He told me that unless I was in agony and screaming in pain he would not aspirate or recommend anything else and I should just get on with it. I was stunned when he said this (in front of nurses) and asked if that was the norm in this hospital; that you had to be in severe pain before anyone would act? At this point he then changed his tune and offered to aspirate me as long as I knew the risk of infection, but by this point I didn't like or trust him with my treatment and so refused. At the earliest opportunity I will return home and see if I can see my own BC nurse instead.  My question really is how often do Infections occur?  He made it seem like they happened all the time and that they caused huge complications, so anyone with a seroma should just accept the pain/discomfort and suck it up. I know about the risks as they were explained to me by my BC nurse, but I did expect that there could be something done to minimise the problem, even if it just reduced the size of my seroma to one that is bearable so that I can use my arm. Other ladies on this site and others have said that they had seromas aspirated 3-4 times without issue. Prior to my cancer treatment I never went to the doctors and can count on one hand the number of visits over a 30 year period, but all the health care personnel I have met over the last 5 months have been lovely with the exception of him. Suffice to say I will not be returning to St Richards A&E in Chichester any time soon!   ",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky, thank you for the advice about cooling the area. I will definitely try this.  I returned home yesterday and was able to contact the BC unit. They advised me to ring the SAU (surgery assessment unit) if I couldn't get home in time to see a BC nurse, which is what I did this morning. They told me to come in and took one look and aspirated it. (thank god!) The relief was amazing and they were nice and understanding about it. It's a shame that I couldn't get a similar response in Chichester, but you are probably right in that they may have had limited experience with seromas and how to deal with them. When I was waiting in the reception area, I'm fairly sure the nurses were looking it up at their PC's! (You've got to love Google!!). Plus I saw a female doctor briefly before the unpleasant one and she wanted to know what the 'WLE' stood for, from the notes a nurse took to pre-assess me. It didn't fill me with confidence that she didn't know this was a lumpectomy!  I got a lot more help and info today, so feel better prepared for the coming weeks, but I am still quite angry with the doctor in Chichester and his unwillingness to help me despite seeing the size of my seroma and the pain I was in.   Bungle   ",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, thank you for the response. I don't think this doctor would be willing to aspirate even 100ml as it was the insertion of the needle that he objected to.  I know there are risks with any procedure, but as the needles are sterile, if the doctor/nurse maintains this throughout the treatment this must reduce the risk, but he wouldn't consider it.  What frustrates me is that my first seroma took 4 days to come up and get unbearable. This one not even 3 days and this morning it is even tighter on my scar and now really firm. Just got to hang on till I get home and can see one of my nurses, but the BH weekend will probably delay this. :-(",

      "Content": "Hi Weeble, it was my understanding too that your seroma could be aspirated until it was a manageable size. And I was informed about the infection risk. To be honest, when my first one came up I had the full intention to leave it alone, as I do prefer trying to let your own body sort it out. But once my scar got really tight I became worried that it would tear, which is why I finally had the aspiration.  I was just surprised how uncaring and inflexible he was, which is a shame as the nurse I initially saw at St Richards was lovely. I just was hoping to get some feedback from someone who may have got an infection via aspiration as he made it sound like it was highly dangerous and hard to treat. Bungle  ",
