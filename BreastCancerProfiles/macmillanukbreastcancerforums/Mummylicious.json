    "Content": "I am on this trial and am coping well. I have intermittent  tummy pains which are difficult and found I was allergic to Buscopan which had been prescribed to help with the pain. But I can cope. Chemo makes you hard ! The doctor and trial nurse keep talking about a dose reduction which I\u2019m reluctant to adopt as I prefer the full blast ! So we are seeing how I go. I feel comforted knowing I get regular scans, a 2 weekly examination from a doctor plus the potential of reduced recurrence rates from this drug already trialed positively on secondary cancer patients, therefore this trial is a no brainer for me. If recurrence does occur I would hope with all this extra care it would be picked up early and I\u2019m prepared to suffer a bit for that benefit.  Well worth consideration as opposed to the usual standards of a bi annual mammogram! The trickiest thing is getting blood out of my arm every fortnight, 4 hours it took at my last visit! ",
