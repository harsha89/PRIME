    "Content": "I came off Citalopram last year and went through hell and back...... 20mg every other day for a fortnight and then 10 mg for another fortnight and then GP stopped them.  I originally went on them back in 2000 due to stress and hair loss and guess what one of the side effects of it is......  hair loss!!! Went through the hell of withdrawal and just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up also the pain of the breast lump found and waited 3 months to be seen.  Did some online research you should wean yourself off these tablets over a long period of time...... have lost faith in doctors all together... sorry you are going through this.",
