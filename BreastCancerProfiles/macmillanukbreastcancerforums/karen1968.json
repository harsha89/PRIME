    "Content": "HI SANDMOUSE I AM CURRENTLY USING ZOLADEX (INJECTIONS INTO TUMMY ) . I TOO HAVE HAD HOT FLUSHES , SLEEPLESS NIGHTS  I THINK THEY ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG AS IT PUTS YOU INTO EARLY MENOPAUSE WHICH IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME ( I AM 43 YRS OLD ). SO IF YOU CAN PUT UP WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS THEY WILL GET BETTER , MY GP TOLD ME THAT NORMALLY THEY ONLY HAVE YOU ON IT FOR 6MONTHS AT A TIME  :)) .  I AM NOT USING TAMOXIFEN BUT HAVE DONE 5YRS AGO AND HAD NO PROBS WITH THAT .    ",
