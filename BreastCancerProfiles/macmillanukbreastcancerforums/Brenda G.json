Never mind how uncomfortable it is!!! especially when you sleep (or try to) on that side.  Third time lucky, I hope, when I have drained nxt Tues. Thanks for your kind comments & best wishes.

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm Brenda. I'm not completely new to the site but this is the first time I have wrote anything. I had a right sided mastectomy in January this year, following a recurrence of Breast Cancer 10 years after my 1st diagnosis. My problem at the mo is that I have quite a large seroma, where my breast once was. I think it is a seroma anyway, I've never actually been told, I am just going on what I have read on here, plus I have had it drained twice. I am just a bit (well a lot really) worried about it as it is as hard as a stone, whereas it was quite soft and 'woosshy' at first. It is also painful at times and very uncomfortable. It looks really ugly as well, like some sort of body part that has fell of 'The Elephant Man'! :)  I have been told several times by the breast care nurses that it will be re-absorbed by my body, this does not seem to be happening though!!! If anyone can relate to this, or even if you can't & just fancy a chat. I'd love to hear from you  Take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Susan, thanks for your reply. Oh God, it sounds like you went through it with your seroma what with it bursting and everything, and having to constantly have the dressings changed.  I find it quite bad nowadays that we have to make our way to the hospital whenever we need something doing - like you having to visit there 10 times. Like me & others I presume, having to make your own way there with 2 drains hanging out your side, just so you can get them removed. When I had Breast cancer 1st time around (10 years ago) the District Nurses were great and always used to come & visit. Now you have to go to them for everything. I've had my seroma drained twice now and I will go again nxt Tuesday. I hope it's for the last time. I hope you're doing better now Take care Brenda xxx",

I don't think mine is infected, I hope not anyway. The scar looks fine, there's just a big hard lump there, you never know what's going on underneath though do ya? Gonna contact the BC Nurses first thing now tomorrow anyway. Thanks Take care.........Brenda xxx",
