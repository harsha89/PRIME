      "Content": "Hi Bluetit, I don't want to put a downer on the Diep flap reconstruction for you, but my experience with the operation has not been good. I had the operation in May 2011 and I am still struggling with the Diep flap. The operation lasted 12 hours, my family thought I'd gone!! I must say the breast reconstruction is brilliant, no- one knows it's not real even down to the nipple tattoo. My problem has been my stomach, nearly 2 years down the line and I still can't walk properly, my stomach is constantly bloated and painful. Dr has ruled out ovarian cancer! Ultrasound recently showed stomach full of gas, which tablets are not releasing. Having to see Dr again on Monday. Fed up with it to be honest, wouldn't have had it done if I'd known and would have gone for implants. I do have damaged discs in my back, arthritis in my knees and as a result of chemo I now have osteopenia in my spine. If you suffer from any of these problems I wouldn't recommend Diep flap to add to things. I am unable to work now, and had worked for 40 years. Sorry to bring bad comments but thought you needed to know my experience. Judy",

Form and had my whole balance paid off the catalogue. As I hadn't realised I could claim my account was credited with almost enough to purchase a new laptop. Look into it. You might get a good surprise. Judy",

      "Content": "Hi Sandra, I am post surgery and treatment after being diagnosed on 1st APril 2011, but I also had mx with diep flap, followed by chemo and biopsy on left breast due to calcifications. The minor surgery on left breast left me with an abscess which took months to heal and has left an ugly scar on my good breast! I had no problems with the nipple reconstruction, which was identical to yours. After the nipple reconstruction I had a tattoo coloured on the nipple to match. IT has since faded a little but I'm leaving it there, can't take any more! My problems, which I'm hoping you can help is the diep flap. Over 18 months later and I still can' t walk properly. Have recently had an ultrasound to check for ovarian cancer, which was clear but was told my stomach is full of gas! Dr has given me more tests but I look. 9 mths pregnant and it's pressing on scar. Am struggling more with walking than a year ago. Can you suggest anything Hope they sort out your nipple, must be so disappointing. Judy",

      "Content": "Hi, Yes, I've had 2 x 6 sessions of physio but it hasn't helped in the long term. I do have damaged discs in my back and arthritis in my knees. The chemo has also given me osteopenia in my spine. I keep trying but this bout of gas is getting me down and the dr is doing all she can. I did go to a and e too but they couldn't help! I was working full time before all this, now I can't work at all. I'm 56 nod don't feel ready to retire yet even if I could afford it. I sometimes regret having the diep flap and should have settled for implants. I'm grateful they caught it in time though, do trying to stay positive. Judy",

      "Content": "Hi, just wanted to say I had a mastectomy on right breast with diep flap reconstruction in May 2011 and biopsy on left breast due to calcifications. Whilst I have had no problems with the right breast reconstruction, my left breast's scar turned into an abscess that took two months of daily dressing (and absolutely stank) and has now left my good breast with an ugly scar! My diep flap has been the major problem in the 12 hour operation. I still walk hunched over 2 years later and my stomach balloons as if I'm 9 months pregnant leaving me struggling to walk. I've seen a consultant recently who has said my operation was a success and my problem lies elsewhere! So now waiting to see another consultant!! My story has also been in the evening post locally, highlighting the financial cost of cancer. You can see it on www.thisisouthwales.co.uk/Counting-financial-cost-cancer-worry/story-18879284-detail/story-html#axzz2sDc9pExq I know the main thing is getting rid of the cancer but the after effects of more problems and a complete change in lifestyle takes its toll. It is so daunting. Take care xxx Judy",

      "Content": "Hi Becci, I just wanted to say that things will get better. I was diagnosed after a routine mammogram and found to have a 12cm mass growth behind my nipple on right breast. I have never smoked, am not overweight and have always been active and worked since aged 15. I didn't know of any breast cancer in the family either. I also had calcifications in my left breast and wasn't offered a lumpectomy due to the size of the growth and being a grade 3 cancer. I had immediate mastectomy with diep flap reconstruction (taking fat from stomach to use for reconstruction) in an operation that lasted12 hours. My new boob doesn't look any different from my old one and the lady surgeon was a perfectionist. I can wear a bikini top and nobody would know any different. They removed the calcifications from my left breast in another operation. Unfortunately, the scar became infected and I had 2.5 months of daily dressing due to an abscess forming. I have a bigger scar there than in my reconstruction! I had 6 months of intensive chemotherapy but no radiotherapy. My nodes were clear thankfully. 2.5 years on and I'm still here. I have suffered physical problems, I had back problems, arthritis prior to the cancer but these have now worsened(partly due to the letrozole I am taking and have to take for 5 years) I am not working now but am trying to enjoy family life and be home and appreciate it. I truly appreciate my holidays now and have more breaks with my husband than I have ever had. I know I am a lot older than you (I'm 56) but life is tough and cancer puts things into perspective. You will be stronger, there will be tears but family and friends will be there for you who want to be there. Life doesn't have to be all work and no play. Take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Molly, I've been on Letrozole for 2 years now, and for me it's not good news. I've had no thinning of my hair at all, but suffer from fatigue, hot flushes, dizzy spells and blurred vision. My stomach bloats out like a balloon and is painful and my joints ache. I've had ct scans, blood tests and am awaiting results of a barium enema to check, but all points to the letrozole! I had a diep flap mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy in 2011 and then letrozole. I have osteopenia as a result of the chemo, had damaged discs in my back and arthritis in my hands and knees beforehand and I don't think letrozole is helping. I have tried anastozole and tamoxifen, but both of these were worst and had to go back to letrozole. I am grateful to still be here though and will carry on, I'm 57 tomorrow and do glad I can celebrate it. Hopefully things will be easier for you Judy",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your dilemma. Hope they are able to clear the cancer with treatment. I am 2 years post diagnosis of breast cancer and my recent mammogram was clear. Unfortunately, I have been suffering with stomach problems after DIep flap reconstruction. Like you I know something is not right. I've had an ultra sound to check for ovarian cancer, had my surgery checked but am still waiting a scan on stomach and have been on waiting list for months. I've since seen chemo oncologist for routine checkup and he is getting me a scan within 2 weeks and hopefully results in 3 weeks. My mother in law and sister in law both died of stomach cancer and I need to know its not cancer! Don't think the GP realises how it eats us up with worry after having cancer. She was treating me for IBS. I hope you get the right results. Take care xxx Judy",
