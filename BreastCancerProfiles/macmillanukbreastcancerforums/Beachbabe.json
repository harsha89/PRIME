Also I'm so nervous to wear the wig and scarves as don't want comments and stares. All a but unknown. A friend suggested baby shampoo so going to try that tomorrow. Good night xx",

The little princess trust sounds like a great idea but my half is short already, will have a look. Got my wig sorted out today so all ready. My hair is coming out in handfuls and today it's going everywhere so been wearing it up in the house. I thought I was prepared but didn't think it would be like this! Than again and good night",
