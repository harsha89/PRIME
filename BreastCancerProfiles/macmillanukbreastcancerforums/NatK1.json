      "Content": "Yes Er & PR positive is a good thing as it means that you can have hormone therapy to stop the cancer from coming back.  If you have no lymph node involvement and you have a grade 1 or 2 cancer, then you should get away with just an operation, radiotherapy and hopefully hormone therapy. Hopefully a stage 2a",

I am 44 in the Uk (NHS) and the justification were my age, that my cancer was a grade 3, the lymph node found and small cancer specs found in the clear boarder after surgery. It wasn't a 'do you fancy chemo?' discussion, it was a 'we want you to live cancer free well into your 80s and this is the best way to ensure this' conversation.

It was also found to be a grade 3 and not a grade 2. So now doing chemo before radiotherapy and hormone therapy.  Fingers crossed to you Use ER&PR positive people are very lucky to be able to have Hormone blockers to stop the cancer growing ever again",

I cannot recommend enough shaving your hair off to a grade 3 before it falls to get you and your family used to it, as after that it will go really patchy.  I sat all 4 of my children down the minute that I knew that I was having chemo and was just honest with them, telling them that Mummy is gonna get sick before to get better. That it\u2019s just one year out of all of our life\u2019s to enjoy a life time! They were actually fine about my grade 3 - mainly because I was so positive about it and was like \u2018 look how beautiful Mummy is\u2019 ",

Tumour was actually a grade 3 and the clear boarder had specs of cancer cells in. I am 44. Treatment - 4 x EC & 4 x Taxol. Then 5 weeks of radiotherapy and 5/7 years of Tamoxifen ....think this is pretty standard as buckle and braces if you a younger. The chemo acts like a broom sweeping up all the cancer cells and the radiotherapy acts like a mop to catch all the fine bits of glitter left from chemo! ",
