      "Content": "Hi Diana Sorry for the slow reply, I have a huge pile of things I'm trying to catch up after my life has been turned upside down by this diagnosis. Thanks for the info. I've been into Force a few times now and they are very helpful. I'm thinking of checking out the Exmouth group, I think they have a meeting coming up in the first week of March. I have a friend who had BC about 6 years ago, she's very well now and has been so supportive. She was on Herceptin too. My rogue cells are triple neg, so not going to be a treatment option for me. I'd love to meet up but my next session at Cherrybrook is the following Wednesday, and this Wednesday I have to get my Pict line managed. I have the district nurses coming out, they say it will be prioritised for the morning, but can't give me a time, and could be later in the day. What time are you at likely to finish at Cherrybrook? if they do come in the morning, I could meet you at Force. I'm really lucky to live within walking distance of the hospital, so its no problem for me to get over there, I'll just incorporate it in one of my daily walks. if you give me time to meet, I'll try to be there if I can. if that doesn't work out, maybe some other time? Lovely to hear from you Best wishes Lynne x",

Im wondering if there are any members in the Exeter area? Im over 50 so no local support group, only one in Exeter for younger women. Kind of strange as i thought BC was more common in the over 50s. It would be good to connect with people. Im not that wild about online forums but i can see they are really useful souce of support. I just rather speak to people face to face. ",
