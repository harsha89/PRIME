      "Content": "hi everyone  I am a BRCA 2 carrier and have had annual screening with both mammogram and MRI for the past theee years . I had a bilateral oopherectomy 2 years ago and did not go on HRT - I am almost 42.  A couple weeks ago I had my regular mammogram and got a recall for something deep in right breast after further testing of ultrasound they were happy it was nothing to worry about . then I go for my MRI screening and was warned due to any changes tonexpect a recall about the same thing - which I did . I had to go to the western general for an ultrasound and I said yes thinking it was a tick in the box about the same issue from mammogram - which it is but they decided to take 2 biopsies and booked me in for results a week later .  I have 6 sleeps to go but all I can think about is the results - the nurse told me of the radaiograoher lnew from ultrasound it was cancer she would have said but when the radiographer came back into the room with my appt I asked her starting ghtniit to which she replied ' I really dont know '  now my anxiety has flared up hugely and when hubby kids go to work or school I am trying to keep busy but my thoughts wander places I don't want them too ",
