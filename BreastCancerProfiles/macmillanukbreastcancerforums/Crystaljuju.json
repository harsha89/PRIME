      "Content": "Hi Bids24  Are you saying your original surgeon didn't even oversee the surgical procedure? I would say this is definite cause to complain. All he had to do was ask if you minded beforehand. What happened to mean that your surgeon couldn't operate? Unless he was ill he needs a flippin good excuse! I guess it depends on how far you want to take it. Are you happy with the end result? Would the end result have been different with the original surgeon? It might be too early to tell.  I waited 10 days for path results. Three weeks seems awhile but he may have been preempting a backlog at the path lab and erring on the side of caution?  As you are discussed weekly at MDT meetings it could be anyone involved with them to give you results. I was fortunate it was my surgeon who gave me mine.  Your care doesn't sound consistent and that's not fair Nor helpful to you. Make it known that's how you feel.  Julia X ",

I'm 5 months post treatment.  The things I can say that are positive are that they are checking this suspect area out thoroughly. Were any words of comfort given to you after the MRI or any possible reasons for the suspect area? The not knowing really is torture.  To be honest I got so down and fed up with not being me I had to start counselling after treatment and have had 15 sessions which has completely got me back on track. I'm of the opinion that unless I am told I have something that's incurable I will plod on and not worry. The worry and angst quite often is worse than the physical side. I'd had enough of feeling like cr@p but needed psychological help to move on. It may be worth exploring for you.  Anyway, it's good to hear from you again but I'm sorry it's for these reasons.  Julia xx",

Theres no way on earth I would wear a swimsuit.... mainly due to being just under 6ft and never finding a costume long enough haha.  I was lucky in that my scars made me cry with relief when I saw them and I remember making the very sexist comment that I couldn't believe a man could be so precise with nipples and boobs. he said to me if I wasn't happy then he would relook at more surgery but it didn't go way.  Apparently surgery sites will take up to 12 months to settle.  Love Julia x ",

As Maggie says though, the problem with this is that chemo is given a bad name most of the time. Good experiences aren't normally documented , it's mainly the bad. I am always reading how ladies and men are dreading chemo and have even declined treatment due to the 'what ifs'. Chemo is such a personal thing that no one can predict how your body will react. A good example is docetaxel. To date I've never read any good experiences. This made me so frightened yet for me it turned out better than FEC. X ",

If your chemo was Thursday, take more notice of your temp from Tuesday.  A low temperature can be a sign something is wrong. The only way your mind will be put at rest is if you give the chemo unit a ring. Do you feel shivery and achy?  Taking your temperature can become an addiction so try and limit it.

This won't help a back problem as tight backs like to be moved.  This is a catch 22 as you need to move that back but you may not be feeling well enough after chemo to be active.  I've had lower back problems in the past and found the most helpful treatment is regular (4 times a day) ice pack on the area.

It's mad.  From seeing your GP you should see a breast consultant within 2 weeks then start treatment around 4 weeks after a diagnosis. however it's only a guideline Which is used as an arguement.  Waiting for an MRI hasn't helped either. I had to have three body scans before I started treatment so it was 6 weeks before I started. Was the MRI because you have lobular cancer?  When you go on 16th March do make your anxiety known. On the basis you've waited many weeks already they should be offering surgery soon. dont think your cancer is growing uncontrollably (we all did it) because it doesn't and the fact you've had an MRI is good because they are making sure they are dealing with just one primary.  All the best  Julia x",

That can happen consciously or subconsciously.  I had a pathological complete resonse (PCR) to chemo. If your tumour can't be felt at this point there is every chance come lumpectomy that you will have no cancer cells left whatsoever. You won't know that however until after sugery. That is the best outcome you can hope for and you are on the way to achieving this! That HAS to be a good sign and a good indication of prognosis. Please take it as a good sign. Also as JJ says, you don't need a MX. If there are no cancer cells left in your body at this moment.... It can't spread. Chemo has worked on you as the tumour has gone.  Dontread the negative stuff about TNBC if it makes you feel worse during this time. Read the positive things ( research what the prognosis is if you have a PCR from chemo. That will definitely lift you) from all those TN survivors out there. Trust me, when treatment finishes you will learn to live again. It doesn't happen overnight but I do not have the fear I did have. I had the best possible outcome and I now look after myself, the rest is down to my immune system.  Mention your veins in your pre op assessment. If it is a problem it can be overcome with warning.  Take the time between now and 2nd sept to enjoy life, make the most of your days before you feel sore from the operation.  It gets better Jackie x ",

I too, really hope you can act on what you say because Christmas is a time for family and feeling content. You are still here and you are being treated. That's what matters at the moment. As worried2016 says so rightly, don't give yourself the opportunity to look back on this Christmas and say that was a shite time. Make it count.  Instead of feeling sorry you missed the out on the school celebrations make celebrations with your children and husband at home. These are the people that will get you through treatment. School will still be there when you are ready to return. Yes people have survived grade 3, multiple tumours and people are also still surviving worse diagnosis.  You yourself have said how well your body responded to the first chemo. I'd say you were very fortunate as I've never known nausea like I had on FEC. It was dibilitating. So do focus on how much worse it could be if only to make you feel like you are doing pretty darn good.  You are the one that's stopping yourself from living at the moment.  Concentrate on chemo and having a memorable Christmas for the right reasons.  Time is very precious, trust me. love Julia x ",

Almost to the point it panicked me!  The difficulty is that swelling is expected after surgery. Where tissue is removed in a WLE and axilla clearance you are left with vacuums. These fill with fluid .... the reasons why some people still have drains after clearance. That's a normal process of the body dealing with these Vacuums. seromas are common where and how you describe.  lymphoedema presents in a slightly different way. I had lymphoedema in the breast which was treated successfully but it wasn't diagnosed until 6 months post surgery. Are you massaging your breast daily? Light massage towards the good breast is good to get the fluid draining again. Your body has to adjust now you have fewer nodes.  It takes time. Rest assured if you are diagnosed with lymphoedema then you will get a referral to a clinic.  Love Julia x ",

Even though my consultant said I had lymphoedema in the breast he also said it was too early to get referred to our local lympo clinic. I am 7 months post sugery, 3 months post RT. I have been doing self massage which has helped a lot but I am going on holiday to hotter climes in August and have read that temperature can make the swelling worse. Thank you julia",

Are you due a follow up appointment with your surgeon/onc soon? You could ask then or make an appointment with your GP so they can check it out. You need peace of mind.

I wonder how many of us were like that or have we always been totally empathetic. It's only now due to our experiences we can relate.  Now, through no fault of our own, we have experience of cancer and we should now know how to communicate with others who have gone through the same thing. Everyone is different though so what might be acceptable to one won't be to the other.  I truely believe that people don't know what or how to say things to you but they want to speak to you so mouth engages before brain.

In which case your bones may not have influenced the change in drug as the scan wouldn't specifically looked at your bones.   You do need to know why the booster sessions have been added but to be fair I don't think it would have been to do with todays ct scan. 15 or 20 sessions is the norm but 24 seems a lot. You haven't enrolled in a trial? I'm guessing you will only receive peace of mind when you get your BCN/oncologist to explain. We have all been there. Got home and thought why didn't I ask that.

You may get a better response starting a new thread with this but I'll answer anyway to try and help.  im sorry you find yourself in this situation But it's good things are being checked. It's important. There are a few stages to the breast unit referral. You will get physically examined, then a mammogram then possibly an US and biopsy. They don't always do a biopsy if they can rule the worst out but if you do get to that stage do be asking questions if you need to. I had an US as well as mammogram As they can look at lymph nodes via this method if needed. You will get the mammo for sure Though. some clinics don't give results the same day. I waited 10 days. You will need to ask if you can record any conversation. It's good to always take someone with you and do ask to be copied into any correspondence written about you.  This is a crap time For you. Your mum will be a great support to you. You will feel like it's wait wait wait.  Im heading towards two years post diagnosis and was successfully treated. BC is very treatable but let's not jump the gun.  Please do come back and let us know how you get on and I send you all Good wishes love.  Julia X  ps take some pain relief before you go to the appointment just incase as the biopsy can hurt.

It also gets worse by the end of the day due to gravity working its magic. I had odema in the breast and by night time the breast was so firm and pink and bigger than the opposite one.  Is your breast much better in the morning?  it is unusual for it to happen in your good side but I just wanted to say that lymphoedema can cause symptoms very similar to IBC.

My own opinion is that preventative surgery is still the optimum for brca positive. I would be happier with a bilateral mx.  As Lynn says, there are options regarding reconstruction but be guided sensibly by your surgeon.  i would be asking more questions about chemo if you are ER+ only. Ask what benefit it would give over and above hormonal therapies. The hormonal therapies are key but do come with side effects due to suppressing oestrogen. They are given over 5 years but some now over 10 so do check what length of time you would need to take them. On the basis that even with no ovaries to produce oestrogen, you developed BC, so need those hormonal therapies.  Rt in comparison to chemo isn't bad just very time consuming and you can only be zapped in one area once so you wouldn't be able to have more in the future.  All the best with your decision making. I took weeks to decide on surgery with many visits to my surgeon. don't feel rushed making it. love  Julia x ps life post bc for me...... much more fullfing than pre",

Saying that, having things sprung on you is never easy so i appreciate this is a complete U turn in your treatment. I always knew i needed to be tested as was deemed at risk.  The genetics nurse would have explained both outcomes of the test to you and you have to consent to the blood being taken. I am at risk from a heredity brain disorder that killed my father and his twin sister. I decided i do not want to know if I carry that gene mutation (notch3) as there is no cure or preventative treatment for it. If i have the mutation i will get the disease andI can't live waiting to die.   With the brca1/2 mutation test there is preventative treatment available but only if you consent to it. But thats a positive.... there is preventative treatment just like hormonal therapies but unfortuntely it includes more surgery.   you have already got two different professional opinions on your risk of carrying the gene mutatuon so already its not stacking up In the genes favour. I tested negative and waited three months fpr results. It was a huge releif but i tried to think of a positive result as a continuation of the treatment. I also needed to know if i carried the gene mutation so i could draw a line under it either way. i really will keep my fingers crossed for a negative result for you. If you think negatively about this test then 8 weeks is a long time to be holding onto those feelings. sending hugs Julia x    ",

      "Content": "Hi H Sorry to read of your Mums diagnosis and good on you for getting stuck into the advice. I had TNBC too and had chemo first. I waited just over 10 weeks between chemo and surgery and it had no detrimental affect however it turned out I had had a pathological complete response to chemo so all cancer cells had gone after chemo. I don't think 7 weeks and 4 days will be detrimental at all. The good news is that after 7 weeks your Mum will have recovered better from chemo than she would have at 4-6 weeks so will be in better shape for surgery. So many of us on diagnosis think we will be better off having a bilateral MX. I was one. Having a healthy breast removed reduces another primary BC but will have no affect on whether a secondary cancer happens or not. Its harsh but I was told by my surgeon having both breasts removed did not mean I would not die of BC. I rethought my decision and had a WLE and have no regrets. I am left with both breasts without much sign of surgery. It is very difficult to listen to others when you are going through BC. I completely understand that you and other family members would say have a bilateral but when you have to make the decision yourself its very tough. The surgery itself is more complex and more things can go wrong. You also have to figure out how it will feel to no longer have your breasts. It may sound easy to say take them away but its not. I would go with what the surgeon is suggesting. I was told that RT does come with a slight risk of causing another cancer so its always possible that your Mums first round of RT was an aggravating factor but something you can never prove unfortunately. All the best for surgery. I hope it all goes to plan whatever the decision. Julia x",

The worry and anxiety will otherwise End up presenting itself in other ways. If it is BC, as Pat says, it sounds very early stages. Until you are given the results try and fool your brain that nothing has changed. You will have been waiting a long time for the results, does your breast care unit not provide cover for consultants? It doesn't seem very fair. I have seen many locums when my consultant has been away.  all the best for the 28th x",

      "Content": "Hi Judy  Sorry to read you are having to go through more tests. Preventative bilateral Mxs are normally carried out for Brca gene mutation carriers on the basis it reduces the risk of having primary BC. However as we already have or have had BC specialists will argue that mx is often over treatment  and will make no difference to wether the BC comes back elsewhere in our bodies. Do check with your specialist if they are saying it doesn't help recurrence in the breast or secondary recurrence elsewhere in the body.  Mxs are given where there are large tumours or multiple cancer sites. I was going to have a mx but neoadjuvant chemo meant my tumour disappeared by the time I came to have surgery so I opted for a WLE. Clear margins were obtained so I knew the rest of my breast tissue was cancer free.  I am very comfortable with the decision I made as my breast looks like it did pre BC and they are both still equal.  You always have a choice but the results from the next biopsie will dictate surgery to a large extent. If the tests reveal nothing suspicious then in my experience do trust the WLE if that's all they are suggesting.   ",

I liked the hot hair styles.  Your local cancer support centre may offer fitting services but I found the choice of wigs limited.  Do ask at your chemo unit where local options are as they should be more than familiar. Failing that Google wig services in your area, just double check they take NHS prescriptions.   One word of caution though... don't get sucked in to buying shampoos, conditioners, sprays etc etc as they aren't covered and I ended up with about 6 bottles of stuff I 'apparently' needed that coat a small fortune.

I knew that indicated the worse but knew if It was confirmed then I would worry even more before I was officially told and had the way forward described. Try turning things on their head. If you were told during the biopsie it was BC but no further information was given about treatment etc or any how would you now feel.  As for being prepared for cancer...... It's not human instinct to be prepared for this kind of cr&£. There are protocols about giving diagnosis so it's likely the doctor doing the tests wasn't trained to do that or even make that judgement on whether it was definitely BC or not.  BC has taken a year of my life but if that gives me many more years on this planet (I was 41 when diagnosed) then it was so worth it.  X  ",

I had a problem with the epruibicin. It's red and so red that I associated it with danger and if I saw it in the syringe, would get sick. I had a soap at home I had to chuck  out as I developed an association with sickness and this soap. if I could smell it I would be sick. The smell of the chemo unit would also do it. Even the smell of my kitchen made me sick it was weird.  You need some help to turn it into disassociation and that will be by mental processes and distraction . You need a thought strategy to concentrate on whilst you have the drugs. But not being able to see the drugs might help. Not looking at what's going on helps. You could try headphones and eyes closed or a eye mask on.  good luck with it. It's a common thing so the unit will be able to help no doubt. Love Julia x ",

I had high expectations that weren't meet so now I have no idea expectations and I feel much better about appointments. I'm being seen every three months so it helps with any anxietys. You are in the best place whilst having counselling.  Regarding the scans, these are only undertaken if there is an ongoing problem that needs checking out or you take drugs that could affect the heart or bones.  If you think rationally about having a scan though, if you had one and a week later got a all clear result, for how long would that clear result appease your anxiety? A couple of months I am guessing before you would want another. It would be a vicious cycle. Ultimately you could pay privately for a scan but how much help would it be in the long term. Learning to trust your body again is the key. As life moves on and you get more involved in life again the less the anxieties get.  Julia x",

      "Content": "Hi GMc  I can't pretend I wasn't hard on my partner of 9 years during treatment because I was. I was scared and I couldn't cope with him showing any signs of being scared Or emotional. He also came and lived with me and looked after my 9 year old with me which caused friction too. I look back now and feel embarrassed by how I was at times. However we got through treatment In one piece.  It didn't end happily ever after though because we did end up splitting up 6 months after treatment finished. I was of the opinion that as we had got through cancer we could get through anything and I felt closer to my man. He didn't feel the same. It took a lot out of him and he walked away. Listen to your wife vent, tell her you understand and you are always in sickness and in health. See how you both feel when treatment ends. It will either all be brushed under the carpet and you move on together or it maybe a time when as George says, you take stock of what you have and what you haven't got In the relationship.  its true when they say we hurt those close to us the most. I would be more worried if your wife stops communicating all together. Never a good sign. All the best. I know from experience how tough it can be. Julia ",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly  This topic comes up a lot on this forum, understandably, as if like me, look forward to a glass of wine, it would be hard to ban it. If we put BC aside for a moment and look at The recommended weekly units of alcohol for both men and women, they have been put in place for a reason. The more we drink the more we put our health at risk.  I have always been very health and exercise conscious but did drink around 20 units of wine per week. I now only drink a bottle (10 units). I've even made more changes to my diet since diagnosis but for me it's always been a big part of my life so they aren't drastic changes for me. I made these changes even though I was triple neg and there is no evidence that alcohol affects triple neg bc.  I have met many ladies who carry on smoking after BC and are overweight and never exercise but are happy that way and there is a lot to be said for self happiness. Others I've met have changed lifestyles completely as it's been a wake up call and have felt and looked the better for it.  If you gave up alcohol completely would it make you miserable? If so consider sticking within the recommended limits for other health benefits as well as lowering your chance of recurrence.  There is much more evidence that says being physically active after BC lowers your chance of recurrence and for me it's much more achievable than giving up the wine!  As sister snail says, you do what makes you the most happy  x",

I am having an ultrasound on 22 no for the same reason only i have a lump low down in my neck and no cold however the GP thought it more than likely to be a lipoma. That's good enough for me! I can't bear worrying anymore so I tend to switch off. The best you can do is getting it checked out which you are doing. Nodes at the back of the ears are less worrying than those lower in the neck/along the collar bone. I know it's hard not to think the worse but I really do send you positive vibes as there is nothing worse than persistent anxiety and when you get the all clear you will say to yourself what a waste of emotion worrying over nothing. It's a good thing we are in tune with our bodies I'm certainly more in tune with mine than pre BC.  Love Julia x ",

However as you received a cc letter your have probably asked to be copied in to all correspondence written about you? I did and it helped as the letters where more comprehensive than what the consultant told me face to face.  It's always shocking seeing a result written down though.  Get on to you breast care unit and ask that you receive results verbally and get more info on your diagnosis. Invasive BC means its not longer 'in situ' but broken out into either the milk ducts it lobules. The results also indicate the cancer cells have travelled to your lymph nodes. Don't view this as a negative as the lymph nodes are like sieves they drain out the good and bad so the cancer cells have been caught. That's the reason you have had body scans, just to check your treatment will he for primary BC only.  The MRI on the other breast maybe because you have invasive lobular BC? Has that been mentioned?  This is one hell of a learning curve and a awful time. Keep posting. We will support you and answer any questions you have.  All the best X  Ps grade 2 is the intermediate level. Grade 3 being the high grade, grade 1 the low grade. ",

Having immediate results can be good but it also means you could wake up finding they have removed more nodes than you have hoped. It's a gamble But you need to weigh up which risk is greater to you... The risk of lymphoedema or the possibility of cancer cells being left in the nodes. Do ask about rt to the Axilla though.

      "Content": "Hi Mildred  As you are anxious about secondaries even before you treatment has ended you need to nip it in the bud as it will get out of hand.  At the moment you are sensitive to every ache and pain but you need your brain to put perspective on it. Tamoxifen causes all sorts of bone and joint pain along with a whole host of other side affects. It's bound to be the drug.  It's unlikely you will be offered a ct scan although it's worth mentioning the back pain. You won't be able to sustain scan after scan after every ailment. Anxiety has to be learnt to be managed.  Trusting your body is he hardest but best thing you can do.  Your cancer was grade 1 and I'm assuming no nodes were affected due to you not mentioning chemo? Grab hold of the positives. Secondaries in your case are statistically not going to happen.  It won't help if you aren't getting out and about having 'you' time. Do try and squeeze this in. Most BC units run a moving in course. I would recommend this. You will then see we ALL have the same worries. How long we let them affect us is the key thing.  I'm 9 months post treatment now and time is a great healer. Your anxiety will lessen but at the moment you have another hurdle. That hurdle will be finishing treatment. That's the hard bit... Being let lose back into the wilderness.  Julia X ",

I had to have MRi's, bone scan and a CT scan before my treatment started because there was a risk of secondary's on diagnosis. I used to feel physically sick whilst waiting for these results.  Turns out I had one solitary tumor with one affected node. That didn't stop my head from telling me I was dying. What I will say is that BC is so very treatable. It sounds so flippant but its true. I am two years post diagnosis. I had an 9 year girl to take care of. It was just me and her at home. The best advice I was given was 'this will take up to 12 months out of your life'. I remember thinking ' you are flipping joking'. They weren't wrong. I didn't work for 11 months. I had chemo, surgery and radiotherapy then months of counseling. Its a tough time. I would say its unrealistic that you will be joining the school at the start of Autumn term in September. Coping in the holidays is a very valid worry. This is time to call on friends and family to help out. You wont be able to maintain a good and consistent level of care for four kids. (Respect to you for doing this now). Hubby will have to take on being the strong one whilst you get this done. You never know he might actually enjoy the challenge. You have to be honest about what you need though and men like lists of things they can do to help. You are very right in that this will be a time when you see people for what they really mean to you. I was lucky in that I had a couple of close friends who carried me through treatment. For that I am always grateful. Keep someone close because you will need to talk and be allowed to talk. Don't keep those anxieties rattling around in your head. Julia x_",

Keep as busy as you can And try not to fret about what you don't yet know. I appreciate its hard but the whole cancer journey can be worry after worry. Managing it is key.  I hope your consultant can change your opionion of him next time. I did find some abrupt but some folk appreciate the less flowery approach. There is however no excuse for rudeness. He may have being speaking about a mx and chemo to give you the most onerous end of the spectrum to make sure you know what the perameters are. Nothing worse than having something sprung onto you When treatment is already in place.  Until you get those results that tell you you are only dealing with a solitary tumour, the treatment plan cant be put into place. I don't think for one minute the consultant is hiding anything from you. I do know on diagnosis  we become very volnurable making us mistrusting. It's a defence mechanism.  Questions you could ask ....  What surgery do they recommend and why  Are they doing anything with the axilla what are the chances of having chemo/what does that hinge on will they recommend radiotherapy  Two days to go now. You are nearly there. Once you are you will find everything moves very quickly so it will be one extreme to the other.

The mental state has been more challenging. Absolutely no amount of 'preparing' can ever prepare you for chemo. For starters nobody can tell you how you will react to it it literally is  a case of lets see what happens. I had neoadjuvant chemo too and by the end was a wreck. Bear in mind that they effects can get harsher as the chemo accumulates. But you sound as though you have done the research to find ways in which to give your body the best chance of recovery. I had melt downs every cycle. I would shout scream and say that was it I wasnt going to have any more. I really did throw my dollies out of the pram. I literally survived each day at a time and had no expectations beyond that. In hindsight I can say that chemo was the worse out of the three stages but they all come with challenges in itself. Chemo messes with your head big time, but remember its the chemicals, not you. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotion gets you through the day. Tomorrow will be a new day and may bring strength and positivity. Just think of that nasty 'swamp juice' (chemo) killing all those cancer cells and making you better long term. This sounds like I am blowing my own trumpet but I had a pathological complete response to chemo so it can happen. Nothing will be the same again for you after treatment but that just means finding the new you (without cancer). You dont need to face that yet. My biggest tip, literally take each day as it comes and allow yourself to feel or do whatever you want. Its just about survival. Its absolutely ok to be needy, emotional and feel hopleless. Get a big calendar and mark off every day that you get through until that finish line is in sight..... which isnt far away for you. You will do it.",

Time will tell if he's just letting off steam or he means business. When we are in pain we have no tolerance to relationship bollocks and we will be much more volatile.  Bite your lip and concentrate on getting you through the rough. Has your husband a mate you could ask to speak to him to check in with him? No doubt he's scared but can't express this without being angry.

If we put BC aside for a moment and look at The recommended weekly units of alcohol for both men and women, they have been put in place for a reason. The more we drink the more we put our health at risk.  I have always been very health and exercise conscious but did drink around 20 units of wine per week. I now only drink a bottle (10 units). I've even made more changes to my diet since diagnosis but for me it's always been a big part of my life so they aren't drastic changes for me. I made these changes even though I was triple neg and there is no evidence that alcohol affects triple neg bc.  I have met many ladies who carry on smoking after BC and are overweight and never exercise but are happy that way and there is a lot to be said for self happiness. Others I've met have changed lifestyles completely as it's been a wake up call and have felt and looked the better for it.  If you gave up alcohol completely would it make you miserable? If so consider sticking within the recommended limits for other health benefits as well as lowering your chance of recurrence.  There is much more evidence that says being physically active after BC lowers your chance of recurrence and for me it's much more achievable than giving up the wine!  As sister snail says, you do what makes you the most happy  x",

      "Content": "HI Kim45  Having gone through chemo myself I would say a definite no.  I suffered severe nausea  on FEC which was always made worse on an empty stomach. The thought of adding chemo drugs to am empty stomach is not good. Most meds you are advised to take with food. I know chemo is taken through the blood but it will affect digestion big time. The trick is to eat little but often and avoid foods high in fat before chemo. The other thing you will find out is that chemo affects your taste and ability to eat foods without feeling sick so there will be lots of foods you can't stomach. I lived on chips and humous as it was the only thing I could stomach. Diet and nutrition go totally out of the window for at least a week after chemo. approach comparing other people's chemo experiences with caution. There are so many chemo drugs and all have different side effects. To compare is impossible. Do join our monthly chemo club where you can chat to others going through it at the same time. All the best love  Julia xx ",

The staffing issues at your unit should not have an impact on your planned treatment. Are you having chemo adjuvantly?  Docextacel (it that's what you now having) is also very powerful so don't think this is the lesser of the evils.  You need to be told the reason why your oncologist has ditched one cycle and I would be inclined to be asking now. Phone the onc reception and explain why you need to see the onc or at least have a telephone conversation.  All the best x",

Even if it means spring cleaning your house! Wednesday is two days away and you will be told then what the biopsies have thrown up. It will either be non sinister in which case you will kick yourself over the level of worry you have put yourself through. if it's a cancer diagnosis there will be a treatment plan put into place. Bc has the highest rate of  successful treatment. I'm three years post diagnosis and was successfully treated. Please don't assume because your mum had BC that you will too especially as it was bowel cancer that took your mum. Was the bowel cancer a new cancer or connected to the breast cancer? being 40 is a major birthday. I was 41 on diagnosis But boy did I celebrate being 40. Dont right your birthday celebrations off.

However after the first session it no longer becomes the unknown and the fear is taken away, you get your head down and get stuck into getting through the ordeal. You will do it and you may do without mamy SE at all, you just don't know yet.  With EC you will more than likely feel sick. My sickness would come on 5/6 hours after and I found sleeping as soon as I got home helped. Eat small meals regularly both before and after and avoid anything too sweet and stodgy. Think healthy and light. It helps in a queasy tummy. You will be given all the medication to combat SE.  You probably could drive home but I would suggest if you can take someone for support it would be much better.  Drink lots of fluid before you go in and continue to do this for at least 3 days after a session. Over 2 litres per day. Have small snacks in the house, crackers, ginger biscuits, ice lollies, squash, bottled water. I developed a craving for humous I lived on the stuff throughout FEC. seeing the oncology unit and being given the low down from the professionals will ease your fear. They deal with this day in day out and in my experience are very kind caring nurses.  chemo is a means to an end to cancer and you will get through it.

You are in the mind set that you are going to get every possible side effect going and thats not helpful.  Any grade 3 bc or a her2+ or triple negative cancer has a higher recurrence rate so you are not alone. I had Tnbc and was genetically tested. The results were negative.  i had a complete pathological response to chemo so ultimitely it was my lifesaver. Anything so powerful at killing cancer will make itself none so you will experience some side effects. You need to develop a positive approach however. I needed chemo, no question so I just got my head down and got through it however I could. Fec made me very sick and I found eating regularly and small amounts helped. Fasting before chemo can cause problems with the drugs you take before chemo start so do check with your Onco nurse if you go down that route.  Keep positive, eat well and excercise regularly Between now and when you start. Take each day as it comes. When you start, sleep as much as it off as you can and don't expect to much. Be informed, know the risks of sepsis and don't take risks.  Im 18 months post chemo and have no lasting side effects. You mention 'the side effects you are all having trouble with' in you post...... That might be generalising somewhat as we don't all have all of the side effects.  All the best julia X ",

He may use a guide wire inserted into your breast pre op using ultrasound so he knows exactly where he's going in and he will mark up your breast with a pen. It's very precise.  im sure your surgeon will say to you that there is always the risk that once the breast has been opened they find more than what was seen on the scan. It's a warning we all get But one they have to give.  once the cancer has been removed along with a margin of surrounding tissue it will get sent to a path lab to make sure clear margins have been achieved. That's the measure used to say they got all the cancer out. Again there is a risk they don't and you need further surgery.  Remember this is all still very new to you but your surgeon will be very experienced at this. My WLE experience was a good one. Clear margins achieved and a scar that follows my aerola. I was very surprised at the neatness of Everything. So surprised I cried with relief when the dressings came off.  Julia X ",

The million and 1 questions is normal and just your minds way of trying to make sense of being out of control.  As already said, the tumour size isn't always an indicator that cells have travelled to your lymph nodes. Only scans can confirm the size of the tumour and give an indication of how you lymph nodes are. With regard to you insurance policy, you need to check the terms as some policies only cover certain types of BC. When you took the policy out you would have had to declare if you were a smoker or non smoker. If you claim on that policy there is a lot of paperwork that your GP and your consultants fill out. One of the questions to your GP asks if you are a smoker. If you have declared this to your GP it will have been recorded on your records and will have to be reported to the insurance claim. The process only took around 4-6 weeks for me and it was a fairly straight forward process.  All the best.  Julia ",

The mental effects of cancer is much underestimated by those not having experienced it (professionals).  You haven't completed chemo yet but are trying to 'move on', worrying about work, worrying about holiday and it's all too much. Break things down. Keep an eye on that chemo finish post, then see how you feel about a holiday then work. I've just returned to work but don't really want to be there as I would rather be doing things that make me happy. If I'm honest, work isn't one of them even though it indicates 'normality', and I use that term loosely.  I was adamant that due to my anxiety levels I was having a mastectomy. My surgeon told me his worry was that I would have life changing surgery unnecessarily then find at the end of it I was still anxious. He was right. Everyone of us feel this anxiety. Some days it's more prevailent than others. Many breast care units offer moving on courses to support the transition. Counselling helps me to control anxiety levels, it's an option.  One step at a time, then it won't feel so overwhelming.  I would guess we don't hear from Survivors on this forum often because they have moved on which is a good thing. You do reach a point where you decide that you no longer need the support of this forum. It works differently for everyone though xx  ",

It may be that you wait until after 35. Or stop tamoxifen early but I guess the longercyou take the drug the less chance of carrying a child.  I don't take hormonal therapies so have no experience. However if it were me I would be asking how my risk would increase. Stopping the tamoxifen will put you at risk but also getting pregnant will also add to this due to the levels of oestrogen your body will need to carry a child. there may also be an optimum time to wait before your body is ready for a pregnancy. It took my body a good year for my periods to return and hormonal levels to get back to some sort of normal. Even with TNBC I was advised not to have children post treatment.  There will be blood tests you can have to see what your hormones are doing. you could \"ask a nurse\" on this forum. I know they are very helpful.  Love Julia xx",

I don't worry because for a while I did worry and it affected my life to the extent I wasn't functioning. I realised not only was that not fun but not helpful to my daughter or my family. Life was crap.  All of us have the potential of anxiety because we have had cancer once already. In time that anxiety fades as life returns to its fullness. We want to be alive and live well so we can't afford to worry. What do we gain from worrying about the what ifs? Statistics are on our side.   ",

That means although the cancer cells have reached the lymph nodes (the tumour is likely to have been there for some time) it hasn't got into your blood stream and therefore less chance of it circulating around your body.  the bone scan maybe to just make sure it hasn't gone anywhere else. It's very routine so don't think the worst. I had three scans before treatment commenced.  I had neoadjuvant chemo (chemo first). It means your consultant is hopeful  that chemo will shrink the tumour enough for you to have breast conservation surgery. Which means they cut away the remains of the tumour and surrounding tissue and you will be left with your own Breast. If you have surgery first as the tumour is sizeable you will be left with very different breasts. chemo first is good as you get to see it working on that tumour.  so many of us had no symptoms whatsoever when diagnosed. Scary stuff. The weird thing is that treatment will make you feel pants but you have to remember it's short term and for the much greater good.  Do ask your consultant  these questions too as its their job to keep you informed.  julia ",

That may have repercussions because you aren't able to say how and what you really feel. Almost like in a counselling session. I had many months of conselling and I've never felt better but gosh it took months post treatment. We are polite to friends because really who wants to be a conversation stopper by being vocal about how we are really feeling. You may also not be prepared for sympathy/shite comments or them not knowing what to say. In our eyes saying nothing is best. I was always honest with my partner and one best friend. To be honest she really dig deep when asking about how I felt so I never felt I wanted to hide and it helped having her listen.  We can't keep a lid on emotions though not forever. It's bad for mental health. Carolyn28, it sounds a bit like avoidance tactics. Avoiding Not being part of everyday 'normal'(mundane) bits of life. You are right, it could be that you are waiting rather than engaging with life again. I had the opposite trouble... I was so overwhelmed by everyone saying I was to 'move on' my poor swede got overloaded with what to chanhe first.. My body, my job, my house, my friends, my partner and even my hair colour!

I always felt like I was treated as an older lady.  The one thing that did help was my unit offering a 'mentor' . It ended up being a lady of similar age and had gone through the same thing. I was given her contact details and I text as phoned her when I needed. Never met her until 2 years later. It was immense support for me. Triple negative bc is more likely in younger women and I found my BC nurse could tell me nothing regarding TNBC. It was almost as if the less said the better. That's not helpful when you know you have a potentially nasty BC with no preventative therapies.  I asked for a reading material to support me telling my 9 year old and it took her an age to find a aged dog eared booklet that she had to blow the dust off. It was soooout of date I was horrified and binned it. It was called mummy's lump and the pictures were something from the 80's.  I still think the younger lady is treated as the minority as therefore we miss out on a lot of support.  The only BC nurse I bonded with was the head one as she was my age and I could talk as a younger person. love Julia xx ",

That post it note, those flowers or a little 'I love you'. The problem with feeling \"let down\" is you turn it into anger And resentment.  Your daughter no doubt thinks you kept her in the dark and to her that's a sign of not being open and close enough for you to confide. I can relate to that as my mum hid  the severity of my dads illness. Then Suddenly he died. I was angry. What I appreciate though (I'm 43) is that my mum did what she felt was best.. you did what you felt was best. You need to have a frank and open conversation with your daughter why you took time in telling her and how cancer has made you feel. No its not nice to talk about cancer with your kids but it's also good to get comfort and support from your close ones. Bear in mind your daughter will also be as scared as you are. It won't hurt to let her know that. Say to your family when they glaze over when you talk treatment that you need to talk and it's helpful to you if they listen.  Dispite cancer affecting more of us than not people are still in the dark when talking about it. This is your chance to educate family and friends If you think you don't get the support you would or have shown them. Failing that... spoil yourself. Indulge. I never gave up on buting shoes and bags through treatment. I may have lost my identity but still loved to spoil me.  Love  Julia x ",

I've always been a big fan of Vitamin E cream so continued to use that. I do agree that maintaining a well hydrated skin is important regardless of RT. It may be that clinical trials are not planned for this cream although it makes me nervous that GP's are giving out this cream. Personally I think that creams that are given by the a RT unit can act as a placebo. I wasn't given any cream which made me feel my SE were worse than they should have been. They weren't.

Your question is so very valid, how do you get a balance?  The biggest influence is the amount of time that passes when your treatment ends. You aren't completed yet so take the impending RT as another belt and braces attack.  I had a major wobble when treatment ended and had four months of counselling which has brought my psychological wellbeing to its most healthy.  Time really is a great healer and you must trust your body. Cancer aside we all get ill, aches and pains and let's face we grow older. As we have had cancer our minds automatically jumps to the wrong conclusions. If you reason with yourself and think that the pains you have are short lived and the fact your cancer has been removed there is very little chance it's back so why does your brain say it's back.  Life will return for you and actually takes over again quite quickly post treatment. I am 10 months post treatment and it's a distant memory and I live very happily and very content but it's taken me a good 6 months to get there. Trust your body not your mind.  Julia X ",

Nodes will be removed during surgery if the dye shows that some/one are affected. You need to be clear however how many they will remove if say just one or two nodes are affected. If none are affected then nothing will be removed.  Call in favours and get more help in for your dad. You cannot go through surgery and maintain the same level of care you are giving your dad at the moment. It's only Temporary.  Phone your BC nurse and get answers to your questions. You can't maintain this level of emotion you will end up in a bad mental state. Ask your GP for help to get you calmer.  The best you can do is take this one step and a time.  Love Julia x ",

It is then down to you and your employer to agree what adjustments are going to be necessary. This means talking. Small employers have little of know knowledge about cancer patients. If you work for a larger employer and they have an occupational health unit then you can be referred to OH who will then assess you and make recommendations on what your phased return will look like. You do need to be open with your employer about your needs, otherwise they will assume you can go straight back into the workplace which will be detrimental to your health. I work in a very challenged environment so I asked not to answer a phone for a good 6 weeks when I returned as I feared that I would just flake if someone got stroppy with me.

It can happen to any of us at any point.  im sure you will have seen the Breast, Secondary Cancer Group - Discussion Forum  which will give you access to other ladies with secondaries and the names of drugs involved in that treatment.  Im hoping your oncologist will be able to rest your mind soon because secondaries in the bone is manageable and if they are considering surgery then it sound like they are on the ball. all the best  Hugs  Julia X ",

I always knew I'd have chemo so I had plenty of time to sort it in my head.  If the tests come back low risk then you can breathe a sigh of relief. If they come back high scoring then you know that chemo is tough but it's not as scary as having cancer itself. So many of us on here have had chemo and we are still here to tell the tale. If the score comes back intermediate then that's the hard decision as the oncologist may hand over the decision to you.  its good you have had the oncotype dx test, not everyone does so at least you have the maths behind the chemo decision.  whatever the outcome we are always here to support you.  I will be thinking of you today.  Julia X ",

Your thinking about things that you don't need to be thinking about at this time.  Break treatment down into bits. First is surgery so concentrate only on that. Nodes will be removed during surgery if the dye shows that some/one are affected. You need to be clear however how many they will remove if say just one or two nodes are affected. If none are affected then nothing will be removed.  Call in favours and get more help in for your dad. You cannot go through surgery and maintain the same level of care you are giving your dad at the moment. It's only Temporary.  Phone your BC nurse and get answers to your questions. You can't maintain this level of emotion you will end up in a bad mental state. Ask your GP for help to get you calmer.  The best you can do is take this one step and a time.  Love Julia x ",

There are so many different types the possibilities are endless and many take what treatment is offered.  The point being as you are now no evidence of disease you will have no way of knowing how your forthcoming chemo will affect any cancer cells that may or may not be hiding out in your body. There are no measures So without that you have no way of knowing what it's doing. At least with neo adjuvant chemo you can see it working.  Recurring cancer can become resistant to chemo but that's not a reason to not have it now. You have chemo now to reduce your chances of ever having another episode.  The Onco type test is a very good test which provides statistical evidence based upon your tumour. It's tailor made and was designed so that it takes the guess work out of whether you will benefit from chemo.  Try not to delve to deeply as you run the risk of talking yourself out of it. Trust the test.  Julia X ",

The problem is that although it looks like on the scans that the lymph nodes have shrunk you don't know if there are still cancer cells in them. Only after testing them once removed will you know. I had a pathological complete response to chemo but this was only confirmed once I had had surgery And they were sent to the path lab.  Even though the procedure is called Axilla clearance it doesn't mean they will remove all your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes cluster together so they will remove those surround the affected nodes. I had 11 removed. 1 had been affected. We have a varying amount of lymph nodes in this area but most common is around early 20.    Personally I wanted nodes removed even though it was looking like I had had a pcr to chemo. Lymph nodes are in the lymphatic system and its risky to leave possible cells in this system to circulate around the body. I had surgery 15 months ago and have no lymphoedema in the arm but did get it in the breast. That was due More to the wide local excision I had done.  My Axilla scar is not very visible on me.  All the best  Julia X ",

Bearing in mind though I'm two and a half years down the road from diagnosis and life has definitely caught me up. I remember too being bored. Then within weeks of being back at work, wished I was off. It seemed like there was no pleasing me.  It's so difficult for our heads to accept rest and waiting when it's forced upon us.  I would have suggested preoccupy yourself with friends but you have done that. The sleeping is a problem. Have you thought about sleeping in the day (it's allowed even when your a grown up!) or taking herbal sleeping remedies at night or sleeping tabs from the GP? We can only sustain limited sleep up to a point.  Wednesday was only 2 working days ago and there are another 5 working days to wait. Try and kid yourself you are on holiday. Having gone through chemo myself I know you will be preoccupied feeling quite poo for a lot of the time so feeling ok now is good in comparison.  I watched the entire box set of breaking bad and fell in love with Wentworth Miller in Prison break. He was a great distraction.  I found planning really helpful.... Decorating schemes/christmas presents/ holidays and Pinterest is fab. Hugs Julia xx ",

The idea is to shrink or obliterate the tumour so that a good WLE can be performed. I had a 25mm tumour which if had been removed from my breast from the start would have Meant a very wonky and misshaped boob! As it turned out I had to have minimal tissue removed and I'm left with equal sized breasts And I had a complete response to chemo which is my golden nugget that I cling to when I have those moments of panic over recurrence.  Ann you are right, many ladies that are ER+ don't know until after surgery if they would benefit from chemo.  Julia X ",

      "Content": "Hi Bev  I feel where you are coming from. Weight gain and hair loss where the things that upset my mental wellbeing the most.  I was a size 10 going into cancer and have been for the last ten years. I love food but am a big exercise bunny. That's how I keep in shape.  I found through chemo you are lucky to be able to eat some days through nausea then on other days you crave bizarre foods you wouldn't normally eat. I had to go with the flow. I really would suggest you don't try and follow any meal replacement plan diet whilst your body will be at an all time low. It's too risky.  You can however keep active throughout (if you are already active). I had to stop running as my lungs just couldn't cope but I did indoor cycling throughout and I did fitness classes. Chemo alone didn't cause my weight gain. You could say it's steroids but it's normally much more simple than that .......Throughout treatment we are forced to become less active and our eating habits so change do we put on weight. Treatment also causes pyschological issues which tend to manifest themselves in what we choose to eat and when.  I put on a stone over a 8 month period due to not being able to run. It took 6 months to shift but I'm now back to my pre cancer body shape and running a half marathon in three weeks.  I am a huge advocate of excercise and have been all my adult life. There are so many reasons why we should do it.  Do mention the shake diet to the chemo nurses, I think they will say no but do check.  It's a tough time, one of the many many things beyond our control at this time but you can excercise when you feel like it. Take back some control. Put together a little excercise plan for weeks 2 and 3.  But you never know you might not gain anything you may lose it. Remember it's not just chemo alone that causes it.  If you are going to be taking hormonal therapies that will bring separate issues.  All the best with the Fec . Julia X ",

You can get on it not caring how you look or who sees you. When you feel up to get on and start gently and build up every time you go on it. It's amazing how pleased with yourself you feel after. I got such a sense of putting up my two fingers to BC when I excercised during chemo.  I know the hardest thing is doing it. I'm still the same. I'm due a long training run today and I'll sit here for a good two hours or so procrastinating about when or why I shouldn't go. Even when I'm doing it I swear, I'm grimacing and thinking what the hell. Not fun at all but I can't describe that feeling of satisfaction when I've done it. I never thought I would be back to being able to run 13 miles, never.  Anything is better than nothing Bev.  Concentrate on getting through chemo and get on that treadmill when you can and try and eat well. That's the best you can do and I am sure you will do it well.  Julia X ",

      "Content": "Hi Jen I wrote a reply last night after reading this but lost it so Ill try again. Your post was so familiar to me I had to reply. A cancer diagnosis really does open your eyes to a whole host of stuff you didn't see before. Your husbands remark is likely to be down to one or two things. Men (please bear with me as I am generalizing here based upon my experience. George I don't count you in this he he) generally tick along nicely until something upsets the apple cart. If that something involves emotions then they go into panic mode and cant/wont/don't know how to deal with it. In this case they try and get you to shut up about your diagnosis because he cant or doesn't want to do the touchy feely stuff. Women are much better at that, as we all know. Either that or he really is just plain scared and doesn't know how to protect you and his defense is trying to get you to think that its all done and dusted now and you can go quickly back to life ticking along nicely again. My partner of 8 years supported me through 11 months of treatment but very early on in the diagnosis he would 'get that look' on his face when I talked cancer. It was like, here we go again. I did stop talking to him about BC and used my girlfriends instead. Come the end of treatment my partner changed dramatically towards me ending up with him finishing the relationship. He said he was angry that he hadn't been thanked enough for looking after me. He was also struggling with the fact the past 11 months had been all about me! The end of treatment is a very difficult time. I think you may have to admit that he isn't going t be great at giving you the support you need at the moment but do try and seek that support elsewhere whether its on her or with another close body to you. You could try and discuss how you are feeling with him. You could also try and get him to read the paper below: www.cancercounselling.org.uk/After the Treatment - Peter Harvey.pdf Its a worthwhile read for anyone moving on. All the best. Julia x",

      "Content": "Hi LJB234  breast cancers are tested to see if they have receptors for three things. Oestrogen, progesterone and her2. The majority of bc are ER+ which means hormonal therapies after treatment are given over 5/10 years to prevent recurrence. if you are also or only her2 positive it means you have herceptin which is given in conjunction with chemo. if you test negative for all three you have triple negative BC which there are no preventative drugs for just chemo. Some diagnosis can be triple positive too.  So depending on your type you will get a different preventative drug or not as in the case of TNBC.  Are you er+? If you were her 2 positive you would be having chemo. With ER+ the oncotype dx test is more frequently carried out to see scientifically how likely you would gain a benefit from chemo. It can bring grey areas however and that's a tough call. love Julia x ",

Not to be the bearer of doom and gloom but TNBC tends to come back as secondary in other organs rather than bones unlike ER+ BC.  I had a sore rib after treatment that had lasted for some months. I mentioned it to my oncologist...  More than once until he referred me for a bone scan. It came back fine. apparently the GCSF injections can cause this niggle. There could be a million and one reasons for back pain. I'm a long distance runner so aches and pains are normal to me and I sort that out with regular physio/massage.  Ice packs on the site site 3/4 times a day can help. having a massage can help. Specific stretching exercises can help but I do suggest if this continues for another month then you go back to her oncologist or GP. First though I would try and get your wife to self help with the back pain. I have a very dodgy back that goes around every 3 months but I can get it better in around 4 days after through Ice and exercise. All the best..... It's great to hear your wife is through treatment.

      "Content": "Hi Isingbass No specific diet will keep you cancer free. The reason why there is so much conflicting information out there is quite simply as nothing is 100% proven. Cancer books sell and anyone can write a book claiming to have the key to staying cancer free.  I don't believe there are any adults out there that don't know what a 'healthy' diet looks like. The trick is being strong enough to make changes and stick by them. Ultimately  you need to find your own way And find what is realistic for you. As you have found out with the vegan diet, if it doesn't suit your lifestyle then you are more likely to quit.  Excercise is key because with a minimum of 2.5 hours per week you have leeway with your diet. Protein is essential for weight loss and so are good fats (Avocado, nuts etc) Low fat diets are the worse because you end up substituting with high sugar and very manufactured products. Eating over 5 portions of fruit and veg per day is key. Protein at every meal is essential (chicken being one of the best sources) and small carb portions after exercise. I drink green tea at least twice per day, eat oily fish at least twice per week and take glucosamine daily as I excercise a lot.  I alternative between non dairy and dairy. Again I eat dairy because of the protein.  You will know when you've got the right balance when you are happy with your dress size, and feel like you are doing all you can to keep 'healthy' without feeling guilty when you have the odd treat! Tackling comfort eating is tricky because the underlying cause needs treating first. Get that nailed then there's no stopping you.  Julia X ",

I was very fortunate in that I had neoadjuvant chemo and had a pathological complete response so I can say it was worth every sodding ache and pain! And there were many. However I'm two years post chemo and have no lasting side effects.  Ive seen what an amazing job chemo can do but it doesn't happen all the time. With or without chemo you aren't guaranteed to never develop secondary BC but by having chemo you are less likely to. You are monitored closely on chemo so I'd like to think there would be less chance of long term SE such as neuropathy. But it is a risk.  Im 2.5 years away from diagnosis and took all the treatment I was offered to satisfy my mind that being TNBC I needed to move on from this knowing I've done all I can to help prevent this thing coming back.  This is a hard decision to make but unique to you. There are many many of us here who have lived through chemo to tell the tales.  Love Julia x",

Getting help early is key before it affects the whole arm. Massage helps but you need to know how to massage.

Your iron levels will be low as chemo sees to that. I ended up having transfusions due to anemia. Only in time will  these levels start returning to normal - 4 weeks isn't long enough to be back to 'normal' levels. Skin, hair and nail supplements are worth trying. I used these until my nails grew back. I also had regular head massages with oil. My chemo regime finished with 3 taxol which doesn't cause hair loss like an all FEC regime would.  If you had all FEC? then this is a big dose of the stuff that makes your hair fall out. Julia",

      "Content": "Hi Skye01  Nothing like a cancer diagnosis to bring out the worst  in people. I don think it would be helpful for me to say how unsupportive/unhelpful your family sound as they are still family at the end of the day and a cancer diagnosis shakes things up. I almost get the impression you are being blamed for this diagnosis as its upsetting your Mum's day to day life. Your Mum sounds like she has a lot of control over everyone.... a little too much. I would take the rearranging of the party to a date not suitable for you (her child) as an insult. You are only 70 years old once after all. Two options : Go to the meeting and be hard and fast with what help you require. Go with the list (as long as your bleedin arm if need be) and leave it to them to provide the support you need. Say that you will only accept the help when it is given UNCONDITIONALLY and without a second thought. If they need to think twice then forget it. Or Keep your distance during this time. Leave it until treatment is done and dusted. Being in hospital gives you too much time to think... which isn't great. The realty is you may never need be admitted again so you wont need help for that scenario. You may find if you withdraw then they will realise they have gone to far. Are they use to you doing what they want you to do? Stand firm. I had a similar problem with my mum, as you know, but I found my support from other sources until I didn't need it. Then I felt I couldn't be bothered to revisit it and it was all  brushed under the carpet. Incidentally I am now closely then ever to my Mum. Cancer is Cr%) Hugs Julia xx PS If all else fails..... print out this thread and post it too your family :)",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah  use the previous 3 sessions of chemo as an indication of what SE your mum is having. After chemo number two I had a good idea of what I would feel on what day and when I would start to feel better.  On the basis your mum hasn't had any cycles delayed or postponed it means her body has recovered enough to go into another cycle. If something nasty was up it would show in her blood test results.  I am in my early 40's yet would be in bed for three-four days post each FEC. With taxol I become poorly from day 3/4. As long as she is monitoring her temperature and reports any high temp which indicates sepsis then that's the best you can do.  Chemo is incredibly hard going. If mum is at the end of her tether or it looks like her long term health is being affected, as chloecat says, discuss this with oncology but if they are saying what's she experiencing is 'normal', that's what you go on. ",

If your iron levels were too low whilst you were having chemo you would have been told as it would have shown up in your blood test results. Mine went too low  and that was why I ended up with a transfusion. I used a normal massage oil (base oil) and coconut oil. Superdrug do a very good one in a tub which is a good price. You have to rub it in your hands to soften it before use. I think if you had had FEC first your hair would be starting to grow very soon. Its the red chemical in FEC that makes you hair fall out.",

Lean on the other men in your life. It sounds like you need to be having words first. As George says, in sickness and in health. I hate being stereotypical but men do need things spelt out sometimes.  I'm not married but have a partner of 8 years. At the end of treatment he expected me in sexy lingerie and the whole works. Jeez that was the last thing on my mind. I had zero confidence and the thought of sex made me panic. I was giving off bad vibes which in turn my partner took as me not fancying him anymore. It was a vicious circle which ended up with no sex and us both feeling unattractive. He took to watching porn which added to insult. I took all the blame until counselling made me realise there are two people in a relationship so a problem with one is a problem with both and both of you should be working at it to get back on track.  You may not feel strong enough now to deal with the relationship side or you may feel to get the most out of those close to you you need to be heard before your surgery.  some breast care units run support groups for partners. all the best julia ",

TNBC isn't always Grade 3. I had Grade 2 cancer which is slower growing. The trouble with TNBC is that Googling it will give you a grim picture. Its not always that way. I am 3.5 years post diagnosis and its looking good. One positive with TNBC is that is that if you manage 5 years without it coming back, after that, statistically your survival rates are better than that of ER positive BC. Your Grand mother could well see 100 years old :) All the best for surgery. Chemo is grueling - the risks at 94 will more than likely outweigh the positives. Love Julia xx",

Its probably one of the most common illnesses. 1 in 2 of us. Must of us will have had grandparents that died of cancer if not parents. I lost a grandparent to throat cancer and can honestly say it was horrible so my opinion of cancer was influenced by what had gone on before. My 9 year old daughter got loads of support from her school. One of her classmates had gone through treatment for leukaemia so her school was very proactive. They took part in Wig Wednesday to raise awareness and raise money they also invited kids to speak in assembly to share their experiences. My daughter was praised for the way she outwardly coped with my cancer. I couldn't fault the school for supporting her.  As a child it's as scary as hell when an adult who you are close too gets ill.  It really would be great if you could share your experience of cancer with your nieces peers. But only you will know when the times right.  love Julia xx ",

      "Content": "Hello  No need to feel a fraud here.  Sorry to read about your gran and mum. It's unusual due to your grans age on diagnosis that she was tested for the Brca gene mutation. Was there family history further back than your gran or a reason why she was tested?  I was tested as diagnosed at 41 years with BC with a family history but it was negative.  It's down to you whether you seek to get tested. You don't have to do it. The opera guide is the first step then if your GP/specialist feels it needs to be taken further you then need to fill out paperwork which asks all about family history of cancer types and other illnesses. It would be at this point the info you supply is checked against databases and in your case would confirm you gran has the Brca gene mutation. You do get counselling before the test as you need to be fully aware of what a positive result would mean for you.  As already stated you have a 50% chance of a positive result but even a positive result doesn't automatically mean you will definately get BC due to the gene mutation.  If you feel you need to do it then seek assistance but maybe it's not something your mum needs to know your doing or it may not be worth persuing testing for your mum at this time. She might be worried that if she was tested and positive then that would affect you. Ontop of all she is going through its another hurdle for her. It's a complex situation.  Whatever you decide, I hope it's a positive outcome. ",

You run the risk of it affecting your mental state big time and dealing with cancer is enough in its itself.  you knew from diagnosis this was going to be s challenge getting support. You've been vocal about what you need but they can't come up trumps for you. Don't put yourself in any more situations that will lead you to question what you are doing wrong. You aren't, the family just aren't getting it. Time to walk. Protect yourself. Even if it's until the end of treatment. While they affect you you will question everyone around you because you are volnurable. Folk will stare at bald heads the same they stare at disabilities, obese prople and so on. It's not a personal thing (unless your family have gossiped to them). hair loss is temporary. It doesn't feel like it and I'm not saying it will feel any less temporary tomorrow but in a year it will be in the past.  Clear your head and that I think means clearing the family.  Failing that, voodoo dolls??!!! sending hugs and all the best for chemo.

I counted every single day off the calendar through chemo it felt like I was literally living to get to the end of chemo treatment, that in itself made me feel bad because I was wishing time away.  For me chemo was the most 'challenging' shall we say. Your appearance changes drastically , your head gets mashed and your body fries from the inside.  I have to say however, 5 months down the road I feel great and look back and think It really wasn't that bad. I know deep down it was but it's amazing when you get through stuff how your mind tells you it was all ok in the end.  Be proud of how you are getting through this. Have faith in your body and you mustnt feel guilty about how you are feeling reflecting on others. I have a 10 year old and I started by hiding a lot from her. Then I found I couldn't but we carried on. She knew what was going on and she loved and cared for me in her own way.  Chemo is literally a means to an end to breast cancer. Without a doubt the hardest thing I have done . Be proud. Two more sessions Wooooppppeeeee. The finish post is in sight xxx",

There's also the risk of neotrophenic sepsis which was included in my treatment plan as a possible cause of me dying if I got it. You lose hair, nails, confidence and feel crap. The bottom line is that even if you had chemo you can never be certain that it will prevent recurrence. There are no guarantees.  I think they can still zap your axilla with RT as well as the breast so it may be worth exploring. All the prediction tools I have seen give higher benefits to RT than they do to chemo.  Julia xxx",

The difficulty with hair that's always been chemically lightened is that the chemicals in these products are a lot harsher than say browns.. Have a look at the following website. I found it fab. The way forward maybe is to  find a hairdresser that has been specifically trained by Trevor Sorbie's 'My new hair' initiative rather than take risks with a hairdresser looking for a safe limit of peroxide. http://www.mynewhair.org/support-advice/ Spray in root control colours are ideal.

I had lobular bc and am wondering why you want to have the bilateral MX because of this alone? lobular is more likely to appear in more than one place on diagnosis but if thats not the case with you then it's treated as any other BC. I don't think lobular is a strong enough argument for a MX alone In a healthy breast. I had a WLE.  Surgeons and more importantly anaesthetists won't take risks. By saying it's too risky to operate they are saying you are at risk of dying If you have this type of surgery. It's a hard one to argue. Are you willing to take that risk if you had the opportunity? Surgeons are also very reluctant to remove good breasts.  You could seek another surgeons opinion but again if you were to find one who would operate would you take the risk? Being told we can't have what we would like is hard but in a few days/weeks when you have had time to process this information you may feel differently.  Ask how much you would need to lower your BMI before they would consider recon as you may think that's doable? I would say take time to really consider the professional opinion. love Julia x ",

I too would be very peed of with the Nurse. being told your cancer free and then being told you have your chest wall affected are at different ends of the spectrum. How can those two conclusions come from the same set of patient notes. I think to be safe you need to find out where the nurse was coming from, just in case someone is wrong here. Surgery always comes with a warning that they may find more than first suspected. that's why surgery is still the best course of action. This is especially the case with finding out how many nodes are affected.  The cells tested would have been grade 2 and 3. The stage of your BC, does it remain at stage 2 or has it been changed following the chest wall involvement?  There are ladies on here that are diabetic and have had chemo. I'm hoping they will come along soon. The bottom line I guess though is what your oncologist feels is right for you? Is your BC ER+? You will be offered hormonal therapies so there are more options out there along with radiotherapy.  Hopefully the PET scan will happen soon and you won't be kept waiting for results.

Triple neg and her2 also respond very well to chemo. Not all BC respond well to chemo and if you have adjuvant chemo there are will be no indicators that chemotherapy is working or not working.  I had chemo purely as I was triple negative and without it my prognosis was not good. Now Knowing what chemo does to you,  if I was given statistical info based on my specific set of circumstances that gave a very low benefit of chemo I would not go through it again.  Trust the oncotype test and be guided by the oncologist. Chemo isn't something to take without any assurance it will be of benefit to you because the SE will far outweigh this.  All the best X   ",

Regardless of how active you are, a high BMI puts you at risk. Lowering that will give multiply  benefits but now isn't really a good time to be actively dieting or exercising.  Any surgeon worth their salts will do their upmost to get a good cosmetic appearance.

Take the initial opinion of the medics as what has gone on...... you have had infections. You have been extra unlucky that you have had a few. Your immune system wont be working at full capacity since all the treatment for BC, couple that with you returning to work and being in close contact with germs your body has picked things up that it would normally fight off without you knowing about. The infection in your breast could be something to do with the surgical site. The scan has been suggested to rule out a recurrence dont think of it as being sought to confirm a recurrence. I dont take hormonal suppressors so cant say whether the infections are common with herceptin and tamofixen but other ladies might be able to share similar experiences. Its good you are being seen next week and you can be guided by the radiographers/consultants on what they see in the scans. All the best next week x",

I am so sorry to read about what your wife is going through. When you say she had non hormonal BC do you mean she is triple negative or her2 positive? She must have had so much treatment.  I can totally understand why you feel you cope better at work.

Please bear in mind that we have all had a breast cancer diagnosis so may speak as if you have already had a  diagnosis. However, we are jumping the gun as you haven't been given the results yet. Its not a done deal that its cancer. Saying that, it will be very tough for you tomorrow if you decide to go it alone. Do you have a close friend you can take. My mind went after I heard the words cancer. I cant tell you what happened after that but my partner was there taking on board all the info. I don't even know what to say to you regarding questions as you may find you don't want to know anything initially. We also run the risk of overloading you causing even more anxiety at this stage. My advice is see what tomorrow brings. Take someone supportive and do come back to us when you know what is what. If it is cancer, its very very treatable and has one of the highest treatment success rates. You wont believe this at first but you learn to accept this. I was 41 on diagnosis that was almost 2 years ago. Julia xx",

A surgeons knive isn't the solution for curing anxiety. As Helen says, as harsh as it sounds, removing breasts has no bearing on not developing secondary BC. What would happen if you had a bilateral mastectomy then hated the cosmetic results afterwards and found your anxiety was still there?  Speak with your GP as it sounds like you aren't able to live a normal life because of this fear.

Successfully treated and back living lots of lovely life. Breast cancer is very treatable without sounding flippant.  however, that doesn't lessen the shock and your world crashing around your ears temporarily. You feel bad for the hurt your causing and I can guarantee your family feel ten times worse in that this is happening to you.  Every twinge, cough, sneeze, twitch you will associate it to the cancer. In your head it's everywhere. It's really not the case. BC more often than not grows over a long period of time. I had to have three body scans before starting treatment and they were the worse results to wait for. Getting the clear results made me think phew only primary BC to deal with. Perverse but t needed all the positives I could get.  At the moment until you get all the results from scans and the type of BC you have you cant start treatment. When you do start treatment it's head down and off you go. Throughout my dianosis I always used a mental pair of scales in my head. One side negatives, one positives and the positive side was always heaviest. That got me through. All the best for the scans. So let us know how you get on and when you can start treatment and remember its very treatable. Julia X ",

But of course you need to see him.  Are you able to say to your sister when you are feeling volnurable that you can't listen to her just at that moment And maybe the conversation can be postponed until another time.  learning to live after cancer is actually quite if not very hard and it won't be smooth going. Be gentle and concentrate on the here and now. Looking back or too far in the future isn't good.  You've done so great since your DX.

The information in the leaflet given says that there is no evidence to suggest that having bloods etc taken from an affected side makes your risk of lymphedema any higher. However the caveat is when they are done 'IN A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT'. I have questioned this as to be honest , I get most of my bloods taken/BP done at my GP surgery by a nurse. That technically isn't a hospital environment so I am not sure where they are coming from on that basis. Do they consider surgeries less aseptic than hospitals? This isn't me saying we should all adhere to this advice but I was interested to know if its a national thing or local thing? To be honest its difficult to know what advice to trust? Or is it just me? It is good news however for people that have had clearance on both sides etc. Incidentally the leaflet that I was sent had the web link to the Macmillan fact sheet about lymphoedema. I looked at this and couldn't see any advice saying avoid bloods/injections etc from an affected arm. Love Julia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Poohbear44  Congratulations on getting the finishing post in sight. It's a tough one Isnt it. i don't have experience of hormonal therapies as I'm triple negative so there's nothing I can take to prevent recurrence. Taking a drug that has side effects (as all drugs do) to prevent recurrence  in my eyes is worth a shot. Try it at least. I do know many ladies that take hormonal therapies and can say this. Those that were a healthy weight and fairly active before bc dont put on weight as they maintain their healthy lifestyle. Those that were overweight and have tended to be up until their BC diagnosis do put on more weight.  The pills themselves aren't calorie loaded but it's how they make you feel when suppressing oestrogen. You might not feel like being active, you might feel a bit achy so you make bad choices with food to feel better. Then it becomes a viscous cycle.  Any diets work with 100% willpower. That's the hard bit. Being good all the time is flipping hard! Dieting alone won't give you the results that diet and excercise will give. If you are content with how you look now I would say give the tamoxifen a go.  im a healthy weight and very active but do the 5:2 diet as it suits my lifestyle and I like having two days per week where I control calorie intake.  Your BC unit will have access to diet advice. I was also given advice e by a dietitian at a moving on session. To be honest though it's pretty generic advice. We all know what are healthy choices. There is lots of evidence that says being overweight increases your risk with ER+ BC.  Exercise makes you feel great after and you continue to burn calories well after the session.  I'm a big advocate of exercise because if you get that right you will find you don't have to worry about dieting. i do appreciate its daunting but please do take on board other ladies experience of weight loss such as Kacang. It's an truely inspirational example. Good luck and all the best Julia x",

I'm sorry to hear you think your diagnosis will affect a 30 year marriage ( I'm in awe of thirty years!).  My 8 year relationship with my partner went downhill during and after treatment but is now on its way back on track. I had 5 months of counselling. My partner is also someone who thinks counselling is a waste of time. It angers me because he's never tried it even though he fought in the Falklands and has major baggage. Some men are just to stubborn and short sighted. However that's not a reason why you should not have counselling. Counselling is to help you back on track. Part of that counselling will be talking about your relationship and youll get help with coping strategies. Do this for you. You can always try and come back from counselling and drip feed to your husband what happens at counselling, he might become more receptive when he sees the benefit you are getting. A happy wife is worth their weight in gold or so I am told!  All the best with it. My counselling was a life saver .  Julia ",

What response have you had to chemo? or what response do they think you have had? If it looks like you have had a complete response then time isn't critical. I waited 10 weeks between chemo and surgery but it was confirmed I had  a PCr. The other point is as you say, when you are fit for surgery. Bearing in mind though that there was only three weeks between chemo cycles, your body could be ready for surgery in 4 weeks or so. I would say, don't be in a rush if your consultant isn't as the long recovery in between is ideal. I coped with surgery really well as I had 10 weeks to get fighting fit again. It is a little concerning however that you haven't talked to your surgeon to go through surgery options. You need to be guided by him. Do you have an appointment with him soon? Assuming you have finished chemo now? Love Julia x",

Nothing was checked regarding the BC side.  You do need to find out what surgery your surgeon is performing on Monday as if you are undecided then he obviously doesn't know that and the type needs agreeing now. It will be too last minute Monday. You will see your surgeon pre op but that shouldn't be the time to agree what type of surgery you are having. You will also be required to sign to say what op it is and agree to the risks involved. My surgery was agreed weeks before I had it. I met with my surgeon three times before I agreed on surgery.  Have you actually met your surgeon yet? I agree with you totally this seems too last minute. I hope it gets sorted tomorrow x",

I would take it as a good thing in your situation because the test proved u you benefit. Not having chemo would have put you at more risk. there are bad side affects and there are bad side effects! If your oncologist thought the effects you were having we're life threatening or changing he would stop it. Whilst they feel awful se to you and indeed did  to me they are 'normal'. I had fECT and was hospitalised twice after becoming septic and had UTIs and recurring thrush amongst a whole host of effects. All of which I recovered very well from.  chemo is horrid but it has to be more powerful than cancer hence the effects. Hang on in there it will come to an end. Do remember to have over two litres of water/liquid per day. That will help with the UTI. Julia X  ",

Do you think more would be useful?  The emotional fallout of a cancer diagnosis is quite often referred to as similar to PTSD that's why your quick fix counselling may not have been enough especially as you are so far on from your diagnosis now.  Have you tried the Macmillan helpLine?

However the oncotype test is a good test and the theory behind it is to give some scientific evidence behind what chemo can do for you. Ultimately you have to make the decision based upon how you feel, not how your husband feels. He's probably scared for you because chemo does affect you dramatically, albeit temporarily And he's probably unsure on how you will cope. I was so scared having Tnbc that I would have done anything to not go through a recurrence. At 41 years I was not planning on leaving a 9 year old child. You could say it was easier for me as I had little choice however with an 8% decrease in risk i would take it. If you decide not to take it it's a decision you have to be at peace with in the future.  I am 20 months post chemo and dont have any long term side effects. I did go into chemo however very fit. I have managed to get back to that level of fitness but it all takes time.  i think you need to say to your husband he should just say he will support you either way. Anyone not faced with a decision like this can't possibly offer an informed opinion because it's your cancer, your body and your future and chemo is very powerful.  All the best Julia X ",

Sorry to read that rt wasn't kind to you especially after the flap surgery.  It sounds like you have taken good control of the letrozole decision. It did its job pre surgery but as you say, the SE now aren't worth it. Good on you.  I too have found I will never be the same but realise as the months roll by that I actually like what I have changed into. Yes I'm rough around the edges but there are many things I have learnt about myself that are positives. This applies to you too Heather. You have shown courage and patience, such patience with the letrozole. I can say from your posts you are a very gentle and compassionate human being and I do really wish you all the very best.  For me, counselling was equally if not more important than the conventional treatment. I had sessions over 5 months starting 6 weeks after I finished RT and it helped so much. My head is in the space it needs to be in to enjoy life again. And enjoy life I do.  Take care Heather.

I had odema in the breast only and just like you, found wearing compression vests made me feel worse than the odema itself and did absolutely nothing to help. I didn't find my lymphoedema clinic very helpful. After using kinesio tape after 6 weeks I saw results. This was last August. The tape stays good for up to 5 days before it needs reapplying depending upon how sticky it stays. I use Rocktape. I used a cheap alternative but it made me itch like crazy.  im now discharged from the lymphoedema clinic now as the odema has gone. I get occasional 'flare' ups where I use tape for 3-5 days then it goes. I massage/moisturise each night wich takes minutes.  I run upto  15 miles a week and it's ok with a decent sports bra.  My experience with clinics is that they tend to let the odema get worse before they move on to taping!  In my opinion I would look at having it now before it gets worse. I'm certainly glad mine was nipped in the bud so to speak. Julia X ",

She also happened to be trained in manual drainage and taping. In Holland taping is done very early on. To be honest once you know how the tape needs to be applied you can do it yourself  With the help of a partner. I buy Rocktape. The tape is cut into tails and placed into certain positions. The idea being it lifts the skin to allow better drainage. I did self massage daily and used the tape for around 2/3 Months. I no longer need it. Some lymphoedema clinics do offer it but they tend to wait until symptoms are servere before they offer it. Some sports therapists are used to kinesio taping but you need to check they can use it for oedema. Google vodder specialists in your area because they are also often trained in taping.  Try searching images on kinesio taping for odema in the arm and that will give you an idea of what it looks like.  Julia X ",

      "Content": "Hi T smith  Courses of chemo are standard. You won't get more or less than standard unless of course you have such a dangerous reaction it has to be stopped. This applies whether you have chemo adjuvantly or neoadjuvantly.  Having chemo first gives the benefit of seeing it work on the tumour. As already described here, if you have a pCR (pathological complete response) then your prognosis is better than if you still have residual cells. However there is also the worry that you don't get such a good result. Triple neg and her2 BC responds better to chemo. I was TNBC and had a pcr. In my case it was chemo that worked the best.  If you have surgery first and your nodes are affected or you have vascular invasion or a large tumour/multiple sites you would be recommended for chemo. There are no good measures to see if chemo taken adjuvantly has done anything. You only hope that any cells that may be hiding out somewhere in your body are found and destroyed but you can't measure that. In which case you would have the prescribed amount of sessions ( norm is 6). Courses are normally broken into two as you switch drugs half way through. Different drugs work in different ways. So you would need everything to complete the process.  Some people have weekly sessions rather than 3 weekly due to pre existing medical conditions that could be made worse by chemo.  It is common however for doses to be lowered if you have severe side effects. That happened to me.  I wish you all the best with it if you end up going down that route.  Julia X ",

The further you get away from it the less fearful you become.  My diagnosis (TNBC) was 17 months ago. I had neoadjuvant  chemo, WLE axilla clearance and 15 RT sessions. Got through it all pretty unscathed although initially there were many dark moments however it all fell apart when the treatment finished. I had 11 months away from the office. ive just finished 5 months of counselling and a 6 week 'moving on' course. Both have been lifesavers and I feel fantastic now. I really do. Life is back on track and better in some ways. I always wonder if triple neg ladies are hit harder by the psychological effects purely as we have had the Unknown breast cancer. And to be honest you generally find people talk about triple neg very negatively! I no longer fear TNBC . I can't change it and actually we have positive things about TNBC.  If you find your pyschological state stops you functioning day to day, do seek help. Your BC unit can arrange it.  This time last year I was having my last chemo. I remember watching my 9 year old in a carnival and openly wept the whole way through. Every time I looked at her it was overwhelming. Those feelings are no longer a year on.  Julia x",

It's one of many things on a long long list of things that can happen when you have a cancer diagnosis.  If you do find yourself staring up at the ceiling and finding your mind in dark places, distract it. Get up and distract it until you are calm again. There are some good ideas on here already.   As humans we like to make sense of things of things and at the moment nothing is making sense hence the feeling of no control. We all like structure and to be in control. You have to accept that just for a while you will be told what you have to do and you follow instructions and you will have to do whatever you body needs to do just to get through treatment. It's a short price to pay if it gives you many many years left on this earth. At 41years I willing said it would be 12 months out of my life and I gave it. Now I'm well out of of the tunnel and life is very bright again.  I had 11 months away from the office and kept thinking during treatment I want to get back. I have now been back at work for five months and guess what..........I now realise that I enjoyed my time whilst not working, even though I felt rubbish for some of it, I spent more time with family, friends and my daughter and doing things that made me happy. Work doesn't always Make me happy! Use this time wisely and do things that make you happy. It's well worth it.  The 'what ifs' is a hard one but you will get ontop of it as time moves on. Again I say this in hindsight, but when you are in the midst of treatment you are doing everything possible to get cancer free. The what ifs therefore won't affect treatment and the outcome. You are doing all you can. The hardest part is when treatment stops and you have to trust that body of yours to behave. Let the what ifs go during this time.  Julia x    ",

If you follow this link you will find a great blog on handy and helpful tips.  community.macmillan.org.uk/.../118955 My advice is eat little but often tomorrow and don't eat lots of heavy sweet things. Drink lots and I mean lots of water before and then every day after chemo until you feel better. Be prepared for nausea but it's important to keep eating little and often. Take the anti sickness tabs even if you don't feel sick.  The first chemo is scary but you will be well looked after.  Be gentle on yourself when you get home and sleep as much as you can. Walk daily if you can too. Fresh air is a great healer. All the best for tomorrow. love Julia x ",

My periods returned 5 months after chemo for a few months then went haywire again. I had a blood test and it came back I was peri menopausal. However a month later and ever since i have had very regular periods so am no where near the menopause I'm pleased to say.  as you say, periods returning are a good thing.  Your GP should do a blood test if you want it but they may say it's still early days to see if you are entering into the menopause. You aren't officially through menopause until 12 months of no periods.  Ive had a bone scan since finishing treatment but that was to check out a rib problem. If you have an ailment that needs checking you should get support from your oncologist. Mine is fantastic. I mention a niggle and he deals with it To reassure me. To be honest I rarely see my GP as I'm still seeing surgeon and oncologist 2 years on from diagnosis.  Julia X ",

If you could live with that risk and feel better in the short term then would that be better for you? If you can live with that decision that's all that matters.  Speak with your oncologist and be guided into a decision whether the the current side effects outweigh the risk of recurrence.  It is now 7 months since you spoke to your BCN and you say you are still waiting? On no level is that acceptable. Try the oncologist or if you can face a battle, start shouting more loudly at your BC unit or you will carry on suffering.  All the best.  Julia ",

Too me it sounds like you have tried very hard to resolve these issues but they remain unresolved due to your Mum. You in turn now need to decide to move on from this and leave it all behind. You cannot second guess or even give reasons why she is being like this. To be honest I am not sure it would be helpful even if you did know the reasons. I learnt that parents can act in the strangest way when a child has cancer. I had the same with my mum although now my mum and I never talk about 'things' because I was very angered by her actions when I was going through treatment. I don't blame her now but I just know that she isn't my 'crutch' if and when I need to talk about things. If your mum is damaging your mental state you need to take her out of the picture at present until you get proper help . If you can talk to others about your diagnosis then you don't need to talk to your mum. It feels natural that as children, we go to our parents when we are in trouble. Not all parents find they deal with that pressure 'naturally'. I am guessing she just wants 'things to get back normal' and wishes you would too but ironically she cant see that she is the barrier to you doing this. Due to the length of time that has passed since you have finished treatment It is a good thing you are seeking help. Don't have any expectations from your Mum any more. Talk to your husband and in turn she wont get between you and your husband. Its obvious that your mum is stopping you form 'moving on' and that cant go on.

      "Content": "Hi Apple This can be a worrying time and I know your mind can take over rational thinking and give nothing but negative thoughts, however you need your body to heal after surgery. To do this you need a positive frame of mind. I had counselling between chemo and surgery as my head got totally scrambled over deciding what operation to have. (In hind site it seems ridiculous!) t helped massively. It taught me to look at the positives and negatives and see which outweighs each other. There were always more positives than negatives and that's how I continue to view treatment and moving on.  If you do have some nodes tested as positive how will it have changed your treatment? It probably wouldn't have. If they were positive they are now out of your body along with the cancer cells in your breast. Gone. Radiotherapy/chemo (if u have it) will also be giving added protection.  If you have triple neg Bc you have a higher chance of lymph node involvement. That's how TNBC behaves.  I had two nodes affected but was told this from original biopsie so I always knew from the start.  Your brain is probably telling you that if the nodes have been affected it's more serious.... But that's not the reality.  Here's to a speedy recovery. All the best. Julia. ",

Have you had a post op check yet? Do you have a seroma and/or odema which is causing a problem? Have you got any cording?

It's important for anyone having neoadjuvant chemo to know how different types of BC react to chemo. To compare with others isn't a good thing. Er+ tends not to respond as well as TNBC but the playing field equals out as TNBC doesn't respond to hormonal therapies and er+ responds very well as a preventative drug.  Different chemotherapies work in different ways so not being affected by Doctaxol doesn't mean EC/FEC won't have any affect.  The outcomes of chemo are so broad from complete pathological response, partial response to no response.  If you had chemo after surgery you will never know what affect its had on you so some consider neo adjuvant chemo a better prognosis outcome.  I would definitely say don't be despondent as EC could be the game changer.  Don't feel you've wasted treatment with T because without having it you would have never known what response you could have.  Definately Don't lose hope.

      "Content": "Hi mags  carcinoma is the term for cancer used by professionals. The proper name if you like when the tumour has grown out and away from the milk ducts (invasive) and free to move around the body. Invasive is the type of  breast cancer. The types are invasive lobular or invasive ductal. The other types are ductal carcinoma in Situ (non invasive).   I am surprised your mum hasn't  been given a grade of cancer. My experience was that at the time I had my biopsie they tested the grade (2 in my case) along with hormone receptor status. The grade measures the abnormality of the cells. Grade 3 cells grow more quickly than 2. I was also told during the original ultrasound it looked like 2 lymph nodes were effected. Did they look at your mums nodes when they did an ultrasound when she was first tested? As for stage, if your mum had MRI/bone scan/ct scan before starting chemo they would have known that they were only treating the cancer in her breast. The question is whether they knew at the start if lymph nodes may of been effected. They would also know the approx size of the tumour from an MRI.   Even if you have chemo first, when surgery happens and they look at the lymph nodes (dissection) they can still tell if a node had previously been affected by cancer as it looks diffferent. Also the tissue and nodes removed after surgery are tested to see if there are cancer cells present and if 'clear margins' have been achieved. I didn't get to see my stage until I started radiotherapy but I worked it out to be T2 (stage 2). Hope that helps xx  ",

It wasn't me at all no matter how well I embraced the slap head.  im two years post chemo and my hair length is now where I feel most comfortable. Its weird though seeing the shape of your head isn't it.

I had a 3/8 score which was deemed negative so the term 'weak' may mean it's not the top score but also not to be dismissed. You are still going to get a lot of benefit.

It's unusual not to give warning you are being moved off full pay and they should have given you chance to plan and put forward a return to work plan before SSP commenced.  It sounds too me like they are trying to be sneaky but you need to catch them out on abusing process if you can. All of your meetings (even coffee) should be documented so it sounds easy to prove if they haven't followed procedure.

      "Content": "Hi Matt Glad to hear the chemo end is in sight. I was also triple negative and had neo adjuvant chemo too. When you say treatment is coming to an end, if I've read things correctly she has surgery and possible RT to go yet? therefore she's only1/3 of the way through so still lots to be done to get rid of anything that may be left. Its very difficult for an oncologist to predict how a tumour will react to chemo. I am a big advocate of having chemo first but there is always the risk that you expect better results than what actually happens. However, I will say this. At the end of chemo I couldn't feel my tumour but was told to expect when they did the WLE that there was every possibility they could discover more tumour that was hiding. This panicked me.  It wasn't until after I had a very good WLE (my breast has very little scaring and is still very similar to the other) I had the pathological results to say that I had had a complete response to chemo. There were no cells left in either my breast or the one affected lymph node. You are right, previous cancer in lymph nodes causes scaring but it may be that the cancer cells are gone. You wont know until after surgery. I went into a complete state of panic after chemo as I waited 10 weeks for surgery. In the end it made no difference to the outcome but at the time I automatically thought the worse. Its perfectly normal to be feeling these negative thoughts again but do stress to your wife, chemo has worked but until after surgery you wont know how well, surgery will be good in terms of minimal tissue being removed meaning your wife will hopefully be left with a decent breast shape still. and then you have RT which is belt and braces treatment. Hopefully you will get a date for surgery soon which will help the anxiety. Julia x",

I know many ladies that have had a recall after post BC mammograms. mammograms are designed to pick things up early stages that's why they are important. Keep that in your mind... Early stages. Many of the women I know have gone on to have biopsys that have turned out to be nothing sinister. Because something has been seen it has to be acted upon. You've had BC once so are more at risk of a recurrence agsinst someone who hasn't had a diagnosis. We have to View the follow up we get as a positive. I'd never had a mammogram on diagnosis which meant my tumour was quite large before  felt it. How I wish the screening age was lowered.  Hormonal therapies do reduce your risk of recurrence that's why you get to take them. They are better than not taking anything to prevent recurrence.  Everything can still be lovely today, tomorrow and until the next tests. You are preempting something you have no way of knowing yet.  It has every reason to turn out to be nothing but if it isnt, remember early diagnosis is good. You will know what's what in the week. weekends are precious with children. Make the most of them.  My fingers are crossed for you. julia X ",

You can dye it anytime as long as you do a patch test and that goes ok. I had my hair dyed at the hairdressers 5 months post chemo which went really well and in hindsight I wish I had done it much earlier as my grey hair really got to me. Just bear in mind that hair is more fragile after chemo. It can take months and months to get back to how it was.  What type Of dye you use again is personal choice. Hair colours have not been linked to BC (see CRuk site) but natural dyes have less harshness in them. I use Paul Mitchell colour, done by a hairdresser.  Personally , I needed my hairdressers advice on how to manage my new crop of tight curls!  It made so much difference to me having my hair coloured and styled (I say styled loosely as there wasn't much styling to be done!).  Julia ",

The reality is the surgeon will be the one who would have treated you via the NHS.  I saved my money and did all the things I needed to do on my house. We all have visions of our BC taking over our bodies within days but it doesn't happen like this. Waiting 31 days for treatment to start isn't detrimental.  I can't fault the treatment/care I received through the NHS. You need to be sure that going down the private route will give you a better outcome than the NHS route and proving that will be very hard.  All the best for tomorrow Julia ",

Youve had good BP results pre chemo so that's your norm.I don't think there is much in our bodies that remain 'normal' during chemo.  Your bp is taken regularly so it will be kept an eye on. your oncolgist will get involved if there's a perceived problem.

Your family breast/ovarian/prostrate history is considered and if you are considered at risk you can apply for testing. The downside is that it takes  months which is why you should ask now about it.  If you are found positive for the Brca gene mutation a bilateral mastectomy is normally recommended for risk reduction reasons.  Talk it over with your consultant .   ",

To be honest that is my preferred way to be dealt with because I can't do wishy washy touchy-feely but like u say you need to find someone you are comfortable with. Give it a while longer just to see when the shock does lessen a bit to see if you start warming to the consultant. Ultimately you can choose your surgeon. Our unit had two surgeons. Where are you in the country?  Because of your family history I really would suggest you talk to someone regarding a Brca mutation gene test as ultimately that could determine the type of surgery you have. This needs to be discussed soon.  All the best x",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona Im not going to be much help to you as I had clearance at the same time as a WLE and that was after chemo.  When you say they removed 8, 2 of which were cancerous why are they saying you need more surgery if 6 removed weren't cancerous? I had 1 node affected and 11 removed as that was the cluster around the one affected. I think RT to the lymph area would be after many more nodes were affected Or if nodes are only slightly affected but don't warrant being removed.  If you think we have around 22 lymph nodes ish around this area sometimes they can all be affected In my more advanced Cases. To be honest if I were you I would be asking if the removal of all lymph nodes is necessary as you already had a safety net of 6 Clear. Having all nodes removed means you have the lymphoedema risk.  I had RT 8 weeks post surgery and it made my lymphoedema in the breast worse. Bearing in mind I had surgery to the breast also. RT to the lymph area heightens the risk of lymphoedema in the arm But then you are already at risk with nodes having been removed.  lit might be a case of swings and roundabouts but do ask if more surgery is absolutely necessary. Node clearance doesn't always mean they have to remove every single node.  Julia X ",

It doesn't often happen but complications can get in the way.  Your team will need you to be as fit as possible with a immune system raring to go for chemo. If your body is fighting infection still it's not ready. Chemo cant be taken lightly and if you start too soon you risk bigger side effects. Instead of asking when you can start, ask your oncologist how long you can be left before chemo can start and still be of benefit. I think you'll be surprised And find you still have a good window. I had chemo first and waited over ten weeks for surgery after. 5 weeks Post op is still recent. Try and eat for boosting your immune system and gentle walks where you can.

It can mean a poorer prognosis.  The chemo regime asks if you had a second and third generation chemo. Third generation is usually a Taxane. If you were to have Fec t for example that's second and third generation. As you say though it's making little difference.  the stats are showing chemo and hormonal therapies will give little benefit. I would imagine because you are grade 1. Your survival stats without chemo and hormonal treatment are good.  Definitely a discussion point when your oncologists give their opinion on both hormonal treatments and chemo. Julia xx",

You haven't said what receptor status you are? As you've had chemo already I'm guessing you are her2+ or triple neg?  if the oncologist thinks it necessary you my get body scans again. We all envisage cancer cells growing at the speed of notts but it's not the case . realistically the rest of your body won't have been affected between the original scans and now.  Only going back to your onc will really answer the questions in your head.  Try to box these thoughts up until Monday and seek advice then. do all the things you had planned this weekend in the meantime.  Julia x  ",

No cancer consultant can guarantee any of your treatment is a forever cure. it's the risk we have to live with unfortunately. It's not just chemo but applies to surgery and RT too. However I was one of the fortunate ones who had a complete response to chemo. Therefore I am led to believe that puts me in good stead and I consider chemo for me was a complete success. That doesn't mean I will never get secondary bc. I've had 2.5 years to accept this. Life is full of risks. Yes we are more likely to be affected by cancer again because we have already been affected but it doesn't mean it WILL happen to us. its true what Macmillan say..  many more people are living with cancer and surviving. compared to ten years ago I'm glad I got treated recently.  With regard to the wait between surgery and chemo it will depend on if you are recovered enough. it can be anything from 4 to 8 weeks Or longer.  Have you spoken to your Gp about how this is mentally affecting you as you may benefit from some help such as medication.  Take care Julia x ",

I was stage 2.  Is everyone sure how many nodes are affected at this stage? That may make a difference.  I asked to be copied into all correspondence that was written about me and that was where I learnt the most about my diagnosis.  To be honest I learnt as time went on and treatment happened, the stage became less relevant. The grade for me was more prevailant.  Julia x",

Be extra cautious however with your hand washing. The very thought of 35 kids in my house puts me in a spin. Saying that if it's no hassle having it at your mums then let her take some pressure off. If that helps you?  i think you need to be asking why the treatment plan looks like it's changing regarding rt. It's probably nothing sinister but often you find consultants have a differing opionIon. A radiologist will always want you to have rt. The decision to have/not have RT however shouldn't influence the here and now with the party.  Have  a wonderful party, whatever you decide. Julia X ",

I use to think I could feel the chemo rushing through my body it felt like waves and it was awful. You should be due to see your oncologist? My doses were changed after the first FEC (I was hospitalized) and first Docetaxel. It will be your oncologists call on whether the side effects you are having are 'normal' or not. If they are too severe then a reduced dose would be the way to go. Despite me feeling absolutely awful my oncologist would praise me all the time on how well I coped! Hang on in there.

I totally get that we live each day preciously as none of us know what is around the corner but when I was first diagnosed with TNBC it was such a 'bigie' now treatment is finished I can't get any consultant to talk about it.

Post chemo was the first time I had seen my hair colour 'au naturel' in about 25 years! Quite shocking. My hair is shoulder length now and the regrowth now doesn't look so curly but the ends are. Who knows how long it will stay... You will find that you just morph into style and style with post chemo hair. Try products too tame it and funk it up a bit and experiment with colour. The back does grow quicker than the rest and above the ears which makes it look worse. I'm better with hair though. Would never want to go back there :( Julia X",

Are they scanning your whole body?  On diagnosis as I had lobular cancer with an affected node I had a Ct and bone scan to check that the cancer wasn't elsewhere. I went on to have an MRI but purely to scan both breasts, again as I was lobular. That wasn't so bad as you go into the scanner feet first, lie tummy side down with boobs placed into baskets! Nice image huh.  I wonder if you could have a Ct scan instead? It is less claustrophobic than the MRI scanner but still may not be great for you? It's worth asking if there is an alternative.   ",

I'm 20 months post chemo and it grew back curly whereas it was straight before. Don't worry to much about the colour as it can be coloured. Post chemo was the first time I had seen my hair colour 'au naturel' in about 25 years! Quite shocking. My hair is shoulder length now and the regrowth now doesn't look so curly but the ends are. Who knows how long it will stay... You will find that you just morph into style and style with post chemo hair. Try products too tame it and funk it up a bit and experiment with colour. The back does grow quicker than the rest and above the ears which makes it look worse. I'm better with hair though. Would never want to go back there :( Julia X",

It was hard but I also felt overwhelmed to be celebrating Christmas. I didn't think I would get the opportunity again. For your family, you are still you, with or without hair and they are wanting you to know, nothing has changed. With you however, everything has changed.  I'm now 13 months post chemo and my avatar pic is me this Christmas.  Growing your hair back is a journey in itself. Waiting to see what colour and texture it is. I've gone from very long straight to very very curly. But it's still changing every month and it's good to have a different style every month until I am back with hair I feel happy with again.  Don't try to remember who you were. Find the new you. With no will in the world will you be the old you but you never know you could like the new you much more than the old. It does take time though.  Julia X ",

I had it and it worked very well.  Before I had a WLE I was geared up for a mx as I had triple neg lobular cancer. My surgeon due to my age and body frame said he would do a bilateral as body image was very important too me and he wanted to achieve good cosmetic results. However the chemo worked so well I didn't need the mx. Some surgeons have a negative view about removing a healthy breast but if you are clear that you want to have equal breasts and get a good cosmetic result due to your age I think you would be OK. It's worth discussing it soon. You need to talk about types of reconstruction and if you have immediate or delayed recon. Do ask to see photos of the surgeons previous work so you are clear about what the end results could look like.  All the best with the forthcoming weeks. Keep posting when you need help or support.  Julia X ",

They don't like seeing you go through this. It's a steep steep learning curve for all of you. I frequently wished I had no daughter and no partner as it would be easier for me to go through it alone. Then I quickly realised it was those people that dragged me through treatment. And quite often with a laugh and a joke. You don't have to 'cope'. For me I literally just existed through treatment , it was just about surviving. Now I'm through it I'm slowly emerging from that existence and starting to 'live' again. Cancer is Cancer. It can affect many many parts of the body. I use to say I had cancer. I didn't always use the specifics as in breast cancer. We are all proud people, I have lost so much of myself but I'm finding it again a year after diagnosis. you will feel so many crap and scary emotions whilst going through treatment but there is light. Mention to your BC team how you are feeling and you may get into a counselling service. Again something I was also adverse too until I got cancer. All the best x",

You will find most studies research is from the US.  Taxanes (third generation drugs) give benefits to certain types/stages  of BC. Natures review clinical oncology 2009 reviewed 21 trials affecting nearly 36000 women and compared those who took a taxane with those who didn't. The % increase in survival was noticeable.  As with the paracetomol, every drug comes with a patient info leaflet that has a list of possible and reliable side effects. they can't be facts because it's not a fact you will get all if any. Any chemo comes with a risk of death through sepsis. Epirubcin can effect the heart long term and radiotherapy can cause long term damage to heart and lungs for us lefties. Everything comes with a risk but that risk is deemed negligible in most cases against the risk of cancer killing you.  Docetaxol can cause peripheral neuropathy which can be long term but this is monitored And in severe cases the drug is stopped.  Julia X ",

This post is saying that it's not always the case and to show encouragement and support And to try an alleviate any stigma with Docetaxol.  Julia X ",

You are right though, any ads can be hidden.  I am not here to defend the fundraising team but do have an understanding of the necessity of fundraising. There are three times as many Macmillan volunteers than there are Macmillan staff which gives an indication of how important the unpaid work is compared to what macmillan can afford to fund.  Losing my hair was very traumatic for me but I'm 2 years on now and find I'm less sensitive now. whilst I agree it's not the best catchphrase I can see why folk would want to show a united front against cancer in shaving their hair to raise money to help people like us get the best possible treatment. Of course, losing your hair is the tip of the shite iceberg that is BC and I wouldn't expect everybody to 'get' what cancer feels like but I bet the people who shave their hair think they are helping and in a way showing empathy/compassion, showing they are trying to relate to what happens when cancer happens.  I personally would feel very awkward telling someone who has just shaved of their hair to raise money that I find it a very insensitive campaign because the thought was there.  Julia X ",

I could be reading it wrong but it's interesting, many thanks Lou x  Hi Loulou1007 My post to Jane was in response to her post about Anne's post. It gets confusing but makes sense if you read this thread in its entirety. I know sometimes reading isolated posts can be confusing. Anne had the oncotype DX test and this came back with a result that meant she had chemo. She said her tumour was 8mm I think. Jane came in after and said this was worrying her has her DX appeared to be similar but he oncologist didn't offer the oncotype DX test as it wasn't felt necessary. My comments were to try and alleviate Jane's concerns. Anne had a lower score of oestrogen and no doubt that the oncotype DX test takes this into consideration. Jane however, who wasn't offered oncotype as it was felt chemo wasn't necessary had a 8/8 score which is the best. Meaning that hormonal therapies will have the full % chance of working. The higher your ER score, the more your BC likes ER to grow so by suppressing this with hormonal therapies it works well. If you have a lower score such as 4/8 then hormonal therapies aren't so useful. Or if like me you have a score of 0/8 then hormonal therapies are no use at all. Your 8/8 score is the most optimum score so hormonal therapies are ideal. The question I think you are asking is why did you have chemo as well? Did you have the oncotype DX test that recommended chemo? Or was there another reason with your DX that meant chemo was recommended? Hope that helps Lou :) Love Julia x",

      "Content": "Hi Glasgow  Thank you for the information. There are many of us on here that are very familiar with the oncotype DX test and many that have had the test to help make informed decisions about chemo. In my opinion it is a very worthwhile test and takes the 'guess' work out of whether you should have chemo. My advice is that if you are offered the test then take it. If you have a low score - job done. This means you will not benefit from having chemo so there would be little point in having it. An intermediate score its probably the most confusing as the decision is left to you and being borderline is a tough one. A high score is job done too as you have chemo (it you consent). Chemo is not offered lightly nor where it clearly wont give any benefit. The main reason is that chemo can cause death in itself and you need to be fully aware of all risks against the benefits it will give you. The oncotype test wasn't for me as I was triple negative so chemo is standard treatment for this diagnosis. Trust the test. It has been developed for very good reasons. You don't want to be over treated at the expense of your long term health. All the best with your decision making. Love Julia x",

Anne's er score  was mid range which meant she might not get the full benefit of hormonal therapies Which is the reason chemo was recommended. The higher your score the more benefit you get from hormonal therapies i.e. They work better. Your ER score would have been out of 8. hormonal therapies with a high score would have been enough without chemo.

I've found them a great help.  The oncotype test blurb suggests it's for ER positive diagnosis so unless you are ER positive also I don't think it will be relevant for the Her2.  Oncotype is also for early bc, where no lymph nodes are involved so again I'm not sure if it would be useful on a secondary diagnosis.  Are you in contact with your oncologist? They will be able to suggest  other genome tests that may be good for you.  Love and best wishes julia x ",

Are there any positives you can draw on between now and Wednesday. Can you feel that the lump has got smaller? Did you not have a scan half way through chemo to see how it was working? There shouldn't be any major suprises next week if they have been keeping an eye on you. As for the tumour growing back inbetween chemo and surgery this is a common thought and common misconception. I worried and worried over this as I had to wait over 10 weeks before surgery. I was always reassured that the tumour would not grow back (i was fortunate in that my tumour had completely dissappeared after chemo) by consultants and I took a lot of convincing. In hindsight the 10 weeks I waited indeed made absolutely no difference. If there was any risk you would be in for surgery quick and if it was still growing whilst you were on chemo then it would have been noticed by now. I lost all nails too and as you say chemo is just one third of treatment. But it is one third that is now behind you and not infront of you. The things you say you need to do may have to be put on hold unless you can get them done for you in the meantime. I found that after surgery, the rest of treatment zoomed by and before I knew it I was back at work. I am now nealry 6 months back at work and thinking why did I wish time away! There is no easy way of getting through treatment. Its a means to an end. An end to cancer. All the best for next week. Please do try and make the most of the good time between chemo and surgery. Grab it while you can. x",

Then I had to have a word with myself and say that this was an American study (who I believe to be generally   A more obese/unhealthy nation) and it was talking about cancer in general not specifically BC. I was interested in the fact that they also mentioned exposure to 'radiation' was also a factor.  I don't think we need the extra baggage of wondering how we can finely time our lifestyles to prevent recurrence and take the blame for what's happened to us. ",

Is your consultant recommending chemo due to the family history? Have you had an oncotype dx test?  unless your diagnosis is the same as your relatives that haven't survived BC then please don't think your diagnosis will end the same way. There are differemt types of BC.  There is also a 100% 5 year survival rate with stage 1 BC.  Many don't have/need chemo but the decision not to take tamoxifen however is a big one as that really is your protective measure going forward. What was your oestrogen score out of 8?  Love Julia X ",

The positives are that you dont have to wait weeks for the scan. The scan (if you mean a bone scan)itself is ok compared to a CT/MRI. You get injected with a low level dose of radiation and then go back a couple of hours later for the scan which takes 20 mins and isnt uncomfortable at all. The sooner the results are in the better.

This site is great for advice and support.  I had chemo first (6 cycles) before a WLE (lumpectomy). The good thing about chemo before surgery is that you can get to see it working. I felt my tumour get smaller after the first session of chemo. You will be scanned half way through chemo to check on the chemo's progress. I had a great response to chemo. By the time surgery came I had no tumour left and no cancer cells were present in the tissue removed during the WLE. I also found that having chemo first makes the surgery and radiotherapy really do able in comparison.  Chemo is no walk in the park and how your body will react is unknown until you have that first session. I did have at least ten good days out of the three week cycle.  All the best xx",

As someone who has this I didn't want to have that make it worse. I don't take hormonal therapies however so I'm still pre menopause. It could be different for you on tamoxifen as your periods will stop? Theres the cap and condoms, neither of which are a turn On!!!

I'm wondering what you would have to go through before you thought it was justified to take time out? You aren't pathetic. Actually the complete opposite end of the scale. Your being braver than youve ever been. You know your capabilities. From the day I was diagnosed I never set a foot into the office until 11 months later. It was the best thing I did. I appreciate I was in a position to do this as I still got paid. For weeks two and three of chemo I worked from home. It was agreed through occupational health and I did 3/4 hours per day when I couLd. There was never any pressure.  Nobody will take better care of you than you will. Forget the rumblings at work, they are beyond your control but do be assured that you will have a post to go back to as you can't be discrimated against whilst on sick leave.  There will be no gold medals for slogging through only a detriment to your health.  Your hubby supports you too so it's good to go. julia x ",

For your oncologist 'to put the ball intto your court' they will need to provide evidence/statistics either way for you to make that decision. Have they mentioned the oncotype DX test? this is the maths test done to give you a score to see if you will benefit from chemo. Without them telling you what benefit chemo would be, you cant make a decision. As you are oestrogen and progesterone positive, tamoxifen or suchlike will be of benefit to you and you take this for a number of years so take this into consideration as this in itself reduces your recurrence chances. The clear margins is good as they are saying in the tissue they removed they took not only the tumour but healthy tissue so everything has come out. There is no residual cells which is a good thing. The affected nodes were removed, again leaving no residue. Has anyone mentioned if you had vascual invasion? This can affect if you go for chemo. On the basis that you had no residual cells and you get to take hormonal therapies, chemo may not be a benefit but as I said they need to prove that to you first. Julia  ",

Welcome.  I had the same surgery as you are going to have. to be honest I wasted a lot of money on bras that are now redundant. You will need at least one bra that is at least a size bigger around the chest because you don't want anything too tight. I stuck with my normal cupsize. Your dressings won't stay on that long but if you are having a drain that can stay in for upto a week. I went for a plain cotton m and s bra (they have a growing range of post surgery wear). I've heard asda do a very good bra too. Personally I think the key is too have one on preparation then see how well you heal and what your needs are as you are healing.  its great too read you are so active. I'm a huge advocate of keeping active. I was back exercising properly whilst I had RT which was 8 weeks after surgery.  I avoided high impact for a while though. High impact came around three months post surgery however I am in my early forties.  See how you feel after surgery. It is quite dRaining. For weeks you are very restricted to what you can do as you can't lift/drive/push/pull. Do take the advice you are given in that do your arm exercises as directed and don't get to physical too soon. All the best for surgery on 20th And I hope you find us helpful. Julia x ",

      "Content": "Hi Rach1969  Your GP can do a blood test to test FSH levels. But it will depend upon when you finished chemo. My periods returned 4 months post chemo. They like to give you up to 12 months to see if periods return. The FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) test will only indicate that you may be peri menopausal. You aren't classed as having gone through the menopause until 12 months of no periods. But I am guessing if you get put on hormonal therapies then its unlikely your periods will return. That's why a blood test is quite key. When you talk about HRT do you mean hormonal therapies? Oncologists are very reluctant to give HRT to anyone who has had BC. Hormonal therapies are Tamoxifen if you are pre menopause or aromatase drugs such as letrozole for post menopause. Sorry to read about the blood clot. Ouchy I remember the fragmin injections from being in hospital whilst going through chemo. They sting those buggers do. Take it easy. Love Julia x",

I had the fECT regime and although it was never ending going through it (Hospitalised twice) it did finish and 14 months on I have no lasting SE. Step away from Google. Google isn't your friend whilst going through treatment. The mmost serious risks from chemo will be the ones listed on the consent form you signed. (Neutropenic sepsis) Do see if you can have the White cell stimulator after every session. That will help. I was given 'udderly smooth' cream by my chemo nurse for my skin.  A cancer diagnosis is a real tester of a relationship. You and your husband vowed to be together in sickness and in health. If it were the other way round and you were temporarily looking after hubby I bet you would just get on and care for Him no questions asked. That's what your husband wants to do. Men like to fix things. You may find your feelings of guilt start to manifest themselves in other ways. As the annoying song goes...... Let it go. Focus on getting through chemo. Gran all the help and support you can get with  open arms because it will help you move on from this when the time comes.  Happy Easter weekend  Julia X ",

We have all been there and we initially thought we were dying. It's not the case. BC is the most treatable cancer. Not that I think that we are lucky but it could be different.  I was diagnosed 18 months ago. Treatment was hard, very hard and the emotional baggage of cancer is often underestimated. However treatment worked and I am in a very good place.  Take one day at a time. You will learn lots about BC whether you want to or not.  Grade 2 is better than grade 3. Oestrogen positive means you get to have 5/10 years of hormonal therapy to prevent recurrence so they are both positives.  Have you talked chemotherapy yet?  Telling your children can take some planning. My daughter was 9years when I was diagnosed but honest was my best policy.  Let your hubby take care of you and talk to those who will allow you to talk if you want to.  You will always have an ear on here.  Julia X ",

Grade 3 is fast growing and this is where the majority of us sit. There is a slight risk after surgery that the Grade is upgraded when tissue has been pathologically tested. Don't worry about the U5/M5 I think that describes the location within the breast. You have a tumor that's 15mm and a suspect area of 5mm. They will look at this during surgery. 15mm is small. Mine was 35mm on diagnosis and I didn't think that was that big. Invasive ductal is the most common type of BC compared to invasive lobular. It means its no longer in situ.... its broken out into ducts. That's when its called a carcinoma (cancer). Its a normal diagnosis. Being 8/8 is the BEST you could have hoped for as you will really gain much benefit from hormonal therapies. No lymph node involvement is the best you could hope for. The cancer hasn't moved from the breast (common with grade 1) If it turns out you are HER positive it means you will have to have chemo. However as you are suspected Grade 1 I would say you are HER2 negative. That's a good outcome. Your Breast care nurse will go through all this with you. Give her a ring it will rest your mind. From reading this diagnosis and as diagnosis's come its not a high risk breast cancer. However any cancer is cancer and having any cancer diagnosis tips your world upside down. Julia x",

Do these as directed as it's important that you work that arm so it mends ok and don't lift. Do follow advice even though it's tempting to do too much too soon.

Couple that with all the treatment you have had you werent going to walk away in one peice.  You seem certain that you are dying and that is why i would suggest seeking proper help. It's also taught me not too live in fear.  i had a phobia of death pre diagnosis so one of the many many things counselling helped with was that fear. I no longer have it.  Whilst you think you are dying you aren't living.  Please feel free to message me as I have been through counselling and cannot recommend it enough.  Julia ",

There are risks on diagnosis with lobular that it will be in more than one place but when it's confirmed where it is and treated the risk of recurrence is the same for ductal cancer.  You could use the NHS predict tool to find out your 5 and 10 year prognosis having had surgery, chemo and now on hormonal therapies. You need to know certain things about your cancer though like size etc.  The good news for you is that letrozole is keeping a recurrence at bay.  Julia X ",

So many of us put on a brave face and say yes we are fine when things are just not that. It's a load of guff because we don't want to bog folk down. You obviously aren't one of those people and that's a credit to you. But in the other hand you sound like your friends really do care how you are feeling.  your friends and family don't know what a secondary cancer diagnosis feels like. I don't know what it feels like and to be completely honest it is my biggest fear. You however know what it feels like and are in an ok place.  We all want and need to be treated differently when we have cancer. One size doesnt fit all. I need a bucket list and I was successfully treated!!! It's made me realise I am not immortal!  So no you are not wrong in how you feel. simply because there cannot be a right or wrong way of feeling. love Julia x",

Blood tests can be done to measure certain markers but that's not routinely done for BC in this country from what I gather. You may see your consultants regularly for the first 12 months post treatment who do Physical examinations.  You will have yearly mammograms from 12 months of surgery although some healthcare trusts work differently to this.  Ct scans along with bone scans etc are done if there are ongoing issues that need investigation after treatment has finished.  The best advice is should you have a new pain for more than a couple of weeks, get it checked out. I think as we know are bodies more than anyone else we are more than likely to pick up on something not right long before a consultant does. ",

      "Content": "Evening Jojo4  Ive gone through the genetic testing. I had a negative result and was triple negative. Dont worry too much about knowing exactly what relatives died of what and when. The first step in the process is to complete a questionnnaire of first line relatives who have died and what caused their death. It's all checked against databases. I was a bit shocked to learn my great aunt died of ovarian cancer whereby I had no idea It was that.  Its a very lengthy process but if you are seen soon there may be hope for your results to be back in time for surgery. The whole process for me took around 5 months. I had to wait 12 weeks for the results. I had had surgery before I got tested But it worked out all ok. You see a nurse and have a counselling session whereby both a negative and positive result are discussed. I gave permission for my blood to be kept and used for research purposes. It is a simple blood test.  A positive result will mean a bilateral MX is suggested and possibly removal of ovaries as you are pre menopausal?  Positive results aren't common but as already said TNBC is more likely to be connected to a brca gene fault but to be honest that's normally when you are diagnosed before 40years old. love Julia xx ",

Your consultants obviously know you are with the alternative methods and I guess you discuss with them what you take? I am also guessing you take quite a lot of supplements?

      "Content": "Hi hedgewitch  It takes courage to make any decision whether that conventional/non conventional or half way house. You talk as though you regret your decision to have chemotherapy and RT? Treatment for BC has changed a lot in recent years and continues to do so. One treatment plan does in no way fit all. Scientists have discovered so much and continue to do so that we aren't only having drugs used decades ago. We have hormonal therapies for ER+. We have Herceptin (biological therapy) for HER+ . Scientists are so close to preventative drugs for triple negative BC. We know about the BRCA gene mutation. Radiotherapy has become even more 'targeted' in the breast and risks of heart problems are now minimized. I don't think you can say that the field of BC research is stagnant by any means. Surgery doesn't always come first in treatment. More and more oncologists are using chemo neo adjuvantly. This is a great way of measuring performance and prognosis. I went for conventional because without chemo I most certainly would probably be on my way out now having had TNBC with node involvement.   Conventional treatments do carry risk but where risks are too great a consultant wont be offering it. The trick is to be at peace with whatever method you choose or not to choose. That's why the consultant gets you to sign disclaimers after all. Julia x",

      "Content": "Hello Craftyp  Welcome back. So glad you thought of us again to help. I was 41 on diagnosis and was triple negative so I didn't have hormone therapies however I've noted you didn't take tamoxifen for long. I assume you don't take any oestrogen suppressing drugs now? I had FECT too and after 5 months my periods returned. They came back for a couple of cycles normally then went into a weird sync, as you describe above. I was blood tested and it was confirmed I was peri menstrual. This can last years!!! Anyway, after a further couple of months they went back into being as regular as clockwork but a lot heavier. I think this is all part of the peri menopause. I actually celebrated my periods returning as its a good thing in terms of keeping bones and heart healthy. In your case though it means your oestrogen levels are still up which isn't ideal because you were ER positive, albeit weakly. You could go to your GP and ask if they can check the status of your hormones to see if you have entered the peri menopause stage. Either way I think its worth getting it checked with your GP as the advice with irregular bleeding is to get it checked. Your oncologist may be of help too if you are still in contact? I still see mine every 6 months - I am close to 2 years post diagnosis. All the best Julia",

TNBC likes to recurr just as much as her2 positive BC. My TNBC was grade 2. It's not always grade 3.  I sound very defensive but there are many tnbc ladies on here and whilst it likes to recurr more so in the first 3 years there are also many positives to TNBC.  Your comment that the majority of invasive breast cancer will kill you sooner or later is over generalising. Do the majority of us die from it? No we don't. Not by a long shot. The stats prove this.  Julia ",

From the sound of your posts I would say you have made up your mind and it would help if you had suppprt for this. In which case I would say go with your gut feeling.

However at the moment you don't know what your diagnosis is, your brain is telling you the worst outcome.  As Weeble says, take someone close to you with you to the appointment. There are a number of tests that are done starting with a physical examination, a mammogram then ultrasound guided biopsies if needed. Think about what you would like to ask the consultant if you get to the biopsies stage. I couldn't find the balls to ask anything but then I think I didn't want to know until It was official. I did wait two weeks for results but it sounds like you will get these straight away at the one stop clinic. That's a good thing.  My advice is to take painkillers before the appointment or have them in your bag. Take them if you get to the biopsie stage. You will need them.  Come back here when you have the results and let us help you. There are many many experiences on here.  All the best Jo.  Julia x",

My lung capacity was rubbish and my heart rate went through the roof very quickly when I exercised. With docetaxol I got anaemic so had blood transfusions. To be honest climbing the stairs without stopping was hard. i switched to using my bike on a turbo trainer indoors and walked a lot.

We have around 21 nodes in that area but they aren't all together they are in clusters. I had clearance , 11 removed only 1 of which was positive before chemo.  As your mum had only 2 nodes affected they removed the surrounding nodes around those two. To go on a remove more upstream would be excessive and more importantly increase the risk of lymphoedema which can be lifelong.  Think of the 5 removed around the two as the clear margin.  all the best to your mum.  Julia ",

There is no way of telling what side effects you will encounter until you have it. The best plan is to expect the worst.  I was very nauseous with FEC which use to come on around 3/4 hours after administration but it can happen more quickly.  From my experience of chemo I would not have managed a 3 hour journey at any stage in chemo. If you stay with a friend however you may find as I did that the first 3/5 days after FEC I was in bed. Would you be comfortable staying there feeling poorly? Maybe arrange that for the first cycle then see how you fare. Dont let my experience put you off as many don't get nauseous with FEC but it will affect you on some way.  All the best with it. ",

You are trying to kid your mind you dont miss something beacuse it might have killed you but actually this is part of you that has been removed without you wanting it. I found the hardest thing about 'moving on' ( I am 6 months post treatment now) is that sense of loss. I felt bereft. Bereft for my hair, my confidence, my pre cancer breast, my level of fitness and my body image. I kept beating myself up because alI kept thinking was that I should be more grateful I am now cancer free. But again our minds dont work like that. In the following weeks when the pain gets less and you heal your mind will become less hurtful too. You are still in early stages of recovery so dont be hard on yourself and its ok to miss your breast, no matter how much it was trying to hurt you. Take care Julia x",

Many ladies on here had tumours not picked up on mammograms or weren't palpable.  Right from diagnosis I was warned that the diagnosed size was likely to change on surgery. Even when it was suspected I had a complete response to chemo I was warned they could find tumour hiding when they opened me up. It felt like I was always prepared for the worse. Consultants never give definitives.  However big it was, it is now out of your body and no longer doing harm.  Ask your oncologist next week why it wasn't detected. Save the anger until then and think of positive things to allow you to enjoy the rest of the weekend.  Julia X ",

With the SNB they often remove the sentinel node anyway so it doesn't always mean even if you do have lymph involvement you need radiotherapy to the Axilla Area, they just remove affected nodes.  Lobular cancer often presents in that web way. I had lobular but was only one solitary tumour. they do MRI scan you though to make sure its not in the other breast too so rest assured youve had good surveillance.  I think you need to be asking your surgeon exactly what they do when the snb is done and if they remove the sentinel node/any other nodes and if there is involvememt would you have the Axilla covered by radiotherapy anyway? Recon will be affected by RT unless its delayed.  things will be one clearer when you meet your surgeon. I would advise staying away from Dr Google until then. Dr Google is no expert.  Julia X ",

Even if markers were present in your blood I don't think that would automatically mean resuming treatment because it doesn't automatically mean secondaries. That's why they rely on symptoms.  I had lobular BC also Triple neg and did have extensive scans before treatment commenced just make sure the treatment was only for primary BC. Having both lobular and being triple neg it was more tricky.  I think we really have to question what good a blood test or ongoing scans would do. The NHS can't Fund that level of tests. Hard for us for sure but as the other ladies have said, we have to start trusting our bodies and especially our immune systems. There are many things we can do too help ourselves too.   ",

If you look online at the cancer services for the choice of hospitals you have been given most of them are % rated. This may help you make a more informed decision. To be honest some consultants work across more than one hospital anyway. It also depends on what treatment you need. If you are having chemo then you will be going to hospital frequently, radiotherapy even more frequent so it makes sense to think about how far you will have to travel. I was fortunate in that my hospital (Torbay) was only 4 miles away. Love Julia xx",

      "Content": "Hi jenny1973  what was the reason you are needing a mX. Is it a large tumour being lobular or in multiple places ? It is possible to know you have lymph node involvememt from first diagnosis. Mine was seen in ultrasound and biopsy tested Right from the start  however I had chemo first. Where you have surgery first they like to wait until then to do the testing. They try to avoid axilla clearance now and the sentinel node biopsy is a good way of doing this. Full clearce adds a big risk of lymphoedema. You don't have to have immediate recon and regardless of whether you have lymph node involvement or not it can all be done at the same time.  Chemo doesn't affect implants but RT does and as Misty says you need to check whether you are needing RT after an implant unless you are having expanders fitted?  To be honest until you meet with the plastics team to see what they are recommending we may be jumping the gun someWhat. They will tell you what is realistic on your body and what can be offered.  Julia X ",

I too had a pathological complete response (I had TNBC) to neoadjuvant chemo, although my nutrition (which day to day is normally very good) went to the wall during chemo so it wasn't that. I had a WLE but then questioned why I needed RT after it was known I had had a PCR. Due to the TNBC diagnosis my oncologist would not recommend not having RT. He said they didn't know enough to be sure that by not having RT it wouldn't put me at anymore risk. You being HER2 + you may get the same response. As you say, you don't have to go with the advice of the oncologist but be prepared for them to say they recommend it. I didn't think twice about not having it because of the TN diagnosis.  All the best with the decision making x",

      "Content": "Hi Cycling girl  I had TNBC, invasive lobular grade 2 diagnosed at 41years. It does happen after 40 years but when diagnosed under 40 there is more risk at having the faulty BRCA genes. Being TN was the biggest shock for me to start with but I did lots of research and asked many questions from oncologist. The unfortunate thing is that there some very negative words used when describing TNbC and that in itself is shocking if you have it.  Ask to see the scores of the oestrogen progesterone and her2 tests. I had a 3 out of 8 score for progesterone but they still take that as negative. But I believe this can help. I have read that TNBC is attracting much research and there is  signs of movement on terms of finding a preventative drug. I pray this happens. It is not known what makes TNBC grow, that's the problem.  I pushed for the BRCA testing as my great aunt had ovarian cancer and her daughter breast. It's a long process and I'm awaiting results.  As you say TNBC responds well to chemo, I had neo adjuvant chemo. I had a 25mm tumour and one node effected and come surgery there were no cancer cells to be found. The risk of reoccurrence however is slightly higher within two years. However if after 5 years you have no reoccurrence then the reoccurrence rates after that time are far less than other BCs, if that makes sense. My oncologist described TNBC that responds well to chemo as being on a level playing field with BC that can be controlled by hormonal/biological therapies.  I have a daughter and panicked when I was tested until the genetic counsellor pointed out, testing is not permitted on under 18s. My daughter is 10. When she becomes an adult I can only hope there is so much more prevention/cure for TNBC. I have taken part in two studies and given permission for my tissue to be sampled. I did have RT after a WLE and if I were u I would question this again. As I had no cancer cells after chemo I questioned why I needed RT and my oncologist could not say it was safe not to have it as a preventative measure. With TNBC you need all the ammunition you can get I feel.  Julia x",

Please don't go into full panic mode with TNBC.  I see a consultant alternatively every three months (as you describe). I'm now into year two post diagnosis so this will change to six months soon. if you were to ask your oncologist, would your after care be any different if you had any other type of BC and the same treatment you would probably find it exactly the same. recurrence risk is higher for us within the first 5 years but get to that and your risk is way below ER+ BC. Recurrence of ER+ will continue post 10 years but it's not like that with TNBC. There are so many differt subtypes of TNBC that one size does not fit all and that's why we all respond so differently to neo adjuvant chemo. I like to view the positives of TNBC. Would I be wanting to take hormone therapies at 41 Years, no not really. I'm happy that if I can get through another three years my risk of recurrence is very low. Do speak to your Onco and let him give some confidence. Mine was terrific. Julia X ",

The consultant could've withheld the information from you until after Christmas but that's not Eithical either. This isn't the fault of your consultant so get angry at cancer and what it does to us moving forward.  I had a lump in my good breast that needed checking out I've also had a lymph node in my neck checked out all with a normal result.

It ended up being very little about the cancer but more about the way I was looking at my life because of the experience I had just had. My relationship, my job, my relationship with my family was all part of it and finding a counselor that I connected with meant I processed all the negative thoughts I had. You cant move on when you are carrying so much baggage. Off load. It sounds to me that your relationship with your husband isn't what it could be. Cancer aside, were you happy in your life before the diagnosis? You sound like you have very little self esteem. Why do you feel like your 'cocking up'. Have you considered that your husband may just not be sympathetic to where you are at and that is his issue not yours. For me cancer was life changing and it meant I looked at my life at the end of treatment and made a conscious decision that I was going to live how I wanted to live in order to keep happy and content. My relationship was the first to go. make a list of what you want to do and plan how you can achieve that. Be realistic about your goals and timeframes. Where do you want to start? Is getting a job your priority at this moment in time?  If you want to climb Kilimanjaro, make plans to do so. Take back some control. Cancer has controlled you for some time now, its time to get back on top. Love Julia x",

You have had all the scans you can have.  Your surgeon will have the results of the MRI before surgery today. Ask him about them to set your mind at rest before you go for surgery.  Treatment comes with set backs. I had a fair few. That's where the analogy of a roller coaster comes in. It's up and down.

Mine was very thick and it took weeks to fall out until it looked silly.  Take someone with you tomorrow. You will be given lots of information and they may also give you lots of drugs to combat side effects. It can be very confusing.  The blood test will be just to check you are in good health ready for your first chemo. It's standard procedure. You will have blood taken before every chemo session.  Take some pain killers before your picc line on Wednesday.  It's not painful just un comfy.  All the very best for Thursday. It's a worrying time because it's unknown. This time next week you will have an idea on what to expect from chemo.  Julia X ",

This is a crap time but it will help to look at the positives. The MX was going to happen whatever happened. Whatever nasty's were in your breast are now gone. I assume the other breast was healthy, which is good news. Try not to think of it as back to square one when the nasty's have been removed. You are still ahead of the game. The tissue removed will be sent to the pathologist where it will be tested for grade and receptor status. That will indicate what adjuvant treatment you will have and would have been done regardless of the MRI results you had yesterday. Everything is being done that can be done. When the shock of the MRI calms down you will start to feel better. Honestly. It takes time to get use to the news. Be mindful post surgery can make you feel down. This being the result of surgery and anesthetics. If you feel like this in a couple of days it will be the after effects of surgery. I hope you have a speedy recovery. Julia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Mazza2016  im sorry to read about your diagnosis but am glad you have found the Mac community. I'm hoping you find us a big help during a bad situation. Many many women on diagnosis automatically think to cure anxiety and recurrence a bilateral mx is the way to go. I was triple negative, lobular, 41 years old, lymph node involvement and grade 2 and convinced the bilateral MX was the only way to go. I had numerous appointments with my surgeon and was finally Convinced weeks later a WLE was the way forward. I'm so glad I went with that. I'm assuming a WLE has been suggested so far? being grade 1 and a small tumour  I think you will struggle getting a surgeon to say a single MX is the best way forward let alone a bilateral. Many surgeons won't remove a healthy breast.  My surgeon was very frank with me. He told me removing both my breasts and possibly being very unhappy about my appearance even with implants, it was no guarantee to 'solve' my anxiety. I had major anxiety being Triple negative. He also said having both breasts removed had no bearing on whether I would die of cancer nor would it stop a recurrence. It was harsh but I got what he was saying. He was saying it was over treating.  I had a very successful WLE but months of counselling after to help with the anxiety. To be honest many of us here have counselling regardless of what surgery we have as the fear is still real with a  MX.  You should be able to talk to your surgeon about what and why he is recommending. You should be able to see photos of MX's and reconstruction your surgeon has done so you can be fully informed.  it doesn't seem your BC team are trying hard enough to inform you about what and why. Has your surgeon agreed to the bilateral? That's the first hurdle. If he's in agreement then aslong as your signing the consent form you are good to go. My only advice is to take time to consider this carefully.  All the best  Julia X ",

The nodes that were affected have been removed. The Cancer has been taken out of you. That's the crucial thing here. I had 11 nodes removed even though only one had been affected.  Waiting for scan results is torture, I won't lie, but they need to be done even if it's just to confirm its only the BC you need chemo and Rt for. After my diagnosis I had a CT, MRI, and bone scan as I was triple neg and lobular. All this sent me into a right spin and I started to shut down. I quickly realised I couldn't focus on treatment if I was so negative. Scans do Give peace of mind . Not everyone does get scanned on diagnosis. Try not to worry about what you don't yet know. It's hard I know but you need to recover from surgery. There will be many blows along the way but there will be peaks too. This is all still very new to you.  Friends can become detached as they don't know how to be.  They will need time just like you.  It's a long journey but it will be done.

      "Content": "Hi Daisy  Firstly, sorry to hear about you mum. Your support will be meaning the world to her during this time.  I can tell you about my situation which is similar to your mums and you can compare to others. I've just finished 6 cycles of chemo. Chemo was my first treatment. I was scanned after chemo 2 and after chemo 6. Luckily the tumour has responded to chemo and done one! Phew.  I found that whilst having chemo you have lots of contact with your oncologist but I didn't meet with my breast consultant At all. I was lucky in that the consultant that did the ultrasound half way through chemo told me what she was seeing. That's obviously what your mum needs, information on the chemos progress as you go on.  now I've finished chemo I am now due back to see my breast consultant next week where we will talk sugery. At this stage they have indicated a lumpectomy.  i too had queries with with my lymph nodes. I asked my oncologist how do they know what lymph nodes have been effected by cancer cells if after chemo the cells are no longer there. He told me scar/tissue damage will indicate how many nodes were previously effected. As I am lead to believe, it's not until surgery that they will know about the damage to the lymph nodes and will take out what they need too.  Hone this helps and all the best julia x",

      "Content": "That is good news Pinksparkle. Not that I wish lymphoedema on anyone but its a better outcome than others. I was diagnosed with lymphoedema  5 months from surgery but didn't get antibiotics and cream. What I would say is that when you go back in two weeks ask that you are referred to a specialist clinic. Lymphoedema needs help in reducing the swelling and getting the lymph fluid draining away from the breast again. Lymphatic drainage massage is one good way and I found the thing that worked the best for me was kinesio taping. The cream may help the itchiness and soreness but ultimately may do nothing to reduce swelling. The feelings you are having concerning mistrusting the consultant are all normal and part of 'moving on'. Once you start trusting your body again you won't take every pain and symptom as a sign of a recurrence. It takes time but it will happen. I had 5 months of counseling to get me into a good headspace but it was worth it. I also found in hindsight worrying is exhausting so its so good not to be in that zone. It will get better. Trust me.

You and I both know that is  not how BC is diagnosed. As you have a tendency towards anxiety try and avoid situations that make it worse.... Googling is one. Hide the computer Along with the eggs in the garden.  My mantra after I had my initial biopsy was that I wouldn't allow myself to worry unNecessarily. It was almost a defence mechanism. If I didn't think it, it wasn't going to happen. If after 5th you are told it's nothing sinister you will look back and think why did you get yourself into such a stew. You have been through enough already.  However, I say all this and know it's easier said than done.  I still get an itchy boob 14 months after surgery. If I scratch it for long periods I make it red and sore. My skin is very sensitive now especially after RT. It's probably just protesting about being itched. Are you using any different skin products?  You know your anxiety triggers better than any. For the time being stay away from the research.  sending hugs to you.  Julia X ",

Scientists are still working on why it reappears in some cases and some not. It can never be guaranteed despite surgery that a cell hasn't sneaked off and lies dormant for it then to start overcoming your body again. Because of the area you are finding cells present it is likely its from the original diagnosis. What the scans will confirm is that it hasn't reached other parts of your body. Then you can get the best treatment plan set up and most suitable chemotherapy drug. I can understand your need to know what is what. When I was first diagnosed as I had a particular nasty type of BC and it was already in my lymph nodes I had three other full body scans. That was the hardest time and I dipped very low. However, you will find the strength to fight this again with your husband and family around you and us supporting virtually. Hugs back at you. Love Julia x",

As this is your first chemo session, its wise not to take chances.  Sepsis risk is between day 5 post chemo and 15 But again as this was your first session it was wise to keep an eye out on how your body was reacting.  You will probably feel rubbish for a 2/3 more days then start to pick up but remember that's when you are in the sepsis risk range so monitor temperature and act on anything above or below critical points.  next time round it will be less scary as you'll have an idea of what to expect. take it very very easy over the next few days. julia X ",

All the chemo therapies you are having do different things.  As JJ has said, if you are waiting for SE then see what FEC brings as that made me very sick however that may be a reason to avoid it!  You say your tumour has shrunk quite a bit. I had neo adjuvant chemo and had a pathological complete response by the end of 6 sessions (FEC t). Imagine what your response could be like after 3 FEC, you could have no tumour or any cancer cells left.  It's a conversation you need to have with your oncologist and a decision you can live with. ",

There are many reasons why it won't be cancer but your mind is drawing to one conclusion. Every day is precious, you'll appreciate that. I waited for many many test results to see if my BC was metastic before treatment began and my mantra was to not ruin days/weeks of worrying over something that Id made up in my head. until you know for sure you may find you've been stressing for no reason and that's days/weeks you don't get back.  We can't speculate about what is going on only a serious of tests will get to the bottom of this.

I think Herceptin is mostly given after chemo and over a period of time as injections but it can also be given at the same time so do check.  I had a Picc line so dont know what it would have been like without it. For me it was well worth it. Bit uncomfortable going in but not painful. Takes around 24 hours to get use to it. Bear in mind it needs flushing and the dressing changed every week. Some chemo units say go in for that others can arrange home visits.  Be guided by your oncologist. My chemo unit didn't give me an option, it was picc or nothing.  Julia X ",

In hindsight I would have taken some pain releif such as paracetomol before having my PICC inserted. Its not painful as such just uncomfy. Do remember to breath deep breaths when its going in or you will end up light headed like me. When Im stressed I seem to hold my breath. Not condusive to pain control. The line takes a couple of days to get use to. The chemo nurse may suggest a warm compress should it get sore. Mine behaved lovely so didnt give any problems. I cut up old coloured/patterend tights and used then as covers. The MRI is more detailed so will hopefully confirm what is going on with your liver. I would imagine the results will need to be back before you start chemo but it may not happen like that. I was warned that CT scans can pick up areas on organs that could have been there for a long time it doesnt mean that they are cancer. If the suspicious areas are found to be secondary breast cancer (cells which have originated in the breast but have moved to the liver and started forming) it is as you have been told, incurable. That means that they cant remove it completely but they can stop and slow the growth of the cancer using specific types of drugs and chemotherapy. It will depend upon what receptor status your breast cancer has been defined as. (Oestrogen, progesterone, HER2). There is a secondary breast cancer forum which I know has active ladies on. I hope the MRI happens soon and its just the primary breast cancer that needs dealing with. All the very best.  ",

I guess the path lab have taken longer than expected or is the delay with your MDT? It might help you to find out where the delay is.I had clear margins so I didn't have further surgery but I am sure the extra 7 days of waiting for results won't have any detrimental affect. I know you are eager to get on with things but the majority of operations achieve clear margins so the reality is that your plan wont change. Its just playing on your anxiety. As soon as you get the results, the length of time you have waited disappears from your mind completely and you move into the next treatment. All the best for the 18th. Julia x",

I entered a RT trial.  As a younger women diagnosed well before screening age I wonder if things will ever change regarding earlier screening. I doubt it as they will argue our breasts are harder to screen and we are in the minority age bracket for getting BC. We know however the younger you get it the more advanced it is on diagnosis.   The NHS in my opinion dropped a massive clanger last year when they sent out footnotes with mammogram appointments saying there was a risk that early detection could lead to over treatment. Big big mistake. I know lots of ladies that I've had to beg to go to to that screening as they considered the over treatment risk to much.  FB is a good way to get your message across but then you would have to look at your security settings to be able to reach as many folk as you can. A blog on this community is another idea Or just blog in general. I follow Kris Hallenga who founded Coppafeel after she was diagnosed at 23years with metastic BC. She is now 30 years old. I watched her documentary years ago before I was diagnosed and was drawn to her. She won a woman of the year award. julia X  ",

(More precise than mammo) The problem being it's difficult to be 100% accurate Even on scans.  It is weird that your oncologist moved you off of EC after only one dose. Was he going by how he thought the tumour felt with examination? They normally only make decisions like that after scans to back up what they might/might not be feeling.  Just because it feels big to you doesn't mean it has got bigger. To be honest chemo affected both my breasts and all my body so nothing felt normal to me. Some days it felt small, others big and it was very sore. Touching it regularly also doesn't help. Come the end of chemo however I had no cancer left. Chemo had done its job to the max.  Go with what the scanographer is telling you. She's the one reading the screen.  Speak to the oncologist and say what you have been told after the scan And ask why you weren't given the opportunity to carry on with EC.  julia X ",

I've wasted so much time worrying and hated that time. We know worry can't change what's coming our way. with a previous cancer diagnosus however we will also live on a knives edge.  You could ask the scanographers explicit questions like do they think it looks like a cancer DX but if you are like me I was to scared. Again I wanted to wait until the results were given formally. You could speak to your BC unit and get the results of the ultrasound before waiting for the CT scan.

      "Content": "Hi Janey Welcome to the site and congratulations for getting through chemo without us :) That's a major positive in itself. We have all been there. Its like our minds develop a persona of their own. Its like the devil sitting on our shoulders bellowing in our ears that we are going to be one of the unlucky ones and we cant reason with that devil. We always default to the worst case scenario. Our minds run away with us. The trick is reining it back in again and that takes time and a lot of practice. Think of a balance of scales. In one hand list all the positives : Chemo will have done its job, surgery will remove all of what is left, you are having reconstruction so will have a breast shape, you get to take hormonal therapies to help prevent recurrence?? and you haven't been told its incurable (a major positive). The opposite side of the scale is your mums diagnosis but is there any connection between your mums cancer and yours? You have to always find more positives than negatives and at this stage you can do that. I only stopped fretting a good six months after treatment ended which would have been 18 months post diagnosis. BUT it does fade with time. Your life is on hold at the moment but the good news is that a new life happens and as you get stuck into that new life the old life does become a thing of the past. You may feel after all your treatment has ended you need help 'moving on' and that support is out there if you ask your BC unit. Mindfulness is a great place to be in and I highly recommend it. Stress and worry wont help you in staying fit and healthy so you may need to learn new techniques. This is such a common issue - you aren't alone in your thinking. Julia x",

I learnt the hard way tthrough chemo.......... I stopped drinking enough fluid and ended up in hospital. My advice (and that given by the chemo ward) drink fluid in whatever form (obviously not alcohol for at least 3 days post chemo lol) There are many benefits to consuming green tea. Obviously if you havent been used to it then it would be hard to 'aquire' the taste now especially as your taste buds will be all over the place. I would give it a try however.  I found sucking on ice lollies helped but aim for at LEAST 2 litres of liquid per day. ",

They are slightly uncomfortable going in (take pain relief before it happens) and then you will have an x-ray to make sure its on the correct place. You also need to consider that it needs a weekly clean/flush. You may get the choice of a home visit or visiting the chemo unit weekly. I choose the chemo unit which in hindsight was good as it meant on the 5 day after every chemo session I was forced to get out and about, for which I also felt better for after. The risks if you don't have a PICC are that the chemo damages/destroys your veins which is very painful and very problematic for future sessions and time consuming. Some ladies are allergic to the dressings they use and some have had infections in their lines but on the whole I think there are mainly positives to getting a line. All the best. Julia x",

I'm not sure what 'marking 2' means ( I think its to do with tumor markers)  but 90% of cells with ER indicates it likes ER very much and again the PR score is high. This is good indicating that hormonal therapies will be very good for you. I expect the predict tool will support that statement. Sounds like it does if you are up in the 90's without chemo.

Before you do broach the subject with your friend ( who actually sounds a very decent friend) ask why she told this guy. It may have been the guy asked outright what surgery/treatment you had. She probably felt obliged to say. No one would have known he would express such an opinion on it all however after being told the facts! If he had kept quiet no doubt you'd be none the wiser. Your friend is giving you a heads up with this guys opinion so you aren't caught in the headlights should he mention it face to face.  im the only woman in my office and the guys  knew I had breast surgery. Like most guys they were/are curious to know if I still have my own boobs. It's a man thing! when they have asked I've been candid in my reply And it's left at that.  For me, it's  something that happened. I'm not uncomfortable talking about it and I'm still happy with my body.   We are all different though. Your friend will no doubt feel mortified if you get heavy with her for telling the guy. im sure she didn't feel the information was confidential and I'm sure she never meant to cause you hurt.

You are right, and its good you have realized  that this is more tricky than you first realized. It doesn't help when celebs document how easy surgery for BC is etc because you get the impression it can be done without any fall out. Your BC sounds very early stage which is a very big positive but its still cancer and as already said so well, the psychological affects of a diagnosis can be far reaching long after the conventional treatment stops. Don't write the holiday off yet as you have every chance of being well recovered from the WLE then.  You haven't said if you need radio therapy though? that will need to be considered if you do.

Everything about your diagnosis suggests early stage so I wouldn't expect it to go from that to grade 3 or stage 2. The tumour size suggests it hasn't reached anywhere near the lymph nOdes. However I do remember how anxious I was until I hasten to add I was told it was still grade 2 stage 2 and nothing had changed. My tumour was actually smaller than first predicted.  Go onto Pinterest on your phone and have a browse. Theses always something interesting to look at and it keeps you distracted.

My oncologist is my hero and one of very few that makes sense. Sounds like you need much more evidence about why you are needing chemo. The oncotype DX test would be great here. As others have said you dont want belt and braces - chemo is too harsh for that. You only need to take it if there is a clear cut benefit. I cant believe they said to you because you are young you can withstand more treatment. What rubbish. Probably one of the worse things I have heard!  You should be offered chemo purely if there is a benefit that it will prevent reoccurence or secondary.

As Della has said, shuting the family out may end up biting you on the bottom. I like you, did that initially but then quickly found without them I could not have survived.

Close family may be struggling to cope with what is going on and dont want to show their fear for fear of making you feel worse. To hear you talk about the SE of chemo can be shocking especially if they have no expereince of chemotherapy. Lets face it the biggest risk of chemo is sepsis and I signed to say that I knew it was a risk that could kill me. Your family may also feel by allowing you to go into the doom and gloom of chemo that they are accepting of it and actually they may not wnat to accept that there is a risk. They will also be worried and dare I say it even feel sorry for you having to lose hair etc. You do need one or two people whether its family or a friend who you can turn to and who will allow you to say and do whatever helps you get through treatment. Not everybody needs to know everything. Only my partner and a close friend really knew what was what, warts and all! My Mum didnt see me at all through chemo through her choice. I would never hold this against her as my dad had just died and she just couldnt cope with any more. Nearly all of us on here have shared your worry over hair. It was the first hing I thought of when I was told I had BC. Shit what about my hair. I am 11 months post chemo and Ive coped. We all cope. The only guarrenteed way not too lose hair is by not having chemo and that's not an option for all of us. Please remember hair loss is temporary. Ok, it may take years to grow back if you have hair as long as mine was but I only wore wigs for 5 months. My short hair is so worth me being successfully treated for BC. I have a good prognosis and thats what matters. All the best with chemo - join the Chemo club to talk with other ladies going through it. Julia x",

It was around 2 weeks after I was diagnosed.  I managed to get hold of a super book from one of the breast cancer charities with super heroes in it (I'll let u know more later as I will dig it out and tell you more) . It was the only book I thought age appropriate. The others I thought were cringeworthy.  My daughty Daisy knew I had had something done to my boob (the biopsie) as I was in bed with the pain after it so I followed it on from there. I explained the biopsie was to test a lump I had found. I told her it was BC and I needed to have chemo which would make me look different and make be poorly. I also explained about surgery. She then had the book to read through in her Own time. She asked lots of questions which I always answered. She initially worried she would get BC too.  I never said to her that cancer was life threatening which in hindsight I could have done. A few weeks into treatment Daisy came home from school saying a friend had told her you die from cancer which upset her so I had a conversation with her about how well mums treatment had gone etc and I would recover.  I did tell the school I had BC and Daisy received a lot of emotional support  through thrive.  Daisy never ceased to amaze me at how well she coped. She inspired me. Kids are very in the moment so whatever you tell them one day they will have moved on by the next.  Julia   ",

      "Content": "Hello Purplejan  I was all for a bilateral MX but was persuaded kicking and screaming a wle was enough. I had ILC but dont give it a second thought as my main concern was being triple negative. As Carolyn says, you need to find a surgeon that will remove it first. Being a grade 2 with no node involvememt and low oncotype score doesnt put you at high risk of recurrence. Recurrence in the breast isnt the biggest problem for us its metastic breast cancer. My surgeon was very blunt with me and said removing your breasts would not mean i didnt die from bc. From then i decided to keep my breasts and deal with recurrence in the breast but to do my upmost to stear clear of secondarys. Your family have a point. Major surgery for how much benefit? I thought removing my breasts would stop my anxiety. Now i know it wouldnt have. Fear of recurrence is a seperate issue to whether you have or don't have your own breasts. An issue that should be dealt with via psychological help not a surgeons knife. As i understood with ILC the risk is at first diagnosis when you are more than likely to see it in both breasts at the same time. ILc's prognosis is actually slighlty better than Idc and is inown to be the 'lazier' of the two. Yes detection is harder but you will have robust aftercare. My ilc did present as a lump. Its not always a hardening only.  Im nearly two years post surgery and very happy i still have my own breasts. The best i can hope for is for this to remain the case. Do have a word with your surgeon as he will be the voice to listen to also. Love Julia x",

You would definitely have hoped this was all behind you now chemo has finished.  I haven't any experience of tamoxifen but I hadn't realised or know if it does cause neutrophenic sepsis. Thats implying it is affecting your white cell count. Have you looked on the patient info leaflet to see if it's a documented side effect? Your oncologist will ultimately advise you. Did the hospital give any indication why your white cell count could be low or did the blood tests reveal and type of infection? I'm guessing you have been taking tamoxifen awhile so it's not a reaction to it. Worth seeing your oncologist I would say. Julia xx",

I had oedema in my affected breast and the only thing that worked for me was the kinesio taping. I actually preferred the tape to compression bras which made me feel so bloody frumpy. I saw results after 6 weeks but after 3 months I stopped using it as the oedema went. That was two years ago and I\u2019ve not had it come back. If you learn how the tape goes on yourself you can change it with help every three days or so. Give your skin a breather in between as you can develop a rash from the tape. Rock tape worked best for me. Cheaper tapes aggregated me. You can get some funky patterned tapes or nude so the choice is yours I can\u2019t recommend the tape enough . Good luck with it Love Julia",

I was adamant I wanted a MX and my sugeon said I didnt need it. I fought against his advice for two months before finally opting for a WLE. If I had been told after surgery that clear margins weren't achieved I would have definitely said the next op would have been a MX. Its a tough decision but with TN and the results you have had after the lumpectomy it may be pointing that way to you. I had CT/Bone scan and MRI before chemo - they told me it was normal with TN and invasive lobular. Its a blow to be told now you will  head into chemo. Its tough but the support on here is great. You will find strength and courage you never knew you were capable of. All the best  and hope the chest infection clears soon x",

      "Content": "Hi Puzzle  I was diagnosed with lymphoedema in the breast 6 months after surgery. Surgeons normally like to give it at least 6 months post surgery to see if it is something you need to go to an odema clinic for. I was referred to a clinic locally and to be honest they were a waste of time. I was told to wear a compression bra (which I wear daily for running anyway) and they gave me a bit of bobbly material to wear inside my bra which did nothing but irritate me. In the end I found a lady who does kinesio taping and I had this done. Within 3 months the odema had gone.  I massage my breast with moisturiser (ok I know this sounds kinky!!) every night and you massage away from the Axilla site, so towards the good side.  Your lymphatic system takes time to learn to function without those nodes that have been removed. Don't give up hope as it's still very very early days for you.  To be honest I was glad it wasn't my arm as with breast odema you can hide but I'm so pleased mine was treated successfully.  Breast odema is becoming more common due to the different techniques used in surgery.  All the best with it. Julia xx  PS Compression sleeves for the arm aren't recommended 'just in case'. Just because you have odema In the breast doesn't mean you will get it on the arm.",

      "Content": "Hi Annie H  At the moment the only test that's available to check if you have a gene mutation which is proven to cause BC is the BRCA 1 and 2 mutation test.  I would suspect because you have all been older than 40 years old on diagnosis Your consultants haven't thought it worth following up.  Have a look at the OPERA tool on the Macmillan site. It's off line at the moment but should be back. You can also view information at  https://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG164 If when you input all the details you have explained above into the tool and it suggests you are tested, take this to your consultant whilst you are being treated. They can then take it forward. i have to say though it's normally for those diagnosed around or under 40 years of age.  I had the test and was negative but the letter I got said my BC still could be hereditary it's just that scientists haven't worked out what other genes apart from BRCA is responsible. I was however 41 on diagnosis. The younger the diagnosis, the more it indicates a gene fault.  it would be easiest if you or your sister take this forward rather than it coming from your children/nieces.  All the best for your radiotherapy. I'm sure you and your sister have helped each other through this rubbish time no end. Julia X ",

A friend of mine who had leukaemia took alot of his chemo orally and this was at home.  Some chemo drugs will lend themselves to self administration no doubt... abit like us self administering the GCSF drugs. Those that come with risks of anaphylactic shock or heart problems i would imagine aren't the ones for self administration. Our experience of chemo is unique to BC and there are many other regimes.  I personally have/would have no problem with self administration as the gscf at home was very convenient. Each injection alone cost over £300 so I understand why the NHS won't want to incur on costs ontop of that making me come in again just for something that I could do at home.  I fear for the NHS. I think it's an amazing thing about the uk but quite obviously it cannot go on functioning at breaking point. What would happen if we didn't have an NHS.  I read somewhere the average cost of cancer treatment per patient is £30,000. Mind boogling love Julia xx ",

      "Content": "Hi silvercloud  It does seem that the complete results of the patholgy tests are needed first before you decide. If you are her 2 positive then you know chemo is the way forward. If your not her2 + then could you not ask that you get the Oncotype dx test? That will give you less of a human opinion and is based on your tumour. However due to the mix you had going on in there I won't say chemo was unusual.  Its not a good idea going into chemo putting that pressure on your hair to stay put because your daughter won't be able to cope. You need to be reassuring her and talking to her. My daughter wouldn't allow me to take her anywhere when my hair first fell out as it was a big thing for her And she was so embassies. She was 9 years old. However in time when she got use to it and her friends and the school were so very supportive towards her she was very accepting. It was her who encouraged me to be brave and ditch the wig and she was the one who said when I showed my 'crew cut' to the world. It was great. The cold cap is no guarantee you will keep your hair.  its worth asking if chemo (if that's the route you go) can start after your hols.  Apart from that, the oncologist will tell you what drugs he wants you to have and how often. It's Normally 6 sessions in total every three weeks. Ask how it will affect your fertility if you are considering more children.  Chemo is the most scary of treatments but it's very doable. I got through it 17 months ago and I am fit and well. This site is full of people that got through chemo. It really is a means to an end of cancer but you need to be convinced that you do need it. Good luck with the appointment. julia X ",

I've known for 20 years I have familial hypercholesterolaemia. At the time of diagnosis (my 20s) I was considered too young for statins. Since then I've managed to lower it slightly but after treatment for BC it was raised again and my GP suggested it time to start statins. I was 41 and hated the idea initially but thinking about it I realised a lower cholesterol meant less risk of stroke and heart disease etc. I did insist on a 10mg dose though which is the lowest dose.  I've never been over weight, eat healthily, am a runner and have a BMI of 21 yet always had a high cholesterol which wasn't through anything I had done. I think we tend to associate cholesterol with bad lifestyle choices but it's not always like that.  The statins don't give me any side effects and your liver function is monitored on them.  Julia X ",

That's definitely not in keeping with the supportive nature of why we are here. To be honest I use to get very hot under the collar about people describing triple negative BC as highly aggressive because when you have TNBC you think you have no hope. ive learnt however It's not the case. Statistics can be used either way. We never know which category we sit in until 5 and 10 years time. i don't have a 90% prognosis of surviving 5 years but I don't like to think I'll be in the 15% that doesn't make 5 years in my category of diagnosis.   Your oncologist can give you a statistic based upon your specific BC without having chemo or he might have already done that? As Carolyn says, it doesn't mean you will be in the 10%. Even having had all treatment methods you can you will never be 100% protected and our 'predict' scores can give an indication of how likely we will survive.  Have you been able to consider hormonal therapies? I know in previous posts this has been uncertain. love  Julia X ",

What would be the alternative? You could be waiting another few weeks and in the meantime you have to cope with that mental anxiety making you suffer. Maybe the other women he is seeing too are in similar situations, you just don't know. There are times to be selfish. Look after you. The end of treatment is a very emotive time. For me it was when I developed a mental illness. Protect yourself and I guess your consultant may never know that the cancelled appointment upset you. It might also help to think that the cancelled appointment has nothing to do with you - someone somewhere has over booked. Why should yours be the one that drops off the table. In time when you go for longer periods imbetween seeing your surgeon you will find it does get easier so any future rearrangements wont affect you so badly. All the best for Thursday. Julia x",

The added emotional turmoil of  postponing the start is catching up with you, along with antibiotics you have been taking. Weekends always seem worse for periods of Worry. i don't think anyone of us here didn't go into chemo without fear and sadness. So it's not just you. As you are her2+ you need to think of chemo as a necessity. It's a very small bite size chunk out of what will be a long life. It will be worth it.  Tomorrow is Monday, the start of new beginings. Grab it and do something memorable to set you in good stead for Tuesday.   Julia X ",

That's definitely not in keeping with the supportive nature of why we are here. To be honest I use to get very hot under the collar about people describing triple negative BC as highly aggressive because when you have TNBC you think you have no hope. ive learnt however It's not the case. Statistics can be used either way. We never know which category we sit in until 5 and 10 years time. i don't have a 90% prognosis of surviving 5 years but I don't like to think I'll be in the 15% that doesn't make 5 years in my category of diagnosis.   Your oncologist can give you a statistic based upon your specific BC without having chemo or he might have already done that? As Carolyn says, it doesn't mean you will be in the 10%. Even having had all treatment methods you can you will never be 100% protected and our 'predict' scores can give an indication of how likely we will survive.  Have you been able to consider hormonal therapies? I know in previous posts this has been uncertain. love  Julia X ",

It happens at night because you have no distractions and your mind wonders. I was very close to slipping into depression on diagnosis until I realised I could not function if that happened. Then treatment commenced and it was head down and get stuck in. At least when you start treatment you know all is being done to get rid of the cancer and it helps. When you aren't you feel it's taking over your body by the minute . It's not the case. i can say sleep will happen as time moves on. In the meantime I can recommend herbal remedies, sleeping in the day if you need to and keep as  distracted as you can. Go to bed when you are really ready to sleep. Read before you try and get off. To be honest my treatent started with chemo so I seemed to spend nearly all my time asleep whilst going through that I needed to.  Mindspace apps are good but it takes awhile to be able to be mindful. It helped me though. When are you commmencing treatment? if you have any more questions we can always help answer them. Julia X  ",

I had my line inserted two days before chemo started.  The marker insertion is quite minor and done under a local. I think these procedures done under hospital condition have little risk of infection. i can't remember seeing any major 'wound' after my clip was inserted.  As for eating before chemo (I think your mum will start with docetaxel you said?) I would suggest light meals, nothing too heavy and sweet. I started with FEC and made the big mistake of eating heavily beforehand then was as sick as a dog! Docetaxel didn't make me nauseous at all. too be honest it's a bit boring having doc as it takes an hour and I found it boring. They will monitor your mum very closely whilst she has her first session. Take in water and a healthy snack as she might feel peckish During treatment. Beware with doc as side effects can kick in late... 2 or 3 days after having it. Co codamol helped me. The foods to avoid whilst on chemo are similar to those to avoid during pregnancy. Don't stress over food too much, the most important thing is to drink drink drink.  I hope all goes well. I found my day care unit fantastic and so so caring. I actually miss them if that doesn't sound too weird! Xx",

My line was fitted around 3 days before I was due to start.  The pre chemo chat is all about what you expect from the chemo as in side effects. You get vouchers for a NHS wig. You get loads of gumpf on neutrophenic sepsis and what to do if you think you have it. They go through foods to avoid whilst on chemo similar to if you were pregnant. They take bloods. Your height and weight are taken if not already done as this will determine how much chemo they give you.  Alk the chemo appointments may be made for you in one go so you may have a say in what time of day you have it.  If you go with a picc line then you have to arrange weekly cleaning and flush appointments.  Be warned, you do get bombarded with info. My partner came with me as I knew I wouldn't take it all in.  If you want to know about the drugs you are having ask as each one will give different side effects eg the red colour one (I hated this colour and could never watch it going into my body) is the one that makes your hair fall out.  All the best with it. There will be other ladies going through it simultaneously so join the chemo chat thread. I'm almost a year post chemo now. It's becoming a distant memory even through at the time I thought it would never end.  Julia x",

I had an easier time for it.  The extra two weeks you will be waiting won't mean your cancer has grown back even though that's what your mind is telling you.  I know it's hard as I have been through the extra wait but it made no difference to the outcome only meant I was very well recovered moving on to the next treatment.  Julia X ",

Not what you want to hear I know but  not putting a time frame on it will help not being disappointed, I was back running 6 weeks post chemo but the fatigue took much longer. When I say fatigue, I didn't need to sleep in the day but was just shattered come the evening. When you say fatigued how do you mean? A common SE of docetaxol is anemia.

I drove after three weeks and kept going until it no longer felt strange.  Mention your feeling unwell to the chemo unit when you have your pre chemo chat. Bloods will be taken pre chemo and chemo is normally only delayed if your blood counts aren't in healthy ranges.  Watch out for any swelling or hotness/pinkness in the breast  in the meantime if you do drive.

As already said, the adverts have been around for a long time but you didn't have a connection to them previously, now you do. There are also lots of adverts about dementia, heart disease, diabetes but the sad thing is that we tend not to take notice because we don't think it will ever happen to us.  When your treatment has finished and all has gone well you will be able to look at these adverts again not with fear and panic but an understanding and a felling of proudness for what you have gone through. You might also feel grateful for the money that is raised to have found preventative drugs such as tamoxifen etc. that's how I found I coped with the media coverage.  At the end of the day and selfishly I cannot wait until breast cancer no longer kills people and the only way this will happen will be by raising enough money for this to happen. I was triple negative so a preventative drug is all I want.  One big learning curve from all of this is how people judge others and they think its the right to be able to do that. The comment about using social media is a horrible example. I agree so much with you Grogg.  I don't have a large group of friends on FB but I have chosen carefully. They are friends not just people I know. My BC was put on FB by my partner who gave updates and messages of encouragement and love. The support I received from friends was immeasurable.

I had it cut shoulder length just to soften the blow. I kept a lock of the hair weirdly enough!  I went wig shopping whilst I had hair so the assistants could get a feel for what would suit. I went to house of Fraser. I kept as near to my normal style at first then swapped to a red head near the end of chemo as I started to feel rebellious!  I held out for as long as I could whilst my hair fell out. It happened over weeks. In the end I went so thin ontop my partner politely said I should sort it out! That's when I started with the wig. I favoured scarves most of the time as they were more comfy.  FEC t is a common combo but not a given. It normally means 3 cycles of FEC (three different drugs) which made me feel like I had morning (all day) sickness but only for around 5 days after I had it. Then it's 3 cycles of a taxol. I had docetaxel and no nausea hurray. But it did affect my mouth and joints. You will learn so much as you go along.  Chemo for me was literally about surviving and getting to the end. Never had I wished time away before then. It will test everything you have but you will find it in you to get through, Without sounding too phylisophical. Xx",

(Your words ha ha) Generally women would change something about their boobs which helps when deciding on surgery but you are happy with what you have.  I can't remember but I think you are being Brca tested later on? If the consultants think it's highly likely that you have the Brca gene mutation then it really is worth having a bilateral mx now.  I was all set for a mx but ended with a WLE as I had a complete response to neoadjuvant chemo.  I am 20 years younger and the surgeon would only do a bilateral because he wanted and I wanted very much to have a matching pair. I wouldn't have coped with different shaped/sized breasts and didn't fancy any more than one lot of surgery.  My surgeon suggested implants due to my frame and bust size  (34d). like you though I knew I was not going to have a diep/tram etc.  If you need RT then that's not recommended after implants unless you have expanders. (Pumped up over time to achieve a good shape).  I have seen implants and in clothes the results are amazing.  the cleavage can be different. Even with push-up bras it's hard to create cleavage due to there being more of a gap between the breasts. However the shape is fab. They are also more noticeable when you lie down as they don't droop like natural breasts.  Your surgeon has seen your body, what does he suggest would look right on your frame? Be guided. As I say it's hard for you as you have breasts you love already.  By the way when i had to decide on the type of surgery it totally messed my head up especially as I'd had 4 months of chemo first.  It feels like a life and death decision at the time but in hindsight it wasn't.  Hope the decision gets easier for you.  Julia ",

The most important thing is you getting your head around this diagnosis and you may find that's by just you and a few close ones knowing or a wider circle.  With regard to your biopsy I would say the pain is normal. I was in agony after my biopsy and was so bruised. I also swelled quite a bit. Any invasive procedure is going to have side effects.  Hopefully by now it's easing for you.  i was on pain relief for some days after.  I went to Glastonbury festival a few weeks after my diagnosis. I wasn't me and very anxious and thoughtful but I wanted distractions. My friend found this hard as she wanted to party. The holiday maybe a good thing for you but explain to your friend that you may not be 'you'.  julia X ",

Although it seems your world and life has ended at the moment I can tell you that it hasn't by a long way. I too was 41 years old on diagnosis with a 9 year old and had the rarer triple negative type BC like her2+.  You know exactly what the plan is as you have listed it in point form. That's your adVantage. You are already taking control. Some time very soon your survival instinct will kick in. Trust me.  I had neoadjuvant chemo. I can tell you that her2+ tumours can respond very well to chemo, as early as after the first session. We have a fantastic monthly chemo chat thread where you can go into chemo at the same time as others and support each other. It's not pleasant nor is it pretty but it's a means to an end of cancer.  You will lots more questions so fire away when you need too. There's always a virtual ear on here for you.  BC is so very treatable with high success rates. Allow a year out of your life to do this very important job.  Call on your friends and family for support, don't be afraid of asking for help with the kids during this time. You could do with it.  Hugs  Julia ",

Mine did.  The grade of your BC will determine the aggresiveness, although I don't like that word. The grade means how different the cells are from normal cells. Grade 3 being the most different, grade 2 intermediate and grade 1 slow growing.  There is unfortunately lots more to learn.

Have you tried to make an appointment through oncology reception?  Im surprised you weren't given an option over chemo as I had to sign an agreement before I entered Into the treatment and part of this was discussing the reasons for having the chemo.  Try your GP for the lymphoedema as they can give antibiotics and make a referral to a lymphoedema clinic.

It's just been feeling a bit weird, sort of tight and tired, so I went to the lymphodema nurse and she did the measurements. Sure enough, my right arm is slightly bigger than my left - not a huge amount, but too much to be just normal variation due to my being right-handed. She told me to increase my lymphodema exercises to twice a day, and to add in activation of the lymph nodes in my groin, stroking from my armpit down towards the groin. She also ordered me a compression sleeve, but said I don't need to wear it all the time - just to put it on when I'm doing physical work like housework or gardening. So my question is, has anyone actually been able to improve their lymphodema and reduce the feeling of puffiness? I've been doing the exercises twice daily for about a fortnight now and I think I can see some improvement, but it might be just wishful thinking! i had lymphoedema in the breast but it didn't affect my arm. the only treatment that worked was kinesio taping. You can have this on your arm. It's becoming very common now but odema clinics are still slow to use the technique I suspect due to training.  I would recommend it, it solved my odema after around 4 months. love julia xx",

I felt a lump which was already big and it tuned out to be BC but that was 2.5 years ago and I'm now cancer free. Dont get hung up chastising yourself on not going to the GP sooner. You can't change the past. You can influence your future. its normal to get fast tracked to the BC unit when the GP feels a lump. My lump felt huge but in fact it was 25mm. That's not big in the grand scheme of things.  A diagnosis will take time. The core biopsy isn't pleasant and I would adivse taking pain relief Before you go. If you dont like needles look away. You will have a local  anasthetic so won't feel it at all and it's very quick. I waited a week for results, some are given the same day. The ultrasound will give a good picture of the lump and they will look at lymph nodes under the arm too. You might like to ask the scanographer what he/she is seeing. I couldn't as was was silent due to shock.  If it is BC then more scans may be needed such as bone and MRI. This is normal But means more waiting of test Results. Results are not given out on the telephone So don't let this worry you on the day of your Nans funeral. It's sad you are having this loss to deal with also. I found my lump 2 days after my dads funeral.  90% of people undergoing treatment for BC will end up successfully treated. That's a good percentage. Please keep that in mind. So The odds are heavily in your favour that you don't die from this. It won't feel like it though if you do get a diagnosis Because your mind plays cruel tricks on you. Take this one step at a time because it's very overwhelming. keep preoccupied with anything you can.  Was the GP concerned over the result blood test results? What action was taken? Keep posting and we will help you.  Sending love and best wishes and remember there is a chance this may not be cancer but a benign cyst. It happens in younger ladies. i was 41 years old on diagnosis.  Julia X ",

Our trust only does mammos every two years from then on although I disputed this and got it changed for me As I had TNBC. I wasn't prepared to be left for two years.  Do ask what follow up appointments you will get though. I'm still seen every three months and I'm 2.5 years away from diagnosis and tbh now I find it too much.  You also need to be told that you are a NED (no evidence of disease) so don't be afraid to ask otherwise you may find that the consultants won't say anything and that's not helpful.  On the basis your tumour was removed with clear margins and you had chemo and/or RT you are deemed as a NED.  This is an axious time though, learning to life with a risk and learning to live life again.  One thing I've learnt though.. if you don't ask you don't get so speak out and ask the questions.  Love julia x ",

Its not a bad thing but only if it hinders us making an informed decision. I had node clearance (11 nodes in total) two years ago. I have no mobility issues and not had lymphedema. I am 41 years and very physically active so to compare our circumstances isn't ideal. Clearance doesn't automatically mean ALL nodes are taken just those around any that are obviously affected. I only had one node affected and in hindsight am thinking why was it necessary to remove 11. I did have lymphoedema in the breast which was cured after 4 months. Its never come back. Be clear from your consultant what the best case scenario could be in terms of the amount of nodes they remove and the worse case. Would you consider alternatives to clearance now such as hormonal treatments? Do you now what score the ER+ is at this time around? Node clearance brings a risk of lymphedema but you need help from your consultaint to ascertain if the risk of the cancer being left in situ will cause a bigger risk than the  lymphedema risk. What grade of cancer do you have?  That will help make your decision. Love Julia x",

Would you have preferred the results before Christmas? I think that would equally have been hard.  You don't know what the results are and you can't let your mind diagnose yourself with breast cancer. To be honest most diagnosis are only given after a biopsy has been taken so your consultant may not even have conclusive results yet.  I waited two weeks for a breast cancer diagnosis. That was 18 months ago. I could tell you BC doesn't mean the end but that won't mean much to you at the moment. During the time I waited for results however I was adamant until I knew exactly what was what I wasn't going to waste time worrying and making myself ill. I've done enough worrying since diagnosis. It's hard but you need to put it to the back of your mind. I think you will have more tests before things are confirmed either way.  Happy Christmas. Julia ",

I'm assuming your oncologist is still thinking tax is the way forward and not to continue with EC?  Is there any medication you can take to counter balance the mental issues? Could you be admitted into hospital when you have tax so any issues can be dealt with quickly? Would having weekly doses of tax help instead of three larger doses? Are there no other taxanes you can have without steroids? I do know they play an awful big part in docetaxel. I was told if I didn't take steroids then I could not have docetaxel.  I can imagine you are fraught with decision making. Let's hope between your mental health worker and oncologist they can come up with a way forward.  All the very best.

      "Content": "Hi Jojo4  You may not be offered chemo first so we are discussing something that may not happen however if you are, I can give you my opinion. I am very biased as I had such a great result from having chemo first. I would recommend it.  Chemo for me obliterated all the cancer so that when surgery happened there was nothing left to remove apart from clear margins. The result was minimal tissue being removed and minimal scarring. Having neo adjuvant  chemo can be a double edged sword. On the plus side you will get to see the tumor getting smaller and smaller hopefully to the point where nothing is left. If you have a pathological complete response to chemo then your prognosis is very good. I cling to this nugget which controls my fear of recurrence. The downside is if the chemo doesn't have much affect on the tumor. You then need to switch drugs to try another or accept that no response to chemo has a poorer outlook. If you have surgery first to remove the cancer then have chemo after you have no way of telling what the chemo is doing for you. For some people, that doesn't sit well. They like to see results. We say this based upon you needing chemo and you might not need it. It wont be clear if you need chemo if you are ER +  as that's only normally known after surgery using the oncotype DX test.

I would say that there are other reasons for not offering a CT and they have used the 'radiation' one as you are less likely to challenge it. To be fair a mammogram also gives radiation but its a lower does than a CT scan. There are protocols which dictate what follow up scans we get. These only stretch to physical examinations and mammograms. Lets face it, given the chance we would all like to know the full picture in terms of what are bodies are looking like inside but the dear NHS wont and can't fund that.  A CT scan/bone scan/x-ray  would be offered if you had pain that was lasting and unexplained but they don't offer routine CT scans after BC. You could go back and really challenge the real reasons for not having the CT as the radiation one is lame but equally its hard to accept that due to cost we aren't worth more scans than the mammo. I am not sure if there is enough evidence to suggest that routine CT scans are of benefit? Julia",

But by then it was big enough to be seen.  If the consultant had ANY doubt he/she would have done a biopsy. This implies the consultant is in no doubt that taking into consideration your family history and your symptoms you don't have BC. You need a second opinion.  Whilst I was going through treatment I had a scare in the good boob. I have calcifications in both breasts and pre mensturally they become very lumpy. I had the lumps checked out with fine needle aspiration and they are benign. I have learnt what lumps are normal at what time in my menstrual cycle. Did calcifications get mentioned to you and do the lumps get prominent pre menstrually?  I hope, for your own sanity and safety you get a second opinion.  All the best  Julia ",

Each one has its own positives and negatives and you need to be positive about triple neg.  i had a lobular triple neg BC. A double whammy of cancer types in the minority! My TNBC was a grade 2. You mention TNBC is more aggressive, do you know if you are a grade 3? Any BC has the potential to invade the blood. Mine had and had affected one lymph node. Have you been told that TNBC respond better to chemo (especially a taxol) than hormonal types? I had chemo and had a complete pathological response. By the time I had surgery (I had neoadjuvant chemo) there were no Cancer cells left in the breast or in the lymph nodes. Chemo had got it all so I take comfort in the fact that hopefully the chemo destroyed any cells in my blood stream too or any elsewhere! Reoccurrence stats are slightly higher with TNBC in the first 2 years. But drop after 5 years to a better place than hormonal cancers where the risk of occurrence can remain for many years.  I didn't consider the cold cap as I took the opinion that I didn't want to try and stop the chemo from doing its job. I wanted it all around my body and didn't consider having no hair a reason to try a cold cap. I do appreciate that not all people want to lose their hair. The other good news is that mine started regrowing during DocetaXol.  A book that helped me was 'surviving  triple negative breast cancer' by Patricia prijatel.  You have been shocked today (i continue to get shocked when I learn something new!) but you will feel better as time goes on and you learn more. all the best  julia xx",

I remember signing the chemotherapy consent form and the oncologist had written under 'risks' that I could die if I could an infection during chemo. I didn't give it a second thought then but since I've known of people who have sadly died from infections during chemo it seems real.

I don't have the option of taking any preventative therapies now but I would take them should they be a benefit to me.  You need positive experiences of her2 ladies and George's Jackie is one so he will be a massive help to you.

      "Content": "Hello iwannaliveforever  I was sorry to read that the site makes you worry. That's never our intention, we always hope we have the opposite affect. Ive looked into this topic quite a lot. There is no hard evidence that parabens are a causal factor of BC but I don't blame you for looking at it. I too have made changes with hair skin and make up. its much easier nowadays to find paraben/sls/aluminium free products. some brands are: missy deodrant innecto hair products Waitrose do a fab \"pure\" range sanex for deodorant and shower gel say \"yes\" products from boots palmers body butters/cocoa butters You will find make up harder. Boots are rubbish for displaying their ingredients within their make up and are one of the worse offenders with nasties. Bourjois are good. Bare minerals are good. A large M and S has a very good range of more \" up market\" brands which are kinder to skin. if it's not got parabens in the list of ingredients then it's a start.   Parabens give a longer shelf life in a product so if it's got a long shelf life the reality is it's got nasties in it. Also anything that claims to last 24 hours or you need a blow torch to remove it means it's got nasties in it!    Go spoil yourself.... your worth it xx",

Even a lot of meds don't carry the warning to avoid alcohol. The key is moderation. I think we all get that though. Im also a big advocate of not  depriving yourself of those finer things that make you feel good.  Pre BC I did drink more than the suggested units per week but not now.I would never give up completely though. ",

Surgery will happen on a critical basis only until full service is resumed. A WLE wont be classed as critical. For one reason or another I waited over ten weeks for surgery. It made no difference to the positive outcome. I know you are ready and psyched up for this but we also have to be positive about our precious NHS staff fighting for something they feel very strongly for and actually I support, as I also work for an emergency service.

The cover was lovely embossed picture of a wizard and it inspired me. I wrote notes in it to my dad too as he died a month before I was diagnosed. Writing your feelings down is very cathartic just like being on here.  I still have the diary and I can't read it now as it's a chapter best left on the page. What I would say however is that you will be proud. Bearing in mind I'm now 2.5 years from diagnosis I am very proud of myself and think I was brave. At the time I didn't and I see lots of ladies on here who don't like the term brave but believe me, as time goes on you will congratulate yourself and give credit where it's due. You are doing great Maria. love julia x ",

You make an interesting point about in the future when you are having a bad day you can reflect. In my experience I no longer get bad days, not like the bad days I did get, stressing over work or my daughter not doing as I asked. Those things don't bother me any longer. Cancer will always be our comparison and that puts perspective on life in general.  i had 11 months away from work, 9 months of treatment and 4 months of counselling. It had to be done. I needed that time to feel 'right' again.  I had triple negative bc and know the next three years are key in terms of keeping cancer free. But I don't think about it much. It doesn't stop me living. I'm a big believer in positivity and at the moment I am cancer free and intend to stay that way. I look after myself and keep happy. It's better for me than living a life in fear. Saying that I had a lot of help to get my mind where it is now. Start the diary, I think it will help.  Love Julia x ",

We have all been touched with a disease that has the potential to kill. Today we are still alive and are either going through treatment or have successfully gone through it. I couldn't bear being treated with kid gloves but appreciate I'm nearly two years post diagnosis so my 'panic' really has worn off. However I am not complacent.  Cancer may in reality not be the thing that we should most fear. Someone close to some of us on this community who was a huge character got through a battle with cancer. He very sadly recently passed due to a heart attack.  As Carolyn says, you could deny yourself that wine or that bit of cheese to later die of say dementia. boy if that were me I'd be pretty pi&&ed at denying myself those treats in life If that happened.  We have been given the insight into being close to death which makes us (or should) appreciate how flippin good life is. I sit and watch those crossing the finish line at the LVM and listen to the stories on how they got there. (I've been in tears for most of it!) People with a history of cancer and other diseases and I feel totally inspired and proud. The only person stopping us from living is often ourselves.  Take comfort in the fact that you all matter to alot of people who are trying to say they couldn't live without you. Julia xx",

You are petrified (I know the feeling very well). Who doesn't get scared after a diagnosis? So please don't beat yourself up over being pathetic(not that I think you are ). We don't have to cope with these awful situations. Allow yourself to just 'be'.  I truly believe you cannot go through cancer without a mental wellbeing unbalance at some stage. Mine happened after treatment. When everyone said great your cured lets all move on. I would have done and did do anything to help my mental state get back on an even keel, whether that's medication or therapy. Sometimes things do change as treatment progresses but it is uncommon for diagnosis's to change. You brain has a good knack of telling you the worse. You need to tell it politely to shut up. Friday will be here in no time.  I was Grade 2 on diagnosis. Was convinced they must have got it wrong as I was TN. But it stayed at Grade 2. If your diagnosis has been written as ER+ then the score would suggest it wasn't weak enough to be classed as negative. Hugs Julia",

I hasten to add it doesn't take long for them too grow back but they look awful once fallen off And they are sore. Ouchy.  You can paint them a dark colour whilst going through docetaxel to prevent it. It didn't know this when I was going through it. In France I've read there are specific products you can use on the nails to prevent them lifting but it's not used in the uK.  I wish I could be more positive but it was quite a harrowing experience for me.  ask your oncologist what he suggests.

I have problems with names but found I remember things about my work Despite chemo and 11 months off.  Anxiety Could be a separate issue. When did you finish treatment? I suffered with anxiety (not depression) for around 3/4 months after treatment of which I needed counselling for to move on from it. You may find the anxiety is the primary condition and the memory loss is stemming from that. Our brains do funny things when out of balance. Explain all this to your GP and they can make a diagnosis. Medication can help anxiety but you can't beat counselling especially when trying to move on from a cancer diagnosis. Love  Julia X ",

That was me over a year ago. Now I know I am not dying.... not for a long time yet anyway! I have re-read your post a couple of times. Has cancer been confirmed via a biopise or is that the results you are getting on Thursday? The beginning is information and shock overload. You dont know what you need to know or where to begin. My tumour was 25mm (you will be given a rough size of the mass) and I was also told it would have been growing for sometime. It was only picked up because I felt it. There is no screening when you are 41 years old. Just because its been in there a while doesnt mean its bad news. You will get to know : the Grade of cancer. This tells you how fast its growing. You will also find out if it has receptors to eostrogen, progesterone and HER2. The results of these tests will dictate the specific treatment. You may also get to know if an uultrasound was done if it looks like there is lymph node involvement. Even with lymph node envolvement its not necessarily bad news either. I appreciate I am speaking a foreign language at the momemt as there are test results yet to come. Each result will bring more panic and fear but in time that will give way to getting onto treatment. You assume most people would be positive?........ I never felt postive until I saw chemo working 4 months into diagnosis and then it was haphazard. Explain your partners existing depression to the consultant. They should take that into consideration. My thoughts are with you for Thursday. Julia  ",

I too had neo adjuvant chemo and had a complete response to it. Even with grade 3 BC (I'm assuming it is grade 3 as the consultant said it was fast growing) treatment can be very successful.  The wait until Tuesday will be awful for you both. The scan itself isn't nice . I wish you all the best that it's only primary BC and treatment can begin. There is always hope x",

We don't know what will happen to us and we take risks. Whilst feeling like that we can't handle being faced with cancer on the telly. It feels like its all around. It isn't it just feels like it at the time. We can't escape it. Mainly because it's on our minds 24/7.  i was off work for 11 months but read emails. I work for quite a large organisation and we have regular emails informing us employees/ex employees have passed With funeral arrangements. We were receiving them weekly to the point that it was upsetting me whilst on treatment so much I wrote to HR and said could they stop it, I found it to morbid. I was told politely no. 2.5 years on those emails don't bother me Because I no longer feel volnurable. I also feel embarrassed now for asking for them to be stopped. My dads funeral was two days before I discovered my lump. I know where you are coming from with your dad. ❤️ Cancer is all around us. 1 in 3 people and 1 in 8 people will get BC. With such a wide effect, the soaps will use it as a storyline and when we see it we do question our mortality. One thing we can't do though is compare diagnosis. We are all different.  Losing hair Is a biggie. In fact it's huge. my confidence left when my hair did . however you need a little mantra..  .... hair loss is temporary not permanant. in 2 years time, trust me, it will be a distant memory, your hair will be long again and you won't feel as volnurable.

      "Content": "Hi heather  I can only speak from my experience of a WLE and Axilla clearance but I definitely still had pain two weeks after surgery. In fact I'm 7 months post surgery and still get discomfort. Maybe your expectations of how quickly you would recover are a little high. Your surgeon will take a look at you Tuesday and let you know how well you are healing. It can take up to 12 months for our bodies to settle after treatment.  It can be a vicious cycle in that you get frustrated about not being able to wash your hair etc and still feel pain which affects your emotional state and vice versa. Your hormones will be all over the place which doesn't help and having a general anasthetic will also affect your mood. You also have to deal with the changes that have taken place to your body.  It sounds as though your 'friend' is feeling that you haven't supported her enough over the years and now she's making it known. Why she should make it known now when you are feeling very vulnerable is more the question. These situations bring out the best and the worsT in folk. You have to be selfish and decide who you need around you to get you through this. This friend may not be someone you should keep close at the moment. I found my best friend was the worst friend to have during treatment. She couldn't deal with any of it so kept away. That's changed the way I feel about her. We never fell out but I don't give her my all like I did before BC.  Self preservation is what it is about for you at the moment until you feel stronger again.  All the best for Tuesday. Julia x",

Can your teeth not wait until you have had treatment for your BC. Surely this takes priority? I had neoadjuvantt chemo and am a big advocate of having chemo first for many reasons. It's not advisable to have such major dental treatment before chemo Or as you suggest you run the risk of delay and you need to start chemo soon if you go with that first. if you have the tumour removed first you will still be looking at chemo 6-8 weeks post surgery so you then have a window for dental work but bear in mind you will be recovering from surgery and you don't want dental work to delay the commencement of chemo. do the teeth need to come out now? was your dentist able to advise when you said you were about to start treatment for bc? love Julia x ",

We are all strong ladies pre cancer, i sometimes wonder if that's why we fall harder. Many of us come out the wringer the other end stronger than before. Chemo is scary, no doubt. I'm a big advocate of having chemo first. I had it first and had a complete response. I wasn't her+ though but one of our Champs Carolyn28 was. Chemo does have SE but not everyone gets them all. It really is a case of wait and see. i actually found the first session of chemo an anti climax as It was so uneventful yet had built up a horrific picture. Chemo units are so very good a putting you at ease. They look after you. Do you have a pic line in? We have a fantastic chemo club with some great information to help you plan.  https://community.macmillan.org.uk/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/38/t/120536 With regard to anti anxiety meds I'm sure there is someone suitable but all I would say is , you will be having no end of drugs soon so you may not feel like popping more pills.  Drink lots and lots of water before the session on Friday and over 2 litres for the preceding few days.  Youll get through. You won't feel like you will but before you know it it's halfway then done. think of it as an inconvenient phase to getting your life back. love Julia x ",

Originally the counselling was about my fear of dying due to the cancer but it quickly moved on to all sorts of day to day issues I have.

I can't see any info on your profile page and can't remember if you had lymph node involvement? The MRI was for a specific  area wasn't iT yesterday? To do with your lower back pain? They normally only concentrate on one area. A CT scan Is used for internal organs and bone scan for bone mets obviously so when they said your MRI scan was normal, it hasn't highlighted any area of concern In the area they looked at. I had an MRI but only to the breasts specifically because I had lobular BC. If you get ongoing issues that need checking out you will be referred for the most appropriate scan. The bigger question is, how long would a all clear scan appease your anxiety? A day, a week, a month? It could turn into a vicious cycle. Trusting your body and trusting yourself to notice any changes is key and hard to do but it will happen in time. Take yesterday's scan as positive as before you went in I expect there was an element of you thinking it would be the worse outcome. The scan has reassured you there's nothing to be concerned about?  Im about to spend the afternoon in the kitchen baking, Carrot and apple cake with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting nom nom.

Chemo is a minefield and really is very individual. BC that are triple negative will have to have chemo regardless as at present there are no targeted therapies for it. Her2 positive BC normally means that chemo is needed to accompany herceptin. Without knowing the exact diagnosis of other peoples BC then yoiu cant really compare what treatment you are having.

I had the opposite in that I literally had to force water down.  The head in the vice sounds very familiar! After day 3 post chemo you should find you pick up and start to feel brighter.

      "Content": "Hi Justmai  I'm sorry to read your sister is now having to deal with a secondary diagnosis. It's obviously a very rough time for you all. You are very right, none of us deserve cancer. i can't really comment on the prognosis of your sister. The information you have, is it first or second hand? The specialists may be offering words of encouragement  because they feel it can be treated again. If they thought it was untreatable that's the time to worry. We need encouragement when faced with news we don't want.  Breast cancer can reappear anywhere in the body after a primary tumour has been treated. It doesn't have to be back in the breast. Places it is sneaky in returning to are lungs, bones, head and liver. It's more than likely the affected Lymph node in her head/neck can be removed to stop cancer cells circulating around the body. I had 11 nodes removed from my Axilla as part of my original surgery. The nodes catch the cancer cells like sieves to stop them moving on.  As your sister has already had chemo they will be probably offering her a different drug than what she orinigally had. All drugs are different and she probably will keep well enough to work.... If she wished. A consultant rarely advises you can't work during chemo but it's left to the individual to see how they cope. Some folk aren't in a position to quit work Or it's important to them to continue as best they can.  the PET scan would have identified  any suspicious areas that's why the whole body gets scanned.  Telling a person to rest whilst going through cancer treatment can be counter productive to someone who is dealing with the diagnosis and doesn't want to rest and let it slow them down. It's all part of wanting to try and keep some sort of control on their lives and normality. Only your sister will know what her capabilities are during treatment. You can be there for support.  Although you need you sister, she also needs you at this time. be there to listen to her as its a very scary time. Offer help where you can and just let her know you are there for and love her. Ask her what you can do to help practically.  All the very best Julia X ",

When you are feeling physically unwell your mood lowers.  Use a warm salt solution and rinse your mouth regularly. Use a soft bristle brush as those gums will be very sore.  You aren't evil. Cancer isnt selective. Don't be blaming yourself. You will love and live life again. I wish I could show you in a crystal ball. I'm heading for two years post diagnosis and my life is the best it's ever been.  T makes you nails fall off. It's another side affect but normally happens after the last dose. It's very sore and unsightly. Keep them clean to avoid infections in he nail bed. Julia X ",

      "Content": "Hi Hawkster  its ok to feel sorry for yourself. Who hasn't felt sorry for themselves during this awful journey of ups downs, and treatment after treatment. When going through it it seems never ending.  You do need to be able to confide in someone to get this out. To tell them those real fears. You say you can't tell them how terrified you are? I had amazing support too but one special close friend who allowed me to say anything. I used that to full advantage. My BC unit had a specific surgery nurse who I met and she went through everything including many photos of surgery. I wasn't shocked just surprised at how good the results were.  I've met many people affected by cancer lately and they all say 'people say I look so well or I am so brave but inside I'm a wreck'. To most people that's how we would want to be portraied because we don't want to have a deep discussion with them about our inner feelings and thoughts. I take comments like these as compliments, like in the spirit they are given. However you will need at least one person who sees you 'and allows you to be 'warts and all'. I've had 3 months of counselling and I can't tell you enough how good it feels to talk about what I've been through. It's like I'm being given permission to let it all go.  Think of surgery as another sh&?& box ticked. A step closer to the finish line. I found surgery so much more manageable than I had expected, but I can't compare my surgery to a MX. Some of my worry was over how would I look after. I am 7 months post surgery and Im dusting off my bikinis for a holiday next month. Whilst having treatment I could not envisage a holiday ever again.  You will get through surgery but you need to talk about your fears now. There is three more weeks to go and that's a long time of anxiety and worry which as you are saying, is having a knock on effect with sleep etc.  julia x",

Not only did I have a new kitchen but an extension to put the new kitchen in and for months I didn't even have a cooker And a postage stamp size work top. It's my pride and joy and a something that was only able to happen as I got breast cancer! Sounds weird but I had an insurance policy and was able to get my dream kitchen.  Every cloud huh...  The first holiday I had abroad after treatment had me really nervous but it ended up being just perfect and what I needed. I took emergency antibiotics with me as I've had Axilla clearance but had no problems at all. My skin was also well behaved in the sun but I did use a factor 50 on the affected boob.  Im off to Menorca Friday with my family.... The first family Holiday since I was diagnosed ❤️. A new kitchen and a holiday ..... Perfect . Julia xx",

The grades indicate how different the cells are from normal cells and gives and indication of how fast they will multiply. Grade 2 cells are not as fast growing as grade 3 cells. Stages of BC are measured on tumour size and how far the BC has travelled (lymph nodes, other organs etc)",

      "Content": "Hi dl99  Picc lines can be uncomfortable for the first 24 hours or so as you get use to them but being sore enough for pain relief sounds a bit severe. I was advised to have a warm hot water bottle put on it to help. i found it a pain at night but only for the first two nights. If the picc hole looks inflammed and/or red or your arm feels warm to touch or swollen you may have a problem So seek advice.  I don't think anyone of us could say we looked forward to chemo. It's a means to an end of BC and takes 4 months out of your life but you can make up for that lost time when you finish treatment. join in with the monthly chemo chat room where you can share your chemo journey. All the best. Julia X ",
