    "Content": "Don't they have a group of women who have gone through this exact thing that you can talk too? I know that many, many women here in the US are having both taken with reconstructive surgery done to have \"peace of mind\". So different from 20 years ago when there was no reconstructive surgery, but now it seems to be much better in that regard. It would seem that there were be some patients at the hospital who have gone through it in the past that could be so helpful to you now that they have come out the other side and aren't in the mind numbing part of the journey you are in now that could be quite helpful. They talk a lot on this site about Macmillan nurses there, perhaps they are the ones who could help you talk through your choices and decision. This is a good site and suspect some people will be responding to you soon more specifically. You're in our prayers. - Lori",
