    "Content": "Screening varies so much in different areas! I had a routine mammogram at 47 which was clear. I then moved to a different area and at 50 had what would have been my first check. This showed a small tumour which has now been removed.  My BCN said I would not have felt this lump through self examination. Margins and sentinel nodes were clear. I didn't need chemo and I'm now in the middle of radiotherapy and on tamoxifen. My oldest sister's first mammogram also at 50 showed a similar picture. She also had successful treatment with surgery and radiotherapy. If our cancers had not been caught early we might both have needed the same treatment as our 3rd sister. At 51 she found a lump. She wasn't due for screening for another 2 years. She ended up having full mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy, and is on tamoxifen too.  It's so short sighted not to screen earlier. Not only is it obviously better for us if cancer is found before it has developed too far, but surely could save money for the NHS in the longer term by reducing the treatments needed. ",
