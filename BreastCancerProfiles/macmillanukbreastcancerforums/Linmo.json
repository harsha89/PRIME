      "Content": "Wide awake once more because I'm in so much pain and can't take any pain relief as had my maximum dose within a 24 hour period. Steroid injection in my hip scheduled for Thursday but not confident that they know what is really causing all this. It's over a year since I finished active treatment and just when I thought I was back to normal this happens. Still not convinced there isn't a link to the Letrozole. Going to be a long wait until 29th October when I have my breast clinic referral. Anyway will have a good cry and take a deep breath and push on with things as not really got an option. Will just have to keep everything crossed that this steroid injection brings some relief from the pain.",

You experience sounds very similar to mine I was originally told it was a sciatica issue but have become more and more debilitated now walking with stick is the only way I can get about. I did think about contacting the breast care nurses and discussing this with them to get a second opinion.

They've also told me to make sure they give me stronger analgesia to help me to deal with the pain. Thanks for all your advice and hopefully things will begin to improve now.",

I was prescribed Risedronate in conjunction with the Letrozole so also taking calcium booster. I'm taking the Accord brand of Letrozole but do know that the manufacturer merged with another company a while ago and I did wonder if the content of them may have changed as the last batch as packaging and look of them seems a little different. Have had to stay off work today as just don't feel up to going in which is not great. Last thing I need is to lose my job!",
