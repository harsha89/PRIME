    "Content": "Hi Jo I don't usually engage in messaging on this forum but I must stress that I found it a bit of a lifeline through out my treatment. I finished chemo at the end of March and radio in May. I felt I must give you some encouragement as I can identify with your current situation, i can tell you that within one month of finishing chemotherapy I felt so much better, radio has its own challenges mainly as it's everyday and makes you feel tired but where chemotherapy is a 10 I would put radio at a 1 for discomfort. Nearly 3 months on from chemotherapy now and I feel a different person, nearly gave up at the time but so glad I never. If you can push through for your last one please try, as soon as it was over I knew I would be on the up each week after and that feeling is wonderful, knowing that you have given this awful time in your life everything you have got and come through it. I wish you all the very best Jo, this is one of the hardest times in your life and you are getting there now, you are not alone. Love Jackie xx",
