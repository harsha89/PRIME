      "Content": "Hi. I've been on Tamoxifen for just over 4 weeks and my eyes have become bloodshot and sore. I went to my Dr who has prescribed two lots of eye drops to use as my eyes have become very dry. He didn't  comment when I asked if it  was due to the Tamoxifen. I have just started radiotherapy and my children have broken up for half term and I am feeling very low.My eyes hurt watching the TV and reading.I looked at other sites re Tamoxifen side effects and a lot of the 'posts' were sore, irritated eyes and  cataract problems which when they went to the Optician were told probably due to Tamoxifen. So what should I do now? Worried sick about eye sight now.......Does anyone have any suggestions? x",

      "Content": "Dear Tinkers Interesting you should say note the brands of Tamoxifen each time. The brand I was given at the hospital has only 2 E numbers in it whilst the brand from my GP has 6 E numbers in it and the fillers varied....... .I've had dry and irritated eyes since starting the 6 E numbers brand.Maybe there's a connection? Will also purchase fish oil capsules and make an appointment at opitician to see what's occuring. Will ask GP/Oncologist if I could possibly try another brand to try and eliminate eye problems. Many thanks for the post.",
