      "Content": "I'm 40 and was diagnosed with 2cm breast cancer (HER2-/ER+) 10 days ago and I'm due to have a therapeutic mamoplasty on Monday. Has anyone else had similar? What was your recovery like? I'm nervous about the pain and nervous about how much breast tissue will be left (currently an F cup). Any advice welcome.",

      "Content": "I'm so sorry you and your mum are having to deal with this. Both your and your mum's reactions sound completely normal. Keep talking to her about things, maybe introduce her to this forum so she can see how other people are dealing with a similar diagnosis. I found talking helps but I didn't want to bore people, so letting your mum know you want to talk will help.  The waiting is always the worst, if you have questions about future treatments talk to your breast care nurse. I found I was only told about the next step until I asked, I think they don't want to overload you with too much info. Take care and let us know how it goes.",

I'm told that the tiredness will continue to get worse for the next 2 weeks then improve. Has anyone else continued to work throughout treatment? Should I ask work if I can take a week off? Where do I get a sick note from? PS I'm 40 so thought I was young enough to escape without stopping work completely.",
