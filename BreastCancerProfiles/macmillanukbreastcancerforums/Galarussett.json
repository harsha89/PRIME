The anxiety and upset I've felt over the past few weeks can be nothing compared to what you brave and feisty ladies have been through. Thanks for your time and best wishes to you all. Xx",

      "Content": "Was hoping to get some advice if possible. I had my first routine mammogram, was called back last week had biopsy and am due to go for the results tomorrow. I'm going by myself as my husband has to collect the children from school and to be honest I feel I want to be by myself anyway. Ive absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to be asking. Am off the scale worried, despite being calm for everyone else. Any suggestions would be fab. Thanks so much.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your best wishes. When I had the biopsy, he told me it was 120 mm and try not to be too concerned. I asked, so it's not cancer then and he said to wait for the results, so he didn't really give me any clues.  Your right, I should take my husband for support and another pair of ears,  so I will try to sort alternative school transport for my children. Whatever the outcome, this whole experience this far has been such a leveller and made me reevaluate my priorities. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Yout bound to worry, just wanted to say that for me the procedure was fairly ok. I had injection of lidocaine to numb the area, and didn't feel any pain just pressure where they were looking. Only discomfort was where the nurse held a cotton pad firmly against my breast afterwards to reduce bruising, in fact there was just a tiny mark, so worked well. I was so lucky that the biopsy showed my lump was nothing. Good luck x",
