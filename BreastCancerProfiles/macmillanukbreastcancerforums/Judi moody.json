      "Content": "Hi, I have just recently joined this group and really wish I had found it earlier. I finished 5 weeks of radiotherapy on Monday and also had 6 sessions of chemo, 3 fed and 3 dose taxol. I had a lump removed last august and also my nipple, then 2 weeks later I had my nodes removed. When you look back you wonder how you find the strength, but you do and you come out the other side. I was in hospital over Christmas with a bad cold, that was hard on my family, 13year old daughter and 21year old son, plus my husband, at the time I was in the right place for how I was feeling. Reading posts from people who are starting on their journey reminds me of things I had forgotten. If you like to cook I used to make a few things for the freezer the week before my next treatment as I didn't feel to bad that week. I am losing my nails, but only losing them now, 8weeks after my last treatment. If your having radiotherapy put plenty of cream on as you do get redder as time goes on. Best wishes to everybody and don't forget to treat yourself every now and then, anybody who comes through this journey is special. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi there, I was in your position last July, and it is devastating at the time. I cried buckets but at the same time didn't want to let my friends and family see how upset I was. Once your treatment starts things, I think, get a bit better because you know something is being done. Even now after all my treatment is finished I feel as if the whole thing wasn't real and a lot of it is a bit of a blur. You will find the strength to get through. Accept all the help you can get and know there is light at the end of the tunnel. I too had my lymph nodes removed and it's ok, you will get plenty of advice from your breast care nurse. This is a great site and I'm sure you will get many more posts. Know that we have all been were you are now and we are still here. Best wishes, judith",

As for your allotment you just need to be careful with cuts and scratches on the arm that you got your nodes out, it's to do with infection. It is really important to do your exercises. And also to massage your arm. Xx",

It does seem very final and I did have a bit of a wobbly day last week. I've kept myself busy and got out for coffee and the odd walk. Hope this helps, Xx",

I know when I don't get enough sleep everything seems worse. It sounds to me as if you very brave and positive over the last year, maybe you need a wee melt down, crying can be very therapeutic . Don't be too hard on yourself. Sending you a big hug, Judith xx",

I had a lumpectomy last August and lymph node clearance two weeks later, then chemo which finished in late January and five weeks of rads which finished on 24th march. I've been doing my excercises most days and massaging my arm everyday but I still feel swollen under my arm and around my scar, is this normal. I had started to wear my old bras again which are under wired and wondered if this had anything to do with it. Thanks Xx",

I went to the look good, feel better a few weeks ago and it was a great afternoon, I collected my 13year old daughter on the way home and lost a few things to her. I never was good at wearing make up every day but I've started to lately and it does help, especially the eyebrow pencil. My hair is getting a good length but I still put a hat on when I go out as it's too cold yet. I'm looking forward to going topless soon. Enjoy the rest of the weekend. Xx",

Your doctors know what they are doing, you just have to trust them. Try and take one day at a time and listen to your body. Keeping a diary of how you are feeling is a good idea, then you can look back and see each time. Take care, Judith xx",
