    "Content": "Hi All I have just started Chemotherapy, (I had mastectomy in Oct 08', the tumour had spread to lymph & further clearance operation required) and the first chemo treatment has been no worse than a bad stomach bug - long may that continue! I have looked into the pro's and cons of chemo' and although I have decided to go with the medics (mainly because of possible spread through the body) I wondered if any of you ladies have backed up your decision to not have chemo with 'alternative' therapies. I have been finding acupuncture very helpful thoughout my treatment. By opening the chakra's in the body and allowing the flow of energies, healing can take place. This of course must only be done be an experienced and trained individual. I have been lucky enough to find a Japanese lady who was a consultant osteopath before taking up accupuncture who is absolutely wonderful and I would thoroughly reccommend (if anyone lives near Harrogate in North Yorkshire). I would be very pleased to hear from anyone who has taken thier health into thier own hands, not only just during the period of 'illness' but also long term to hopefully avoid reoccurance in the future. I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. xx",
