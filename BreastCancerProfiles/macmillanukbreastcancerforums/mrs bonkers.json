      "Content": "I am a woman of 43 yrs of age with two kids.  I have a dull aching pain in both breasts, this is also accompanied with a bright red ring around the nipples and blotchy redness which expands an 1 inch past this - again bilateral.  I also have a fever which comes and goes and I generally do not feel well. This is not a rash.  It is coming from inside both breasts.  I am not pregnant.  My doctor has never seen anything like this before and is concerned so she is sending me off to see a breast specialist next week. I am literally terrified.  Both my sisters have had breast cancer (one of which died and she was only in her late 20's) so I know I am at high risk of developing cancer.  I have yearly mammograms and ultra sounds (last one was at Easter) and I am also on Tamoxifen. I have had an undiagnosed autoimmune condition for the past 3 years and I am wondering if this may be connected or that I do infact have IBC.   Please does anyone know what it could be?",
