    "Content": "I had 4 doses of this poison back in 2008 when I had my first cancer. I truly feel for you all! The bone and joint pain was intense, I lost all my finger and toe nails, then it perforated my bowel!! Had to have lots of surgeries with colostomies. Please, please look after your bowels whilst you're on this drug. Take it one dose at a time...if it gets too much, they can reduce the dose a bit, but do finish the course. Rest when you can, let others carry the slack. You will get past this...we're all with you. Xxx",
