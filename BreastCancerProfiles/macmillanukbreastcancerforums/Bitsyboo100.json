    "Content": "Hi there Mum and Mia, I have just had a mastectomy on the 5th July ......your experience might not be exactly the same .....but here is my experience.... I had 1 breast removed and my husband saw on the board in the ward where I was admitted that my operation would last 111 mins.  I spent some time in recovery so all in all it lasts about 2 to 3 hours with recovery. I too had sentinel node removal. I did not take a mastectomy bra with me as I had a couple of drains still attached and after the operation I went home with one drain still in place, which was removed 5 days after the operation.  My dressing was left on for 7 days and then taken off. I just kept the hospital gown on overnight and was glad to go home the following day.   Still early days and I am quite numb in the mastectomy area.  I have a fantastic breast cancer nurse who I phone if I am concerned about anything and hopefully you will get a contact breast cancer nurse who you can ask all your questions to.  Hope this helps.....",
