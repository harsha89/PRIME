I agree with you when you say that you wonder he you find the strength to go through the treatment when it is so overwhelming at the beginning but as you said anybody who comes through this journey is special, very special indeed. I was diagnosed in July 2011 at 32 years old and in three years my life has changed beyond recognition: after lumpectomy, ANC, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and Herceptin my biggest blessing was to become a mother in June 2013 and my precious little boy is prof that we can surpass all the challenges that cancer throw at you and still find true happiness and joy in life amid so many challenges. There is life after cancer we just need to keep on fighting. Love Susy",

I had it inserted with a local anesthetic and sedation last November. Had to be careful the first week, no brisk movements, stiff neck  and was a bit sore, but after that no pain. It is worth it, for me it was and still have been as I am having herceptin. Take care  Susy",

      "Content": "Hi Joanne, I think you should to your BCN or other oncologist at your hospital about the fertility aspect. I was diagnosed last July at 32 years old and not only her but my oncologist spoke to me about conserving my eggs eventhough at the time I didn't think about it. I was so shocked that I am glad that they mentioned it and I was referred to a fertility specialist. As my onc knew that I was married with no children, that was her priority after my op. She was happy to delay my treatment for a couple of months so the eggs could be collected. I was supposed to have 3 FEC and 3 other that  I can't remember the name but because my white blood cells were getting lower and lower each time and the latter 3 the effects on fertility are not known and its even worse for the white blood cells, my onc gave us the option of deciding if we wanted to go ahead with the initial treatment or change it for FEC only, so I decided of having just FEC and had 5 cycles instead of 6, as with 5 I had the dose that I was supposed to have anyway.  In my family there are no cases of breast cancer, apart from me and my older sister that was diagnosed even younger than me at 28, so my onc is going to refer me for a genetic study to see if I have mutations on the BRCA1 or BRCA2. Press on it as it is very important to you and because your fertility is being put at risk because of cancer you can have the fertility treatment or even an initial discussion on the NHS and they are very quick to make appointments. I had mine 1 week after speaking to my onc. All the best Susy",

In the hospital the radiologist (i think this is was they are called) will give aqueous cream that I put twice a day or when I felt I needed more.On the weekend I used to put a thick layer of the cream and let it stay until as long as I could until I had a shower to keep the skin really moisturised. It really helped. Well my breast looked like it had gone on holiday and the rest of my body had stayed at home LOL. Finished radiotherapy 2 weeks ago, still is a bit dark but slowly peeling and new skin is cominh up, but it does not hurt. Something that I think really helped was the exercises I was given to do after the operation and I made sure that I could move my arm as before the surgery, cause it tends to cause your joins to become stiff.

I don't regret it because it allowed me to loose my hair at a slower pace - my personal choice - but I know that some people don't like the fact that you are loosing it slowly, they prefer to loose it straight away. It was nor stressful for me to loose it this way as it allowed me slowly to get used to the idea that eventually I would go bald. My hair was very long and curly and I cut it shoulder lenght after the 2nd as I was getting some bald patches and with shorter hair people did not notice the baldness. Then after my 3rd, cut it shorter and then after the 5th I had it shaved, which I cry but got used to it.  Everybody has different opinions regarding the use of cold cap and I think you should do what is comfortable and what feels right for you.  All the best with your decision.",

      "Content": "Hi Carole, The cold cap has a 50/50 chance of working. I was in the 50% that didn't. However, I don't regret using it. I managed to keep most of my hair just before my 5th cycle. It started falling slowly just before my 2nd cycle but at least I kept my hair for most of the time. I cut it short twice and as my hair was curly, people didn't notice my patches, in reality people were saying how good I looked with my new haircut. Just before my last cycle, my hubby shaved my hair and it was tough but as I dealt with it slowly it wasn't a shock for me but I think it depends on how you deal with things. I think it was good for me as your body goes through so much that keeping your hair for longer helps you to feel more normal. I lost my body hair just before my 2nd and it was good not to have to shave LOL. After that I used headscarves and my two wigs - was lucky enough to get one like my normal hair and one short from my sister.  You have to stay for longer when having your chemo and you might have headaches because of it I only had it the first time and if you do have it take conditioner with you as I helps to draw out humidity from the folicles and also so your hair doesn't get stuck onto the cap. I finished my chemo at the end of Jan and my hair is growing now, looking forward to stop using wigs and headscarves now. Hope it helps, xxx Susy",

All the best for Monday xxxx P.S: If you suffer for constipation like me (it was awful) there are some natural chewable cubes really good. I was given Senna on my 2nd cycle in the hospital but it didn't work. Then on my 3rd cycle they gave me the syrup thing really sweet that I would have to take almost half of the bottle to have some bowl movement so I gave up. Then I discovered this cubes they are from Ortis an are called Fruits & Fibres and after my 3rd cycle I started take them on the 1st day of chemo and it was a relief!!!!!",

Like you I work in a school as a HLTA and went back last April after being away since September 2011. You look at your work with different eyes and approach it differently, eventhough you are still at the same job. The children are so good at putting a smile in your face and they notice the difference. For example, when I went back in April my hair was still very short and I decided to use hats and headscarves and made that part of my \"new look\". The children that I had work with the previous year were Y5 and one of them asked if I had converted to Islam - please take no offence about this whoever is reading - and I just said that I decided to change my style and look. Many of them came to me saying how much they have missed me and what had happened to me, all sort of questions as you can imagine. Returning in september I decided to let my hair out as it is about 2/3 inches long and curly and while I was telling off a child during playtime, she was staring at me and I thought to myself what is wrong with her. She looked into my eyes and really loud and stern she said:\"Miss why did you cut your hair?\" OMG for a few seconds I didn't know what to say as she was only 5 years old  when I left for my treatments and she still remember how I used to look. Just be really careful as your immune system will be a wreck. Never had a cold or infection while doing chemo and that lasted almost a year. As soon I went back had a throat infection where I lost my voice completely and first day the children were in last week caught a cold got better but this week got worse and I am still sneezing a lot and caughing.

Everything has been fine until last December when out of the blue I started to feel some pain under my affected breast by the ribs like someone had punched me. After a week or so the pain disappeared. Then last month out came back and as it didn't get better I started to worry and when I looked in the mirror and I put my arm up I could see and feel 2 veins quite hard like when you have cording and it was painful to touch and just putting my arm up without touching was very painful. Got an appointment with GP a few days later and eventhough the pain got less and better my GP was puzzled as he has never seen anything like it. He said that he doesn't think is cancer related but sent me for a scan which will b at the end of this month. Had a mammogram last week which made the pain come back and will see oncologist which btw I'm dreading..... Has anyone experienced something similar? Thanks Susy",

I had chemo from October to January, had radio mid February to mid March and started Herceptin at the end of March. When I went back it was agreed with my employer - I am a higher level teaching assistant - to go back on a staggered return, so I started working 3 days a week.  My energy levels are better than when I was having chemo, but they are nowhere closer to what they were before. As many of you here are TAs, you know that it is a very demanding job, phisically and mentally so I am struggling to keep up as my brain says that I can do it but my body is saying take it easy. Also in my school appearence is very important so we need to look the part, more like an office so need to look good and with my hair now about 2/3 inches it does help and also need to make sure that my pimples - reactio from the Herceptin - are well disguised. I find that with Herceptin I feel quite tired the day I have it and I need to sleep it off to get it out my system. By the time I am almost 100% here comes the next one. Also my immune system is still messed up from chemo, catching all the bugs from the children, the last 2 weeks have been really tough and winter is not here, don't want to think how it will be during that time. I was hoping of going on full-time in September but I am still doing 3 days a week. I am quite lucky as I am getting full-time pay instead of part-time so have no preassure of getting less money so normal stress levels on this departement. All I can say to you is to take it as it comes and don't push yourselves beyond you can. Susy",

After having chemo (finished end of Jan) don't know how my fertility is and can't think of children in the next couple of years.   So, eventhough it was hard telling your children, you are blessed by having them in your life.

What you are describing happened to me and when  I went for my 3rd chemo as my arm was a bit swollen and painful the nurses refused to give me chemo and I was referred to have a porth-a-cath inserted and that was the best thing that had happened during this whole thing.  It took a good 2 months for my arm to kinda come back to normal and at the moment my wedding ring still doesn't fit but at least my arm is not in pain and this arm is the one that had to do everything relating to carrying bags and lift things.  Hope you are better now Susy",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy I was 32 when I was diagnosed and eventhough I easily married I did not want to wait for the fertility treatment so I had chemo after lumpectomy and ANC. My husband agreed also with that as it was a joint decision and it as one the hardest decisions we had to make as just before I was diagnosed we r planningon startinga family. I resigned myself to b just the 2 of us. Then when I was half way through herceptin found out I was pregnant. We were very anxious as we did not know if the treatment would've  affected our unborn baby but my oncologist was very supportive. She said that as I was offered the possibility of having herceptin for 6 months  but had chosen to have 12 months in reality I had almost 8 months so stopping it would not make much of a difference. Our miracle baby is now 15 months old and he developing really well. Hope my story gives u some hope if u decide not to have the fertility treatment. BTW my older sister also had BC  and she did not have fertility treatment and she has a 20 month boy and shes pregnant with a baby girl who will arrive by the end of November Susy",

      "Content": "Hi ladies Haven't posted for a long time but hav been reading the posts and I had to add something. Apart from the obvious that most of us hear, the worst I heard was from my boss and to think that he is a headmaster what influence he's having in young minds it actually scares me. After returning to work being away for 9 months during the majority of my treatment I was wearing head scarves and he found it hard to see me with my head covered. After 6 weeks of of holidays went back with my short hair. He was amazed and his compliment was \"well I'm sure you are cancer free because you hair is growing. If you still had cancer you hair would not grow\". Needless to say I was in shock with his ignorance and refused to reason with someone like him. Also during chemo went for the regular blood tests and had priority over everybody that was waiting to have the blood tests done and a man in his 60s starting complaining that a young person like me could not wait like everybody else - was 32 at the time - and started a scene in a pretty busy rroom well I said to him that I wouldn't mind swapping with him as I had cancer and he probably had something that could wait. He did not say a word.",

You can take half of one but I had one whole and it did the trick. Good recovery  Susy xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Irene, I also was neutropenic throughout my chemo but not as bad as you and never had to stay in hospital. During those days I was really careful with what I ate and it helped. I had plenty of the following every day and never missed a treatment: beetroot fresh greens carrots papaya tomatoes brussels sprouts watercress spinach broccoli red, yellow pepers butternut squash fish I bought a fruit juicer so I could juice carrot with beetroot, papaya, and other fruits. At the end I had to force myself to have beetroot I got sick of it but it really helped. So any fruit or vegetable that is yellow, red or dark green is good to raise white blood cells. Hope it helps and good recovery Susy xxx",
