    "Content": "Dear Jasmine I had a bilateral mastectomy in September 08. I was determined to get through the surgery and survive the Breast Cancer. I kept busy by making homemade cards and sold them for Charity. I found this very therapeutic and concentrating on the designs of the cards made me forget about my illness. You can buy the materials very cheaply in the £ shop and a magazine in the supermarket showing how to make different cards or a book from the library.  I strongly believe if you can remain positive you will get through the surgery and treatment much easier. A pain Nurse came to see me and told me she had attended a course where the Speaker was a Cancer Consultant. He said the most important thing after a diagnosis was to focus and remain positive. He said that everyone had a choice:- 'you can survive or you can surrender' The choice is yours!!. I thought this statement was wonderful guidance for anyone with Cancer and I have told several people since who also found it very helpful. I do hope your members will also find it helpful too. Kind regards Anne",
