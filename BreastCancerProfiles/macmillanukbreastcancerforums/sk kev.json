      "Content": "Hello Lellis, Welcome to the site, and in the nicest possible way wish you weren\u2019t here! it's a horrible thing that brings us all here, I can't say whether it's any different than the NHS, never been private myself but all my treatment was just as planned out on the NHS only choice I had was if I turned up or not and that's no choice at all! and as for support well my GP was better than anyone I spoke to at Hospital for that matter, no seven mins max with her, she would have talked for ever I think, I have found this site very good for support from the people who know first hand what it's like to have Cancer or are caring for someone with it, don't think your going insane, it just feels like that at times stay on the site keep posting and you will find people care and are willing to support you, even if you just want a moan, take care, xx Kev. ps, most on here can spell too(unlike me lol)  ",
