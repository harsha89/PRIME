      "Content": "Wow I'm blown away by all the support on here. We have been trying to have some \"normal\" time before all the mayhem of treatment etc starts. My wife read the comments on here on Thursday and was defo lifted by what she read. Thanks again to everyone who has taken the time to respond. We had a day at the House of Fraser today spending our wedding vouchers and we only managed to spend less than a third of what we were given!! We have some very special friends and family so have a great support network. We are meeting with a girlfriend tomorrow who went thru the exact same diagnosis and treatment as we have had. I've known her since I was 4 and her bro was my best man so we are very close. I'll keep posting but maybe take a small timeout till post op. Love n hugs to you all. Chris xxxx",

      "Content": "First time poster here today and to be honest I feel a little scared by what I've read. My wife was diagnosed 2 days before our wedding on the 31st Jan. Massive shock and could nt believe it had happened to us. Told only 2 people before the wedding so we could have wedding of our dreams. We achieved this and had a fantastic day followed by an amazing honeymoon. Still not sure how we did it but we did! My wife has stage 2 breast cancer that has moved to the lymphs under her arm. Bloods and bone scan revealed it has not moved.we had a meeting today to discuss our treatment program which starts on Tuesday with a left breast mastectomy and removal of lymph nodes. My wife has been amazing and is seemly taking it in her stride. She is so strong and I'm very proud of her. I'm kind of worried that the full impact of what is happening has not fully hit us yet. Has anyone felt this way at this stage before?? We have a ton of support and also a few friends that are at different stages of their cancer treatment journey. Any replies would be most welcome xx",

      "Content": "Wow thanks guys for the responses. I needed to add that we are having reconstruction on Tuesday to with a silicone implant. Have also been told the skin is good so hopefully the nipple will survive which is a big issue with my wife. Obviously there are possibilities the nipple may not survive but will deal with that later if we need. Thanks again for listening xxx",
