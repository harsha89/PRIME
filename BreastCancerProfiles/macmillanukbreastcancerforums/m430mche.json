    "Content": "I have completed FEC and use a cold cap. I had shoulder length hair but had it cut to a shorter style before I started the treatment. My hair has thinned and I have had two hair cuts ( cutting it shorter each time) during the treatment!!!! Ended up with no eyebrows but still have hair and even had people admire my NEW hair styles. During the treatment I washed my hair only twice a week maximum, didn't use any styling products and occasionally use a hair dryer. Don't know whether this helped or not.  Your activity levels will depend on your individual response to treatment. I found in the inital stages of treatment i was able to maintain some social acitivity but the cumulative effect of the chemo left me doing less and less with each treatment.",
