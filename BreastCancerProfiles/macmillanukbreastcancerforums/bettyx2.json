    "Content": "Hi Blossom, I am in the same position as you. I had lumpectomy, Radiotherapy and then Arimidex starting lasting April 2008,My first symptons were hair loss, then terrible joint pains especially in hands and hips (v.bad) things have eased off now, but my knees and feet do get puffy. My mis-shapened left boob is also hard and tender were they took tumours out and i suppose also must have water retention as when i take bras off i have a deep line from the shape of the cup every time,It is only reading comments on this site can we all gauge what is normal. I had my first mammogram since op last Tuesday and see surgeon next week, unless something nasty shows up..I am also very anxious. Good luck with your meetings,",
