My hands have become very dry and he skin is starting to crack which looks rather unsightly but at present isn't painful. Can anyone suggest a good cream to use, I've previously been using garnier intensive repair but this doesn't seem to be having any effect now.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Many thanks, Carole xXx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone,  I was diagnosed with breast cancer March 2015. Had 8 rounds of chemo, 3 operations including mastectomy and 15 rounds of radiotherapy all completed Jan 2016.  Then in April 2016 I found a small lump on my breast bone which has unfortunately come back as cancer along with three more below my mastectomy scar. My CT Scan shows no further spread so that good news but on speaking with my consultant yesterday she wants to refer me to see a plastic surgeon within the same hospital trust to see if I'm eligible to have a new chemo drug that is administered to the sight of the cancer instead of through a cannula as I had last time (sorry can't remember the name of it) to see if the cancer which is apparently just in the skin not in any other tissue can be reduced before surgery to remove the affected area. Has anyone heard of, or had this type of treatment.  I will need to have skin removed from my back to replace the affected skin in the breast area and apparently this at present will need to be quite large to cover from my breast bone to the middle of my side and the distance from the top of where my breast would be to the bottom.  My consultant is positive that this can be cured but also said she wasn't surprised that my cancer had returned due to the microscopic particles that where present in my breast tissue that lead to the need for the mastectomy.  Hope you are all well.  Carole xXx",

It's 10 months since I worked and she said before I got my results that if I'm working then I have to give 100%. In other words mistakes will not be tolerated. I work in a bank and understand this but I feel like I still have chemo brain if that's possible (finished chemo 26/8/15 8 cycles 2ec and 6 docetaxil) concentration is terrible and I'm tired, apart from that I'm doing ok. I have also had 3 operations the last one mastectomy 30/10/15 She has said I can do a phased return to work (hours etc not yet discussed) but she has said things in the past and then changed her mind. I feel like I'm being pressured into returning to work my sick note runs out 9/2/16.  Any advice and or questions to ask would be appreciated. Sorry if this is garbled it's how my brain works at the moment. Caz xXx",

I also bought a PICC line cover as apposed to using the bandage the hospital supplied as like DianaC said the bandage rolled up and made it quite tight on the area it had rolled. Both I ordered from livebetterwith.com they are not too expensive approx £37 for both.  Hope this helps and all goes well for you. ",

Can I use a nail file especially for tops of nails to smooth them out or would I be doing more damage to them, my nails are also lifting from the top but seem to be growing out gradually.

This is usually done with a local anaesthetic but as have numerous tumours they were giving me a general instead but hopefully it would have only needed one or two treatments and at my hospital anyway it is done by a plastic surgeon with consent from an oncologist.  Carole xXx",

I will get my life back. 16 months since I've worked and I'm determined to go back even if it is part time rather than full time.  It must be extremely difficult having this disease and running your own business but it sounds like you have a fab partner taking some of the strain.  Hope you have a fab holiday where are you going?

They have a full building dedicated to cancer and even a hotel on the top floor for patients families (usually children's I think).  I will try take notes and see what they say but as far as I'm aware the chemo is two types carboplatin and paclitaxel which will be done weekly as apposed to three weekly as I had before. The ask a nurse seemed to think that this was the right drug to give for my situation it I'll find out more tomorrow.  Sounds like your holiday is at present a bit of a logistical nightmare but I'm sure it will be amazing when you get there.

As suggested last week we are going with the weekly chemotherapy.  He said after an examination that it's a very aggressive form of breast cancer and the sooner we start the chemo the better. Could not give me a time line for how long this would be for but I'll now take it as it comes.  Due to me having serious thrush in my mouth last time and side effects from the two types of chemo both include thrust he will give me something to try and prevent it but if it's like last time it could possibly be constant as I had it for 11 days out of the 21 day cycle. So not really looking forward to that.  Loosing my hair won't be a problem as it hasn't grown back from last time (11 months today since my last chemo).  Have decided to pull on my big girl pants and just take it as it comes at the end of the day I'm still here and smiling How are you doing, has your fatigue got any better?

Five months later I notice a small lump which as I said above is now 9 tumours in three short months.  My surgery consultant said it was skin cancer and a local Reacurrance which as I understand it is because it's in the same area and that it was not as serious as what I'd already been through, therefore treatable. CT scan showed no further spread anywhere in my body.  I don't remember what if anything the oncologist said about it think I may have shut down when he said control not cure. The only thing I could think then was I'm going to die. Feeling very low at the moment as I don't know what to do.  Hope your injection goes well and thank you for looking at the leaflets.

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn,  Hope the fatigue doesn't last too long. I agree side effects should all be listed no matter how rare they are so that everybody knows what to possibly expect even though I know this probably isn't very practical  I had a reply from ask a nurse today and I'm feeling much better about everything. This is what she said: no you haven\u2019t rambled. It sounds like the last 3 months have been really tough and I\u2019m not surprised you feel like you\u2019re losing the plot. It might be helpful to talk to your breast care nurse about what your hospital team are hoping to achieve with your treatment. Unfortunately breast cancer that has spread to the skin can\u2019t be cured but can be controlled with treatment. Your oncologist has mentioned having a meeting and talking to your other consultants, this is called a Multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) and allows the doctors to get together to discuss your condition and treatment options. Your surgeon is expert in surgery, your oncologist is expert in cancer treatments and the plastic surgeon is expert in electrochemotherapy. They need to get together and explore the potential benefits of each treatment. After they\u2019ve done this, they\u2019ll recommend the treatment that will be the most effective. Sometimes two treatments can be equally effective, in which case you\u2019ll be involved in making the decision as to which treatment you\u2019d prefer. It might be useful to talk through what\u2019s happening, we\u2019re available on our free helpline number 0808 808 0000 between 9am and 8pm from Monday to Friday. Best wishes, Karla (Macmillan Information Nurse Specialist). Best wishes Carole xXx",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Yeah I agree. The oncologist I saw I've never seen him before and the breast care nurse wasn't the one I normally deal with and she kept going back to the electrochemotherapy still being a possibility but as I've gone from 1 tumour to 9 in three months don't really want to think about how many there could be when the bleomycin is available again.  Each consultant or doctor I've seen has given me conflicting information, I understand that my situation changes each time but I would have thought that some of what's said would be the same.  Thank you for all your help it is very much appreciated.  Carole xXx",

After a 5.30am start for hospital appointment at 9am (public transport) I am finally back home.  I have had two ultrasound scans and they have taken a biopsy of the lump. Very painful with no local anaesthetic due to the size.  They are unable to tell me what the lump is and so have to wait another week or two to see what the results are from the biopsy. Hope everyone is well. Love and hugs to all Carole xXx",

I'm hoping it's nothing serious don't think I could go through chemo again just yet as its only just over 8 months since my last one finished and 3 since rads, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it. On a positive note though can't loose my hair again as it hasn't grown back yet lol.  Carole xXx",

The mastectomy scar is not raised or painful whereas the lump is extremely painful to touch. My doctor has referred me back to the hospital as he doesn't know what it it but I'm not there until Wednesday next week. I'm so scared the cancer has come back. First time round it was ok let's do what needs to be done and I had a very positive attitude but know I'm struggling to cope.  Carole xXx",
