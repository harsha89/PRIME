We have done this race for the last 5 years and was determined to not miss one. Now I am thinking about training up again and doing the great north run this year, mead a goal to keep me training. Still got 13,Herceptin to go and on tamoxifen but the worst over so now looking forward. I definitely think keeping fit helped me through the treatment.",
