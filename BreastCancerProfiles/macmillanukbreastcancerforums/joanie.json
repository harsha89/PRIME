      "Content": "I am just finding my way around the site so I hope this message is heading in the right direction. I was diagnosed with primary cancer in the breast and secondary cancer in the bones and lungs in October 2011. I had been for my 3 yearly mammogram exam in May 11 but nothing was seen in the results.The cancer was only found when I discovered a lump on the site of a previous fibroadenoma scar. I have not had any surgery. I have had chemotherapy and a couple of sessions of radiotherapy. I am currently taking a hormone suppressant Exastemene and a bisphosphonate that is hopefully helping the bones. I had to come off Letrozole because I was having so much pain in my joints. Presently I am experiencing numbness and stiffness in my hands. Can anyone advise how they have dealt with simllar symptoms .Thanks for coming back to me",

      "Content": "Hi Beevergirl, I am sorry to hesr that you are experiencing side effects from the hormonal suppressant medication you are taking. I am post menopausal and was given the hormone suppressant Letrozole, which made every joint in my body ache and made me feel as if I was going down with flu all of the time. I discussed the problem with the Oncologist and BCN's and we agreed that I would continue taking the tablet for a few weeks to see if the side effects lessened. They didn't - so I ceased taking the tablets for a couple of weeks to just make sure it was the medication that was causing the problem. It was - so my oncologist started me on an alternative medication Exastemene - which has proved to be much better in terms of not getting aching joints and flu like symptoms. However another side effect has been carpal tunnel syndrome but that is also improving after a steroid injection and wearing a wrist support. I think we need to be active in our treatment and have found that the medical professionals have been open to this. I hope things improve for you Kind wishes Joanie",

      "Content": "Hi Lopseygoldwig Many years ago I was diagnosed with Fibroadenoma, which was removed. In 2011 I noticed a lump in the scarring site of the original operation, which turned out to be cancer, unfortunately which had spread to bones and lungs. Your email made me wonder if Fibroadenomas were a precursor to cancer, even though they are originally diagnosed as benign. It's a thought. I wish you well in your treatment Joanie",

      "Content": "Hi ASB One down. How many more to go? When I had finished chemo CT scans showed that the mets in the lungs had improved and the mets in the bones had not got any worse, which I would consider reasonably successful. I go to a hospice nearby as a daycare patient on a weekly basis. I have counselling there, a range of therapies including acupuncture and reflexology, physio input and the chance to talk to people in a similar situation. I also had 'Toning' sessions which involved chanting, which I believe helped improve my lung capacity. The only problem is when I do it at home I wonder if the neighbours think I have gone loopy!! Anyway have a good rest and take care Joanie",

I wish I could help or advise you in all the ways you want to be helped/advised. All I feel fit for at the moment is to let you know that my thoughts are with you and everyone on this site. I gained sustenance from someone who responded to one of emails. It made me feel cared for even though they did not have the answers. Now what is the magic word that I can leave you with?????
