      "Content": "I really agree about the positivity thing, I think when people say that to me it is more for them than me. Being positive won't change my outcome. Nor will prayers.  But I think we need to give ourselves, our bodies and our health care workers  a huge amount of credit for the effort we are making to keep our cancers at bay. Even when we  dont feel like it our bodies are using their defence mechanisms to get rid of the cancer or at least to stop it growing. Our doctors and nurses and researchers are doing their best to find treatments that will help our bodies do that. Sadly sometimes it doesn't work and the cancer takes over but that is not for want of trying.  Our bodies are trying even when we feel we have nothing left to give. Not all wars are won but that doesn't make the soldiers any less strong, willing or brave. It just means the other side broke the rules and brought  a frigging nuclear missile.  We should feel proud of ourselves for getting through one more day against the adversity called Cancer  Love and hugs to you all xx",
