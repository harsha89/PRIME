      "Content": "Hi Ivorymummy. Sorry you have to join us, but please use the support to answer any questions .It is invaluable to get answers to questions from ladies who are going through or have gone through he same or very similar experience. I had a similar question about a holiday date booked.Obviously it very much depends on what happens at surgery as things can change then from what was expected. However I had my surgery on 23rd April ,had to wait 2+weeks for final results[delayed by one week] Saw oncologist on 14th May and he was happy to delay radiotherapy til 24th June after my holiday as long as had planning session before I went away ,it is tomorrow ! As my radiotherapy is for DCIS ,therefore more preventative than treatment he was OK with delay.[Actually start 9 weeks after surgey] Looks from your dates as though you wouldn't be due to start til after your holiday date. Hope this helps. Good luck with your surgery Judith",

      "Content": "Hi everyone who has joined in this discussion .As others have said it is so reasurring to know that others are feeling as I am. Finished rads just over 2 weeks ago ,struggling with tiredness and lack of motivation,probably linked to each other. As some one mentioned I also try to keep occupied so I don't have time to think about was happened,but tiredness restricts it sometimes . When I am resting the thoughts start whistling around in my mind. It all is frustrating and unsettling at the moment  and I just want to get back to some normality and be able to plan . I am also feeling tearful yesterday and today which haven't felt since initial diagnosis,don't know what has brought it on which is also unsettling. Sorry about the moan . Thanks for listening[reading]  Judith",

      "Content": "Hi Kay You have echoed how I felt and still do feel with a diagnosis of DCIS.[Had WLE and radiotherapy -25 sessions] Why do they call it pre-cancerous and then do invasive surgery and radiotherapy both of which have residual effects which are still troubling me 9 months post surgery and 6months post rads. I like you am very grateful that it was caught early and haven't had to have mastectomy or chemo and do feel sometimes that I am a fraud and should have \"got over it \"by now. However as others have said the sudden diagnosis is a trauma in itself not to mention any surgery or further treatment. I can sympathize totally with what you have said and are feeling. If you want to personal message please do so . Judith",

Not clever enough to put link in but  it is www.cancercounselling.org.uk/northsouth/extra4.nsf  well worth reading. Am going to have another look at it myself as feeling low at the moment due to not being able to get fitness back because of back and leg pains. Hey ho suppose in the grand scheme of things should be grateful, but don't always feel it. Judith",
