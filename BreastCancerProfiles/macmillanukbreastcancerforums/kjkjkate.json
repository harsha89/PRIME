    "Content": "I've only just joined this group, a year and a bit after diagnosis and around the one-year anniversary of my radiotherapy. Kerry, I hate that you're going through this but I'm glad you've been able to get it out and it definitely helps people like me know that I'm not alone, because so much of what you've said resonates. It's been a very lonely experience in a lot of ways. I've just had my one year mammo last month and I was a mess in the build up to it and waiting for results. It's huge and yet another scary step. But it's one step closer to a new normal. I kept telling myself \"it's just an opportunity to know more about my body\", so instead of shying away from looking at the screens and panicking inwardly the way I wanted to, I took an interest and asked tonnes of questions (I must have really annoyed them!) and it felt a bit more powerful that way. And I did come out of it feeling more in control of things - I was able to see the clips that marked where my tumour had been and realised how lucky I was to find it (that's another story!).  I think this year I've learned that even though going through the whole diagnosis / treatment is agony, the next year - the year when everything 'looks normal' is almost worse. No-one knows the silent hell you're going through and keep telling you that you look great and you've come through it and all that and would like it forgotten. But we'll never forget - I swear i still think about cancer every minute and can't imagine a point any time soon that it'll be any different - and it's such a lot to live with.  We have to keep being honest, find 'our' people who really get it (whether that's partners, close friends, counsellors, forums) and remember that a year is very little on the scale of things. It's very early days and in many ways  the journey has really just begun. Best of luck on Friday, Kerry. Thank you for making me feel less alone  Kate xxx",
