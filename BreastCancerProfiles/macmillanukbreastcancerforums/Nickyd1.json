      "Content": "It is a horrible feeling. My second treatment was definitely the worst as well and it took me a couple of weeks to recover. After that it was only a few days. So it does get better. I used to wear travel bands that I got from Boots, they activate pressure points in your wrists and they did help with that sea sickness feeling. I also chewed ginger sweets, from holland and Barretts or boots. And ate ginger biscuits. When I could manage to drink it mint tea helped. I did a lot of lying down listening to the radio so I still felt in touch with the world. I too got constipated and found lactulose helped, started taking it on day of my chemo. Preferred it to laxidos. Good luck to you, it is grim but you will come through it.",

      "Content": "Hi Squirrel, all I know is that everyone's circumstances are different and so everyone's treatment is different. Hospitals follow national guidelines so you will be getting the best treatment plan for you. I had the mx before the chemo but I know other women who have it the same way round as you and the chemo was very effective at shrinking the tumour. You could give the nurses on the Macmillan site a call, I have called when I wanted advice but didn't want to call the hospital. You can also call your breast care nurse, I find that the ones at my unit are able to explain things much better than the oncologist or surgeon, my mind goes blank when I go in appointment then they interpret what the dr told me! I think questioning treatment is good, shows you are looking after yourself. I always like to know why I am having treatment, before radiotherapy I made the radio therapists show me pictures of how my skin would look and really questioned him about side effects - think I wasn't in shock as I was with the chemo and surgery talks! Good luck xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Debs. Yes, I had the Mx with an LD flap reconstruction at the same time. My surgeon was happy for me to have any reconstruction I wanted before chemo and rads. He assured me that the rads would have limited impact on my recon, the main thing would be it would shrink it a bit or harden it. Nothing that couldn't be taken care of later! however before the surgery I went to a Breast Cancer Care younger womens forum and quite a few women had exactly the same treatment plan as you and warned me of the risk of rads ruining my recon. anyway I trusted the surgeon, went ahead with the recon. it has shrunk a bit but I going to have lipo modelling in the New Year, move fat from stomach to boob. My skin survived rads well, 15 sessions left me with a bit of a sun tan and a sore patch under my boob but it soon cleared up. The radio therapist said that modern rads are so much more effective and have less side effects. This is just my story Debs, as i said before everyone is different - you may be having more rads or the intensity may be higher? But if you are not happy with what the oncologist has said I recommend asking for a second opinion. My area has a multi disciplinary team, so lots of consultants looked at my results and came up with my treatment plan but my main contact has been with an onco plastic surgeon, I only saw the oncologist when I started chemo. Looking back the surgeon was very keen for me to have immediate reconstruction, I think he understood the psychological impact of having a mx and waiting for reconstruction later. X",

I think it's possible to do it yourself, relax for a few moments and then picture your bodies immune system as a little army, then picture the cancer cells running away, or so thing like that!

Panic attacks are a normal reaction to the stress you are experiencing and there are things you can do to help alleviate them.Is there a counsellor or nurse or gp you can talk to about your feelings? Friends and family often struggle to cope with the strong emotions that their loved ones go through. My sister is a Social Worker in a hospice and i remember even her telling me to 'be positive' when i was at my lowest ebb - not helpful but she struggled to hear me so low. I called the Macmillan and Breast Cancer Care helplines when I was at my lowest emotionally, I found it so helpful to talk things through with an impartial listener. Something else that helped was hypnosis from a friend and following a relaxation cd from the hospital. I also keep a journal and write down what is happening when i am low, it often makes me sob but i feel better after because trying to repress feelings doesn't help, they need acknowledging or they become overwhelming. Sending you lots of positive thoughts Xxx",

I said this to someone else with bc and she said that her oncologist had said that we are just unlucky, women have breasts, breast get cancer and sadly we are the ones with it. That thought stuck with me and I've stopped blaming myself for something that really I had little control over. Is there any help you can get, someone to talk to from a cancer centre? My area has a bc group and it helped me to know I wasn't the only one feeling the way I did. They also run activities to distract people! I also used to visit the drop in centre at my hospital where there was a lovely bunch of helpers ready to chat, I had a few cups of tea and a biscuit having a cry to a worker and when I left I felt better for sharing my feelings. I've also called the Macmillan helpline and had a good chat. And breast cancer care also have a helpline. Xxx",

It then grew back much stronger and three months on I have a cute crop - same colour and texture as before. I bought a wig from the local wig bank for a tenner. i saw it as just another item I could wear on my head and wore it when I felt like having hair and it wasn't too hot. My favourite look is my trilby hats, straw one for summer, tweed one now it is colder. I always get complimented when I wear them. In the house I wore sleep hats if colld or just didn't bother if hot. I know my family preferred me in a wig as it looked more like the 'normal' me but they got used to the bald me!",

I have no swelling, in fact my other arm looks worse from all the veins that collapsed sticking canulas in.

      "Content": "Hi Sascha I hear what you are saying that talking won't change your body. It won't. And people will definitely try to cheer you up by saying about those lovely new boobs you will eventually have but I often think 'well if it is so good why don't you try it?!' I cannot tell you what to do, only what has helped me. I am going to say it again but i found that having someone really listen to what I was saying, not judge or laugh at me and just be kind really helped. I had an immediate reconstruction, it no way looks like my old boob and is really a 'work in progress' but I have come to terms with it by talking about it. My friends hate seeing me upset so I am not so honest with them, but with people I don't know And won't try to cheer me up I have been far more open. If you cannot meet someone face to face maybe try calling Macmillan or Breast Cancer Care. You can also do an email to Breast Cancer Care as part of their 'ask the nurse' and they will get back to you so that won't cost anything. You can also join an on-line chat room via Maggie's Centre - I have chatted there a few times and the people are lovely. It is moderated by a clinical psychologist. They also have a lovely website that makes me cry because it is so caring and I want to go visit but can't! What I learned from mindfulness was to acknowledge the feelings as feelings and not try to get rid of them, just acknowledge Anger, loss, why me, life isn't worth living etc. A book I often turn to is by Pema Chodron- called 'when things fall apart'. That sums up having cancer but it is actually about life in general and how we cope with the tough times. You are having a very very tough time, anyone would feel as you do and it is good to say how you are feeling. I am sending you a virtual hug.",

It sounds as though there are no quick fixes for you, you recognise it is going to be a long process but that doesn't stop you from wanting something now. I think that is a normal response. My only advice is to find someone you can talk to about these feelings, honestly and openly. I used to see a nurse from the oncology health centre and I think my time with her has kept me sane. I also called the Macmillan support line and the breast cancer care nurse to talk over options for treatment. They couldn't tell me what to do or take away the fact that I was being treated for cancer but they helped me by listening. My biggest fear has been losing my identity to cancer and I hear the same concern in your post. Good to talk about here but where have all the magic wands gone?!",

My first re growth was very poor quality so i shaved it off and started again. It pained me but was worth it cos then the second growth was much stronger and like my old hair. Re worries, i work with children and we often talk about worries and how once they start they can get out of control. Fear of the future is my big worry now as well. here's what i tell children - i am sometimes able to do this myself but not consistently. We put worries into a few categories to sort them out: things that will never happen - acknowledge them and throw them away; things that you or someone else can do something' about- get a plan to sort it out; things that have happened and you cannot change - acknowledge them and throw them away; things that may happen but no one can predict - acknowledge and throw away. the main thing is to address the worries and sort them out - that is why journals are so good because it gets it off your mind. I just wish I could do this all the time, i find it so much easier to give advice than act on it!",

      "Content": "Hi Sheila It is a very difficult situation to be in and it is normal to feel so frightened. I was diagnosed with grade two cancer in January and had to wait over Christmas for the results - in that holiday I planned my funeral down to the songs and coffin. However after a mastectomy, reconstruction, chemo and rads I am still here and I realise now that I had to face the fear of death head on and acknowledge I was scared. What kept me going was being mindful - being in the here and now rather than thinking about the future. It was tough but the hospital gave me a relaxation cd which really helped. As for the chemo, it is definitely your decision but I would go for the PICC line if they are offering it. I thought I was fine with needles and did have good veins. 6 chemos later and a host of blood tests in the same arm and my veins were in a terrible state. A friend who had the same treatment had the same reaction. I was offered the PICC line eventually but I only had two further treatments. I think the PICC line is quite a long procedure and someone I met turned it down because she didn't want a line in her constantly. it is your choice. As for chemo side effects, I think everyone is different. I remember trying to plan in advance based on what I had read from others but nothing really prepared me for how I was going to be. I survived on ginger chews and ginger biscuits to keep the nausea at bay and just ate whatever I could. The anti sickness drugs from the hospital meant I was never sick. The rads were fine, just tiring going back and forwards to the hospital. Skin is fine - you get cream to use. My biggest regret with my treatment is that I tried to keep going instead of resting and ended up with fatigue. So really listen to your body and take all the rest you need. if people offer to help then take them up on it! do nice things when you are feeling well and keep doing some exercise, someone I know who had been though it said that even on the days when you feel your worst a short walk will make you feel a bit better. And all the studies show that gentle regular exercise helps. And from my experience they are right Good luck Sheila.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Bella I had the same surgery Feb this year, I was 40 and like you fit and healthy and determined to recover well. I was worried about losing strength and movement but visited a friend who had had an elective bi mastectomy with ld reconstruction. I was amazed how much she could do three months on and she had had both sides done! She was working in a shop again, lifting and carrying fine. Just couldn't quite reach the top shelves. After the op I had four drains and a catheter so for the first day of recovery I was confined to my bed or the chair next to it. I nagged about the catheter and they took it out that night so I could move around. Second day of recovery I had a shower and washed my hair, all one handed. Needed help putting on the bra and socks but otherwise did it myself. The following day I had two drains removed and left hospital with two still in place. Stayed at home over the weekend and then returned to have drains removed. So in all I spent three nights in hospital. Woman opposite me stayed in longer but she didn't move around as much and I think she actually wanted a break from the kids. Sleeping its a bit tricky, I had a shaped pillow to prop myself up and pillows to rest my affected arm on. When the drains came out I could sleep laid straight. You get physio exercises to do and it is amazing the progress you make. I now hardly think about the recon, I had my lymph nodes removed so shouldn't over use it but have got used to using left hand. I think being mobile really helps, I used to do more than the physio said because I used to go to yoga and know how far I can push myself. Re pain, I was on a morphine clicker thing straight after surgery, works a treat on the pain but I was very sick and had it removed quickly. Then I had ibuprofen and paracetamol every four hours and gradually reduced it over time. The main thing I hated was the drains digging in and the dressings pulling on my skin. I had the dressings off after a couple of weeks and used to rub bio oil into the scars. I am going to have liposcupture next year as the recon is not as big as my other boob, i may even have a lift on the other side, i want them looking good after all this effort! Anyway, hope that puts your mind to rest? (Sorry no paras on this iPad)",

It sounds as though it is a preventative measure, they won't be giving it to treat your tumour because that has already been removed successfully. But as Ladybird said it will be to kill any rogue cells in your bloodstream. You may decide that you actually don't want to have chemo as the chances of having infected cells are so small. Just because the oncologist has offered it your really don't have to take it and som women don't. I had chemo to mop up any rogue cells, I really thought about it and whether it was right for me before agreeing. For some independent advice you could always ring the nurses on the Macmillan site or the Breast Cancer Care site. Good luck with making a decision x",

Today went to a personal training assessment. Trainer was impressed with the strength in my upper body, think it must be because I was fit before the op and my back has compensated. I will be having lip sculpturing next year, see the surgeon in February. I haven't really looked into it but one of the radiologists told me she had had it to fill in a leg injury. Apparently the site where they take the fat is painful afterwards. I didn't have spasms or cording. No harm in contacting the physio and getting an assessment done, I take all the help I can. If you are on Facebook Eesibo there is a lovely group for younger women - search for Younger Breast Cancer Network (UK) and ask to join. There are women on there who talk openly about what is happening to them and there is always someone who helps. It is completely closed as well so no outsiders can see your posts. There are people talking about having seromas drained at the moment. Good luck with your recovery, sounds like you are doing really well. Keeping active is the key to post op recovery!",

Anyway I started in sept. had flushes just before from the chemo but actually these stopped on tamoxifen because my periods started again. I have had dry eyes so I have gone back to Wockhart brand as this is the brand that people have mentioned that doesn't have the fillers. I haven't had weight gain - maybe because I am not menopausal and have been watching what I eat and exercising. I have had some fatigue but this has also got better and I think was linked more to chemo and rads. I have ovary pain from when I ovulate but this seems to be less since being on Wockhart.

Write them down and take them with you - I have a notepad that I write something down in as soon as I think of it. that way it doesn't pray on my mind so much. After my mastectomy I had body scans to check that the cancer had not spread to my organs or bones. Luckily it hadn't. I then had chemo and radiotherapy 'just in case' there were rogue cancer cells.  No one has given me an 'all clear'. I have finished my treatment and am taking tamoxifen for 5 years. They removed the cancer in the breast and so the surgery was successful at treating that cancer. The concern I have and I think most people have is that the cancer will return, whether to the mastectomy site, the other breast or as secondaries. And unfortunately no doctor I have met has a crystal ball and can see into the future. Hope tomorrow's appointment goes ok and you get the answers you need.",

      "Content": "I too am interested in this, there was quite a lot of media coverage on DCIS recently and the pros and cons of mammograms. It is difficult to know what to do. I have had breast cancer in one breast, had a mx so won't be screened on that side. But my chances of developing cancer in the other breast are higher than the general population so I will be offered annual mammograms. I have decided to take them because of my age, 40 when diagnosed and If they find anything I will then decided what treatment to have, if any, depending on what they find. For me the issue is of over treatment, rather than over detection. Instead of automatically offering invasive procedures and maybe chemo or rads, medics should really assess with the patient whether it is likely to develop into cancer. My 70 year old auntie had a lumpectomy recently for DCIS, she truly believes she had cancer and would never have challenged the medic who offered the lumpectomy, she thinks he saved her life.",

      "Content": "Hi Kelly, sounds as though you are very anxious at the moment and as everyone has said this is a very normal reaction to your diagnosis and the sad news that your day's cancer has spread. You also have a family you love and want to see grow up. I have just been reading an old book about people with cancer and the writer says that it is so much better to get difficult emotions out rather than bottle them up - his patients who did this tackled their cancer more effectively. So you are doing exactly the right thing by writing about your thoughts here and going to see the counsellor - talking won't cure cancer but it does help you get things in order in your mind. Have you tried writing a journal? Every time an anxious thought or worry pops in your mind write it down. When I was diagnosed I bought a nice notebook and wrote in it constantly, often sobbing. Gradually I haven't needed to write in it as much but when I go through periods of worry I start writing. The more you write worries down the more you see patterns. Some worries are based on what has happened already and cannot be changed - yours and your dad's cancer. These are worries that need to be acknowledged but ultimately let go of because you cannot change it. Some of your worries are based on what might happen - it will spread around my body. These worries you can address - as people have said you can ask for a scan and find. Something else that helped me was doing daily relaxation, the hospital gave me a cd. Again I would sometimes sob as I started to do it but gradually it calmed down my mind. My dad talks about the monkeys in our mind that love to create confusion, relaxation and meditation shuts those monkeys up for a while! Good luck xxxxx",

Have you thought about seeing someone from your university student services? All universities have access to counsellors who you can talk to about anything that is worrying you. Just ask a tutor and they will able to point you in the right direction or the student union will do. Have you told a tutor what you are going through? They are also there to help. My friend is a lecturer and is always pleased when students tell her what is happening at home because it can have a real effect on your studies. Anyway, I bet you are home now and helping your mum.

I had my dose reduced by 20% and was much better for the last two doses, no hospital thank goodness, so fingers crossed your mum will be the same and manage the last couple better. The t chemo does make you emotional, most women say that emotionally it is tougher, it gets you down somehow. Also you get gradually more tired as the treatment progresses and this makes you emotional. There wasn't anything anyone could say to console me sometimes, I would just sob! It is definitely a chemical thing because when the chemo ended the sobbing stopped - thank goodness! Hope that has put your mind at rest a little, you sound like a very caring daughter. You can always call the Macmillan helpline if things continue to worry you, the workers are lovely, I called a couple of times and found it very helpful. And if you are struggling to sleep there are herbal tablets you can take to help relax you, frm boots or holland and Barrett. Something that also helps is writing down your thoughts, all your worries. Do it very day as soon as worries pop in your head, then your mind is clearer and you can sleep better. Good luck and well done for helping your mum so well, it is not easy seeing someone you love have such a rubbish time xxxx",

      "Content": "It definitely helps to post here, there are a lot of wise owls on this site. I had my mastectomy and a reconstruction at the same time before chemotherapy and i found that the surgery was definitely easier than the chemo. Radiotherapy is fine, time consuming and tiring but it is the easiest of the treatments, I am now on the five years of tablets - I take tamoxifen. And that has been ok for me too, I did get a bit bogged down with worrying about taking tablets because I never go to drs! But actually it has been fine. So I was diagnosed beginning of January this year and I am definitely getting back to normal. I still get tired if I do too much but I feel so much better than when I was in the middle of chemo and I know your mum will too. Breast cancer is so treatable now, compared to even twenty years ago the outcomes are miles better. It is a very scary thing to have and I certainly felt that I was going to die when I was diagnosed because i knew nothing about it. Not the case! You will have been reading stories and information on here and seen how successful treatment is, the other good site is Breast Cancer Care. Everyone will say it but try not to google breast cancer, it really scares you! Stick to this site and BCC and you will get the best information. Xx",

I posted the other day and someone suggested keeping hydrated, simple but so important. Since then I have recovered a bit and am trying to help myself. Macmillan have a very good leaflet 'coping with fatigue' with lots of ideas that make a lot of sense. Fatigue is a very personal thing, can last weeks, months or years. I saw a fatigue nurse during chemo, the main thing I learned was to use my energy more wisely. Keeping a fatigue diary - there is one in the mac leaflet- helped me to track what I was doing with my energy. The nurse used to say that our body energy is like a mobile phone battery and at the moment our battery is only partially charged. So we can use that energy making little texts or use it all up in one go with a long phone call. I have made a lot of phone calls recently, i thought my treatment had finished and i was fine hence I crashed last week. But I am going back to texts for a while to get myself sorted for Christmas. I hate being like this, like you I normally have energy on tap and like you love socialising, last week I couldn't think straight I was so tired. I think Xmas dos are fine, just save your battery before and allow enough time to recover afterwards. Note to myself- practice what you preach Nicola! Ps gp has just tested my blood, she wonders if I am iron deficient from the treatment. Makes sense.",
