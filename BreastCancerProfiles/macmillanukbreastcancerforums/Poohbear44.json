      "Content": "Hi all, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April, have gone thru 6 sessions of chemo, had surgery, now having radium and continuing with my Herceptin injections. What a year??  I finally picked up my prescription for Tamoxifen today and reading comments that ladies have put on so much weight in another forum, I'm so reluctant to take them. I'm overweight already so putting on more weight is really daunting.  My hair is only now beginning to grow back (well looks like bum fluff really) and read that Tamoxifen can stop hair growth so if that's the case how long will it take before my hair grows back.  Why can't they make a tablet that will prevent the cancer from returning by be kind to you after going thru so much already. Can anyone help with a diet plan that has helped them realising that everyone is different so what works for you might not work for me. Thanks all",
