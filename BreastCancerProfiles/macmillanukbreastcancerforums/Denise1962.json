      "Content": "Hi. I had a small tumour removed last year from my breast, 15 sessions of radiotherapy and am now taking anastrazole. About 3 months after treatment I had my hair lightened. While rinsing, a lot of hair came out! My hair was definitely thinner and more brittle after taking the anastrazole, although it isn't as bad now. I have only had it lightened twice since then using very mild products and it was ok but not as light as I usually go. My hairdresser has said if I can find a 'safe' amount of peroxide to use, she'll try. Does anyone have any recommendations? Small fry I know, but it's all about getting confidence back! ",
