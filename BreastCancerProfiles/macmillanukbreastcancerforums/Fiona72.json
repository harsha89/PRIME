      "Content": "Ihave been diagnosed with lobular breast cancer. I'm to get a mastectomy on my left breast and removal of the lymph nodes. My doctor has told me he will not consider a double mastectomy, even though the risks are high in developing cancer on the right side. He had also told me that I will not be co sidered for reconstructive surgery because of  my BMI is too high. I'm feeling pretty bad about myself at the moment. And wonder if this is just standard practice. Has anyone been faced with the same situation ? Can I challenge his decision?  ",
