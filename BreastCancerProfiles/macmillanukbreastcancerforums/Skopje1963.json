      "Content": " initally when I was diagnosed back in April I also experienced similar problems..I felt I'm pulling the strings on my own...by calling and asking about my appointments...Once I had BC nurse allocated,I  had her mobile number and email to get in touch when ever I need it.She was always able to change my  appointments(if needed) especially follow ups,scans and blood tests and also arranging some of them in one day so I don't have to travel to the hospital several times per week.But again maybe I was lucky with my nurse.I would advice you to call again on Monday to find out the date..Keep calling to remind them.. How ever there is National Guaidance for starting the treatment once you are diagnosed with cancer..I think it was 60 days...and they have to follow this... Have a look on the internet... Hope this helps.  Good luck. X Ani",
