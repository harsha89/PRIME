      "Content": "It's 17 years since I had my original triple negative breast cancer. It looks likely that I have a tumour on my pituitary gland as my prolactin hormone level is extremely high. (2000 + when it should be max 29) These tumours are normally benign but because of my history I was thinking the brain is one area breast cancer likes for metastases! A very low percentage, less than 1% I think, of these pituitary tumours are metastatic breast cancer so it is very unlikely but not completely impossible. Having been triple negative it is unlikely I'd get metastases now but also not impossible. I suppose I am worrying as I was a \"radiotherapy failure\" - 5% of people - meaning I had a recurrance of the BC. I also have a habit of being in like the 1% - like the one who gets it, whatever it is, when most people don't, whatever it is. Does anyone know anything about this topic? When BC spreads to the brain are there common areas it tends to go or is it totally variable?",
