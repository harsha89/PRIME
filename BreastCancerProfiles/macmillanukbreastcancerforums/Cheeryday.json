      "Content": "Hi, thank you for this post. I am due to have a right mastectomy in the next few weeks. I do not want reconstruction surgery, it is so involved and as I am a DD I would need reduction in my left breast anyway! When I have mentioned going flat to my surgeon he has ignored me and just mentioned I may want reconstruction further down the line. Once healed I will pursue having the other breast removed if I still want it. I'm sure I will just want to be balanced. ",
