Regarding cancer info....plenty of experts here All with great sound, no nonsense advice. Thanks for your help re the calcium.  Don't think she would be ready to join this group and hope she never has to!  Hope all is going well for you now.",

      "Content": "I do feel that until you or someone you know go through the whole cancer experience you have NO idea of what it's all about.  Until my husband was diagnosed with cancer I just assumed that it was just like every other medical procedure. Surgery, recovery, bit of chemo.....job done. He now has secondaries in his liver....  The relentlessness of hospital appointments, chemo sessions, scans, worry, anxiety, always hoping for the best but expecting the worse.  People don't realise how serious secondary cancers are.  We too hate the Macmillan adverts. it possibly has less impact on those not going through it than those who are. We really don't want to be shown, reminded of the awfulness of it all or what we will be facing. Cancer seems to crop up unexpectantly on all sorts of TV programs. We turn them off immediately. We're living with all the crap and want it thrust in our faces while trying to escape it by watching our TV programs. I'm pleased to hear from you Bonbon! You and a few others were the ones I always looked out for when I first joined this community and was wondering how you were. MrsCJ?",
