      "Content": "Hi, I have recently had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy.  The results were positive, the tumour was very small and had been removed with a good margin and the four nodes tested were clear.  When I first received my diagnosis I was told that chemotherapy would probably be recommended along with herceptin as my cancer was ER+ and HER2+, which I was able to come to terms with.  However I met with the oncologist this week who went through the survival stats on their Predict computer programme.   The stats suggested that with my pathology results I should have a 96% survival rate over 5yrs and 92% over 10yrs if I do not have chemo, if I chose to have chemo then this only increased by a further 2%.  He also added that because of my aged I was at a higher risk of the breast cancer returning.  I was sent away to consider my treatment options, just have the radiotherapy and hormone therapy, or go for the full treatment chemo/herceptin/radiotherapy/hormone therapy.   I now need to make the decision of what to do next and I don't have a clue where to start.  I am 37 yrs old with three children aged 10, 7 & 2.  With such high survival rates without chemo do I really want to put myself through the treatment for such a small percentage increase, or do I have the chemo in the knowledge that I have done all I can to preserve my health for the sake of my children.  Having lost my Mum suddenly when I was 26 I do not want to put them through the pain I felt when it happened. I know logically that I have been very lucky in that the tumour has been removed and it had not spread to the lymph nodes and therefore chemo shouldn't be necessary.  However I'm worried that I only found the lump by accident and what I actually found was a tiny cyst which happened to be attached to the tumour.  If my body has done this to me now what else could it do and is there anything else elsewhere??  I have had five family members with different cancers, one of which was ovarian.  If I had the chemo at least I would know that if there was anything else hiding in me then it would be cleared out, then if anything else developed in the future it would be a new growth and not something that had been festering from now. I thought that by having the stats results it would help me make a decision and know what is to happen next, but all they have done is confuse me even more.  I had had my head around having chemo from the start but now I feel that what I thought was going to happen has been turned upside down. So I am left with the question - Is the extra 2% and the peace of mind worth the unpleasantness of chemo???   Sarah x",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for you messages of support, I really appreciate it. My tumour was only 5mm and stage 2 and although the treatment seems a bit 'sledgehammer & walnut' I think the peace of mind will be worth it.  FECing treatment here we come ! I only found my lump by accident. I had got a biscuit crumb down my bra and when I brushed it away I felt something.  So the morale of my story is don't let anyone tell you that eating biscuits is bad for you!!",
