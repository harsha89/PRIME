      "Content": "Dear flower and joanne, thank you both for replying to me. i know that my lump is 2cm and i was also told it was idc. they must do it differently depending on where you live then, i am also in scotland. i got the biopsy first and 6 days later which was this week, wednesday i was told  that i did have cancer then on thursday I got a mammogram, bone scan, chest x ray and bloods.  i was told yesterday that all these came back looking fine and it is only the 3 lymp nodes that are prominent, so i understand now from what you are saying that they will need to wait till the lymp nodes are out and take a look at them before they know for definate. its such a difficult thing to take in but i really do think that i can fight this, it will not get the better of me. its good to know that there are people out there who know what i am going through but also sad to think this happens to so many, but we just need to keep strong and positive and fight this. sending hugs and positive thoughts to you both x x        ",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm a 33 year old woman who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer.  i found a lump and went to the doctor 3 times and got told i had an infection but i was also referred to the breast clinic and they did a fine needle biospy and core biopsy and results just came back that i do indeed have cancer. this week i have had an ultrasound, mammogram, bone scan, chest xray, bloods taken and i have been told that they all look ok but my ultrasound was showing 3 prominent lymph nodes when i had the ultrasound. can anyone give me some advice?  i do have my next appointment on wednesday (4 days time) to talk to the consultant but this is constanty on my mind, i am trying to relax and think positive.  i am trying to think about 7, 8 months down the road and this will all be over but its still hard. when i talk to the consultant on wednesday will he be able to tell me the stage i am at and when i am going to be operated on?  do they have to remove the lymph nodes before they know what stage?  if my lymph nodes are prominent does this mean that cancer has spread? i am so confused!  still a bit numb but trying to find out as much as possible,   thanks for reading xx",
