      "Content": "Hi Jean, I also had a lumpectomy & SN & after 2 weeks I had the same sensitive, painful & swollen breast. I returned to hospital where the surgeon saw me immediatly & she had to cut open the scar ( not painful at all ) & pushed out lots of lumpy blood which had collected which was causing the problem. I had to have the district nurse in every day after to clean it out & dress it - 3 weeks on the wound has closed but the nurse is still coming in every day to change the dressing to make sure I dont get an infection as I have to have a mastectomy on Friday. I know this is probably not the news you want to hear with your upcoming holiday but please get it checked out before you go & ask your surgeons advice. I also saw my GP( who didnt do much) before going back to my surgeon & she(my surgeon) told me I should have gone straight back to see her & not gone to my GP seeing as it was her that operated.  I know your holiday is much needed but complications in another country may be far more stressful. Sorry to be gloom & doom & I hope all goes well for you. ",

Any questions you have to ask there is always someone who will answer you. Its a scarey time - theres no getting away from that - but you will be surprised at how strong you will become. Losing a breast is an awful thing to come to terms with BUT its a small price to pay for being able to continue with your life cancer free. take care & good luck xx Lorna - can I ask you more info on your reconstruction please.

      "Content": "Hiya - I like you couldnt contimplate the cold cap & just went with it.  So by my experience the only hair on ALL my body I didnt lose was the hairs on my forearms. Why they stayed I havent a clue ??!! I finished my chemo on 28th March & had 25 sessions of rads which finished 2 weeks ago. To give you a bit of encouragement as I know the thought of losing my hair was just too awful - I actually took the bull by the horns on Thursday last & went to the bakery, local co-op & bank without my wig for the 1st time -- yesterday I went for a meal with a friend to the chinese & last night to the local bar - both wigless. My hair isnt really long at all but saying that growing back quicker than I thought & covers my scalp - I have been wearing wig since Jan 2nd. When I started losing my eyebrows I went to a \"posh shop\" that sold make-up & explained to the girl that I wanted an eyebrow pencil. She was really helpful & as I still had a few eyebrows left she matched the colour well & showed me how to put it on without it looking false & screaming \"cancer\" Dont know if this helps or is too much info ? Take care & anymore questions just ask; xx",

Not a tear in sight thankfully.   None of us going through this nightmare can expect to sail through it emotionally - go & talk to your GP & if he/she prescribes anti depressants then take them - it wont be forever & sometimesz we need something just to help us get through the \"bad\" times ( its all bad but there are bad & bad arnt there ?)   I hope this has helped a bit.

He comes down & sees me when he feels like it - has boosted my moods loads of times with his off the wall sense of humour but when I have been at my darkest he stays away - just at the times when I've really needed him. I have had to try to be upbeat when I least feel like it as I know he wont come down if he knows Im on a downer. Typical man really - cant change things so doesnt know how to deal with it so distances himself. He has at times been there & held me in the night when I havent been able to stop crying but not as often as I would have liked. So I know what its like to lie there in the dark alone & frightened with your thoughts - its always worse at nights isnt it. I have tried to read, watched all sorts of rubbish on TV - anything to distract my thoughts.  Saying that I couldnt have got through this without him despite his faults & I am lucky enough to have my  14 yr old son with me who I've had to be strong for & my 18 yr old son who phones me often as he has lived abroad since Feb. Keep positive & in control of more than the remote. We are all strong whatever circumstances we find ourselves in - we owe it to ourselves & our future to stay positive. take care & remember theres always someone here who you can have a chat or rant to. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, You must be feeling pretty low with the lack of interest from your partner. Men are wierdos sometimes & dont know how to cope with things they cant change. I am lucky enough to have a partner ( only been together for just over a year when I was diagnosed ) who supports me but at times  I know he finds it very hard without him telling me this. We dont live together & sometimes when he phones me & its a \"bad day\" & I am upset  he just cuts the conversation short & says he'll ring off & phone next day - that really hurts as all I want is for him to come down & give me a cuddle & I know I would be OK again but that just doesnt happen. For all his support he just cant cope with the \"upset \" me & although he says he's fine with my hair loss I know it makes him uncomfortable & so I make sure I keep some sort of covering on when he's around but have told him I cant sleep in it but he's doesnt look at me much when Im in my bald state which is not normally how he is.   You will be feeling so vulnerable at the moment that any coldness from him will be magnified. Perhaps he doesnt feel able to look at the book you had done for him just yet as it only confirms what you will be losing. As well as being strong for ourselves we find ourselves in the situation of having to be strong for all those closest to us as well which is really hard at times. You dont say how long its been since your diagnosis ? Its maybe not so much he's in denial but just feels so helpless & doesnt know how to react so you really have to sit him down & talk to him about it & how you feel. He may not be able to express how he feels in words - as mine cant- but actions mean so much more sometimes,n a big hug cant do wonders most of the time. Tell him how you feel & how much you need his support, you never know , once you force him to talk about it things may (hopefully) get better. Men are basically selfish creatures & need things pointing out to them. Good luck with your op - this site is great for words of encouragement & advice. Take care. xx",

Easier said than done I know ??!!   I know he loves me to bits & worries but sometimes we just have to accept the fact they are like they are as expressing their feelings with words its difficult with the majority of them - its an alien concept & distance/coldness is their way of coping. Dont forget men dont want to be thought of as the weaker sex - but in many ways they are - especially emotionally.   Good job for this site & the support we are able to give each other xx",

      "Content": "Hi Trish, Thanks for finding me again - I had mistakenly deleated this thread & couldnt find it myself. So - update. Sorry to hear about your hospital episode but maybe this will give you - & anyone else reading this - a bit of encouragement. I saw my onc & he said that he wouldnt reduce my dose & basically I would have to put up with the S/E's. When I then proceded in to have my dose of poison thats going to save my life the nurse who came to administer it asked me how I got on with the anti-sickness they infused into me before the Tax. I told her than the last 2 times it gave me panic attack - very not me - & hot flushes while it was being infused. She asked if I had any nausea after the 1st Tax - which I hadnt at all so she decided to not give me the anti sickness infusion & just the Tax. It all went great - no panic or anything so she's put on my file to leave it out for my next  one- which is my last YIPPEEEE !!!!! I had to have injection next day - as in last one - for neutrophenia. I had to order it from chemist & couldnt be bothered to get up early to collect it as I had done for the first so made an app. for the nurse to come & give it to me at 5pm. The previous one she came at 9am. Well - after that I waited & waited for the S/E's to kick in, as in awful horrendous bone pain. I am 9 days on & still waiting !! I had the chemo on the weds & it kicked in really bad on the mon night. 1st time. I have had nothing, nada, nowt, zilch, rien !!!!  Well the plot thickens - or does it ?? I happened to look at the leaflet for S/E's that comes with the injection - which cost 1,370 euros by the way !! For one injection !! Thats the beauty of here in France & having to go to chemist to get all meds. Sorry - got side tracked -- bone pain was marked for 1 in 10 people & clearly marked in dark bold print -- \" Only to be administered 24 hours or more AFTER last chemo\" Well this time due to my laziness I had it 28 hrs after my chemo !! Was that the reason I didnt get the pain ?? They wouldnt have put that in the notice just to fill up space. AND if this is the case WHY OH WHY didnt they tell me at the hospital ? I will definatly mention it when I go for my next one & obviously have the next injection, which they have already told me I will need, in the late afternoon & sit back & hope. I have corned beef, flaky, snakey hands back again & my feet are peeling round my toes but all do-able - oh & cardboard mouth which is now slowly going. I feel the best I've felt for months & hope this will give others a boost to think that despite all the horrors some people have with Tax - we are all different & it affects us all differently. How do you feel now ? Let me know wont you. Take care xx",

I have kept them religiously hidden from the light with black nail varnish since starting with the Taxso hope its enough - cant bear the thought of loosing yet something else. I also took tramadol this time which seemed to help. Hi Susan, Glad I was able to give you some positive thoughts. I also had 3 FEC before Tax & was worried about it. I had awful nausea with Fec but no actual sickness & was really tired - more than with the Tax. Christmas day I slept 18 hrs out of 24 !! Awful then but distant memory now!! I've had a port from the start & had no probs with it & forget its there usually. Good luck with the Tax & hope you are OK for the skiing. Take painkillers as a precaution, as I did. I was prescribed Tramadol. I have lived in France for 17 yrs & I can assure you the hospitals/ health care is excellent - not that you will need it hopefully. They leave nothing to chance here. Let me know how you're doing. Take care xx",

I have my next one on 7th March & know it makes sense to phone before to find out if they will add another session but I think I will stay in splendid ignorance seeing as its only next week - I have it in my head that the 28th March is my last one & will be gutted if it isnt so think for me a week of ignorance will be better. I dont know how they do things at my unit as everywhere seems different reading other peoples experiences. Hope you manage to get needed rest - I rest when feeling iffy but make sure the days I feel \"normal\" I make the most of them. Mind you \"normal\" sometimes seems a million years ago doesnt it ? When I eventually get my hair back I will NEVER complain about a bad hair day again.  I still have eyelashes & eyebrows - getting a bit sparse but still hanging on in there. I am about to remove & replace my nail varnish - dont know what to expect when I take it off but it will be as it is I guess - no good stressing about it.   The cortisone cream the doc gave me for my hands today seems to have calmed it somewhat which is good.

Spent the weekend trying desperately trying not to scratch but its driven me mad & now my knuckles are slightly swollen. Went to my GP this morning & she phoned the oncology unit who said it was an allergic reaction to the Tax. They said that my next -& penultimate one - they will reduce the dose else the reaction could be worse next time. I immediately went into paranoid, panic mode -- reduced dose yelled to me reduced effectiveness. My GP assured me this is not so but if a reduced dose works just as well  then in my mind why do they give it to you at a higher dose in the first place. Am I being stupid to think like this - I just dont know anymore as all my logic seems to have left me lately.   Hope you are both doing OK - keep in touch to let me know. xx",

Sunday was again do-able with Monday getting worse & last night I cried like a baby with the pain & ended up on the sofa with the TV on all night as a possible distraction - didnt work. At the hospital they told me that paracetamol would be enough for the pain - masochists !! I phoned my GP today & she has put me on Tramadol but reckons that I may have had double pain as I had to have an injection on Thurs as my white cell count was down & that can give you extra pains.   Like you I am apprehensive about my further two sessions to come but its got to be done.   A nurse friend of mine has told me to try & eat lots of protein.   Let me know how its going xx  ",

Nenz - As you can see I have now finished my 3rd & final Tax after 3 Fec. After my 1st Tax I felt awful with the bone pain on the monday ( had it on the weds ) & it lasted about 2 days in all. Im sorry to hear you are still getting pain after so long.  I was prescribed Tramadol which helped almost immediatly to relive the pain. On the 2nd & 3rd I started taking it on the Sat morning as a preventive & it kept away all the pain on the 2nd & Im hoping it will for this 3rd & final. Did you have to have an injection for white blood cells the day after ? I did & after I had it saw in the notes with the jab that you have to wait 24hrs after the Tax before having it as it gives joint/bone pain also. I reckon thats why I had such awful pain as it was a double dose if you like. The 2nd one I made sure 24hrs had gone by & I had hardly any pain at all to speak of. I know how you must be feeling about going for your next one - very apprehensive as I was. The thought of that pain again was just too scarey. I dont know if this is of any help to you info wise ? I wish you all the best & hope you can get some pain relief soon. xx",

I kept a chemo diary & wrote down anything I thought relevant i.e how I was feeling & any S/E's on what day after the chemo. I found it very helpful to look back on so knew what maybe to expect on what days & was able to be more prepared. I lived in 3 week cycles between sessions as the thought of looking at the bigger picture to the end was to much to think of - I found that it helped doing that as it passed quicker.

Its always a big thing for us women the \"no hair issue\" & I had a mastectomy 4 weeks ago & my 1st chemo last weds - the thought of loosing my hair very soon is more upsetting to me than the fact I have lost a breast - how irrational is that eh ??Hair will grow back - my boob wont. Anyway if you get yours cut short now then perhaps it wont be so distressing when / if you loose it. I have my wig ready in its box & its so much like my own hair that when I gave it a whirl with my kids my eldest son was talking to me for 10 mins & didnt notice I had it on until I whipped it off ( mind you he is an 18yr old boy !! ) However I will still feel self consious wearing it when the time comes thats for sure.   In the meantime try to have a good christmas before your surgery  Take care x",

      "Content": "Hi Pat,   I too saw people about a lump I found about 12 months before I was diagnosed & was told it was fatty tissue. It was only because it was always a niggle in the back of my mind that I finally - insisted after a negative mammo - that I wanted more tests done. I am a single Mum & felt I owed it to my 2 boys at least. I had lost my Mum to colon cancer in 2004 & my dear sister to womb cancer a year ago. Thought I was paranoid cos of this but an echo proved my fears to be right. I am so angry at times as I could have had treatment a lot earlier than I have had. Got my 3rd chemo this weds after my mx in Nov. Try to stay positive & above all keep your sense of humour where possible as Im sure it helps the healing process. Being down & depressed doesnt change a thing except it makes us feel worse. Take care xx",

Knowing I am on the home straight is just great & nice to be finally  feeling back to relativly normal (whatever \"normal\" is ?!) The marking up is nothing to worry about & doesnt hurt at all where they tattoo you - just 4 pin pricks. I have started rubbing Aloe Vera into the radio site as its supposed to help with the possible \"sunburn\" effect. Cant do any harm anyway. No info on hormone tabs as will be starting on Arimadex but not til after the radio. Good luck - almost at the end now - doesnt it feel great to say that ?. xxx By the way my hair is coming back with visible hairline already - look like a baby eagle !!",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I really feel or you & what your going through. I started off with biopsy, lumpectomy & then ended up having to have a mastectomy mid Nov  2011. It was all so scarey as it happened in the space of 2 months. I felt like I was on a merrygoround that I couldnt get off of. I know how scared you feel, mine was found by chance as well.   I have also been trying to give up smoking for the past 6 months as I have had loads of tests which have all come back negative & to carry on smoking is just CRAZY. Its not as easy as I have found it to give up in the past e.g I gave up for 12 years when I found I was pregnant with my 1st son,( now 18 ), just like that as was scared of the effects it would have on my unborn child. Why oh why I dont manage it now knowing the effects on myself is beyond me. Soooo I know where you are there - I give it up for about 3/4 days then I get a bad few days & start again. Maybe only 3 or 4 a day but all the same .......   Scream if you want, it wont change things but might make you feel better. I miss my sister terribly as she died aged 55 in April 2010. I go outside at night into the garden , pick the brightest star - who is my sis looking down on me - & rant & rave to her. Do what you need to do - dont feel crazy as we all have our ways of coping with our demons. You will cope & get through this as we all will. I have said before but will say again - everyday passed is a day nearer to beating this & being well again.   Take care & PM me if you need a rant xx",

I phoned my GP the next day & she prescribed me Tramadol & they worked wonders. For my next 2 T I took them at day 3 as a precaution & didnt have anything like the pain at all. Also after my 1st T my hands became itchy & on fire - unbearable with the skin peeling off my hands & feet - I also got cream from the docs which calmed it all down.  I was warned about nail loss so wore black nail varnish throughout my T on both nails & toenail - still wearing it 4 weeks after last one. Apparently its light sensitive. I havent had any nail loss at all so it worked for me - couldnt bare the thought of losing anything else. Good luck with the rest of your treatment. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda - you asked at what stage we are at & by your last posting I hope I can give you a bit of a cheer-up. I was diagnosed in sept 2011, had a biopsy in October & a mastectomy in November. The thought of the chemo filled me with horror. I started it in Dec & managed to keep my hair until 3rd Jan when I went to my best mates armed with the clippers & a big bottle of wine. Losing my hair has been more stressful than losing my boob but even that I've got used to now. I have just got a 2nd more \"funky\" wig which everyone loves. I had my last chemo on March 28th & cant believe its finally finished. I lived in 3 week cycles so perhaps thats why it seemed to go quicker than I ever imagined. I did get side effects - but they dont last forever & I am still here to tell the tell & now fighting fit ( Well I will be ) to continue with me life. I have 25 sessions of radio starting on April 23rd so will be finished 31st May. You will get through it as impossible as it seems at the beginning - it seems an impossible mountain to climb but with guts & determination - positive thinking & as much humour as you can muster you will get there a stronger person at the end of it. I was trying to get my waitressing job back but I heard the restaurant is now looking for topless waitresses - my arguement is that they would only have to pay me half wages !!  Take care - you need a rant anytime I will always be willing to listen & give any support / info I can. xxx",

Sometimes it felt that I wanted to curl up in a ball & say \" leave me alone I cant do this - dont want to play this game anymore\" but you just cant do that as that means the gremlins have won. Your husband & your kids will be your reason for being strong - it must be hard for you having 9 kids but thats 9 good reasons for you to stay positive. 10 with your husband. I know exactly what you mean about how you feel about your Mum dying. I felt the same with my boys & my Mum but mostly my sister as they were very close to her & she was only 55 when she died 2 yrs ago ( I'm now 54 ) I dont know the ages of your children but be honest as you can with them - explain to them that breast cancer is a different thing to womb cancer. Thats what I tried to stress to my boys as my sis died of womb cancer. They may not want to start the conversation with you but its important you reassure them by not trying to ignore it. Its a hard conversation to have but nessesary to make then aware of whats going on. You will be suprised at how resiliant they are - I know mine suprised me thats for sure & Im proud of them for it. Take care & keep posting to let me know how you are doing. xx",

However you will find lots of help & support from all the ladies on this site. You will be able to have a rant & rave as there is always someone here to listen & support you with good advice - belive it or not you will even find humour here - hard to believe for you at this early stage I know. I know what you mean about never getting over your Mum - I lost mine to colon cancer in 2004 & my sister to womb cancer 2 years ago tomorrow. I am 54 & just want a cuddle from my Mum & for her to tell me it will be allright. The further on down the road of this nightmare you get you will find it easier & as hard as it is to believe now the light at the end of the long tunnel will burn brighter with each bit of treatment you go through.  I dont know how old your girls are, I have 2 sons of 14 & 18 & I found being honest with then was the best thing I could do to help them cope. Children are more resiliant than we give them credit for no matter what age. Dont forget - if you need a moan you can always contact me or someone on here. Take care & remenber that each day passed is a day nearer recovery. xxx",

I have already got my wig upstairs in its box - those who I have shown it to have said its amazing & so like my own hair & my eldest son was talking to me for 15 mins when I tried it on & didnt realise I had one on til I whipped it off ( mind you he is 18 & they dont notice much at that age unless it concerns them !! ) I take courage in what you have said & when the time comes then perhaps I will be able to shave my head as well. Its crazy as it upsets me more the thought of loosing my hair than the fact I have lost a boob - why is that ?

I took them straight away & the relief was almost instant (almost) & it just eased off after than until I was pain free by the tuesday evening. The next 2 Tax I was dreading so took the Tramadol from the sat morning as a precaution & I can honestly say, 100% hand on heart, I had no pain at all after the next 2 sessions. I wish I had been warned before so knew to take the Tramadol before the 1st bone pains started. I hope this is of some help & you manage to get some relief. Take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Christine, I had a mastectomy on Nov 18th & I still have a pulling on the scar tissue even though it has healed very well. I have a bit of numbness at the back of my arm at armpit level & not a lot of feeling where my boob used to be & down as far as the middle of my ribs at the side. It doesnt bother me too much & I just think its a small price to pay for getting rid of the gremlins. Hope you get on alright & hopefully I will get on like you with the Arimidex. I guess its just them getting & settling into the system. Take care xx",

      "Content": "Hi SC, You are not being shallow or silly having these thoughts about your partner. I was only with mine for a year before I was diagnosed & gave him the option of baling out straight away. Luckily for me he didnt & told me not to be so stupid as I was the same person. I had a lumpectomy & then a mastectomy in Nov last year. I hated undressing in front of him ( we dont live together but he comes & stays a few times a week) & always kept covered up at first as like you i thought he would be repulsed. I finally plucked up courage to ask him if he wanted to see my scar & he said only if I was ready. He was brilliant. The problem is with us & how we see ourselves as women. Our men find it just as difficult but for different reasons. I am now bald due to chemo & he is still at my side supporting me. Give your partner a chance to show you he cares - you've been together for 7 years so dont underestimate him or his feelings for you. Good luck with the radiotherapy xx",
