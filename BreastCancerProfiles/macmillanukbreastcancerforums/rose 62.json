      "Content": "Hi not sure if I am doing this right but wanted to reply to the lady that is debating re implant or ld flap. I have had a mx and reconstruction using ld flap on 27th June this year and have to say it knocked me for six initially, but I am well and truly on the mend now. I struggled for a while with fluid ( seroma ) which led to my back wound not healing up properly but that is all behind me now ( excuse the pun ). I have to say I know I made the right decision, I wont have to keep returning to get pumped up etc and wont need further surgery. The flip side of this is that I now have a new party trick with my breast to amuse friends with, as the muscle can be a little jumpy until you get used to it! Whatever decision you make is difficult but I can say, for me, ld flap was the right way to go. I wish you all the luck with both the op, and your recovery xx",

      "Content": "Hi Angela, Thanks for your reply. Really pleased your MD seems so understanding, wish mine was lol.  I am sure they are fully aware that they are not following the rules but I suspect they think I will just put up or shut up!  I have a solicitor who works closely with Macmillan and she is dealing with it so I will keep you posted. I would have understood if I was asking for major adjustments to my work or weeks of phased return but all I asked for, as I say, was 2 weeks of half days to get me back into the swing of working again. Oh well, onwards and upwards Best wishes to you too xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie, Had to reply as can totally empathise with you on this one. I was diagnosed in May this year and spoke to my HR dept as policy says they dont pay full sick pay unless you have worked for them for 3 years, I had done 5 months.  HR kindly told me there were no exceptions to this rule and although they were very sorry for me there was nothing they could do. They also said if I needed a couplke of days to get my head round my diagnoses ( a couple of days???? ) they would give me 2 days emergency leave, but if I chose not to take them then I am saying I am fit for work and therefiore I would be expected to do my job properly. I work as nurse lead in a large nursing home. Anyway, time passed I have been off sick for 4 months following mastectomy, reconstruction and wound problems, and my GP has now said although I am medically fit for work, he would advise I return half days only for the first two weeks to break me in gently so to speak. I had a meeting with my employer and raised this but was told categorically no! I was also told I am expected to return and hit the floor running, as I have one month of my probation to go, and basically if I dont prove myself in that time I will be dismissed. Alternatively, they advised I may like to resign in which case they would give me some extra salary and a good reference!!! After a lot of soul searching I decided I could not work for a Company that treated me like this and tendered my resignation, then spoke to a solicitor. So in conclusion, Jackie, I have great sympathy for you. I am lucky in that I have got possible prospects coming up but if nothing materialises then I will be in the same predicament without a wage coming in.  I am lucky I have a husband who works but we have always had two wages so obviously things will be difficult. I just think it is hard enough to be diagnosed with this bloody disease without having extra worries added at an already very worrying, scary time. All the best Jackie, I hope things work out for you Rose xx",
