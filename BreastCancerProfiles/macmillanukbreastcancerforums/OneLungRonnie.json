    "Content": "Hi Vic, Before I comment, you can get advice through Macmillan and C.A.B on these matters who will be better informed. The freephone number below is a point for first contact. That said my understanding would be that it depends on your working circumstance and the type of employment you had before needing time off due to illness. Your employment rights are determined by your type of employment, which would be different if you were full time employed or self employed for example. If I were to assume that you were a full time employee with contracted hours, particularly if long term, then you have statutory rights that include time off and circumstance relating specifically to cancer. I'm not sure of any details but I'm fairly certain your employer cannot alter the terms of your contractual arrangements and any understanding regarding contracted hours. If you are considered fit to return to work by clinicians your employer is obliged to accept that. I think they have obligations to meet, as you will also, that relate to matters of welfare and health and safety but not the right to dictate any terms of reinstating the contract as you seem to suggest. Mutual consent for change is probably something that occurs regularly and I imagine that both responsible employers and employees will try their best to accommodate each other for a safe and manageable return to work.  Please don't take my comments as the letter of law, it's best to check and I would try the freephone number first Vic and ask some basic questions of the benefits advisor.  All the best.",
