      "Content": "Hi thank you for your reply. It has no lump- it is the other breast with the benign lump. The breast with the rash is so painful though. The doctor I saw today at my GP practice said if there is no lump he\u2019s not worried. But after reading about IBC there doesn\u2019t have to be a lump. I get seen privately on Tuesday to try and get some answers and I\u2019m so scared  this baby is so longed for and I keep getting health scares/problems! I also have lumps in my mouth and see an oral surgeon next week.cant cope with all the worry ",

      "Content": "to cut a long story short... I\u2019m 29.  last August I was sent to the breast clinic due to right sided breast pain that had been happening for around 6-8 months. It was in one area, in the lower quadrant.  The first thing they did was an ultrasound. They scanned both breasts. They asked me did I know about a lump in the left side? Which I didn\u2019t.  I saw the consultant. He didn\u2019t mention the right painful breast as he was concerned about this lump in the left side. They brought me back a few hours later for a punch biopsy.  The next week was awful, waiting for the result. It was benign. I was over the moon and moved on from it, just dealing with the pain in the right breast.  Anyway, I fell pregnant in September. The pain seemed to subside. Although in December it started again and this time further up and  into my armpit. I saw a doctor. She looked at my breast and said she was sure it was nothing, probably anxiety.  Ovdr the last few days the pain is back in the original area and now I have a rash in the same place!! So my worst nightmare comes up on google- could it be IBC? i have an appointment with my gp at lunchtime.  I also have a private appointment with a breast surgeon on Tuesday as I\u2019m so anxious.  I just wondered if anyone had experienced anything similar. I\u2019m so scared with being pregnant, would I be able to have tests or treatment without harming my baby?",
