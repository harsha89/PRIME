      "Content": "my oncologist says it is up to me if i have chemo or not. Says i will only get a 2% benefit over 5 years and 3% over ten. Don't know what to do. My cancer was 6cm but not in lymph nodes and i had clearance. Had a skin sparing mastectomy on both breasts although cancer only in 1. AnyoneÂ  else in this situation. Don,t want to put myself through chemo if i don't have to. I am also coeliac which is an auto immune disease so that is also a risk factor with chemo because that affects your immune system. Oncologist says I have a 2 or 3% risk factor so one seems to outweigh the other. Am i making sense.",
