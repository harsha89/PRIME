    "Content": "Hi Jules I know you posted sometime ago now but I felt I should share with you, I have been on Tamoxifen for nearly two years now and apart from the hot flushes which my oncologist says means the drugs are doing what they are supposed to do I have had no other side affects, so its not all bad and its not forever.Â  Hope your treatment is going ok. Best wishes Kimmy46",
