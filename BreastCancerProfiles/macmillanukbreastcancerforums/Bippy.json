      "Content": "Dear Margieb Thank you for taking the time to post a comment, Your very kind . I have been very worried about voicing how strongly I feel that the hormone route may not be for me personally, but will ask for more info once my rads are over . I too have been prescribed letrozole and I may decide to try it and see how I feel . i have been given fantastic care so far, but I did feel that this was a rushed end of consultation discussion when I had a check up after my second op as I did not have clear margins following my first.  I hope you find the side affects manageable and wish you the very best as well x  Ps my daughter and husband are in Valencia this week for a holiday ... they keep sending me pictures of the warm weather, which is sadly missing from my part of the uk at the moment",

      "Content": "Dear Rosie1947 Thank you for replying Yes I too asked if I could have some info on statistics on outcomes with and without hormone treatment. His reply was that I needed to concentrate on getting well not statistics. I was diagnosed with invasive Er+ and dcis following a routine mammogram on 3 Jan this year and it all happened so fast I haven't really had chance to catch my breath . I do feel that I am very very fortunate to have had it caught so early and before it has spread to my lymph nodes but I still feel that I have to live in this body 24/7 . I just wish they would be more open to discuss the outcomes in more detail so you can feel supported in the action you choose . It's a scary enough journey as it is . I start rads next week , so my fingers are crossed I get through ok with no problems . Ps sorry just getting to grips with using this wonderful resource, please forgive any hiccups along the post !",

      "Content": "Dear rosie1947 I have read your post with interest and some reassurance as I'm in the process of making the decision whether to take hormone tabs post radio therapy and feel exactly as you do that I would rather have a quality of life v quantity. My husband is fully with me on this but my thoughts have at times been met by gasps of horror that I'm being stupid to take this decision and as I type this feel very confused and have been made to feel like I'm being \"selfish\"bizarrely, ! It's going to be a tough decision to make for me but thank you I feel that my thoughts are not totally out there, that others do feel the same as myself .",
