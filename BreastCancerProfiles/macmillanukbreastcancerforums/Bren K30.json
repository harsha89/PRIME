    "Content": "I registered with my local surgery when I moved in 1983, since then I have moved 4 times, the last three times in a different town from where I originally was registered. I will not change my doctor. During one visit to see him, before the present health problem he mentioned that I needed to change, I told him why I wouldn't change and he said that he felt very flattered to have me say what I did. The only drawback I have because of my choice is that I do not have the option of a home visit. That is a small price to pay because it's something I have never had to ask for in my life. I request repeat prescriptions by letter and enclose an sae. I can book a telephone consultation if I want to. When I do need to attend surgery I have a 10 mile drive from home. This, to me, is offset by the 1 mile journey I have to the hospital currently treating me. Many people probably have the opposite with a one mile trip to doctors but 10 mile to hospital. It is a large practice with about 10 doctors, there is only one who I would decline an appointment with and wait a longer time for an alternative. When I do arrive at reception for an appointment I have got into the habit of asking how late my doctor is running. That used to annoy me until I realized just how much time I was getting (and therefore everyone else was as well) during my consultation, with him discussing the condition and treatments fully. It's worth the wait, (and I always have a book anyway) When my daughter was diagnosed with quite severe asthma as a baby the service we got from all the doctors was wonderful, We did have to call out a doctor during the night on a few occasions. I don't think we ever had more than a 15 minute wait from the call to the door knocking. Thank you Castlefields Health Centre.",
