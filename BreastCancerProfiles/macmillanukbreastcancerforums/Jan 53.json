I should have had my MRI last Thursday but the scanner at my lovely hospital is tiny and my back was scraping along the top of the scanner. My surgery was planned for the 23rd Oct but had been cancelled until Nov 6th because I need to go to Newcastle for my MRI now. It's natural to be scared, I was terrified when they told me. The waiting between appointments has been the worst. I just want my surgery and treatment to get started. I've been very positive, of course I've had an occasional lapse, but I feel stronger for being so positive. If you're normally strong try and stay strong. I gave myself a good taking too the night I found out and said, there's nothing you can do about it, it's not a cold, it won't disappear overnight. What I did do was a bit of retail therapy, that cheered me up. I'm not sure whether I've helped, I know you'll get through it, as we all will.",
