    "Content": "I started 10 mg citalopram 6 weeks ago and have experienced a huge reduction in my anxiety.   Maybe I will go to the recommended dose of 20mg but not sure at the moment Before that the GP would only ever give me 8 tablets at a time of 2 mg diazepam and therefore was in control of how often I used them which he said should not be more than once a day and not more than twice a week.  They worked really well for a specific anxiety attack but he said they were addictive and if I took any more I would just have to keep increasing the dose.  When my husband was diagnosed with NSCLC Stage 3 the anxiety became unmanageable and he prescribed citalopram.  For me it has been wonderful and I have not needed any diazepam at all.  So that's my experience but as for advice, I don't really know, except that if it were me, if anything I'd be slowly reducing the diazepam and staying on citalopram, especially with the added stress you have.  Hope you and the doctor can work out a regime that will really help.  All the very best Judy",
