      "Content": "Hello -  I found a lump in my armpit on Sunday, went to the doctors Monday and was referred to the breast clinic and received a phone call this morning asking me to go in this afternoon. I am 25 and feeling quite sick now. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at 43. I'm trying to keep positive and tell myself I'm sure it's nothing but I also feel like I need to prepare myself incase I hear news that everything isn't ok. I don't really know what to expect at the breast clinic? I've read up on it but still feel extremely anxious...  What happened with your appointment? How long did it last? Did they tell you there and then the results?  xx",

      "Content": "Thank you all for the support, I had convinced myself the lump was nothing and it was nothing but then the 2nd lump has thrown me a little, I feel like my having a lump that was nothing chance has been used up. Such stupid thinking, I just feel sick now. Hopefully the week will fly or they'll call earlier again. The doctor was the same one my mum had and said he thought he recognised me as we look very similar, it is all just a bit close to home for me... Xx ",
