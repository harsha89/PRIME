    "Content": "My friends friend has been diagnosed with cancer in both her breasts and has ask me, as I am in remission from throat cancer, to seek some advice for her. Can any body help. Lynn(not her real name) has aggressive cancer which has spread from one breast to another in just a week. She offered to have both breats removed, but was told it is incurable. Her chemotherapy, she tells us will take only one and a half hours, and she has not been offered radiotherapy, but HRT. My friend is very concerned because her friend's experience is so different from mine, and she is curious as to why her friend Lynn isn't being offered radiotherapy,and that the chemo will take such a short time. (she's having 6 sessions) Any advice?And why the HRT?.",
