    "Content": "Just been told today I need a mastectomy. I had a lumpectomy and lymph node sampling 2 weeks ago. The good news is there is no cancer in the lymph nodes as these will stay intact. The cancer that is left is ductile and will spread through the breast. I have to go back in a week and tell them what I have decided. After 2 weeks of worrying about what treatment I was going to have I had already looked at mastectomy and thought that I would have reconstruction and reduction on my large good breast. I do not need chemo or radiotherapy. Can anyone out there give me advice on reconstruction and reduction surgery at the same time as the mastectomy. Jackie",
