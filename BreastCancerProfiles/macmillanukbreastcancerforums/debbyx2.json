      "Content": "Sally, I was diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer in 2004, which had spread to my lymph nodes. This year I will be celebrating 5yrs all clear, and the oncologist has discharged me... I could of kissed him. To say I was scared on finding out I had breast cancer, would be an understatement. You are told to always stay positive(which is not that easy when you are alone!). So have faith girl,and talk about it to everyone who will listen. God bless. Debbie",

      "Content": "I dont know if this is coincidence, let me know if there is anyone out there who has experienced the same thing. Before I was diagnosed I became aware of a bad smell in my nose ( rotten) that went after treatment. I have spoken to a lady who has recently been diagnosed with a brain cancer and she says she can smell the same thing. I wondered if anyone has had this or is this just me?",
