      "Content": "Just joined here tonight and have never used forum before so apologies if I mess this up. My mum (Joan)  found a lump in Jan, had mastectomy in Feb and was then told cancer has spread to 2 of the 3 lymph nodes that were also removed.   Care transferred to Christies where she is due to start chemo (3 fec, then 3 docetaxel) followed by removal of rest of lymh nodes and radation.  First appt at Christies yesteryday. I was in charge of asking questions and although doc was nice, I still have more. Doc said her CT scan result showed an abnormality with her skeleton and that they therefore wanted to do an MRI scan.  I asked what she meant by \"abnormaility\" (was thinking secondary bone cancer) but doc said she didnt' know and that the message from the radiographer had not been specific to one bone - but referred to whole skeleton.  She also said mum has Grade 3 cancer but didn't mention a \"stage\"> So - could mum have bone cancer in ALL her bones?  And, when will she be \"staged\". If you made it this far - thank you! Sarah (one of Joansgirls)",

      "Content": "Just logged on again this morning - thanks for your comments and for sharing your experiences.  I am fairly bolshy in real life but have a real need for the doctors to LIKE us/mum (as if this will somehow make them do a better job!). We find waiting plus lack of information a killer!. It will be three months from discovering lump to Chemo which sounds like a short time but has felt like a life time.  Once we have MRI scan results I will push for a stage.  Christies is great but can't get through to mum's nurse at all (could do with knowing if she has a slot in the day when she receives calls or not).  It's a whole new world isn't it?",
