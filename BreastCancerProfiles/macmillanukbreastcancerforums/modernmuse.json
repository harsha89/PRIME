    "Content": "Hi wisco 1 I was diagnosed with a dcis and had a lumpectomy and 3 nodes removed 2 weeks ago. I'm still waiting for my results. I think I'm in denial as to how serious a dcis could be. You read that because it's in situ it's not that serious. Your thread has made me realise that it is serious. Chemo isn't given for no reason. If being paranoid makes you SEEK ANSWERS then be paranoid.Â  Take care Diane x",
