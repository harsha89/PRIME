      "Content": "Hi Caroline I finished my rads two weeks ago and honestly there is nothing to be scared of, I am the biggest wimp going but the team were so kind to me and explained everything that was going to happen. They played music in the room so it relaxes you and I even got as far as joking with the nurses about my favourite football team. I was lucky in having a lift every day because I did get tired but the sunburn is not as bad as you think. I am now in the weepy stage too fiddley fingers and get very cross with myself because all in all I have been very lucky . Good luck to you all and be proud of your little black dots ( which incidentally do not hurt) x",

I have good days and bad but on the whole good so please don't rush back to work just for the sake of it. X",

      "Content": "Hello all I am post surgery and radiotherapy by 4 months and hopefully all is well, but just recently my arm, chest and underarm have become very sore. Almost like I've pulled muscles somewhere, I do my exercises religiously and cream the affected side. So why do I feel like I can hardly move ? Is this a radiotherapy side effect ? Am having to take pain killers to get me through the day. I feel more stiff now than when I first had surgery. Anyone got any ideas as I don't want to go to my doctor unless I really have to. Thanks all happy christmas x",

I guess I am still not quite back to normal yet but fingers crossed I will be soon. Happy Christmas",
