      "Content": "Hi Rosie.  He was taking Dutasteride (Avodart) for an enlarged prostate and had been taking it for 15 years. Apparently it raises estrogen levels in the body.  I'm pretty sure when he first started taking it one of the possible side effects was listed as 'breast tenderness and/or swelling' but it now actually says 'breast cancer'.   ",

      "Content": "Hi Rosie, its a real dilemma isn't it? My husband is 76 years old and has Parkinson's.  He was diagnosed with BC and had a left mastectomy and axillary dissection towards the end of February.  The tumour was 2.5 cm, grade 3, Her-2 neg, ER+ and 1 of the 8 nodes removed was infected. The surgeon was very pleased with how it went and told us they had clear margins and got it all, and the next stage was probably radiotherapy and possibly chemo, followed by Tamoxifen.   Anyway, we met with the clinical and medical oncologists (both same day) and we were told that they did not think my husband would benefit from radiotherapy or chemo. That was a shocker!!  They did however recommend Tamoxifen for 5 years.  He hates taking drugs, even more so as it is very possible one he was taking caused the BC in the first place.  Well he gave the Tamoxifen a go for a short while, experienced some breathlessness, thumping heart and dizziness and has now decided to stop taking it. He says his PD is hard enough to deal with and can't take any more misfunctioning of his body!  I am pleased for him and scared in equal measure. Who knows what the future will bring; I will do my best to research natural therapies and hopefully get some good advice here.  Good luck Rosie with your appointment and your decision x",

      "Content": "My husband's tumour was 2.5cm, and was described as early stage grade 3 treatable, HER-2 neg, ER+. He is doing well after the mastectomy and lymph dissection although we have been going weekly to our cancer nurse to get the seroma drained (4 so far I think, fluids look normal). The last time we saw the surgeon she gave him a prescription for Tamoxifen but told him not to take it if he was going to have chemo. We have separate appointments soon to see the clinical and medical oncologists which we understand is to discuss radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments.  We feel very nervous about future treatment, side effects, quality of life etc.  The thing is my husband is not your \u2019regular' breast cancer patient.  Firstly he is a man but also he is in his 70s and has Parkinson's Disease for which he takes medication 4 times daily. He really hopes they will take all of this into account and that things will be clearer in our minds after the appointments.  I read about the Oncotype test, is that done as a matter of course or would we need to request it? Also is it usually difficult to get copies of letters and the pathology report? I was told weeks ago they were being sent but we have received nothing.  What about the MDT meetings, are those notes not available to patients?  So sorry for all the questions but I wanted to get it all on paper for you lovely lot so you can comment at will!    I also wanted to mention that it is a very strong possibility apparently that my husband's breast cancer was caused by a drug called Dutasteride which he had taken for many years for a benign enlarged prostate.  It causes increased estrogen levels. Thanks everyone, scary times ",

      "Content": "Thanks, we were over the moon. Stunned actually, took a while for it to sink in. We are still talking about Tamoxifen because he is so worried about any drug reacting with his PD meds and of course the side effects. The doc mentioned a risk of blood clots too; don't think my husband is too keen..... Our GP told my husband to stop taking the Dutasteride as soon as he was diagnosed and we have an appointment to see the urologist, not until July though unfortunately. I must admit though I hadn't thought about prostate and tamoxifen. I celebrated for both of us.  My poor husband was exhausted yesterday and had an early night so I helped him out and had his glass of bubbles",

Separately, both specialists told us that taking everything into account they are of the opinion that there would be very little to gain and that my husband need not undertake either. Yay! There is a small chance of recurrence however and they are recommending Tamoxifen so we now need to think about that.  Thank you all for your wonderful support x",

      "Content": "Here I am again.  After the initial euphoria from the news that my husband does not have to endure radiotherapy or chemotherapy, I am back down to earth and worried.  The recommendation is that he takes Tamoxifen for 5 years. It just doesn't sit right; a drug that he was putting into his body for years (Dutasteride) appears to have caused the breast cancer and now he is supposed to take another drug for years supposedly to prevent it coming back.  Makes me nervous.  I have read that Tamoxifen can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50%, so if my husband's risk of recurrence for example was 10% then the benefit of the drug would be only 5%, is that right?  I wonder if the oncologists are able to give a recurrence % from the path report,  should I request that?    I must say that we have received wonderful treatment.  We've been signed off by all other than the BC nurse but feel we need to talk more about this. ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. We met with my husband's lovely surgeon today. She had the pathology report and told us it was good news, that the tumour was 2.5 cm, grade 3 and only 1 of the 8 nodes removed was infected. It was described as early stage treatable.  She said they have clear margins and they got it all.  We are to meet with the medical oncologist soon to discuss further treatment and that radiotherapy and hormone therapy (tamoxifen) were discussed at the mdt meeting. We weren't told what his HER2 rating is and I didn't think to ask. I guess I should also have asked for a copy of the path report.  Funny how your mind goes blank the minute you walk into the room, and I'm not even the patient!! We will have to carefully discuss the next step, my husband is in his seventies and has Parkinsons.  I wonder if anyone out there is taking Madopar (PD) and Tamoxifen?   ",

Does anyone have experience please of dealing with cancer and Parkinson's?  Thank you.",
