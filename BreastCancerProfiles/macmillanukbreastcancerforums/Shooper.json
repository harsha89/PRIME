    "Content": "Hi All,  Sadly I am joining you in the May chemo club.  I had my first round of FEC on Tuesday, I've been tired and nauseous since then, like a bad hangover I suppose, not as bad as I was expecting. I'm having 3 x FEC and 3 x T and Carboplatin.  Yesterday and today I have this awful taste in my mouth, I tried using corsodyl this morning but it actually seems to have made it worst.  Any ideas or am I just going to have to out up with it.  Any advice greatly appreciated.  Thanks  Sarah x",
