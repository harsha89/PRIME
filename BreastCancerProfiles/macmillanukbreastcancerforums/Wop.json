      "Content": "Hi there.   I was so pleased to find this thread.  I only finished radiotherapy last week and I feel somewhat less worthy as my diagnosis was high grade dcis that only required surgery and radiotherapy but no chemo thankfully.  Not sure about meds as have to meet with oncologist again but they've not been mentioned yet so fingers crossed I won' need them.  I went to the gym today (gentle workout!) and plan to return to work in a couple of weeks so life is getting back to normal.  But after the whirlwind of the last few months getting back to normal does feel scary.   X",

      "Content": "Hi there, I had a wide local excision for high grade dcis in November 17 and then 15 sessions of radiotherapy that finished on 2nd February 18.  I've noticed a lump has appeared at the bottom of my scar.  I still get shooting type pains in my breast and my nipple area changes colour constantly.  I have an appointment in May at the breast clinic but wonder if I need to contact my breast care nurse sooner - I don't  want to waste anyone's time or over react. - this may be perfectly normal.  Thanks for any advice or comments . Kind regards, Jan",
