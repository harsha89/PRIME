    "Content": "Hi, My Mum has just been diagnosed with a very small but cancerous lump in her breast. I don't have specific knowledge on breast cancer and was wondering if anyone can recommend the best books to read. I've spotted one called 'Be a Survivor' that looks good for general information. I would love to get some specifically looking at nutrition for people going through treatment, including completementary therapies like homeopathy/naturopathy as well as general eating and exercise guide. Any recommendations would be very much appreciated? Thanks",
