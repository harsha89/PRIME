    "Content": "Hi I\u2019m not sure if I can put this here. A couple of days ago I noticed I had a strange looking red bruise at the side of my nipple. Which then got bigger turned into a red patch which started going abit dry after being irritated. then all of a sudden I start getting them all over my breasts literally under on them in between them. ive now today discovered I\u2019ve got more red lumps in my armpit, but they\u2019re also on my neck. It\u2019s basically one big rash over my breasts making its way up. not on my tummy or back or legs or arms. Just around that area.Â  I\u2019m wide awake in discomfort with this and need a bit of advice and now I\u2019m getting majory paranoid this could be something serious. Especially with the mark that appeared next to my nipple. If anyone had this and it turned out to be some type of breast cancer please help me out. As it\u2019s now drilled into my head it might be this Thanks so much x",
