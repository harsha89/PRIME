      "Content": "Hi, I had exactly the same issue regarding the horrible taste in the mouth and not being able to taste food went with it. I thought it would never end. My chemo finished at the end of May and now I'm happy to say those 2 side effects are a distant memory. It does get better. Good luck xx",

      "Content": "Good morning Linn, I had this very surgery on the 7 weeks ago. Have to say I'm really happy with my results, especially my nipple reconstruction, I know it might sound a little strange, but some how I feel more balanced in that area. My scarring is still a little red, my surgeon recommended I buy ProSil Silicone Scar Stick Keloid and Hypertophic Scar Glide on, which I was able to source from Amazon, hopefully should arrive tomorrow. Good luck with your surgery! xx",
