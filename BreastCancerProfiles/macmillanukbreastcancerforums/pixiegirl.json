      "Content": "Hi Winky, I had DCIS ( grade 3 - non invasive) and was told that after the WLE I could safely wait up to 16 weeks before radiotherapy, as I wanted to find out the results of my BRACA gene test before I went ahead. Luckily the results were negative and I have now finished my radiotherapy treatment - although I did wait the full 16 weeks beforehand. My consultant was not worried about the delay.  Hope this helps, Maxine",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I wonder if anyone has experienced shoulder and neck pain shortly after radiotherapy?   I finished my 15 sessions of RT in July and everything was fine at first, but now I've started experiencing a stiff neck and shoulder/back pain on the RT side.  It's not too bad during the day, but at night the whole area stiffens up and I'm finding it really hard to sleep. Has this happened to anyone else?  I'm  so scared of long term radiotherapy damage. I've tried massage/hot water bottle/ painkillers, but they only seems to help temporarily.  It's got so bad that I am awake half the night and very grumpy and tired during the day! I'd be really grateful for any advice and/or similar experiences that would set my mind at rest. Thanks so much, Pixie xxx",

Wishing you all the best for your treatment, Maxine",

Unfortunately I don't think that I have  enought time to research this option and put it into place. I wish I had known this before my surgery. Very best wishes, Maxine",
