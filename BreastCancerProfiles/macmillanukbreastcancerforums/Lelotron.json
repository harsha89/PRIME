      "Content": "Following on from my lump and bleeding from my left nipple, today I thought I was going to get some answers but the results of my FNA were inconclusive. They were testing the bloody fluid that they drained last week. I was asked to return to the hospital this afternoon for a core biopsy. Whilst talking to the radiologist I explained that I was really concerned about the pain I was having in my armpit. She told e she would have a look there before starting the other procedure. She advised that my lymphnodes were enlarged (despite me not being ill) and she needed to do an FNA. Next up was the core biopsy - wow - that really hurts and im in a lot of pain right now. She did explain that because of the location of the area she needed to get to(behind by nipple) that it would be super sore.I had three lidocaine injections and 3 samples taken. It took over an hour because the location was difficult. There was a lot of whispering going on and its making me feel super nervous. Does anyone know how long NHS corebiosy results usually take? I'm thinking it bad news already and with the stress of my dad being terminally ill I think Im going to make myself sick with worry.",

      "Content": "After suffereing with bloody discharge and a lumpy left boob I visited the doctor on my mums birthday - 9th October. After various FNAs, a core biopsy and a micro ductecotomy 2 weeks ago (and after the consultant constantly telling me not to worry its likely just a papilomma) on Thursday I was diagnosed with hugh grade DCIS.  I always knew my own body and knew I wouldnt get an all clear result. Its been such a horrible few months as my Dad passed away from cancer on 1st November but my gut always told me I had something awful inside me. Following the MDT I have been advised to have a wide excision on 8th January - if we can get clear margins then radiotherapy will follow and Tamoxifen if I test positive for it. If its not successful and we have no clear margins then I will need a mastectomy. Now because of my Dad dying, and not wanting to put myself at any more risk (especially with having young children) I really just want to have a mastectomy. Im actually thinking of asking them to do a double mastectomy as I have found lumps on my right side this morning too. This DCIS does not appear on any ultrasound or mammogram that I have had so it's invisible and thats my worry. If it cant be seen then any follow up scans I have in future would not show anything untoward. Even more worrying is that i have had this constant pain under my left arm and across my collar bone so Im convinced that something untowards is going on there too. Does anyone have any advice at all? I honestly think I just want both boobs gone.",

His funeral is on Friday.  Aside from the original symptoms of lump, underarm pain and bloody discharge I now have this nagging pain across my collar bone and into my shoulder. Has anyone else has this?  I'm convinced now Its got me too ",

Can anyone please tell me what to expect? I'm just booked in as a day case but what should i expect from a recovery time perspective? Im thinking operation Thursday so back to work Monday.  What is the pain like with it being such a sensitive area. I'm told they make the incision around the areola. Quite scared at the prospect but I know its for the greater good. Thanks in advance x",

I had my microductectomy on Thursday afternoon and the doctor gave me a sick note for one week and sent me off with codiene and paracetemol. I have to say the pain seems tobe getting gradually worse and for the past 24 hours ive been feeling very dizzy and off balance. Strangely putting my DVT socks back on has helped these symptoms?! Im very swollen and bruised and the area directly under my nipple is completely numb. I have to go back for the results of the diagnostics on Thursday 21st. Im preying for clear results and hoping that the op id the last of my troubles.",
