      "Content": "hi everyone.  I was diagnosed with stage 3 Breast Cancer last Jan.  Nodes in clavicle and neck were effected. When I try for travel insurance they have no category for me!  It has left my armpit but I have not been diagnosed with secondary BC.  The cost increases almost 10 times (£300 plus).  I have talked on the phone to insurance agents but they cannot change their assessment formula.  I have to be insured as outside of armpit which then asks questions about secondary BC.  I am traveling to Netherlands from U.K.  Advice welcome! Jill (Doc's wife)",
