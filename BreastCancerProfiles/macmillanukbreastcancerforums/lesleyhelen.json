      "Content": "Hello Clarkie 13  Well done for going to your GP yesterday.  As has been said, sometimes these lumps can turn out to be nothing, but as others of us have found, they can also be cancer.  A majority of cases do turn out to be nothing, so we will all be wishing you the very best that it turns out to be a harmless cyst or something. If and only if it turns out to be cancer, please be reassured that it is all very achievable.  There are so many advances in breast cancer treatment etc.  My lump was found on my first ever mammogram, so it was probably there a lot longer than 3 months (as I had 4.5cm of DCIS as well), so don't go panicking that 'you've left it too late' type thing. The waiting is always the worst bit, but if and only if it is cancer once you are being treated you will find that you will feel a whole lot better.   I had an 8cm lumpectomy (as I had DCIS and a 1.5cm tumour) and only had one day off work.   3 months later, I drove myself the 60 miles to and from radiotherapy every day for 15 days. I didn't need to have chemotherapy. I was clearly one of the 'lucky' ones who sailed through everything and other ladies (for no reason other than being unlucky; had bad side effects) - but not everyone's experience is horrendous - so for the ladies who've just been diagnosed and for you if it does turn out to be so, do take each step at a time. Kindest wishes,",

      "Content": "Hello Arthen  I'm not on herceptin, but am on anastrozole.  Unfortunately the side effects individually for these tablets are aching bones,joints.  Herceptin I see, has a side effect of bleeding (it also says tell your doctor about it).  But interestingly, I now bruise so easily - at any time I can now have 4 or 5 bruises on my forearms - so much so that they are people who will jokingly ask who's been beating me up - and I suspect that it might be due to the anastrozole even though it's not on the list of side effects. The different types of drug can make a difference.  I try and ask for the accord of anastrozole all the time as it has less E numbers than others I have been given.  When I had 2 months on another type, my thumb joint was agony - even to the touch and looked red and swollen.  Within 2 days of being on accord brand of anastrozole it eased.  It could be worth asking for a different brand (trial and error) and see which brand suits you the best. Hopefully you'll get some more information from ladies who are on both, but I hope this helps in the meantime. Best wishes,",

      "Content": "Hi Salxxx  Your BC nurse must be a 'good un' - and it's so good to hear that inodine is being used widely, as to me it's been the best thing that they have used on my leg for the last 2 years.   The microbiologist recommended a different one and my nurse stopped it after 2 months and we have gone back to inodine as it seems to be so good - even cleansing my wound which has MRSA, so fingers crossed that it soon works its magic on your blister which I assume is 'just open' and isn't infected. If you click on my name and take a look at my profile I've kept a 'log' of all my appointments etc. in date order for my BC(I didn't have chemotherapy, so my journey was an easy one in comparison - great for me, but I do appreciate I was a very lucky lady and other ladies have had it so much worse than me x ), but I think that they wait for your breast to heal from the internal effects of surgery before starting radiotherapy, so I'm glad you have been reassured about the timescale.   Each month there is a radiotherapy thread and you may want to join in with this one when you do have your radiotherapy.  I've also realised it was about 2 months, rather than 3 months before I started radio - but it still is plenty of time for your blister to heal and I know 100% that radiotherapy is a LOT easier than your chemotherapy.   I actually enjoyed my daily outings to the hospital 30 miles away from me as I treated myself to a vanilla late coffee at the hospital after each one and enjoyed the daily drives, so I looked forward to that every day! (ok I know I'm not normal....;) - but it was nice to chat to other ladies and found the radio team extremely supportive). Kindest wishes,",

The best dressing I have ever had on my leg is inodine - it looks like gauze, but it has iodine in it - fantastic for drying out the wound and helping it heal.   But it does stain your skin and clothes yellow, so would need a padded plain dressing over it.  You could try getting some from the chemist and taking them when you next go to your BC nurse for her to dress it for you.  I have surgical gloves on prescription so that I can do my own dressings or I would spend my whole life at the doctors but be wary about doing things yourself because if some part of your body is 'weaker' the bugs get in and your breast has been through a hard time lately!",

My next mammogram is in June (I am on holiday the first week in June).  I was told 'check your breasts regularly' as we all are - but tbh I wouldn't have a clue what feels normal and what isn't -even in my good breast!  I didn't even know I had cancer in the first place and it was just because I had my first ever mammogram that I was diagnosed.   Mine is sometimes painful and feels lumpy - and it was in June 2018 as well, when I had my first annual and this was fine. So I'm working on the premise the radiotherapy did and the tablets are; doing their job and it's normal (and hope that my annual falls in the second - fourth week of June).  I have had to get my head around the idea that 'whatever will be will be' or else I won't be living my life in the meantime.  A lot easier said that done of course - but how on earth can we tell what's normal and what's not?  Maybe it's a case of burying my head in the sand until my annual, but I guess that's the way I can enjoy the rest of the year. We have the 'nicest' type of breast cancer and we are protected daily with the anastrozole, so do your best not to worry until your appointment. Kindest wishes,",

Mine wasn't an itchy rash though (although it itched a bit), so if you find it too much, I'd suggest you either pop to your doctor to get a different cream or speak to your BC nurse to get a suggestion what type of cream would be best for it.

I drove over 60 miles (there and back) to my radio - and I also didn't realise that parking was free, so had to find a side road to park in away from the hospital.  When I was there, one lady also drove herself daily after work, like me, but she said she'd been falling asleep at her desk and I did wonder how safe she was behind the wheel!  Another lady I met was the same as me - perfectly ok.   When I discussed things, the one thing I noted was the lady with fatigue wasn't drinking very much - she was only having one cup of tea during the day at work.  I made sure I was drinking pints of squash, coffee and green tea and then treated myself to a large 'posh coffee' from the hospital coffee shop for on the way home.  I am convinced drinking loads was what prevented my fatigue.  They advise drinking plenty of fluids as well. I did have lifts lined up for the back end (ie the last week) as I didn't know how I'd react, but didn't need them.  So maybe worth getting them on the rota just in case you need them. Best wishes,",

I exercised to a dvd for 20 minutes a day during my radiotherapy and drank loads of water.  (both strongly advised to reduce side effects).   I work part time employed and part time self employed. During the 3 weeks of radio, I closed my business so that the time I spent driving to and from radio (2 hours) and the sessions were basically the time I would have spent working at my own business.  I felt that this helped me, inasmuch that I wasn't doing more than normal.   Radiotherapy was fine for me, I have a fixed right elbow due to a road accident, so they adapted the position for me as I couldn't get both arms above my head - just said it would take them more calculations.  I suffered no tiredness whatsoever and being with other ladies in the same position was rather nice - I enjoyed the chats.  I rewarded myself after each session with a lovely vanilla late from the hospital's coffee shop. Radiotherapy doesn't hurt a bit, I only got a tingly hand twice during my 15 sessions and it was a 'doddle' When it was initially suggested by the breast surgeon that because I needed 8cm cut out (due to needing a 1cm clear margin), I might not be able to have a lumpectomy, I was horrified and absolutely devastated!  Luckily I was big enough to have the lumpectomy.  I had the operation on the Wednesday, had Thursday off work and was driving to work on the Monday.  I know if I had had a mastectomy, recovery would have been SO much harder and much longer.  I think as other ladies have said radiotherapy is the 'belt and braces' to prevent it coming back and for me, anything to prevent the worry and the fear of having it again was worth it.  The fear of radio was far, far worse than radio itself - it is now a distant memory!  I finished radio mid October and on 20th December I was sunning myself in Sri Lanka, following a 10 hour flight - again, no side effects. My breast nurse was pretty rubbish too tbh.  If I hadn't had the breast care folder, I wouldn't have known half of what I did and she was unable /unwilling to answer the only 2 questions I asked! so I gave up asking her any more.",

However, I wonder if the letrozole would actually have had much impact on your body in 3 days as I've read many posts from ladies wanting to stop AI's and their oncologist saying that a \"3 week break wouldn't be concerning\". Could it be something else? Or could it be just the fact your mind is thinking that you've lost your safety net of protection that these AI's give us?  It's incredible the power of the mind and what it does to us.  I was in a really stressful job once (I was covering managing a bank branch where the previous 2 managers had suffered mental breakdowns). After 9 months a new manager was appointed and when I was told that I was going back to my previous job - wow!  I couldn't believe it how a physical weight suddenly felt as if it was being lifted from my shoulders, I still remember the feeling to this day and it's nearly 20 years ago.  I just hadn't realised how stressful a position I had been in for those 9 months and goodness only knows what I would have been like to live with - I was single at the time. You've had a major change to your treatment plan for cancer so could this possibly be having an effect on your mind?",

      "Content": "Hello knighty and welcome to our community, but equally - sorry that you find yourself here because of your Mum's diagnosis. As others have said, it depends on many factors with your Mum.  Especially - age and type of breast cancer she has/ spread of the cancer. As an idea I had an 8cm lumpectomy - also known as a wide local excision (due to 1.5cm tumour and 4.5cm ofDCIS).  I had NO spread to my lymph nodes It was Grade 2, ER positive/ don't know about progesterone ;) / HER2 negative. So pretty similar to your Mum except for the minuscule spread to her lymph nodes.  Hormone therapy is given if the breast cancer is ER positive.  As I had no spread to my lymph nodes, I didn't have any chemotherapy, but had radiotherapy. I was 51 last year when I was diagnosed and post menopause - so on Anastrozole (or other women go on Letrozole).  Pre menopausal women as a general rule get given tamoxifen. Your Mum had minuscule cancer in her lymph nodes.  Normally chemotherapy is given if there is a spread to lymph nodes - but as it was minuscule, she's obviously being given the choice and whether to have them all removed.  She will also need to consider lymphedema risks which will be higher for total removal, rather than sentinel node removal. Take at a look at the predict NHS tool as this is what I actually used to decide if I wanted to take tablets for the next 5 years.  There is a box to tick for 'micromet' which refers to the detection of a tiny amount of malignant breast cancer cells in the lymph nodes and/or the sentinel node. No-one other than your Mum can make the decision - I'm very glad to have been 'clear cut' as it's not one many people would like to make!  She can play around with this tool, putting in chemo or non chemo etc.  I have a friend who had womb cancer and she said she had the choice of chemo or not and she asked her oncologist \"if I were your wife, what would you say to me\" - he told her that he would suggest his wife had chemo, so she did.  Maybe you Mum can ask her oncologist to give her their honest opinion, just as my friend did.  Clearly looking after your Dad with MS will be something which may influence your Mum, but as with all carers they tend to put themselves after their 'charge'.  I lost my Mum too soon because of that mentality when she was Dad's primary carer..... push your Mum to make the right decision for HER and not to consider other factors - ie what would her head tell her to do if she didn't have your Dad to care for.   Kindest wishes to both you and your Mum (and Dad!)",

      "Content": "Good morning OCRKate,  (as you are new, I don't think my system is tagging you in yet).  Welcome to the Macmillan online community, although, sorry that you find yourself here.   You will find that you are not alone on this site and your feelings of not being able to keep calm and being scared are shared by many, many women.   At the moment you are at one of 'the worst bits' - ie the waiting period.  And Trevor's not alone in being name either ;)... I am a very down to earth person, where normally nothing shakes me but even I was full of what if's and OMG I have cancer! when I was diagnosed - it is very surreal isn't it?.  So, the best advice I can give you is: (1) trust the experts as they do this a lot and know what they are doing (2) don't Google any old site - if you want to know something read your binder given to you at the hospital or read Cancer Research / Macmillan information.  There are an awful lot of dodgy sites out there as well as many out of date ones -even 2 days ago new tests were announced on the news for breast cancer. (3)If you are thinking the worst, then try also to think about the best possible outcome as well and it will help. There are many different types of breast cancer - ER+ /PR+, Triple negative, HER2+ do you know which type you have and what size your tumor is?  (the final confirmation will be when Trevor's cut out as to the exact size - but they will have a good idea now). Are you having a mastectomy or a lumpectomy (wide local excision WLE)?  Have they told you yet what to expect from your treatment plan? If you want to fill in your profile - click on your name and edit profile and you can put anything you want about yourself there as well as your specific diagnosis.  Then when you ask a question other ladies will be able to see a bit more information without you having to type it again each time you ask a question :) The in between time from diagnosis and operation is really a worrying time - but you can't do anything other than know that Trevor is going! I had my operation (WLE of 8cm - IDC 15mm and 2 areas of DCIS 34mm/20mm)  last year in July and I was amazed how well it went for me, down to surgery at 4.15pm, home at 7.30pm and back at work part time 2 days later - albeit a little sore.  So, you can see that it's not always that bad.  Clearly I was very lucky with my recovery etc but the advances in medicine daily that come along for breast cancer is just stunning.  I am sure 30 years ago I would have been in hospital for a long time, would have lost my breast and been off work for a year.  As it was, I felt so well throughout that I even drove myself the 60 mile round journey daily to radiotherapy.  (Not all IDC requires chemotherapy either - it depends on the type you have). So at this point, breathe and take a gentle look through your binder from breast cancer care - knowing that that not all potential problems listed will affect you. Kindest wishes, ",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectormy (8cm) and I went online to M&S post surgery bras - they were fully supportive and very comfortable to wear at night too.  I kept mine on for a couple of weeks after as my breast felt very uncomfortable (heavy and painful) without out it.  During radiotherapy, I also swapped with their sports bra as the skin under my breast became a little burned and rubbed - the sports bras have a wider band and were softer. You can get them delivered to your local store to avoid delivery costs and post surgery bras are also VAT free. I didn't buy any front fastening bras as I saw some had zips and was worried that the zip might rub.  So, for those ladies who aren't sure how to do up back fastening bras - I lost my elbow in a road accident at 17 and I therefore can't do up back fastenings.  I was taught by the rehabilitation team how to overcome anything without my elbow. With back fastening bras - have the bra around your waste and do the fastening up in the front at your waste and twizzle it around to the back.  Put your bad arm (ie: the side on which you have had operated) through the strap and bring the bra upwards, you can then easily shimmy your good side into the rest of the bra.   Hope this helps ",

      "Content": "Hi Kate, Then in that case you sound like you have a 'good' diagnosis.  The hormone positive is the nicest one to have.  Mine was Oestrogen positive (ER+ 8/8) and PR+, grade 2 (DCIS was negative ER/PR and grade 3, but treatment is based on the IDC) - no spread to lymph nodes - they suspected before and it was confirmed by the WLE.  At 1.8cm  they are looking at WLE for you and you may be having the new test that was on the radio 2 days ago (new research) for early stage breast cancer.  As you know there was no chemotherapy for me and mine was confirmed by surgery at 1.5cm, so only 3mm smaller than yours.  So, overall you can see from my experience that it might not be as horrendous as you first thought.  You will most likely be on tablets for 5 years (as hormone blockers) Exercise, I think for me was the key to staying healthy and having practically no side effects.  Doing the exercises after the operation and walking etc.  The day after finishing radiotherapy - I was back in the gym.  As exercise helps with your PTSD, then don't stop as it will most definitely help with your breast cancer, but obviously when you've had your operation, don't overdo it too quickly.  Sometimes even now, I forget and pick up something heavy and it aches over night.  But I did have a huge chunk chopped out ;) - you are likely to have 2.8cm as they'll want to get a 1cm clear margin around Trevor. Very best wishes for July!",

      "Content": "http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict_v2.0.html Take a look at this predictor tool from the NHS, I have found. I am taking Anastrozole since last week as I went through menopause 3 years ago at 48, but like you I debated not taking it and 'am giving it a go' until I know (as yet no obvious side effects ).But I want to know if it's affecting my bone density/ any other side effects. I have asked the oncologist for a bone scan density appointment when I saw him last week and that will be worth asking for if they don't mention it (as he didn't to me) and wrote it down on my notes only when I asked, so I don't think it was going to be offered.  I am also going to ask my doctor for further blood tests 6 months or a year down the line to compare my liver and kidney readings. However, when I asked about not taking hormone tablets to the surgeon and Macmillan breast cancer nurse and said about the prediction rate for me on the NHS predictor tool, they both looked at me blankly!!!  - and the surgeon said \"no, no it's 30%\".  As I am ER+ I asked the McMillan nurse if I could control oestrogen by diet and she said \"I don't know, try joining a forum\" followed quickly by \"You are on a green path, you can ring and ask any questions you like of us any time\".  Which I thought was very ironic as the only question I wanted answering whilst I was sat with her was that one - and surely that's her job to know? Then when I saw the oncologist last week (when he prescribed me Anastrazole) I asked the same questions (1) mortality, his answer \"1% increase per anum\" and (2) controlling oestrogen by diet - \"No, oestrogen is made by your body all the time\". I am therefore not relying too much on what the 'experts' say and am doing my own research as: (a) I'm not sure the breast cancer nurse gives too hoots. Other examples of poor 'service' from her during my 2 appointments with her where initially I had to wait an hour and a half for my appointment to be told I had cancer were: her rushing the consent form when I tried to raise a concern about lymphodoema (I lost my right elbow in a road accident at 17, so damage to my left arm with lymph node removal in my one and only good arm was not an option for me!)/ chatting to a colleague who came into the room so they could finish their paperwork for the day (as it was quite apparent they wanted to go home because other appointments had run over time) and the phrase \"now what else is it I have to tell you?\" whilst fishing out another leaflet, in my second appointment with her - I used to use this when I had a checklist for product literature I had to give out in a sales environment when I was bored with the interview, having done it a 1000 times before - but I wasn't dealing with someone's life then ;) (b) the surgeon and oncologist have completely different answers.   But, this is provided by the NHS based and to me it means exactly what I think - 1% increase of mortality - 5 years and 2% increase at 10 years.   Five year survival 96 out of 100 women are alive at 5 years with no adjuvant therapy after surgery  An extra 1 out of 100 women treated are alive because of hormone therapy  Ten year survival 90 out of 100 women are alive at 10 years with no adjuvant therapy after surgery  An extra 2 out of 100 women treated are alive because of hormone therapy Perhaps anyone else thinks I'm reading it totally wrong would let us know?",

      "Content": "Hi Frances, I didn't even bother asking my Doctor or BC nurse as both seem to be in a 'different world' and are both a bit useless!  To give you an idea, I had my first ever phone call from my Doctor 3 weeks ago (in the middle of radiotherapy) to confirm that I had MRSA in my breast. But in June 2016 (YES, 2016), I cut my leg (scar tissue from a road accident as a youngster) and it got infected.  I had IV antibiotics for a fortnight because it was MRSA.  It kept getting re-infected and I'd been going to the surgery ever since I was discharged from the hospital in August 2016.  I had asked the nurse at the Doctors to re-swab it as I still didn't believe it had cleared up.  I was correct, but I had to TELL my own Doctor that it was my leg and not my breast that had MRSA - frightening eh? My BC nurse said on 2nd out of the only two times I've had contact with her \"call me if you need to ask any questions\" so at that point,  I asked her if she knew if ER+ BC could be controlled with diet and she said \"I don't know, perhaps ask the oncologist\" , so I figured she's not much use either! Plus, I hadn't taken kindly to her rushing my diagnosis appointment because they were delayed by 1 1/2 hours and allowing someone to come in, in the middle of my appointment to 'finish some paperwork' and ask her a load of questions as they needed to get it finished off.  I had just been told I had cancer and these 2 nurses just wanted to get home for the day!  She'd also failed to tell me about the day before appointment for the radioactive injection which when I had it the staff said \"we've told them to tell people\"...and were clearly annoyed.  (As was I 'cause I'd reorganised work for my op and now had to re-organise it all again for this appointment). I now rely on myself and do my own research/speak to people who've been through it/this forum. I met an acquaintance in August who had breast cancer 10 years ago and she suggested: Radiance cream and put silk in your bra. I didn't need to bother with the silk. I bought the radiance cream - in fact I'm on my 3rd pot now as I finished radiotherapy on 12th October - 15 sessions, so I'm continuing to use it for the next 2-3 weeks as they say effects can worsen after finishing.   My skin looks sunburned in a strip across my breast and my under arm, but other than that it has been absolutely perfect!  I was asked on the 3rd session what cream I was using and after that the radio team didn't bother asking again, so they must deem it to be good.  I figured I would rather pay and get something that had worked for someone else than suffer any blisters etc.  I bought each pot individually not realising how quickly I'd get through it (I put it on 4 times a day during radio, including immediately after each session - now 3 times a day), so I could have saved myself some postage if I'd ordered the 3 pots together. https://www.ournaturalselection.com/Product.aspx?category=Toxin%20Free%20Products&Name=Radiance%20Skin%20Care&id=16350 Hope this helps x",

      "Content": "Hi Frillyflower  Your diagnosis sounds very promising inasmuch as when they are talking radiotherapy, they really don't expect to find any cancer cells in your sentinel lymph nodes.  It sounds as if they have caught you at early stages.  I was 51 on diagnosis and was told 5 years hormone tablets, so it may be your age or the fact your tumor is 5mm larger than mine that they are talking 10 years for the tablets.   Some ladies do suffer very bad side effects to the tablets and largely it will be the posts on this site from ladies who suffer - many ladies who are ok, aren't on here and managing perfectly well without any side effects.  So, if you see a lot of posts about hormone side effects don't be put off taking them until you have tried them.  Yes, there can be side effects but there are also different brands /different types which can be tried if you don't get on with them.  I've been on Anastrozole for 10 months and the only thing I've noticed really is that my hair is a little drier (hairdresser recommended kerotin shampoo and conditioner - made a big difference) and very occassionally an aching joint - nothing that bothers me too much and comes and goes anyway. The hormone tablets are to strip your body of oestrogen, so basically it's just like having the menopause.  I breezed through the menopause with no symptoms really, so it depends on how your body personally reacts to it (if that makes sense). Very best wishes for your operation and if you want to take a look at my profile (click my name) you will see a timeline of events for appointments etc.",

      "Content": "Hi Q63 Before I was diagnosed with cancer I thought there were far too many cancer adverts - almost every ad break on TV there seemed to be one!  Then I was diagnosed with cancer and understand it all a lot more being that there are so many different kinds of cancer.  However, I do personally think there are too many cancer charities with each one advertising for funds.  I'm sure it would be much better if there were a select few.  For instance for breast cancer - Breast Cancer Care (breast cancer guides in hospital) and Macmillan - breast care nurses and Cancer Research UK. These are the only ones I support and I constantly get bombarded with FB ads for plenty of other breast cancer charities, charity bags through the door for other breast cancer charities etc. etc. If the smaller ones 'teamed up' with the big names and came under their umbrella, it would be a lot more efficient and effective, I'm sure.  To me it feels as if it's an overkill and I've had cancer - which is no wonder why I was 'sick of the adverts' when I hadn't been personally touched by cancer. But, that said - it won't change I'm sure - and adverts in cinemas are where charities have a captive audience and gain much needed funds, so that probably won't change either.  I went to see \"The Mule\" on Sunday (I thought it was a fantastic film - although his ex wife died of cancer, so may not be a good film for some to watch) and the advert for Macmillan was on - the advert doesn't bother me at all, but I checked my watch for the start time of the film as we'd practically finished our popcorn before the film started!  There is a half hour of adverts/what's coming next before the start of the film, so if you wanted to (I know it's not ideal), but you could go in half an hour after the 'supposed' start time of the film to be able to enjoy the cinema without the fear of seeing an upsetting advert?",

      "Content": "Hello Emma J80  If someone doesn't come along with the same experience, I think you have answered your own question a little haven't you?  Your oncologist has said you'll be at no greater risk and the biggest battle is to stop your mind from thinking of the 'what if's'   I do have one example, when I had had my lumpectomy, I'd read about all the side effects on the Macmillan site - and didn't think that the women who were perfectly ok, wouldn't be posting - doh! but met a lady who was now 50 and had breast cancer at 40.  She'd worried about the side effects of the tablets and refused to take a single Tamoxifen tablet.  As I say, she's now 50, so if your oncologist says that you're at no higher risk for having a break, then it's time to trust the experts.   One of the things that I have also read that not having a child puts you at higher risk of having breast cancer - so there's another side to it isn't there? I never had kids and I got it ;)  So in actual fact you could even be reducing your risk of future breast cancer! Hopefully other ladies nearer your age will be able to give you some advice, but at least this is a little something to think about to perhaps help ease your worries a little in the meantime.

      "Content": "Hi xcturner I sort of get the impression that you are 'doing the diagnosis' of stage 4... has her oncologist said stage 4?  The fact that she has had her lymph nodes removed, the pathology should know/have known in a couple of weeks how much cancer was in those.  Have they told her?  Exactly how many lymph nodes did they remove?  To give you an example, a friend's Mum has a 30mm tumour with cancer in one lymph node so she's having a full clearance and because she is ER+ (oestrogen positive) and that it appears to be micro cancer cells in her lymph node then she is likely only to have radiotherapy with EXCELLENT life expectancy. From some of the things you have written and the research you have done, it almost seems as if you are the one diagnosing her stage - am I right?  If I am, it does appear that not all the facts are known to you because you're not in the appointment with her. Do you know what type of cancer she has - 3 lumps could be anything really (yes 3 tumours, but what type of tumours are they? ER+/PR+? HER2? Inflammatory? Triple Negative? IDC, LDC etc etc - It is SO important for her to get the actual diagnosis from the 'horse's mouth' - i.e. the team looking after her with ALL the facts, rather than from general research because until the results of the lymph nodes and the MRI come back, you really can't tell what stage she is and know 100% what her treatment plan will be.  It may well automatically involve chemotherapy because IF it Is in a lymph node, because of her age the 'belts and braces' will be a bit more thorough than someone in their 80's for instance.   At this moment, you and she don't know (and neither do her team) what that 'something' is that they have seen on her spine and neck and it is very important for you and your Mum to be positive for your sister - she will be frightened enough without having to worry about the both of you as well.  This may sound harsh but having experienced breast cancer, she really could do without 'propping you two up' as well.  If you and your Mum are preparing for the worst - where does that leave her?   You and your Mum need to be supporting her by being positive about the outcome.   Yes, your worlds have been turned upside down by your sister's diagnosis and it realy is wonderful how much clearly love and care for your sister, but equally your love and care appears to be projecting your fears into the situation instead of being the one who should be strong for your sister. I can only reiterate that until you know WHAT the diagnosis is, then and only then can you start helping her face the treatment plan. Looking on the 'worst possible scenario' side for your sister is the LAST thing that she needs at the moment.  She NEEDS you to be telling her that you're there for her and will carry on being the babysitter when she's having treatment etc.  Not worrying her to death with your fear that she's got stage 4 breast cancer - when in actual fact it could be something or nothing on her spine and neck and she's actually grade 1 or 2.  Yes, of course it could be stage 4, but again this isn't an automatic death sentence for her.   Until you believe this and understand that until you know what you're all dealing with, then you will have difficulty being calm about the situation, so at this point I really would advise you to stop researching and just concentrate on the facts that you have in hand - and until Monday when she gets the results of the MRI you really don't have all the facts.  I know how difficult it is for loved ones to cope because you are going through it too, so don't think I don't understand how awful this is for you and your Mum too - but try and remember that your sister is the one facing it and she needs your strength and positive attitude to get her through this, not your worries.

      "Content": "Hello xcturner A warm welcome to this community, although naturally very sorry to have you along here because of your sister.   It sounds as if you've all been going through a very difficult time recently. Although you say she hasn't had any treatment yet, just to reassure you the operation to remove the cancer and the lymph nodes is the major part of treatment.  If she is oestrogen positive and there's not indication that it's spread into her lymph nodes (ie if she's just had her sentinel lymph nodes removed) then normally it's 4 months + before she'd have radiotherapy to give her breast time to heal - and she wouldn't even have chemotherapy.  Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the 'belts and braces' in treating cancer to prevent reoccurance of it, but because she's recently had an MRI scan she hasn't got to the stage where she's 'ready' for their diagnosis of treatment yet by the sounds of it. Do you go to appointments with her?  Do you know what type of cancer she has? Have they confirmed whether it has spread to her lymph nodes? There is a breast cancer group for the under 50's on here which your sister may wish to join should she have any questions and for you obviously this group is great for advice and support and I see you've been recommended the friends and family group. I had breast cancer last year and one of the things that strikes me now is that a diagnosis of cancer automatically makes you think that you're going to 'die tomorrow' type thing.  BUT it's not like that I promise you, the treatments for breast cancer are so advanced and because it is SO prevalent, even since my having cancer some ladies are having different treatments which I would have had if they had been around at that time.  The research is immense and because of that so are the positive results.  In the 'olden days' all we seemed to hear about was 'so and so' passed away with breast cancer, but interestingly enough, having had breast cancer - I'm having facebook friends pop up and say things like \"I'm on my 20th year clear\" type thing - we only hear the worst, so we only fear the worst! Please calm yourself down as it's important for your sister that you remain positive and be able to support her through this.  It's hard going through the treatment, but she has everything to fight for and she will want her younger sister around to help her when she needs it, I'm sure. Do only use this site, breast cancer care uk , cancer research uk and NHS websites for your research - other sites are woefully out of date and some purport all sorts of stupid miracle claims with curing cancer.  They always make me chuckle to be honest because if they were true, then none of us would have cancer!  So, look at what is logical with regards to your sister's diagnosis and take one step at a time.  She will find out the results of her MRI and then take it from there as to what happens next - her oncology team will be looking after her really well.  I personally was amazed at how fantastic the treatment is within the NHS following a cancer diagnosis tbh. Kindest wishes,",

      "Content": "xcturner That's great advice from Grogg.  Your sister will no doubt have her own breast care nurse who she can get more information from and advice for counselling if she wants some. It's great that you are realising that you are thinking the worst when this might not actually be the case and that you aren't mentioning your fears to your sister. I just want to reassure you that her team hasn't made mistakes per se.  They will give their thoughts on what results they have in front of them and the mammogram/biopsies that were done at the outset and unfortunately, the further someone travels through their treatment, those results can and often do change.  So, when they did her initial tests, there appeared to be nothing showing in her lymph nodes and that's what they told her.  When they tested her sentinel lymph nodes they then discovered there was cancer in them, so they then removed the rest of them.  This is standard procedure and not a mistake, so you can trust in her medical team who are looking after her. Her cancer is ER+ (and maybe PR+) Oestrogen positive  - and this may or may not be due to her fertility treatment.  There is no rhyme or reason why some of us get cancer and some don't.  I've never had fertility treatment and I had ER+ cancer.  I was diagnosed on the cusp of menopause and as I'd had no HRT (another reason why some people can get ER+ breast cancer), then that wasn't the case either.  There are so many factors involved that it's pointless to worry about the why.   ER+ is one of the kinder types of breast cancer - for example, I didn't even need chemotherapy and I was 51 last year on diagnosis.  All other types it's pretty guaranteed that chemotherapy is part of the treatment.  She will be having tablets for 5 years - 10 years (tamoxifen, I expect) and because of it being in her lymph nodes, then likely to have chemotherapy. They are probably waiting for the results of the scans before they can confirm what her grade is and then they will decide on the next aspect of her treatment. I think perhaps this discussion may have shown you that a 'little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing'. At the start you had more or less figured that your sister is lost to you, but you can see that things are never that clear cut and EVEN IF there is spread to other areas of her body, it's not the end.  There are still treatments that can get her clear of cancer.   It's important for you, your Mum and more importantly, your sister to trust that her team know what they are doing  -and in all honesty, you can see how busy the 'breast group' is - her team have an awful lot of practice with dealing with breast cancer! and they DO know what they are doing. Try and be reassured by this and like you say, do your best to keep positive until Monday when you know what the next bit is that you are all having to deal with. The other thing to bear in mind is her age is also a positive.  I was in radiotherapy one day and a lady who was 86 had her radiotherapy before me.  Boy, did I feel sorry for this poor lady to have to deal with that at her age.  The older you are the less able you are to heal - so although your sister is very young she also is (apart from the cancer) young and far more healthy than others and therefore much more able to fight this disease.

My friend has just been signed off work for a fortnight  as her mum was diagnosed with breast cancer which has spread to the lymph nodes (but her mri on Thursday was confirmed as clear) and literally the following week her dad was rushed to coronary care with heart issues, just before he was discharged he was diagnosed with bladder cancer!  She seemed to be coping ok until she got in her car and couldn't remember how to drive. She went to her gp and he just said \"how long do you want off work?\". Apart from taking her mum and dad to respective appointments, she is going to swimming and reflexology. I think perhaps if you look at some of the things that ladies in the breast cancer group do to calm themselves down, maybe you try a few of these techniques? Try a mindfulness app or something.  I personally play a word anagram game to make sure that I relax (as I have always worked at 100mph and didn't know how to just 'relax and switch off ) - can't do mindfulness apps as I get distracted too easily  but you may find them useful for you to try and cope with all this.

For you, it's made worse because of your sibling having cancer as well I guess? I actually have looked at my blood test results when I was diagnosed with BC and a previous time when I was diagnosed with MRSA in a wound in my leg.  The blood tests were normal when I was diagnosed with BC, not so when I had MRSA -I was on strong antibiotics and my kidney readings were poor (most likely caused by the antibiotics) and my white blood cells were raised indicating infection.  I guess based on that, if the cancer is in the bowel, prostate, organs etc then the bloods tell a story, so for breast cancer the best check is presumably a mammogram.  Mine hadn't spread to my lymph nodes though, so it might be a question to Ask the Nurse as to whether a spread from previous BC would show up on blood tests. Unless someone else answers and knows whether it would show. If they did blood tests, by that time does it mean that it's already spread? and no different from if we were beginning to feel unwell?   I think perhaps blood tests would be deemed as a 'peace of mind' test because after our treatment they confirm that we have no cancer and there are many ladies I know who had cancer and have been cancer free for many, many years (including a 94 year old who had it over 30 years ago!)

      "Content": "Hi Kenla210 I have been through a different process from you (age 51) - no chemo - I was diagnosed with ER+ tumour (13mm) and 4.5cm of DCIS in June 2017 in my left breast. I had my operation on 26th July in day surgery.  I was moved to the end of the list as due to a road accident in 1983, I had a cut on my leg June 2016 which was MRSA positive and still positive by the time I was due to have my operation - so they wanted me last into theatre.  I am 38D size bra.  I had an 8cm lumpectomy (which turned out to be a 15mm grade 2 tumour) and Sentinel node removal.  I had 2 wires put in place (one for the DCIS and one for the tumour) during the day and went to theatre at 4.15pm.  I was collected to go home at 7.30pm and I felt tender but otherwise just a bit wiped out.  100% I needed my new bra on!  I bought  post surgery bras from M&S and they were a Godsend - my other bras would no way have supported me.  I ended up buying more of them as I personally needed to wear my bra overnight for a fortnight as my left breast felt so 'heavy' that I was waking up when I tried not to wear it overnight - each time I rolled over in bed it obviously hurt too much and woke me up and it hurt lying on my back as well. Friday 28th July, I was still tender and a still a little tired, but as I hadn't told my young niece about my diagnosis (I didn't want to upset her as she is only 11) and she came to visit me to work with me in my studio on the Friday, I played it down and pretended I'd had a bit of a shoulder op.  We were working together quite happily in my studio (I'm a self employed silversmith) for over 4 hours and she forgot I was 'injured' as it didn't cause me any problems - I just lifted things one thing at a time - e.g. a pile of heavy books we were looking through. She came back and worked with me for 5 hours on the Sunday too. I also work part time employed and I had booked the Thursday 27th off work and don't normally work employed on the Friday.  My boss had arranged for me to have taxis to and from work (I work in the sticks!) from the Monday for a further week.  By Sunday, I rang and cancelled the taxis and happily drove the 8 miles to and from work on the Monday 31st July with no problem whatsoever.  The same road accident in 1983 meant I had my right elbow removed, so it is completely fixed and this means that I realistically only have one arm to use (I can't rotate my right hand as this movement is linked to the elbow and can't bend the elbow to do anything like taking my hand to my mouth (eating, drinking - pouring a kettle needs rotation etc). Because of this, I had no alternative BUT to use my left arm ( being the one where they had removed the sentinel nodes/ side of the lumpectomy ) from the moment I had had the operation.  I had the BC nurse ring the following day after surgery and I asked her how much should I be doing due to my right arm problem and she said that I should be getting someone else to help me to avoid using my left arm - what part of \"I have just used my left arm to answer the telephone to her because I couldn't physically use my right arm!\" did she not get?  ha, ha, However, I also read that you shouldn't over protect your 'bad arm' and when I did the exercises, they were absolutely 'nothing' - I did them as one of the early ones reaching upwards did stretch it a little more BUT I had been doing LOADS more than these exercises as I had absolutely no choice whatsoever.  Because of this, by the second week of exercises, I gave up with them as they were pointless for me and I was doing everything normally  APART from lifting more than 1kg,I was even doing a jewellery show on Thursday 3rd August and drove 25 miles there and 25 mile back, serving customers, demonstrating etc and wasn't in the least bit tired. After the fortnight when I felt my breast wasn't so tender (ie when I stopped wearing my bra in bed), I got my bicycle out and was back to exercising. I did find my right shoulder was a little stiffer - so do exercises with your opposite arm as well.  I'm not sure why it should affect my right arm, but it might have been because I normally sleep on my left side and due to the operation had to learn to sleep on my (previously) bad right arm.  I did have an extra pillow in bed for the fortnight as well as this seemed to help. I still find that I don't lift as heavy weights now - carrying a suitcase, I move to my other arm as sometimes it does feel like it pulls a bit, so I'm being sensible.  I think you will know your own body - if it stretches, it's ok.  If it hurts then stop.  I took ibuprofen for the whole fortnight (to reduce swelling), but only used paracetamol for about 3 days. Don't know if it made any difference (the ibuprofen), but it made sense to me to do it. Hope this helps and just do what your body allows you to do (rather what your husband tells you you can't do!) - by the sound of it you will anyway ;) ",

      "Content": "Hi Booth1986 sorry, realised that I put one of the responder's names in my post (rather than yours!) Each hospital is different, I was told by breast surgeon \"lumpectomy and 3 weeks radiation\",  The BC nurse didn't want to discuss radiotherapy at that point.  I think until the main sentinel nodes are removed during the operation, they can't 100% guarantee that the cancer hasn't spread.  But they were clearly pretty sure, based on what the breast surgeon told me,  No-one told me until the appointment, a fortnight after my operation that my lymph nodes were clear - but I remember them checking out under my arm during the original biopsies and the doctor saying \"no lumps\".  That, and the ultrasound scans show where the cancer/DCIS is; so they are almost guaranteed to be right - but no-one could ever say until the nodes are looked at in pathology. It would be worth you asking what type of cancer you have.  It will depend on the type of tablets you will take (as well as your age), if you are to have tablets etc.  ER+ is the most common one and as such seems to be the easiest to treat as if it's not spread, no chemo - phew!  If you're aged 31 as I suspect, pre-menopausal, you may be put on Tamoxifen if ER+, but maybe not if it's stage 0 (DCIS).  I was put on tablets because I was stage 1 (invasive), but I met another couple of ladies in radio who were DCIS only and prescribed tablets. I finished 3 weeks ago tomorrow and tbh it feels like it was all a dream - if I didn't have the scar, I wouldn't have believed that I'd had an invasive cancer this summer. (still went out every weekend, went to the gym, only had 1 day off work sick etc) - just surreal really!  As long as you can control your thoughts, then it isn't that hard to get through.   The fear of the unknown was so, so, much worse than going through it. x",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I've not been on this thread before but I love Leolady56's title for it and I must admit to being inspired to do a bit more walking because of seeing this pop up on the group every single day.... Bit of history (I'll keep it brief).  When I was 17 I had a major road accident and was told there was a 1 in a million chance of keeping my leg - they managed it - 2 years in a wheelchair and at 21 had my final operation to fix my ankle into a better walking position.  (I actually took up horse riding at 30 and this made such a difference).  I can walk, but not far.  I was diagnosed with BC last year and unlike many of you poor ladies, I didn't suffer any fatigue from operation or radio. I thank my lucky stars I didn't have to have chemo and I constantly feel for you ladies that have to go through it.   I joined a gym as I figured exercise, food etc was the way to go to improve mind and body.  I had a go on the walking machine - and realised it was strengthening my leg.  So, I've been doing some walking out and about now, not taking the car when I once would have done.  Most days I can do 6000+ steps - and sometimes even 10,000 - might not be a lot for some, but it is a huge amount for me with a dodgy leg ;).  When I'm walking, I think of Lindsey's thread. On Monday, it struck me that this IS walking back to happiness! I had my first annual mammogram Monday and the doctor looked at my scans immediately and told me they \"looked good\" ..(so for other ladies that have to wait a fortnight - try asking if the doctor will look at results straight away - you never know!! ). I've done as Lindsey has suggested in her post and aided by an improved diet I  have and will continue to 'walk back to happiness'.   All the best to everyone who participates in this thread on an ongoing basis. (I have a couple of jobs, so can't get involved as much as I would like in threads such as this one).",

      "Content": "Hello kathleen37 A warm welcome from me too, to this very supportive site with a lot of knowledgeable ladies and gents. You sound a very positive person which is great.  I think it is a good idea to print off the NHS stuff to try and get your own head around things before you get your biopsy results.  It could be nothing, but equally as they say they are very experienced to see what cancer looks like.  When I had my tests, I was 100% prepared for the biopsy results to be cancer when I met the breast surgeon.  The waiting is the worst bit because it's all 'what if's?' at the moment for you isn't it? You've had an extremely stressful and emotional time of it recently haven't you? And this is another blow for you.  I'm sorry to hear how much you are having to go through. There are 4 main sites I would recommend if you want further information.  Macmillan (obviously), Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Care.org.uk and NHS.  You will see that there are many different types of breast cancer and you can get yourself a bit lost with all the types, so try not to think too much about types at this moment as this would be confirmed by biopsy results - treatment plans always depend on the type and stage of a cancer.  Equally you could be one of those that it turns out to be nothing for you....and wouldn't that be amazing? If it's any help to understand your follow up appointment for the results, mine was a meeting with the surgeon who told me I had cancer (you often see the breast surgeon whether you had cancer or not).  Then she looked to see if she could carry out a lumpectormy (wide local excision [WLE]) or a mastectomy and gave a rough idea of the treatment plan.  (it could only be rough until surgery confirms what they think and sometimes it can change). I was then passed over to a Macmillan breast care nurse, who provided me with the breast cancer care binder - absolutely brilliant binder: loads of information in it.   She ticked the type of cancer I had (I would never have remembered/understood if she hadn't) and then booked my appointment for day surgery for a WLE and sentinel node biopsy [SNB]. It may be worth taking someone with you, so that you can get them to remember things that are said as well as for support. I never felt ill once, which is what is so odd about being told you have cancer when you feel 100% perfectly fit!   p.s. one of our Community Champions is from Australia, so no boundaries on who can join the community! Fingers crossed that the radiologist was wrong and it turns out to be nothing for you, but if it does, then you will be benefiting from the the advances in treatment of breast cancer which is happening constantly and the number of us using this site is testament to this - then at that point is the time to be organising care for your Mum (the Macmillan BC nurse is the first one to tell).... but take one step at a time and it will be a lot more manageable.  Kindest wishes,",

My 'stretch marks' are easing off as I've been using bio oil on them.  The really hot weather was making it worse on top of this and found it was itching as well. Obviously can't say this is same for you, but I had my clear annual mammogram in June, so it makes sense to me that I have to protect my breast and not lift anything heavy on that side/ put too much pressure on it.  I'm not sure how long it's supposed to be before we can use the arm normally, if ever but to avoid the swelling, I'm quite happy not to do too much lifting.  I found this link on Ask about radiotherapy which might also be of interest ",

      "Content": "Hi Jediknight I'm on Anastrozole and yes, I do believe the side effects can hit very quickly with different brands. I was initially prescribed Accord and only get rare stiffness with these which might be down to normal aches and pains as we get older (plus I had a bad road accident when I was 17 and if I do too much my joints can ache).  One month I was given a different brand and within 2 days - boy did I notice the difference!  So, as I had some Accord left I changed to Accord and lo and behold within a day or so, I was fine.  So, to test my theory, I took the other brand after 3 days and 'bang' 2 days later - stiffness in my joints.   From that, I wrote to my Doctors and he now has \"Accord Brand Only\" on my prescription slip and I won't touch another brand again. Having 'tested' the other tablets I am convinced that a couple of days is enough to kick in the side effects.  As you've had problems with the Accord previously, then if it was me, I would go back to the brand that you've been fine on as the 2 days of Accord fits with my testing of the other brand I was on - 2-3 days on them and it hit.

I wonder if you could ring the breast clinic and let them know how hard you are finding it with waiting and see if you could get a cancellation appointment?  I can remember at mine that although they didn't say 'you have cancer' the amount of tests, biopsies and the nurses words \"we are very concerned about' following my first ever mammogram and a callback to the clinic. I knew I had cancer, but even then it was still a couple of weeks following that before I had an appointment with the breast surgeon at my local hospital.  So, it could be up to 7 weeks before you get a definitive answer.  (They refer you to the breast surgeon whether good or bad). Even IF it is cancer, please be reassured that the diagnosis and treatment is never as bad as your imagination.  Sounds stupid, but I think everyone believes that the not knowing is the hardest.  Once you know what it is and treatment starts then everything becomes a little easier to cope with - and I sincerely hope that for you, it's nothing and we won't see you on the site again  - in the nicest way possible of course!!! Also, even IF it does turn out to be cancer, please don't worry that the delay will make a huge difference to the outcome.  Give them a call and see if they can squeeze you in earlier to put your mind at rest.

      "Content": "Hellokittykat - a warm welcome, but sorry that you are here with us.   I have just read this thread and I see you've been directed to more information from LexiT7 and I thought I'd add a little more. DCIS is non invasive cancer and invasive cancer is where the cells have broken out of the ducts and spread to surrounding tissue.  Having tested 3 sentinel lymph nodes and 2 of them having come back positive then yes, it is invasive cancer but please don't think that 'all is lost!'.  The lymphatic system is there as a PROTECTOR of your body by 'catching' the cancer in them and it is in 2 out of the 3, rather than all 3.  They will want to do a CT scan and this is normal.  Sometimes DCIS can stay dormant and may become nothing - not sure many people would want to take that gamble..... but sometimes it does become invasive cancer.  In some instances (like mine), the DCIS can be completely different from the invasive cancer.  I had 2 areas totalling 54mm of DCIS grade 3 ER-PR- and then a tumour of 15mm grade 2 Invasive ductal carcinoma ER+ PR+. Mine hadn't spread to the lymph nodes, so I didn't need chemotherapy.  So, they will be finding out what type of cancer you have in your lymph nodes and confirming your DCIS and other findings.  They may well want to remove all your lymph nodes and I strongly suspect you will be offered chemotherapy (depending on your age - my friend's Mother was 80 at diagnosis with spread to lymph nodes and although fit, they obviously felt that the negatives of chemo outweighed the benefits) but you won't know their plan for you until the pathology comes back with your results which may be a couple of weeks.  Hold onto the fact that only 2 of the 3 lymph nodes were positive and hopefully no more will come back positive, in which case it could still be pretty early stages and you've caught it in plenty of time.   Be kind to yourself and focus on the now.  A mastectomy is a big operation and you need to come to terms with all that you have been through and recover your health.  The waiting for the results will be a very difficult time (everyone says this - the waiting is the hardest part - once you know what you're dealing with it becomes a lot easier). It seems to be that our imaginations run wild and we always think the worst.  One thing that really helped me was something I heard:  Imagine the worst and imagine the best outcomes.  Then settle your mind on the middle ground and you never know it could actually end up being the best scenario!  The treatments for breast cancer are progressing so quickly and advances are constantly being made.  I was diagnosed in 2017 and within a year, new treatments were being offered which weren't available to me. Keep posting on this site with any questions you have or just chatting to keep your spirits up! There is an AWAKE thread where other ladies struggle to sleep and keep each other going during the night, but most of all you'll find many, many ladies who've been where you are  and have got to the other side and able to offer support and a great deal of knowledge.

I had scared myself silly with all the potential side effect that we have to sign for (heart problems, ribs etc etc), but you can see in my profile image me ringing the bell after my 15 sessions  The lady that took it was waiting for her first session and was in floods of tears taking the picture because I was so well and it reassured her that it was a relatively easy process. She gave me a huge hug because she'd been so frightened and to see that I was perfectly healthy.  I'm amazed that the picture was in focus she was blubbing so much tbh! There are some sessions when they take images, so these sessions take a little longer and I had one session where they just couldn't get me lined up properly.  They stopped and started about 6 times, but I just kept thanking them for being so precise.  I figured I didn't want to get them flustered and rush it into making mistakes, so I was grateful that they were doing their job so well. Once they've positioned you at your first ever appointment, I gather they have a computer file which is programmed into the machines.  I only sussed this because one of the machines broke down midway on one lady and she had to wait for the other files which had been loaded in the other machine to be cleared before she could have hers loaded.   Main thing is drink loads.  You can't drink enough - I drank pints and pints and pints and I didn't have any fatigue, despite the 60 mile journey daily - I drove myself every day and I was also still working for my employer.  And I creamed a lot.  In hindsight to prevent burns under my breast I would have just creamed at night there because this is the only place I was burned and I am sure it was because my bra band was rubbing.  But other than that I was putting cream on 4 x a day - all around, even to my armpit. I noticed that the top of my inside arm darkened slightly in colour too at the end of my treatment, so the beams can get there as well . Good luck with it all,",

      "Content": "Hi Winky49  Sorry to hear the troubles you are experiencing at work.  I am convinced the girls in your office don't understand cancer and the effects it has on (a) the mind (b) the body.  When I was younger  - many years ago a staff member who had had brain cancer was transferred into my office and the canteen area had a section for smokers.  She asked the manager to ban smoking as it was affecting her.  He told her to eat her lunch at her desk and not bother going to the kitchen area.  Absolutely shocking when you read it - but at the time, I was in my 20's/30's and didn't think anything of it AT ALL! Another lady was going through the menopause and every now and again we'd come across her looking bright red in the face and fanning herself - again we paid no attention. From these 2 stories, it perhaps just shows that it is ignorance not maliciousness that is probably causing the issue for you.  Years later, I became the manager of this office and I would always try and look at both sides of any argument if there was any dispute. 1) you need to be cool due to the menopause symptoms being caused by the tamoxifen  - 1 person 2) the other staff are complaining about the cold - 4 people Whether your symptoms are brought on by cancer or the normal menopause, then the situation is just the same.  What have the company done as whole for ladies with the menopause? Have you any ideas that you can suggest?  From your point of view - do you enjoy your job? do you want to leave? do you want to create an 'atmosphere' with your colleagues? Leolady56 has put in some sound advice earlier regarding the soft approach. From your above comment  'I used to be friendly with one of them but she stabbed me in the back by saying she has had to make compromises for me\" and that you now play your radio and don't interact with the rest of the office.  I know once you feel 'wronged' by people it is hard to like them again - but if you can look at any situation from both sides.  You were probably off work with your breast cancer for a while and your colleagues covered, what compromises did she mean? Did she mean that she had to take on a bit of extra work? In that case she is probably correct in what she said.... do you understand where I am trying to come from?  I was feeling so vulnerable with my breast cancer when I was diagnosed last year, that anything anyone said that might have gone over my head previously, would be deemed an attack.   At the moment, you are experiencing side effects, have had cancer and are older than the others in your office - none of these they understand.  Are they really 'horrible' girls? or before all this, did you enjoy their company and being youngsters, did they keep you young?  Office relationships are harder work than your own husband/partner!  You spend more time with them.  Can you discuss the situation with them and explain how you feel?  I am sure they would be horrified to feel that they have made you feel ostracised.  (Going back to the lady who'd had brain cancer when I was in my 20's/early 30's - I hasten to add that I didn't know her at all well as it was a huge office and she was 20+ years older than me, but it has really stuck in my mind for the last 10 years when I heard that she had passed away - she never spoke to me about the manager's decision and I only found out after she had gone back to her old office BUT if she had mentioned in a chat to me that she felt ostracised and explained more of what she had been through, I know I would have not just ignored the fact that this poor lady was eating her lunch at her desk).  Can you ask them for suggestions?  Rather than you being ostracised to another room and missing out on their company say that you would like to be with them. They will take that as a compliment, I am sure. At the same time, understanding that for them there is nothing worse than being too cold (even though when you're hot /having a hot flush you'd love nothing better!!!).  Asking them the question may make them think more about your situation and how would they feel if they were in your position?- add in any ideas  that you have to resolve the situation. This is by no means saying take away the onus from your employer to provide a better solution than sticking you in an office on your own! They may have a great idea at HR dept.   However, if you want to maintain relations with the people you work with, then asking them as a friend and colleague might actually resolve the situation for all of you-  plus improve things as it sounds from your above post that you have lost the close working relationship with them which is very sad in itself.",

      "Content": "Hi Purplemarriane  Really pleased that you've gone from 'lurking' to posting if it helps you to get your feelings out there...  I can totally get the scream as I can remember thinking exactly the same!  I am with a partner (for last 3 years), no children, brother miles away and parents gone - so just me and my OH.  He carried on as if nothing was any different, talking about his work, expecting me to still do his accounts, what shall we do this weekend? type thing. I know it would have been a 100% different story if he'd been diagnosed with cancer! I had a couple of 'mini meltdowns' where I thought \"that's it, I'm going to die and nobody else seems to notice that anything has changed\", but since those 2 times (right at the start of my diagnosis), I've just more or less accepted that although it is cancer - it's actually just another illness to be dealt with. Looking at it this way makes it far less 'threatening'.  There have been so many advances in cancer treatment that it really is different these days - I was stunned that I was able to go home 2 hours after having 8cm chopped out of my breast!   And this site was a major help, like you say in just knowing that other people are going through the same thing and totally understand.   I'm guessing you are the one who's always there to support, which is why you still are supporting. If you need to have a rest from it then do so, even if you feel you are pulled from pillar to post! I had my last appointment with my breast nurse a month ago and I was up to my eyes with stress .  Only 4 months after finishing radiotherapy, my boob is still swollen, still got the green dye etc. My OH had gone into the VAT threshold and despite me saying 10 times that very morning that I was not going to be able to continue to do his accounts as I work part time employed and run my own business as well (so about  35 - 45 hours work a week). He kept asking and kept telling me 'how easy it would be' - yeah right! so easy, do it yourself then.....Once upon a time, I would have done them, but now I am looking after myself better and other ladies I've spoken to after their treatments have also said that they are now being less 'giving in' to others who always expect them to be the ones to shoulder everything.  It teaches you that actually just once in a while WE are important to look after. My breast nurse gave me details of a mindfulness app.  Headspace - I googled it and just downloaded it on my phone - it's free to use and just for 3 minutes (if you want just 3 minutes), you relax and it really does make a difference.  I've always run around at 500mph this app is a nice way to just completely stop. Good luck on the 4th, I'll be thinking of you and let us know how you get on.",

My Mum died in 2014 and my Dad died 3 months before I was diagnosed.  I do believe stress is a major factor, hence trying to focus on reducing stress levels. Once you have the operation, you'll have to ease back a bit.  I don't know about a lumpectomy in the armpit as mine was my breast, but I can imagine you will have a similar plan of rest and exercises to do.  I was told not to lift more than 1kg with my at risk arm - you'll be surprised how much you use it normally.  So picking up the laundry bin, will be out (for instance).  When you've had your op, I would recommend that you actually tell your family that you need help and accept it (despite being the care giver) as it might actually do them good and help them to concentrate on you instead of their problems? And when you get to the mentality later of realising that you need to look after yourself as well, then it will come naturally for them.  Be too strong throughout and they will be like my OH and think 'that's it then, I don't need to do anything!' Even though you will be able to do all sorts of things (I was at the gym the day after finishing radiotherapy), you will be surprised how long your body does need to recover..",

Another thing to realise is that only last year the Oncotype DX test wasn't even offered to many as it was so new then.  So for me, I didn't have to make a decision at all - straight to radio and hormone tablets for 5 years.   Who knows if a retrospective test would be available, but I wouldn't want it and I  have been through my first year with NED (no evidence of disease) at my mammogram in June and I would have hated having to make the decision you have - I was so, so relieved that I didn't need chemo.   As others have said will the risks of chemo outweigh the benefits?  I had a friend diagnosed a month after me in July 17 and she had chemo as HER2.  I had one day off work for a much larger tumor and a bigger operation (as a lot of DCIS too) in comparison to her and she went back to work last month on a phased return after a whole year off.  What a difference it makes to your recovery having or not having chemotherapy!   Best wishes with your decision.",

      "Content": "Hi Helsjw Try not to worry about the delay as it really isn't an issue.  The surgery you had removed all the cancer and the radiotherapy is just 'belt and braces' to prevent it coming back.  Easy to say 'don't worry', I know, but it really is the case.  Your breast has to recover a bit from the operation before it gets the radiotherapy beams. My lumpectomy operation was July 2017 for ER+ IDC 15mm grade 2 ( plus 54mm of DCIS grade 3 ER-), and I didn't start radiotherapy until the end of September 2017.  During the 15 sessions I had, there were a couple of days that were missed due to machine breakages which were tagged on at the end and these didn't matter either - just in case this happens to you too.  In actual fact, it was nicer because it gave my breast a bit of an opportunity to recover for the odd days.   My original diagnosis was early June 2017 and I had my 'annual' mammogram in June 2018, so in reality only 8 months from finishing treatment - and it came back  completely clear.  I was put on the tablets for ER+ when I first saw my oncologist in August 2017, so the same as you, being on the tablets before starting radio. Before radiotherapy each day, I did a 20 minute DVD exercise routine (as they say exercise is important to prevent fatigue) and I drunk loads and loads and loads of fluids.  One lady I met had really bad fatigue, but she really wasn't drinking much at all.  I put on my creams first thing in the morning (all up the inside of the top of my arm to under my armpit too - this went dark, so I think it was zapped!), an hour before radio, straight after radio as I got changed and overnight.  My one lesson learned was that in the 3rd week I wouldn't have creamed underneath my breast 4 x a day, but just overnight.  The bra band rubbed and this was the only area I got radio burns.  I carried on for a week and a half afterwards - used up the remaining cream I'd bought.  Last month I felt (so a year since radio) that my breast has totally returned to normal (well my new normal - a 3\" scar and a huge dent), but I can now lift heavy shopping bags without it swelling and turning red.  So it does go to show that radiotherapy continues working for a long time after it has finished and your breast isn't like a bone breakage (for instance) and takes an awful long time to heal. I hope it all goes well for all you ladies  Kindest wishes,",

(plus postage x 2 when I ordered the third pot), but it did the trick and I suspect any form of gel/cream will be ok.  I think the nearest match would be the Holland &Barret aloe vera gel ,to the one I used at a fraction of the cost!  I don't know about aveeno, other ladies may have used it and found it ok for them, but mine was definitely a gel, rather than a cream. I used soap without any additives or anything.  But, I wonder if this would be ok for you.... bit of an explanation....  Before I was even diagnosed with breast cancer, I had had an MRSA infection for a year in my leg (major road accident at 17 where I lost most of the skin, so my shin is practically all scar tissue).  I had recovered from cancer and STILL getting nowhere with the doctors over the MRSA infection and finally managed to get a referral to the specialist hospital who originally carried out my grafts.  The plastic surgeon there recommended I use Badedas shower gel on my leg - and.... within 2 months it had healed!  2 years and 4 months after originally getting the infection, it healed!  Reading the contents of Badedas, it's all plant based - and I use it all the time now (obviously), so it clearly has some good properties in it.  When you go to your radiotherapy session, it could be worth asking them if they would feel it would be ok for you. When I say I drank loads - I drank pints throughout the day (I drink a lot normally so it was no hardship), but I also treated myself to a large coffee from the coffee shop after each session for the drive home too I am sure you will be find being fit and active will help you a great deal to avoid fatigue, so that's great news. (I also think that stress would play a part with fatigue as the girl who was struggling was worrying about her finances as well as she'd only just started her new job).

Yes, this sounds completely normal (except for the atrocious appointment keeping).  The mammogram and ultrasound and biopsies are what I had and at the time of the biopsies they inserted 2 clips.  These clips denote where (if it turns out to be cancerous) the surgeon will aim to remove the lump/pre-cancerous cells.  The biopsies will be determining (I assume) if it is cancerous or benign.  I wasn't asked to complete a form and my next appointment was with the breast surgeon in a further 2 weeks.  This appointment with the breast surgeon is standard practice whether it is cancerous or not.  The appointment being the next day, may well be because you weren't on their list and they want to discuss things more fully with you?My first appointment had a meeting with a nurse to discuss how I was feeling before and after all the tests and perhaps they missed all this out with you which is why you are being asked back the next day.   I hope everything turns out to be perfectly alright for you - I suspect it will be a week or 2 before you get the results of the biopsies and this is the worst time - the waiting.  Just pop on here any time you like and ask any questions as we hope you won't be with us long, but we are here to help your journey be a little easier.

These machines are used consistently from early in the morning until late at night (at the hospital I went to) and it didn't surprise me that they broke down every now and again.  They had several machines where I was, but within their timetable, were service days for the machines.  I actually had one day cancelled in between due to breakdown and another couple of days out here and there for services.  It meant it took longer but I was grateful as it meant more recovery time for my skin and hopefully less side effects as I was getting little breaks during the week. As you will be starting on the Wednesday (hopefully), rather than Tuesday - 3 days, then 2 days rest for your skin.  That's how I looked at it when i had cancelled appointments - who knows if it made any difference, but  I only had a small amount of blistering from radio and no side effects at all.",

      "Content": "Hi Raggarty I guess no-one can give you the reassurance that you want and to calm your nerves, but wanted to pop on and wish you the very best of luck for tomorrow. When I went for my first ever mammogram, I read all the literature and it said that being my first one it might be that 'they don't know your breasts so it isn't unusual to get a callback\" so having had a red mark by my nipple and a couple of raised areas on my right breast for many years, I wasn't in the least bit concerned when I got a letter saying to attend the breast clinic.  When I got there, they started discussing my LEFT breast and said they were \"very concerned by what they had found\" and proceeded to do all the tests and biopsies etc.  I knew then that I had cancer in my left breast before I even saw the breast surgeon.  I was \"only\" ER+ for the tumor and ER/PR- for the 2 areas of DCIS, so didn't have chemo.  On Friday I had the results of my 2 year annual and it was fine.  But my right breast still has the red mark and the odd raised areas on my nipple.   My left breast has settled into a strange shape (I had 8cm removed), but some days it still hurts and my bra can feel tight , the nipple does change - but not a pronounced change such as you are describing. Whenever I am asked if there are any changes that I've noticed, I always say that I haven't a clue as I really don't know what the heck I would be looking for in it. I didn't even know there was a problem in the first place, so how I would know now it's all misshapen and a random shape - Heaven only knows how we are supposed to check. I guess what I'm trying to say is I didn't have as much treatment as you but take the tablets and had radiation and even they do seem to affect my breast shape, swelling, dull aches every now and again 2 years down the line. I wonder if it is caused by the AI's, so I sincerely hope that the changes you have are down to your treatment and will keep my fingers very firmly crossed for you tomorrow. Kindest wishes,",

So, whether it's just cysts or not, they are making sure that you're being looked after properly by referring you to the breast cancer clinic. I suspect you will have a mammogram, maybe an ultrasound and perhaps biopsies.  I'd been recalled from my first ever mammogram and hadn't bothered about the appointment in the slightest - thinking that it was just 'cause they didn't know my breasts.  Was quite a shock when they said they 'had concerns'.  I went on my own and I'm glad I did, but only because my OH is totally useless with his support.  If your partner is the supportive kind, then I would say, yes take them with you.  The whole thing took about 2 hours, into one room for this, next room for that, then another room for the other etc - so constantly in and out, but very well looked after by the team of doctors and nurses. Fingers crossed that the lumps turn out to be absolutely nothing for you, but don't forget we are here to support as well.",

If it is of any comfort to you, advances are being made day in day out with cancer treatments.  If I had had breast cancer a few decades ago, I am sure it would have been a different story for me (not spread, but 8cm of cancer).  I just had a lumpectomy, within 2 hours of the operation I was home and had radiotherapy later - and only had one day off work!   My sister in law had stage 3 breast cancer which had spread to her chest wall.  She was in her 50's when diagnosed (had a heart condition previously and was extremely overweight as well, had arthritis and no exercise etc.) . She died in 2014 at nearly 70 years of age. Your sister is naturally younger and probably a lot fitter than my sister in law, so she has age and health on her side.  As you say it is not curable but treatable and people can live for many, many years with cancer.  She will have a pack given to her which will have a lot of advice - healthy eating and exercise seems to be a big key to fighting cancer and maintaining good health. Having your support will mean the world to her too, I'm sure. Thinking of you both",

I can imagine how worried you must be feeling, but try and be reassured that you are being seen by the experts.  Yes, the thought that it might be cancer is terrifying, but equally it also might not be!  Lumps and bumps can often be cysts or other things that are nothing to do with cancer and cousin's aren't too close to you genetically, ie - not your direct blood relatives, so don't read too much into the fact they have had breast cancer. With regards what to expect at the referral.  They might just do a mammogram (and I personally found this a doddle) - squash your breast into a machine - a little uncomfortable but that's about it (for me - others find it painful) but the better images can be obtained the more they are able to 'squash' if that makes sense. They may do an ultrasound scan and they may take biopsies.  The numb the area so I can't recall feeling any pain with this either.  I went for my tests on my own and I felt perfectly ok to drive the 30+ miles back home after my tests. If and only IF it is cancer - be very reassured that it is not the end of the world.  I can say this having been through it and I actually only had one day off work (I didn't need chemotherapy and it was early stages, so it's not always necessary).  I think we hear the word cancer and automatically we feel as if we're going to \"shuffle off this mortal coil \" but with the advances that have been happening over the years, I was stunned that (a) everything/everyone is SO efficient  when dealing with it (b) it wasn't as bad as I dreaded. The fear and the waiting / our imagination is far worse than the actual and most ladies will say that the worst time for them was the not knowing.  Good luck on Wednesday and hopefully we won't see you back here again ;) but even if you are, just know that we are all here and many of us have come out the other side stronger than before.",

Try and look at a positive side - I was happy when the machine had a service mid week /or it broke down (it did it on one lady in the middle of the treatment and they had to carry on with the ones they had already got programmed on the other machine before they could do her, bless her).  But I saw it as a break for my skin and I had 3 weeks with odd days out here and there in those 3 weeks - and had very little in the way of blistering.  I'm sure the odd breaks helped even though it took a bit longer out of the month.  Best wishes,",

The breast nurse said \"you are in the early days\"  I was stunned!  nearly 5 months after finishing radiotherapy I didn't think was early days.....It most definitely is apparently - the radiotherapy will continue to have an effect for a very long time afterwards and I needn't worry that I will never be able to use my at risk arm properly once sufficient time has passed.  She couldn't tell me how long, just that I need to listen to my body and I will know when I've done too much.

Hi ArgyMargy, - I joined this forum in July, just after my lumpectomy and I saw so many posts like yours where people were supported by their loved ones and friends, that I was beginning to think that I was 'on my own'.  My Mum, would have been 100% there for me, I know and that would have been all I would have needed - I have missed her every day since 19th June 2014 when they asked me to agree to switch her life support off; but just some days driving back from radio, it hit me 'in the stomach' just how much we were there for each other, no matter who else let us down and I found myself grieving for her as bad as the first day.  My Dad went last year and he had dementia caused by the stroke, but he still would have been better than some of my so called friends and family!   Really pleased that you have support :) and although I don't feel quite so alone in the way people have reacted: Hugs and support to those of you who have found themselves in a similar position to me and  I'm sorry that you have xx",

I feel as if the next words out of any medical person's mouth will be 'just do as your told' when I ask any question.  I  also wonder if you and I appear 'too strong' to family and friends, so no-one bothers to even remember that we might just need support sometimes?  I wouldn't want people to be saying \"oh woe is you\" type thing, but just ONE person who I've supported through thick and thin to ask just once how I'm feeling would be nice ;) and even more importantly try and bother remembering that I've been ill..  Another rather nasty co-incidence with you Boobybird, is that my Mum died from sepsis in 2014. Not the whole reason as mostly it was  caused by hospital errors in not diagnosing it/then overdosing her on 2 separate drugs (legal case ongoing).  When Mum died, I became my Dad's legal guardian (financial and health) as he was level 3 disabled following a stroke in 2009. I had been Mum's support carer for him. So we have a similar history there too. So sorry to hear you've had such a rubbish time of it tooxx  It's good to know that there is someone who 'gets it' - even though I wish you weren't in the same position.  It makes me feel like 'everyone else's life is deemed far more important than my inconsequential one'. mrsox Sounds like it's your BCN is as 'helpful' as mine..Sorry to hear that.  You and choloecat45 are right - don't worry about people who don't want to understand.  I am so thankful that Macmillan have this resource for us and the good BC nurses that they put in many hospitals.  I don't want to become an 'embittered woman' as that will do no good for my future health, but just writing it down once helps.  I guess, I need to just get on with  life, albeit with a wonky boob! - and hope it doesn't come back. Those people who don't even think about anyone else but themselves may well have been responsible for support by donating to Macmillan / Breastcare / Cancer research (I hope so!) and at least are supporting cancer patients that way.  ",

There are apps for your phone for mindfulness which I would thoroughly recommend you try as you can listen to these whilst you look after yourself and build your mental strength for the time ahead.

      "Content": "-Hi, I just wondered if anyone else has experienced a lack of 'support' from nearly everyone (bar 1 or 2), including doctors and BC Nurse?  I read so much on here where people say \"my husband's amazing support\", \"my oncologist is amazing\" \"I couldn't get through this without.... such and such....\" etc Age 51 Stage 1 Grade 2 - 1.5cm tumour, 4.5cm DCIS lumpectomy My surgeon was foreign very difficult to understand him -  I saw him for the first time whilst waiting to go to theatre in July this year.  He told me I would end up with a dent in my breast - first time this had been suggested to me.  I saw him again with the results of the sentinel lymph nodes, then quickly over to the BC nurse.  My BC nurse was interrupted during the appointment to book surgery immediately after I had just been told by a breast surgeon that I had cancer and would be operated on 'but I won't be doing the operation'.  My BC nurse and the other nurse had a long discussion to sort out their paperwork before getting home as the appointments were running 1 1/2 hour late. Meanwhile my other half's phone rang during the appointment (twice!) and he left the room to answer it.   The next time I saw the BC nurse I asked her a basic question and she told me to ask the oncologist. She telephoned the day after my surgery and \"just ringing to check on you following the operation, do you have any questions?\" I asked limit of weight I could carry and then she said \"ok then bye\" and that was the sum total of our conversation. She even sounded bored! I have seen the oncologist twice - first time was for about 5 minutes to have a quick look at my scar, prescribe anastrozole and tell me I'll be sent radiotherapy appointments. The 2nd appointment  was after 3 radio sessions  as I wanted to ask more questions about the side effects of Anastrozole.   and when I first said \"I'm really concerned about the side effects of osteoporosis from the Anastrozole\", he just said \"I can't force you to take them\" no discussion, nothing! He wouldn't even answer my question about what level ER I was... just said that 'you are ER positive so that's all the matters' So that appointment was less than 5 minutes as well. The radiotherapy (finished last Thursday) felt as if I was on a conveyor belt - the unit covers the whole of the county. There were so many staff that the were different every day, the times were all over the place at the end of it (I had to drive 60 miles there and back) and one appointment was 7pm in the evening - I got home for my dinner at 9pm as there was a delay on the radio machine of 3/4 hour. I made one friend for a brief period, but I missed out on the last few sessions with the times being so 'odd'. She text me to tell me she had rung her bell, but no-one was around at all!  I did at least have some people around and got one of them to take a photo of my milestone. My GP asked to see me to give me the results of my blood test for Vitamin D and DEXA scan. - 1st time I've ever seen him as normally see other GP's in the practice.  I'd asked for B12 test  as I've not eaten meat or fish since I was 13, but had a lot of dairy.  Now I've cut that out, B12 will be a key vitamin I'm missing.  The path lab hadn't tested for B12 so he told me when they retest for Vit D in the spring ask then......6 months???   Then he said \"You seem to be coping well, I'll give you a prescription for some more adcal, ok then bye\".  To me, it feels as if not one of the medical profession gives two hoots about the 'person' I received a few cards from when people first heard the news in July, but apart from one person who I used to manage in my job 15+ years ago texting, asking how I am, offering lifts to radiotherapy / one other friend who I only meet once a month texting a few times during radio - no-one else seems to have \"remembered\" or even be bothered. My best friend since 9 years old is opposite where I work so I see her on the security camera daily and she came once  to my office for some paperwork and after quarter of an hour said \"oh, how's radiotherapy going\" - I was on session 6 out of 15 and she hasn't asked before or since,.  just told me that Breast Cancer's not much of an issue these days, when I first told her. My other half spent most of the time during radiotherapy moaning about aches and pains his back and knees ...  My brother hasn't once asked after me, despite me for over 2 years texting him daily when his wife died and my other half and I taking him on holidays with us ever since. I was told by my boss' wife that he was concerned for a minute or 2, then she jokingly said but then he was more worried about if \"you'd be able to work and what would he do?\"  As it is, I only took one day off after the operation as it coincided with the weekend (which I took as holiday as I don't get paid if I'm sick).  These are just 3 examples of the closest to me, but other family has been as bad if not worse!  (I even got a round robin message on FB from a close family friend yesterday to 'help raise awareness of breast cancer so we can get our game on tv' - nothing else, so clearly forgotten that I'm currently going through it! (I lost my Mum in 2014 and my Dad last year) It just seems that these attitudes are the 'norm' I'm coming across and I'm beginning to feel that people are so self centred and I'm a mug for all the times I've been there for them, supported them through ill health, bereavement, divorce - you name it, I've always been a shoulder etc and no-one seems to give a hoot unless it's about them.,  I don't want to feel so cynical about human nature but it's really getting to me. There we go - rant over :)",

I measured myself for new bra, but I did think about asking my BC nurse or as I bought my new bras at M&S I would be happy to ask them as they specifically sell bras for mastectomies and support BC charities. I thought exactly the same as you about the smear test, but mine was due in May (a month before my annual mammogram) and I'd been convinced that if the cancer was in one place then it was bound to be there too.... it came back perfectly fine, so the upshot I should have trusted the doctors knowledge.

Breast cancer treatments have come on so much in the last few decades - so much so that even in the last year since I was diagnosed new procedures have come into play that weren't offered to me - so from being diagnosed in June 2017, I'm already 'out of date'.  I hope that makes sense that the team treating your Mum will have seen similar 1000's of times and the majority of these ladies will be out there living their lives again and not attending support groups.  I'm stunned by the number of people who messaged me when they heard of my diagnosis who said \"I had that\" or \"10 years remission for me\" or \"34 years ago\" etc etc ER+ and HER2 negative is also a 'good diagnosis' as ER+ is the nicest type.  ER+ means taking some tablets to reduce oestrogen in the body, so it gives a little more confidence that after all the treatment that has got rid of it then there's something else 'fighting' the cancer to stop it coming back.

I had my Dexa scan and am taking Adcal and Vit D as my bones were osteopenai when I was scanned (news to me, but I'm a vegetarian so a lack of protein since 15 probably has made this difference), doctors may well just give you Adcal anyway when taking the Letrozole to prevent the bone thinning when you've had your Dexa scan.

      "Content": "I wondered if ladies might like a thread for a 'thought of the day' as something that has helped or is helping them through this journey. It just occurred to me this morning in respect of the fear that comes along with being diagnosed with breast cancer and other people who haven't had it, but seem to think it's so easy ;) of something that I wish I had said to these people When I was first diagnosed, I had a couple of close friends who had absolutely no understanding of the mental impact and said \"oh such and such had that and they were fine\" type thing.  My worry about it and any need for support was forgotten as soon as they had said it! So, my thought of the day for people who have no understanding: \"Imagine you are stood on a cliff edge in a gale.  There is a 50% chance that a huge gust of wind will blow you over the cliff edge into the stormy sea below.  How would you feel stood there?\"  I think looking back, that this what I felt when diagnosed - the not knowing whether it would be ok or not and being told 'so and so was fine, blah, blah' was to me extremely annoying. But at the same time for someone who hasn't had cancer will try to come out with platitudes and can never really understand even if they want to- so this analogy would perhaps have helped them understand the fear that comes with being told you have cancer. Anyone else have any 'thought for the day\"?",

Having said that, I have always been of the opinion that 'if it's my time, it's my time' and 'going' has never bothered me (I nearly died at 17, so have lived every day since as if it was my last) - but even I have had a couple of wobbly days since being diagnosed and not able to concentrate / cancer springing into my mind every 5 minutes / trying to cash in my pension early etc  and thinking that I'm about to go tomorrow! So I totally understand what you are feeling.  It's irrational and I knew it at the time as the treatment has advanced so much but it didn't seem to stop the panic and the brain seizing on me on those occasions. I have been more reassured by a former neighbour of mine.  Her sister had breast cancer 20+ years ago - she had a mastectomy and then - absolutely nothing!  No radiotherapy, no chemo, no tablets and no follow ups.  She is now in her 80's and her cancer had returned a year ago and spread to her bones - BUT she is still living at home, coping really well and the drugs she is now on are working really well.  Considering her treatment then (compared to the advances and the treatment we receive now) and the fact it is in her bones and she's doing alright at her age - you are young -a huge bonus!  Give them a call to calm yourself down a bit xx",

Stage range from 0 to4 - stages depend on size of tumour and lymph node results.  Stage 1-4 if you look at Cancer research. Stage 0 is DCIS only I gather and might not ever become cancerous. Scaredgirl34 -  Stage 1 is \"early stages breast cancer\" My oncologist actually said (having been diagnosed with Stage 1) - \"we have caught yours really early\".  Grade is the way in which the cells resemble normal cells. Grade 1 - 3.   The nearer normal cells they look and grow the lower the grade they are, but I haven't been concerned over my grade diagnosis as being stage 1 (like you scaredgirl34), as soon as they are gone it doesn't matter how normal or abnormal/how quickly they grow!

I know it's so easy for people to say 'don't worry' when that's all you can do and but I guess if they are thinkging 12 weeks, then although they can't ignore it, they can't be that concerned surely?.  The not knowing is the worst isn't it? I was chatting to a young lady a little while ago who's sister had breast cancer and her team had picked up something on her spine.  The young lady was in bits and had already diagnosed her sister as stage 4 and her and her Mum had convinced themselves that her sister was no longer going to be here in the forseeable future.  A few days later, the results of the scan were perfectly alright and her sister was going to be just fine. So, although not lung issues, hopefully the same principle that the worst thoughts may not always be the case. I've trained myself (following some advice I heard) to think:  Worst case scenario/ middle scenario/best scenario.    If I have looked at the worst, I MUST look at the best and settle my thoughts on the middle - best scenario.  Try doing this for yourself and it doesn't feel quite so scary because actually sometimes the best IS what happens.

(I lost both my parents over the last 2-3 years, so have no other family). My partner who I met late 2014 (when he'd had a few too many to drink) told me how lucky I was to still have him as most men so early in a relationship would have run a mile - Gee thanks for that!!!  He did apologise when he was sober, but.... Conversely, I used to be a bank manager and a staff member from 15+ years ago heard about my breast cancer and has texted frequently asking after me and even offered to give me lifts to radiotherapy (as it's a 60 mile, there and back drive).  Her husband had prostate cancer when I managed her and I guess I must have been supportive  - I can't even remember!!!  But it's made me realise that actually, I'm not going to waste energy on some people who can't be bothered with me (like you say, let those people go from your life and you will know who true friends are).  I have also met a lovely lady at radio and we aim to stay in touch - in an attempt to get one positive thing from having breast cancer, I am a smoker too and really struggling to reduce them.  Did you give up smoking?  If so, that's one REALLY positive thing to come out of it - well done you - you are a STAR!!!  I am going to keep trying and I have shocked myself that even having cancer can't make me give up as I've smoked since I was 13 and am 51 now - even I know I'm being ridiculous! If some days you are struggling to open your curtains, you really must go and see your GP.  Depression is a chemical reaction in your brain and nothing you can do about it until this chemical is rebalanced.  Tablets can assist with that rebalance.  Your body and emotions have been through SO much and it's no wonder you are feeling so low and the chemical balance may have shifted - And as others say, talking is a great release. Macmillan offer financial advice too  with regards to money worries.  Give the helpline a call - 0808 808 00 00. Look after yourself x",

I decided that I would try them and if the side effects were terrible that would be it.  As it is, I've been taking them for nearly a year with only the very odd ache now and again - I've not even had hot flushes!  I also discovered that the Accord brand was better than another brand I took as this caused an ache in my thumb (yes, just the thumb!) but when I went back to the Accord brand this aching thumb disappeared after 3 days.  So, I would suggest that given the fact that these tablets are 'belt and braces' to prevent it coming back that you give them a go.  You never know if you don't try them.  There are several different brands, so even if the first ones you try give you side effects - try a different brand etc.  After all, how would you feel if it came back and you haven't even given them a shot? I've read from others that turmeric and black pepper is good for the aches and pains.  I haven't a clue and I certainly wouldn't take tablets of this as has been suggested by others (I would worry that it could be too much in a condensed form and it might effect something else - for instance I drink green tea, but I do know that too much green tea reduces iron etc so there are risks of too much of a 'good thing' I believe). However, I do use turmeric in my cooking and have black pepper on my salads and vegetables - so who knows!",
