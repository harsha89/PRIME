      "Content": "Hi Carolyn28 Sorry it has taken me so long to reply I have had lots of health issues and have been backwards and forwards to the hospital for various problems. Thankfully I am back on track with extra treatment and drugs and have had my second session of chemo last Monday. Can't say chemo has been easy bit of a shock to the system for the first one and I developed further problems as a result of the chemotherapy and now have had to have further drugs to take throughout my 16 sessions. (2 down so 14 to go). I've watched your video and very helpful posts thank you so much I feel much more reassured now. I hope you are keeping well and continue to fight the fight. Have a good day & thank you again. xx",

      "Content": "Hi TheScriptFan Thank you so much for your reply and so sorry it took me so long to reply. I have been very ill, discovered I had an infection, a kidney problem and a dodgy valve in my heart. I've had lots of tests, MRI scans, heart scans etc but the hospital have got me back on track and I have now had 2 lots of chemotherapy treatment so far. It hasn't been easy however I knew I had a rough ride coming with the chemotherapy and at least I got fit enough to have the 2.  I was scared about chemo because I was told I would have a needle put in my hand, and when I have had cannulas etc put in my hand it is so sore and I bruise so easily and they always do a few attempts at inserting. My first chemo a cannula was inserted into the side of my wrist but it popped out so another was put in higher up on the wrist it was very sore and I the bruises took almost the 3 weeks to heal before I had the next round on Monday this week. I was very ill with the first chemo and my kidneys played up along with my esophagus so I was back in hospital and they got me sorted out. I have extra drugs to take throughout my chemo sessions (16 sessions in total) and they are helping. I cannot fault the treatment I have received from the hospital and staff throughout all this. I also developed a nut allergy on cashew nuts a couple of weeks ago and suffered anaphylactic shock, however I didn't realise it was due to the cashew nuts until the same thing happened last week. The first time I was taken into hospital and they thought it was a reaction to the first chemotherapy. After last week I now know it was allergy and I am being tested. The second bought of chemo I was having a bad day. I am using the cold cap and had been told to take painkillers about 15 minutes before my chemotherapy. This time round I found it extremely painful and it was hard to keep it on for the whole of my session. I was laid down because I couldn't get warm and wasn't feeling too good at all. The few days after though I haven't been too bad. Obviously I am avoiding all nuts (I had a few crushed nuts on my porridge but now I'm avoiding totally). I have rested more, distressed more and listened to my body so I think I can handle this. I haven't been outside my front door in 3 days but I haven't fell well enough and really needed to sleep a lot. Today I am going out whatever the weather even just for a short work and a cup of decaffeinated coffee or herbal tea along the way. I just wanted to thank all of you lovely ladies for all your support when I needed it in January. I hope you are all keeping well and fighting the fight. We are all cancer warriors together and we will win.  Lots of love and hugs to you and all of you that took the time to reply and thank you once more  xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply WhatHappened and you have given me much food for thought. I did have an infection in my wound and had to stay in hospital for the night. Last week I had a discharge again from the nipple (which has been re-positioned) and I phoned the Breast cancer nurse and she told me to get into the shower and run hot water over the wound and gently massage the nasty stuff out and continue with my paracetamol and Ibuprofen which I did do. Just over 4 weeks on and I am still very bruised but not as sore as I was and the area around my nipple is still scabbed over but looks clean. So the aches are in my legs and hands and to be honest I have osteo-arthritis so that is probably what the pains are. I am regularly doing the exercises everyday and certainly every time I get a glass of water (which is quite often) because I used to go the gym and Zumba and have always done lots of exercise which I have had to stop the last couple of months although I was trying to take a brisk walk to the park 10 minutes away when I wasn't feeling so rough. The headaches - well I am prone to migraines so maybe there is a connection somewhere although they aren't migraine and are usually when I wake up for a few hours even though I drink lots of water. You are spot on with the shock, I believe reality is hitting me. I had stage 4 skin cancer in 2003/2004 and had 2 young children then and was in a real state but got through with all the treatment. This time round I have been full of bravado telling everybody I've got this I can get through it etc. I'm not scared. I have been holding it all in because my daughter has been very ill and stressed out herself with all this and I was trying to be brave for her and my son who had come for Christmas as a surprise from New Zealand. I hadn't seen him in the flesh for nearly 6 years.  When I think about it the last few days I have been very tearful, I am starting to realise this is real and is serious in fact more serious than I expected. The oncologist told me had I not gone and got checked out when I did I would probably have been dead by March 2019 so that was a shock to be told that last week. I say I'm not scared of chemo but actually deep down I am, it didn't seem like all this was happening to me. I heard of others going through chemo & radiotherapy etc but haven't actually experienced chemo before. I'm also not good with anesthetic so did react badly following the lumpectomy. I did phone my breast nurse and made her aware of all these symptoms before I return to the oncologist on Friday so I felt a bit better after talking to her. Thank you so much for your response, it all makes sense to me now. Hope you are well yourself and enjoy the rest of your evening. Big hugs xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Leolady56 thank you for your reply. Yes lots of WhatHappened's message rang bells and I now realise why I've been feeling this way.  I did get an infection in the wound which is now healing up quite nicely still scabby but clean some bruising but not so painful anymore. I am 58 and yes I have other health issues, I have osteoarthritis in my legs and hands and slight scoliosis of the top of my spine. I also have a tendency to suffer migraine headaches although very occasionally. The nausea and sickness is not something I'm used to however I do have a dairy allergy and a wheat allergy and may well have overdone it with dry white bread and dry white toast  (haven't got any of my own special bread in at the moment) to try and settle my sickness. Also my boyfriend begged me to eat the scrambled egg on buttered toast he made me a couple of days ago as he is worried about me losing my appetite. It all makes perfect sense to me now and I also realise that I am beginning to accept that I have a serious condition even though I have had a skin cancer before. This site is wonderful for all the warmth and support and friendship I am so lucky. The rest is something I have found difficult to deal with because I am usually a very active busy person but my strength is so zapped right now my bed is my permanent home LOL. I hope you yourself are keeping well  Big hugs to you xxx",
