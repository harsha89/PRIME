Still seems a long slog until it finishes.",

For anyone considering the cold cap, my experience has been very good so far - I have hardly lost any hair.  Having said that I am beginning to find going near freezers very off putting - don't know how it will feel after 6 treatments!

      "Content": "Thanks Karen, I have had a look and will give WOW a go, it might give me a few more weeks whilst its just roots.  I've read  sometimes Cold Cap and chemo stop the hair growing, thats definitely not the case for me - it seems to be growing faster.  I think by the end I will have the dipped hair look.  I definitely recommend you give the Cold Cap a go - It is horrible to start with, the strap made me gag and it felt claustrophobic as it was so tight - but like everyone says if you give it 10 minutes you get past all that.  My hair has survived two rounds of FEC and I'm beginning to believe it will work, so far lost very little.  I also bought a silk pillowcase and wash my hair only twice a week - used to be every day.  Head is itchy but for me its a small price.  Also take pain relief before you put the cold cap on and after as it does give you a headache. I think the headaches were from one of the antisickness drugs - so am hoping today they can give me a different drug.  Good luck",
