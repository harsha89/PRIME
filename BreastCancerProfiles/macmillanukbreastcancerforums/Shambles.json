    "Content": "Hey everyone, and thankyou in advance for reading my woes. This is my first post here so please bare with me. I am coming up to my 46th birthday, and was diagnosed with BC shortly after my 43rd birthday, so 3 yrs ago. It was caught very early, grade 1 and I had a lumpectomy and auxillary node removal, which showed no evidence of spread, followed by radiotherapy and what should have been 5yrs of tamoxifen. My problem is, I have suffered from various depression and anxiety disorders for almost 20 years, and this diagnosis exacberated them HUGELY. I told no one of my diagnosis, no family, no friends, and I went through the entire diagnostic tests, surgeries and decisions for further treatments alone. Although daunting, I did ok until half way through my radiotherapy when I left the cancer centre in tears, threw my mobile into the sea (treatment was at Brighton cancer centre) and never returned. Tamoxifen had already been prescribed but I stopped that beast after a month of my anxiety increasing. Added to this i have not been to my oncologist appointments or follow up mammos. Recently my anxiety levels have increased to the point of me ending up in hospital and being referred to a psychiatrist, who within the last couple of weeks has diagnosed me with social phobia. I am now on new medications to help with this and feel a slight improvement but I'm still scared to heck of seeing the Big Docs as I've left my situation so long I'm afraid I may never forgive myself if I've blighted all chance of waving goodbye to the BC forever, hence setting me back into that awful cycle again. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here by way of a reply, just thoughts and suggestions, I guess. Anyways, sorry for being so long winded, and if you've reached the end of this post, I both salute and thankyou!! Hoping today finds you well X",
