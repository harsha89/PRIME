    "Content": "Hi Woodstock. I gather by now, youÂ  will have decided yes/no. I went for the removal of both breast 8 years ago, had no problems, and have never regretted it. I found the Arimidex I had to take for 5 years the worse part of it all, due to the weight gain. My daughter is just starting the same problem, and after watching me, is going to do the same. I know I could not have lived with keep checking there was nothing in my breast all the time. I now have peace of mind, and cancer is rarely on my mind. Love Poppyp",
