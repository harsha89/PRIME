    "Content": "I have been with the same Health Centre here in Dunedin NZ for the past 25 1/2 years and only ever considered changing once and that was during the time I was ill and before my diagnoses of NHL in 2003. It took over a year to get an answer to my illness and wondered if I ever would. I was seeing the same GP on a regular basis trying to get answers as to why I felt so unwell, unable to eat and losing weight. In saying that most of my symptons could be put down as the flu but as it carried on for months I had hoped and thought that more tests would have been carried out. All that is in the past now and I still see the same GP that gave me my diagnoses. I continue going to him because I know he will be more through than in the past. If I can't get to see him and only if it is urgent will I see any on the other Dr's at the practice. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sometimes it better the devil you know than the one you don\"t",
