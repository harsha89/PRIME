      "Content": "I only had a lumpectomy and lymph node op, but I did buy one of those V shape pillows from Dunelm Mill in readiness and found it very useful for sleeping and still do.  I also used it on the settee when watching tv, I could usually put it in a position which I was comfortable in, I still use it 3 weeks later with one side under my normal pillow and the other down the side of me - it stops me rolling over onto my \"op side\".  They sell pillow cases to fit too.  Hope this helps you to sleep better.

I would suggest looking around and chatting to other patients, you never know if it could help you too.... Hope this suggion will help someon else xxxx",

I am just waiting for the results from the nodes and hope to have them soon. The op wasn't too bad but surprisingly it is my arm pit which is the most tender, be prepared for your boob to feel swollen, that surprised me, feels like I did when breast feeding 40 years ago. I recommend a \"Comfy bra\" or two from asda £6 to wear night and day in the size above what you would normally buy.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  Good luck x ",

Started rads on 21 St may  2 days after returning from Spain. All going OK but did not expose any of breast area to sun, factor 50 and a pretty scarf over left shoulder area. As for insurance had this ongoing for years with a credit card at bank, and just risked it on this occasion. However I have a holiday booked to Tunisia end of august and googled holiday insurance with cancer. Got 2 weeks cover for me and hubby including breast cancer and high cholesterol high blood pressure etc for about £56.00 . was happy with that . don't think I am covered for anything cancer related but I am not convinced that if I go abroad the cancer will make me have to brought home.
