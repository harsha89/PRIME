    "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy last year, but my nodes were clear.  However, my sister & a close friend were told that their nodes were cancerous & both of them had all of their nodes removed because that was the advice they were given by their surgeons.  Hope this helps.  I know it is a difficult time & hard to know what the right decisions are about your treatment.  My thoughts are with you & I totally get the going crazy part.  It will be an ongoing thing, but you are not alone. Hugs, Alison x",
