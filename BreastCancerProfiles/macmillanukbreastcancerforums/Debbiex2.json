If it is your chemo causing it then are they talking about a different chemo. Not all drugs suit all people. I lost a stone within a week then it stopped there. So hopefully you wont loose any more.

Went a bit mad with the exercises cos no body explained them to me properly so just went into them full on. But that was good, cos when I went to a physcio for a check up she was amazed that I had so much movement after only 3 weeks. I also had cording after t he operation but that did'nt bother me and it vanished after about 4 months. This year I decided to go for a reconstruction. Had a few unimportant probs with it (crease in the implant, so it had to come out) so going back in feb to have it all finished off. Still no pain with any of that. The one thing I can say, is that I was fit before I went into my op. and as it was over 2 months from diagnosis to op, I made an extra effort to get as fit as poss so that the six weeks recuperation would'nt leave me to floppy. I did not do anything after the operation that was a no no, as I wanted to be back to work 6 weeks to the day. I wish you all the very best with your op and recuperation. Keep intouch and let us know how it is going. lol and (((((HUGS))))) Debbie and Robbie xxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi there caroline, I agree with the brave bit, gets my goat up. We wake up one morning and find we have cancer and have no choice but to cope in what ever way we can. Anyway, FEC, I was on that for 6 x 3 weeks. Not a prob for me. I lost my hair after 2nd dose. Decided to shave it off when it began to come loose. I was given a goodie bag to go home with which had anti sick pills, steroids (for 24 hour anti sick) and mouth wash as you can be subject to mouth ulcers. They forgot to give me my goodie bag on the second and third time, and I thought maybe you only got it first time so said nothing. Well, as I was ok after those treatments I didnt bother with the steroids at all. The chemo used to make me feel heavy headed so I came home and went to bed. Stayed there for 24 hours then took a day to get back on my feet, then back to work. I was sick, just once each time and always about 8pm so it became all part of the routine. Sometimes if your white cells have not got back to full strength then you have to wait an extra week before you can have your chemo. One of the drugs in the FEC cocktail, burns in private places but just for a second or two and they do warn you. I was advised to eat before chemo because if it did make me sick, better to have something in my tum. Before, during and after chemo I made sure I kept as healthy as pos and ate plenty of fruit and veg. I assume a portacath is so you dont have to have needles stuck in you each time, if so that is really good, makes it so much easier. I could'nt have anything like that as i work with horses and could not be sure to keep it clean. Ooooh, ive rather gone on a bit. hope its of help. Ask more if you want Best wishes for a smooth ride through chemo, LOL Debbie and April xxxx",

Also for those cold nights and when in doors and not wanting to wear a scarf all the time I highly recommend Muslim prayer caps, obtainable from the internet. If you are good with a needle you can sew pretty sequins or motifs on them. I hated the \"chemo scarves\". I have a very little head and they just looked awful on me. Best of luck",

I took pics of mine and sent them to the Ameona life people (can be googled) they done an article about cording, I think it was july 07. They put the pic in the mag. This is (i think where the ligaments or tendon goes into a spasm) and go taught thus leaving a \"rope like\" sinue sticking out across the armpit. I had this after my op, it slowly went over a few months I think. Not sure how long it was, but just noticed one day that it had gone. As for the numbness, that sometimes goes sometimes stays. All depends on the nerve damage/repair. The whole of my arm was numb but now (3 years on) only part of the armpit is numb. no more shaving with a bic as too risky. Now have to use an electric razor. got a really nice narrow one in Argos, v cheap called Remmington lady shave. The head is only half inch wide. I hope we have all managed to give you some idea and you feel better about the whole situation. You can always talk to the help line on here they are great. I wish you all the very best with any further treatment. Lol Debbie and April",

It is a very long hard journey but at the end you will look back and think \"was that really me\". As Kate says, they inject local and what with the interference with the nerves you prob wont have any pain. Be aware of the first time you touch your arm pit. It is very dead and feels like a lump of rubber. A most disconcerting feeling. But as with everything else you will get some feeling back in time and you also get used to the feelings.

A bit like a blister. If you dont pop it, when the skin has healed underneath then it begins to reabsorb the fluid. I dont know if this is the same as armpit and arm fluid retention. But hopefully it will go down with time. I have great faith in my onc and if she had said leave it i would have. So how do you feel about yours. You can also ask on the help line on here. There advice is totally impartial. I am glad to hear that your team at maidstone were good and supportive. You could also call your macmillan nurse. The exercises do get easier and before you know it, you will be back to doing all the things you are used to with that arm. I wish you all the very best. lol n hugs Debbie and April xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

But to be told that all the secondary could have been avoided if a proper diagnosis had been given in the first place, just adds to the hell that you are all going through. This is happening just too often, it really must stop. We are constantly hearing how consultants and oncologists are just not interested in or giving time to their patients, and as i do understand they are rushed off their feet, never the less every patient deserves the very best attention to detail, and if you cant rely and trust on them then where the bliddy hell can you turn? Sorry, I've gone on to rant mode. I wish your dad every success.
