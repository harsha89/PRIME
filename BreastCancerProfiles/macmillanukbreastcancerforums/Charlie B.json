It certainly is a roller coaster - my emotions are all over the place!  It's great to hear that other people have fodder the same ride and got off safely on the other side! I'm working hard at being positive and focusing on taking each day as it comes. Xxx Charlie ",

      "Content": "Thank you, Gay. I'm trying hard to be positive - it's mostly at night those sneaky thoughts creep in! I've told my consultant I'll go with whatever she suggests and I'm sure we'll beat this. At the moment I'm running on adrenaline at 100 miles an hour so I guess I'll have to see what happens when it sinks in properly! You're right though, worry is not the answer!  Charlie xx",

      "Content": "Hi - I'm completely new to this so please bear with me. I was referred after a routine mammogram and had further mammograms, ultrasound and four biopsies just before Christmas. The consultant said she thought the results were likely to be positive and I've been diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer ER+  in my left breast. I also have another lump which they believe is benign but don't know what it is! This morning I received my appointment for an MRI (Sunday morning) and will get the results on Wednesday. My surgery is scheduled for Feb 2nd.  All of this has come completely out of the blue and I'm feeling a bit weird. The holidays were pretty awful with all of us wondering if it was or wasn't actually cancer, so the results actually came as a relief - I felt happier knowing what it was...now I'm worried they're going to find something else. Anyone else out there with lobular cancer?",
