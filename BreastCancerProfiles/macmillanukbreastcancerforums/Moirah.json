      "Content": "Hi all I was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2018 I had op and tumour was removed, also had two lymph nodes removed.  Oncoligist said I was lucky as they managed to get it all away in op. However he referred me for 15 preventative radiotherapy sessions, I had my last one 10th feb 2019. He also prescribed Tamoxifen, which brings its own wee set of problems, but manageable. Icouldnt look at my wounds at first, it was very difficult for me but breast nurse advised me to get to know my new shape boob. This is making me paranoid as I can feel a hard large lump in area where tumour was, also got a wee crust on nipple. Is this normal.? or do I need to see someone about this? . ",
