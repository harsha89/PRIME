      "Content": "Hi I've finished chemo and waiting to start radiotherapy and I am thinking long term about restoring my health after the rigors of the treatment... There seems to be no end of information about recovery and all sorts of different diets, supplements etc..that I am a bit overwhelmed! Does anyone have any experience or recommendations to share? I've made a start with Johnathan Chamberlain's - 'Cancer - the complete recovery guide.'  In terms of emotional recovery - like many others I can highly recommend - 'Rise' by Sian Williams.  I read it in a couple of days and I am now re-reading it - it's uplifting and a great help Thanks to all xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi I had my last radiotherapy session yesterday after surgery and chemo and today rather than being elated I do feel a bit down... I can recommend Sian William's book - \"Rise\" which I read whilst recovering from chemo before the radiotherapy started.  I've also found out that the Maggie centres run a 'Where now?' course for people at the end of their treatment.  A friend recommended it highly - its 7 weeks long and addresses just these issues.  I know not everyone has a Maggies centre close by .. but it if you do it might be worth looking into? best wishes be kind to yourselves X",
