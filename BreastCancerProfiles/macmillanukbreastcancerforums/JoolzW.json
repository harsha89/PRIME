    "Content": "FEC is a nasty one!!!!!  After my first lot of FEC I spent the whole night throwing up, I then spoke to my oncologist who gave me stronger anti-sickness tablets, I still felt sick but at least wasn't being sick any more. I found it a bit like morning sickness - I could only eat what I fancied when I fancied it!!!  I kept frozen meals to hand, as by the time I prepared anything I felt to sick to eat it!! Also, nibbling on ginger biscuts and sipping ginger tea helped as well as lemonade!!!! A friend of mine also found wearing travel sick bands helped her.  But most importantly, hang on in there - you may feel different tomorrow and it will be worth it in the end :)",
