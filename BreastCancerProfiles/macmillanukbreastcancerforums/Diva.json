    "Content": "I am due to have a mastectomy very soon as  invasive cancer has been diagnosed in more than one area of my left breast. I shall be having axillary node clearance on the left side as well.  I am trying to decide whether or not to ask for a double mastectomy as lobular neoplasia has been diagnosed in the right breast. The surgeon is going to do a surgical biopsy on that side but I am anxious that cancer may develop in the right breast if I don't have it removed. The surgeon is reluctant to remove the right breast but he understands my concerns and says he will do it if it is what I want. I have been trying to weigh up the pros and cons.  Will a double mastectomy mean twice the recovery time? Is it better to play safe or wait and see? I am 60 years old and would not be interested in reconstruction. I know the that whichever option I chose it will be traumatic.  I was only diagnosed on 29 August and feel very scared. ",
