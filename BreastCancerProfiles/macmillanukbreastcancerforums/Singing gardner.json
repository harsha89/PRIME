      "Content": "Hi, My hair after the first lot of chemo has gone quite thin, I am now on capecitabine oral chemo and I was quite concerned about putting ammonia on my hair, so I use Nice'n easy no ammonia, it lasts up to 24 shampoos, but as you said it doesn't lighten quite as much, but it looks quite good.   24 shampoos lasts as long as about the same time that people normally have their hair cut, it comes in quite a few shades. Good luck. Singing Gardener.",

      "Content": "Hi, I was on anatrozole after my operation and treatments, I had same problem as you with pains in joints and trigger finger etc., so I talked to my oncologist and told him it was definitely the anatrozole and asked him if there was another one that would give less side effects, he said that rather than stop me from all tablets he would put me on Tamoxifen, this did the trick my joints were occasionally stiff but nowhere as bad.  I have had the cancer come back into my bones now, but the doctor says it was not because I changed tablets.  Hope this helps you decide.  Only you know your own body don't stand for any nonsense from them.",
