      "Content": "W.D Hi Sarah . Like you I have just been diagnosed with Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, I'm 48 . I'm having a Lumpectomy beginning of next week, I wanted a Mastectomy but the doctors talked me round to a Lumpectomy as my tumour is what they call \"small\" (16mm at iopsy point) so they think they can get it all out . Waiting is the pits, I think I've driven myself round in circles searching info which is really not a good idea other than on \"trusted sites\" .  My children are 17 and 27 Hi there, i had a lumpectomy (2 Lumps 10mm and 18mm and 3 senital nodes taken last tuesday,although i know its invasive ductal cancer, i have not had a grade but will be told on Friday at the results, the operation was preceded by wires being put in with scan and local anestetic and xrays and then going to get stuff that glows inside put in then theatre in the afternoon, i have a scar under arm about 3 inches very near body and also 2 and half inch scar on breast, they have been stiched with disolvable stitches on inches and glued on the outside,i have had no pain from anywhere and was out of hospital the next morning, although you've not to lift arm up high and do wee excerises, need someone to undo bra for a few days, try and keep busy, it makes the time pass, we are fortunate that we dont have to wait long really, wishing you all the best x",
