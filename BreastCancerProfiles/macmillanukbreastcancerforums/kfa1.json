    "Content": "I appreciate the need to raise funds (I used to be a Specialist Palliative Care Nurse for a charity set up by MacMillan) but I am opposed to your lack of understanding over this issue. As a cancer patient now I realise that some professionals have absolutely no idea of how issues like this effect us. It is insensitive of MacMillan to capitalise on cancer patients misery. We don't feel brave when our hair falls out, we don't go down the pub and laugh while our hair is shaved in front of a crowd whilst being filmed. We don'tÂ  have a facebook page solely advertising this awful side effect.",
