      "Content": "ive been off since dx in nov 12. had chemo,lumpectomy, anc and start rads julyfor three wks. my onc  said the effects can last up to eight wks after and thats only three wks not four like you. Apparently the fatigue is the worst side effect so you cant be expected to work competently or safely under tgose circumstances. I would refer your work nurse to your consultant if shes not happy. You need ur rest. rads effecr ur white blood count hence the tiredness. Its not like ur just lying on a sunbed- its serious sh!t! I get peed off with occupational health nurses making fol ok s feel guilty.  Do what is right for you and your situation- your the one goinv thro it. HTH wishing you much luck x",

      "Content": "Dorothee -  thank you so much for your lovely post. You managed to put into words exactly how I feel. Your writing is beautiful and very moving. I am going to print off your post and keep it in my bag for times when I feel a bit \"ropey\" , After I read your post,  I had a lovely quiet day yesterday in my garden just relaxing and having time to reflect on whats happened over the last six months. In other words, sitting on top of the \"mountain\" enjoying the view! I am so lucky to have such a positive outcome. I am going to take this summer to build up my emotional and physical strength and not feel, or be made to feel guilty about it. Thank you for all your posts -  they mean a lot   Love Janetx",

      "Content": "Hello, I hope you dont mind me popping in but i was so delighted to find this thread. I was dx in nov 12 and had chemo till Mar 13  followed by lumpectomy in April and last weel full anc. The good news is that ive responded really well to the chemo and there were no cancer cells found. I will be on herceptin till nxt jan and abt to start letrazole. I will be having rads starting in July. I dont need to tell you folks how hard its been despite having lots of wonderful support. I know i should be jumping for joy at the news cos its fantastic, but to tell the truth, im bloomin terrified. I am so tired and still in a bit of pain in my arm (seroma). I am a very positive person as a rule but I dont know how i should  be feeling does that make sense? I am still off work and i dont feel ready in any way to even think about that. I could do wth some \"garden leave\" just to get my head together. How long does it take to feel kind of normal again? It was so nice to read your posts esp as you are further down the line than me. Im sorry for the ramble but if anyone has time to give me some advice or point me in the right direction, Id realy appreciate it.   Thanks so much xx",
