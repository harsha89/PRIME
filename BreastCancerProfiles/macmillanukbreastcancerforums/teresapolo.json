The waiting game is also quite hard especially if you are a normally full on busy person. This website is amazing as there is always someone responding to any question or anxiety that you may have.

      "Content": "Hiya - replying here in case my experience helps you or anyone else. As opting for mastectomy without recon - mainly for the reasons being did not want to use my body tissue and was not happy of the thought of an implant and being very active horsey person wanted to heal asap and not good at being a patient either.  It was a very scary decision like any of the horrible choices we had to make.  So being flat is only now sinking in as I do get quite conscious that it is obvious even though I am constantly being reassured by family and friends that I look fine. I mainly wear the soft bra insert and can honestly say I forget about it riding and doing general stuff. But did catch sight in mirror when riding that only one boob moved and panicked that everyone would see but when had sensible head on no one would be looking out for that.  I have only used the prosthetic a few times as could not wear it riding as it is heavy which I was surprised about when I got it but is ok when I have worn it. But bought several soft inserts for when changing bras and feel happier in them.  It feels strange if I touch it so conscious if I give someone a hug in case it feels odd to them.  Not having big boobs to start with thought it would not notice but I cannot put on a top without a bra as makes my other boob look big and lopsided.  Obviously the other point is looking at myself is not one of my favourite views.  I have had thoughts of enquiring about removing my other breast to even myself up but probably would not be brave enough.  My surgeon did say I could have an implant at a later date if I changed my Mind but again don't think I could go through the stress of surgery and seromas again.  As we are going into summer probably will have to pick out certain tops that would not show too much.  Not sure if I'd be happy to go swimming as so many firsts to get through.  Please ask if there are any other questions about my decision I made. But when reading everyone's experiences there is no such thing as the right choice.  Thinking of you - T xx",

Did you have radiotherapy and how did that affect your riding? Sorry to ask when you need answers yourself but do not know of any riders that have gone through this.  I hope your symptoms have not got any worse and would appreciate any tips you have on coping with the treatment while trying to look after horses.

I know we are all different but hearing your reactions to your treatment has helped. Thanks again  Teresa xx",
