    "Content": "Hi Dawn,  Our cancer information team also wanted to add a little bit more  about this tool, in case it's helpful for any members- they wrote: This tool should be used in the presence of your Health Care Professional in order to be sure the information you put in is correct and that you can interpret the outcome correctly... Here\u2019s Predict's disclaimer: PREDICT uses an algorithm based on information from many thousands of women in England. However, it can only provide a general guide to possible outcomes in any individual case. As we are all different, for the more complete picture in your case, you should speak to your own specialist. http://www.predict.nhs.uk/ Best wishes Laura Su",
