      "Content": "Hi - I've been taking Letrozole for just over a year - my oncologist did say that it was ok to take a break for two weeks for holidays & so I have done this recently. I can't say apart from a few aches & pains & mild hot flushes that I really noticed a difference-but I was conscious of the fact that it was praying on my mind on a daily basis what risk I was putting myself under by doing this & restarted after 14 days. I don't want to jeopardise all the hard work & effort by the wonderful NHS & me getting through all the tough treatment to get well again. It's our choice what we do but I'd hate not to take the advice that this is the drug that will help me prevent a recurrence. ",

      "Content": "Hi Sacha It\u2019s 2 years since I had treatment for Breast cancer but I remember after chemo & radiotherapy my hair really started to grow back around 6 weeks of finishing the treatment. I had Herceptin for a year as I was HER2 positive-that didn\u2019t really give me any side effects just tiredness. I was very careful with my scalp & kept to the Simple shampoo. I think everyone is different my friends hair was growing back even when she was having radiotherapy! Good luck x",
