      "Content": "Hi All really interesting discussion about not choosing reconstruction and going for double- Mastectomy. I wonder if you know about this organisation called 'Flat Friends' ? http://www.flatfriends.org.uk/ Their purpose is this: \"Flat Friends UK is dedicated to supporting women who have had mastectomy surgery without breast reconstruction, including those who may face such decisions now or in the future, due to either a breast cancer diagnosis or preventative surgery. We see living breast free as a positive choice.\" good luck everyone! By the way I didn't go for this (me? - only one breast affected, caught fairly early, wanted symmetry so went for Diep reconstruction- been out of hospital 2 weeks now) But if the other breast goes bad in the future, I think I will opt to 'go flat' and have some glorious tattoos!! x GlitchSlayer x",
