    "Content": "I'm soon to be tested for male breast cancer (or Paget's disease of the breast). Last Monday, my doc found a lump behind my nipple, and another in the lymphoid area under my armpit - I had been getting an eczema-like condition on my nipple, but because I suffer from eczema anyway, it was left a bit longer than perhaps it should have been. I was been advised that I would be seen under the \"2 week rule\", but so far have not had any comminication from the clinic in question. I suppose I'm a bit scared, because at 45 years old, I would not expect to get this  - also, I am a nutritionist, and know that I am way down the list on lfestyle risk factors. However, with the relatively bad prognosis for this type of Paget'sin males, as I understand it, I am currently beginning to \"put things in order\". Which may not be a bad thing - I'm generally so disorganised! If anyone out there cares to mention anything re my situation, I'd be most grateful. I wish all of you every best wish in coping with anything that comes your way. Peter",
