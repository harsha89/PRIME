      "Content": "I was diagnosed in 2008 when my son was 5 and had a lumpectomy and elective chemo and radiotherapy now I'm on tamoxifen. We told him a had a poorly boob and he was really sweet after my surgery getting his doctors bag out and bringing me flowers. He found it unsetteling when my hair fell out and was a nightmare at bedtimes playing up and telling me I was going to die all the time. We arranged some play therapy through Dimbleby Cancer Care and as my treatment went on things improved, I was taken into hospital a couple of times with a high temperature and this was in the middle of the night so when he woke up I was gone. I put on weight with tamoxifen and I'm still trying to build up my fitness level so I can't run around with him as much as I would like and we wont have any more kids. He is now 9 and seems to resent me so much we can be fine but if he gets frustrated the first thing that comes up is my cancer - how he hasn't got brothers and sisters like his friends - the final straw was last week when he said 'I hope you get cancer again' I was devastated and so was he when he saw how sad I was. We have been waiting for an appointment for counseling for him with out local children's services since October 2011 - can anyone think of any other resources or coping strategies. I know he loves me and I love him its just part of the impact that this disease has and at least he has his mum.",

      "Content": "Hi Jamesy to be honest the school are sitting back a bit as they did when I was first diagnosed and I got him some play therapy through Dimbleby Cancer Care at St Thomas's. He has had some problems with anxiety and wanting to be home and we was getting sick headaches a lot at school we have worked through that with them and his class teacher has been a big help there. I think the referal may be to CAHMS we have various people from the school and gp's chasing up the referal but I'm thinking of going back to see if Dimbleby or McMillan can offer anything short term. My husband gets very frustrated with the anger directed to me by my son and I must admit after 4 years it is wearing me down a bit especially since my chemo and radiotherapy were elective and a lot of my decision to go ahead was to ensure I was giving him the best chance of keeping his mum. I'm in a similar situation with children to you, I was reasured by one doctor not to worry as I could get pregnant at 47 when I finish tamoxifen and she seemed quite suprised that I didn't jump for joy at that one! I just want to be the parent of 1 well adjusted boy with a body that has a better fitness level than I do on tamoxifen so that's what I'm going to work towards. You sound like you are doing a great job with your daughter and both comments on here have made me feel more positive - thanks.xxx  ",

      "Content": "Flower I was in a similar place in 2008 when I was 41 didn't find a lump but an area that didn't feel right, needle biopsy wasn't conclusive and at the ultrasound scan she mentioned specs of cancer - but I had to wait a few more days for a diagnosis. My little boy was 5 and I was terrified and tearful but also proud of myself for finding it myself and dealing with it in the right way by insisting my gp referred me. I did have cancer - quite agressive but not spread to lymph nodes and a lumpectomy, chemo and radiotherapy and tamoxifen have just seen me get my third clear mamogram result. Its not easy sometimes I wanted to run out of the hospital and be normal me but take it a step at a time and be kind to yourself. I'm thinking of you.",
