      "Content": "Hi, this is my first time posting on here so hope im doing it right! I am 24 and was diagnosed with breast cancer this January (2 weeks after my 24th birthday.) and it is a bit difficult as a 'young breast cancer sufferer' is usually classed as under 50 so Im always the youngest in the chemo ward! It was a shock, but Im sure it would be a huge shock at any age. I have just had my 5th chemo on tues, I had 3 FEC and will have 3 Tax, one more to go! I can't wait! I will then have 20 radiotherapy, which Im not too worried about from what I have heard. I also had a lumptecomy and lymph node removal before I started chemo. I can't believe how quickly it has flown over, chemo isn't fun but its definately do-able and not as bad as I thought it would be (except the first Tax which hit me like a bus, its alot better now I have codeine painkillers.)  Im just so thankful for my husband and my parents as they have been amazing through the whole thing. I think you just have to stay positive and look forward to the future:-)",

      "Content": "Hi,  I have just finished 6 chemo sessions about 4 weeks ago (3 FEC and 3 Taxotere.) I had heard that you could lose nails with the Taxotere. About 1 weeks ago I took my nail varnish off and noticed my nails were WHITE, a few days later I noticed some were bright red and some looked half white (as though they were coming away from the nail base) the whiteness has continued down my fingers and there is one nail that feels like its not fully attached. Not pretty but I just keep them painted and nobody can tell lol. ",
