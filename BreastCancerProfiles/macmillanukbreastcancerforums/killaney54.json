Sounds like you're coping well, I hope that eveything continues well with you. Kaite. ",

Had a follow up appointment with oncologist who thinks it is most likely alopociea areata but is referring me to dermatologist for more help. So guess the wig has to stay for a while longer! Hope you are all doing well and having \"good days\".    ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone - new to this so hope I'm not repeating someone elses question. Diagnosed with breast cancer last Oct - lumpectomy last Nov, chemo Dec to April and now just finished  radiotherapy and started Tamoxifen for five years. Having got through all the various treatments I'm desperate for my hair to grow back so I can start feeling \"normal\" again. Seems to be some regrowth but I have a lot of bald circles (good Dalmation dog impersonation !) and think it may be because of Tamoxifen - has anyone else gone thro this? Any tips for speeding up hair re growth?",
