      "Content": "Hi Jane,I'm new to the site to. Been reading lots of information on cancer but thought it would be nice to have some feedback from people who have been through it. I'm 49 and married with two kids aged 21 and 18. Like you i'm on a bit of a rollercoaster - happy one minute and upset the next. I was diagnosed from a routine mammogram. I was recalled but just thought it was routine as it was my first mammogram and the letter says they sometimes need to check the breast again when it is your first time. I had no lumps. I was told at this appointment that they thought I had cancer in my right breast and lymph nodes on both sides and would need a biopsy to confirm. I felt like someone had hit me with a sledgehammer and I was dreaming. They found a 3cm cancer in my right breast but nothing in the lymph nodes. I had a sentinel biopsy to confirm that my nodes are clear and am due to go on Wednesday for the results. If they are clear I am due to have a mastectomy and reconstruction with DIEP fap on the 26th June. Has anyone had this procedure. Not looking forward to the lying on my back with a heat pad on after the op. Not good at sitting, never mind lying still. I would just like to say that I have a great admiration for all the ladies who are going through or have been through this treatment. You all seem incredibly brave and optomistic which gives me great hope. The support of my friends and family has been a great comfort and help. the surgeons and breast cancer nurses have also been fantastic. All I will finish with is - thank goodness for the lowering of the breast cancer screening age limit. i'm proof that this move is very worthwhile  ",

Thanks again for the information and good luck to everyone going through chemo at the moment. Carol X",

      "Content": "Hi Judy, Sorry didn't reply to you message. Could not reply as went in for my operation on 26th June. Like you I had ten hour operation and it went well. I was bought to my room on the surgical ward on the hottest night of the year so needless to say I wasn't allowed the window open or a fan because they had to keep the flap warm. It nearly killed me as don't like feeling hot at the best of times. Like you I was up out of bed by day three and moving about by day four. Back at home since Tuesday and ok. Can get about a bit but tried to do too much yesterday and was shattered so taking it easy today. Tummy and breast ok but notice that if i stand up for to long or bend at my waist too much I can get lower back pain. My breasts look ok as i have had a reduction in the other one so they match up. Going next wednesday for results, stitches out and detaiI of what happens next. Good luck with the rest of your treatment and I hope your back problems improve in ther future. I already feel like I have made the right decision and I can cope with any further treatment offered. Carol    ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the information Kate. The doctors and cancer nurses at the hospital have been great but they try to give you a positive slant on everything. They said today that I would be okay with lifting after a few months. I asked because my job involves me carting lots of stuff around - not necessarily heavy stuff but lots of boxes and equipment. Thanks for your honesty. I hope I will be able to lift okay eventually but I'm sure I will probably suffer some setbacks on the way. I've been given a leaflet today with exercises for after surgery so I will take it to hospital and have a go. Thanks again for your help. Carol",

      "Content": "Welcome back home Nina and good luck with your recovery and future treatment. I suppose its early days and things can only get better. I am very happy with the results of my recon and like you can't wait to have all the dressings off and have a shower or bath. Know what you mean about the drains especially when I was allowed a shower on the fifth day but still had three drains in. How do you shower when your drains don't touch the floor and you want to wash your hair. Had to put them in a bed pan in a comode to hold them in the shower. we'll laugh about it later.I was joking with my husband yesterday about how sexy I look in my sports bra, bridget Jones big pants and surgical stockings. Hugs and best wishes for a speedy recovery. Carol",

      "Content": "hi everyone i'm Carol, I'm new to the site and only joined a couple of days ago. I have been diagnosed with cancer in my right breast and am due to have a mastectomy and reconstruction with a DIEP flap next Tuesday. I went for my Sentinel Node biopsy results today and they said they took three nodes and found cancer in one. It was a bit upsetting as i was hoping that there was no cancer in any of the lymph nodes but they said they will still do the reconstruction at the same time but to be sure they will remove all my lymph nodes at the same time. Hopefully, I won't need radiotherapy only chemo and therfore my new recon won't be affected although they don't know for sure. I know the recovery is quite long from this op but I was wondering if anyone had been through it and knows how long before you start feeling reasonably ok again and are able to get about. Also, when can you drive, i am in the country and hate the thought of being stuck in and not able to drive. I know my husband and kids will help but I like being independent so just wondered. Also, is swimming ok when you have healed. Sorry lots of questions. I'm feeling ok with occasional lapses when I have a good cry. Love and hugs to everyone going through cancer treatment. Just stay happy and positive. Carol X                                ",
