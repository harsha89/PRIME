      "Content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m having a few issues in finding the right prosthesis and wondered if anyone had had a similar issue. It seems that the fuller breasted women that are catered for are also wide in the chest, (which I\u2019m not!) The prosthesis I am currently wearing is, quite frankly, a joke and I am hugely disappointed that this is apparently the best the NHS can offer me. It\u2019s taken 4 months of toing and fro ing to the orthotics dept to be left hugely disappointed and incredibly frustrated with a prosthesis I remove as soon as I walk through the front door. Has anyone had a similar issue, or would you be able to point me to some further assistance please? Many thanks in anticipation.",

My Mum would have found it incredibly amusing if I end up with a knitted prothesis as she could knit anything! Who knows, I might even get round to knitting one myself",
