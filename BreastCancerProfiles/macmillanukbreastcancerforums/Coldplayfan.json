    "Content": "Hi worried I've just finished the 6 week HOPE course and I'm so glad I went along. I was diagnosed with BC last February after a routine mammogram, so was very shocked as I didn't know I had a lump in my right breast. I opted for a full mastectomy and reconstruction. I had 3 rounds of FEC chemo but my oncologist stopped after the 3rd lot as it affected my hormones in that I couldn't function, extremely tired, crying all the time etc etc. I guess I've been lucky that I was able to stop the chemo and didn't need radiotherapy. I'm just living with the side effects of chemo, I think it's put me into menopause, the main symptoms being crying at the drop of a hat ( I'm on anti depressants for that!!), anxiety & worrying about everything under the sun. I've decided not to take tamoxifen due to the low percentage of recurrence versus side effects. I did go on it for a month and ended up with hot flushes which didn't stop when I stopped taking it Going on the HOPE course has given me tools to help with these symptoms. I was very sceptical about going but am so glad I did. Coincidentally the Â other ladies on the course had all had BC and were at varying stages of having completed their treatment. It was great having other people to talk to as they been through it as well. However sympathetic family and friends are they cannot possibly understand and I didn't want to worry them either. I'm due to go on the look good feel better course next month. I must say that I've been impressed with all the after care support I've received. I hope you enjoy the course as much as I did and that being back at work helps. I couldn't wait to get back to work it just helped me feel normal again being with my work friends, having a laugh and having a purpose. Xxx",
