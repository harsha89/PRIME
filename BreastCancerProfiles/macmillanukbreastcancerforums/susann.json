      "Content": "Hi Katrina We ARE alike arn't we? Certainly family wise. My Mother and brother live less than 3 miles away from me - and all I got was a 'Get Well' card. Havn't seen either of them in years, so you're not alone there. I've some very good friends though! Yes, I can understand completely being very careful what you say to your Dad, bless him. Having gone through what he did with your Mum, and now you diagnosed similarly, he must be finding it very difficult. I'm sure you've reassured him  that treatments have improved a lot in recent years. Don't be too confident either, petal, of achieving targets that you're setting for yourself. I thought I was out of the woods when I last mailed you. My mindset has so changed, in that I now want to do SO much, but my energy levels have suprised me in being so low still. I think its going to take so much longer than I thought to get back to any kind of normality. But that's OK. It's all part of the plan. At the moment, at this stage in your life, YOU'RE the most important person. So take it easy, and love yourself. susann",

      "Content": "Hi Katrina I know I'm coming to this rather late, but I was so sad to read your post. The saddest part for me, was reading that you're trying to protect your family - \"as you don't want them to worry\" I think what you need, specially at a time like this, is to protect yourself, rather than others- and the best way you can do that is by being true to yourself and your feelings. Without authenticity, we're just acting, and I'm sure your family and friends deserve more than that from you. Of course we all have various emotions while we're going through this horrendous treatment - why would we want to shy away from them. Please darling, share your feelings and emotions with those who care for you. You will feel SO much better! I was diagnosed with Triple Negative too, and have just completed my 6th and final chemo. Trust me - the next 2 will simply fly by . And as for wanting to be yourself again - you ARE still yourself - but going through a tough time. And these tough times will pass (only 2 more now, you're over the worst). When I came out of chemo for the last time, just 2 weeks ago, I could have punched the air. Its like being let out prison. Such a GREAT feeling. And you're nearly there darling! Thinking of you      susann",

      "Content": "To penibear I'm shortly to have a prophylactic mastectomy, with no reconstruction, because for me, that's exactly what I want. You do have to say loud and emphatically what it is you DO want. Prophylactic mastectomies are not done so frequently, so your medical team need to hear you speak up. I had to, and it can often be the only way with this one. From what you say, you need to contact your breast care nurse to make you an appointment with the surgeon again. She will obviously ask you why. When I told mine what I now wanted, she was very dismissive, but made the appointment anyway. Just make sure that YOU are sure, your reasons are explained, and that the surgeon hears that! If by any chance the surgeon is unwilling to perform this surgery for you, ask for a referral for a second opinion, but I'm sure you won't need it! susann",

My Oncologist tells me that he thinks radiotherapy will be 'unlikely'!  He'd better make his mind up, 'cos my last chemo's on Friday (hurrah!). Are you able to share your thought processes regarding your decision to chemo or not? Thoughts are with you, pet. susann",

      "Content": "Having initially got over the shock of having Triple Neg, I began a treatment plan of chemo, which between my oncologist and myself we felt was 'as good as it got!' This was to be 3 x FEC and 3 x Docetaxel. After the first 3 FEC s, I had the first Docetaxel, and was extremely ill, but I had been warned that it was pretty heavy stuff. Unfortunately, just after the initial expected side effects were wearing off, my hands became extremely sore.....to the point a day or two later, of being burnt.......from the inside out! Returning to hospital, my rings were cut off, and was on medication for the burning. My oncologist was not prepared to continue with the Docetaxel - he said that was an allergic reaction, and next time, sheets of skin could be affected. So my last 2 chemo's are now back to the FEC. I'd love to hear from anyone with T.N. with their experiences, and the type of chemo they've had. I have one more FEC to come, and with that, I guess I can now start thinking about what lies ahead. Statistically, I know, for the first 5 years, we're at a pretty high risk of secondaries (maybe 30% or so) . How are you girls getting on with this outlook? I guess coming now to the end of my chemo, I'm starting to think about 'What Now?' susann",

      "Content": "Hi Pam Well I've done the surgery, the chemo, the radiotherapy and am now having tests for any cancer spread before I have a prophylactic mastectomy. Completely my choice, and am hoping this will wrap the whole thing up within the year. Having only been diagnosed in March, you're well away, although I guess you don't think think so. It seem you're diary is just FULL of hospital appointments. The way I saw it was that the cancer had been removed in the surgery, and then did everything I could to get on with my life. Although for me this has meant a completely different life, cos I've taken medical retirement, I'm 58. The chemo's pretty tough going isn't it? But its all downhill after that. Like you, though, I'm now waiting for the results of my bone scan again, and I must admit, my body's gone into shock again. I don't find this bit easy to deal with. Check out that American site for more info. They really are well informed. Good luck, susan x",
