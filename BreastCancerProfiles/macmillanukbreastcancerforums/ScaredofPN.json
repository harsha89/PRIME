      "Content": "Welcome to the group, I can appreciate how difficult this is for you right now. I was in the same place with my wife (35) at the end of March. The waiting for results and not knowing is awful. We ended up waiting twice, as they hadn't got all the test results back the first time. Please don't Dr Google, I drove myself to serious anxiety Googling and ended up at the GP and being prescribed anxiety meds. They will use the size of what they have found + biopsy results and lymph results to decide what the treatment plan looks like. From the biopsy sample they may test whether this has receptors (typically they will test for ER, PR, HER2) to help guide what treatment will look like. This forum is great and also the Macmillan helpline. You don't have to be the patient to call. I called them when my wife was well into treatment and wished I'd spoken to them sooner. Sending hugs and comfort, you will both get through this and out the other side.",

      "Content": "Hello, Is it normal to start losing hair again four weeks after finishing chemo (FEC-T, 3xFEC then 3xDocetaxel with Herceptin)? Most hair loss happened after cycle 1 (FEC) but now, four weeks after the last Doctaxel, hair is falling out again (after swimming)! Has anyone else experienced this? Did your hair grow back normally afterwards?",

However, because of the length and the fact it was summer she found the wig very hot and it was not easy to hairclip back like her normal hair.Â  In hindsight she would have selected something shorter which didn't get in her face.",
