      "Content": "Hey Jools Thanks so much for replying. I guess it is a little hard for me as I live in Holland and conselling is a problem with the language barrier. I understand your reasons totally for testing but I never plan on having children so I guess I just need to decide if I want to avoid the risk of ovarian cancer and I think from what I understand a positive brac test could help me make that decision. Did you consider this at all? Also Mum is 68 so from an age group I am not sure if it would help her to know if I was postive or not as even if she went for a test she is already in a risky group so maybe it makes no difference to her. I have no sister only an older brother. Sorry I ask this to you but I would so much appreciate thoughts from someone else who has been through this decision making process. Thanks again for replying. What were your results in the end and how did you feel if you do not mind me asking.... Clemmie",

I am finding so hard to make a decision as there are so many emotional choices not just the practical ones and I am also concerned about how to deal with discussing this with my family.",
