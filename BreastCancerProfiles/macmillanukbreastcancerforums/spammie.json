      "Content": "Hi all, Im finally admitting I'm not as strong as I thought I was, by asking for help.  Problem is I'm a do-er and a helper which means I very rarley ask for advice myself. I have copied and pasted this message from the new users group so if your are reading it again my apologies. I was diagnosed with left breast cancer and had left therapeutic mammoplasty in May and just recovering from left axillary clearance of lymph nodes. Im due to start chemo on 12 July. I am sure you will think i'm a horrible person but I feel the need to do this away from husband who I feel is suffocating me.  I left my husband last year for 6 months as he was having a midlife crisis and broke me emotionally. He persuaded me to come home as he has \"changed\" and still loves me. Some things have changed but there are so many things that I do not like about him still and am not in love with him. Then my diagnosis came which was earth shattering as I had decided I needed to have a life on my own and was planning my future, now everything has changed. He sees my cancer as a way of showing me how much he loves me and caring for me is to repay me for the upset he caused me for over past three years. I just want to be on my own and don't know where to turn. My sanity is leaving me rapidly, is there any one out there who may have some advice",

      "Content": "Hi Helen Its such a comfort to know there is someone dealing with cancer and the anxiety of a relationship that is broken and trying to get it back on track. I suppose we have to be selfish and mend ourselves first then see if the relationship is truly what we want.  I too went through counselling which helped, up until now my husband has refused couples councilling as he doesnt want to drag up the past!!  Ostrich/Sand come to mind. I've been home for six months now and feel as though we are co-habitting friends which is a terrible way to discuss a relationship after 27 years. Im a romantic and think that there should be a flutter in your heart when youre with your life partner, my flutter has not returned :-( I will definitely stay in touch, I have my first Chemo 12th July, have a lovely weekend xx",

      "Content": "Advice please, I have a very good friend who Is an associate professor in reconstructive plastic surgery in Berlin. I got in touch with him recently because I have a horrible infection in my wound under my arm now for over 3 weeks, have been hospitalised twice and hopefully now on way to recovery. He knows my medical history inside and out.  In May I had a therapeutic mammoplasty to remove a 21mm grade 3 invasive ductal cancer, I have since had left axillary node clearance with only one node affected. My dliema is that I had a mammogram in August 2013, my results came back clear. In March 2014 i discovered my lump. During my discussion my surgeon friend believes that given the size of the tumour it should have been visable on the mamogram taken last year and would like to see the films and the ones taken when cancer was confirmed. I believe that my outcome with treatment etc.. would probably have been the same even if it was discovered last year and do not want to play the blame game. However my concern is whoever viewed my mammogram may have missed my tumour, therefore how many other ladies out there who's films were asessed by this person may have been misinterpreted.  Their may be ladies who had clear mammograms who may actually have breast cancer. Do I ask for the films, I have just started chemo, now delayed twice due to infection and have six months of treatment ahead of me and risk creating a rift with the team treating me?",

      "Content": "Thanks Katharine, Its a hard one to call, I just worry that there may be someone out there thinking all is ok and early diagnosis is so important. I was 48 when I had my Mammogram too.  If anything is to be learned by our experiences  its imperitive to keep checking your breasts and not leaving it to modern technology. I was told during my ultrasound that all looked perfectly normal!! My tumour was only found by ultrasound because I insisted the lump was there, and literally pushed her hand to the lump. I have been advised not to ask the hospital to re-check films, but to get hold of the films for someone independant to view, so as you say it may be a hard task. I hope you get the answers you are looking for, i'll let you know how I get on Best wishes for the rest of your treatment, I'm following you hopefully 2nd FEC this weekend if I get the green light Pam",

      "Content": "I didn't mention in my previous post the NHS Trust treating me  Today I made the decision to write to the The Chief Executive Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust outlining my concerns as I am one of their patients. Last week it was reported nationally that thirty women in Oxfordshire are to be reassessed for breast cancer after five patients developed the disease following screening by the same doctor. They were identified by Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust after a review of the 626 women seen between 2011 and 2014. I believe it is important to seek the truth as there may be women totally unaware that they may have breast cancer, I truly hope that it is not the tip of the iceberg.",
