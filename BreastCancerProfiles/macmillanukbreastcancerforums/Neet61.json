Bit frightened...I'm not a control freak, but suddenly almost all of my life is out of control, and I don't know whether Tamoxifen is responsible, but I'm emotionally all over the place! I'm blaming the hormones!",

My pre chemo check was really helpful: weight, down(!) height, no change yet and blood. Then a talk about the FEC bit of the FEC-T, whether I want to try a cold cap- anyone out there had a go? Went through the side effects and then a visit to the treatment room and my first visit will be to reclining chair number 5 on the 10th March.  Sounds so spa like... So there's a few of us here, on the starting blocks love and hugs to all Neet",
