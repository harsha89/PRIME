      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. I dont have to have chemo but do have to have radiotherapy.  I m not sure regarding refunds yet but I will talk to my breast nurse.  I have travel insure through my bank but i haven't even thought about that yet. Also I havent advised my bank/insurance or my life insurance about cancer yet but I suppose it's something I should do.  My gut is saying it's a risk and I should try and go later in the summer. My head is saying i really want to go on holiday!!  What i have learnt is nothing us straightforward with cancer!!! Happy Easter x",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, My first time on here. I am having right breast DIEP next month but have a holiday booked in July. It is a festival type holiday in Croatia which includes a lot of dancing and is a whole lot of fun. However it is 9 weeks after my surgery. I am thinking I should probably cancel. I am not staying on festival site so could probably play it down but would I be able to go in the sea etc??? Look forward to any help.",
