It was good news!!!!  Now for the longer answer. I rang to check biopsy results were back as instructed, and she told me then that they didn't show any malignant changes and I didn't need to go in. A big cheer went up in the office, as by then the 4 of them who were there knew I was waiting as I was such a bundle of nerves in the morning. The doctor gave me a call later just to confirm the result. She said it didn't specifically say it's a fibroadenoma but that's what she thinks it is by its appearance and that I'll have another routine mammogram in 3 years. Don't need to tell you all, as I'm sure you can guess, how relieved I was. I think I'd convinced myself it would be bad news. I can't thank you enough for your short-term support and I wish you all the luck in the world with whatever you're currently facing. I'm hoping to do a 26 mile walk in the summer for a breast cancer charity and a testicular cancer. I'll be thinking of you all. Now, back to sorting out all the clutter in my house that I've been meaning to do for years ......",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. What a lovely supportive group you are! I went for a first routine mammogram a couple of weeks ago aged 49. Got a recall letter a week later for an appointment at our local breast clinic. Slight feeling of panic when the realisation hit that cancer was a possibility but I managed to keep my mind off it (mind you, it made me realise the house needed a good tidy up and sort out!). Husband came with me to the centre but I went in for the mammogram and then to see the doctor on my own as I know a bit about the process and realised that at worst I'd end up having an ultrasound and biopsy - but really thought it would turn out to just be a fuzzy bit on the initial mammogram. The glowing white lump that greeted me from the scan on the screen made me realise I was going to be there a bit longer! The ultrasound showed it wasn't a cyst so she took two biopsy samples and I've got to go back on Tuesday for the results. She said \"Try not to lose any sleep over this. I'd be really surprised if it isn't a fibroadenoma\". It's quite smooth on one side but a bit diffuse on the other which makes me slightly suspicious. She scanned my lymph nodes too and they look fine which was reassuring because by now I was already thinking about all my aches and pains and what might be going on. I came away from the appointment feeling quite reassured despite seeing the lump, but as the days are ticking by I'm feeling more and more sick. My husband's very supportive but feels like I usually do - \"No point worrying until you know there's something to worry about\". One of my grown up sons lives at home now and vet student daughter is staying here for a couple of weeks while she's on a local work placement and I haven't told them, so we haven't really talked about it. Hubby's now gone abroad until Friday so he can't come with me for the results. Best friend can't come due to work, so I've roped in a friend from work who didn't work on a Tuesday - bless her! I haven't got any family history but went to a friend's funeral recently who was diagnosed when I worked with her about 8 years ago (same age as me), lost 2 other friends in the last couple of years to BC and have 2 others recently successfully treated, so it all feels a bit real. Fortunately I'm friends with a lovely lady who used to work for one of the breast surgeons so she's great to talk to and said if it comes to it, she'll come with me to see him, but fingers crossed that wine be necessary. I'm already feeling a bit calmer having written all of this down. It's probably not going to be cancer, and if it is, it's probably well-treatable, but I can't help these panicky feelings that keep welling up inside me. Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading if you made it to the end! I wish you all lots of luck with what you're going through. xxx",
