    "Content": "I'm got a few headcovers from annabandana as well, they are nice, comfy and affordable. Simplywigs do have a very good quality stuff but they are a bit more pricy, love wearing their woolen hats and a swim cap is lovely.  Suburbanturban has some beautiful  looking summer hats but they are much more expensive, haven't justified to buy any from them yet... I might. Good luck! ",
