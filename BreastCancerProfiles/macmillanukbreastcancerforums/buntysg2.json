      "Content": "Hi KJ   What you are feeling is very natural .  You have gone from being a person of high priority to another survivor.  I can understand how you fell I went through the same feeling of being at loss , what do I do, now , is it all over?  It is like being cast adrift.  I can assure you it will pass.  The timing will be different for everyone.  I took some time off work after all my treatment, and my Gp was wonderful, he asked me to tell him when I was ready for work, and continued to give me sick notes which helped take off some of the pressure. The suggestion to talk to your GP is correct, he may even help plan out a slow return to what ever is your 'normal'. Love and Hugs to you   Bunts          ",
