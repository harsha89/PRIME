      "Content": "Hi Again Tracey   Listen you are allowed to be emotional, personally going for a drive and screaming in the car helps me, but crying is good too! As with everything we use time as a marker and as you are coming up to a year it IS going to be a difficult time! Try to change the negative thoughts to positive if you can, e,g, this mammogram will show you are still cancer free and help you move into the next year with extra  hope etc (easy to say I know) I read below someone say you are normally positive well me too, but you are only human and it is bound to get to you sometimes. Surround yourself with good people, love, laugh and if all else fails ..... get drunk, scream, cry shout and then start laughing again!   Joanna,xx",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey Oh it is hard being a single Mum and cancer on top you are a very strong lady! A cuddle is always good, it is amazing what a little human contact can do! I am Struggling with keeping positive myself at the moment as I have a virus and I am so tired, but I keep on trying to smile and laugh on through and trying to get fit n healthy! Determined to up my activity next week, back to swimming and maybe yoga which I haven't done for ages. My dog keeps me out walking so at least I get some activity and fresh air! I go easy on my self for a while when I am low and then give myself a slap and get back up and on!   I really hope and pray all goes well for you, Good luck   Joanna  ",
