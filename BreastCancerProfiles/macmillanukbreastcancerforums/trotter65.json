      "Content": "I have had 2 FEC chemo's so far and like you absolutely hate it - I feel as though I have been poisoned - which is exactly what is happening! However there is no way I could have got up, dressed and gone to work 2 days later! I have spent best part of a week in bed after each treatment mainly sleeping. However on day 7 I wake up and feel like my old self again. I work from home and I don't even attempt to do anything until day 9 or 10 and even then I rest quite a lot. I think you are being too tough on yourself. Also on FEC we are at most risk of infection around day 8 or 9 so I tend to keep away from public places until day 12. I then feel pretty good until it starts all over again. Please look after yourself - and don't give up!!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Jo,  My pre-assessment mainly consisted of the nurse running through  the chemo drugs and their potential side effects and me signing the consent form. The only benefit to me really was the reality check that came with seeing all the people sitting in the chairs 'ticking ' away.  Good  luck for tomorrow and make sure  that you  take all the anti-sickness meds that they give you! Be prepared to spend most of the next 5 days sleeping.  Julie",
