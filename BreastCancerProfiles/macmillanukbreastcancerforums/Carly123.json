    "Content": "Hi, I had my first cycle of FEC-T and started being sick about 2 hours later. The sickness didn't stop and ended up spending 2 days in hospital! The anti sickness meds made no difference at all and I stopped taking them. My head was just too sore to continue! They re going to give me a stronger anti sickness med next time (amend) so fingers crossed!",
