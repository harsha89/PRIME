      "Content": "Hi jsj.  Sorry to hear your diagnosis.   I had a lumpectomy 3 months ago and have been wearing non-wired crop tops ever since. I find them really comfortable, they give support and are soft against the skin. A well known High Street store sells a pack of 2 for £14. I also wore tops that opened down the front for the first couple of weeks as they were easy to get on and off when I didn't have full movement in my arm. Hope your treatment goes well. You will find this site really useful if you have any more questions. Margaret x",

      "Content": "Hi Phaedra I, like you, was not happy about taking bisphosphonates because of the side effects you mention.  I did take them for 5 weeks then told my GP that I would rather not continue with them.  His offered alternatives but said that, at the end of the day, being healthy is about being happy and if I was not happy taking them then he understood my decision. I am doing lots of bone strengthening exercise and if my next DEXA scan shows further bone density loss I might think again. I have a 10% chance of a severe fracture so think I will be very careful in this icy weather! Hope you can  make a decision that is right for you. Margaret x",

A wonderful resource to have on my doorstep and ladies travel many miles to use it. Margaret x",
