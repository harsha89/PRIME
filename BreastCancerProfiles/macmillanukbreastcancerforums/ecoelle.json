      "Content": "Hi,  i am in exactly the same position as you, wasn't sure if i was allowed to join the forum as i haven't been diagnosed with anything as of yet.   I felt a lump on 31st October and got in to see the GP on Friday, he said he could feel 2, 1 at 2cm and another at 1/2cm referred me straight away, had a letter from the doctors on Saturday to say my app at the breast unit at the hospital will be on Monday 12th.  So maybe we could support each other?    Do you know when your appointment is yet to be seen?  I haven't had the info from the hospital yet so i don't know what tests they will do.   I hope for both of us the outcome is a good one:)",

      "Content": "I'm in the midlands.   I decided to tell my  husband and my parents as i need their support, my mum is going to have our daughter while we go to the hospital appointment.  Didn't really want to take her with us as i'm not sure what will happen at the appointment and i don't want anything to frighten her.  Did your doctor tell you what happens at the hospital?    I totally understand you not wanting to tell people, i'm going to have to make something up to get the time off work, but at the same time make sure you have support:)    I think the hospital have to see you within 2 weeks of the referral, i got really scared that the appointment came quick so it must be cancer, but apparently they always see anyone with a breast lump within 2 weeks.  Where abouts are you?",

      "Content": "Evening Kate,   Well, been at work today, had to tell my boss about needing some time off on Monday.  He was fine, i didn't have to tell him why, just said i would need to leave early as I'd had a hospital app come through for some tests.  He was fine with that, I'm very lucky to have such an understanding boss and friend.  I think he knows me well enough to know that if i ask for time off then it's important...he probably thinks I'm pregnant again:)   Hope your day has been ok, did your app come through yet?  I hope you have managed to find someone to confide in in person, as i know virtual friends and hugs are good, but they don't beat the real thing.  My husband who you asked about is doing ok i think.  He's been a bit quiet today, also i've been quite short tempered with him, but he's been so patient with me.    Cornwall eh?  I love Cornwall, we have friends who live on The Lizard, lucky gits!  Sometimes i wish i lived more rurally, but i think i would miss the big city.    Hugs coming your way, feel free to waffle!   x",
