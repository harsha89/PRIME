      "Content": "Yes I had this news this week too ! I had a lumpectamy at about the same time as you and new from the surgeon that although the lymph nodes looked clear one was so close to the tumour it may well show up on histopathology which it did. The next nearest node only had two cancer cells in and the other four were clear Due for a clearance op on 11th Dec. Getting rest of results next week but have told surgeon if he'[s going in again I'd rather go for a masectomy to reduce recurrance chances. I too haven't healed and am just getting over an infection. Ended up in A and E this morning as loads of fluid coming out of wound. Anyway getting on with the xmas shopping on the internet this year! Take care",

      "Content": "Hi Lizzie, I had my first chemo TAC which containd Docetaxel yesterday and have had no side effects yet apart from change of taste. It appears if you drink loads of fluids and take all the sickness pills this does reduce your chances of sickness and side effects. I'm still keeping my fluid intake high now. I was really terrified at the prospect and was changing my mind continually over the weekend. In fact cos they still hadn't called me till 50 mins after my appointment time I lost my bottle told my husband I'd changed my mind and legged it. He came and found me after having a few  words with them ! Still the administration of the drugs went ok and wasn't really scary and today I've been able to walk the dogs, do a supermarket shop and cook the meal as usual. It may be a false dawn and I may be in a heap tommorrow but so far so good. I know I'm going to lose my hair , not sure if your drugs will, but chose my wig last wig and am actually really pleased with it - it takes 15 years off me - no grey bits, nice and thick etc !!   Take care and good luck Jo",

      "Content": "I have been told today that my lumpectamy histopathology results have been delayed for a week. Nurse said it was because wire guided lumpectamies take longer but as she had not mentioned this at  the time I don't really believe her. With the delay it will be 3 weeks. I'm thinking of asking to read my notes. Anyone been in a sinmilar position?",

      "Content": "We were told you could have a copy of the action plan you agreed if you wanted one. I saw it when I was in A&E and it gave a couple of sentance sum up of your tumour, then the treatment they proposed and any concerns you'd expressed. About a side of A4 in total. There is also a sign up in cancer unit saying they write to your GP at various points of your treatment and that if you ask you can have a copy of these letters. I'm sure if you ask your hospital will have something similar, but having read mine in A&E I'm not sure I'd want a copy in the house in case the kids found it. It somehow made it all a bit too brutal seeing it in black and white and thinking thats me  thats refering too!, but I think its available if you want it. Jo",

      "Content": "Has anyone else had chest pains or a change to their heart rhythmn during TAC or other chemo? I subsequently had further chest pains and ended up being CT scanned for a possible pulmonary embolism. Fortunatly this was negative but as I have read you can have long term probs with your heart after chemo and my next chemo is tuesday - I'm not sure what to do. One nurse suggested the pain could be coming from the operation site as healing takes months but nobody seems to be planning to find out for sure before the next chemo. I'n not sure whether to have it or not. Anyone had a similar experience?",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Its reassuring to know its not that unusual. The subsequent heart pains were a few days after chemo when my neutrophils were 0.0 ( a tad low !) so probably my red cells were low too. After I had posted this I had a call from my Breast Care nurse (still working at 6.15 what would we do without them) with an appt to see the oncologist tomorrow to talk it all through and examine the painful breast. They feel it prob was anaemia and chemo annoying the wound but are going to check everything over which is very reassuring. If I pick up any gems of info as to signs that mean panic or don't panic I'll post them ! cheers again Jo",
