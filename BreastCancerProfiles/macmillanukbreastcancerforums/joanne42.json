    "Content": "Hi there   I think what your mum is getting is a sentinal node biopsy the same as me I had this year ago april there is no more pain than an normal injection she will have the radiation injection about 2 hours before op the dye during op Ill warn you now she will be slightly blue when she comes round from her op I looked liked mama smurf fpor a day much to the amusement of my kids. I still have a sligt tringe of blue on my boob so tell her not to worry it does fade but considering the alternative of getting more nodes tken away with the risk of lymphodema i think this is small price to pay i can assure you and your mum that its not sore in the least.   joanne",
