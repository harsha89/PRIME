    "Content": "Hi, you do sound so scared and i feel for you so much. Not being given the info that would have enabled you to make the right choice for you is pants. If you have the treatment you might not get lymphodemia but your deep fear is telling you that you will, and i understand this. Whatever choices you make about your treatment is your choice and you should never be judged on this. We dont choose to be fearful,sometimes its just who we are, that person who at times cant deal with what life throws at us. We're not all strong, we all dont go in there with a battle plan and fighting can be so hard. Add in a underlying mental health ilness and boom things do become so overwhelming that all we can do is walk away. I take my hat off to you for your honesty and not hiding your fears. Keep strong xxx Arizona",
