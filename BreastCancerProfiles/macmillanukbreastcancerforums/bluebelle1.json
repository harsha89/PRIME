    "Content": "Well done you. I have had my three FEC and I am reading your postings to find out what awaits me with T. I love reading good news stories but the real experiences help you prepare yourself for the unexpected. I have realised Breast Cancer does take a year away from you but the treatment enables you to live and value what you have. Celebrating birthdays is a number one priority share and support those around you who were there for you. If any one can give me tips on T they will be greatly appreciated. Lin congratulations on completing your treatment the cancer is in the past look forward and cherish every moment with your loved onesÂ  Gx",
