Whatever they are though just keep a positive mind and remember that the hospital will do everything they can to help, advise and comfort you. Whatever happens it is not always the end of the world. Being positive is the only way. Good luck - let us know how you get on. x",

      "Content": "Hello Dianne.  Please don't be worried about radiotherapy.  There really is nothing to it - a bit like having a xx-ray except the machine moves around you. It doesn't hurt and you are only there a few minutes. The staff are monitoring you all the way on a screen just outside the room.  The after effects of radiotherapy differ from person to person.  It can make you feel tired at the end of treatment, you should bhe able to carry on working quite happily. I was fine all the way through. You are more likely to get side effects from your hormone pill than the radiotherapy. Just do everything they tell you to do - especially using the cream lavishly and using only certain deodorant/toiletry  products during the course of treatment.  I'm sure you'll be fine. Just relax. They usually have soft music playing in the background for you too. Good luck x",

Anyway they only leave you alone for a very few minutes and they are monitoring you all the time and would see immediately if there was a problem. Honestly youll be fine - it's just like having an x-ray. Good luck x",

      "Content": "Hello. I'm new to this site. Despite only being diagnosed with primary cancer I did have to have a mastectomy.  I finished radiotherapy at the beginning of May and can honestly say that during the sessions I had no problems at all. I too counted once the machine was on and found it made the session go quicker.I think 30 was the highest I got to.   Despite using the cream I did get quite a lot of discolouration which is only just fading now. To be honest it's the after effects of radiotherapy that are getting me down. Aching legs, tiredness and generally feeling low.  These are now gradually getting better and I'm assured will eventually go away altogether. However it's better than the alternative! Take care  ",

      "Content": "Hi Little Meg.  I'm new here and have only just read your post about joint pain.  Whilst I am so sorry you are having so much pain your post will shut me up from moaning about my comparatively minor aches and pains.  I didn't have chemo, just radiothereapy and now taking Arimidex. My BCN told me that it is the medication that causes the joint pain. I must say that, apart from my knees, things are not as painful as at first. On the tonic water subject - a friend of mine was advised to drink it daily as she had pains in her hand following an op for carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's the quinine in it that has pain relieving qualities. I do hope things improve for you soon. x",
