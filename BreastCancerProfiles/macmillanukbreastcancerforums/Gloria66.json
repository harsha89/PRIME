      "Content": "Hi Eden.  I'm just coming to the end of 18 Taxol treatments.  I lost my hair but found chemo manageable.  If you are in Bromley check out the Primrose centre - they have really helped me.  I'm in Beckenham so if you want to meet up for coffee let me know.  Good luck for Thursday.  I didn't get on with the cold cap but people who did say - take a thick hair band and take some painkillers beforehand.",

As well as three goes via Porto cath it took 5 attempts to get blood out of different veins.  It took 2.5 hours just to get my bloods done today.",

I didn't use a cold cap and had my hair cut into a short style due to scalp pain.  It hurt for another day and I was planning on having it shaved but pain now gone so will just wait. In on 4/18 of Packitaxol.",
