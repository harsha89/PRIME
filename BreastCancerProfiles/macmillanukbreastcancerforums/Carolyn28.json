      "Content": "cheers Kacang  I'll have a read okay well that is quite comforting for those choosing to, or being strongly advised to, be treated with chemotherapy but it is just dealing with death in the first 30 days. It doesn't deal with long term side effects and the emotional effects or relationship stresses which we know happen more around chemotherapy than surgery alone for cancer patients.  The Predict Tool uses long term studies on substantial groups of women, some of whom must choose not to have chemo for primary early stage breast cancers, I was told that due to confidentiality I couldn't talk to any of those women, which is a little frustrating, I'd like to have real women talking about their decisions after 5 and 10 years anyway Predict is to allow both health professionals and patients to check the statistics  I still don't think everyone needs to have chemotherapy, i do think it is over used, the NHS thinks it's overused but guidelines say to offer it in borderline cases. using 70 as the age, routine screening, 20mm tumour, grade 2 and no lymph involvement, ER+ Her2- \"Five year survival 90 out of 100 women are alive at 5 years with no adjuvant therapy after surgery  An extra 1 out of 100 women treated are alive because of hormone therapy  An extra 2 out of 100 women treated are alive because of hormone therapy & chemotherapy\" personally I just don't think chemo is worth the risk in this scenario, in fact I'm not sure I'd even take the hormone therapy  NB  this is a estimate without correct information other than the age xx Carolyn",

      "Content": "hi Ronnie47  welcome to the online community, sorry you've had to come and find us it's always going to be a tricky decision for people like us to make because we have no experience or expertise have you been shown the Predict tool? you need to input your age at diagnosis , which you have given us, but you also need size of the lump and whether lymph nodes are involved http://predict.nhs.uk/predict_v2.0.html I tentatively put some 'average' values in to test it and chemo doesn't offer much benefit to you at your age Chemotherapy carries a risk and we seem to have adopted 3% because one lady's  oncologist was adamant that that was correct but I have heard 5% used That means that unless you can see a clear 5% benefit using the Predict tool putting your body (and mind) through chemo isn't worth it, the risks outweigh the benefits.  For me the uplift in stats was something like 25-30% so I was persuaded , I'm 55 now but was 52 at the time of diagnosis . hope that helps a bit ?

      "Content": "hi Mighty Mouse  someone else was saying that their surgeon needed needlework training, their seams weren't up to much, and I must admit my first mastectomy scar was so horrific I cried, it looked like I'd been in a terrible accident rather than a carefully planned operation. The implant was also too large but we've sorted that now and my scar is much better. I didn't have a diep so not really sure what to say to expect but one thing I will say is that mine did take an age to settle down. I had the surgery in July '15 and what with the seroma and part of the scar not closing properly, it didn't really settle until just before the revision surgery in March '16. Patience is a virtue. It took me a few months to be able to look at myself critically in the mirror but I've taken my fake boob to a few beaches now and it doesn't attract any attention. Almost all the surgeons I've spoken to are really painfully aware how critical we are, it's not just vanity, and I do believe they want us to be delighted with their efforts at reconstructing us after our cancer diagnosis, we want to appear as 'normal' as possible and be able to look at ourselves in the mirror, not just flaunt ourselves for others. I think my case was a little easier for me to deal with as I didn't have to put up any kind of fight or argument to get the revision surgery, they'd manage to miss a 15mm tumour during the mastectomy, really should have gone to specsavers, and were duty bound to go back in and retrieve what was left of it after chemo, which also gave them a chance to improve the scar. But don't feel bad, you are well within your rights to demand an improvement in aesthetics. Carolyn x",

When I was first diagnosed all I could find, even on here, was that I had a 50-50 chance of making it to the 5 and 10 years bench marks. I didn't want chemo but my oncologist persuaded me and that improved my stats to 80% so I could dwell on the 20% or I can focus on the 80% It has taken me a long time but I am finally able to keep my fears to a minimum, I got my diagnosis in May 2015 so I have really longed it out, laboured the point and wallowed in quite a lot of self pity.

Nobody would view diabetes as a terminal illness today, you have a chronic condition which can be managed with insulin therapy. This is how we need to begin to see cancer.  Not all cancers but certainly some, probably some breast cancers. How are you feeling about things now ?

I had an MRI scan but, unusually, it was reviewed by two radiologists, one found the clue to my actual tumour and one didn't.  I had a large area of DCIS, 75mm,  but no node or nodule was found initially. However, before surgery my node presented itself as a lump in my chest, it literally popped up overnight. According to the poster for self diagnosis it felt more like a broad bean than a lemon pip, therefore a lymph node rather than a tumour but it was agreed that a mastectomy would remove everything in any case. Turns out it didn't. I'm not sure where you live but the Royal Marsden has a rapid diagnostic unit and they put me through again as a new patient, then they found it. So yes, WELL WORTH a second opinion/ second look/ alternate perspective. I'm surprised you had to push for a CT scan, once the oncology team got hold of me they put me through bone and CT scans, to be sure what they were dealing with. happy to share more detail if you need it C",

I found a lump under my right arm and have had the ultrasonographers look at it several times but it is apparently nothing to be alarmed about, I just don't believe them. I'm still alarmed. As long as you can stay calm about the various procedures you can get through it, if you're shaking with fear it makes hitting the target really tricky. Teaching hospitals really like patients like you, they probably just like experimenting on your cells. I though my  high grade DCIS would be fascinating, nobody really knows much about the exact transition from DCIS to IDC but apparently it is the triple negative ones that everyone gets excited about. stay clam and have a glass of champagne to alleviate fear, my GP laughed at me because I said i felt like the Titanic, I felt I was sinking fast, he said, don't be daft, you're not sinking, if you want to use that analogy, you have a small hole, it's above the waterline and all your pumps are still working. x x x hugs",

That is , of course , a very long term , black and white picture. It doesn't allow for my 28 year old, who doesn't live at home, to have any cash when I die.

      "Content": "hi Jo we also have it in the family so I was resigned to it at some point, although the GP said it's not inevitable if you keep your weight stable and don't overload on sugars. The key thing I learned during the last pregnancy, when I was checking my blood regularly (6 times a day in the first couple of weeks) was that the body averages out the values. I found that if I had a 3 course meal, even if I had ice cream as a dessert, my blood sugar wouldn't spike. So I checked and it's true, your body does average it out. Eating a variety of foods is key to stable blood glucose. A glass of orange juice on its own will cause a spike but a cheese sandwich on wholemeal or oatmeal bread and a glass of orange juice won't. A bowl of porridge and a glass of orange juice won't, three rashers of bacon and two fried eggs and a glass of orange juice won't. But you have to try it for yourself. I have seen various splits but 30% protein, 30% fats and 30% carbs would seem logical but probably hard to keep up, I'm sure most people average more like 50% carbs, 30% protein and 20% fats.  I'm going to do a little more digging on this ratio. It's too simplistic to say eat a low carb diet because it's relative isn't it, you may already not be eating many carbs. But you may be snacking on fruit, better to have cheese and fruit, or cheese on a ryvita type snack bread and a bit of fruit. How do you feel about investing in a blood sugar monitoring kit ? Boots do some for around 20 quid.  Personally I see very little value in a fasting glucose test now I've experienced the regular blood sugar monitoring alongside your regular meals. most kits have a finger pricker which is spring loaded and painless, a set of test strips, which are then purchased as a consumable so check they stock supplies,  and a gadget that beeps and gives you the reading. plus alcohol wipes.

I didn't actually have a problem with the chemo drugs. But the saline flush was awful, which didn't make sense, the local hospital flush didn't taste much of anything, just slightly salty, as you'd expect but then when I queried it the London team said the preloaded syringes had a preservative in it, goodness knows why saline needs a preservative but that was the issue, so they offered to use non preloaded ones especially for me but they did sometimes forget. Before we got to the bottom of it I took some sweets and just popped one in my mouth to mask the horrid taste. This sounds more of a challenge though. Obviously if we could trick you to take the medicine with sweets we'd be home and dry. The only thing I can think of is hypnotherapy. My PICC line solved my vein issue so much so that I practically skipped in for treatment. hugs Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "Rich1984  hi, I agree with Misty to a certain extent but I have met women that totally rely on their husbands, how independent is your wife ? I had EC and T, other women have FEC and T.  Everyone reacts differently.  Normally we're given anti-sickness meds and a steroid before the infusion, it varies but not by much across the UK. Then there's the 'goody bag' of meds to take home.  One of my friends relied on her husband to pretty much take over her care, now that's not something I'd do but in my marriage we're debating who's going to end up in prison for killing whom. I've been reliably informed that no jury would ever convict me, but the kids asked me not to so I've packed away the lead pipe and the candlestick. I'm sure my current husband would have relished the opportunity to finish me off if I'd allowed him access to the goody bag. However, the sickness meds did work for me, I had Ondansetron and was told to take one after a few hours, once the injection had worn off.  Other people prefer or have more luck with Emend. Getting the drugs right and in the right dose takes a bit of trial and error. Then there's the steroids , I had dexamethasone, as an injection before the infusion and tablets to take the next day. That was more than enough for me to cope with but then I was up at 3am with diarrhea and again at 4 ... and 5 and 6 ...  so I took some of the codeine I had left from my surgery and that helped.  Then I had to deal with constipation which is either tinned peaches or another drug, I think Dulcolax seemed to have been mentioned as the most reliable but prunes, plums or any stoned fruit are very good and avoids a drug overload. It's a lot to take in and nobody is going to condemn you for throwing up your arms in despair, just as long as you have a good wail then get a grip.  I had to make a list and re-read the leaflets that came with the drugs to feel I had actually understood what each was for and why. Like I said, other people just follow the doctors instructions or rely on their partner or carer. When you have a moment make a list of the 2 or 3 main things that are freaking you out and then call the helpline. I got through quite a few tissues when I called the first time but it did help.

      "Content": "hi candytop  I do sympathize, my first surgery scar refused to heal but I'd been given antibiotics as a precaution when they drained the seroma. I also asked about a powder because I am sure I remember the powder they gave me for the kids umbilical cords was an antibiotic product. That would have made a lot of sense to me but I'm thinking it may have fallen out of favour. There are plenty of medicated dressings available and I've just seen one with Manuka Honey in it, we've had a few discussions about the natural healing properties of that. I used Savlon dressings in the end, not that they really worked that well and they cost a fortune. After my second surgery my scar healed almost immediately and I had very little seroma. Keep pestering the team though, they really should be looking after you hugs Carolyn xx",

In the U.S. they do sometimes allow just the Herceptin but it's down to finance, if families don't have funds for both, although I expect that might have changed now since the Obama Care ? Anyway, it is what it is, in the UK they are only licensed to use the combination of taxanes and trastuzumab (Herceptin). Which apparently work very well together. For me I had a good result with EC (epirubicin cyclophosphamide) but not much that could be measured with docetaxel or paclitaxel and Herceptin. So you're triple positive, which is sort of good, because they can throw everything at you. Chemo sucks, let's be honest, I bet you didn't feel ill at all, most of us don't, but then wham, exhaustion to a whole new level. Despite that I managed my usual walk pretty much every day, about 5k and including a super steep hill,  and I definitely felt better for it, I pulled on a bobble hat but if the sun was out I'd wait until nobody was around and take it off for a few minutes to get some Vit D, I went through chemo from August to Christmas Eve last year, so mostly autumn / winter. I need to add a couple of success stories to the thread but yes, do keep positive, breast cancer is very treatable and in most cases curable. Carolyn x",

The only reason I know this is because I had low potassium on chemo and had to have 3 days worth of what looked and tasted like Alka Seltzer.  I said can't I just eat bananas, the nurse said you can but only after we've fixed it with these tablets. I then looked up foods rich in potassium, here is one reasonable article it gives you a clue, not extensive, about the functions potassium helps with.  The NHS web site does have information but only on overdose which is more likely to happen if you take supplements. I asked them to add in the deficiency information and they've added it to the list for next round of amends. Potassium even improves low moods. It's not just potassium though, there is a list of essential vitamins and minerals doing these kind of jobs in our bodies. beta-carotene boron chromium cobalt copper magnesium manganese molybdenum nickel phosphorus potassium selenium silicon sodium chloride (salt) sulphur zinc Carolyn xxx",

I had diarrhea caused by the drugs and constipation caused by the pain meds throughout.   It was a constant juggling act. On balance I'd say constipation was the worst of the two evils, trying to pass a house brick isn't fun. But there are solutions. I found DHC or Dihydrocodeine, suited me better for the pain and the diarrhea and I could get away with eating plums or peaches to alleviate the worst of the constipation, rather than attempt to drink the drain unblocker the GP prescribed. I can't comment on the 'after 4' you will have to chat with your oncologist about your thoughts and feelings. I was told that Her2+ is sneaky and quite likely to recur and I should do as much as I can to avoid it, even though there's no guarantees it works 100%, they wouldn't listen to my pleas to avoid chemo all together and then it's, in for a penny in for a pound, isn't it. They might agree to reduce the dose ? Having the EC and the T in different phases definitely gave me two distinct side effects. The bone pain on T was incredible, my left shin specifically and my poor feet.  But they took pity on me and gave me Lorazepam, which did help.

      "Content": "hi mossom2  I had EC and T with Herceptin and it was a marathon, the 4 x EC started on August 17th 2015, every three weeks and then switched to accelerated T every two weeks but slotting the Herceptin in every 3 weeks around it. The T phase finished Christmas Eve 2015, on schedule and the Herceptin continued until November 2016. My oncologist explained to me, several times, why she had prescribed the regime, she was treating me as stage 3,  and I trusted her to treat me. But she also said that if I felt I couldn't cope she could reduce the doses. She also didn't use the F part of the FEC treatment as she felt it wasn't necessary. A lot of women are still treated with FEC T. Opinions do seem to vary and thinking has changed a bit even in 12 months and some oncologists recommend Perjeta and Herceptin together but I have a feeling that is for neoadjuvant chemotherapy but TCHP seems to be widely used now. Whether an oncologist prefers one type of regime or another seems to be down to where and with whom they studied and qualified, what their current peer group are recommending and what their own personal experiences have been . The chemo effect is cumulative, I asked for my blood reports each time and it did show a steady decline but it never got past the critical point where I had to take a break . So, you are right in thinking that the longer you have to endure the assault on your system the higher the risk but I know a couple of people who reacted most strongly after the first round and then didn't suffer as badly in subsequent rounds. The only real way to decide is to chat to your team, I was lucky in that my onco was kind and patient. Like I said, mine was quite willing to lower the T dose but I decided to stick with it, having got that far it made sense to give it the full works. Which side effects are bothering you most ? There are lots of remedies. hugs Carolyn xx",

It does sometimes seem our bodies conspire against us in excruciatingly embarrassing ways but I'm sure most of the time nobody else is aware. I really hope that you get some investigations done with some results so that you can put your mind at rest, I really hope it's nothing to worry about but even if it is cancer there's surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, hormonal therapies and radiotherapy, my son will be 30 in July, it seems only yesterday he was that tiny baby / mischievious toddler / truculent teenager ... I can't imagine what you went through  If it helps at all, I'm thinking of you and hoping for the best with your health x x  x x x x x x Carolyn",

Once you are breastfeeding there is the risk that the wires could press into your breast tissue and cause a blockage. logic tells me that blocked ducts and ductal carcinoma may be linked ... the blockages in ducts during pregnancy and feeding/nursing are largely calcium deposits or calcifications ...  sound familiar ? So why are the popular press and charities telling us that underwired bras have nothing to do with breast cancer ??? I have now switched away from underwires for everyday use not sure what to do for my next beach holiday, but am guessing that lessening the dependency on them is a step in the right direction hugs to all Carolyn xx",

Depending on the level of pain, you have options.  If you think it's okay and manageable then wait until Tuesday.  If it gets worse suddenly, the pain is off the scale and doesn't get better call 999.  If it's anywhere in between you have the 111 service or your medical unit out of hours team. It is tricky to know when to act and women are particularly bad at looking after themselves, we always seem to say \"it'll be fine\" Sepsis is a real threat, so are blood clots. Any pain is your body telling you that something isn't right. You are undergoing chemotherapy, nobody is going to condemn you for getting checked out.   I called my local A&E to see how many germ infested ill people were there, just in case I felt I needed to go in, thankfully I didn't but they offered a side door away from the general coughs and colds and broken limbs Carolyn xx",

Really painful, stops you in your tracks. I'm not sure why I think it's linked to that ... Why can't it be linked to chemo ?  I had plenty of bone pain in the T phase, they warned me about it. They gave me oramorph which is fine as a short term solution when you know what's causing the pain but they do need to agree what's causing it. I couldn't tolerate the taste of the oramorph so opted for morph sulphate tablets which worked and I'm sure they can sort you out some pain relief for now rather than something that takes 3 weeks to kick in. ? There was a 'pain clinic' at the Marsden but it was on a Wednesday and I was never there on a Wednesday, eventually the doctor agreed it was a bit daft and gave me the prescription on the Friday.  Which begs the question, how many others were just suffering? I know they don't want you hooked on all sorts of strong drugs but if they agree it's linked to chemo and it will clear up when you're recovered that gives you a manageable time frame, you need to have something to focus on, you can't just suffer indefinitely And you must be moving on to the taxane next time ? hugs Carolyn xxx",

I got her a quarter of them one time, it pays to keep on the right side of the nurses. We had some in the house over Christmas, my whole family seem to like them but to me they just tasted like 'vomit', I was heartbroken. I haven't dared try them since.

I sailed through chemo, apparently, that's what my family said, and to be fair I wasn't sick and didn't get any infections so I do realise that I fared better than some others. My thinking was that I needed to eat a variety of foods to replace the vital nutrients that I was losing. Quality not quantity. I couldn't face fruit, other than melon, so chopped up an apple to make a fruity porridge, with a few nuts and seeds for the vitamins and minerals. I didn't try fasting, to be fair I only heard about it after I finished but I found I feel sick if I have low blood sugar, similar to morning sickness, or mild nausea really, so for me that would put me off.

If the sentinel node had come back with cancer in it I know she'd have frog marched me back to theatre PDQ I think the lymphatic system is still the first line of defense, none of us can rule out recurrence but if it does come back I want my nodes there dealing with it, while I have that option. Personally I think patients need to be given a choice.  If you've got a smallish tumour and are considering lumpectomy, full clearance should be Plan B, there are quite a few women whose cancer seems to have gone directly to the nodes, <20mm tumour but 5, 10 or more nodes containing cancer cells, I realise that. But if you are fit enough to withstand two surgeries, preservation ought to be Plan A, that's why lumpectomy is considered beneficial. that's my tuppence worth Carolyn x",

So If your team cannot tell you that statistically you are likely to get more than a 3% uplift  over 5 and 10 years, the short and long term side effects and immediate risk of death are simply not worth it.  Chemo isn't pleasant, I'm only just beginning to feel 'normal' at just two years after completing 6 months of EC and T.  I had problems with hair, nails and skin, hands and feet with neuropathy and gastrointestinal problems / loo issues. I've no idea if there are other long term issues yet but I suspect there will be.  AND I sailed through chemo by all accounts.  18 - 31 ( 0 - 100) or bottom third, being the 'grey area' of very little benefit or negligible benefit when compared to risk.  In my experience my oncologist was very forceful in her recommendation, she was in no doubt, and left me in no doubt, that I would definitely benefit from undergoing an intense chemo regime. Others have said their oncologist more or less shrugged and said \"it's your decision\"   Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to tell you it's a simple decision to make but it's possible that, for you, the risks will outweigh the benefits.  Tell your team that you have decided against putting yourself through chemo and see their reaction.  If they sit back and nod in agreement, there's your answer.  If they sit forwards and attempt to persuade you then they may genuinely feel you should submit. The lines have to be drawn somewhere and I have a feeling they're quite blurred.  I have to accept that I still have a 20% risk of recurrence and spread, despite all the treatments . hope that helps a bit Carolyn x",

I slept a lot, I washed my hands a lot and I tried my hardest to eat well but I'm sure I only ate melon and porridge. There were days when I only ate toast and codeine.

I still drive though.  My son rides a motorbike and I think we're all agreed that riding a motorbike on the roads represents a far greater risk than driving a car. If the pain in your leg in causing you to be miserable the you might consider the slight risk with the treatment as well worth it.  Can you get hold of the consent form to see who authored it and what the risk level is ?????????

      "Content": "hi FreyaO it sounds complicated  and I can see why you might have been worried by the consent form this is how I see it, just a personal experience.  I got into the car with my daughter and sons girlfriend and was having a little rant about how nobody was taking the time or trouble to help me deal with stuff whilst I was undergoing chemo and i said \"I have cancer\" they both said, simultaneously \"HAD\" as in past tense.  So if this treatment causes existing tumours to grow then it shouldn't affect people like us, should it, we've had all our tumours removed and had mop up chemo and rads and hormone treatments etc. I'm going to tag chloecat45 because I know she has looked into all sorts of treatments and therapies extensively and she may have some information on this.  The only slight concern might be circulating tumour cells and that is something that I worry about but the tests are not readily available.  I've no idea if the people that offer the tests might know if this PEMF treatment causes problems with circulating tumour cells. This is my thinking, I've read that most people have mutated cells but the body flushes them out, it's only when they settle and congregate they cause tumours and cancerous tumours can be a problem. Since we are susceptible as we have had to have our tumours removed I would imagine there may still be a slight risk of circulating tumour cells and a sightly higher likelihood of them settling to form more tumours.  If we have circulating tumour cells in our bodies we don't want to upset them, do we.  Are there other treatments for your poor leg, I'm guessing resting with the leg up isn't an option ? hugs Carolyn xxx",

I'm beginning to see how challenging it can be to reassure people over the internet! It's very difficult without more information and a quick examination would usually be all that is needed to reassure however I hope I can share some reassuring thoughts: It would be exceptionally rare in my experience for breast cancer to affect the knee as a lump - in fact in 19 years of seeing patients with breast cancer I cannot think of a single case! It's hard after a breast cancer diagnosis to ignore \"lumps and bumps\" or \"aches and pains\" and they deserve some attention, I have two important questions I ask my patients; \"How long has it been there?\" (Persistence) and \"Is it getting worse?\" (Severity). Lumps / pain caused by cancer tend not to improve on their own or get better with time ; problems that are not improving need to be checked out. Problems caused by cancer tend to increase as cancer grows over time - therefore lumps that are getting bigger or pains that are getting worse should be checked out. It is never \"worrying for nothing\" because thinking about new problems carefully helps you remain aware of what is happening to your body. It would be rare for a knee to be affected but if things get worse or don't get better you should ask to be examined.",

I might start saying what I'm really feeling, which in all honesty is \"waiting for it to come back\"  or \"waiting for them to find it in my brain\" that would get me some odd looks.

      "Content": "morning jenvslife  I had quite a lot of random aches and pains, most annoying was my 'tennis' elbow, apparently cancer doesn't go to your 'long bones' so I was told not to worry. The specialist on here a couple of weeks ago gave some good advice, he said whatever the thing is that's worrying you, should be consistent,  or persistent in that it's there all the time and it doesn't get better on its own, he used another word which I now can't remember. My left shin was horribly painful during the T phase of chemo, I was warned about bone pain and that was what it was and I accepted it because I was told to expect it. Make a note of all these little annoyances and bring them up at your next routine appointment. Some are remedied with physio. If the team think they are suspicious they'll organise scans, I like ultrasound, because you can quiz the radiographer at the time. If you are really concerned then say that you need the reassurance a scan will bring.  I'm intending to raise several issues at my last session of the year and maybe push for more scans in January, my CAP and bone scans were in August '15 so quite a while ago.

Using your own flesh to recreate a breast is far more natural but it's also far more risky. I'm a B / C cup and my revision implant is still on the large side, and my surgeon said he didn't want to go any smaller, it's also quite heavy. My most recent surgeon is Mr Gui from the Royal Marsden and I do trust him. I'm not that slim but I am very broad, years of swimming and diving, apparently, but at the same time totally average, 36B being the most popular bra size, I'm really not convinced by some of these statistics. I haven't investigated what the limitations are on implant reconstructions but it would appear the surgeons are not in favour of less than C, not that they use the 'C cup' sizing, that's a 'fashion' term ... vanity case, don't get me started. all of which does rather limit things for the slimmer girls I thought I'd found a really great solution in a newly developed BLite implant but the company isn't updating its web site and that's not good for a medical product. I will have another go at researching in the morning but I'm also at the RMH for an onco appointment tomorrow, make that today night all xx",

I think our online community goes someway to address loneliness, certainly the loneliness linked to our cancer diagnosis. My husband sort of helped, in his own way, but you can be lonely even if you have a house full of people.  I went to Sardinia on my own and I loved it, I got up when I wanted, I went to bed when I wanted, went to the beach, swam in the sea or the pool, it was wonderful. And I'd do it again, in fact when we went to Thailand I deliberately separated from the group for a few days. The end of the article did qualify it in that not all relationships will help. They were singling out a specific message to broadcast. Out of 10,000 women over 10 years I'd hope they came up with more insight than just that. We need to do some digging.  Besides which I think she pointed out the benefits of a good female social circle and that's something you can invest in if you feel the need, takes a bit of patience and dedication to task though. What sort of social gatherings are you into ? Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "well done on arranging a theatre trip for 30, I struggle to arrange a meeting for 4 I worry about people over Christmas, I don't want anyone to feel lonely Sarah Millican arranges to be online at a certain time to have a group chat. I thought we ought to do something like that. Even invite other groups who are less populated  (deliberately avoiding the word popular) over to the breast group for a hug. post a link to a carol concert or something so everyone's listening to the same thing ... just something to make it more of a group activity Funniest thing for me in Sardinia was people looking at me like I was lonely, supper for one, solo, it just wasn't the case, I had a houseful at home I just wanted to spend some time alone. dining group, or supper club sounds like a great idea, I guess men do join these things ? The dating sites seem to offer more social activities as groups now, such a good idea. Perhaps we should have Macmillan socials. pub quizzes, darts nights, poker or rummy evenings, learn to waltz or samba, even karaoke my husbands grandmother, great nan as we all called her, moved into a retirement home for the last 10 years of her life, 85-95,  and had a ball, she was never in, you had to book a month in advance to see her. me, I want to go nightclubbing with my daughter :D xxx",

      "Content": "I had gestational diabetes with both my younger children and for the youngest I reduced my refined sugar intake to almost zero. It was very hard as there are a lot of sugars included in things you don't expect, M&S bread for instance. I checked my blood sugars 3 x per day for 9 months.  But he was still nearly 8 lbs, whereas I'd eaten pretty much what I wanted when I'd had my daughter and she was 9lbs.  One of the more experienced midwives said, some women just have bigger babies. It just stuck in my mind, of course I put on hardly any weight myself with my son as I had with my daughter but then I shed the weight instantly with her because she fed really well, where my son didn't ever really feed that well and I had to go back to work really quickly. But overall I don't eat nearly the common average of refined sugar because I'm just not in the habit any more, that's until I developed a bit of a weakness for pain-au-raisin during chemo. I get really seriously fed up with magazine articles that ask whether organic food tastes better.  That's not the point.  Organic is better for you, less chemicals are better for you, better made products are better for you, free range 'happy' meat is better for you.  Grass fed dairy has a better source of K2 which could help prevent build up of calcium in the body, and breasts, which is a known focal point of breast cancer. I KNOW I am allergic to some household cleaners, my face tingles when my husband uses them.  I stopped buying them after my diagnosis only to find that he'd deliberately gone into town to buy the specific ones I'd told him I'd stopped buying in favour of ones I didn't react to. Is he trying to 'finish me off' I wonder ??? I had to swap shampoo because when my hair grew sufficiently and I thought I'll just wash my hair, my scalp itched, burned and tingled with the usual stuff, so I'm using Daniel Galvin Jr  sls free stuff now. I did consider getting a household water filter, chlorine isn't safe to use but it is cheap and better than using untreated water, but it's not good for you. After all is said and done I still have to accept that I got breast cancer and that despite all the treatment it may come back, spread and kill me. The one thing I did try to avoid was stress but with my husband around that is really hard, it took me an hour searching for a small gift for my aunt that he'd moved (tidied up) and usually I don't bother to ask as he just says,  \"it can't be far away\"  and so starts the hide and seek game. He did tell me he'd put it somewhere but I found it somewhere else.  It's a waste of time and effort, a real frustration but he keeps doing it, he seems to get a kick out of it. I used to wear clips in my hair to keep it out of my eyes and he didn't like it, he preferred me to wear it down, so he'd walk behind me and un-clip it, to begin with it was a joke but one night I wanted to read with the youngest and couldn't find a clip and spent a good half an hour getting properly pissed off searching the house, wasting valuable time that I could have been reading. I walked into the office and shouted at him that it was all too much and it was no longer just about the hair clip. He got up walked out and came back with .. a hair clip .. he won't change Look after yourself as best you can, eat less, move more. Sleep. Eat food that doesn't come in a packet more often than boxed up stuff. If you want to drink, drink with food, your body handles it better and don't drink to get drunk. Enjoy yourself and be happy, surround yourself with people you like or get used to your own company. enjoy sunshine and blue skies because at the end of the day you want to look back and sigh and say I had a good time hugs Carolyn xxx",

Good luck with the compression bra. On the cording, did they give you an appointment for a physiotherapist ? It's certainly something they can address and I'm sure mine did a brilliant job in one session, she called in a junior colleague who'd never experienced it and showed her the technique too. Again the arm exercises help and I got told off for doing mine too quickly, I think a few physio sessions could really help you out. Carolyn xxx",

I would have thought you'd have been invited to a meeting with the oncologist for a discussion about the scan results, with all the necessary emotional support and information? Which breast cancer did you have ? Her2+++ is notorious for for fast recurrence but usually heads for the lungs first. But like Baki says, it might not be the breast cancer spreading. Try calling the BCN you had before and see if they can speed things up, I'd be camping out in their waiting room, I realise that's not really practical.   Take care X X X  Carolyn",

I know it's a shocker that it came back so quickly but you've acted quickly too, it's easy to ignore things, especially if it's something like this. It's important to keep on top of things and be proactive. Perhaps, have a good cry today, then start thinking of practical things.

Anyway, 15 minutes is all you get, that's true and they are busy but what I found at the RMH, not sure if this is common across the UK, I'd have my 15 minutes allocated with the consultant, either the onco or the surgeon and then would be ushered to a side room to consider what I'd been told, with a BCN, who would then make sure I'd understood or if i'd got more questions. At that point I was able to raise a few points and a couple of times had a few more minutes with the 'senior' in that side room. It is such a complex set of subjects and I'm just not one for accepting everything I'm told, I need to know all the ins and outs. They must have dreaded me turning up. I suppose if hindsight allows me anything it is that for them it's simple and straightforward 90% of the time. scans and biopsies - cancer  yes or no, if no go home, if yes go to next question invasive or not - lobular or ductal  or DCIS, low grade watch and wait, high grade go to 'surgery surgery size of tumour  - small = lumpectomy - large = mastectomy chemo pathology and lymph node involvement grade and stage  -  yes or no  - no = go to radiotherapy I might have to make up a flow chart ...

      "Content": "hi candytop  it's easier when it's put in terms we can understand, I like pictures, but let me see if i can help the overall figure is 1 in 8, so if there were 32 seats on the top of the bus 4 of them would have breast cancer but that doesn't really tell the whole story, we need a plane load of women if there were 960 women on a plane then 120 would have breast cancer if we look at that group of 120 women with breast cancer, \u2022 80 will be ER+ or PR+ and (staged 1, 2 or 3)   -- chemo represents hardly any benefit to a lot of women in this group, 30 out of the 40, the rest get offered chemo but it will only help half but we don't know which half, 5 will go through chemo unnecessarily. \u2022 24 will be Her2+ (stage 1, 2 or 3)    -- chemo is a good treatment for Her2+ \u2022 12 will have triple negative   -- chemo is a good treatment for TNBC \u2022 2 will have DCIS    -- chemo doesn't affect DCIS \u2022 2 will have either lobular or inflammatory breast cancer --   one will benefit one won't  but we need about 10 women in this group \u2022 2 will have advanced or metastatic breast cancer, one diagnosed at the same time as primary  -- chemo is offered periodically but that's adding up to more than 120 we need more women so that we could further divide this group into those that suffer a recurrence before spread and those that are diagnosed with both primary and secondaries at the same time, women that have DCIS and have a lumpectomy, those who need a mastectomy ... we're gonna need a bigger plane This is theoretical and very simplified.  It's an illustration rather than being absolutely factual. if we had that massive plane, for each 100 women facing the decision on whether to have chemo or not in the ER+/PR+ group the decision to have chemo or not will affect 4 or 5 women. But, like my advertising budget, I know half of it is wasted, trouble is I don't know which half. take two women, both have ER+ breast cancer, tiny tumour, 10mm, grade 1, no lymph involvement, they both stand an excellent chance of being completely cured and there really is no benefit to putting them through chemo, especially when you consider the risks involved. take another two women, both ER+, two tumours, one lymph node involved, grade 3, the stats say that one of these women will benefit but we have no way of knowing which one, there is no test to see who is more receptive to chemo or even which type of chemo. If I have to pick one of the women to have chemo and the other not, I have no guarantee I have picked the right women. We just have to wait and see, and be vigilant. In reality, for most of us it's probably easier to think in terms of 100 women, 90 of them will walk away after successful treatment and put breast cancer firmly behind them. did that help at all ? hugs Carolyn xx NB  that 1 in 8 figure is for all women of all ages, so I think excludes pre-pubescent girls, I can't think of the adjusted figure so let's stick with 1 in 8",

Lifting heavy shopping bags is not a good idea but you can get help with that ? or just pack stuff into more bags to make it lighter. Household chores ? I've never heard anyone complain about being offered help to do that, my husband is an obsessive cleaner so it's not an issue in our house. I was completely shocked by my DCIS diagnosis but everyone else was acting like it was nothing, which was intensely annoying. I felt like I had to act like it was nothing too and it was a massive deal to me. HUGE. ENORMOUS. I wanted to cry and shout \"why me\". But then I realised I couldn't cry in front of my family because it was frightening, if I felt like crying it must be serious and if it was that serious was I going to die.  It is a big deal. I felt very sad at having to lose my breast but then I realised it was actually trying to kill me. I can see now with the benefit of hindsight that DCIS was an amazingly lucky diagnosis as my cancer had been missed in 2012 and by 2015 things could have been a lot worse than a large area of DCIS but as often with things seeming too good to be true, I did have quite a bit of invasive disease within the DCIS and it was Her2+++ so I was advised to have chemotherapy. Fingers crossed you'll have the DCIS removed and all will be fine, it sounds like your surgeon is reliable. take care x Carolyn",

I also had my large lump for nearly 3 years.  My first official breast screening in 2012 failed to detect it but when we reviewed the scans next to the ones at my private screening in May 2015 it was clearly there. Screening isn't an exact science, especially the routine ones. I had mammogram and ultrasound, then ultrasound guided biopsies of the area, upper outer left breast,  and the lymph node but both the consultants agreed I'd need an MRI and that then showed up another suspicious area on the upper inner area of the left breast. The combination of the imaging techniques gives a better picture for the team to see what's going on. Even after all that the microscopic examination will reveal what's actually going on. For large areas they seem to prefer mastectomy and there's a variety of reconstruction options, that's another set of info to get your head around.  I couldn't fathom why everyone was all smiles in my report / results meeting but now I can see that it all could have been so much worse.  The consultant was so happy to tell me I 'only' had DCIS and I'd 'only' need a mastectomy. Very weird. the breast care nurse said that I was 'over anxious' ... and to see my GP for some pills.  Lorazepam work as a temp fix. Carolyn xx",

The time I needed it most was between the biopsy and the results meeting. I googled everything I could get my hands on but strangely enough DCIS didn't crop up in my searches. I had a 75mm 'suspicious area', it wasn't round, if it had been I'm sure I'd have spotted it sooner, 75mm is a tennis ball ! Anyway, DCIS is the earliest stage, stage 0. https://community.macmillan.org.uk/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/38/p/115749/924472#924472 that link is to a nice set of illustrations, my doctors all tried drawing it but this is neater.  It shows how the cancerous cells start to break down and then become invasive. Since DCIS isn't life threatening it's not considered that serious but obviously the more there is of it, or the larger the affected area, the more likely it is to be hiding invasive cells within it.   And that's what happened to me. I had a left mastectomy in July last year, with immediate implant reconstruction, but once the breast tissue was examined under the microscope there was significant areas of invasive cells and I was recommended chemo.  The one lymph node they all thought looked dodgy turned out to be okay. try not to panic too much and just try and keep busy I try and walk most days but I've had to put a bit more effort into the business and the days are shorter, so I've slacked a bit but I start with good intentions.

I didn't have exact figures but on because I had a small tumour and no lymph node involvement i had a good prognosis. The 4% is, i think, based on a cohort of women in the same situation and gives improvement rate of that amount generally - but maybe not for a particular individual. Statistics are useful but they cannot give a guarantee. I didn't spend long thinking about this because 4% didn't seem much to me. I don't try to persuade anyone not to have chemo but I do speak up to say I didn't so that people feel they can make choices. My two year check up has just taken place and currently there is no evidence of disease. But who knows about the future! Squeaky It is really helpful to have someone who has not had chemo, it really does allow people to have a choice, or make a proper choice they know they over treat, I am not sure of the numbers but it's a lot and I know they are working towards better tests to see who will benefit and who won't but for now perhaps I need another reference page \"those who said NO to chemo\"  then I can point those who have this ridiculously difficult decision to make to go and check out the real people stories hugs Carolyn xx",

The bit I find most frustrating is that I'd been called in for mammograms for my lumpy breasts on a few occasions but nothing sinister was found. Why wasn't I on a 'double' check list. I had my first routine mammogram in 2012 which was just reported as 'clear'.  Even the operator frowned at my breasts, i just thought, it's okay everyone wants to double check them. Roll on to 2015 and I'd booked a private screening since I wasn't getting any joy on the NHS and there is was, 75mm.  But when biopsied it only revealed DCIS. The consultant and radiologist both agreed it should have been spotted in 2012, it's clearly there on the mammogram.  So that's 3 years at least, that we know about. Other people have a tiny lump, they go to their GP straight away, get an immediate urgent referral and find it's spread. There's no logic to it. I felt stupid for not spotting something that was 75mm but to be fair to me I couldn't have done much more, I'd pestered my GP and had scans. In fact I'd had scans and clinic appointments for all sorts of things, all came back clear. My biggest problem now is trusting the scans, my bone and CAP scans were clear but then all my scans were 'clear'. I've asked for another review in the new year but the Royal Marsden has started to not offer routine scans, in favour of requests, but the requests have to be based on the two criteria persistence and severity, in other words, a specific symptom that is there constantly and is getting progressively worse. I've signed up for that programme which is nurse specialist lead, part of it is helping us move on and get over the constant fear of recurrence and spread.

There is also an issue with Herceptin  not being available to people who can't tolerate taxol and have to self fund because NICE only approves it with the taxane.  I have an AXA policy and I'm covered for everything other than breast cancer immediately and the breast cancer will be covered after 2 years. It's about £75 per month.  My only reservations were that I had never had private healthcare and I didn't know whether some of the add ons were worth it, I have no real idea if I'm covered for the right things but I can vary it year on year.  in fact I ought to consider various illness and potential healthcare issues to work out if I do have sufficient cover.  I'd have thought that some of the insurers ought to look closely at covering us specifically.  does that help ?

The hormone therapies are relatively cheap and do prevent secondaries or metastases in over 90% of people, I'm fairly sure of that statistic, and I'm also fairly sure they can be used to contain secondaries in a lot of cases. Then there are targeted therapies for controlling hormone receptor positive secondaries like palbociclib, which has just been approved for use in the NHS.  Being Her2+++ I didn't really pay much attention to the ER+ treatments but 10 years on tamoxifen only takes you to 51 and I'm really not sure what happens after that, some women are peri or mid menopause around that time, I know I was, I'm 55 now.  I'm not sure if they count tamoxifen as continued treatment, I guess they should, I can send an email to my contact at AXA.

      "Content": "hi Lizz I wasn't sick at all for which I was pretty grateful but I had dia ... diah... the shits ! from day one and throughout and anything I took to stop it, which was basically DHC which I was taking for the pain, caused the opposite effect, and a few people have said the same, it's a balancing act to get the daily movements sorted.  we don't have sufficient words for pain either and I do sympathise with French et al having to do it in a foreign language I have two pain levels I refer to 1. is child birth, which I coped with reasonably well and 2. is tooth ache which I'm a complete wimp at All my nurses had no children and beautiful teeth.   And it wasn't until I experienced excruciating mobilising pain from an elastic bandage round my chest to stop a leaking artery that I realised I'd not come close to my actual threshold. It felt like I was being stabbed but I checked twice and I definitely wasn't. I couldn't move forwards or backwards, I could barely breathe. I was just about to try and shout for help because I figured I must be dying when I remembered I was supposed to take the bandage off at bedtime and it was nearly bed time. As soon as I undid the clip the pain vanished. Chemo brain is real and it creeps up on you, write everything down. Don't laugh but I took a photo of where I parked my car one day, just in case.  My wig was my salvation and it only cost just over 100 quid, which I thought was quite a lot but now sounds like an absolute bargain. My hair has grown back but seems to have stalled at the moment, which I'm hoping isn't because I dyed it too soon  :0 Apart from one weekend when everything tasted like cork or polystyrene food was fine. Cheese and crackers worked for me, the taste and texture was realistic. I'm not sure about fasting, but living off melon for a few days would probably count according to her 'quack'. That first day she describes is down to the steroids, if gives you a 24 grace period, my husband looked at me curiously and asked how it felt, it didn't feel of anything and I felt fine, but then couldn't get up off the sofa and kept falling asleep, so I got send back to bed. Go for a walk every day. Get some fresh air and make the effort to do something normal. I was unable to go a few times, especially at the end when my toenails were threatening to fall off but I felt much much better when I went out. For the toenails I used savlon cream and a light gauze cover taped in place loosely just to stop them catching. But others may have better advice on that. Carolyn x",

      "Content": "hi pipsters  I have lumpy dense breasts and was always being referred for mammograms but nothing sinister was ever found,  it's not wasting anyone's time, it's just making sure nothing gets missed or overlooked.  Breast cancer is easy to treat if it's caught early. Ironically my very first routine mammogram when I was almost 50 missed a 15mm tumour, it was only after many visits to the GP and being told it was just my age and just my hormones I gave up and booked myself a private screening session and there was this huge tumour, 75mm, but it wasn't a lump, it was sort of flat, like a credit card and the only bit you could feel was the edge poking out the side of my breast, it was my arm brushing against it that helped me make that decision to pay for the private mammogram. Talk to your GP and get a referral, you should have a local breast clinic, a one stop shop, where they will do a mammogram, then they'll look with ultrasound to check what the mammogram is showing and IF they see anything slightly suspicious they might do a biopsy. It doesn't take long, maybe an hour, two if you need the biopsy. I was very lucky that in the 3 years my breast cancer apparently hadn't spread, even though 1 lymph node looked suspicious. call the GP for an appointment Monday Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "hi Ruthie I am against chemotherapy for people that are borderline, it's dangerous and carries a significant risk. The risk for ALL chemo for ALL patients is 10%.  That means that 10 people in every 100 will die. Breast cancer is a lot lower because we, as a group, are easier to manage, we take our meds, we turn up for appointments and we check our symptoms and act, by going to A&E, when we're told it's necessary. But I'm going to say it's still around 5% for a 4% uplift.  That's negative by 1%. It is a massive decision to make and I don't envy you one bit.  I didn't have a choice in the end, I was told I was an idiot (or words to that effect) for not consenting to chemo as it represented something like a 30% uplift in stats. Everyone has chemo for Her2+++ breast cancer.   Except those who are too ill or too frail. It's a lot to put you body through. You have to be fit and healthy to even consider it. The long term effects are monumental for some. I got lucky, I wasn't sick, I was never hospitalised due to infections, I didn't have any blot clots, I managed to get through it relatively unscathed but I know I'm in the minority.  There are plenty of women on here who probably shouldn't have consented to chemo, they've been in and out of hospital and are physically wrecked by the treatment. I know that despite going through nearly 6 months of chemo I still have a 20 % chance of recurrence. Even if you are statistically 95% likely to survive 10 years, there's still a 5% chance you won't. I wouldn't. But I know that Kacang is going to jump all over me now and tell you a different story. much love and hugs Carolyn xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Annetha  I had that diagnosis last May. My local hospital weren't able to offer much in the way of reconstruction so I was referred to the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. Their preferred plan is immediate reconstruction and I chose implant as I felt it was quite urgent, although they didn't seem to think so, and I didn't want to hang around for a specialist surgeon, and they reassured me I could change my mind at a later date and this left my options open. I have to say the surgery went fine and I healed reasonably well, I had an amount of seroma but it was manageable. The scar wasn't too dramatic and eventually healed fine.  You will need to be patient as your new body takes a bit of getting used to and scars take time to heal. There are quite a few web sites with post mastectomy exercises and it really helps to do them every day, especially for my node scar, I had a bit of cording but had a brilliant physio work her magic on me. If you have an overnight stay don't expect much sleep, they check you every hour or so. Also do keep in mind that around 20% of women are upgraded to invasive once the breast tissue is examined under the microscope. My first consultant warned me gently this could happen and I'm grateful he did, he was very kind, the RMH team were more blasé and it was a bit of a surprise when I got my results and did have to go through chemo, hopefully you'll be fine but it's better to be armed with the information.

I felt really ill after my biopsies in May last year, couldn't eat, felt sick and my tumour became darker and visible without X-ray. But I was told I was over anxious and to see my GP for some meds. I was furious. One breast care nurse in particular was quite rude to me. Once my post op pathology was in I was suddenly classed as urgent and whisked round all the staging scans in record breaking time. There is a logical order, generally speaking but lines have to be drawn somewhere and if you're close to one of these magical lines, one doctor might say one thing and one will decide another.  I was scheduled to have mastectomy only but somehow a tumour was missed, we did all the 'should have gone to spec savers ' jokes, that tumour and the area of DCIS was actually quite aggressive Her2+++ so I ended up having chemo to shrink this other tumour.  After that things went to plan as I had no drama at all through chemo. You have another couple of weeks of finger twiddling then things should settle down. Have you had a dental check up ? That should take you mind off things for a few minutes. Carolyn X",

Having two slides or images to compare is vital, once the 2012 image was next to the 2015 image it was obvious there was something seriously wrong. BUT the biopsy just didn't see it, the consultant was expert enough to say, we only sampled 3 very tiny areas of that 65mm area and there is every chance something more sinister is lurking which will only become apparent after your surgery when your tissue can be put under the microscope properly,  how right he was.  Even the imaging team and specialists at the Royal Marsden wouldn't listen when I repeated what he'd said, they said, oh no, it's nothing to worry about, you're not an urgent case.  Then freaked out once the results came back 3 weeks later.  allow yourself some time to go through the stages of grief, get angry, get sad, have a good cry, have a go at blaming and bargaining but then sit back and take a few deep breaths and focus on the stuff you can do and must do to make the most of your life whatever age we are, whatever stage we are, we have one life and if you try and sulk in the corner those wags in the AWAKE thread will come and drag you out treatment wise, I have no idea but if they have removed all of the suspicious cells from your lung you may find you'll be offered a short course of chemo and then watch and wait, then you might need some counselling or other therapies to adjust it will be up to you to find the right people to help you, I found my physiotherapist was very good, even though she made me cry not because she was twisting my arm, although that did hurt but she kept saying \"are you alright\" and I'd say \"I'm fine\" but eventually I'd crumble and she'd say it's okay, just let it out Carolyn xxx",

Obviously she couldn't give me specifics so I don't know if it was TNBC, I suspect probably not but I don't know. It is possible that even TNBC won't be the cause of death for your grandmother, yes it can be aggressive but it could take a few years to progress to the point it actually ends her life and at 90 I'd have thought it could easily be something else.  The treatments are also harsh and at 90 she's much more likely to suffer the more severe side effects of chemotherapy, which can be fatal.  faced with a choice of the sorts of ailments that old age can bring I'm not really sure which I'd choose all we really want is a quiet, dignified passing with no pain but in the meantime lots of parties and adventures, is she a party girl ? hugs Carolyn xxx",

The very earliest stage of breast cancer is stage 0 or DCIS.   DCIS requires surgery but not chemotherapy. If it's that, then everyone will be delighted for you, be prepared to be told the bad news by smiling people, which I found a bit strange. DCIS has three grades and the lowest grade is very slow moving, it can take years to manifest itself as something that needs treatment. How old are you? As we age our bodies and functions tend to slow down. We were collecting top tips for trying to cope with anxious waiting for results phase the other day. Keeping busy seemed to be the consensus.  And chatting on here of course. For the appointment with the surgeon let him tell you what he intends to do and explain the options, make notes, then ask questions. Without getting personal, whether you have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy will depend on the lump to breast ratio, so be prepared for him to go through the pros and cons of each of those surgical options. There will probably be more tests, some will require tracers to be injected into your blood via a cannula, time to get over any fear of needles. Generally speaking the fitter you are the better you'll cope with surgery and walking helps pass the time too. Do you walk or swim or play sport ?? check out the link and come back with some quetsions Carolyn xxx hugs",

In a nutshell, you'll be more liable to pick up infections, that's pretty common knowledge but what a lot of people don't realise is that a super quick way for infections to creep into our blood stream is via the gums. Most people are like, what's flossing got to do with neutropenic sepsis???  Most of the time we cope with the bacterial build up in our mouths perfectly fine but while going through chemo it can cause problems. Book an appointment with your dentist and hygienist and then get some Corsodyl daily and a nice soft toothbrush. I went overboard and got a water flosser, it was fun but I'm sure I didn't really need it. Just floss carefully without impacting the gum line. Sort of a fun thing to worry about, take the mind off the rest of it. Anyway it's Friday. You have to stop worrying for the weekend, you can start up again Monday morning. Carolyn x",

The soles of my feet still burn a bit if I walk far, but I do walk quite extensive distances some days. I like Neutrogena hand and foot products, they seem to suit my skin.  I did have some gel insoles but I haven't tried them lately, they're not too expensive if you want to give them a go, and I'm wondering if your GP might even be able to prescribe them ?? I did buy a cooling foot gel but never actually tried it.  The key thing for me is I've got more sensitive to creams, lotions and potions since chemo so it's best to try it / patch test it first. Thankfully when my skin on my heels looked like great swathes of it was going to fall off it seemed to heal itself. Best advice I had was to wear two thin pairs of socks to avoid blisters on long distance walks, more like hiking, it does work. Carolyn xx",

How are you arriving at 25 days ? My 3 weekly EC seemed like I was almost a stranger in the medical day unit but once I'd switched to 2 weekly Tax and 3 weekly Herceptin I seemed to be in the unit all the time. 3 weeks from the last EC is 21 days and if your figure of 25 is just adding 4 days on to that, that's not going to be a huge problem. so hit me with some dates and let's have a think about it hugs Carolyn xxxx",

I really do think it should be via diet rather than supplements but I know that's sometimes difficult, I'm not a fan of bananas and you would need to eat a few to get the RDA but I'm better with tomatoes. Himalayan pink salt is a current favourite of mine, lots of minerals in it. a few nuts, seeds and dried fruits go some way to addressing this and whilst on chemo I chucked a handful of everything into porridge. And you might need to rest a bit more, is that possible or do you want to throw something at me panda ? :D Carolyn xx",

Back to my other soap box item of getting sufficient variety in your diet to replace the tiny amounts of essential vitamins and minerals and trace elements. http://www.lymphomas.org.uk/about-lymphoma/treatment/side-effects-lymphoma-treatments/neutropenia-and-risk-infection that's one of the more extensive lists of helping you cope with low counts, but doesn't really touch on replacing or boosting. Most medical pros will indicate avoiding 'raw' or unpasteurised foods whilst on chemo, due to the risk of bacterial infections and I have a feeling Manuka might be one of those, it's raw state being the attraction for boosting the immune system in healthy individuals. Unfortunately being the exact things they advise to avoid on chemo. Most say nothing is proven, which sounds like fence sitting to me. Isn't the standard self help for uti's cranberry juice ? have you tried that ? I had a 'stinging when I pee'd' incident, where my BCN asked if I'd been sexually active, it's best that happened over the phone, but it wasn't a uti, per se, more soft tissue around the labia being broken and sensitive, I used sudocrem delicately patted on the affected area.

I opted to lose the nipple and the post op pathology/histopathology showed Pagets so just as well I did. The partially sighted surgeon also missed a 15mm tumour that had popped up in the meantime but rather than operate immediately they sent me over to the oncology team where I had 4 x EC and 4 x Tax with Herceptin, which shrank the tumour, finally had revision surgery in March '16. result : further surgery may be necessary The treatment plan is still in debate as they have quite rightly told you that they need to further investigations, and you will have to be a bit patient. result : you will be offered some drug therapy, it may be hormone therapy to begin with or they might decide on a standard FEC T regime. I know you are worried it's spread, I still can't believe mine hadn't, but I have to trust them, I asked them to double check twice.

I do know the feeling of soldiering on with treatment because I was going to be cured, even though I knew it might not work, there's no guarantees but everyone said it was worth giving it a try, it did represent a big uplift in my stats. I can think back to some days when it did cross my mind that if it wasn't for a cure then what was the point of feeling so exhausted. I've attended parliament and a NICE meeting to campaign for drugs to be made available so that those that need them can have them. The drugs that can extend people's lives for many years with relatively few side effects, despite looking well and healthy these women do still report feeling a bit rough one week in three. I do also accept everyone's right to choose what is best for them. But I would like to understand a bit more about why ? Carolyn xxx",

I was very grumpy when my hair fell out, it's quite shocking when you touch it and handfuls come away and i thought i'd prepared myself for it but my sons girlfriend said, they're not doing it for fun or to annoy you, it is saving your life. I think that calmed me down a lot and I just turned up and got on with it after that. I know what you mean about the 'knowing your body'  I was quite embarrassed that I'd not detected the massive tumour but I had pestered my GP back in 2011 and 2012, I couldn't really have done much more, I am still relieved, although still not totally confident, that in the 3 years it hadn't spread beyond the breast.

CT scan ?  where are you based, if you don't mind me asking, treatment options do seem to vary by area.  My team at the Royal Marsden don't use FEC, they dropped the 'F' so I just had EC and accelerated Taxol. My husband freaked out when I got an extra inch cut off my hair just before my mastectomy, he took the whole thing quite badly. I have more questions but I won't bug you now, perhaps just one, is your 18 year old the only child ? if he's off to uni he won't see you 'ill'  that worked for a friend of mine. Carolyn x",

We know that a fair percentage of women are borderline for chemo will 'choose' to have the treatment, it's our decision at the end of the day, but may not actually benefit from it. benefits 1. flushes out cancer cells to prevent recurrence or spread 2. improvement in 5 year and 10 year survival statistics risks 1. impact on the immune system, high risk of infections, leading to hospitalisation, possibly even neutropenic sepsis, which can be fatal 2. diarrhoea and vomiting, nausea, appetite changes, loss of taste and smell 3. all the usual risks documented in the leaflets and some more obscure ones 4. hair loss - everything, eyelashes, eyebrows the lot for me with 75mm DCIS, multiple areas of invasive ductal, pagets and a 2nd tumour of 15mm, grade 3, almost stage 3 and Her2+++ , I was looking at 50% survival but I didn't want chemo, I didn't want to look sick, I didn't feel sick/ill but my onco said that if I didn't agree she would have locked me in the room. Chemo represented an almost 30% uplift in my 5 year and 10 year survival prospects. I gave up arguing. I had my last chemo on Christmas Eve. I still look very different to how I did but I have eyebrows and lashes and hair, which I can style and I've dyed it back to brown. But there are plenty of ladies on here who've had a torrid time on chemo. at 63 I think I'd just choose the hormone therapy, there are options on that, someone else can advise, and the radiotherapy I don't have every item for the 'Predict' tool but I've entered what you've told us and chemo represents just 1.3% uplift in your chances it's 91.2 % likely that you're already cured.  I think the risks of chemo outweigh the benefits for you http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict.html Lynn will probably have a different view, but she's in Australia  Kacang  hope that helps, good luck with whatever you decide, come back if you need more negotiations NB with clear nodes I'm unsure on the radiotherapy, anyone ???

Your husband sounds a bit more reasonable than mine. I may consider another thread about this but .. here goes ... after my mastectomy we tried out the new implant for sex appeal and that worked reasonably well, it was nice to establish a closer relationship after 8 stressful weeks. However I instantly started peeing blood ! I limped round to the GP first thing with my sample, convinced I was dying, I even made a note of the hymns I'd like at my funeral, only to be told it was bacterial cystitis, I felt like a teenager. I cried he got annoyed and we only tried it once after that before chemo started, actually I tell a lie, we tried it after the first round, then I remembered we were supposed to use a condom and that put him off and we haven't done it since. There's definitely a case for you not putting yourself through chemo and I can see why he may argue that and I can't blame him. It is not pleasant for anyone concerned, and, I actually think it's harder for those who have to watch us than for us going through it. I can't watch my kids suffer even so much as a cold, I'd rather suffer myself. I felt a bit rubbish and immensely tired so I went to bed but I caught him several times, when I was sort of dozing, tiptoeing into the room, reaching out to prod me, to see if I was still alive. It is heartbreaking.  It's easy for me to tell Alice that refusing chemo is the right thing to do but for you I don't know. You're so young, I think I'd go belt and braces, but it's going to be tough on your husband.

I had the MRI locally and they all agreed it didn't need to be re-done, the machines at the Marsden weren't hugely different to the local ones. But the scans then got reported twice, the local BCN called to ask where to send the report, Sutton or Chelsea, so I took the opportunity to quiz her on the contents and she got her lefts and rights mixed up which caused much confusion. The report said 65mm upper outer left and 15mm upper right, but she said 65mm right and 15mm left, which I realised was wrong, because I'd seen the mammogram and ultra sound and knew the large area was in my left breast not right, but the 2nd lesion was in the right side of my left breast not my right breast. anyway, that report  never arrived with the team in London, allegedly,  and it all went downhill from there ...

      "Content": "back ... now for the ramble why chemo \u2022 in advance of surgery to shrink tumours, \u2022 where surgery isn't possible, and \u2022 after surgery to mop up any stray cells why not chemo \u2022 other health factors which might make chemo too risky, age and life stage etc \u2022 low to moderate improvement in stats \u2022 personal preference, family or work commitments, not all of us can take six months off \u2022 chemo effectiveness varies patient to patient and in some cases the risks outweigh the benefits this is very simplistic but sometimes it helps to keep it simple I was told that everyone who has Her2+ breast cancer is offered chemo and that NICE haven't approved Herceptin without it, so if I wanted to survive more than 5 years I was told I'd be an idiot to refuse, I don't think she used the word idiot but she did threaten to look me in the room until I agreed. I have since found out that not everyone who is Her2+ is offered chemo but I'm thinking that's very early stages and tiny tumours with no lymph node involvement . https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28382636 This article supports what we've heard or been told about chemo not being as effective in treating ILC (invasive lobular) or has limited impact on outcomes, whichever phrase your prefer.  *edited. However your team might say that because your tumours were on the large side, over 50mm (65mm in my case) and a few lymph nodes were affected, they may suggest that it could be beneficial but chemo is brutal and the side effects are much more profound and long lasting than they allude to. I might start another thread about this topic actually, but I really struggled after chemo and I had my last dose Christmas Eve 2015. I saw you posted support for someone else, we're all in it together and I found it really helped to have someone to confide in on here.  You're still in shock or rather you're still in the middle of the grieving process. Shock, disbelief, denial, confusion, anger, sadness, blaming & bargaining, acceptance and moving on, and I went round and round rather than being able to move swiftly through it.   Did they give you a contact card, I was given the number for the breast care nurses, all of whom were a bit useless in the two hospitals i had dealings with but I've heard others found theirs helpful and informative and very supportive.  Just so you know, I usually advocate for saying 'no' to chemo because I think some people feel pressured into accepting it and sometimes the risks really do outweigh the benefits.  The overall risk with chemo is 10%, that's a 10% risk of death, all cancers and all patients.  Breast is a lot lower, something like 3% because breast cancer is treatable and mostly curable, we're good patients, we attend our appointments and take our medications.  So unless you are given an improvement of 10% I'd say no thanks. Mine was something 50% improving to 80% using the Predict tool and this is the bit I'm not sure on, I don't know if that tool works for lobular.  https://breast.predict.nhs.uk That's the link, feel free to play with it but I can't see ILC, quiz the oncologist on Monday ! Ramble over, how did I do ? Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi Sophie this isn't scientific but I was adamant I didn't want chemo because everyone I knew who'd had chemo had died.  Looking back now they were all pretty sick in any case, people do die as a result of cancer despite huge leaps forward in treatment, both drug types and dosing. People die, that's a fact of life, at some point medical science will be so effective that it will force us to choose how and when we die and I'd seriously not be able to cope with making that decision ! The admins don't like this topic being debated because it worries people BUT it needs saying, I was told it, quite matter of factly. this bit is science, it's freely available  www.cancerresearchuk.org/.../how-cancer-can-spread Cancerous cells that are well defined are not too much of a problem but the less well defined they become the more risk the pose. Once the outer membrane is breached they become infiltrating and they then have the capacity to travel around the body either in the lymphatic system, can be caught in the nodes or the blood stream. This is what happens when cancers metastasise or spread, forming cancers remote from the origin. Breast cancer can spread anywhere but usually goes to bones, lungs, liver and/or brain.  See, it's not a nice topic to have to get a grip on and it's all a bit scary. It's as well to make people aware of possible symptoms, tummy ache, headache, bone pain, breathlessness and dry cough,  because it's still important to discover spread early, despite everyone telling me the outcomes don't vary, that's another debate actually, remind me.  Chemo works to 'mop up' stray cells, it's a systemic treatment, I had to look that up when I was diagnosed and I just had to look it up again now. Surgery cuts out the affected part when possible. There is the potential for some stray cells to escape during surgery and everyone acknowledges this, there is also potential during biopsy, people tend to try and shove that fact under the rug. But logic tells you it's the same, incision and spillage.  The body can deal with some rogue cells but at a point, a tipping point, the body stops dealing with them and they become a problem. I was told that cancer doesn't get better on its own and on the whole that's correct, there's going to be exceptions that prove that rule but mostly once we reach that tipping point we start to feel ill and probably get around to doing something about it, the 'Be Clear on Cancer' campaign urged us to do that, I did but my symptoms weren't classic enough and I wasn't quite old enough at 48 and I was missed.  This bit isn't science ...  it's just what happened to me. I had symptoms for several years, nothing to do with breast cancer, I had an itchy eye that looked like an allergy, it wouldn't clear up, I saw dozens of doctors, most of them couldn't even see the problem . I felt under the weather but not really ill. I'd been through an immensely stressful time and I couldn't afford to take myself off to soak up some sun. I was also going through the menopause and two of my GPs said it was all down to that.  I had dozens of tests, all clear.  With the benefit of hindsight i'd have been a fool to refuse chemo, I think I'd had cancer cells circulating in my body for all that time, thankfully they didn't cluster and settle elsewhere, it was confined to my breast. But post surgery I still didn't heal and I had a UTI, although the 2nd lot of antibiotics worked on it.  You've had something that won't heal up on its own nor with repeated efforts with medication. I'd have thought your team would recognise that as a trigger to push you to go through with chemo, did you mention it when you saw them? Sometimes we don't put 2 and 2 together.  IF you can persuade them to find you a circulating tumour cell test you'll have your answer.  https://www.oncologica.com/precision-oncology/ these people have some interesting stuff, not sure how applicable it is, and I know the NHS does fund some tests. sorry for the ramble, again    and I hope I've helped, I struggled for two whole weeks with my decision, as I said I was adamant I didn't want chemo but my oncologist was not going to take no for an answer . I have suggested that to people, say no and if they lean back in their chair and nod, you're good with a 'no', if they lean forward and grab your wrist tight, as mine did, you'll know you're in for a hot debate for a 'yes'.  Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "evening cat53  let's start with the simple bit and that's the copied text from the Google search for parenchyma , below, which is functional tissue, i.e. the milk ducts etc as opposed to muscles  parenchyma pəˈrɛŋkɪmə/ noun ANATOMY the functional tissue of an organ as distinguished from the connective and supporting tissue. \"the liver parenchyma\" now the less easy part, how not to worry about more cancer ... I had scans that missed obvious tumours which were never reported but I have seen a couple of instances where other patients simply weren't told.  I know I didn't take in everything that was said to me in appointments and I felt stupid keeping asking the same questions over and over but frankly the whole diagnosis was a head freak.  So it could be that you were told and just didn't hear or they just didn't mention it because it was of 'no importance'. Either way you know about it now and you need answers, otherwise you'll worry.  I have lumpy dense breasts and my right breast has had \"dense but unremarkable\" as a statement in the report, makes me feel so attractive . For me my right breast is suspicious because it looked exactly the same as the left which had the cancer, the lumpy bits, one of which turned out to be a cancerous tumour in my left breast, the crepey skin, the slightly orange peel effect but apparently the right one is fine. In my humble opinion, and from my own experience, I had a suspicious lump that was missed in my routine mammogram in 2012 but by 2015 it was sort of a little bit more noticeable so I got it checked, at which point they agreed it had been suspicious all along.  Once I'd had it biopsied it freaked out and you could tell that it flared up, and although it only presented as DCIS via the biopsy and was therefore not urgent, I felt really quite ill by the time they got around to surgically removing it six weeks later. Looking into it there is a small but quite well documented group whose cancer reacts badly to being biopsied and I'm guessing it's for that reason they don't routinely go prodding around.  The only thing you can really do is ask your GP to look into it with you and request a more in-depth report on this 'benign mass'. It won't necessarily turn into a cancer but it would be foolish to ignore the possibility.  Most BCNs will tell you that signs and symptoms are really obvious but reading experiences on here i'd say that's just not true.  How did I have breast cancer for 3 whole years and not realise ? How did I miss a 75mm tumour ? How lucky do I feel that it hadn't spread in that time or in the 6 weeks it took them to surgically remove my breast and then discover aggressive Her2+++ in the pathology AND a whole 12mm tumour the surgeon had missed completely.  It is down to us to keep check.  On the up side they know about it and they know it hasn't changed in 3 years. My lump definably changed in that 3 year period.  but I'd still ask questions  Carolyn xx",

Do you have any other health issues ?   I always used to laugh out loud when the doctors said you're in pretty good shape ... and I'd say, well, apart from the cancer ... and we'd laugh Can you feel like you've got the flu for the next six months, so you need to work, do you get sick pay.  If you are a teacher,  you get to sign off sick. That was a good decision you made when you graduated.  I was 'lucky' because I didn't have a choice, I'm a Libran and choice is fatal, one of the funniest things my husband ever said was to a waiter, don't give her a menu, we'll be here all week.  I am world champ level indecisive . Then I'd choose the 'special' because it would be whatever was 'fresh' today, and he'd say \"we'll be here all night because you chose the 'special' ... I digress  actually I made a good point If you're in a restaurant and you make a choice, are you always happy with your decision making ? Same goes with chemo.  I chose fish once and everyone else had chicken and I had the worst food poisoning ever, compounded by the fact we had no water all night, I truly felt I wasn't going to make it. All mushrooms are edible, some are only edible once.  Ultimately at some point you have to be happy and content that you made the right decision .  Like I said, I had it easy, she was going to lock me in the room until I agreed, I didn't really have a choice. Only other clue is how do you feel, circulating tumour cells is the next big thing and if, after surgery, you have the CTC test and it shows you do still have circulating cells, then you must have chemo to mop them up. I might have to invest in that technology ... it really would be the answer to our prayers ... actually, ask your team if you can have that ? Carolyn xxx PS sorry for the ramble",

I think the Predict tool factors this in, and I have a 20% risk.  I'm still happy to advocate for not having chemo except for this UTI.  I had the biopsy in May, about 3 days later I started to feel ill and got progressively worse up until surgery and my wound didn't heal AND I had a UTI.  It is documented that some people react badly to biopsies but that overall the chances are slim and they are so useful for diagnosis that it is felt to be worth the risk.  With the benefit of hindsight, had I stuck to my guns and refused chemo, those circulating tumour cells would have settled and spread.  In which case I'd have to say have the chemo.   The friendly radiologist also said \"we've got one chance, we don't want this settling anywhere else\"   that was whilst discussing the 2nd tumour that had been missed in surgery, as I was then effectively having neo-adjuvant chemo.  Give me the timeline again, what happened to trigger the UTI, can you remember ?

I did get an answer from the Oncofocus people, if you're interested ? >> As you have probably already read, the Oncofocus® test is applicable to all cancers (except lymphoma and leukaemia) and allows us to identify precisely the right targeted therapies/immunotherapies that the patient\u2019s tumour is likely to respond to on the basis of the DNA mutations present in the tumour. This is called personalised medicine or precision oncology. Targeted therapies are new drugs that specifically hit cancer cells and not the normal cells of the body. This means they can be much more effective than chemotherapy and do not have the associated severe toxic side effects such as hair loss, infections, anaemia, gut toxicity and fatigue. Most targeted therapies are taken as an oral pill and therefore do not need hospital based infusions. We have now updated the Oncofocus® Test to enable us to match the unique mutation profile of the tumour covering 505 genes linked to 734 targeted therapies including immunotherapy. Oncofocus® is able to identify additional treatment options in 90% of patients.

There are lots of things that can show up on scans, I had some fluid left on my lungs after a particularly nasty cough/cold/flu/chest infection and I wondered why they didn't bother to investigate further but they haven't. So fluid does show up, have you had any chest infections ? That can last months, even years and mostly you won't even notice it. My mother had some kind of long running lung condition which wasn't cancer, I can't remember what it was now. Any kind of scar tissue will show up, allergies can cause scarring. I used to smoke when I was young and carefree and invincible and I'm sure that leaves traces. Waiting on scans and tests is the worst part and distraction is the only way I've found to cope, taking long walks, shopping, baking, days out with the kids. Knitting ? If you feel the need to chat about it you can always call the helpline, it's closed at the weekends but open each weekday and , as they say, a problem shared is a problem halved. I don't like to voice my worst fears to my family so it's useful to have an outlet. What sort of breast cancer did you have ?  I'm going to assume ER+ or hormone positive since it doesn't sound like you had chemotherapy and Her2+ and triple negative usually requires chemo.

      "Content": "hi  Rachmeister  bad luck  on the implant I also had left mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction and the first one was a sorry sight. It was huge and I developed a lot of seroma, the scar look like something had chewed me, possibly that mountain lion we all chuckled about, and it had these tags which I now know are called dog ears. There was also a small gap at one end which never really healed. I thought it would affect the start of chemo but the team didn't seem to think it was a problem. So I wasn't impressed but I didn't have time to kick up a fuss because I'd realised that a 2nd lump that had appeared in my chest/breast whilst waiting for my mastectomy surgery was actually still there, so that sort of took priority over whinging about the state of the boob job. They then decided I needed chemotherapy and so I did 6 months of that first. In April 2016 I had revision surgery and the whole thing looked much better, it healed completely and a lot quicker, within two weeks, plus the scar was neater with no dog ears AND hardly any seroma. I hadn't really had any sort of discussion about whether I wanted reconstruction or not, and it wasn't until I went swimming last summer and the youngest wanted me to teach him to dive that I felt for the first time that this implant was a considerable drag attached to my front. The surgeon wouldn't put a smaller implant in, he only wanted to drop one size from the original but really I could have gone 2 or 3 sizes smaller and possibly even got away with nothing. A mate round the corner wasn't given the option of immediate reconstruction and her original scar was very neat, she's now having an expander, I need to catch up with her to see how that's going. I think I'd give everything a chance to settle down. I'm going to sound like your mother but it's possible you might be over doing things and haven't let your body heal and although some activity helps, you sound like a fidget bottom with plenty of manual labour that requires a lot of effort. Unless you learn to put your feet up and give your body a chance to repair and replenish, any further surgery will carry a similar risk of failure. OK lecture over. option 1 - have another go at skin sparing reconstruction with a smaller implant as suggested option 2 - revision surgery to remove implant and sacrifice skin, leave for 8 weeks and insert expander etc.   or leave options open. option 3 - diep or lat dorsi ?  I can't imagine you opting for either of these but it's worth considering I think I'd ask for the surgeons opinions on whether giving your body a break and then revisiting reconstruction options in a few weeks time will make a difference ? Are you fit and healthy in other respects ? Are you stressed ? Do you eat a good variety of foods to get all the essential vitamins and minerals to help your body repair itself ?  Food is better than supplements. Being active should exclude circulation issues but the nutrients need to be there too, and oxygen. The key thing for me was that around the first surgery I just didn't feel very well and I felt a lot better, fitter and healthier going into the 2nd surgery. With the benefit of hindsight the healing, or lack of, makes sense in that context. hugs Carolyn xxx",

I will get this right one day, but , shock, denial, disbelief, sadness, more denial, blaming and bargaining, more denial, fear, blame, sadness, more denial and gradually gradually you kind of get over it and accept what's happened and get on with it. I usually miss one of the stages of the grieving process. Bad luck on the biopsy !   My guy didn't mention the scalpel initially, he just said 'big needle' so when he went for the second site and asked for a scalpel, I said, you didn't mention knives, he laughed and said, sorry, didn't I ?  He was very nice about it and I didn't feel a thing until the local wore off.

Chemotherapy won't offer obvious benefits to everyone and it's a highly toxic cocktail of dangerous chemicals, which, if it's going to save your life, is worth putting yourself through. If you are waiting for the oncotype test it means there isn't a clear obvious benefit, hence the extra test. I do feel for anyone who has to make the decision for themselves, it seems rather unfair, we're suddenly plunged into this unfamiliar arena and then have to make life changing decisions. My onco threatened to lock me in the room if I refused so it was out of my hands in the end. You need some distractions. I like to walk around the local park.  I have a list of movies I'd like to watch but when confronted with NetFlix I never remember what they are. I was distracting myself with Pokemon Go but got stuck on level 18. I had my surgery on the 1st July 2015 and started chemo on the 17th August. Last chemo was Christmas Eve. I just had my last Herceptin jab, yay. What else do you know about your clinical reports ?  how large was the lump they extracted ? Carolyn xxx",

Oncotype DX tests a sample of the tumor (removed during a biopsy or surgery) for a group of 21 genes. that's a copy / paste from Google, basically, if you're having chemo to shrink the tumour they know there's a benefit to be gained, ie to make the tumour smaller and make the surgery less extensive (there must be a word for that?) or reduce the extent of surgery. The Oncotype test is for women who have really small tumours that can easily be removed with clear margins and it's been caught at an early stage. Chemotherapy isn't beneficial for everyone, some people only get a 1 or 2 % uplift in stats, and there's a considerable risk associated with it, much more than 1 or 2 % in most cases. does that help ?

      "Content": "morning Jilly I had funny poo for a while after chemo, and on Herceptin, and although I'm sure the doctors won't recommend this, I found red wine helped. Specifically good quality Spanish Rioja. Cheap wine is off limits. Go to a reliable wine store or try this tip I learned from my son. large supermarkets often have discounts and he simply looks for the biggest discount, so if it's a £6 wine for £5 that's not very good but a £12 wine for £6 should be excellent. Jilly Goolden said  years ago and it's still true, because the duty is added to imported wine at a flat rate of about £3 per bottle a £5 bottle of wine is actually £2 worth of wine, which is pretty cheap. Whilst I am a fan of trying the cheaper wines while in the country I don't advocate cheap wines in the UK. But even then I have had wine snobs tell me that anything under 20 quid is a cheap wine ... Wine in moderation can be beneficial and I guess if you force yourself to only drink wine that's a little more expensive you won't drink so much of it. I'm sure there's logic there somewhere. For the record, the reason I found out that red wine worked was last year on holiday the waiter recommended this wine which was really very good but he then took the bottle and put it aside for the next evening but then couldn't find it, so replaced it with a whole new bottle, so I had an extra glass. Then the next day I had 'normal' poo.  sorry too much info.  I think I used this trick a couple more times. hope that helps Carolyn xx",

Chemo is so unbelievably scary, but mostly it's an anticlimax, I didn't feel any different at all for the first 24 hours, except for the diarrhea and that responded to a codeine based painkiller.  I had a left mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction and it's fine, it took a while to get over the surgery, I had a lot of fluid build up, seroma, but it did settle down, also my first implant was way too big so I asked for a smaller one, now it's fine.

I found DHC worked for me, but other codeine derivatives didn't.  I was also given morphine sulphate in packs of 50, they worked on my taxane related bone pain quite well.  But again do cause constipation.   For constipation I used stoned fruit, all and any, which you can incorporate into the main diet, just extra for you, tinned peaches is a good standby when fresh stuff isn't available. Do you feed the baby apricots ? If the drug combination you're on isn't working it needs to be addressed, I remember when my mother in law was admitted to hospital she was on about 20 different meds, built up over 10 years or so, some of which were hopelessly out of date. My brother was prescribed a pain killer last year and one of his friends was so alarmed she took them off him, she works with the Samaritans and they'd noticed a clear link between this particular drug and suicidal tendencies ... that's how I remember it, seems surreal now but he was very glum when he was taking them. You can't just withdraw all at once, it needs to be managed quite carefully, and well worth having a good solid conversation with the new team. I am also in favour of minimal doses, which you can work out yourself with pain meds but you'll need guidance on the other meds you're taking. If you were the mum, the team would be working really hard to make sure you were still able to care for your baby. That might be a line of thinking when you next discuss it with the team ??

      "Content": "morning  welcome to the online community, sorry you've had to come and find us firstly I'm going to say don't panic, it's usually never as bad as we imagine and secondly treatments for breast cancer are the fasted evolving and there are plenty of treatments available. My GP did a pretty good job of reassuring me, although he likened me to a large ship with a small hole with all the pumps still working ... not so sure about the 'large' ship In 2015, whilst waiting my results, I was convinced my huge affected area was a vast tumour and since we knew it had been there since 2012, we could see it on the reviewed scans, it had probably travelled around my body. The team were very stern. But when I went back they were literally all smiles, they'd only found DCIS, that's the earliest stage . It was very weird at the time but with hindsight I realise why they were all so happy, it was a good outcome and although they warned me that things could change post mastectomy surgery, for the time being I was able to tell my children that it was \"nothing to worry about\".  My youngest son was 14 at the time.  A cancer diagnosis doesn't equal a death sentence and I really do blame the charity commercials for inflicting that on us. I can't predict the results but I can say that, for me, it wasn't as bad as I feared and there's a very good chance it won't be for you either hugs Carolyn xxxxx",

      "Content": "hi J jemilyxx  Today it feels really scary but as the days go by it will become less so, KerryCake posted recently that in 8 weeks you'll be dishing out advice to all the newbies on here. Personally I think it was easier to go through treatment myself, in my case mastectomy, and chemo, than have to watch someone else. On the whole I chose to attend meetings, appointments and treatment sessions on my own, but my daughter, 22, helped out by picking me up from the hospital after my surgery, for instance, they won't let you leave on your own. I know she worried about me having surgery, she said so, but I'm glad she told me. She also said some of her friends cried when she told them I had breast cancer, which I was upset about to begin with but they all ask me how I am, now I'm 7 months post treatment and my hair is starting to grow back. She also asked, frequently,  if I was going to die, and I'd smile and say , not yet. We had this little joke going all through chemo then, as I was shuffling around the house dressed in massive fleecy jackets and ugg boots,  she'd say are you dying and I'd say cheerfully, not yet. A few weeks ago I had a shocking cold, I felt really ill, and she said are you dying and I said 'yes' and she said, in mock horror, you're not supposed to say that ... we laughed. If she needs chemo you'll be able to help, it's important to keep on top of infections and checking her temperature is useful. My daughter kept reminding me to check mine. Eating is important too, getting good nutrition when you're too tired to stand up is tricky. She will want you to concentrate on your studies, how far away will you be when term starts again ? by the way, they grade invasive cancer cells 1 2 and 3, 3 being the most severe and hormone receptive cancers are easier to treat too. good luck to you both and fingers crossed for her MRI and results, hopefully she won't need chemo,  the helpline is available until 8pm tonight but not over the weekend, but we check in Saturdays and Sundays, unless the sun comes out  ; ) Carolyn x",

Mostly I did about 4000. I put on some soft trainers, waterproofs and a nice bobble hat and set off round my local park. It's about 10 mins to the park, 20 mins round and 10 mins back, at the far side is cemetery hill, which is pretty steep, I guess I am quite fit because I can walk up and down it a couple of times but with that I was achieving about 40 mins exercise per day, not elite athlete territory just cancer patient therapy style. It kept me sane, got me out in the fresh air, even got a bit of sunshine, it really helped, I always felt better the days I went than when I didn't.

I had no choice, being Her2+++ they pretty much tie you down, they consider you  insane for resisting. Thankfully I didn't get too sick, I didn't suffer neutropenic sepsis and my wig looked reasonably convincing, so I carried on semi normally. But my brain is still mushy, my business partner still resents the time I had to take off, my husband and I have grown apart, he thinks I look like a 'dyke' with my short grey hair, and his distain for my physical appearance has horrified me but I refuse to be depressed by it, I just booked a holiday in Sardinia on my own to get away from him. The children have been brilliant but it's been exceptionally tough on them. My youngest is just starting his exams but hopefully I have been able to rationalise his fears and he's on track but everyone noticed his attitude had changed and he openly admitted it was the chemotherapy, the exhaustion I experienced and the change to my appearance that worried him most. Everyone thinks I'm going to die, maybe not today or next week but sooner than they were expecting. Everyone is treating me differently. They all admit it's the chemotherapy that's the key factor. Strangers stare, small children hide and I didn't even look really ill. If it was my choice there's no way on earth I'd put myself through it. I think a 10% uplift is the minimum I'd consider. x tricky decision x but that's my advice for you x whatever you decide we will all support you x Carolyn",

I personally think that putting yourself through it is the safer option. Everyone is sympathetic and will support you in that it's the right thing to do to prevent recurrence. Not much is said or published about those who chose NOT to put themselves through it. I think the majority view us with suspicion and wait until they can say 'told you so'. But chemo is dangerous and can cause many more problems than it might solve, don't forget this is a mop up 'just in case' type treatment, all of you cancer is gone now. Even if you do put yourself through chemo the cancer can still come back, it doesn't play 'fair'. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2183545/Angel-Mostar-Sally-Becker-reveals-hero-soldier-saved-life-father-daughter-carrying-shot-masked-gunman.html This article is about Sally Becker and she chose  NOT to have chemo. And she is still happy with that decision. As are a few ladies on here. I called her and spoke with her and she said there was very little benefit so she said she didn't want it, and when she said it out loud her onco agreed with her. He said that since her margins were clear and nothing had spread to her lymph nodes it wasn't really necessary. She was more than happy to trade emails and we had a 30 minute phone conversation. If your other tumour turns out to be Her2+++ the problem of making that decision goes away. But if not, I'd not put my body through it. x",

BUT be prepared to talk to your BCN about alternatives. With the NHS options you can be referred pretty much wherever you like, wherever you feel happy, this is not a walk in the park. I had issues with the Royal Marsden but overall there wasn't a day where I felt \"please don't make me go there\". The nurses were pretty cheerful even though the schedule was filled to bursting point. They made me feel welcome and remembered my name and asked me how I was. Even doctor 'Tazer' smiled eventually. The PICC line made a massive difference as it took away all the stress of finding veins. The first couple of sessions I wasn't that well prepared and had to snack on biscuits but after that I took a selection of fruit and veg with dips from M&S.

Lastly, this headline \"forget walking 10k steps\"  is click bate.  The article doesn't say 'forget', it says that alternatives may be as beneficial, and easier to accomplish,  for getting out of breath and raising the heart rate.  On the basis, if it's easy we are more likely to stick with it, if it's hard and unachievable we give up.  I advocate walking briskly for as far, as long, or as many steps as you want to, or can manage, and if you can work in a hill or two, so much the better.

It does sound like a lumpectomy would have been sufficient for you but for the nodes I'm imagining that if you'd done as I did and refused full clearance they'd have had to go back a couple of times, 5 is a funny number, luckily my 1 node was clear but if it had been affected they'd have pushed for another op and full clearance and I would have probably had to agree, I don't think they will take one at a time. Sometimes their arguments in favour of extensive treatment do sound very short term solutions without even a nod to long term implications, even though the statistics show surgery on its own is pretty effective. I know that for 50% of women in my situation surgery will be sufficient, so for them suffering long term consequences of lymphedema, can't spell that, leukaemia, lymphoma, neuropathy, etc etc etc is wretched BUT since we don't know which of us will be lucky and which will be unlucky it becomes either a risk we have to take or a burden we have to bear.  roll on the day they have a test for that !

I was going to try the cold cap but it took so long to get everything signed off, on that first day, we were running out of time and using the cold cap adds an hour to the treatment time. I opted for same day blood test so arrive, give blood, wait 2 hours, then treatment first they give you an anti sickness shot, wait 20 mins, then you have the infusion of drugs, I had EC so first hour was the E or Epirubicin then the 2nd hour was C or Cyclophosphamide, then they flush the lines, about 15 mins. it's a whole day affair ! Half a day if you're local to the unit. I think it's easier to just say my hair is going to fall out, I will be upset, I will cry, but I will wear a nice bobble hat or wig and it will grow back. I tried scarves but since it was getting chilly going into September I found bobble hats perfect. Elasticated turbans seem okay. When I got my husband to give me a #2 all over I tried the wig on and everyone agreed it looked fine, it took a bit of getting used to but it did the job.

That was 1st July 2015 and I didn't start chemo until the 17th August. Is that about 7 weeks ? Nobody was concerned about that level of delay.  In my head I worried that the extended length of time from biopsy on the 8th May which was more than 12 weeks was more significant but I have to take comfort in the fact my staging scans from 7th August were clear. My wound hadn't completely healed by the time I began chemo but sufficiently for the team to give the go ahead. I wouldn't worry yet, it does sound as if the team are on top of things. Could you help me out with your pathology detail though ?  I can see from your profile you had a lumpectomy but from the post here have had a mastectomy.  I realise I'm missing some key info about whether you're hormone positive or Her2 etc. I'm on my iPad otherwise I'd have investigated a few threads to see how you've progressed  Chat later Carolyn  X",

Here's mine for comparison. I was very reluctant but I had to accept that the chemotherapy offered me a considerable improvement in my chances, we used two variants on the tumour size as there were two areas of disease, the Predict tool doesn't allow for that yet,  and they wanted to show me the benefits, 50mm is a 'tipping point' and with Her2 + the lymph involvement is considered more sinister too. Here's three screen shots showing the comparison.  Don't forget I was missed in 2012 so had 3 years of progression before I paid to have a private screening as I wasn't happy being fobbed off with \"it's your hormones\".

However once I did manage to get to see the team it turned out to be DCIS which is stage 0 and despite being over 50mm non life threatening, so they were all smiles.  Let's hope that this is what you have, if indeed it turns out to be cancer of any description.  I did have to have a mastectomy because the affected area to good boob ratio was going to make it cosmetically difficult . This roller coaster ride we refer to is terrible for the nerves and you will have to endure some ups and downs, I did eventually go to my GP and got some Lorazepam. hope that helps Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi Sacha I really really didn't want chemo, and like you, I felt that once the cancer had been surgically removed that was it But I had Her2+ breast cancer and I was told that I'd be insane not to have chemo, the oncologist even threatened to lock me in the room if I refused. So I agreed and signed the consents. I'm still here. It didn't hurt that much and when it did I had some good painkillers, the worst pain was bone pain in my left shin. I wasn't sick but that was probably because the sickness meds doing their job. I was incredibly tired but thankfully my family allowed me to sleep. My daughter insisted I check my temperature several times a day and we made sure my exposure to germs was limited. It is a good idea to get a dental checkup and tell them you'll be going through chemo, whatever your dental hygiene ritual is, double it. We have a monthly chemo club in the breast group where you can chat to people like you. please be reassured that they don't do this for fun, as my sons girlfriend said to me when I was wailing like a toddler, they are not doing this to you just to piss you off, they're doing it to save your life. I calmed down after that. nutrition is vital to get you through, especially when your taste senses will be numbed or confused and you don't fancy eating, having said that, steroids make you hungry I'm the worlds biggest wimp but I got through it and you can too.

I was happier than I'd been in a while and it did feel like someone pulling a rug from under me, with a deep dark void underneath it And I wanted to run away, but my husband said I was being selfish.  It takes a while for it all to sink in that's for sure.

Until someone changes that, with equal emphasis. so if you have a 3% advantage and a 3% risk, what you actually have is 'evens', ergo no benefit if you have a 2% advantage and a 3% risk you actually have a negative or -1%, or a summary -1% risk therefore chemotherapy offer not just 0% benefit it's actually worse than that it's minus -1% The oncologists shouldn't even be putting it on the table as an option, should they. how can I explain it in even more graphic terms Russian roulette .  involves a revolver with 6 chambers, one of which holds a bullet, the risk is 1 in 6 you'll kill yourself if the revolver has 100 chambers and 3 of them have bullets in would you even contemplate playing the game ????  no because the risk is too great. you guys already have a 95% chance of walking away from the breast cancer roulette table I know it sounds tempting to up the chances to 98% but chemotherapy actually offers no benefit when compared to the risk. I think it is really hard to go against the flow, that's why I advocate for it being okay to say no to chemo. hugs Carolyn xxx",

I , however , found out the hard way that although my husband had always loudly proclaimed that his earnings and pension would see us into our old age, I know now this isn't the case. When I hit hard times a few years ago he pretty much turned his back, clamped his wallet firmly shut and got really quite nasty about money. I guess he showed his true colours. I ended up spending most of my savings replacing my income to support the house and kids. To add insult, he told everyone, including the kids, that he was having to work doubly hard to support me. I cannot tell you how stressful that was on top of an already hideous situation. You say you're scared of being skint. Could you squeeze another year and carefully stash some cash ? hugs Carolyn xx",

I had no breast cancer symptoms back in 2012 but felt generally unwell and although the staff member conducting my routine mammogram that September pursed her lips the mammogram came back 'clear'. Roll on 2015 and I had a massive 75mm affected area, more a layer than a lump, but was mortified at how I could have missed it.  But keep in mind that I'd pestered my GP practice for months and had been told it was my age and my hormones and therefore nothing to worry about. So when people say to me 'look out for symptoms' I have zero faith in my ability to recognize what's sinister and what's not and to be able to convince anyone that it might be serious. I think I'm going to ask for a full set of scans in early 2017, around the 2 year mark from the self pay private breast screen that actually detected the cancer, which hopefully will be clear, but will give me a clean slate to work from .

I'm presuming your sentinel node wasn't clear, hence clearance and you're under 50, dense breasts in the under 50s needs ultrasound as well as mammogram but you're already being offered MRI, which is very good, and very reassuring. I was much more disturbed by my wound refusing to heal than starting chemo but I didn't find I definitely needed chemo until 3 weeks post mastectomy. So 21st July to 17th August is about 4 weeks and in that time I couldn't see my scar healing, it was just an open wound, although it did stop oozing eventually. In fact it had only really just settled down in Feb this year, just before they opened me up again for the revision. But the second scar is much better and healed almost instantly, that was 8 weeks from last chemo which was Christmas Eve. more questions, sorry 1. Lymph node clearance ... how many affected ? 2. What are they offering ? 3 x FEC and 3 x T   ??   and have they already started you on Tamoxifen or other ? 3. did you post on here as being borderline for chemo ? let me know please Carolyn x",

I'm now 12 weeks post chemo and have about 1cm of hair plus my eyebrows and lashes have all bounced back. I did have a lengthy regime though, 4 x EC every 3 weeks and 4 x T every two weeks, started August, finished Christmas, but took until the end Jan to feel less exhausted. It sounds like you have a good team who are going to look after you. My radio doc said that we breast cancer patients are 'difficult' because we don't think we're ill. I said I didn't feel ill hence it was difficult to accept the 'treatment', she said breast cancer patients don't feel ill, although the chemo can make you feel a bit rough. Let me know how the rest of the meetings go, I'm intrigued by the similarities / differences in treatment options. Find out if they have a the version of predict tool too !! Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi all I took my new boob on a beach holiday but I had to wait until after chemo. I had left mx in  July 2015 then chemo from August to Christmas.  Went away first in February 2016 as needed some sunshine. Was in the Canary Islands and it wasn't super hot, more like spring but was careful to wear a sunhat as had no hair and factor 30. Once I'd had some revision surgery I got myself some nice balconette bikinis and nobody ever batted an eyelid.  Underwired are tolerable for short periods of time but I am currently wearing a new Tesco sports bra / crop top. I have to say it does the job, I'm 36B/C and look even under clothes and it is very comfortable and so are their seam free knickers, I may have to go back and buy more before they change the range. Intrigued by the Victorias Secret no wire ones, will have to look them up. hugs to all Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "hi Spinningrose65 I was a bit anxious about my hair too, the stats are good overall that most of us do get our hair back but there is a few who don't My experience was that I finished chemo Christmas Eve 2015 and by around week 9 my head started to look like a '5'o'clock shadow', I have dark hair, my eyelashes also popped back quickly, I didn't lose all my eyebrows but they were and still are very sparse. From then my hair grew back very slowly, nowhere near 1 inch.  I have one photo of me in around April time with very short slate grey hair which is typical 'chemo', I recognised it on a lot of women in the hospital.  by about June I had dyed it dark brown and experimented with styling gels so I didn't feel like a chemo victim, by then it was short and curly and someone said you'd never know it was inflicted it just looked like my choice of style. Worryingly it was thick and curly at the back but still fairly sparse on top but not that noticeable to other people, just me being over sensitive.  I'm 55 and now have shoulder length dark brown hair which is not dissimilar to how I looked prior to the breast cancer diagnosis, except the last inch is still a bit curly, which I quite liked but next hair cut the will be gone.  Does that help ??

DCIS is early stage breast cancer, or stage 0, and is usually treated with surgery, WLE, which is wide local excision, or mastectomy, if it's a large area, like mine. Then if the pathology is favourable you might be advised to have a bit of radiotherapy which is specifically targeted or if it shows up hormone receptors or Her2 markers or if it has spread to the lymph nodes then you usually will be advised to have chemo. There is a cold cap which helps to avoid hair loss, and it can be quite effective. any more questions just ask, we've all had to get through this fraught first fortnight take a few mins to fill in your profile, if you haven't already done so, it helps us direct you, there's another group for under 50s , for instance higs Carolyn x",

I saw my GP or the day unit doctor and got good pain killers, nobody cares whether you're a hero or a wimp on chemo, get the good drugs, I used DHC and even had some morphine sulphate tablets, the oramorph made me gag. I also had some anti anxiety meds which help you relax and sleep, they're kinder than sleep meds.  LOT is the way to remember them.  Lorazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam.   I was given 3 Lorazepam once.

But when my hair started to grow it kept slipping so I abandoned it. And people didn't recognise me, then they were saying stupid things to cover the awkwardness.

      "Content": "catchpole I agree.i was lucky enough not to have chemo so I didn't lose my hair but when I was first diagnosed, the thought of losing my hair was the thing that upset me most.I was even accused of being so vain by friends,  I spose because I was in my 60s and single I m not supposed to care how I look, well I do.I grew my hair when I was just over 60, id had short hait for years,but this \"older women shouldn't have long hair\" wound me up so much,i decided to grow it,and as my brunette locks had bits of grey, I dyed it red,  I love it, I vowed never to cut it short again just have regular trims so thought of losing it uspet me so much, Im sure all these people are well meaning  with this \"brave the shave\" but I hate it,To be honest im not keen on the other adverts for cancer, I hated the last years one where the bloke sits in an icy wasteland and the caption \"cancer is such a lonely thing\" comes up.  Totally depressing, Lets have a few more positive adverts and campaigns, Cancer is bad enough we dont need all this downbeat stuff, Hi catchpole, I totally with you on the \"60's and single and not supposed to care\" I met up with one of my friends mums just recently and she's in her 80's and I'm not being judgemental but she'd lost a front tooth and I just felt, when did you let your standards slip? She was always so well turned out , tall, elegant, beautiful, sophisticated, educated, intelligent, and up to speed on private dentistry for sure. !!! I thought there'd be a time when it didn't matter, at that moment I realised it's not the case, it will always matter. I love the fact you grew your hair and dyed it red.  Reminds me of an aunt who was, and actually still is, the most glamorous woman I've ever met. Also well into her 80's now. I wore a wig throughout chemo and nobody even realised I was ill. It wasn't until I finished and my hair started to grow that I stopped wearing the wig because it was slipping and besides I figured it 'didn't matter' how wrong I was people looked right through me none of the nurses in the MDU recognised me !!  I'd been on first name terms with them throughout my treatment, 5 whole months, and they just didn't realise it was me. Our hair is such a defining part of us.  It really does allow others to recognise us and interact with us. It is a critical part of our being. No wonder we freak out at the thought of it all falling out . And when was it clever to make people cry to get them to donate ?  People are going to die if you don't give us money. Surely it is more witty, clever and amusing to say, a lot more people will survive if you do give us money, without the 'they're gonna die if you don't' undertones. These creative agencies don't give their time for nothing !!!  they're all on BIG BUCKS contracts for this 'easy tears' stuff. make them accountable to us, the 'clients' make them applaud the fact that most people get a lot of essential emotional support via crowd sourced peer to peer routes I'm not saying that it's wrong to shave your head to show support, but as they say, people do that anyway.

I absolutely agree with the breast comment When I knew I was going to have to have a mastectomy I did attempt to find a surgeon with a good aesthetic record. It was really hard. There was such a lot of horror inspiring images. I'm actually not going to post the full response I was going to because it will frighten the life out of people. However now I have a reasonable reconstruction I'm tempted to show what is possible and allow women to be a bit more proactive in their treatment options once the cancer is treated and they are left to get on with their lives. There are a lot of surgeons out there, some very, very good ones. Let's take an analogy of a wedding dress, I want to have a wedding dress made for me. I go to several meetings with wedding dress makers, I look at their designs and testimonials from previous work I then select the dress maker who I believe will make the best dress for me. I will then go to several measuring and fitting sessions before the dress is made. Once it's made I will go back for any small tweaks necessary. The dressmaker will at all times be committed to making sure I'm completely delighted with my dress. Hands up anyone who had that level of service from their surgeon ? Carolyn x",

As I said at the time, if it costs £5m to raise £4m questions do need to be asked. The charities are accountable. The consensus seemed to be that the well meaning public would raise money in this way anyway, it's a very popular way of fundraising, if that's the case I don't see why they need to advertise it further ?? There are clever adverts on the television and in digital media, ones that make you stop and think but without relying on the fear factor or campaigns that break the hearts of the very people Macmillan are attempting to help. I personally don't like any cancer adverts, I found it very awkward having to endure them whilst watching anything with my family after my diagnosis and during treatment. The underlying message always seems to be 'people will die if you don't donate' and in those months that person was me. It's frightening and it's unfair to inflict that on us on top of everything else. In that respect Brave the Shave is merely offensive. Anyway, it's probably one of Sir Martin Sorrell's companies and we know what a marvelous chap he is. anyone want his email address ? hugs to all Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "Jess - Admin Hi everyone, We passed this discussion onto our Brave the shave fundraising team and here is their response - Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this forum. We appreciate all feedback as it helps us to grow and to support more people affected by cancer.  Please accept our apologies if the campaign has caused any upset or offence, Brave the Shave was created in order to raise awareness and vital funds for Macmillan and we understand the sensitive nature of the campaign. Brave the Shave started as we found that many Macmillan supporters were choosing to shave their head and fundraise for Macmillan. Originally we launched Shave or Style, however from this campaign, we found that the majority of participants were opting to shave and so moved forward with that aspect specifically. We wanted to provide these supporters with a better platform in order to raise money, while sharing their fundraising activity. The majority of people who take part in Brave the Shave have a close connection to cancer, including the ladies in our TV ad. We do understand that this type of event is not for everyone, which is why we offer a variety of events, including Coffee Morning, Go Sober and Summer Lights. We also of course are continually trying to improve and check our communication with this particular ask, which is why yours and participants feedback here is so important.   Last year this event raised over £4m to support people affected by cancer, which means we can continue to be there for more people affected by cancer than ever before. We hope this response has eased some of your concerns, and please do let us know if you have any further comments or queries, you can email us at bravetheshave@macmillan.org.uk http://www.macmillan.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-annual-report-and-accounts/how-we-raise-and-spend-our-money.html perhaps if you spent a little less than £25.1m on making people aware, Campaigning & Awareness,  they wouldn't have to shave their heads, as part of a campaign we all find offensive, to raise £4m I find pretty much all cancer adverts debatable in their effectiveness and dubious in their tactics. I, for one, would be interested to see how that £25.1m is being spent. I love the online group, I've benefitted and I hope I've helped others.  Work hard to improve what we find useful and ask us to help you come up with ideas to raise awareness that isn't going to reduce our families to tears at unexpected moments in the ad breaks in our favourite TV shows.

Are you still on Herceptin ?  or have they stopped that to reconsider the therapies or combinations ? After that you can of course feel free to compare notes with others in a similar situation, either in the secondary breast group or any of the head and neck groups. are the mets only in your brain or are other areas affected, or don't you know yet ? big hugs, I have a million questions but I'll save them call your GP and see if you can get some help today good luck Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "hi Luciana1  I only really joined in because I felt strongly that the cancer adverts we see on the television and in digital media don't help us in our mission to take away the fear of a cancer diagnosis, the 'omg I'm going to die' wave of emotion that sweeps over us, the blow that we're here to soften. That and the fact that it is usually fairly easy to check the hows/whys/wherefores of a campaign and with the charities being accountable, you can see the gross spend, although not the breakdown. I didn't see Brave the Shave initially, so I didn't really have a comment but I saw other people commenting here and totally agreed with them that there is nothing particularly brave about shaving your head and I didn't appreciate that my son had felt slightly pressured to comply AND had felt the need to apologise for not offering, that's clearly wrong. I didn't want him to shave his head and I was stunned that he even thought it might be the right thing to do, because of these adverts. The biggest issue I had was nobody recognised me when my hair started to grow back and it's very strange when people you know quite well struggle to identify you or look right through you. Put any one of these people on the spot with a consent form to allow chemotherapy and see just how funny it is, let's see who's brave then !!  Personally I think it's much braver to decline chemotherapy but that's debated on another thread. Generally I think that there are some very clever and creative people in the advertising industry and none of the adverts have come close to demonstrating any level of intelligence in their approach. Any idiot can make people scared, it cheapens the craft by playing on fear. That is just my opinion, it's not Macmillan's. From Macmillan's point of view it raises much needed cash and why would they work harder than they need to? I think they should listen to public opinion and I am surprised to see this campaign running again this year in what appears to be an unchanged format. What annoys me even more than that though is seeing so many people having to self-fund treatment, it appears none of the charities fund raise to pay for treatment and what is the point of continually raising money for research if the fabulous new drugs sit on the shelf out of patients financial reach ? I'll put my soapbox away now the Champ role here is to welcome and guide people to the right place for good quality information and peer support in a time of distress, rather than championing the views on advertising strategies, if that makes sense ? we're volunteers and we're home based, I've only met a handful of Macmillan staff Carolyn xx",

If you'd put together a campaign and even 1 person complained, you'd pull it, or be under pressure to quit. I don't like any of the cancer ads. So I have learned to look away but I can't make my kids look away every time. I'd bet my eyesight the TV channels don't give their air time for nothing and there's plenty of ad / design agencies making a nice living out of charitable work too, we tried to pitch for some but it's locked down by the big guns, that's when you realise how profitable it is. We know half of the advertising budget is wasted but we don't know which half, I can't remember who said that ... It's the level of complaints from the people that matter in this thread that I find irresistible and I don't understand the desire to 'fob us off' and actually, £4m in funds isn't enough to make me think that it's worth offending so many, not when you consider how much is spent to achieve it. If they can offer a transparent explanation perhaps we could agree to close our eyes and ears to it. like I said, there's a lot of good they do, which we are happy to accept but we're the end user, we're the CLIENT here, and the client is always right. the accounts are posted, so the info is freely available, if you understand corporate accounts. www.macmillan.org.uk/.../how-we-raise-and-spend-our-money.html",

      "Content": "here here I'm glad you have spoken out because you probably have a unique view on the subject My biggest issue was that I found a fabulous wig and wore it throughout chemo, therefore looking pretty much 'normal'. So nobody batted an eyelid and we all got on with things, which is fine, other than I was knackered, and desperately needed support but didn't look like I needed it. Then when chemo was over and my hair was growing back and I felt a lot better, my wig wouldn't stay on my head, so I stopped wearing it. It was the most bizarre and disconcerting experience of my life. The nurses whom I'd been on first name terms with for 6 months looked right through me. A young friend looked petrified when this strange looking women approached him, think online grooming or pedophiles, he hid behind his mother. and so it went on thankfully because I felt I was over the worst I could laugh about it, sort of, but it was a gut wrenching experience. I also avoided cancer adverts as they reduced me and my kids to tears, it was quite horrific to have to answer their inquiring glances. It is NOT big and NOT clever to make us cry to get us to empty our wallets these agencies who charge mega bucks to produce this easy cop out content ought to be made to work harder for their cash let's make it about providing cash to help people who are struggling to look after their families and can't navigate the social security system in light of a cancer diagnosis, they're not going to die but it will take some months for them to get better yes we do need research yes we do need more targeted therapies yes we do need kinder chemotherapy but we also need long term solutions for people who are living with cancer, not dying from it people who need to work and don't need the stigma a stage 4 diagnosis brings adverts that promote inclusion adverts that say we can survive without just paying lip service to the idea we need clever people with clever ideas, real ad men / women not the current crop of scaremongers with their tearjerkers forget the hair, forget the headgear, it's too obvious and too much of an easy option work harder to earn the public's respect not their sympathy hugs to all Carolyn xx",

But. I was advised to have chemo because my Her2+++ breast cancer is very likely to recur and chemo represents a huge benefit in terms of survival to five and ten years. So I did. But I took a lot of convincing and involved my family and they wanted me to do as advised. FrancesW decided against and I have just tagged her using the @ symbol to attract her attention. Hopefully she'll have a bit of time over the weekend to make contact and talk you through her decision making. It will be her own personal account and her own views, Macmillan do not advocate any treatments or refusing treatments, rather supporting you in your decision making, providing a safe group environment to ask questions and debate options. Whatever you decide we are here for you. I could do with a little more information about your diagnosis, 1b is only a small part or it. If they have offered chemo and tamoxifen I'll presume you are PR and or ER+. Have you had surgery? One lump or two? Please do keep in mind that surgery is by far and away the most successful way of treating breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is  belt and braces. The Tamoxifen actually might be the one that for you offers the best chance or remaining cancer free.

      "Content": "hi Kitkat59  I remember being very reluctant to have chemo but in the end I agreed, it was what the experts recommended and my family all said that if the experts recommended it then I ought to go through it. They said they'd be supportive. Trouble was that if I put on my wig and some makeup I didn't look ill, and they didn't treat me as if I was ill. So I got precious little support.  But with Her2, although the stats indicated an almost 30% uplift in my chances of surviving to 5 and 10 years, there really are no guarantees. I'm just about to get my penultimate jab of the 18 monoclonal antibody treatments, herceptin/trastuzumab but read that \"if the patient has no recurrence during that time ... \"  I always got the impression the team were expecting it to come back and were just watching and waiting. I finished chemo on Christmas Eve 2015. Even now I look nothing like I did before. I was young, optimistic and focused. If I had £1 for every time someone said I didn't look my age I'd be very wealthy. Now I look every day of my 54 years, if not 5 or 10 years older. I weigh a few pounds more and I swear I've shrunk. With my curly grey hair I look the classic granny. My husband cannot hide his disappointment. Not about the fact I am unlucky enough to have cancer but to have apparently turned into his mother. Part of me wishes I had stood my ground and refused chemotherapy, most of the long term survivors I read about had just surgery to remove tumours, I'm still not convinced by any long term statistics regarding chemotherapy. The experts themselves regard 10 years as a huge success. Having said that, my tumour did shrink with the EC. Ergo it must work. Thing is, after they've administered that first dose you may as well carry on. That was my philosophy. My onc said she could have reduced my taxol/paclitaxol by 50% but that if I could tolerate it it would give me the best chance chemo could offer, no point in doing it by half measures. It doesn't last forever. I honestly struggle to remember how I felt, apart from the constipation. If you want one small snippet, which may help, my onc said \"nobody uses 'F' anymore\"  I had the EC but no F. If you're on the same regime as me, ask for the 4th FEC to be without the F.  Then perhaps go for a reduced dose of T ? T was overall easier for me and went much quicker, being every 2 weeks rather than 3 . My left shin bone hurt and my toes were painful but DHC worked for me, apart from the constipation, but you just need to keep on top of that. Stoned fruit works. And oxazepam for the jitters and to get some rest. There's no point giving up now, as that Mastermind guy says, I've started so I'll finish. Or more amusingly, my dr said I should finished what I started, so today I finished a bottle of red wine, a pack of cheese, a packet of biscuits .... that was doing the rounds on Facebook a while ago, it's reasonably amusing. You're only 57. I'm only 54. I wanted to make 60. I found another stats site today that said I have another 6.3 years.  Actually, I'll take that. I have an aunt who is 93. She wants her telegram from the Queen. We have the same amount of time, me to 60, her to 100. We need to make the most of it. I'm not ready to die just yet. I can't 'undo' the fact i have cancer. I'm on the roller coaster now, I can't get off until it stops, I might as well make the most of it. I'm off to Thailand next week, flying on the Emirates A380 in business class. My treat to myself. I have a lot of living to do and a long bucket list.",

Or, UCLH is linked to UCL and has a student accommodation list, likewise the other teaching hospitals. The rooms are very basic but usually comfortable and clean.  I booked myself on a 06.00 flight from Luton which required a 03.00 start, I thoroughly enjoyed the break so it was worth it, but I'm not a morning person so booked myself into student rooms in Luton about half a mile from the airport. Small but had everything I needed, kitchenette, shower, loo, smallish double bed, table and chair. I think it was about 40 quid for the night but they wanted a cleaning fee which then bumps the price up but much less stress than being an hour from the airport.  (if mistymoley is reading this, I can't do Luton Airport in under and hour, I've no idea why and i've tried several routes) My boobs haven't changed but did moisturise when I remembered, not great on manicures either, or attaching fake eyelashes. I do expect my implant / reconstructed boob to change over time, they did say that, but more down to gravity. Get it checked and come back to me for more ideas on reasonable accommodation so it's less stressful. Carolyn x",

      "Content": "hi LondonLass  could you get a doctors or consultant letter to verify you're finished treatment and are fit for work ? mine was going to give me a letter to say I was fit to have some vaccinations. Remind them of the 3 month trial period, in the nicest possible way, you then have 3 months to prove you're capable? I must admit to being a bit put off when two candidates for one job admitted to having had stress issues and had taken time off work, eventually leading to an agreement to separation, hence looking for new job. The stress can occur at any time and is unpredictable and can cause issues with the rest of the team. We had plenty of young fit and healthy applicants who were better suited and we weren't a charity set up to help afflicted people, so I didn't have any reason for feeling bad. But cancer is a bit different and once you're through treatment you need a way to move on, or even if you're on continuous treatment that keeps everything under control, I've coped with taking 1 day off per 3 weeks to get a jab and I wouldn't imagine that being a problem. It's a known quantity, you can plan around it. Of course it's tempting to say nothing. I guess the other alternative might be do a month volunteering to prove your stamina, but hopefully these interviews will get you the job. let me know if any of this is helpful ? Carolyn x",

For me the 'annual' was the wrong date but it was too soon, in my opinion.   I can't remember the run of things now but I was still in 'active' treatment, as far as I was concerned, they'd been checking me and I'd had several ultrasound examinations.  Plus I could see the day when I'd finished the 'active' treatment and no longer being the centre of attention, which is exactly how I feel now, funnily enough. so I had the mammogram and ultrasound and biopsy on May 8th 2015 and I think the team scheduled the 'annual' mammogram for June 2016 but I'd only just had the results of the 2nd surgery, for which I'd had quite  a few ultrasound exams.  It just felt like a waste of time and wouldn't show anything, and it didn't. They then spoke in terms of symptoms, but I didn't have symptoms back in 2012 when we know the tumour was there, certainly none of the classic symptoms, I did feel unwell but nobody said 'let's check for breast cancer' and by Sept 2012 I'd had the routine mammogram and it was 'clear'. Do you have symptoms ? Did you have symptoms before ? I don't think you need to worry, easier said than done, I know but this is a principle and you feel you're being messed around so I think you're well within your rights to ask politely for an appointment that falls into the 12 month bracket. call the helpline first and have a good cry THEN call PALS, you'll have had a dress rehearsal  : ) 0808 808 0000  hugs Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "The great diet debate ! no sooner had I posted that http://www.katherinealbrecht.com/blog/that-email-about-chinese-women-not-getting-breast-cancer-has-it-wrong/  this lady seems almost to have a go at Prof Plant on a personal level, but still makes some fairly valid points I'm the opposite, ronstar, I could have been the poster girl for how not to do it, was always going to end up with something but like I said, breast cancer wasn't on my list. I didn't like food when I was younger, I was the original fussy eater, and I had a mortal fear of stew. School dinners were a nightmare, had the dinner lady stand over me every day until I \"cleared my plate\" which I never did, just missed out on play time. The only food I liked was roast dinner, so I ate once a week. Although thinking back, I would eat almost anything with mint sauce, she missed a trick on that. And raw veg, my aunt said, if all she'll eat is raw veg give her that, but it didn't happen, I just used to hang around the kitchen and steal them before they were cooked. She only got cross about the peas though, it takes so long to shell enough for a meal. My mum actually said out loud, I hope all your kids are fussy eaters, then you'll realise what you put me through. I think she missed the point, my kids eat anything I put in front of them, they're so grateful when I cook and don't burn it. I didn't give them mashed potato because I don't like it, it was quite funny when they eventually experienced it. As for dairy, don't like cheese, hate yogurt, never drink milk except in tea and coffee. Like butter on toast and cream on cake but keep to a min. It wasn't until I was quite hungry and all there was to eat was rabbit and boiled potatoes that I realised I was missing out. I despair of mums with kids with special diets now, even the fussiest eaters on the planet will eat when they're starving. *nod to peanut allergies but to be fair, peanuts were only a cash crop for the Americans, along with the mass corn planting for cheap calories. Don't get me started on modified corn syrup. anyway, I'm all for the little bit of everything these days, who said that ?  and Karen's small changes, I need to eat more fish. And organic, we use too many pesticides etc etc etc For me I think stress is and was the biggest deciding factor, that solo trip to Sardinia did me the world of good. Carolyn x",

      "Content": "personally I'd put 50p on \"maintaining regular hydration\" as being absolutely fine will be the standard response. They tell us in the UK, and I'm sure they tell you in France too, that before having bloods taken it is vital to be hydrated . So I work hard to make sure I sip water, at least 500mls, over the hour prior to the test. It helps the nurses find the veins. If nothing else I'm being considerate. Also whilst on chemo being well hydrated helps flush things through and helps prevent blood clots. so we know the importance, we get it I know, however, that I don't drink enough water, or squash or juice or anything really, I manage about 500mls per day, possibly a small orange juice on top of that. I drink wine with dinner and usually a glass of water too. Current thinking is 1.6L https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/hydration/healthy-hydration-guide.html The thing I like about this article is, it says it depends on who you are, what you are doing and what the weather is up to. FAB ! At last a common sense approach. Switch it around. Why are they testing your creatinine levels? It is to do with vital organ function, so I'm going to hazard a guess that 'normal' is what they want to test, so 'normal' is how they want your hydration levels to be. There's no point in artificially hydrating yourself, is there ?  or conversely dehydrating yourself. the team can then guide you if you need a bit more or a bit less make sense ? Carolyn xxx",

See how you feel and talk to the nurses, I asked for my bloods sheet at every session, it was fascinating. Further down that article it does say about the amount of water it's possible to get from fruit and vegetables, bear that in mind too. I lived on melon, or so it seemed, that would account for a lot of my fluids. xx Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "chance1960 Hi Carolyn 28 I am going off the original blog but was wondering what your Her+++ diagnosis is.  I have not seen this before and am intrigued to know what it is. Chance1960 hi chance1960  when I was first diagnosed they could only find DCIS, the earliest stage of breast cancer, effectively stage 0, I'd never even heard of it. So they weren't considering chemo, DCIS doesn't respond to chemo, on the whole. But I had a large area that wasn't possible to give a good aesthetic result with a lumpectomy so mastectomy was the consensus. Post mastectomy I knew there was a risk of finding invasive breast cancer cells within the breast tissue under the microscope, and I would therefore be upgraded / downgraded depending on your viewpoint. The breast tissue is tested for a range of things like how fast the cells are growing and how poorly they are differentiated from normal cells, that gives you your grade, low, medium and high (sometimes 1,2 and 3), and how large the affected area or tumour is and whether it's spread gives you the stage, 0,1,2,3,4.  (sometimes referred to as TNM  link ) They also check for hormone receptors and the human growth hormone, Her2.  (FISH) These results give you your profile, ER positive or negative, PR positive or negative, ER and PR positive, Her2 positive (Her2+++) or negative. Some people are triple positive and some triple negative. ER and PR positive cancers are treated with hormone therapy, Tamoxifen, Anastrozole or Letrozole. Sometimes chemotherapy is recommended, if there's node involvement or multiple tumours, large tumours, but if you have a smallish tumour with no node involvement chemotherapy offers little benefit, 1 or 2% and chemo carries a 10% risk, that's for ALL cancers, ALL patients, much lower for breast cancer because we're easier to manage as a group, we turn up for appointments, we take our medications, we check our temp. and take more precautions against infections. It is for each individual to assess their own risk v benefit , with their specialist teams. Her2+++ are treated with the monoclonal antibody Herceptin or Trastuzumab.  And also , so I'm told, always chemo. no choice. My Her2 score was high +++ and I'm also PR and ER negative. The chemotherapy regime I was put on was for stage 3 cancers, they threw the kitchen sink at me. But I'm still here  yay ! Carolyn x",

Yes raised levels are present but it may well be that that is the body's defense mechanism rather than the culprit. Personally I am committed to rectifying the lack of readily available information about the tiny amounts of minerals and trace elements that we know are essential in our diet. I was all soapboxy about sugar but everyone's shouting about that nowadays, although Tesco's  stocking the fake sugar variety of squashes in place of the real sugar is a pain in the bum, I'm allergic to sweeteners and I don't like the kids ingesting too much. Anyway, I know I need to eat potassium and I know bananas are a good source. What I didn't know was that potassium plays a vital role in close motor control, I only found that out because I couldn't pick up a bar of chocolate of a table. It also affects moods. Chemotherapy strips out everything and I watched my blood reports as my levels sank steadily and realised I needed to act. I try and tell everyone to eat a balanced healthy diet but to eat as much variety as possible, but just in small quantities. As my husband helpfully pointed out to one of his colleagues who was juicing and smoothie-ing to help him lose weight but wasn't. When would you eat a banana and an apple and an avocado and a peach in one go. That's a bit simplistic. I think the point I'm trying to make is eat one or two nuts, you don't need a whole pack, I couldn't tolerate nuts and seeds in my mouth during chemo, I kept biting my cheeks and tongue, I was almost in tears but when I put them into porridge it worked better, but you don't put a whole pack into the porridge, just one or two and a sprinkling of seeds.  That then creates storage issues and freshness issues then you have to spend a fortune at Lakeland ... that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it Carolyn x",

Women in East African countries have low rates of breast cancer but they also don't live very long, for a variety of reasons, latterly down to infections of neglected tropical diseases, according to the World Health Organization.

      "Content": "afternoon all Jenjen30  firstly go with your instincts I felt generally unwell for a good while, 2011 - 2014 but had had every scan and test done and nothing was found anywhere, my routine mammogram in 2012 was 'clear'. I then had a premonition that I wouldn't see Christmas.  This was in early 2015.  It was so alarming I almost burst into tears but I shook myself and reasoned that I had had every test what could possibly kill me that quickly ????  So I put it out of my mind.  Then I had a sort of weird tugging sensation from my nipple to my armpit, it was barely anything but it was another little bell that was ringing in the back of my mind and when I went looking for a comfortable bra because my breasts were uncomfortable I finally felt 'something' with my left inner arm brushing against my left breast and I booked a private breast screen. Nobody laughed at my 'premonition', everyone took me seriously.  Perhaps because I was paying hard cash ... The radiologist said he was very concerned at what was by then a 75mm suspicious area. They biopsied it and told me I'd need an MRI also, so I'd be as well to go back into the NHS queue.  Screening is not an exact science and you are at the mercy of the technicians and radiologists.  If you are concerned get a second opinion.   I left mine 3 years and am incredibly fortunate that the cancer hadn't spread further in that time. Having said that, it might have, it's just not shown up on any scans, yet.  The routine mammogram in 2012 wasn't the only scan I had a problem with, the MRI from June 2015 was reported by my private radiologist and by the imagining team at the hospital I'd been sent to for treatment and my private guy picked up a 2nd suspicious lesion where the hospital team didn't, which resulted in the surgeon missing, what was by then, a prominent 15mm lump in my chest, it had appeared one morning whilst I was waiting for surgery.  I pointed it out to the surgeon while he was drawing on me but he still didn't cut it out, because they follow the MRI reports and it wasn't on the report.  And I knew he was going to miss it, I was frantically searching for a lipstick pencil to draw a circle around it, I still kick myself for not just taking his pen off him and drawing on myself.  So yes, mistakes happen. Don't be fobbed off because breast cancer isn't painful, my second lump was exquisitely painful.  Don't be fobbed off because of your age either.  Part of the reason I wasn't taken seriously at first was because '50' is the age for suspicious lumps to be taken seriously as breast cancer and I was only 48. Breast cancer strikes at any age, it's just more likely in the over 50s. feel free to ask any questions xx Carolyn",

Or, UCLH is linked to UCL and has a student accommodation list, likewise the other teaching hospitals. The rooms are very basic but usually comfortable and clean.  I booked myself on a 06.00 flight from Luton which required a 03.00 start, I thoroughly enjoyed the break so it was worth it, but I'm not a morning person so booked myself into student rooms in Luton about half a mile from the airport. Small but had everything I needed, kitchenette, shower, loo, smallish double bed, table and chair. I think it was about 40 quid for the night but they wanted a cleaning fee which then bumps the price up but much less stress than being an hour from the airport.  (if mistymoley is reading this, I can't do Luton Airport in under and hour, I've no idea why and i've tried several routes) My boobs haven't changed but did moisturise when I remembered, not great on manicures either, or attaching fake eyelashes. I do expect my implant / reconstructed boob to change over time, they did say that, but more down to gravity.

      "Content": "hi Pootlecav  obviously we are all on high alert for more lumps once we get that original diagnosis it is possible this is a new tumour but it's also possible that a small lesion was missed during your scanning that would have formed part of the original diagnosis if it had been identified which would mean that rather than being an instant recurrence it's simply something that was missed trust me, this is better I know it doesn't sound like it but it is I had an MRI scan as soon as I'd had my breast clinic appointment, I had a large area that looked very suspicious and they did an immediate biopsy of the area and a lymph node. At the same time they said they were sufficiently concerned to recommend an MRI which took place two weeks later. In the meantime my biopsy  'only' revealed DCIS. Because I'd paid a private radiologist for the ultrasound and biopsy he clearly felt obliged to report the MRI but so did the London team who I'd been transferred to. The private guy spotted a second highly suspicious lesion in my upper inner quad left breast but the London team deemed it unremarkable. In between diagnosis and waiting for the mastectomy this other lump popped up one morning and it was painful. The London team, having not reported it, then ignored it in the mastectomy.  If I hadn't been vigilant, and adamant, it could have stayed there for months, only coming to light if it grew more or spread and caused consistent & persistent pain and discomfort. As it was, I had everyone saying it wasn't possible that the surgeons could have missed it, so I had to be very stubborn (unlike me) and insist that I believed this to be the case and I was routed around the rapid diagnostics again. With your DCIS and WLE you are slightly more at risk  of further suspicious areas being missed, DCIS doesn't look suspicious to the surgeons, it looks like healthy tissue, something my 2nd surgeon explained to me. Don't panic but DO ask for a full review of all your imaging, to check that anything unusual wasn't missed in the run up to your surgery and therefore potentially missed. If this is the case it's not so much of an issue, it's a right royal pain in the arse, but it's not as serious as a super aggressive cancer that has built a whole new tumour in record time. Mine was Her2+ and that does have a reputation as being sneaky and aggressive but ER+ not as much. Have I managed to reassure you at all ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Yes talk to the oncologist but it's the imaging reports and scans and the surgeons who are the critical teams now. I was more relieved that they had finally take my concerns seriously, and Her2+ is always recommended chemo.  So I had 6 months of chemo and then went back to scrape away the residue of this second tumour but my further surgery was a lot easier than the first, I healed faster and the result is better. big hugs Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "hi LondonLass  could you get a doctors or consultant letter to verify you're finished treatment and are fit for work ? mine was going to give me a letter to say I was fit to have some vaccinations. Remind them of the 3 month trial period, in the nicest possible way, you then have 3 months to prove you're capable? I must admit to being a bit put off when two candidates for one job admitted to having had stress issues and had taken time off work, eventually leading to an agreement to separation, hence looking for new job. The stress can occur at any time and is unpredictable and can cause issues with the rest of the team. We had plenty of young fit and healthy applicants who were better suited and we weren't a charity set up to help afflicted people, so I didn't have any reason for feeling bad. But cancer is a bit different and once you're through treatment you need a way to move on, or even if you're on continuous treatment that keeps everything under control, I've coped with taking 1 day off per 3 weeks to get a jab and I wouldn't imagine that being a problem. It's a known quantity, you can plan around it. Of course it's tempting to say nothing. I guess the other alternative might be do a month volunteering to prove your stamina, but hopefully these interviews will get you the job. let me know if any of this is helpful ? Carolyn x",

I know we don't feel 'sick' because the breast cancer is usually detected as part of screening or self examine but chemo will make you exhausted and I don't think that's fair on you or your patients. then take a break and review what you actually want to do work wise, it may be that you decide to re-enter nursing on a training scheme that the NHS is investing in, or further specialism to carve yourself a new niche. Whatever you decide, it took me the full 6 weeks after chemo finished to feel even remotely capable of basic decision making. good luck with the treatment x Carolyn",

I embarked on the course of 4 cycles of EC and 4 cycles of accelerated T armed with the full list of side effects. One thing nobody mentioned was sore broken skin around my labia , or lady parts depending on your preference. I called my nurse who bluntly asked if I'd been sexually active. It was like nobody had ever complained or mentioned this particular side effect. So I googled it and found that it was mentioned fairly frequently on American cancer support sites leading me to deduce that we Brits are just shy about it. Anyway, I found that good old Sudocrem works a treat, I went for smoothing a layer on to  clean finger then dabbing on the affected bits. Personally I wish we were more used to bidets in the UK but washing the area and drying gently with a hair dryer can help. hope everyone is having a lovely mothering Sunday xxx",

I also had a terribly sore neck and severe chest pains at least twice. It was very strange. Then when they called to say they'd booked me an appointment in the cancer wing for my results I freaked out. I checked all the usual sites but couldn't find any way I could avoid at least a stage 3 diagnosis and feared a stage 4, there were lots of people saying slight twinge, a bit of back pain and two to five years and immediate chemo to shrink the tumour.

I did have breast cancer and I did have to have a mastectomy and chemotherapy, so I am talking from experience.  I did have a spot on my arm which alerted me that I needed to see someone to get myself checked out, everyone agreed that the spot was absolutely nothing to do with cancer but I did actually have breast cancer, so at least I got myself checked.  There's a lot they don't know about cancer. The one thing that's certain is that only a biopsy will give you a clear picture of the cells and sometimes that procedure has to be repeated ... At 36 it is unlikely it will be breast cancer but there is a small chance it might be. And no, a nurse practitioner probably won't have the skill level and expertise to recognise it, her job is to reassure and if, which I suspect it might, the patch heals over the next few weeks, she will have been right to reassure you.  Try and be patient and wait two weeks, it will seem like an eternity but, as I was told, cancer does not 'get better', it does not 'heal', it tends to get progressively worse or it just fails to heal, it persists .  I had my cancer for 3 whole years, it was missed in a routine mammogram . On the whole, two weeks won't be the life changing difference.  In two weeks, if you need to , book another appointment and , if the professionals are doing their job, they will automatically elevate you to be checked out more thoroughly.  In the UK we have a two week rule but some people do find it hard to be referred, their symptoms are just too vague, and that was me, I had a lot of very vague symptoms and nobody took me seriously and, because I'd had that mammogram , reported as 'clear' , nobody even thought to check for breast cancer. Even though, with hindsight, I'd been referred several times over the years for suspicious lumps and skin texture. I'd even had a biopsy on the exact lump 10 years earlier.  We have a few ladies who post from the US, let me see if I can tag Mirabo who may be able to give you some more helpful local experiences, and I mean more local than the UK chin up Carolyn xxx",

The one stop clinics often give you the results there and then, which is great but you need to be prepared, perhaps take a friend, it can take a couple of hours?  They sometimes want to take a sample using a biopsy technique, this involves a local anaesthetic and a small incision and they tape you up after, it can be a bit bruising but responds well to paracetamol.

      "Content": "it's tricky isn't it, I didn't tell anyone until I got my results and knew there was something to be concerned about, except my husband, he doesn't miss much. You don't want to worry people when it might be nothing to worry about. I went to all my appointments on my own, I just prefer it that way. Men are a bit useless, or the men in my life are. I took some notes, asked for explanations of the bits I didn't understand and on the whole managed to retain most of the info.  Came home and delivered the news. My eldest said, well you made it sound like it was nothing to worry about, so I didn't worry. Bless him. That's what they told me initially, it's DCIS, it's not life threatening, you just need a mastectomy. But I'd never heard of it, so it was a bit confusing. They were all smiles, but telling me I had cancer, albeit very early stage. Of course that all changed after the op.. but the original consultant had warned me that might be the case. He was very kind actually. So, I had mammogram, ultrasound and biopsies on the day, then about 2 weeks later had an MRI but in reality they knew from that first session they wanted to treat me with a mastectomy. ( I just updated my profile to reflect that) It's a lot to take in, it's all a bit of a shock and I was very sad to think about having my breast removed but the doctors were really reassuring about the cosmetic results that could be achieved, my daughter straight away called it a boob job and one of my nurses didn't like that, she kept saying it's cancer not a boob job. I just felt more comfortable thinking about it how my daughter saw it. the youngest was 13 when I was diagnosed, he's 15 now, he just said will you lose your hair n shit? Angelina Jolie made my life a LOT easier, it made telling my kids easier, they'd all heard of it via her, so I didn't need to go into any long winded explanations. It could be DCIS, it could be an infection, you won't know until they do their tests. But if it is cancer, it's very treatable, in most cases curable. How did you find a lump deep in your arm pit ?

      "Content": "Katedw32 Carolyn - I like how your kids have taken to the news, they are very matter of fact but very  resilient aren't they, it's quite a difficult age with hormones etc... But how well they've took it & carried on with life as best they  is testament to what a good job you've done bringing them up. I hope they're  very proud of having such a good mum.  I do thinks it's good that big names have made the subject easier to talk about & have made it more known but also that it shows kids it doesn't always end badly so not to jump to worse case scenario. The only thing it doesn't show is the emotional roller coaster & battle in between.  I found the lump while washing my armpit, i thought I felt the soap run over something but when I brushed my finger along the skin didn't feel anything, but when I push my fingers in , that's when I felt it, it feels like a solid hard ball hanging on something, like its in the middle off String (if you get want I mean) it's weird & scary too, I have no idea what to think, do I think it's nothing or do I prepare to hear something I don't want to. I'm glad really it's only in a few days time & I'll at least have an idea if it's benign or not X  well the radiologist seemed to think one of my lymph nodes looked very suspicious but I hadn't noticed anything, well not in my left armpit. I think that's the bit I found hardest after the events, after my surgery and after my chemo, how did I miss it ? To be fair, although my tumour was 75mm it was flat not round, the bit I could sort of feel was the edge of it protruding out the side of my left breast but my breasts have always been lumpy, dense lumpy boobs, that's me. The fact you've found it and acted is really good, even if it's nothing they'll keep an eye on you now and they're taking you seriously. My GP kept telling me it was my age and my hormones and there was nothing to worry about, so I didn't. I even had a mammogram in 2012 which was reported as 'clear'.  I was so incredibly lucky it hadn't spread outside the breast in that time, I still can't quite believe it. The second weekend I waited for my results I went shopping and got hats and scarves, expecting to be told I'd need chemo straight away. That was May 2015. In the end I didn't start chemo until August. if it is cancer it's treatable, and the treatments are getting better all the time and the surgery techniques are improving too, as are reconstruction options, I quite like my fake boob, it's a bit big but it's okay I took it to the beach over the summer and nobody stared at it. thanks for the compliment, I try, but there's plenty of things I know I could do better for them, aim higher, push them to be the best and all that, I'm a bit laid back with them I think you'll still need an MRI, so the biopsy results will only tell part of the story, but we'll keep you company as long as you need us hugs where's my panda",

Demand quick results, they can do it if it's urgent and I think you qualify now, they have messed you around and you need answers quickly. I'm not sure if they can turn them around within the course of today but I would ask. My biopsy results were in within the week but had to go via a multi disciplinary team meeting which is only held once a week and both my hospitals did it on a Friday. The report also said that lymphoma couldn't be ruled out but nobody had ever mentioned that again. I asked when discussing my chemo plan with my oncologist but she said we needed to deal with the immediate problems first. The MDTM is where they all then decide the treatment plan, if one is needed.  I think you'll still be advised to have the nodes removed for closer examination under a microscope and to be on the safe side allow them to take a couple more but not full axial clearance. Read any consents carefully. hugs Carolyn xxx",

I guess you are a special case, in that, although it's not strictly spread, they are going to treat it like it will and press the pause button. I was told I was being treated as if I was stage 3 but I didn't really tick all the stage 3 boxes, but they were assuming that I would, sooner rather than later, and opted to act. I understand that the experts don't actually have all the answers but sometimes I want them to pretend to my face that they do, I like to know or believe that they are 100% on top of things. The definition of an expert is that someone is willing to embrace uncertainty and act or modify actions accordingly, it's a bit harder for us to be on the receiving end of that though. nice to see you smiling ! I've had the 15 year old on chores today but it takes my time to set the chores up, but I'm not as tired today, even though I just discovered I could watch movies on my iphone in bed, not the smartest thing I'll ever do. sleep is good and yogurt is good for thrush isn't it ??? have a good evening, perhaps chat tomorrow Carolyn x",

I was completely paranoid about my eyes as I've had dozens of eye infections over the years but I didn't have any bother at all. I'd warned the doctors but they wouldn't prescribe in advance which I thought was pretty mean and insensitive of them. Try not to rub it, easier said than done, sorry. This isn't going to help tonight but Golden Eye Ointment is great and very soothing. Actually if you have a 24 hour chemist they might have something. Boots have a marvelous selection of eye remedies a lot of them are witch hazel based. For the old fashioned approach you could try a cooled boiled tea bag resting on closed eyelid or cucumber, cleaned. Or, as my father used to do, he'd take off his wedding ring and get me to rub it gently. Again, i'd give it a wash first. Gold is inert and therapeutic. hope that helps, I do have a lot of sympathy for you  x x x hugs Carolyn x",

      "Content": "hi Lizz Chemotherapy is dangerous and shouldn't be undertaken lightly. It causes suppression of the immune system which leaves you open to infections and there are plenty of ladies on here who can vouch for that. It also causes side effects some of which are long term and some irreversible.  Nobody in their right mind would put themselves through chemo if they didn't have to. I wish EVERYONE would STOP guilt tripping people that don't really need it to go through with it Borderline means exactly that. We have to draw a line somewhere. Our speed limits on the motorway is 70 but everyone does 75 and the police won't fine you for 75. But they might fine you for doing 80 because it's pushing the limit a bit.  I think, using Predict, which is admittedly a bit dated now, as someone pointed out the other day, if you don't achieve a 10% uplift rest easy and refuse.  I didn't want chemo but I couldn't ignore the nearly 30% improvement in my chances. My surgery only outcomes were predicted to be 50 50.  You are the exact type of case that has just been highlighted as benefitting from the new test to avoid over treating borderline cases, are you in London ?

I did feel rough, I'm not going to lie but I got through it and here I am now almost a year past chemo and I do feel like I've recovered. I have a full diary and I've taken holidays and I feel in control, almost. I hope you can help your partner and friends to understand what's going to happen when you go through chemo, on the whole you will be extremely tired, I slept a lot, and when I wasn't in bed I was sleeping on the sofa. I don't remember being awake. I had a lovely wig which made me look 'normal' but that was confusing because I didn't feel 'normal' and they just need to understand that. I'm not explaining this that well. try asking questions ? Carolyn xxxxx",

      "Content": "hi Kate I don't think I'll have my other breast done, not yet anyway. I stopped pestering the GP in the end, I gave up and booked myself a private screening but I'm not sure what I'll do next year. Hopefully I'm in a minority, I don't think anyone else has had quite as much bad luck with screening and scans? if you have implants I don't think they'll do mammograms, it would be really uncomfortable for you. For my first annual mammogram they did the right side and then ultrasound on both. The different imaging techniques show slightly different information, it was my MRI that picked up the extra tumour on the inner upper area of my left breast, it hadn't shown on either the mammogram or the ultrasound, so I realise the benefits. In your case I'd say if they don't offer an MRI I'd request one. The lymph system is one of the body's main defense systems and it does sound like you are fighting something, whether it's breast cancer or not remains to be seen, but if it's not you will still need to find out what it is. Any number of infections can cause lymph nodes to swell up. coughs, colds, flu, mumps, glandular fever, allergies My daughter had a lymph node pop up in her groin just before we went on holiday, which was pretty annoying, but we had a GP look at it and , as they always do, he said come back if it gets any worse, but we were then away for two weeks, being over 16 I couldn't go in with her and didn't get a chance to say, but if it gets worse next week what do we need ??? It could have been any number of things but I don't think we ever discovered what it actually was. It could be the same with your arm pit node but with your other health concerns I'd be doing as many investigations as I had available to make sure I didn't miss anything. I wish my GP had been more vigilant for me and had taken my concerns seriously but at the end of the day, that mammogram said 'clear', you can't keep challenging every report. I do have trust issues now, but they seem to understand that. ... hang on a minute, if you only had the implants a couple of months ago this could easily be a delayed infection that could have triggered the lymph node to swell ... Nesslay   how long did it take for your infection to become a problem ????? Carolyn xxx",

Unless you've had that cancer diagnosis I just don't think you 'get it'.  The doctors and nurses deal with it every day but not like we have to. I found out that I had had the original lump from 2012 and I wasn't operated on until 2015, so it didn't seem to become active until after the biopsy, bit like poking a sleeping lion with a sharp stick. What makes you think your cancer is aggressive ?  Did they tell you if it's ER+ or HER2+  ? hugs Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "hi Carole,  your onco may be novice at delivery of information but he may be right on the ball as far as chemo regimen are concerned there are some scholarly articles citing that the combination of drugs he's suggesting may be beneficial. It's a bit complex, I can share if you're happy with that type of article ? it's a good idea to have an idea of what you want to achieve, a plan of action, then the nurse can help you work through it Who do you want to treat you, with what and when, how long for and what's the desired outcome/s. I'm thinking pick a few from this list 1. sort out the team you want looking after you, do you prefer onco 1or 2, surgeon A or B, and your preferred BCN,  or another team completely, this may slow things down, see later point on time frames. 2. ask for a second opinion, if you're totally confused get a senior consultant to go through everything in simple terms, this is a complex topic and although we try to get a grip it's going to be a challenge. They must communicate without patronising us but inform without confusing. That's a tall order considering they are experts in a science rather than PR arena, get them to explain precisely what they are hoping to achieve with the two alternative sets of drugs, risks, benefits etc. 3. ask for a full set of notes from the multi disciplinary team meeting, I'm sure we are entitled to this 4. time frames, it sounds to me that things aren't happening as quickly as they could, ask for reassurance on this, sometimes we do have to be patient but if we sit and say nothing we can get overlooked.  The squeaky wheel gets the oil, as they say. 5. how long will the treatment last and will you be cured (does anyone feel they are actually 'cured') or remission or 'controlled' and think in terms of diabetes being controlled by insulin therapy, the way we control many chronic illnesses. or preventing further outbreaks, I'm sure there is a word for this in oncological terms, I know triple neg doesn't have the therapy drugs but perhaps that's what this article I was reading was suggesting. then the nurse can help you formulate your thoughts for a meeting with the preferred onco / surgery  team do call the nurses, they are so kind and helpful  Carolyn x",

I had some payment duplicate advice printouts dated the same day but the account definitely showed only one. Very Weird.   I'm sure the bank can find a role for you, I need someone to hold my hand half the time. Where are you being treated, if you don't mind me asking ?   make notes then we can have a chat about the meeting and what's said. I'm intrigued to know what they offer. It seems on here most get FEC or EC and 'T' but there are dozens of different drugs, some especially for recurrence. Spain. We went a few times when the kids were smaller, to the same area, and now George is 15 he wanted to go back one last time, he was never tall enough to go on the big rides at Tivoli World. I've made it hard for myself because I was trying to do it 'on the cheap' and everyone is flying at different times. Me, the husband, George and his mate fly on the 13th, my daughter and her boyfriend fly on Sunday. Then the apartments are all over the show, I was sat with a matrix yesterday making sure I'd booked enough beds for everyone but not going mad, these apartments have a bedroom and sofa bed in living room so sleep four, so we really don't need 3 apartments, but then someone on TripAdvisor had said the loungers by the pool were a bit rough around the edges and the mattresses had seen better days and I was omg this is a nightmare, so I found another hotel down the road which was fabulously reviewed and cancelled one of the apartments, it's mostly on Booking.com and Expedia so you can swap things around, but it's me that has to sit and fathom it out. I'll need a holiday by the time I get there ! chat later Carolyn x",

I started chemo in the August 2015 and was due to finish Christmas Eve and I wanted it out of the way. Sometimes chemo has to be delayed, before every infusion they check your blood and if some of the readings are too low they give you stuff to boost you up and delay a week.  So it doesn't always go to plan. Mine did and  I did have my last chemo on Christmas Eve but I wasn't up to much over Christmas. Chemo made me very tired and I slept a lot. I also didn't feel or look great. You want your mum to look fab in the wedding photos, don't you, I mean you'll be looking at them for the rest of your days and proudly showing them to your kids and grand kids.

It is just exactly the same principle but don't put sugars in, so no syrup and no granulated sugar,  honey is a naturally occurring sugar so you can have a spoonful of that but it will boost your sugar levels.  I think I probably used a recipe not too far away from my porridge one, oats and milk plus grated ginger, handful of chopped nuts and seeds, chopped apple, and maybe a mashed banana. Instead of serving it as porridge you make it less runny and dump it in a dish and bake it. I'm not a chef as you can tell. But you can bake cakes without refined sugar. peaches and cardamom ... mmmmmmmmmmmmm It's my eternal frustration that the ship carrying vanilla docked before the one carrying cardamom, vanilla makes me feel sick and dizzy.

Parcetamol is fine for pain relief but remember not to mix pills and lemon drinks like Lemsip as you'll double dose. keep an eye on your temperature and if it goes anywhere near 38 don't be brave get some medical advice my temp crept up a couple of times and initially I just took a few layers off and removed the ugg boots and bobble hat and moved away from the radiator and that did the trick but seriously do not suffer in silence, sepsis can kill pretty quickly.

I was expecting to die when I was told I had cancer and when I had surgery and when I had to have chemo, it's what I've been programmed to believe and until someone shows you there is another way, it's what you accept.

      "Content": "hi Denise feeling anxious is normal but that's not going to help you, you'll just have to find something to distract you. What about the kids ? Actually this might solve both, do they like swimming ? Do you swim? Is there a nice pool near you? I love swimming but since my op I just haven't fancied going near water, I did swim a couple of times when I was on a beach holiday in May/June but my local pool is a bit tired around the edges and although it's having a facelift I think that's more about the fitness area. Swimming has loads of benefits. I can list a few if you like. My physio was brilliant, she had magic fingers and sorted all my cording out in about 10 mins, so get your GP to refer or self refer, if that's available in your area. Lastly and I'm not sure I want to recommend this but a little Chinese girl offered me a massage on the beach for 10\u20ac and I let her pummel my right arm, I'd got a bit of a tight tendon and immediately it hurt like hell and I wondered what on earth she'd done but it's fine now. I know nothing about massage but maybe a sports massage, if you can get a recommendation. 1. get physio 2. get swimming then try the massage, but only if you have someone that comes highly recommended locally I actually find simple shoulder rolls really help, that's how my physio started me off and what's the one where you shrug your shoulders up to your ears ? repeat times 20, if seems like nothing but it really helps.

So I went about it in the only way I know how, I conducted some research using Google.  I don't know Chloecat, I've never met her, I just happened upon this thread and it struck a chord because I was shit scared of dying because everyone I knew who had had chemotherapy had died.  I don't know anyone else on this forum apart from Kacang, who I travelled to see in Canberra when I was in Australia in August and Misty Moley who lives near me.   And I met a few others in London on a meet up. I'm here because I felt I could use my less than perfect experience to help others, It's that simple.  I didn't want chemotherapy and I didn't understand why I needed it if the surgeon had removed all my cancer, but during that investigation I discovered that the surgeon hadn't surgically removed all of it.  That left me in an unusual situation because I then questioned everything. Why did the surgeon miss the obvious tumour ?  Because they were following the radiology report.  Why did the radiology report miss the lesion ? Because someone didn't pay attention ... Why do I need chemotherapy, well it's belt and braces .  Why do I need belt and braces ? and so on I had to question everything.  But once I'd started it made sense.  I knew I'd been told whilst preparing to give birth to my fourth child, yes I know I was a little late uncovering this gem but, what happens if things don't go to plan?   Ask. What happens if I do as you suggest and what happens if I don't? The experts will tell you  and the more experienced and expert they are the more honest they will be.  There are alternatives. I want you to have the best treatment and the best support but you need to understand there are other points of view.  I was told I was being given the gold standard treatment, turns out that wasn't the case.  Was I lied to ? No. I was just 1 month too late for the double dose of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.  Will it make a difference ?????????????????????????????????????????? we'll never know I had the best conventional treatment available at the hour minute and second I was prescribed treatment  will it be enough watch this space",

I spoke to quite a few people when I was trying to make up my mind about chemotherapy. But in the end it was the oncologist, Dr Marina Parton at the Marsden, who others have praised, who actually convinced me.  You do need a doctor you can have complete faith and trust in. For this you will need to be a little bit assertive and I actually struggle with this, oh yes I do !  Not so much if I'm advocating for other people, mostly when I'm standing up for myself.  How do you get on with your GP?   You can see if the choose and book system might be applicable in your case, I think it should be.  You can opt to attend the Marsden if you're London based, or reasonable travelling distance or the Christie in Manchester, but there other local centres of excellence, which we could put a call out for, which area are you ? Our local hospital has a very good oncologist who people travel to see, can't think of his name but I can Google it, that chemo brain again.  I'm with you, the chemo you're being offered is belt and braces and there is no evidence that it will or has worked for you.  End of the day they are right, it is about being able to live with your decision if you refuse. But I think if you find the right oncologist you may find a better solution for you, Marina is pro personalisation and there actually quite a few chemo drugs to choose from.  big hugs Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi chloecat45  I'm intrigued by this sodium sulphate issue obviously  we don't want too much of any salt/s in our diet, or too much of any one thing overall but I'm really struggling with finding references to this, other than in this particular link which is surprisingly similar to your list http://rosanista.users4.50megs.com/library03/1957p075.htm which is an Astrology based diet advice site I like astrology and have been known to argue the toss for it in a few debates but I'm not sure I'd advise one zodiac sign to avoid one food or another and certainly not in terms of a diet relating to cancer, when we laugh at those who proclaim we should all eat kale and be cured, and yes, I have eaten more kale and turmeric and flaxseed since I read that those things are supposed to help but ... Sodium sulphite is also known as E221, used as a preservative, which changes to sodium sulphate on exposure to oxygen. minerals occur naturally and therefore are found in traces in the food chain but I wouldn't have thought any one food attracted more and therefore you wouldn't find naturally occurring higher levels in some than others ? as for 'good' and 'bad' sources, a chemical compound is a chemical compound and if you change one molecule it becomes a different compound, rather than a 'bad' version I'd take this with a pinch of salt did you see what I did there ... when you've stopped laughing could you find a web site with an outline of the test you had  ???  I'm interested to know more. I had the Thriva test sent out in the post and that revealed a very low level of vitamin D, I'd had really bad skin since October and was struggling but a bottle of skin, hair and nail supplement from H&B seems to have worked and that appears to correlate to the results of the test.  My GP said nothing could be done.   Now I'm not going to say vitamins cure cancer but I do think we can help our bodies repair and recover to assist the healing processes.  Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "brace yourselves, it's a long one, sorry ! Conventional Treatments versus Alternatives   The NHS is never going to be 100%   It is a system that allows the population access to a healthcare program designed to treat millions of people cost effectively and as long as a better percentage have good outcomes it is considered a success. It must also treat every ailment in every patient group.    I received less than excellent care from what is widely regarded as the top hospital in the country.    I was assigned the completely traditional, cut, poison & burn approach but they messed up the diagnosis and then the standard routine went awry.    From this forum I can see plenty of women being told immediate reconstruction isn't appropriate for them.    Since I was originally diagnosed with DCIS, immediate reconstruction was deemed appropriate by the Royal Marsden in Chelsea.    I'd paid for a private screening and both the consultant and radiologist were warning me that since my suspicious area was large, 65mm, and we could see it was actually present in the 2012 mammogram, therefore had been there 3 years , I was probably likely to be one of the 20 % that get regraded/staged post mastectomy . With that in mind I should have been offered delayed reconstruction.    The team at the Marsden disregarded this information.     As it turned out I was re-staged from 0 to 3, being Her2+ and had full EC T chemo with Herceptin, via the staging scans for bone and chest, abdomen and pelvis to check how badly they had missed things.    But at the end of treatment radiotherapy was deemed to be of little benefit, partly due to potential to damage the implant ... Don't all shout at once ...   Into this mix, add that my private team spotted a second separate highly suspicious lesion from the MRI which then popped up early one morning as a clearly visible tumour, no X-ray vision required! And it was also very painful.  I pointed it out to the surgeon during the pre-op measuring and drawing session.  Post op , when the painkillers had worn off and the implant had settled down a bit, I realised the lump was still there.    So I mentioned it, as you do.   Everyone told me I was imagining it, even my sympathetic GP said it was impossible for it to be missed, he said, they'd have had to cut around it.    I had to raise a formal complaint to get attention and then was routed through the system as a new patient    I met with the senior surgeon, who is actually highly regarded, and she was so embarrassed she couldn't even find a way to apologise.    There were errors  What can I say. That if I hadn\u2019t been persistent and confident enough to challenge the well regarded surgeon that lump would still be in my chest hidden by the implant, probably spreading around my body.   I am very grateful to Chloecat because we need people who question the routine.   All change is dependent on the unreasonable woman, I read that somewhere, the reasonable person adapts themselves to the world, the unreasonable insists on adapting the world to themselves, therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable people.     Women die from breast cancer, therefore, we can deduce that the current treatments are not perfect, they are working for the majority most of the time but nearly 1000 women a month still die. Broadly the statistics seem to suggest that more than 80% survive 5 years or more, it says 86%.   https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/breast-cancer-stats-sheet-february-2015.pdf   But that\u2019s a 14% failure rate.   To improve the situation, something must change.   In the NHS change happens very slowly, my onco told me confidently that \u201cnobody uses F anymore\u201d . But here I can clearly see that actually most oncologists DO still use F , FEC T being the standard treatment.  One lady said her chap said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to drop F from his regimes.   Everyone saw the apple fall, only Newton asked why?.   Most of the problems are sorted by asking the right questions.   Why do women still die from breast cancer?   I know it isn\u2019t something any of you want to hear about but it is a question, or set of questions, that need to be asked to prevent women dying, or certainly reduce the numbers.   It is possible that the chemotherapy itself is responsible for an amount of those deaths, we know that chemotherapy carries a 10% risk of death, that\u2019s for ALL patients and ALL cancers.  For breast it is considerably less because we\u2019re an easier group to manage but we settled on 3% on another thread, so let\u2019s use that but it will vary person to person and for some the risk associated with chemotherapy will be too high, and then we need alternatives. Some of those alternatives are the things that Chloecat is suggesting \"HiFU, Laser, etc\"  But unless enough people step forward to offer to trial them, things won't change. I wasn\u2019t brave enough to defy convention but I\u2019m grateful to the people who are.   hugs to all Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi PLASTIC    a warm welcome from me too as KerryCake suggests there is a triple negative group but the main breast group is busier I don't think the treatment is much different, to be honest, I'd focus on talking to people who are facing chemotherapy generally rather than specifically. We have a monthly chemo club https://community.macmillan.org.uk/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/38/t/137017 and Crystaljuju was also triple negative. have a look at that thread and join in ? I finished chemo Christmas Eve 2015, that's a while ago and I feel fine now, the main thing I remember was feeling tired, incredibly overwhelmingly tired.  My anti sickness meds worked so I didn't really suffer nausea.  My hair fell out but it's grown back, I've just had my first hair cut but I'm not a regular at the hair dressers.  hugs Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "Lavendergirl  far from it, I appreciate any honest debate but chloecat45 has been keeping us up to date on her approach for a while and I wanted to say out loud that I do appreciate her stance. I accepted the evidence based treatment route and it failed me. it's my story I'm not proud of how it happened, in fact I'm always slightly embarrassed to say that I chose to be treated at the Marsden and it fell far below expectations.  What I want you to accept is that without people like Chloecat , and all the others who have contributed on this thread,  there can be no change and change is needed for there to be advancements in therapies.  None of the doctors or consultants I spoke to wanted me to have to endure chemotherapy. They all apologised profusely.  Everyone wants to cure cancer without inflicting worse pain and suffering. For that to happen, someone has to be brave enough to refuse conventional treatments and give it a go with an alternative.  I wasn't even brave enough to try an alternative pain killer !!! hugs Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa 16 years is a long time, may I ask how old you are? and what treatment you had last time? I'm fine today apart from clients giving me the runaround. I had my last Herceptin jab 4 weeks ago so am waiting to see what happens, I have my last clinic appointment of the year next Friday and have a list of things to ask, odd aches and pains, stuff that I'm sure they'll dismiss.  Trouble is I had several items missed on scans and initially my 75mm tumour didn't present as a lump, more a flat area. My symptoms weren't specific to breast cancer, more a general overall unwellness. They say that no spread or recurrence is symptom free but I've heard of several cases recently that had no symptoms. Trouble is if I have a Her2 recurrence I guess there'll be no choice again, everyone has chemo for Her2+++ ... even though , for me, it's either a yes or no.  What I mean is, I went through 6 months of chemo but I know there is still a significant risk of recurrence and spread, and since I don't really understand statistics completely, for me it's either yes or no, which is 50 -50.  I actually don't feel any more confident having had chemo than I would have if I hadn't. I worry, but I would have worried anyway, would I have worried more or less ? If it comes back I'll still wrestle with my conscience about whether I could have done more to prevent it. make sense ? I suggested this to someone else, try saying to your oncologist that you've decided against it and see what their reaction is. Our faces tell the truth for a split second. hugs Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi Amanda someone said to me that I needed to roll with the punches  I had to look it up right now your body is 'ill' and unable to cope, as was mine,  but after surgery my body felt a lot better I endured 6 months of chemo, 4 x EC and 4 x T and the 18 Herceptin  jabs all without incident, I pretty much sailed through it BUT I know how I felt and I did not feel well and after the surgery I definitely felt better.  It's a longer story but for now I think you need to 'roll with the punches' but stay vigilant to what's offered, I can see you have taken note of the dosage.  The variables are; the type of chemo offered, FEC, EC, several types of Taxane, some platinum based chemo's which aren't always offered as a first line but can be and then the dosage and then the frequency ALL of which can make a massive difference but it does take time and patience to see what will work for you. Taxanes can be offered weekly or fortnightly and I think they're even offering a much lowered daily dose now. Mine was accelerated T and that was every two weeks. I was told it was tailored to me but when pressed my onco admitted I was a standard patient and therefore it was the standard treatment. She treated me as if I was stage 3 even though my staging was not exact and she downgraded me for an insurance policy recently, to 2B or 2C, there's some flexibility .  Let's say, for the sake of argument, you agree to an 8 week plan to go for surgery and the CT scans and results, and fingers crossed the lesions in the liver are innocent, and you're still undecided on what is the best course of action, you need to be proactive.  1. What happens if I do as you tell me to do? 2. What happens if I do nothing? 3. What other treatments and investigative procedures are available ? 4. is there anything else we ought to be looking at? and keep repeating this list at each and every appointment  you sound like you're prepared for a debate or two .

I need a skin specialist.  The last lady said to look out for micro dots around the mole and if that happened go straight to GP for removal and analysis. hugs Carolyn xxx",

I was mortified. Now I can look back and laugh but it was a huge thing to deal with at the time.  I wanted to rush back to him and recount every single conversation that I'd had with every other doctor to prove that I wasn't more concerned with my appearance than with my health. Sorry you're having to postpone your trip but it will be something to look forward to when your mood dips, which it will from time to time. Did you see a dentist ? I keep harping on about dental hygiene but it is important, the mouth is the point most things enter our body, the gums are a direct route into the blood stream and sepsis kills quicker than cancer does. As for the wig, try also hot hair and hair raisers based in West London. I didn't think I'd wear a wig but the 2nd one I got made me look so normal I wore it most days when I was going out. http://www.hothair.co.uk/home.php keep us posted x x",

I reacted badly to the biopsy I had and in the 6 weeks I was waiting for my mastectomy I couldn't eat much, I wanted to but just couldn't finish anything, it was quite wasteful. Then I went to get my teeth checked and scrubbed . . . Soap box moment ... Once the chemo started my appetite was fine although I think I was quite lucky. I asked for a print out of my bloods each time and it was quite interesting looking at all the trace elements gradually vanishing. My advice is eat a variety of foods, not large amounts just a decent amount of things to put back all the essential nutrients, you don't need much zinc but you can't live without it, and when my potassium levels dropped I discovered that can be linked to mood swings, all fascinating stuff. I try and walk most days and that really helped, there were a couple of days each time that I couldn't get off the sofa but when o did I felt so much better.  several times I caught myself living on toast but once I was cheerful enough I'd get myself down to M&S for their ready prep' melon and veg salad things they do. I did put on a bit of weight which I'm still trying to shift but nothing too drastic, I still fit in my clothes . Carolyn X",

I also had some fat necrosis which the surgeon squeezed. For all this fiddling about she gave me a course of heavy duty / industrial strength antibiotics. You will need to get this checked out as it's technically an open wound which will invite infection. Do you have an out of hours GP service, if not I think you are going to have to call up your local A&E and get some advice, they offered to take me to a side room rather than in the general area although in the end I didn't need to go in, my temp dropped and everything settled down. \u2022 Did you get given antibiotics when they drained the fluid ? \u2022 Have you checked your temp ? \u2022 when you say burst, is it the scar that's broken open? The seroma will eventually settle down but you need to act fast to prevent an infection settling in. Macmillan lines aren't open over the weekend but you can call 111 for advice or , if you're feeling up to it, visit a Boots pharmacist. But I really think they will say antibiotics. hugs Carolyn x Make sense ? Kacang ?",

Funny thing was a nurse got the lefts and rights mixed up and I thought it was affecting the right breast too.  It took more than a week to accept I was going to have to have the left mastectomy but less than 30 seconds to decide the right needed to go.

If you are in any job where you are fortunate enough to get automatically signed off sick I would say go straight to your manager or HR department and explain the situation, possibly with any letters or reports that you have. If you are one of the thousands on zero hours contracts you may wish to keep quiet for a little longer to see what the treatment plan is.

We feel guilty enough as it is.  We don't need the extra guilt of turning down what might be a life saving treatment. But chemotherapy is dangerous and carries significant risks of long term side effects, and we simply don't know whose cancer will respond and whose won't. We also have no idea who will react badly or who will be affected more seriously by the side effects. Are there other factors affecting the decision?  did you have just the one lump? in my humble opinion if it's more than one affected area I probably would go for chemo. Carolyn xx",

I have an ongoing issue with my thumbnails, both of them, in the same place, splitting down the middle, that looks like it could be a genetic flaw, but there's another place on my third finger right hand that just chips off but that's the result of some injury, so not a genetic flaw.

      "Content": "what happens to us when we turn 50 ????? I know BC isn't limited to 50 year old women but it does seem rather a coincidence that so many of us fall victim around this age. I'm 54 now but was 48 in 2010 when all this started. I pestered my GP, in fact I couldn't have annoyed them more if I'd tried. But the symptoms weren't that specific, I didn't have a classic lump, just lumpy and since the boobs had always been lumpy nothing had changed. Then the 2012 screening came back 'clear'. It didn't occur to me to question it, but I should have. I'm an advocate of immediate reporting now. Like how our echocardiograms are done. I said to the nice young man who has seen me twice now, if I walked in slightly out of breath, not too cheerful and you scanned me and found nothing wrong, you'd look a little harder because you've seen me as a person, and I look like I'm suffering a bit. Whereas I just walked in here upright and breathing normally, I joked with you about your tan, you can see I'm fit and healthy, you'd be really surprised to see something amiss with my heart. When I went for my 2012 screening the technician pursed her lips and although she didn't say it out loud, she was thinking, this ones going to get a recall. If she'd reported the scans she'd have double checked, because she was expecting to find something wrong. When we looked in May last year it was clearly there, no question, somehow nobody looked at it. But screening isn't perfect. IF it catches one or two people it's a success. The MRI revealed the more sinister lump which hadn't even presented itself at that stage. Even then the NHS team managed to miss it, I need to address that, there is clearly a shortcoming in that department which needs attention. It may have been resolved now. I hope your breasts are recovering, you sound like they turned you into a bit of a pin cushion !  Did you say you were having reconstruction or are they waiting in case you need radiotherapy ? did they say what type of breast cancer ? ER or PR which is hormone receptor positive, Her2 positive, that's a growth hormone gone bonkers, or triple negative ? FEC T is the standard treatment for invasive breast cancer.  I didn't have the 'F' part, my onco said \"nobody uses F anymore\".

      "Content": "RIGHT this is what my GP told me so , it's cancer, breast cancer is treatable you'll feel rubbish for 6 months but you'll get over it, 90% of women diagnosed survive breast cancer to 10 years, it's one of the most treatable and curable cancers. Stats only go to 10 years, sorry. CURABLE, yes, that's right, curable. most women are cured. Even if they tell you it's a large area of DCIS in the results meeting, there's every chance you will find that there is invasive cells lurking in that large area, that's what happened to me. Large areas of DCIS are treated with mastectomy, with or without reconstruction. Then you have to wait until the lab sends the results.   Here is an idiots guide to breast cancer, with credits more waiting and more thumb twiddling, I didn't involve my family in this bit, just breezed through with a cheery \"it's all fine\" I had to have staging scans before chemo and that is a stressful situation. You will try and weigh up how good you've been in life and how many people you were mean to.  It's a guilt thing.  Let's do the grieving process again, shock, denial, sadness, despair (I always forget that one) blaming, bargaining, resolution and acceptance.  Is that right ?  I always seem to get it wrong but it's not linear, it goes round and round and round and up and down, hence the roller coaster analogy.   More  \"it's all fine\" Then chemo, and it's clearly not fine any more.  The hair is the big deal. And you are absolutely cream crackered. I slept, a lot. But, you're not going to die.  Not yet anyway.  I have an ongoing joke with my daughter, she says in mock horror, are you going to die, and I cheerfully say, not yet. And I don't intend to die just yet. There's plenty of treatments left, I only just completed the first round. My cousin said after her 10mm tumour was removed, a very good friend who is a surgeon said I'd be fine, and I believed him. For her it's that simple. Likewise for my son, I said it was okay and he believed me. Jojo, you're going to be fine and Worried, you are going to be fine too. but there is a bit of feeling a bit shite to get through first, next summer we'll be celebrating hugs xxx",

My GP said it's your age and hormones.  In early 2015 I had a premonition I wouldn't see Christmas so I booked myself another private screening and there is was.  65mm . It wasn't a lump more of a suspicious looking flat affected area.  The team then said I'd need an MRI and since it wasn't worth paying they fed me back into the NHS but the private guy reported the MRI because I'd paid him. The Marsden also reported the MRI as they were taking over my treatment.  Private guy picked up a 2nd lesion but the Marsden missed it and whilst I was waiting for surgery it actually popped up as a lump, it was painful and obvious, no need for x-rays to see it. I called the unit and insisted the BCN makes notes but we agreed that since i was already booked for a mastectomy nothing was really going to change.  I pointed it out to the surgeon on the morning of the surgery but he followed the erroneous MRI report and concentrated on removing the large area of DCIS in the upper outer quadrant and avoided the upper inner altogether  and missed the tumour completely Thankfully I spotted the mistake but I had to make a formal complaint because nobody believed me. Although I have just had my third set of annual scans reported as clear I'm never sure I can trust them. Carolyn xxxx",

      "Content": "hi sazmoz  welcome to the online community typically you will be called into the breast screening programme on a two week referral but that can vary if your area is a bit busy, then it really does depend on what they see at each step. The one stop breast clinics that are fairly common now can do mammograms, ultrasounds and biopsies in one session of about 3 hours, obviously if they don't see anything suspicious on the mammogram or ultrasound they don't do the biopsies but if they see even the smallest lump they will biopsy it. They may also biopsy a lymph node in the arm pit too. The results of that biopsy take about a week to 10 days but can take longer and if they are concerned they will book you for an MRI or other scans which also take about 2 weeks to arrange and another two weeks for results. A good clinic in a not too busy phase can turn you round from initial test to proper thorough diagnosis in about 3 weeks but if they are unsure at each step it can take 6 weeks or longer. For me I requested a scan in March but didn't get an appointment until May 8th 2015, I had my biopsy results by 19th and first surgery consultation by 1st June. I had a few lumps biopsied over the years, before my actual diagnosis, so they might decide it's nothing to worry about at the moment. How old are you ?  I found everyone's attitude shifted the moment I turned 50. hugs Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi Dragonfly46 There does appear to be some conflicting information here, doesn't there Have they told you that you are curable or incurable but treatable ????? I have a feeling that technically the incurable diagnosis comes when the breast cancer has spread outside the breast and in this instance I'm not sure it actually has, if they can operate and remove the skin, I had a skin sparing mastectomy, then the cancer will be removed and I'm not sure I'd have even waited to see if I could achieve any shrinkage, if I'm honest.  If you're trying to preserve the breast then attempt to shrink the tumour but if you're going to remove it anyway, why wait ? IF however they consider you to be a secondary or advanced or metastatic case why operate at all?  I know some hospitals or surgeons won't operate in cases like this but I'm not a surgeon or doctor so I don't really know all the ins and outs and why's. If you're still aiming for a cure then time is going to be important and the sooner you get the surgeon to operate the better, I'd have thought.  I'm thinking PALs will be your best bet.  Which hospital are you under? The PALs team should be signed around the hospital or you can call or email.  Write down your concerns and questions and request a review.  when you say in the chest wall is it still the breast tissue, not the bone or cartilage ? Could you ask your GP to help you find out via the reports what they are currently aiming for?  My GP was actually pretty helpful in a couple of situations for me.  The purpose of the multidisciplinary team is that they all agree on the best course of action for you and that doesn't sound like it's happening. Ask PALs for the multidisciplinary team report as it stands currently and also a review of your situation in light of the possible slight difference of opinion and once you have those two sit down with your GP or come back here and we can see if we can help how does that sound ? hugs Carolyn xxxx ",

      "Content": "hi Dragonfly46 I can see why you might be reluctant to engage with PALs, my brother said never complain about the food in a restaurant until after you've finished eating but sometimes that's unavoidable  In my experience I got much better treatment after I got PALs involved but they were very focused on what I would consider a successful outcome, at that point, for me, staying alive was pretty much the focus, a surgeon had missed a clearly visible tumour and I wanted it removing. The surgeon left the hospital, I don't know whether he was pushed or just moved on. These are professional people who do focus on making sure that if something isn't quite right it is put right ASAP.  I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement in care, even if they were cursing me in the staff room.  I got a better surgeon to perform the revision surgery and as much time with my oncologist as I needed and , as you can imagine , I was incredibly nervous at that point, with horror stories of wrong drugs and wrong dosages playing on my mind.  I also got fast tracked for counselling sessions.  I eventually got an apology and a promise that the imaging team would tighten up reporting, although I've never gone back to check any of that was implemented.  Could you simply ask each of the two consultants to review you again in the MDT meeting and give you a concise update ? You are allowed to be worried and you are allowed to ask for explanations to allay your fears. We're not experts, this is all new to us and I think they forget that, and some patients just aren't interested in the why's and wherefores they just want to get their treatment done and get on with their lives, it's a fine line to tread when sharing information, especially when they are time pressed.  And they see hundreds of patients each week and I know they don't necessarily read up on your notes each and every time. It is a stressful time and hard to stay on top of everything that's happening and you can legitimately ask for clarification, as I did on more than one occasion. I found that although I was prepared to be a patient patient I was often kept waiting for hours on end for a jab that took literally 3 minutes. Sitting somewhere where I was visible in the waiting room and making eye contact each time they called someone in really helped speed it up.  If the current regime isn't shrinking it I'd have thought switching to a different set of drugs or even a different brand should happen perhaps a bit quicker and it won't hurt to just ask that question.  I had to keep on top of my treatment but I really do think, or rather I really do hope, that I was an exception ! more hugs Carolyn xxx",

I can't think of the polite version of this phrase ... So I just carried on as best I could, trying not to let the family see how sad and upset I was, asked as many questions as I could think of and researched practical stuff like finding myself a good surgeon. Post mastectomy pathology showed grade 3 Her2+++ IDC and I don't remember feeling anything other than slightly frustrated that I hadn't prepared myself for that news, I knew it was a possibility but I hadn't properly adjusted myself mentally, or physically, and of course they were no longer all smiles, now they were nodding sagely saying that chemo was essential. That was a bit awkward , to be fair, having them all so happy I'd avoided chemo, then to have to back track and tell me I did have to have it. I had heard about the various steps to grief and then went and found an article on grieving, Kubler -Ross outlined this quite a few years ago and she seems to have been the first but it is about dying rather than other types,  it sort of made sense, certainly after my initial mastectomy diagnosis & treatment plan, I really was grieving for my lost boobs, until I realised they were trying to kill me. what you just listed are definitely the first stages of that grieving process http://www.ekrfoundation.org/five-stages-of-grief/ it might help to read it but it might also help if you lock yourself in a soundproof room and have a good cry I wanted to run away Carolyn x",

The government has stated that annual screening would benefit so few it's not worth it.  I can't tell you how unhappy I was when I read that. I think there needs to be a flag solution for people like me who had been checked many times by many doctors and radiologists because I showed potential symptoms that, for me, annual screening would have been worth it. thankfully, despite the 3 years, the cancer hadn't spread outside my left breast, a fact I'm still struggling with, it seems such unbelievable good luck in such a bad luck situation.

Initially the team were really reassuring, which is what you want went venturing into the unknown but afterwards did admit that while it can be very useful it can be a bit 'hit and miss'.

During a mammogram your breast is squeezed, during ultrasound you're usually flat on your back and during an MRI you're face down. Some measurements are in a 3D space and some 2 dimensional. All my imaging reports varied slightly, which isn't an issue if you're having a mastectomy but if you're trying to target a specific lump during surgery then it becomes more critical. keep asking the questions and don't forget you can call the nurses for a chat about this sort of stuff.

I just checked out 'googling' 'surgeons at Guys and St Thomas' and their site is good for a bit of background work click for link we were chatting about this yesterday, how to select a surgeon. As a challenge I will see if the formula works, in theory you read up the NHS site background, training and specialisms then you double check their private practice and reassure yourself.  I'm squeamish so opted for the basic implant, although the idea of a tummy tuck at the same time was tempting.  On the whole, the more complex the procedure the more risk it carries. The Marsden makes you scrub with Hibiscrub before going anywhere near their theatres and since it's not a general hospital their infection rates are very low. That would be on my list of questions.  Hopefully someone will have been treated at Guys and St Thomas' and have some experiences for you Carolyn x",

She said \"I'm sorry\" I muttered under my breath  \" you will be\" she then called me back to tell me she'd managed to rearrange the appointment for out patients a day earlier  ... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry In the end they told me it was DCIS, which is the least severe of all breast cancer, it needs to be watched but it's not 'life threatening'. They told me it was 'only' DCIS and I'd 'only' need a mastectomy and it wasn't urgent.   It's all fine and dandy for them to say that, isn't it .  Now, four years down the line, I can see their point of view but not that week. I wanted to seriously hurt someone for being so disorganised and flippant.  Having said all that, how do you break the bad news that it might be breast cancer?  I didn't appreciate Angelina Jolie going public with her double mastectomy but it really did help me break the news to my kids.  I just googled him and he does sound very well trained, if your mother does require treatment it looks like she's in good hands Carolyn xxxxx",

So that puts you in a good position. If my 12mm suspicious area had actually been picked up in 2012 it would have been treated with a lumpectomy and possibly radiotherapy but since it wasn't... up until I noticed a lump had changed in early 2015 By which time it had happily grown into a 75mm suspicious area, it only actually showed as DCIS on biopsy but everyone was reluctant to believe that , and rightly so , as after the mastectomy the pathology report showed multiple areas of invasive disease, of the nasty aggressive Her2 +++ variety. Thankfully it hadn't spread to my lymph nodes or further but that is something I'm still struggling with, especially since it was all missed back in 2012. I also had to wait 7 weeks for surgery from the biopsy date,  and 3 weeks for results. The first weekend I wasn't worried at all but then they called to say they'd made an appointment in the local cancer centre to give me my results , I went nuts, I googled everything and although I stuck to Macmillan , Cancer Research and other trusted sites I couldn't see a way out, the best I got was I'd a 50 50 chance IF it was still stage 3 but there was a distinct possibility it had spread to stage 4 AND I'd had a persistent cough for some months,  I felt I was doomed.  I could see that they might recommend chemo first and surgery after so I went out and got myself a hat and some scarves. I didn't use the scarves in the end I found a wig I liked. You could be unlucky and find that some cancer has sneaked out, BUT I think this is pretty unlikely ... even if you DO find you need further treatment don't panic, we're here.",

      "Content": "hi Dawson26 frankly I'd have rather gone to all my appointments alone but I know some people like company The thing is there are so many different types of breast cancer and they even call you in to tell you it's not, it really does depend what it is. It could be something other than breast cancer that they need to keep an eye on or it could be, like me, DCIS.  DCIS is incredibly common, I only found out my cousin had it after I'd emailed her to tell her my news.  She sounded incredibly calm about it all, her surgeon sounded amazing, very kind and very reassuring and I have a feeling this Mr Massannat might be super nice. Some surgeons are not great at hand holding. The more sinister and more aggressive cancers tend to affect the younger women although that's not always the case, but generally speaking as we age our cell divisions slow down and things don't tend to be as troublesome. Ageing isn't fun what with knee joints and failing eyesight and I'd have more than settled for a few hot flushes rather than chemo, but I got through it.  I think yes, they would call her in if it was urgent, as it turned out I had had DCIS for 3 years before it was reported, it was missed in the previous mammogram . Then there's a whole array of early stage 1 breast cancers, there's also grading from 1-3.  She'll need to make notes or arrange for the report to be sent to her so you can help her get a grip on it, I had my reports send to both myself and my GP and the GP was actually pretty useful to chat through it.  Breast cancer is bad news, as is any cancer, there's no getting away from it, and the cancer ads don't help, playing on people's fears to extract cash.  I like the BUPA ad, reclaiming the dance floor, that's my favourite.  But, as my GP told me, I am a large ship, with a very small hole and all my pumps are still working. I'm not sinking yet. Breast cancer treatments have progressed rapidly and the statistics are really pretty good for most of us, something like 95% are cured.  I also have a link under my signature about women who have survived as that was a big epiphany for me, I was on the tube in London and a lady was asking me where I was going, and I said to the Marsden and that's the cancer hospital so she said, breast cancer? and I said, yes, and she looked into the middle distance and said  \"I had that once\" it was the proof I needed that some women get through it and really do put it behind them. more hugs Carolyn xxx",

The private consultant was very good at this point as although it was very good news he did warn me that I had a large affected area and they only took 3 tiny samples there was every chance the news might worsen after surgery and it did.  They found enough areas of invasive breast cancer to justify offering chemotherapy and it was Her2+ so they emphatically recommended I have it.  I had EC and T from August 2015 to Christmas Eve.  The other myth the medical professionals cling to is that breast cancer doesn't hurt, I can tell you that mine did.  But I'm still here  yay !!

I had very mixed meetings with consultants and one of top surgeons in the country behaved quite oddly and very dismissively.  The biggest issue seemed to be aesthetics, everyone was very reassuring initially, telling that reconstruction is very good these days and I'd not be left feeling unfeminine but if I bought up that subject I was immediately lectured on how removing the cancer was their top priority, leaving me feeling like a vanity case, but I was only really repeating out loud what i'd been told. You're not going mad, don't panic, they all have off days and they aren't all coached in patient empathy or perhaps they just give their empathy a day off ... hugs Carolyn xxx",

More worrying is if you might be having to deal with a bit of a crank in the man who has theories about implants. Fanatics are sometimes harder to deal with.

I only had the sentinel node taken, so I was assuming less risk . but I know when I mentioned that in the MDU the nurses still weren't interested in using the veins on that side, when we were struggling for veins before the wonderful PICC line, from which I would deduce that, to the nurses, the risk is the same whether you have one or many nodes taken ? who will know http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/lymph_node_removal/lymphedema This article seems to suggest that the risk is lower when less nodes are taken but that lymphedema can occur at any time after surgery, even years later, so probably best to avoid.

      "Content": "hi Nicky first go was way too big, it didn't fit in any of my bras and my scar was a bit 'dog eared' or was it 'dog tag' I can't remember, someone will correct me, it's where the end of the scar is left poking out a bit, seamstresses will be saying that this is wholly avoidable and the surgeons need basic sewing lessons, and my 2nd surgeon made a better job, he put a smaller implant in as well. So now I'm pretty happy, I've been to the beach a few times in a bikini and wasn't self conscious at all. it's still bigger than my other one, which they've offered to 'fix' by putting an implant in the right hand side but I'm alright for now, probably in a few months, maybe, but you can't see under clothes, in fact they look pretty even when I'm dressed. The other thing I think the 2nd surgeon fixed was that the stitching holding the matrix in was a bit sore and puckered, it certainly doesn't hurt and the 'dip' they said was easy to fix has gone, so he must have done it. Hindsight moment !  I remember thinking it was so awful when I first looked at it but then had to go through chemo before anything could be put right and actually by the time I was about to have the revision surgery the whole breast and implant had settled down. So be prepared to be patient. I had a large amount of seroma too which made it look like an over inflated water filled balloon, that does settle down eventually. After the revision in March I healed quickly with no further problems at all. I'm not sure what to do about the nipple yet, I had Paget's so just as well I opted to sacrifice it. I'm giving the implant a bit of a squeeze now so I can tell you how it feels but actually I don't notice it most of the time. That Bra Foundation site is good isn't it. Carolyn x",

Cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer there now say it out loud with your mothers age and tumour size the data suggests that 90 % of women are completely cured, yes ... CURED the cancer adverts are misleading, we think when we hear the word cancer it's a death sentence, it's not it can be but that's usually things aren't picked up early, 19mm is a pretty small tumour, mine was 75mm and I had another that was 15mm, but mine was missed in 2012 so it had a while to grow unchecked but it was removed last year and I had 6 months of chemo and now I'm cancer free. I worry about stuff, aches and pains and worry that it will come back but mostly I just get on with thing, I post on here because the people on here are helpful and it was great to find people that knew what I was going through.

I haven't had an LD recon I have a simple implant, I'm a bit squeamish but one of the surgeons I spoke to was an expert in that and highly recommended it and another said it was beginning to be less fashionable and/or not so many surgeons were specialising because of the potential for nerve damage, I wonder if this is what you're experiencing ? I'm going to have to say go back to the surgeon, and perhaps get him/her to sign off appropriate physiotherapy. Dreamthief  or mistymoley  might know someone on here that has had LD recon. I'm sure after 5 weeks you ought to be lessening your reliance on heavy duty pain relief though. Carolyn x",

      "Content": "hi PurpleJan welcome to the community tricky isn't it Most surgeons are reluctant to remove healthy breasts and I can see why. What I didn't understand so well was the offer to 'even me up' with surgery to my healthy right side, which they seem happy to do. I requested several ultrasound examinations of my healthy right breast and they seem more than happy to oblige and I do find it reassuring. Especially as the radiologists don't mind chatting to you whilst they are looking and reporting as they go. We had a bit of a mix up over lefts and rights and it caused a bit of confusion, I had a 2nd tumour in the right side of my left breast but a nurse told me it was in my right breast, so we had a bit of a chat about an elective mastectomy to the healthy side, which baffled me because obviously I wasn't electing, I was acting on information given. The upshot was that we'd deal with things one step at a time. At the moment I'm cancer free but having just had my last Herceptin jab I need to check with the team to see what happens next.  I have my final review of the year in mid December and I know I need an echocardiogram. After that I think I'll just make sure I get regular checks, I'm not unhappy with my right breast v the perky new left one, in clothes it doesn't show, nor in a bikini on the beach. The more time goes by the easier it gets to just accept what will be.  I'd rather cancer came back in my right breast than somewhere else in my body but I realise I don't get that much choice. My surgeon said he's happy to discuss it with me when I'm ready and for now it's not bothering me. Mind you I had a wicked chest infection which I deduced was lung mets, so the breast is relatively harmless. Don't rush into anything is my best reasoning, surgery carries risks and there's plenty of people on here will tell you how awful post surgery infections are. Carolyn xxx",

Like you I looked to see if I could find anyone who might give me some other explanation but nobody could, Macmillan just said \"at least you've had the good sense to get it checked and that increases your odds of being in the better half of the 50 - 50\". I genuinely thought I was doomed.  I think that's why I stick around.  There are other explanations for lumps and wonkiness. Okay in the end I did have some small areas of invasive disease within the huge area of DCIS but it could have been a lot worse, given the length of time it was left. My GP said I was like a large ship with a small hole and I wasn't going to be sinking any time soon. Despite the 'large' I did find it reassuring We have to be vigilant, it's our bodies, our health, we are just numbers to the health service. Anyway, even if it is cancer they'll sort it out. The team were so cheerful when they told me I 'only' had DCIS, that was very weird, of course I realise now why they were so happy.

      "Content": "hi alli1970  welcome to the online community I had a mastectomy with immediate implant recon July 2015, had lots of seroma, scar wouldn't heal, lots of antibiotics, the scar was also untidy and had 'dog ears'. The implant was also way too big.  I needed a bit more surgery for a 2nd tumour so I asked for the implant to be swapped for a smaller one and the scar to be tidied up. 2nd op was much better, healed within a week, very little seroma, implant more suitable size, scar a lot nicer, not so scary when I catch sight of it in the mirror. I've been to the beach in bikinis several times and am really happy with the results. However I did used to swim and dive to a reasonable level and still like to have a go, I'm 54 but my son thinks I still dive pretty well, the implant caused quite a lot of drag and I did wonder how I would have coped without recon.  Obviously I'm not getting any younger and won't be going back to competitive diving but it was the first time I'd even thought about it. I thought about it the other day too but I remembered my surgeon saying he didn't want to go smaller as he was planning to 'even me up' at some point and he felt he could do a better job with the one he's used. A friend had just had a mastectomy with no recon and her scar was very neat and tidy but she was unhappy that she hadn't been offered, she's now having an expander and then implant. In my case, I felt I was being railroaded a bit, I know things do seem to happen very fast when you're diagnosed but nobody asked me if I wanted recon, everyone assumed I did, it was one of the first things my GP said to me, they do marvelous reconstructions these days. Don't laugh but I actually 'Photoshop'd' my left breast off to see what it would look like ... I even gave myself a smiley scar. I'm not sure how I'd cope with a fake one tucked into a bra, I'd probably lose it. Bottom line is the surgeons do seem to like making us happy with our appearance and should happily undertake either a removal or a smaller implant. am I helping ? hugs Carolyn xx",

I have a feeling it's quite a lengthy recovery compared to the implant but it is completely down to the individual. I haven't looked it up but from memory, two to three days in hospital, as opposed to one with an implant or day surgery for my replacement implant, I went for a smaller size to balance me up, and a week or so of gentle shoulder and arm exercises to regain movement, I drove the day after my last surgery but I wouldn't advise that, compared to several weeks of very gentle exercises to get you back moving again. I'm going to summarize as days and weeks for implant and weeks and months for autologous options. https://www.bmihealthcare.co.uk/treatments/plastic-surgery/breast-reconstruction-with-latissimus-dorsi-flap hope that helps",

      "Content": "hi Sally I wasn't really given a choice, which is just as well, I am terrible at making up my mind. The hospital where I was originally diagnosed had very few options but were happy to refer to wherever I preferred. I opted for the Royal Marsden in Chelsea and their preference is for immediate reconstruction. Although my initial diagnosis was DCIS it was a large area and had been lingering for a while so I chose implant reconstruction with the possibility to review that at a later date. It's the least invasive option, quickest and simplest of the procedures etc. There were a couple of things I wasn't happy with but overall I would recommend it. Pros -  it's quick and gets it out of the way and you don't have a phase where you have no breast which is an obvious reminder that you've had a mastectomy. Cons -  it is still a major operation and it takes time to recover. I think that because everyone was saying it's quick and simple and I was only staying in overnight I'd be right as rain in a few days and of course I wasn't. That's about managing my expectations as much as anything. The first implant was also too large but that's been replaced and now it's fine. I had to have revision surgery as there was some residual tumour that needed to be removed, although it was successfully treated with chemo and I asked for a smaller implant at that surgery. The 2nd surgery settled down a lot quicker, I had much less seroma and I healed a lot quicker. Overall I think I would recommend immediate recon.  The negatives I experienced was mostly down to my own expectations. Does that help ?   Feel free to ask for more information, I don't mind sharing and I know it all seems like you're being rushed into things, everything happens so quickly. xx Carolyn",

      "Content": "hi all I have no history of breast cancer on my mothers side but just found out my paternal cousin had breast cancer, mid 60's, but was detected earlier enough for a lumpectomy. Had I known this I may have double checked my 'clear' 2012 screening, that is when we now know the tumour was detectable, as we compared the 2012 with the 2015. IF this had been acknowledged I would have been screened annually and would have been treated in 2013. Of course, ALL cancers are actually genetic. Cancers are caused by a genetic fault. The only difference is whether or not they have managed to find clusters of faults they can identify and refer to collectively. I guess we all still just have to be vigilant with our own health and well being. Trouble is when I started to feel that something wasn't quite right I didn't really know where to start, I booked myself all the routine tests which all came back negative, but , as it turned out, the BC was a false negative. I also booked a private ear, nose and throat screening, the doctor was utterly adamant there was nothing wrong. Hindsight is fabulous but I couldn't honestly say I felt I had cancer or more specifically breast cancer.  I just didn't feel quite right.   The only thing we can do if we are aware of any family history is push for more tests or more checking of test results. ? I have told my daughter to check herself and to watch the videos on how to check herself thoroughly. BUT I have also told my sons that any daughters they may have will need to be vigilant too. x x x",

Once you get into the swing of appointments you can chat with your mum about what's happening.  You sound like you might be a similar age to my daughter, she's 23. Initially she was upset and scared but now we chat about things quite a bit. Do you have brothers and sisters too ? I found that if I told the boys not to panic they didn't. hugs Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "15 years, how annoying I'm plodding my way to the magical five at the moment but struggling to see past that.  Did you have chemo last time?  As I understand it a lot will depend on how they stage it. A recurrence in the axilla isn't necessarily classed as 'stage 4' from all I've read over the last four years, so it is a watching and waiting game for now, along with all the anxiety that brings. If it is still classed as a primary site, lymph node spread is allowed in that criteria, then they may offer the full on chemo regime , again, if you did have it the first time. This will still be with the intent to cure you.  If it is deemed to have spread outside the lymph system in close proximity to the breast they may decide to offer you chemo to keep it under control, which will be a long term plan, this will also depend on whether it's Her2+++ or ER+ or TNBC.  There's quite a lot of variables involved.  It's also up to you, to a certain extent, which options you choose to accept. Which will depend on your age and circumstances.  If I get a local recurrence or another primary in the other breast, at 56 I'm probably going to accept another six months of chemo, with the hope I'd get 10 - 15 years, that'd be quite nice and with that to look forward to, it'd make the chemo more bearable.  Have you considered what you want to do?

      "Content": "Hi all, hi Helen, I've just had my session with radiotherapy doctor and she said she wouldn't recommend radio as there was no node involvement. Since my initial diagnosis was DCIS I chose to just have the sentinel node taken out and as that was , thankfully, clear, they didn't pursue further. I then had body CT and bone scans for staging as the histopathology showed the grade 3 , Her 2+++, and there's a slight risk of spread even with no lymph involvement but those scans were clear too. The doctor did say that some hospitals still might recommend radio for similar cases but she is not of that school of thought. Only slight confusion in that I'm sure the surgeon said she was in favour. So I'm going to suggest maybe just asking for a second opinion ? AND don't forget you can delay radiotherapy. Whatever happens don't fast forward to worry about things until you actually have to. X take care everyone X  Carolyn",

The dressing used on my mastectomy was just brown hospital tape, I'm not even sure there was anything between the tape and the scar.  I was told to allow the tape to get wet in the shower but not to soak it and it would start to fall away within the two weeks. The bit that wouldn't heal I used dozens of different dressings and spent a small fortune in Boots, nothing worked and the hole remained until I had the revision surgery. I would suggest my current favourite which is the Himalayan pink salt but it's too soon for that, we used it on my brothers dressings after the main wound had healed, about 3 weeks.  I'm not good with itching, I tend to scratch.  Carolyn xx",

I had always said that my good boob was just as suspicious as my affected boob but they dismissed my comments, then at the last mammogram and ultrasound the radiologist finally said there are calcifications but they haven't changed, she's keeping an eye on them. She didn't say 'atypical' but it amounts to the same thing, something that looks a bit suspicious and needs to be watched.  Nobody ever mentioned it before, in fact when I mentioned it they very pretty condescending about my fears.  I feel well in myself, I noted your other post about how we panic at the slightest thing, there's not many days go by when I don't have some kind of twinge that's instantly a liver, lung, bone or brain met. After I had the biopsy in 2015 I reacted badly and found I was nauseous and couldn't eat much, despite having a reasonable appetite, all of which pointed to circulating tumour cells, it is a rare but well documented risk associated with biopsies, affecting about 1 in 20,000 if I remember rightly, I'll try and find a link.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818087 It is this aspect which I'm adding to my watch list for recurrence or spread, so for anything that is persistent and worsening add do you feel a bit nauseous. Nobody wants to actually pester the GP for reassurances, I always seem to feel really stupid, and for me the relief is short lived in any case. The trick seems to be to keep busy, but also stay vigilant, I don't like having to look out for signs and symptoms because it becomes all consuming but the cost of scanning us seems to prohibit them from offering it. I demanded it, mainly because I had so many errors, including the surgeon missing a whole tumour.  Anyway, why did you have the surgery, if they've removed the offending cells there's nothing more needs to be done ?? hugs Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi Jj1  mistymoley  is right, you will need to find some distractions.  I worry that if I don't worry I'll have something to worry about. However, in my experience, the team react when they see something and action things immediately. Remembering back to non routine mammograms I was directed to ultrasound straight away rather than being told to get dressed and go home. In the future, and I realise this won't help you now, all hospitals should follow this procedure : first annual mammogram AND ultrasound ( I believe you should have both) attend mammogram for good breast and move to ultrasound for implant reconstruction and follow up ultrasound for good breast, so mammogram good side, ultrasound both. This way you get to quiz the radiologist on what he or she is looking at and if they're seeing anything suspicious. ALERT: radiologists tend to be brutally honest. We have had some ladies ranting about not being given results over the phone - I know why they do and I also know why they don't. For me this time, my first mammogram, I was told that it absolutely wasn't a problem if I called in for results as the team had been cleared to tell me over the phone. Primarily this was because my onco was away on holiday and she didn't see that I should have to wait more than two weeks to get the results. As it turned out, I knew, because I'd asked on the day, that there was nothing to worry about, then the BCN matron emailed me, within the week,  to tell me the reports were 'all clear'. Then yesterday I did have the follow up results meeting as a formality. For a very brief moment or two it did occur to me that something might have been uncovered but it wasn't a fraught fortnight. This seems to be the kindest most practical solution to this particular part of the process and we could take action as a group to make sure it does happen. Gold star treatment for everyone and no more fraught fortnights, not for the first annual mammo anyway. Carolyn x",

And what types of contraception have you tried ? Even if your periods don't return I'd still seek out fertility advice, I would imagine they will check if you're ovulating, has anyone given you advice on reproductivity generally? Some are offered sperm and egg harvesting etc Personally speaking I reacted badly to the pill and had several IUDs over the years, in between children, and never had any problems. I don't think there's enough information about mechanical rather than chemical contraception, probably because most women soldier on with the side effects, putting up with them rather than trying to find a better solution. There are also zero studies into women who do experience significant side effects and long term use of synthetic hormones. Can't tag on iPad  Carolyn X",

I have a feeling you can have foot therapy free while you're on chemo but I forgot to ask but that would have helped when I moved to the taxane cycles, large patches of skin looked like they were going to fall off and I was already having to wrap my toenails up with a blob of savlon cream to prevent them being pulled off by my socks.

      "Content": "hi Cassa  it's frustrating isn't it I didn't get tested for that specifically but it's going to be scans, biopsies and blood tests, same as everything else. I'm pretty sure they'll be looking for DCIS too, ductal carcnioma in situ, that's an MRI, as well as the mammogram and ultrasound. Do you think you'll get a chance to take a break before you embark on tests ? Or have the tests then take a break whilst waiting for the results ? I wanted to go away somewhere and my team seemed to think that was okay but I didn't in the end, my family didn't want me to, so I soldiered on through surgery and chemo and took a break once I'd finished chemo. Then I went to Sardinia when I'd had my revision surgery. I just needed to treat myself to something special. I know why you're fed up, but better to get it sorted quickly. Surgery is most often our first line of attack / defence, I would imagine they may offer mastectomy.  It took me more than a week to come to terms with that, despite everyone being incredibly upbeat, what with all the elaborate reconstruction options nowadays, it was still horrible to get my head around, but then when my BCN accidentally got her lefts and rights mixed up and I thought I'd got to have a double mastectomy, I accepted that in about 30 seconds. I'm glad I opted for a nipple sacrificing mastectomy, I'd have hated to discover it afterwards. I don't mind my plastic boob now, it's a bit too perky for my liking but it's okay. Carolyn x",

I discussed this with my young and fit echocardiologist, and we agreed that if I'd walked in, slightly out of breath and not too cheerful he'd have been concerned about my overall health and in his speciality he'd have take a bit of an extra look to double check. As it was, I waltzed in, asked him if he'd been on holiday or back to Portugal , since he looked a bit more tanned, began to strip before he'd bothered to close the curtain, what's the point in being modest, he's going to be rubbing lube into my chest in any case, and he'd be amazed if he found anything wrong with me, he's still going to be vigilant but he gets an overall picture. At the mammogram in 2012 the lady who was operating the xray machine took one look at my breasts and pursed her lips, she was the one who should have reported the scans, the slight anomaly would never have got past her, she would have double checked. A new cancer or recurrence or even mets can be quite active in 12 months without really showing symptoms and we're never really sure if that slight twinge is the same as yesterdays slight twinge or was it that twinge from last week ??? Especially as we're quite likely to want to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it's not happening to avoid getting on the merry go round again. rant over Carolyn xx",

The overall risk is 10% but that is ALL cancers and ALL patients. Clearly cancer types and your own situation play a part in whether that is actually the risk for you. I was told that for breast cancer patients the risk was considerably lower and one of the reasons was that we are an easier group to manage, we turn up to our appointments, we take our meds and we look out for risk factors. I'd been guessing at 5%, or half that of the overall.  3% is a good figure to work with as a lot of women are cited as a 3% uplift in outcomes and obviously a 3% uplift versus a 3% risk is actually, no benefit. In fact I think I did say on one thread it was the 3% gang that needs a specific line of support because it's such a difficult decision to make. fingers crossed your score is low Carolyn xx",

      "Content": "I just posted a reply to this somewhere else ?? here again just in case hi Leonaw123 I had an extra wait inflicted on my because I was being transferred back into the NHS because my suspicious area required an MRI and despite my private guy telling me he'd call me the following Friday he then went completely AWOL I googled everything that weekend and it was all doom and gloom, and the lovely team at Macmillan were actually no help, they just kept reciting the same script to look at the links they were sharing  I was furious with everyone and everything, including myself for not spotting a 65mm lump which was now life threatening.  Then the nurse called me to say that she'd booked me a results meeting in the \"Primrose Unit\" which is the cancer centre, so I asked what my results were and she said she couldn't tell me over the phone, and I said why would I need an appointment in the Primrose Unit ???  She said sorry and I muttered something like , you will be ... However once I did manage to get to see the team it turned out to be DCIS which is stage 0 and despite being over 50mm non life threatening, so they were all smiles.  Let's hope that this is what you have, if indeed it turns out to be cancer of any description.  I did have to have a mastectomy because the affected area to good boob ratio was going to make it cosmetically difficult . This roller coaster ride we refer to is terrible for the nerves and you will have to endure some ups and downs, I did eventually go to my GP and got some Lorazepam. hope that helps Carolyn xxx",

I had implant reconstruction so can't do mammogram on left side, so had right side mammogram and ultrasound on both. I'm an impatient patient. But they don't seem to mind.  Te radiologist just laughed at me and said he'd tried really hard to find something but couldn't. Good luck with the 1st annual x hi also to Caitlin59  welcome to the group, sorry to hear you have this diagnosis. I am just finishing my 18 rounds of Herceptin. I am also technically self employed but have a business partner and we talked about what I'd be able to do whilst I was going through chemo. It will vary enormously depending on how you cope and react to the drugs, what side effects you have and what it is that you do and where you do it. We have an office in a university campus and schools and other public places are known germ breeding grounds. Small children are notorious for being infested and infectious. So, without going into intimate detail what is it that you do and I'll see if I can help Carolyn x",

      "Content": "that explanation in one thread : when I was first diagnosed they could only find DCIS, the earliest stage of breast cancer, effectively stage 0, I'd never even heard of it. So they weren't considering chemo, DCIS doesn't respond to chemo, on the whole. But I had a large area that wasn't possible to give a good aesthetic result with a lumpectomy so mastectomy was the consensus. Surgery is by far and away the most effective cure for breast cancer, as with a lot of cancers. Post mastectomy I knew there was a risk of finding invasive breast cancer cells within the breast tissue under the microscope, and I would therefore be upgraded / downgraded depending on your viewpoint. Risk is about 25%. There are two main types of breast cancer, invasive ductal and invasive lobular  (lobular also has an in situ link) The breast tissue is tested for a range of things like how fast the cells are growing and how poorly they are differentiated from normal cells, that gives you your grade, low, medium and high (sometimes 1,2 and 3), and how large the affected area or tumour is and whether it's spread gives you the stage, 0,1,2,3,4.  (sometimes referred to as TNM  link ) They also check for hormone receptors and the human growth hormone, Her2.  (FISH) These results give you your profile, ER positive or negative, PR positive or negative, ER and PR positive, Her2 positive (Her2+++) or negative. Some people are triple positive and some triple negative. ER and PR positive cancers are treated with hormone therapy, Tamoxifen, Anastrozole or Letrozole. Sometimes chemotherapy is recommended, if there's node involvement or multiple tumours, large tumours, but if you have a smallish tumour with no node involvement chemotherapy offers little benefit, 1 or 2% and chemo carries a 10% risk, that's for ALL cancers, ALL patients, much lower for breast cancer because we're easier to manage as a group, we turn up for appointments, we take our medications, we check our temp. and take more precautions against infections. It is for each individual to assess their own risk v benefit , with their specialist teams. Her2+++ are treated with the monoclonal antibody Herceptin or Trastuzumab.  And also , so I'm told, always chemo. no choice. My Her2 score was high +++ and I'm also PR and ER negative. About 20% of breast cancers are Her2+++. The chemotherapy regime I was put on was for stage 3 cancers, they threw the kitchen sink at me. But I'm still here  yay ! I think triple negative also always demands chemotherapy as there are not yet any longer term therapies available to help prevent recurrence. Although, as I said, surgery is by far and away the most effective treatment for breast cancer. I guess I should acknowledge the use of the \"Idiots Guide'   thanks guys more 'Idiots Guide' titles are available from all good book stores Carolyn xxx",

      "Content": "hi Welshie007  welcome to the online community, I hope you're finding your way around okay The 'F' element of your chemo is not essential nowadays and I would certainly ask for that to be taken off your prescription next round. My onco said \"nobody uses F any more' and Sarah also had it removed from her regime after we talked about that. Obviously if you change more than one thing you don't really know what's working and what isn't so do try that first. In the meantime chemo is pretty brutal. You need to stay hydrated and that's difficult when you don't feel like moving let alone getting up to go to the loo all the time. You need to eat when you may not feel like it. And not just toast. And you need to rest. There are quite a few options on pain relief, did your GP offer anything slightly stronger? I swear by DHC (Dihydrocodeine) as it just suited me better than anything else but if your headaches are worse in the evenings it sort of sounds like you need to rest, I used Oxazepam to help me settle or Lorazepam, is more popular, they only give you a few but since you get free prescriptions it's not a problem, other than keep having to go to the pharmacy.

      "Content": "hi Caitlin59  the others are very amusing and part of me can find it funny now but I found it quite alarming. I found that I'd complete a task and think I'd done it perfectly well but a week or two later I'd be looking at the overall tasks and I'd find a swathe of errors, nothing earth shattering but weird things. I think I'd started a task and then thought I'd completed but actually hadn't. It's the only explanation I can think of. My brain would think the task through but my brain to hand co-ordination hadn't quite got there. The really odd thing I found was that when making payments to suppliers I print a copy for my records, as is prudent, but I found two copies of 5 payments pdfs in the folder, I immediately panicked and went back online to check but I clearly hadn't paid everyone twice. I still have no idea what I did or how this happened but it's not the only 'chemo brain' instance. There were quite a few. I was advised not to make any important decisions whilst on chemo, that was my marvelous oncologist who said that. I think she described it as 'not being my sharpest' ... you can say that again. Around about April / May time, 5 months post chemo,  I truly was feeling a lot better but when I look back now there were still times when my brain was not all there, several sandwiches short of a picnic and all those other lovely analogies. My advice would be double check every single thing methodically, which I'm sure you do anyway, I'm not trained in any form of accounting, I just have to do it because it's my company, but on the important stuff we do have our accounts company and our invoices out is done by a freelancer / self employed accounts lady. I wasn't running the risk of pissing of the HMRC but could have easily annoyed a few people. This is the kind of thing you need to be aware of and vigilant against. hope that helps Carolyn x",

I don't think tablet interactions are closely monitored. If you find one doesn't agree with you try a different brand or an alternative medication all together. Letrozole was a topic on here a little while ago and one lady said she definitely didn't get on with it or one brand of it. My bad it was Anastrzole but have a read link it's quite interesting. You've been proactive with work, asking for that refresher course. Is there another training course you could do, it might help massage the grey matter back into functioning better?  And there are some 'brain training' exercises you can do, I've heard of them ... here's an Alzheimers' one but there's plenty, I need to do something, my brain is like marshmallow. now, I need to get up and do something, I have a long list of small things to work through, ticking a few off might cheer me up Carolyn x",

      "Content": "I agree with what Elle said I always seem to catch something on planes, aviation flu I call it. Anything from a runny nose to full on sinus inflammation. I flew in Feb after finishing chemo on Christmas Eve, what's that, 5 weeks post chemo ? I had no hair when I arrived and a 5 o'clock shadow on my head about a week later.  I also had the runniest nose I'd had in a long time after the flight which developed from day 4 and left me a bit knackered for the last couple of days. Got through 10 packs of travel tissues. Nobody stopped me in customs or passport control, only issue was I was going to do full hair (wig) and makeup on the way to the airport but it was dark and then we seemed to fast track through, got to searching and the lady asked me to remove my bobble hat, my face must have told a story because she instantly softened and just had a quick feel around the edges. to be honest the Feb trip was a bit soon, we didn't have the best weather, two of the kids came to keep an eye on me but then I'm mum again and that's always a juggling act. I had surgery when I got back, March 8th. I much preferred my May/June trip to Sardinia on my own.  After being mum for 30 years it was bliss. I got up when I wanted, I went to bed when I felt like it, 9pm or 1am.  I ate what I liked, when I liked.  I hired a little car and drove around to different beaches and had an absolutely marvelous time. I only speak a tiny amount of Italian but managed to communicate, even in the tiny shop that sold the most delicious parma ham I've ever tasted along with some delicious tomatoes. By May/June I was 5 months past chemo, had some hair which I'd dyed brown and nobody really noticed that i'd been ill. Although I did try to get a specific room with sunshine to avoid having to sit by the pool if I didn't feel like it, but as it turned out it was fine, nobody gave my fake boob a second glance. Funniest thing for me was seeing the difference in the type of men who talk to you when you have long hair as opposed to short styles. Give it some careful consideration, there's no point rushing recovery at this stage Carolyn xx Always Baking",

      "Content": "hi Patricia 61  welcome to the online community sorry you've had to find your way here, it's all a bit of a shock when we're first diagnosed, I felt I was asking the same questions over and over and they'd tell me things and I'd forget. I had an MRI scan but it was reported twice and one report showed a 2nd lesion, the other report didn't. My original biopsy only showed DCIS too. I now realise how important it is to have as much information as possible before you act on it. I was told I could safely have a mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction as I 'only' had DCIS, when in fact that wasn't the case, my private consultant had indicated that although they had only found DCIS they'd only taken three small samples and post surgery pathology could reveal invasive cancer and then they'd have to do more tests, and that's what they did. Thankfully nothing was found on my chest, abdomen and pelvis scan, or CAP scan, or my bone scan but then my MRI had shown something to one doctor and not to another. Your team sound like they are being vigilant and that's good. If they know exactly what they are dealing with they can treat you more accurately. What time do you have to be at the hospital ? I was told to be there at 7 am but I got there early, as did all the others who were showing up for their surgeries, it's nerve wracking.  Will you have someone with you ? hugs Carolyn xx",

And you never know, I had everyone on panic stations over my breast mass of 75mm but it turned out it was only DCIS, okay it was worse after the mastectomy but waiting for the biopsy results was agony, I really thought I'd be given 2 to 5 years. Of course I kept that a bit quiet from my family, there would have been plenty of tears and tantrums.  I don't know what to suggest other than a long walk. Borrow a dog from someone ? How about the cinema ?  lose yourself in someone else's drama for a while ?

I had 4 doses of EC, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, the EC of FEC, every three weeks and then 4 doses of accelerated T every two weeks, with the Herceptin being introduced with the T. The Perjeta combination came in during the last year I think. I'd have felt happier with it but we'll just have to see how it goes. Anyway, I'm a complete wimp and I got through it. Veins were a problem and we all agreed pretty quickly that I needed a PICC line and after that it was a breeze.  As Julia said, drink plenty it really does help. They gave me a lorazepam tablet for the PICC line, they don't like you jumping around, that's one of the anxiety meds that's metabolised in the gut rather than the liver and I'm thinking these will be okay to take in advance of the chemo. LOT, is the way to remember them, Lorazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam. Since you're on free prescriptions your GP should have no issue with giving you a few to get you through this week. I was really lucky with side effects and didn't have any infections, in fact with my wig on most people didn't even realise I was being treated. the constipation v diarrhea balancing act was the trickiest part All in all I'd say it's the waiting that's the worst, the day itself was a bit of an anticlimax, the doctor took an age to clear the drugs and give me one last pep talk so it was getting quite late, so we scrapped the idea of the cold cap and frankly I was relieved I didn't have to 'give it a go'. anything else just shout : ) Carolyn xx",

Firstly surgery is by far and away the most effective treatment for breast cancer, may I ask which type of breast cancer you had, I say 'had' because it's gone now, since you had a lumpectomy. I needed chemo because I had Her2+ breast cancer which is a bit sneaky and doesn't respond to any of the hormone inhibitors. I had EC and T and I wasn't sick at all although I did have diarrhea but they have good meds for all the side effects. The 'E' component is Epirubicin and it does make your hair fall out but I got myself a nice wig and practiced painting eyebrows with my Bobbi Brown eyebrow kit. The other thing with breast cancer chemo is that the steroids they give you make you hungry and a lot of people put on weight rather than lost it. Since volunteering here I realise that chemotherapy does have a vital part to play in treating cancers but not all cancers require chemotherapy. Have you got friends and family around you ?

      "Content": "hi Violet25  I can hear something I can relate to and it's about overall body image rather than specific cup sizes When I was told I was going to need a mastectomy I wanted to take my boobs, the only part of my body I was remotely comfortable with, for one final beach holiday to mourn their loss, to bid farewell to my life as it was, to grieve for my body that would never be the same again and it is a situation where grief is an appropriate word I heard the stages of grief listed a few years ago, not in a cancer context but it made perfect sense shock, disbelief and denial, followed by sadness and anger, blaming and bargaining and then a gradual acceptance  I have accepted my new fake boob largely because the first surgery resulted in something quite hideous and this is much better. I'm going to advocate a delayed reconstruction for you, I think it makes much more sense.  Take time to accept the diagnosis first, let your body heal after all the treatment , get well again and then make decisions on the cosmetics.  I had an immediate implant reconstruction to give me a breast shape and it works in a bikini, I've taken it out to the beach a few times and I'm happy with it.  I may decide that I want something more natural at some point but then again, now I've had a chance to accept it, I may not. yours sincerely  wonky fake barbie tit  Carolyn xxxxx",

I can't remember now, I know food didn't taste of anything much and my snack of choice was cheese and biscuits because it was less cardboardy than other things. In fact it was the texture of food that was more of an issue for me, I had to hide apples in porridge. maybe add this into the January chemo club ? Carolyn x",

      "Content": "hi Tetleysscooby   that's a lot to take in. it's a good thing you noticed the slight indent, I had always had lumpy breasts and had been reassured many times that there was nothing sinister going on but then I had a bout of stress and approaching 50 started to feel the first indications of menopause but every time I went to the doctor it was always my hormones or my age and I left feeling reassured. Eventually I booked myself a private mammogram and what a shock, the radiologist showed me the mammogram as he was doing the ultrasound, that's standard if you go privately by the way, it's a better gauge of what's going on, and there on the screen he measured out 75mm ... yes a whopping 75mm, that's like a tennis ball.  I felt so stupid that I couldn't feel anything but he said it was flat, not a lump, the only 'lump' I could feel was the edge of it, once it was so big it was poking out the side of my boob.  I had truly pestered my GP, looking back, I'd never been to see him then went 20 times in a few months. Then the results came back as DCIS, which is very early stage breast cancer and is 'just' treated with a mastectomy. Everyone was so blasé about that too. it was 'only' DCIS and I'd 'only' need a mastectomy. great. and why were they all smiling.  ???? I was furious that my routine mammogram had missed the start of this cancer back in 2012 but truly grateful that it hadn't spread. While I was waiting for my results all I could find was anything over 50mm was either stage 3 or stage 4, I felt doomed. Although the DCIS was then really good news, for me it really wasn't.  And besides I was then found to have invasive Her2+++ cancer after my mastectomy, so had to go through all the staging scans and eventually was right back to the original stage 3 or 4 but thankfully it's not spread. Rollercoaster is a really fitting term. I think it's harder for people watching us go through it, I was so glad it was me and not one of my kids . Keep talking to your partner and keep him involved, there's usually some decisions to be made or research that can be done. I had to have an MRI after the original round of mammograms, ultrasounds and biopsies. It all helps get a better picture of what we're dealing with. please stick to the tried and trusted web sites for info, like Macmillan, Cancer Research UK and Breast Cancer Care Carolyn x",

      "Content": "hi Dee KiwiCardi  I complained via their website [The Royal Marsden.], they have a 'complaints, compliments and feedback' area, with an online form. at the first attempt I probably rambled on too much but ]they] called me straight away to try and clarify what was wrong and what could be done about it. He recommended writing down what my issues were and what I'd like done about it, they like a quick solution that you'll be happy with. You have two issues,correct me if I'm wrong at any point ... one is the PICC or portacath, personally my PICC was absolutely fine, I had no issues with it and I can highly recommend it as an alternative to cannulation. Secondly you are experiencing delays and you are due to have herceptin which means you're Her2+++ , correct ? Say you are finding the waiting incredibly stressful and you just need to find out what's taking so long, or words to that effect. At least then they'll have a chance to either explain their reasoning for the delays or act and get you in quicker. Some tests do take time and, much as we love to believe we're the top priority, the hospital has to function and schedules can be tricky to manage. However there are guidelines and limits for waiting for treatment. let me know if that sounds reasonable ? by the way, training is an ongoing problem in a lot of hospitals, they just don't have enough staff to keep the place running smoothly, so I don't think we can view training on the portacath as a quick fix solution.  One of my nurses, has been training for over  a year now and has only just graduated to inserting cannulas, it'll be another 6 months before he's close to using the PICC lines.

Try not to panic everything may be fine and better to get it checked. Hopefully someone else will have had a similar experience and will reassure you more than me.  I totally sympathise on the PICC my veins are 'shy' I'm not making that up and all the nurses agreed it was the only way to go , it was a breeze after that , except when I poked myself in the eye, but that was me being clumsy .

Time wise, I was diagnosed last May, although me referral letter is dated 15th March,  and started chemo 17th August and it did seem to take forever to get through all the scans but once they decided I did need chemo the rushed me through bone and CAP scans. I know my BCN had something to do with that but I was suspicious at the time it was more about national guidelines than my piece of mind Might be worth a call to PALS ? I'm on the train at the moment but I found someone in the hospital whose job was to sort this kind of thing. I'll check his job title for you Carolyn X",

      "Content": "hi all I'm similar to Fandango as I had a large area of DCIS but I WAS warned by my private consultant that I may be upgraded after the surgery, the London NHS team then pretty much scorned that advice and told me I wasn't urgent as it was only DCIS. It does seem to vary how they share this information . It took me a while to find it but the risk is apparently 20%, I was slightly more likely to be in the 20% because I knew I'd had my suspicious area for more than 3 years. I was found to have invasive Her2+ and was told they always recommend chemo for that and I'm ER -  so no hormone inhibitors. IF you do have invasive areas in the DCIS and it is ER+ then you'll be offered tamoxifen or similar and these are very effective at preventing recurrence and spread. You may be offered chemotherapy as well. IF you have Her2+ or triple negative invasive components they like you to have chemotherapy as it reduces the risk of recurrence or spread. I had 4 rounds of EC which is Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide , every three weeks and then 4 rounds of accelerated T every two weeks with Herceptin every three weeks. I was dreading it but I survived and it wasn't actually as bad as I thought it might be. It took me a couple of weeks to get a grip on the idea and I did ask around, trying to find trying to find reassurances that not having chemo was a better idea. Eventually my oncologist held my hand and said, I'd not be advising this if I didn't think it was the right thing for you. hugs Carolyn xxx",

MRI report was done twice, first by private guy, who picked up the 2nd lesion,  and then by the Royal Marsden in London, the 'top' cancer hospital, who didn't.  Surgeon marked up boob and I took the trouble to point out the 2nd lesion which was now an obvious lump in my chest, not even obscured by boob  post op discovered that the surgeon had missed the 2nd tumour completely.  post op histopathology showed Her2+++ and then everything suddenly became very urgent indeed as I was sent for staging scans that I was told I wouldn't need and then on to oncology  so yes, a catalogue of errors from top professionals  only here today because I made a fuss and raised a complaint  Carolyn xx",
