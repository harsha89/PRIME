I have spoken to my mums Dr recently and I am going to write to the Dr's at the hospital that treated my mum but I doubt they will be able to tell me a great deal from their notes. I guess I am going to have to try and piece things together and as you suggest maybe try and talk to a specialist Nurse for some clarification maybe. Thank you again xxx",

      "Content": "My mum passed away last month suddenly from advanced breast cancer. She went into hospital with breathing problems and fluid on the lungs and then we were told she had breast cancer. She died within a week. I have since discovered from her GP she had not been diagnosed via him for cancer and this has all come as a big shock for the family. I have been reading re the symptoms etc.. and wondering whether she might have known and chosen to ignore them?? Her GP has suggested being a single female of her age (63) it is possible she chose to do nothing if she was scared? I can't see that but do understand denial. I have so many questions with everything happening so quickly and no-one to give me any answers, I want to know how long she might have had this and why it all happened so quickly but who can I really ask and get any answers? Her GP cannot answer me as he hasn't anything to tell me. I could write to the hospital where she was treated but their records would be limited. I want to know how long she might have had this cancer, I know they couldn't treat it as she had become so weak so very quickly but does this mean she had the cancer for a long time or had she had a particularly aggressive form of it? Who can I ask? Can anyone suggest anything??? Many thanks xxx",
