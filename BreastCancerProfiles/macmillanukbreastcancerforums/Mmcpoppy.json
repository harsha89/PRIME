      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your Mum and some of your family. The problem is with them so don't beat yourself up. You deserve better unfortunately you can't pick your family but you can choose not to punish yourself for their ignorance and selfishness. My mother is a waste of space too, when I told her my diagnosis she said I needed to be careful as it can kill you! She then went on to explain that as I was fat it was all my fault. I was shocked, upset and guilt ridden for about a week. but then decided she was talking rubbish and decided to save my energy for getting better. Now I laugh about her ignorance, we communicate but I save my energy and love for my daughter, friends and work colleagues who care and support me. Two fingers to Mum's like yours and mine leave the baggage with them it's not yours to pick up x",

      "Content": "Hello, completely understand how you feel, I have family including an 18 year old with major exams. Being diagnosed just a few weeks back left us all shell-shocked especially as I am never I'll and had been feeling marvellous. After discussions etc, I was recommended to have a right mastectomy and axilliary clearance followed by Chemo and Radiotherapy. After all of this I can then go for a reconstruction. i am three weeks post surgery, I have decided I am going to have a positive mindset to this and overcome it. my doctor tells me there is no reason why I should not have a good outcome. Not imediately but after surgery I even found a few things to laugh at which has helped myself and my family. In terms of good news I met a lady recently who is 9 years clear from her diagnosis , also being a newbie myself there is great support on this forum which I am always grateful for. I have told my family that I want a bit of support of course but mostly I just want life to be as normal as possible for them and me. i was very scared but amazingly once I had the surgery and the Cancer out then I have only felt relief. My goal is to get to reconstruction and have a younger looking pair of boobs so I look like Angelina Jolie. Might be difficult at 58 years old but that is my goal. i hope that you will find something that helps you and your family get through this and personally wish you well. hugs Maggie",
