      "Content": "Hi there,  I really hope no-one minds me posting here.  I have experienced pain in my underarm for sometime now and am recently experiencing breast pain on that side. May not be connected but last year I noticed a fairly large lump on my arm (same side) and at ultrasound, they found nothing sinister, just tissue.  I experience the odd pain up and down my arm.  I have pain in upper outer section of my breast behind nipple at times and underneath occasionally. It used to be far more in my underarm and def more breast too.  Gp did exam, couldn't find anything but said may be drainage issues? Referred me to GP at surgery who works in the breast clinic, to discuss how to manage the pain.  I also have pain and slight lumpiness at back if knee, just above (same side).  Also discussed my fatigue which could just be down to stress (few family worries) but she referred me for blood test (awaiting results) just incase.  Am I over worrying?! What do you think? Any similar experiences?  Thanks so much and hope u don't mind me posting. Xx",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply and sharing experiences. I have had blood tests back, all clear and examination - no lumps or changes. I need to book appointment with breast clinic nurse to discuss discomfort on one side. Tricky as I have certain commitments and she works part time... I still have some pain and v tender/painful to touch in places. Mainly upper, outer side, armpit And sometimes nipple area. Today, where I have been feeling for poss thickening (not sure) i noticed a few blood spots, like slight bruising. Never had this before. Feels warm to tingly sensastion, but not physically warm to touch.",
