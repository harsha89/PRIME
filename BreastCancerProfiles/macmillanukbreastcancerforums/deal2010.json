    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 weeks ago and am about to start chemo tomorrow.  I appear to be doing things a different way to everyone else!  Due to the size of my lump, if I had it removed, they would have to take the whole breast away.  A scan showed that I have some cancer in one node, but not under my arms. Thus, they are going to try and shrink the lump to try and save my breast.  I am very upbeat about starting my chemo tomorrow, but am a little concerned about the side effects.  I am 39 and like you Sue, have no kids and am happily married.  I too have to be on Tamoxifen for 5 years and this pretty much rules out kids. I want to keep working through my chemo - I am a teacher - is this feasible?     Great to have found this site today!!",
