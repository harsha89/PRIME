    "Content": "Hi Tracy,      Good news.  Not everyone gets lymphedemia.  Often it isn't caused by the surgery but by incidents after surgery.  Your lymph nodes help to move your lymph through your system.  Nodes are throuout your body.  Even if your surgeon removes all of them from your armpit you will have plenty in your body.  They will need a little help so learn the soft tissue massage to keep it flowing.  After surgery try not to burn yourself or fall down stairs or get hit with a large box of candy.  With accidents, the lymph floods the affected area and without the nodes to keep the lymph moving it can build up in the area where nodes have been removed.  The sleeve is a good way to keep that from happening but the massage can move it along.  Lymph therapist are using a new item which your insurance may pay for.  You can use it at home instead of treatments at a physical therapists office.  It's amazing (makes you look like you are in a bear suit).  It gives the massage in the area needed and can be adjusted for full body massage.        My lymphedemia didn't show up until almost two years after my last surgery and only after a Pepsi vendor hit my right arm with a case of candy.  The lymph nodes had been removed from my left arm but the contusion on my right arm caused the lymph to pool in my left arm where it wasn't being pulled out by the nodes.  Luckily my doctor noticed the arm expanding at my next visit and sent me to a lymph therapist.  (Not all physical therapist have lymphedemia training, make sure yours does.)  Most people looking at me don't realize I have Stage 4 IBC.  And very few know I have lymphedemia unless I choose to tell them.  It can be controlled but it takes work on your part.  So roll up your sleeves.  Its going to be a bumpy ride but you csn make it thru and smile about it once they stop sticking you with needles.",
