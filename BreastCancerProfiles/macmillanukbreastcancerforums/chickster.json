    "Content": "Hi Kerry, I finished my chemo on 16th nov and had the cold cap on all 6 treatments, it is excruciating at the time but my headaches wore off after a day but left me with a very achy tender head for over a week but it was bareable. The FEC does cause sickness i suffered badly with this and had to eat small amounts of food reguarly to help this I didn't feel like my normal food or drinks but peppermint tea really helped the sickness esp. when i wasn't hungry. i struggled emotionally with having the cold cap, i felt i was putting myself through pain for my vanity but for what its worth i had some hair loss but managed to keep enough not to wear a wig. Wishing you friend all the best with her treatment. Nikki.x",
