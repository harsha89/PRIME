      "Content": "Today is Day 7 (Fec-T started on Monday 24th.  I have followed instructions and meds etc with only slight nausea first thing in the morning.  However, I have one question.  I have read of women who have their chemo then go to work, shopping etc.  Am I being a softy?  I am absolutely knocked out, although eating well, but could sleep all day and night if I didnt force myself to do stuff in the house. Again, not ill just really tired.  Any comments would be welcome.  I am quite happy if that is normal, dozing is nice lol",
