      "Content": "Hi Cycling Girl I am new to this site and was recently diagnosed with probable breast cancer, they are not 100% sure but it has spread to my bones, I am male so I have been categorised as a highly unusual case. Just had my 2nd chemo yesterday, only four more to look forward to, joy! Read your survival kit with interest and wonder whether you may have any additional info for the male society. and anything on getting a good night's sleep. All the best. Jim.D",

      "Content": "Thanks Mike sorry what does FEC stand for? I take it that the treatment has finished? The sleep is due to the fact I take steroids and has messed my sleeping pattern up, so trying to come to terms with it. Wow you had the left breast removed, has it been rebuilt in any way? All the best",
