      "Content": "Well said Lesleyhelen its a total farce all this talk in the media about obesity leading to cancer implying that its our fault we got it. I was a lean size 8 when I was dx with both primary and secondarys 7 years ago, for the first time in my life since being dx I have put on an incredible 5 stone in the first 2 years after dx not from scoffing cakes but from all the treatments, chemo, steroids, herceptin, chemical menopause, as far as i'm concerned its a load of waffle about obesity and cancer, in light of this and if the media really believe it is obesity that is causing cancer then why oh why raise money by baking cakes, it begs belief! This disease affects both young and old, fat and thin, healthy and unhealthy lifestyles, also affects animals so how can they realistically blame it on obesity. My oncologist said \"if we have a cause we have a cure\" and unfortunately we don't have a cause yet. I am eternally grateful for still being here as a survivor living with cancer and I've got nothing against people raising money to help find the cause or raising awareness. I don't play the blame game anymore because it isn't my fault I got cancer, I simply don't know why neither does anyone else. I live for the moment and love life. Love to allxxx",

      "Content": "Bobbylou please do not feel guilty about being overweight, obesity isn't the cause of cancer because if it was we would of had a cure by now. I was size 8 (had been my whole life) when at 42 I was dx with both primary and secondary breast cancer (spread to both lungs and liver) that was 7 years ago and they can't find any trace of the disease on my secondary sites although I was told that the cells might be so small that the CT scanner can't pick them up, essentially I am not in remission but I am in control and stable. Being a small size my whole life I didn't realise what a shock of putting on weight would do to me, in two years I went from a size 8-18! I wouldn't of minded if I'd been scoffing cakes all day but I had been eating really healthy no dairy, bread, potatoes or meat just green juices everyday. I put on a whooping 5 stone in two years. Its a load of rubbish to say its obesity I wasn't obese before I got this and now I am obese as a result of trying to treat this thing. All the chemo, steroids and other drugs also a chemical menopause all of which add to the overall weight gain. whilst I am eternally grateful for still being alive I do find it difficult to operate daily with the side effects hot flushes off the scale, out of breath constantly, joint pain all over, swollen and uncomfortable, weekly migraines as well as other smaller annoyances like constipation and diarrhoea. Life as a survivor isn't easy and being told by the media that its our fault (or making us feel like its our fault) is totally ridiculous. Its random covers a broad spectrum of body shapes, lifestyles, genders, and breeds both animals and humans suffer from this. Please don't play the blame game it will break you, live for the moment and enjoy the day. Love to all xxx",
