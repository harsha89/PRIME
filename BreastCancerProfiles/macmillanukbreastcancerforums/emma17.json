      "Content": "hi,thank you for the reply,its just the one nipple,its the same one i have lump, i have told them about the nipple,the itch,the bleed (although im convinced i scratched it to cause this as there was a small nic) the discharge that i get left with in the bra on some days, but they just took biopsys from lump area, i know we should not 'google' but i have read a few stories how doctors have said its fine and missed it, guess my best bet is to just wait for results and if itch persists get back to the doctorÂ  thank you Emma",

      "Content": "hello there,i had a fine needle asperation a while back which came back abnormal,and had a vacumme assisted biopsy yesterday,due to a breast lump and itchy nipples, my scan showed a lot of cysts and nothing ivasive,but my nipple has been itching and driving me mad for months,i had nipple examined visually but no biopsy on nipple just the lump at the side etc,they seem to have biparsed this,but after reading pagets,and a mention of it to me by a few people im a little concerned as doctors not tested this area,i have seen its often mis diagnosed,what should i say to doctors if my results come back clear,or do i just leave it that they know what they are doing x",
