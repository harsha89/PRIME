    "Content": "Hi,  I have been going through FEC-T chemotherapy and finished my 3 courses of FEC just under 4 weeks ago. Last week I went in for my first round of Docetaxel, after 5ml and about a minute into the treatment I had an allergic reaction which was quite severe, my throat started closing up, my chest went tight, I was struggling to breathe, seeing stars and to be quite honest felt like I was on my way to meet my maker. I have never been so terrified in my life!  Obviously the nurses were quick to get to me and pump me full of antihystemines and steriods and get me back to normal but now i have to start on Abraxane on Wednesday. The doctor that came to assess me after the reaction told me that the allergy was most likely to have been caused by the solvent that goes with the Docetaxel and not the drug itself and that the Abraxane is of the same family as Docetaxel but a veriety that doesn't require the same solvent.  I am now petrified of having the same reaction to the Abraxane and my reaction not being related to the solvent at all. I was wondering if anyone else has had this happen and how they coped on Abraxane and dealt with the anxiety of having to change to another unknown.  Thank you Shelley x",
