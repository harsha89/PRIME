      "Content": "It\u2019s been good to read through this thread ... I had surgery 30th Nov 17, TNBC invasive 2.9cm tumour, removed with clear margins and no lymph involvement ... I started chemo (FEC-T) 16th Jan 18. Had 3 FEC, then 1 T but I\u2019ve had so many problems after the first T that my oncologist has decided to both delay my 5th chemo by a week an put me back on FEC for cycles 5 & 6. I was originally down for Radiotherapy but then discovered almost at the end of Dec 17 that the BRCA1 gene fault is very strong in my dad\u2019s family, so my oncologist told me I wouldn\u2019t have Radiotherapy as I\u2019d probably need risk reducing surgery once I\u2019d been through all the screening etc and there wouldn\u2019t be a need for Radiotherapy as a result. So I booked a long weekend break for my husband and I the celebrate our 30th anniversary on 8th June as it would fall after I\u2019d finished my chemo ... but now as the gene people work so VERY VERY slowly, my oncologist says I\u2019m going to have to have Radiotherapy because if we leave it until I\u2019ve been through the counselling etc it will be too late for Radiotherapy ... I\u2019m wanting to delay the Radiotherapy until after our weekend away. This thread has helped me see that the short delay I\u2019m talking about here is not going to be a problem, although I\u2019m still waiting to confirm the 2 planning appointments, I feel better about the request I intend to make. Thank you x",

But then in October (saw GP 24th) I decided to ask to get the cyst Aspirated, so on 8th Nov I got my appointment with the Breast Clinic. Turned out that it wasn\u2019t a cyst ... they did a Biopsy there and then. I had surgery on 30th Nov and I\u2019m due to start chemo next week. Even though I left it those weeks, it hadn\u2019t spread beyond the breast (mine\u2019s the left breast too). You have done the right thing by going in right away ... hopefully it\u2019ll be a benign lump that you\u2019ve found. Try to stay positive hun xx",

I mentioned that the BRCA gene misprint was in my dad\u2019s family and he asked that I find out who has had cancer and if they had been tested for BRCA or not. He said that Subject to being tested for BRCA, I wouldn\u2019t be having Radiotherapy unti we know if I have the BRCA misprint or not. So I called my aunt ... and here\u2019s the list! In my Nan\u2019s generation: My Nan had her overies removed, but we don\u2019t know why. Three great aunts also died from cancer, one we know which was breast cancer. In my Aunt\u2019s generation: I have three aunts, one died from pancreatic cancer, not BRCA tested. Another is BRCA1 and had one breast removed. The aunt that I\u2019ve been in touch with had ovarian cancer in 1997 and breast cancer in 2011, this is when she got tested for BRCA and this then started the whole thing off. She\u2019s BRCA1 and has had a double mastectomy. In my generation: I have two female cousins who are both BRCA1 positive and have both had overies removed and double mastectomies (one age 34). In my daughter\u2019s generation: So far there is one female who has been tested and she is BRCA1 and has had a mastectomy already. So I\u2019ve left a message for the Breast Care Team to call me back. In the meantime, I will be starting Chemo either on 09/01 or 16/01.",

      "Content": "I am now 23 days post op (3cm, grade 3 TNBC removed by WLE, Plus clear SNB) and due to see the Oncologist on 27th Dec, to talk about starting my chemo treatment. I have just received a message from a concerned paternal aunt. The message was regarding the BRCA gene and that it is very strong in my dad\u2019s side of the family. This aunt has herself had a double mastectomy as a result. I had heard of the BRCA gene but did not know it was of concern for me as my dad is not very good at feeding information (he seems to be in denial about my cancer, even though the tumour is gone now) to people who should know, I\u2019m not in touch with the extended family at all, so I had no idea about this family trait. Now I am concerned about finding out more, my mum (dad\u2019s useless) told me that my aunt (dad\u2019s sister) does talks about the BRCA gene. I am now concerned about my daughter and also my grand daughter. I think we should all get tested, I am unsure whether to just ask the Oncologist about this or if I should call the breast Care nurse first thing on Wednesday (not sure if anyone will be there on 25th and 26th Dec). I\u2019m thinking the oncologist will probably tell me to go see staff in the breast care unit anyway. My aunt did say for me to call her, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that yet, emotionally or otherwise, I\u2019ve not seen her or spoken to her for many years (or any of the relatives on that side of my family really).",

In younger women the periods can restart but in women who are peri menopausal they can stop and that\u2019s that! Trouble is with the hot flushes! My periods were rather erratic before I started chemo and I had a period just a a week before I started chemo in January and I\u2019ve not had one since. I found that my hot flushes were more viscous while I was taking the steroids in the week after treatment, then they calmed down a bit. I\u2019m still getting plenty, day and night, now that I\u2019ve finished my chemo, and as my cancer was Triple Negative, I don\u2019t think I can go on HRT now, I was considering HRT price to finding out I had BC.",

      "Content": "My temperature spikes have happened since my G-CFS injections. The said I did have a stay in hospital due to Sepsis after my last FEC, so when I had my first T treatment I had to have 7 days worth of G-CFS jabs. I\u2019ve not been right since the T treatment, so my oncologist has put me back on FEC, as I can't have the Docetaxel without the G-CFS. So my Wed to Monday stay last week saw my chemo postponed by a week and the change back to FEC, then I had an overnight stay Fri/Sat just gone seems to have triggered another postponement, only no one saw fit to let me know ... which I\u2019m cross about! I am now hoping that my body sorts itself out by next Tuesday so that I can get back on track again! I am at home and hoping to stay here until next Monday when I need to get mt pre chemo blood test! Keep strong everyone xx",

      "Content": "Dear DL It was totally unexpected that I got changed back to FEC, part of the decision seems to have been the reaction I\u2019ve had to the T and the G-CFS injections, I can\u2019t have the T without the G-CFS injections as it\u2019s too dangerous (having had Sepsis on the FEC). It may be worth asking your team about though, I hadn\u2019t even considered it was a possibility.",

It\u2019s good though to see you are feeling less negative about your chemo, keep talking to the nurses and your family, they can all help you. Take care of yourself xx",

      "Content": "Thanks guys ... I did have to get grumpy last night though. I was told my cannula could come out at around 4pm, I asked three times about it coming out and was told someone would come and do it ... 4 hours and a shift change later, thevthing is still in my arm and the new nurse had said, I\u2019ll get someone to do it. Shevthen came back 15 minutes later with my oral antibiotics! I was sat in my chair and she said shall I bring you some water? So I told her I wasn\u2019t taking them until my cannula was removed, she went off muttering something, within 15 minutes someone came and took the cannula out! Never saw the nurse again ... maybe I\u2019ll see her this morning with my meds? I am uncertain how many times a day I\u2019m meant to have the oral antibiotics, I guess I\u2019ll find out. I can self administer my Ranitidine and Cetirizine, so I\u2019ll go ahead and do that as it\u2019s now 7:14am. GET ME OUT OF THIS TEAPOT!!",

I also need to find out what\u2019s happening with my chemo, has it been postponed or not?  My discharge papers say I\u2019m still down for follow up this afternoon in Oncology, which I wouldn\u2019t have know if I hadn\u2019t have looked at them. Last thing I knew was they were saying it would be pushed back a week... no further information, so I\u2019m going to have to enquire, which has to wait until after 9am! Onwards brave ladies, onwards!!",

My oncologist has said he\u2019s putting me back on FEC for my last two treatments as I have not had the best reaction to the T treatment or the G-CFS injections. 9 days (10 counting the one I spent in A&E) in hospital altogether. Plus as I have still not heard from genetics, he\u2019s put me through for Radiotherapy to start about 3cweeks after I finish my chemotherapy. My next treatment will be sometime next week, from Tuesday onward. I\u2019ve booked my blood test with my GP surgery on Monday, under the consultant\u2019s advice! So now I want to enjoy my week ahead and will try not to over do anything! That I you all for you good wishes, I hope that I can get through the next two treatments without any further hospital stays!",

I get it all the time! i don\u2019t do it on purpose, except for just getting on with things ... my little brother said recently that the thing he\u2019s always admired in me is my getonwithitness, I don\u2019t know how to be any other way, even when I could scream from pure frustration. When I\u2019ve had days (raising kids with autism) where I\u2019ve just cried while stood at the window, took a deep breath and then carried on! Just get on with it, it\u2019s how I know. It can actually be quite painful, when all you want is help and support but everyone else, just looks at the surface thinks you\u2019re doing just fine! I am getting a lot of support now though and I am learning how to accept that suppor, although it does not come easy to me at all. Thanks to all for your positive comments, I hope everyone finds a good place from where to launch into their new and enforced profiles, it\u2019s the new you for now and it\u2019s only tempt, but it\u2019s who you are now ... xxx",

It turns out that as I was in overnight on Friday my chemo has been pushed back another week ... only no one told me!! So I was told to sit in the waiting room and when the nurse came to get me, it was to ask about my temperature, which as it happens had gone back up to 37.6 at 1pm, so I\u2019d taken 2 Paracetamol. Trouble is that it was still 37.6 at 3pm, so Dr said No, too dangerous! I now have to move all the other appointments that have been made and then hope that my temperature doesn\u2019t go up high enough tonight to mean I have to go back in again ...  Just a tiny bit frustrated!!",
