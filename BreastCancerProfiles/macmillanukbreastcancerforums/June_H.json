In fact Herceptin was very much a post-code lottery with a number of Health Trusts refusing to pay. Yet here I am benefitting so much from what I know is a very expensive treatment    Surely others would agree that this applies to these other drugs Take Care June",

I had supportive employers and a phased return. My job is extremely busy and initially I found I was shattered and coming straight home and going to sleep I was so exhausted With hindsight I might have done 2 things a bit differently I would have taken more time before returning and used that time to build some stamina. I also would have worked maybe a 4 as opposed to a 5 day week for longer to help with the tiredness I have been back for 7 months full time and some weeks I am still really tired. It is getting better but after all our bodies go through it is not surprising that getting back to work is much harder than first imagined If you can be really kind to yourself Good Luck June",

On my second cycle I returned to a very busy and demanding job I had a syringe driver with anti sickness meds in my chest which I tried to disguise with scarves and which needed changed every 24 hours. The hospital was 5 minutes from work and I went there got the syringe changed and went to work. Although folks were lovely once at work it is full on and I really struggled but thought it would get better. Eventually after 3 weeks I had to admit defeat and the best thing I did was to focus on me and getting better. However being career minded and after finishing rads I went back I started on a phased return but within 4 weeks i would literally sit in hospital getting Herceptin while working on my iPad and before driving to work To be honest I agree everyone needs to go with what feels right for them but it is nearly one and half years since I started back and I am still pretty knackered and trying to cope with the effects of Anastrozole. Being focused on work helped in some ways but at the end of the day health is more important and I think I learned that the hard way Happy New Year to all J x",

So the first week was a bit of a write off the second better and the third normal. So I did things and stocked up with shopping etc when I felt well and took it easy and lived off what I had stored up when I needed to. Ginger helped with taste and sickness and pineapple with mouth problems. I made ice lollies from pineapple which I used when desired.

A month later I had my routine annual check up and mammogram. I was told that they usually sent the results by post in the normal way I was asked to wait and after a few minutes the consultant radiographer appeared and said all looked clear and I think this was specifically because she had diagnosed me last year and knew how important this was. In April after my final Herceptin I saw the oncologist who after telling me after her examination that all was well told me after I asked her about my specific odds for the future what my predicted outlook was which I must say looks pretty pretty good. I don't suppose I will ever not have that bit of doubt each year but all of the people I mentioned are all on my side and I have beaten this awful thing before and I have a good outlook I will try and hold onto that at each check up as a kind of charm Hugs to all June",

      "Content": "I well remember that feeling and also feeling that it was so unfair that I had endured a lot of treatments and now somehow should be so much better For me it was time and despite all of the other things it was the passing of time and having a bit of patience especially with myself that helped I am 3 years on   I am now working full time in a very demanding job . I swim at weekends and walk my dogs.  Am I back to where I was before? ,Maybe not quite. My bones and joints hurt and that is the armidex but I am determined to keep taking it  I do some things different and am knitting and reading more  Be kind to yourself   As you put more distance between that awful time things will gradually seem better  You are still healing and recovering  Take Care June ",

What I did not know till later was the details that it was positive for oestrogen and her2 till later. I guess it depends on the hospital but I know mine was brilliant at every stage. Wishing you good luck. Take Care June",

      "Content": "I think losing hair and getting the wig somehow makes the diagnosis and impending treatments so real and likewise the re growing of our hair no matter how slow kind of symbolises the recovery I ended up not wearing mine except for a few occasions and got quite into lots of scarves and big earrings and making my new but temporary look The thing is this is temporary and like aroma mum says you will get through it . I think some partners don't know how to react but if you need to cry then you surely are entitled As a little aside at 57 I ended up in our local press last week dressed as a tree with leaves coming out of my hair as part of an event at work. When I expressed my horror my family said that in less than a year I had come a long way as 10 months ago I was a bald woman \"dressing up\" in a wig. LOL which put things in perspective Please take care Patricia and all of us who have experienced what you are going through will understand J. X",

      "Content": "In Jan 2012 I had a WLE . I had chemo .RT and Herceptin and 5 years Anastrozole and now in 5 years tamoxifen . I might be unusal with this part of my issue. My tumor was almost 3 cm and was removed from my left breast ,just under my nipple slighltly to theright part of my breast. In the beginning I was too busy coming to grips with chemo etc then getting back to work   At my 1st and 2nd year all clear I was offered reconstruction in the form of sucking fat from my body and injecting it into my breast  I was understandably not keen to have anything else out into my breast even if it was from a part of me  . I am so lucky and had my 5 year all clear earlier this year   I am now coping at work and swimming and walking my dogs . However recently I have had problems with this breast  My surgery initaly made my breast look as if it had an inverted nipple . Now this nipple is firmly tucked into my breast ( in the space where this tumour was) I have had infections recently where both blood and pus have emanated from said place and this has been sore and also I have felt unwell. For the moment antibiotics have cleared this up however the root cause is not sorted  my breast consultant has said that i6t is too late for the liposuction offer but a full revision may cost me my nipple  I wondered if anyone else has had issues so long after getting rid of this critter ",

It was from a motorcycle shop and used under helmets. I really wished I had thought of that. Lots of choice and not expensive. Good luck June",

I was told that some of the cause was the after effect of RT My lump was not painful at diagnosis either and I am reassured by my breast consultant who also made it clear I could see her at any time which I did and was given real reassurance Take care June",
