      "Content": "I was absolutely petrified of my first chemo aswell i would have much rather have went through another op but it was nothing compared to what i thought it would be. I had my first session last fri and apart from feeling a little sick and having sore hands and feet the first night ive been great.I cant believe it tbh as i had stressed myself out for weeks its been a bit of an anticlimax lol the first night i couldnt stop taking my temp cause i was sure i was going to become ill. The emergecy number they give you is a big reassurance you know that there is always someone there just incase. I hope everything goes well with yourself try not to worry andif you need a chat give me a shout take care",

      "Content": "Hi helsbels i have benn getting alot of aches aswell which i thought was just me but ive just had my first day of chemo last fri for 1 day and had no injections before hand. ( which makes me wonder if the same) it is strange as its like sore to the touch over my shoulders top of back ,across my chest and down top of arms but it all stoped in a line for a day or so nows its moving down my body, its just sore to the touch not when i move or anything. Is that the same as yours?? I dont want to bother the hotline number as i feel fine apart from that. I hope you feel better soon take care yvonne",
