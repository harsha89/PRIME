    "Content": "Hi deb, I\u2019m 28 and have triple negative breast cancer. 6cm tumour, no spread and I\u2019m not a carrier of the gene fault. When I was first diagnosed and even still some days I\u2019ve had horrendous back pain. Like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. Right across the middle. My bone scan was clear. My ct showed 2 lung spots but they could be anything and I had a bad chest infection earlier in the year so could be scarring. I was also a smoker prior to diagnosis. So don\u2019t worry! I know that\u2019s easier said than done. I figured mines is postural as even though your not aware your likely carrying yourself differently. Stay positive and carry on, don\u2019t let cancer win.
