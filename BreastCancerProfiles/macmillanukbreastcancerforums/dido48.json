      "Content": "Hello all, After 2 ops to remove a small Her2 positive tumour and surrounding tissue I had 4 cycles of AC therapy chemotherapy which affected me badly. That finished at the end of September last year. I then had 15 doses of radiotherapy and am now well into a year's worth of Herceptin. My question is about taste and dry mouth. My hair is growing back, very curly now, and I feel reasonably well although still tired a lot of the time but my taste is far from normal. My mouth is very dry still and struggle to lick an envelope, this is made worse by having a stuffy nose since I had a cold last October, and therefore breathing through my mouth. Obviously I use something to remedy this but I don't think it's a good idea to keep using them. Also my taste is still affected quite badly, mainly sweet things and bread based food. Difficult to describe but I suppose 'metallic' is the nearest description as well as a strange feeling in my mouth during and after eating these foods. Luckily, dinner type foods are fine, roast lamb for instance is a huge favourite of mine although I think my husband might be getting sick of it! Anyone else still got this type of after effect or any ideas if they will eventually go and if so, when? Thanks for taking the time to read this and for any comments you might offer.",

      "Content": "Hi Lindy. I hadn't really thought that it might be the Herceptin as no one has mentioned that, but you may be right. I'm beginning to think that the stuffy nose is related because it started around the same time as the Herceptin. I see my oncologist soon so I shall ask her. I also drink quite a lot but it doesn't cure the dryness, I have developed a need for butter mints from Marks and Spencer's, they certainly make it better for a little while. My hair has also come back very curly after being mostly straight since I was 5, I'm now 66! However I don't care what it's like as long as I have hair. Thanks again, Dido.",
