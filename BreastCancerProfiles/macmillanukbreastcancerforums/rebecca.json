      "Content": "Hi. This is my first post and I'm not really sure what to say, I just wanted to talk to other people in the same situation. I'm 41 and going in for a lumpectomy on Tuesday morning, I am already starting to panic. I have supportive family and friends but at times I feel so alone. The hospital has given me so much literature that I don't know where to start, there is so much to take in. At the moment it still doesn't feel real asI have only been for various appointments since being diagnosed, I have a feeling Tuesday will make it all very 'real' and that is making me very scared.",
