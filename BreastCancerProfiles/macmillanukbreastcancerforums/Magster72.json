      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. I had a mammogram in feb last year. These symptoms only started 10 days ago. Im thinking 2 weeks is too long to wait to be seen so going to phone and ask to speak to my gp on monday morning (she dosent work fridays) & hopefully she will she me sooner.Â  Im sorry to hear you received bad news & hope you are doing well with treatment etc. My cousin was diagnosed this time last year & think thats why im so anxious! Big hugs xx",
