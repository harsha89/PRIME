      "Content": "Thanks all. I've started with the good old Sudocrem. (Don't you just love that stuff, never been without it since having the kids!) but as it is spreading I may well visit the docs and see what they recommend as you did Kelly. It was almost burning in the night so will see if can nip this in the bud. Thanks again, Kirstie",

      "Content": "Hi all, Just coming out of the darkness following my third Taxotere on Friday last week. I've started to come out with a red blotchy rash on my cheek bones. Whilst it's a bit warm to touch I don't have a temperature. This is the first time I've had this, has anyone else had this and is it anything to be worried about? I know compared to some issues discussed on here this is so trivial but I'd really rather get answers from here than bother the BCN with such trivia! Thanks in advance, Kirstie",

      "Content": "I'm through my third Taxotere and have had 10 days of injections after each one. I too was very apprehensive at first. On the first day my friend came round who's a district nurse simply to tell me what on earth to do (mine go in to my tummy) . She advised and I did, then from then on, I've been fine doing them. A couple of suggestions, at first I found it easier looking in the mirror as I did it for some reason it felt easier that way, like it wasn't my tummy or something! Also a good bit of advice my friend gave was to change sides of your tummy each day too. Whilst chemo brain doesn't allow me to always remember which sides I injected into the day before (!) I'm sure it works out 'fair'! Once you've done it 3-4 times, itt becomes easy to do. I wish you all the best with it! Kirstie",
