    "Content": "Had my first tax on Friday and still struggling. Like you said it seems to be getting worse. Can't keep anything down, taste buds are fried so even water tastes rough, so no energy. Am meant to be going to work tomorrow as previously four days recovery has been enough... But now I'm not so sure. Would love to hear how you're getting on today.",
