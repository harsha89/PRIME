I'm so worried that when I stop antibiotics I will get an infection, I'm constantly checking my temp the other night it was 34 so I googled it an it said hypothermia. Before all of this I was laid back I've had a lump I'm my breast for a few yrs they said it will just be scar tissue from cyst they have kept draining in the same spot that turned our to be cancer so I now have no trust in what my hospital says and the stupid breast nurse there said its prob only been there 4wks which worried me more because it was 37mm in size.

The first wks are tough I kept thinking is it ok but surgeon said its fine my bcn was really nice and said baby steps everything will settle and it is starting to. I had infection in auxila where lymph nodes were removed but that is gone now. It all takes time just think you have been deconstructed and then reconstruction. Over time the swelling will get better and the implant will start to feel less hard, I am a 32g but my implant is about a. DD/E so still a big implant to get used to. I'm getting other breast reduced to match when implant is fully settled which surgeon said about Dec. Take things slow and time will make it better. I found antihistamines helped with swelling but remember there are lots of layers all storing tiny bits of fluid. Any questions please ask. Take care and rest. X",

I guess that's where the flap reconstruction is better but I'm to slim for one and even if I wasn't I think an extra scar area may be hard. I don't have a nipple anymore but my scar is in a T Shape like when you get an uplift because when he reduces the other side it will have the same scar line. My implant is a third smaller than my breast tissue he removed so I'm around a 32D or DD he thinks . ",

I was told no radio but chemo but like I've said I'm not keen if it's not going to make a huge difference have you tried nhs predict on line to see.

I had my first meeting with ornocologist today and he openly said chemo is over used in as many as 50% of cases who really will not benifit from it but feel if they do they are doing something. I'm in a grey area so for me until my dx test is done I'm opting out of chemo but having tamoxifen and possibly zolafex to shut down ovaries as 8/8 ER+ so very hormone fed.  X",

The nhs predict that I got told to look at shows chemo is only about 1.8% difference than not so I'm going to discuss it and see if maybe I could do radio to lymph nodes instead as I have not been told I need radio. My family has a history of heart conditions and I always have problems in surgery with my heart so this concerns me. Any treatment that is offered is your choice to take or not based on risks and benifits. I'm sure you will go through all of this and make an informed choice.  It's a lot to take in but time is on your side X ",

I didn't have enough fat for any other type of reconstruction unless they did it and still had implant. It does look quite real but a little wide due to swelling and that's why I have to wait for other boob to be reduced to get the best match.  Good luck with your choice I'm pleased with implant and no other body part scarring or healing.

I've been going for the past few yes with a lump and it's always been a cyst up til a couple of months ago when for some reason I went to different clinic and they found I have invasive lobular breast cancer which breast nurse told me has prob only been there 4wks. I've just had a mastectomy because they did an MRI and found another lump. I managed to keep this from my daughter vertical until I knew about surgery but when I told her she said she thought something was wrong. My diagnosis has made me loose trust in health professionals because I have found out lobular cancer doesn't show on mammogram but every time I went for tests they said its just a cyst but the last clinic said it was hiding behind cysts. If they had listened to me when I said each time you drain the cyst the lump is still there I might have saved my breast but you trust what they say. I'm sure the nurse is also wrong I can't see how a lump can be as big as 4cm in 4wks but then it not been urgent to remove it immediately. I hope you get a better outcome than me. X ",
