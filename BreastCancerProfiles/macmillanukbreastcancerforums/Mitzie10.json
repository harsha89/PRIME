    "Content": "Hopefully this post won\u2019t appear a dozen times, I have tried posting a reply a few times without success! I have never suffered from Hay fever but with the Chemo this time I was getting a watery eye, runny nose and a bit of a cough, kept feeling I was getting a cold but no temp. It came and went, just had Cycle 4 of FOLFIRI and my eyes started watering. My Chemo Nurse wondered if I was having a mild \u201callergic reaction\u201d no rash, obs stable. A lot of Chemo is plant based so she suggested I take an antihistamine. Magic, all settled down within an hour or two, just taking 1 a day for few days to see what happens Good luck",
