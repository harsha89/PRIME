Drink and drink and then some more if water tastes vile try different flavours of squash, your preference may change. Don't suffer side effects, tell the hospital or your GP and they will help. Please try to not worry and think of chemo as your friend. Very best wishes x",

I used the Paxman cold cap, my hair was thick, dark shoulder length, about half came out and I had patches particularly on the top of my head that were very thin, the cold cap is uncomfortable but only for me for the first 20 minutes, but everyone is different. The bit I struggled with which I did not know at the start is that hair can drop out at any point during treatment and for 3 weeks after the last chemo. Now the good bit my hair was in good condition throughout, it is now past shoulder length and thinner but looks good, I have coloured it twice and have very natural looking highlights from the chemo (it has white streaks) but with the colour kooks natural. It is your choice and your decision and a difficult one but I would do it for a 1% reduction in the risk. Very best wishes to you x Love",

Different medication is given for different chemo to try to decrease the potential side effects. So as well as taking oral anti-sickness tablets and steroids you will probably be given them IV. Metoclopramide is anti-sickness and I think DE is Dexamethazone although I have never seen it written like that before I had oral steroids to take the day before my last 3 cycles of Tax. All hospitals do things slightly differently all that really matters is that you are ok and if not contact them because they can and will help you. Best Wishes x  ",
