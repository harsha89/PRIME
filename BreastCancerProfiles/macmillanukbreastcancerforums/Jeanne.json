      "Content": "My mum died at 49 of breast cancer and 20 years ago I had cancer in my right breast. (I was just 40 too).  I was given a lumpectomy and radiotherapy. and Tamoxifen for 5 years (my consultant and oncologist disagreed over the time I should be on it, so I had to make the decision myself.). Then in 2009 I had it in my right breast, stage 2 this time and underwent chemo and radiotherapy (this was done in France as that is where I live now).  I was never offered a mastectomy and I am not sure, but I don't think personally I would have had it. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps I might have thought about it if it had been offered. I think it is a very personal decision.",

      "Content": "It may be a protective reaction. When I had cancer the first time I thought the what if I die scenario and you can push people that you care about away. You do see sense after a while and now I look on cancer like flu but its getting over the initial shock. Hope it all works out for you in the long term.",
