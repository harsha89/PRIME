I've only been on it for 4 months and suffering really badly I'm interested particularly with the ladies that have taken it for a year plus. How do you cope or do you just keep trying a brand until one suits ? I know the importance of the med but not sure how much pain to expect.. Take care Lou xxx",

It's a very scary and worrying time for all of us.. my op was delayed by 4 weeks because I was also diagnosed with angina at the same time I thought every ache and pain meant it had spread I started to have panic attacks and anxiety.. my mx was 1st Dec and I think I have come to terms with it all now. I'm starting back to work tomorrow im a manager of a preschool and really looking forward to working again with my lovely staff and children but feel a bit nervous... my advice to you would be take one day at a time and chose to do what is right for you. Good luck for Tuesday.  Lou",
