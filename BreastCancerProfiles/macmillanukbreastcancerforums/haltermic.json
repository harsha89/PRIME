    "Content": "Hi patsyk, Â  Maybe we can learn together? I have just joined and couldn't even find out how to ask my first question, so I saw yours and am now replying so that I can get an idea! Perhaps there is something in \"chemo brain\" because I was looking and looking for a box to click onto to start typing. I had read a fabulous post a few days ago and wanted to write to the person involved as I am experiencing exactly the same symptoms and problems and wanted a shoulder to lean on, but cannot even find that again today. Anyway how are you doing? are you a cancer patient or carer? I am post cancer having finished treatment in October. Maybe someone from the online community can tell us how to really get going on this site.",
