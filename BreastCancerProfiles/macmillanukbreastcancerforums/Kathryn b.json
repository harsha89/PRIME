      "Content": "Hi I had single mastectomy with immediate reconstruction DIEP 7 weeks ago. I would say at the five week mark I would definitely have been well enough to go on holiday. All being well I would imagine you will be pretty mobile but it will probably take it out of you if you overdo the walking etc.  A happy medium and you should be fine.  I am due to go away myself next week and am feeling pretty fit at the 7 week mark just quite a swollen tummy still. Everyone is of course though.  Also I guess every consultant gives  slightly differing advice.  I only had to wear my surgical stockings for 9 days total whereas I have to wear binder for 12 weeks on tummy.  Also advised not to drive 12 weeks. Let me know if you want any more info.  Kathryn x ",

      "Content": "Hi Helen so kind of you to post.  It is comforting to know you felt the same as me but are gradually feeling better.  I am so banking on not feeling like this after the Op.  I see you went out for a meal with your husband and girls.  How many daughters do you have.  Are they grown up? I have two grown up daughters myself.  Like you I enjoy walks and i did go out for a walk with my husband in the sunshine yesterday by the river in Cambridge which was nice.  I just can't cope with situations where I would normally be happy and joining in when my heart feels so heavy.  I think it is just such a shock when you are diagnosed. World literally rocked.  I am so pleased and encouraged to read your new boob is so good.  I am very pleased for you and it must make a huge difference to how you feel. I will be keeping everything crossed for your results please do let me know how you get on.  Three weeks seems a long time to wait.  Really kind and encouraging of you to tell me not to worry.  I will try not to. I think I have my head mostly around the surgery.  My main concern is coping mentally.  Your support and encouragement is so appreciated.  Please keep in touch.  Kathryn xx",

      "Content": "Hi Volvox167 thank you for your lovely encouraging message.  I am sorry I did not realise it was there before.  So kind  I am so pleased to hear you were pleased with results of diep flap.  Sad to hear how you felt about losing your hair though.  It must be devastating especially as it sounds like your long hair was especially beautiful.  The only consolation I can offer is that people I know who have lost their hair have had it grow back just as lovely as it was before.  I know you will have to be patient but there is light ast end of the tunnel. My Op is on 1st may. I am full of apprehension. I have never been in hospital except to have my now grown up children.  I can only take courage from the fabulous ladies on this site who have cheered me up and made me feel there is hope. Having said all that I am dreading how I might feel physically and emotionally post op and of course the pathology.  Take care and olease let me know how you are  getting on. Xx",

      "Content": "Hello all you lovely kind ladies on this thread. So nice of you to remember my surgery and send good wishes.  I had surgery on Tuesday.  As far as I know it went well although I am starting to appreciate the Diep surgery will take a bit of getting over.  However I suppose big progress already.  I am fairly mobile and able to wash myself albeit a wash at the sink as three drains still in.  Dying to wash my hair and a nurse said she will help me later.  Not a lot of pain but feel very tired.  Thank goodness radiator now turned off. I just need to be rid of drains and glam surgical tights now.  I have to say the staff at Addenbrookes Cambridge have been incredibly kind friendly and professional. A learning curve for me as I didn't know what to expect.  Have had a few tears for no particular reason but have been told it is normal.  Of course the pathology is starting to play on my mind now.  I have been told that with intermediate DCIS I am unlikely to need further treatment but I realise people's treatment plan can change.  In the meantime as far as the surgery is concerned from what I can tell the boob looks good.  Haven't seen tummy as all wrapped up and a bit of a stinging sensation from drain in abdomen but again this is normal and will go when drain removed.  I so hope all you ladies are coping ok at the mo and are able to enjoy the sun.  Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy B I am booked in for mastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction on 1st may.  I am full of emotion now and experiencing enormous sadness and anxiety which I sincerely hope does not last.  Anyway I admire you for staying strong as long as you have.  Obviously I am not out the other side of my Op yet but I can tell you that my BCN told me that post Op emotions often hit about day 3 and sometimes even  kind word can set you off.  I am sending you a big hug. We all have to go though so much.  Take care and so hope you feel a little better and stronger every day.  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Eddieboy how lovely of you to think of me.  Thank you.  I haven't felt too bad this morning but mostly I seem to feel like I can't socialise because I am not cheerful enough for mine or anyone else's sake.  I feel secretly sad and angry when I hear people cheerfully discussing normal stuff like I am in my own miserable little bubble.  I am pinning my hopes (perhaps a little too much) on feeling better emotionally post op and feeling like I can move on.  Having said that I know that I will be upset if the final pathology shows more than intermediate DCIS. I so hope you are having a good day  you have lifted my spirits getting in touch.  I hope Lucy-b and the other lovely ladies on this thread are also doing ok? 11 days until my Op Eek!!!",

      "Content": "Hi volvox167 Thank you so much for your kind wishes.  Only 7 hours to go to my surgery.  It is now 12 weeks since my recall to the breast unit.  Since then I have literally had times in the depths of despair.  I cannot find words to describe the shock of my diagnosis.  I had no idea! I have had so much to come to terms with.  Such a massive Op for a condition that they tell me might never progress to invasive BC but the doctors said this is only way to achieve good cosmetic result.  Your positivity and satisfaction with your own surgery really helps ado thank you very very much.  I am so sorry about your hair loss.  It must I am sure be incredibly devastating.  I don't know what stage you are at just now with your hair but as awful as it is your hair will grow back just as beautiful and you will get back to normality.  I have a friend who lost her hair to bc several years ago and she had the glossiest most beautiful long hair you could imagine.  Hang on in there! I will let you know how the Op goes. Hugs xxx",
