    "Content": "I also work in a school. I've been off work now since September on full pay. It depends on how long you have been employed for. I was getting full pay till December as I had been working in the school for 4 years (so 4 months full pay), now it is going down to 40% of pay, but Disability Workers Allowance should up your pay to be about the same - I think!! Your best bet would be to phone up the Pay Roll Department at the Local Authority where you work - they are brilliant at explaining things in lay-man terms. I also work Part-Time - 4 days a week. Good luck and stay strong - Chemo is shit - been there and done it - but it will soon be over. I had 5 months of Chemo every 3 weeks, then waited a month (or maybe just waited because it was the Christmas period!?!), then had 5 weeks of daily Radiotheraphy. Just felt tired all the time with the radiotheraphy. Maria xx",
