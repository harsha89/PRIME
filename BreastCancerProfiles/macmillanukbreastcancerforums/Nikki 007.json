      "Content": "Well exactly 1 year ago today I was told the news no one wants to hear.... \u2018you have cancer\u2019. Where has the time gone...? From an endless round of appointments/scans/surgery then radiotherapy the months flew by.  I count myself lucky that I got off quite lightly & didn\u2019t need chemo.  I\u2019d just like to wish all of you well in your ongoing treatment & for those, like me who\u2019s treatment has finished I hope you\u2019re not left with too many after affects.  I have an appt next week at the OAFU breast clinic then 2 weeks later my first mammogram since treatment so I\u2019m dreading that one! Hopefully I won\u2019t have to wait too long for the result.  Best wishes to you all Love Nikki x",

      "Content": "Hi Jax 0609, hope all goes well for you on Monday with the mammogram... I think the part I\u2019m dreading most is having my \u2018poorly boob\u2019 squished lol, let\u2019s hope results are quick for both of us. How are you getting on with Anastrazole? I bailed out after a couple of months as the side effects were dreadful. All the best N x",
