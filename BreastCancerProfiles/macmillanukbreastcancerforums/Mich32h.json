    "Content": "I was wondering if anyone has experienced a mastectomy when they already have implants in the healthy breast?  I have had implants in both breasts for 10 years. Im debating a mastectomy then implant in the breast where my cancer is but am worried sick that after surgery both breasts will look totally different in size and shape.  Can they do an uplift and resize of implant in the healthy breast at the same time as mastectomy with an implant in the other breast. Hope this makes sense.",
