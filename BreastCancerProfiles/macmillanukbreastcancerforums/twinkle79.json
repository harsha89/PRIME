      "Content": "Thank you for this. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s stretch mark or similar as I lost a lot of weight but put it back on again. Feel a bit like I\u2019m panicking about nothing as it was only after that Facebook post that I thought it could be something more.  Think I\u2019ll chatvit through with my partner before going to GP. Thank you so much for all your replies xxxx",
