      "Content": "Hi. I'm out of mind with worry - as I'm sure many more of you are. I'll try and keep the story short!  5 weeks ago I woke with breast pain in both and it continued for 2 days before I started to wonder why. I don't usually suffer from breast pain at all. I'm 39 and had mirena coil removed last November (it was in for 18months and messed my hormones about quite a bit). My mum had bc when she was 45 and eventually died aged 56 after bowel cancer. I found a smal red mark on my left breast which made me go and see gp. I left her to do the feeling about and she found a lump just under red patch on the inside of nipple. My left breast also felt warm and slightly bigger than the other side. She treated me with 2 types antibiotics for possible mastitis but referred me just to be on safe side. Appointment came through for one stop clinic but I had to wait almost 4 weeks which drove me insane. Antibiotics did seem to settle things down but still off and on had odd moments of mild pain and sometimes on both sides. Got to the point where I didn't know whether the feelings were pain or my mind going crazy. Anyway finally got to the appt last Monday - was initially told that it didn't feel suspicious and apparently the mammogram didn't show anything suspicious either. But I then had ultrasound and they were looking at things for ages until eventually the doctor came in and took 4 biopsies. No-one is sure what is going on and they did biopsies to give some answers and also due to my mum's history etc. Scared me half to death and said to come back in 10 days for results. My appt is this weds. I am convinced that the news will be bad and my husband is trying to be so positive. It's my 40th a week on Friday and I have all these plans which at the moment I really couldn't care less about. I have twin boys who are 9 and all I worry for is them.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply. And you did make me laugh when you said stop thinking you're on your way out! Yes, that's me being completely dramatic I'm afraid.... my husband tells me the same all the time. I'm so confused with the details of my mum at the moment as she did keep a lot from me to protect me. I was pregnant with the twins when she was going through the bowel cancer - it's all a bit of a fog. I don't think the two were related though. I will certainly report back either way on Wednesday.  Julie xxx",
