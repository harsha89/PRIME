    "Content": "Hi, Four months ago, after the second diagnosis of DCIS in less than a year, I underwent double mastectomy with implant reconstructon and had the sentinel lymph node removed. Pathology report said that the node was clear. Last week a I felt a lump under my armpit. I saw the surgeon and he said he believes it is a reactive lymph node. He gave me a referral for an ultrasound scan which I should do in the next few days. Did anyone have the same problem? Thank you",
