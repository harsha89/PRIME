      "Content": "Hi Ladies I am just over a week into my 7th Chemo out of 8, so feeling better (Always feel awful the first week) and counting down to the last one. I had an MRI after my 4th one and my 4 hungry tumours had shrunk by half so couldn't ask for better results so I'm hoping my final MRI will show they've gone. After this will be surgery, my question is, how long do they normally leave you between Chemo and Surgery? if its weeks, will they allow me to fly to Italy for a few days? I'm thinking sod it, have a break.... xx",

I thank heaven I had him and I hope you will come to think the same of your baby, by your side when you needed them, a true companion who you loved and gave a wonderful life to. As you know better than most, it will take time to come to terms with. All the best S X",

I won't lie, there are a few days when I don't feel well, but apart from that its the fatigue more than anything else.......everybody reacts differently, but I've yet to see a post where anyone didn't get themselves through it, you will be the same, you can do this! Just rest when you need to. For me now, the unknown is the mastectomy which I'm pretty scared about, but trying not to think about it till we get there. Keep your chin up. x",

I'll take one of those too please :-) I consider myself to be quite a laid back person, but the Chemo did frighten me, but once you get into the swing of it and know how your body is going to react you do get used to when you are going to feel good or bad.....and lets face it, nothing in life is as bad as you can imagine it to be.....just your last sentence tells me you'll do it no problem. x",

I was given Ranitidine by the hospital and it disappears really quickly so I would give them a call and ask for something better than over the counter. Good luck and have a fabulous Christmas. Sx",

Same again today but not as dramatic and still a normal movement....not sure whether to take a laxative just to pass it through a bit quicker? Any advice or anyone had something similar would be a great help?? xx  ",
