      "Content": "This is not meant to scare anyone it's just a reminder to check your boobies even if you've had a reconstruction. Know your bodies ladies and gents. My story:  In 2003 was 1st diagnosed with BC at 33 yrs old after finding a small lump. Turned out to be 3 tumours including a DCIS and considered Grade 2 with a spread to my lymph nodes. On 14th Feb 2003 I had a mastectomy with a diep tramflap reconstruction followed by chemo, zoladex, radiotherapy, and tamoxifen. In 2014 I found a tiny lump in my breast reconstruction which we all thought was going to be scar tissue but nope the BC was back. Thankfully it was tiny and was dealt with via a WLE and being put back on Tamoxifen. On 29th December 2017 I was given the shock news my BC is back. Again we thought it was scar tissue.  This time there's 3 tumours just to the left of my reconstruction pocket.  CT and MRI scans show I also have Secondary BC in a chest lymph node and in my right lung, albeit small. On 19th Feb I will be starting 6 cycles of chemo via docetaxel intravenous  and capecitabine tablets with a view to making it all go away. Fingers crossed it works",
