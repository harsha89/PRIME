    "Content": "Hi My wife's shortly to undergo a double mastectomy as part of her breast cancer treatment and is considering whether to have the under-pec implants with strattice reconstruction which sounds very similar to your situation. This is the only practical reconstruction approach available to her and if she has the reconstruction it would be as part of the same operation as the mastectomies, the alternative would be for her to have no reconstruction. She's struggling with the decision a bit at the moment. Her main reservation about the reconstruction is the impact it might have long term on her physical strength and particularly her strong swimming which she enjoys. She\u2019s been put in touch with another lady who has already had this treatment a few years ago but she isn\u2019t particularly active so wasn\u2019t able to advise as to her experience of the impact. It sounds like you're an active person, have you felt the reconstruction has hindered your arm strength or swimming or tennis ability from the pectoral muscle being affected? PS: apologies for cross-posting this on a different thread too.",
