      "Content": "Hi Everyone,  this is my first post to the online community.  I was diagnosed a couple of weeks ago and I'm due the first half (L breast first) of a double mastectomy on Tuesday. During my pre op appointment, the nurses said I need to buy a post surgery bra but I can't find any in my size.  I usually shop at Bravissimo because I have a tiny back and bigger boobs (more wide than big tbh!) and they stock my size.  Is there anyone of a similar size that can point me in the right direction?  I've checked M&S, Debenhams, Bravissimo and a few others that came up via Google. I'm 37 and have a little boy who is just about to turn five the day after my surgery.  It all happening a bit fast and some days are better than others. ",

I've never engaged with a forum before and have no idea of the lingo! I googled Belvia bras and bought one from Matalan yesterday. It was only £5 and they had them in pretty pastel shades. Hopefully it will be enough to see me through the first few days post surgery until I have a better idea of what I will find comfy and what the softie looks and wears like. Asda seems to get a lot of good reviews for their Belvia bras too although I didn't look at those. Thanks for your help x x x Sam",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone Just a little update.  I'm 6 days post surgery today and the Belvia bra from Matalan has been fabulous. I'm stepping in and out of it when I dress which makes it so much easier than going over the head.  I'm going to buy a couple more as they fit well under vest tops in this weather too and offer enough coverage to allow me to wear V neck vest tops without obviously looking like I've had surgery. Surgery went well.  I had a few complications with my blood pressure as I'm naturally low anyway and they couldn't get it to a safe level for a while so spent the first 24hrs very dizzy and woozy but the nursing care has been amazing.  Hoping my drain will come out today so I can stop looking like I'm carrying a bottle of wine everywhere I go with my drain in a bottle gift bag! Hope everyone is doing well. Sam x x x",

      "Content": "Hi Tinytears71 Thanks for the advice your post was very helpful.  I went to Matalan yesterday as you suggested and bought one of their  bras, it came in a S,M or L so the fit was more flexible so at least I have something to wear.  I only bought the one to try and thought post surgery I'll have a better idea of what i will feel comfortable with. When I spoke to the breast care nurses on Friday they said a good fitting bra helps with the healing (I have no idea how) so I'm keen to where one.  I like the idea of it keeping the drain in place too. I hope you're healing okay x Sam",

      "Content": "Hi Apologies for all my posts.  I couldn't work out how to send a group response and started to respond to everyone separately! I have now realised that it replies automatically in that way.  Lesson learnt! Thanks to everyone for their responses, there are some great ideas all round, things I hadn't even thought of.  I bought a Belvia style bra from Matalan yesterday but I've read lot's of positive reviews for the Asda ones too, I might look at those in the near future too.  Matalans came in pretty colours. I'm looking forward to my op on Tuesday, I know lot's of women feel a strong sense of loss towards their breast/s but I just want it gone. It gives me a lot of discomfort and that makes me worry and over anxious which I think is all normal and part of the emotional journey.  I'm hoping the discomfort will go once the breast tissue is removed. Today is my little boys school birthday party so I've got that to keep me busy. I really appreciate all of your help.  Sam XXXX ",

      "Content": "Hi Mel I'm okay considering.  Everything happens so quickly once that diagnosis is given that at first I felt I was playing catch up with my emotions but that seems to have settled now.  I'm still very nervous about the post surgery results. But I am desperately wanting my breast to be removed.  I have no attachment to it at all. My initial diagnosis is DCIS but I have a fairly large area 5x3cm showing on an MRI in my left boob.  I've had four biopsies that suggest DCIS but the area is so big the diagnosis may change and I may need other treatments. This forum has been very helpful and kind. I feel quite alone in this aspect of my life, in part I think because I'm a young (ish) mum and seeing all the other 'normal' mums on the playground is difficult, although it is getting easier. How are you now? Sam XXX",

      "Content": "Hi Bedford69, what a wonderful post. It's great that you're feeling able to go swimming.  Whilst I don't consider myself to be fit I do enjoy dipping in and out of running and swimming.  I can't wait to go swimming post op so good to hear it has been five weeks for you. Do you drive and how soon were you able to do this? I totally understand not having reconstruction.  I'm not 100% certain I will have it, if I'm honest if will be more for my husbands sake than mine! I should point out he is super lovely and has not once suggested I reconstruct even when I've told him that I don't think I will (but I secretly know he likes boobs lol).  I quite like the idea of running and riding my bike with no boobs to trouble me! I was watching the Olympic swimming the other day and the female swimmers appear to be very flat chested too so that gave me some confidence. I could just tell people I'm an avid swimmer! I think I will feel better once the breast is removed.  What are the vest tops you're wearing and where are they from? Good to hear from you, all the best with your new fitness regime. Sam XXX",
