      "Content": "To be honest, the thought of having a chemo free Christmas and New Year is the only thing that is keeping me going at the moment.  Having thought that I had got away with only one surgery, to suddenly have to have another and then yet another in 6 months is a bit hard to swallow. Many thanks for putting my mind at ease as there was always that niggle that I should be trying to feel up to having the chemo before really healing properly. Lets hope that we will be pleasantly surprised by the lack of side effects - my oncologist said that only 20% of people get side effects and then they dont all get all of them.  Made me feel a little better.

      "Content": "Has a mx, implant and lymph node clearance 3 weeks ago.  Still a bit sore, although probably mainly because I have been restricted doing exercises due to implant.  Scar under armpit has healed nicely.  Drain was left in for 9 days, however, removed and stitches removed at the same time.  Need to take care of arm from now on as more susceptible to infection but nothing to be worried about. They often have to cut through nerves to remove the lymph nodes and this may leave you with a numbness or pins and needles in the hand.  Feeling came back in my hand within 2 days and although I have the odd numb area on my arm, this does not cause a problem.  Odd twinge, but on the whole nothing desperate.

      "Content": "I have just had a mastectomy and reconstruction on my left breast  about 2 and a half weeks ago.  My breasts are quite small and have drooped with age (I am 59), however, the implant looks good in spite of the swelling that I have at the moment.  When it all settles down, I am sure they will match well, if not perfectly.  Naked, I think my left breast will be a little higher but with a bra on, it will not notice.  I did not see the point in getting both breasts done, as I had to have my lymph nodes removed and felt this was enough surgery at one time.  If the breasts do end up looking very odd, I may consider having the other breast done at a later stage Wendy xx",

      "Content": "I live in Spain, where residence does not qualify you for NHS, so we pay for private health. The hospital where I have had all the initial treatment, DX, MX, implant has been really good but like you have in the UK, there is nobody to really talk to.  Most of the nurses have a bit of English, but not enough to converse.  The consultants have good English and my surgeon was really nice and understanding (his wife had gone through the same), however, the plastic surgeon was arrogant and stand offish. My insurers have their contract for chemo with another hospital, so I have had to switch hospitals for the chemo. The first hospital used to get all the authorisations for treatment for me. This hospital leaves me to it. which just adds to all the stress. I start my chemo on the 13th and hope everything goes well as I don't have the luxury of a GP to go to and will have to refer back to the hospital for everything. I, like you, find myself in a bit of a lonely place. Had my pre-chemo tests yesterday - had no idea what to expect as they don't explain anything to you. My CAT scan with contrast which I thought would probably take about 15 minutes, in fact took well over an hour because I had to drink some fluid over the course of an hour I cannot fault the treatment or the accommodation, just the lack of support.  My friend who went through this last year and has good conversational Spanish, did her chemo 3 times before anyone told her that she should go straight to the ward for her blood test and not down to the lab.  She suffered having a canula inserted twice instead of only once. As they tend to assume that if you speak the language, you will know everything, I have taken the stance that I do not understand any Spanish, which has worked fairly well up to now. Do take advantage of your GP - they can also put you in touch with support. Do take advantage of the fact that you can use both NHS and private and take the best from both. Wendy xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, I have no experience of Tamoxifen, however, I do know that it is designed to remove oestrogen from the body. When I was diagnosed, I was taking HRT because I have no ovaries, so it was a complete oestrogen replacement.  I was told to stop and the result was the most horrendous hot flushes which caused sleepness nights together with bouts of depression resulting in floods of tears. Now my cancer has been found to be triple negative, I am back on HRT and all the above side effects are fading fast. Here is a link to the side effects of Tamoxifen http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Hormonaltherapies/Individualhormonaltherapies/Tamoxifen.aspx I don't think it is you, it is the hormones - understanding this, will hopefully help. I wish you well in overcoming these effects and hope you feel better soon. Wendy xx",
