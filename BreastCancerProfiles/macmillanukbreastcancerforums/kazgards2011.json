Stick it into Amazon, I know it is being sold there and hopefully you will have a crop of new hair that you are happy with in time for your holiday.   Karen xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Kiera It is difficult to know how you will feel after your MX. I didnt have particularly big boobs & having had a scare 18 months before my cancer was discovered (cyst on that ocassion) which made me really panic stricken at the thought of losing one of them, I was really surprised that when I was diagnosed it was a case of JUST GET RID OF IT!! One of the nurses back on the ward persuaded me to have a look at my scar the same day and although it was a shock, once I had seen it, at least that was done. I have had a prothesis since July 2010 and have only now got to the right place in my head where I am ready to go for reconstructive surgery. My prothesis has been brilliant and I have a seperate one for going swimming as well. You really would not know it wasnt real - but I guess having a 34b bust in the first place makes it pretty easy to get things looking as they did. My partner has been brilliant but it is now a case that I really long to have two breasts again - for me, not for anyone else. I am seeing the surgeon on 10th December and we will be agreeing the date in January for my op. Taking muscle from my back - best option for me apparently. So, new year, new boob! All I would say is give yourself plenty of time to get used to the situation, dont let anyone else 'persuade' you to do anything that doesnt feel right and in time you will find yourself in a place where you can either accept or take the plunge and go for reconstruction. Good luck with the op - will be thinking of you.   Karen xx  ",

Just like you I had some symptoms that terrified me in those first early months and I too was convinced that the cancer had returned. Thankfully it was never the case but your senses are naturally heightened and niggles that you would have ignored before joining the dreaded cancer club, now take on a life of their own. Speak to one of the nurses here or call your own Breast Care Nurse (mine as on speed dial for months!). We are all with you in spirit and know that road you are treading very well. You will get through it - its a phrase often used but do try and live one day at a time - in the moment - and you will feel better for it. I'm someone who multi tasks and does a very good white rabbit impersonation but if you are too, this is the time to step away from those old habits and look after yourself. Big hugs and keep posting and we will keep supporting you. Karen xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Eider I have also given up dairy products (including milk) and have almond milk as an alternative which is really nice. In fact, I would never go back to cow's milk now! I avoid red meat completely (never was that fussed) and eat chicken, turkey and loads of fish. I have been told about the rainbow diet by various people and it makes good sense to me. Lots of colours on your plate - and never a 'beige plate' - think finger buffet!! I have had one luxury since finishing treatement (MX, chemo and rad) and that is a personal trainer. When I came out of treatment I was about a stone underweight, weak and scared. I started with brisk walks 2 years ago and now do a full hour in the gym twice a week plus swim twice a week (that's not with the trainer by the way!). For me it is alll about taking back some of the control that cancer can rob you of. Statistically I have a better than even chance of a recurrance but I am at least doing my best to keep my body strong and by doing so I am not so stressed either - in fact I have days when I feel really happy and dare i say it, carefree - something that I never thought I would feel again. i am back at work full-time so I think I deserve my trainer and he is great, knowing my history. I will be having a few weeks off in the new year when I have my recon but I will be back with him as soon as I can post surgery. Love and hugs to all   Karen xx",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer in June 2010 so near to reaching the 5 year mark. The cancer was also in the majority of my lymph nodes on that side - all were taken out. My disease was not apparent in a mammogram, I just found a strange feeling lump. It was very frightening and now I have a yearly mammogram and see my consultant after that. I also see the oncologist separately as I will be on medication for at least 10 years due to the involvement of the lymph nodes. I am regularly checking my 'real' breast to ensure that I cant feel any further lumps and have to say, that an MRI has not been mentioned since my one and only after confirmation that it was cancer. I will mention this to my consultant when I next see him. I go privately as this is under my companies health cover so he might be more open to considering an MRI. Ironically, I feel just as nervous now as I did in the beginning because I know that lobular does have a habit of returning and I guess that I am higher risk than someone who hasn't had node involvement. It is never far from my mind.   Karen",

It didnt help that it was salt and pepper coloured - that was a shock and I have been having my hair highlighted since the year dot!. I kept wearing my wig for a few months as that was really nice and far better than what was sprouting out of my head. My hairdresser gave me some straightening serum to use on it but within an hour of painstakingly drying it straight when it was long enough to do so, it went back to crinkle mode. About 8 months after chemo the fizz started to go and I am now back to my usual fine mop that refuses to be styled for any length of time! I am now taking Anastrozole and I see that one of the side effects is thinning of hair - GREAT - just what i dont need with fine hair already...now where did I put that wig :) Love to all   Karen xx",

      "Content": "Hi Rachael and everyone following this post. I was peri menopausal when I was diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer in June 2010. Going through FEC-T propelled me through to post menopause at the speed of light but my oncologist still kept me on Tamoxifen for 2 years. I seem to have got away lightly in that I did have some joint pain initially but this died down after a few weeks and all was then fine. Had blood test in Oct which showed me as being substantially post menapausal (I didnt need a blood test to tell me that!) and am now taking Anastrozol which is giving me some aches but I am keeping up the exercise and healthy eating as i do believe that this has a part to play in how our bodies adapt to the drugs ongoing. Everyone is different but the bottome line is that this is another shield to keep the bloody thing from coming back so unless it is making your life downright miserable, I say 'keep taking the tablets'!

There are some schools of thought that say soya can mimic oestragon (?) anyway, as I hadnt been using soya products beforehand I switched to almond milk and dropped dairy products completely.

My consultant told me that I had to wait 3 months before I could go swimming - but that might just be me and so it is always a case of asking your doctor. I have a swimming prothesis and although I was sure everyone was staring at me the first time I went for my lesson, I soon realised that no one but me was bothered and now I dont even think about it. I work full-time again but still go swimming at least twice a week and actually swim properly, which is so much better and I'm sure much more beneficial. I also got myself a personal trainer right after I finished rads and with her help gradually built up my strengh and my body. I'm one of those people who stop eating when they are stressed so I was a good stone underweight by the end of rads but having a trainer who could also advise me about the best way to build myself up was a godsend. I certainly wouldnt have shown my face in the gym without her as I was previously totally intimated by the gym culture. I did the Race for Life last year with some friends from work and as my employer matched our sponsorship money, we raised over a £1000. It was one of the best feelings I have ever experienced to run over that finish line hand in hand with my friend. The atmosphere at these events is amazing and even if you just amble around at your own walking pace, it is a fantastic thing to do. I've said I will do it again this year and even though I am not a keen runner, I am really looking forward to it. Love to you all Karen xx",

      "Content": "Hi all So, 2 weeks ago today I had a latissimus dorsi flap and right breast reconstruction nearly two and a half years after a MX. This involved 6 hours of surgery and a new 'mound' where my old boob was. As expected I felt like I had been kicked by a horse but nothing that my consultant hadnt warned me about. I went home after 5 days with one drain in and it is still there as my body is stubbornly refusing to drop to the magic 50ml mark at which it can be removed. I should be jumping for joy but instead I feel low and tearful. This 'mound' doesnt yet feel like it belongs to me and I keep getting feelings of deja vou from when I had BC and all the treatment that followed. What the hell is wrong with me? Is this normal? At my lowest point I think that I have made a big mistake by having the recon as I was fit and healthy before - just missing one boob. I know that the stats say that there is no evidence of recon surgery raising the risk of a recurrance but it doesnt stop me worrying. I feel a fraud and a loser for feeling this way. Just wanted to know if there is anyone else out there who has had a recon and felt like I currently do. It would certainly help to know that I am not a freakish one off! Love to all Karen xx ",

The thought orf having to have further surgery to even things up fills me with horror at the moment but so did having a recon for nearly 2 years post MX! As you say, it is all about giving things time - both emotionally and physically. I did join a brilliant 'Moving On' group run by FORCE (local cancer charity) and regularly meet up with the friends that I made there. The group was made up of people who had suffered various cancers but no one had been through an MX so it is not a subject that I can discuss in detail with them.

I am reading lots of discussions about getting towards the end of treatment and for me, that was one of the hardest times to deal with. I was very lucky to have an excellent cancer charity attached to my local hospital and was invited along with my partner to join their very first 'Moving On' group. We met every 3 weeks on a Weds morning to talk through our experiences, get some great information from key people in the oncology dept and basically support each other as the safety net of appointments & checkups was gradually taken away. We all agreed that one of the best papers we ever read on how it feels to be emerging back into the real world after treatment is by a guy called Dr Peter Harvey who is a Clinical Psychologist. I must have read this more than 50 times when the panic and fear of 'what if' hit me and it is absolutely a beacon of calm and reassurance. I have put the link to the paper below. Would be interested to hear what others think, http://www.cancercounselling.org.uk/northsouth/extra4.nsf/WebResClient/1761049276601BD68025735B00604834/$FILE/article3.pdf?openElement Love to all Karen xx",
