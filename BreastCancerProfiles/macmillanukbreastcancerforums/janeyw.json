      "Content": "Hi Caryn - thanks for the reply. I am fast learning that so many others are in similar situations which really helps. I think following chemo, it will be surgery (whatever that may be ) and radiation for me too. How do you feel about the full node clearance? I wish they could only take another few out rather than most of them ...... but perhaps its for the best? Hope all continues to go well. Oh yes I am tasting a metallic taste and waves of sickness - but the anti sickness tablets are helping. Jane xxx",

How positive you are about your MX and using prothesis - can't get my head around that if that is the outcome I really admire you and so many others! How have you coped with your nodes removed - any problems? My children too think I look younger with my shorter hair!! Thanks again Jane xx",

      "Content": "I am a young 46 year old with two teenage daughters, busy Director who never thought this would happen to me!!! After a train crash crazy emotional 4 weeks I started my first FEC chemo yesterday and used the cold cap. I have a lump right under my nipple which I am told is a very difficult position and more than likely with need a mast. It was such a shock as I could not feel the lump, no other signs only a cyst which was drained and told everything was fine. But after draining the cyst they found the dreaded lump - thank god the radiographer decided to do a lets just check again scan........ The MRI showed that there was no signs that it had spread to my lymph nodes - phew but had a SNB and two nodes were removed. My consultant said the nodes looked healthy so he was sure had not spread ... but as I am fast learning nothing is certain and it had spread to one of the two nodes. I was devastated this was my only positive - I lead an active life fly regularly run 3 miles every day - more lymph nodes removed scares me and have read how you need to be so careful with exercise etc etc. If it is only one of the two nodes where cancer was detected why do I now need to have more removed? I know its just in case. Anyway decisions for the future so now full steam ahead with the chemo. The hope now is to shrink the lump (its about 2-3cm) so that the surgeon can try to perform a lumpectomy but it will be tricky and my oncologist is all for the mast route so its only my surgeon who is trying to conserve my lovely breast!! Anyway my first chemo went ok yesterday - now keen to see the red fluid killing the cancer!! Used the cold cap and it really wasn't that bad so will continue for as long as it stays not too bad. If anyone has / is going through a similar roller coaster would love to hear. Especially my future decisions regarding further lymph node removal / anyone else with a tricky lump placement / any advice on what will happen to my hair loss / or any other general insight into this rather scary scary time. If I feel ok after this session will this be the pattern for the future? I think my onc said she will probably switch 2 FEC then to something else? Lool forward to any replies.",

      "Content": "Hi Mary. Thanks great you seem so positive - I need to work on being positive. I know I need to make the right decisions but its all so much to take in. If only one node was positive then why should I have the rest removed - and won't the chemo do its job and kill the cancer!! So much to take in - I will probably agree to the nodes being removed it does seem the most sensible approach - but chemo first! I really feed for you to have cancer come back after 14 years - that seems so unfair. The roller coaster ride is awful. Glad you too want to feel feminine thats my main concern if surgery ends up being a MX - can't get my head around that. Thanks again. Jane",
