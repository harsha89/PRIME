There is a lot you can do though, depends on how much time you have as you're looking after hubby too. How much support does she have at home? For things like shopping, laundry etc? As energy is at a premium during chemo. Pampering type things - side effects include dry skin and brittle nails. Often just some company, someone to listen. My hubby is really introverted, so I struggled for that. Getting out if she's signed off work - coffee and cake, an amble through the park. Stuff to do while sitting at the hospital - puzzles, reading material. Funny hats was my thing - a wig wasn't for me. Hugs. Lots of them. Like this one for you!! What cancer does your hubby have? Ignore me if I'm too nosy - but just thought you might like some links to other areas of the site if you haven't looked around already. And do look after yourself, please!! xx",

There is every chance it's nothing, but getting it checked now will mean catching it early if it is something. Breast cancer is very treatable these days. Not a pleasant journey, but all doable. If it's nothing, then you will get peace of mind knowing you've had it checked. Don't let them fob you off either, especially as you have family history. Please also come back and let us know how you get on. And lastly, a great big hug, as I'm sure you need a few of those!! xx",

I had grade 3 invasive, and my surgeon thought he could do a lumpectomy after chemo. It did shrink, but not THAT much!!! But I still had to pretty much keep insisting I wanted mx. He eventually agreed, after looking at the scan again. I'm now nearly 2 years post surgery, and the implant recon is barely noticeable. And that only by me. They will usually not agree to removing a healthy breast though. There are a couple of ladies here who managed to get it done, but they had to go through psych assessment and all sorts. Can be done.

My employer and colleagues are incredibly supportive, and I've been honest about what I can and can't do. I still get out on the road and service alarms, just not as many and not every day. There are no ladders on my van so I'm not tempted to try and use them, the lads come and do that stuff if it's needed. I'm open with the customers, and they have been pretty supportive also. Some even call the office from time to time to see how I'm doing! And there is plenty of paperwork I can do at home on the bad days.",

I had acid reflux instead! The fatigue I remember well!! Tax was easier in a lot of ways. I wasn't fighting constipation which was a definite plus. The side effects didn't kick in until day 3/4. Had it wed and crashed fri night. The bone and joint aches were the worst. Also had dizzy faint spells on the sat. Keep on top of the pain meds!! By the mon I was ok ish and back at work.  The steroid dose is much higher for Tax, so the crash is harder. The bad taste and yucky mouth was worse. And the fatigue. I was having to stop and rest during the day so I didn't fall asleep at the wheel! On the plus side - I competed at the Southern Counties Archery Champs 3 1/2 weeks after finishing chemo, took a bronze in the champs and shot the 4th highest score in the team round after.  So it's doable. Pace yourself, and stay on top of pain meds. Hugs xx",

As you were TN, they will be low. However, unless they were actually zero, there will always be an element of risk with the pill. I went through my GP, who was very understanding, and he wrote to my oncologist who recommended a specific type of hrt for me. I'm sure others will be along who are using other types of contraceptive, such as the coil. Just a heads up though. They never get ALL of the breast tissue with a mastectomy. There will always be some left. So do be vigilant to any changes in your scars etc. Hope that helps xx",

Not everyone gets bad side effects (most manage ok, but don't post because they don't need to), and very few get all the side effects going.

I had lymph node involvement and a 40mm x 30mm lump, with assorted other calcifications. Chemo was 3xEC and 4xT finished in Feb, then left mx and node clearance with immediate implant. They got clear margins and saved the nipple - not that I can feel it, which is a pain when it itches..... I had 15 RT in May, and had 12/18 Herceptin today. As far as I know I'm cancer free, just mopping up any strays with H. Also getting bone strengthening infusion every 6 months as I'm now post menopause. While it wasn't much fun, I did manage to work through chemo (I'd have gone nuts staying home!!) and had 2 weeks off for surgery. RT was harder, as it's so intense going in every day. It's doable. One minute at a time some days though! Hugs to both of you xx",

That said, delaying chemo any further is probably not the best plan. It is doable. I worked all the way through chemo. We all get SOME of the side effects, but very few get ALL of them. And there are meds for most of them. I was too young for mammograms, and by the time I found a lump it was in the nodes. But they did get all of it. I had chemo before surgery. It is possible to delay one or two of the cycles by a week. I delayed one myself due to work commitments, and another was delayed due to low bloods. My work involves going into people's houses. Where there were kids with infections. Businesses, where there were people with infections. If you are careful with hygiene and use hand gel at all times, and avoid getting too close to outsiders with infections, you should be able to manage it. I never picked up one. Had a couple of colds, but nothing that delayed chemo. Christmas was a washout for me last year - I had chemo that week and was on my crap weekend for Christmas. Hubby cooked, I couldn't eat much of it. He was emotional, worrying it would be our last one. We managed. Our families are both in South Africa. So no physical support. We managed. Talk to the kids - they cope better than we think they will. But they will react to our worrying. Be honest, they can tell a half truth better than we can. Trust the girls to step up - they may surprise you. 5 or 6 months of crap. Yes, it's not pleasant. But it passes. Surely it's worth it, to hopefully get a lot more years? I'm sure you could use a few hugs - so here's one to start you off. xx",

      "Content": "Hiya. Sorry you find yourself here, but welcome, and we will try to answer your questions whenever you have them. I'm sure other more knowledgeable folk will be along soon, but in the meanwhile ..... I can't answer the lobular bit, but invasive means it has grown outside the lobes. ER8 - oestrogen strongly positive, PR7 - same for progesterone. That means you will have to take Tamoxifen or similar after surgery. HER2 is a genetic abnormality which causes cells to overmultiply. Not the hereditary one. If that is negative, then you may escape chemo if there is no lymph node involvement. If it is positive then you get chemo and Herceptin which is a targeted biological therapy for HER2+. I had Invasive Ductal, ER0 PR0 HER2+ with lymph node involvement. So I had 7x chemo, mastectomy and full node clearance, currently having radiotherapy and still on Herceptin till December. It is tough, but it is doable. Breast cancer in general is very treatable these days, so try not to worry too much. Once they have all your results back they will give you a plan. They do do some further scans sometimes, just to check they've got it right. Please stay in touch on here, and offload or ask questions as much as you need to. Good luck xx",

      "Content": "Hi JoDec There's quite a few of us who had chemo first. Two reasons they do it that way - the first is to shrink the lump enough to make a lumpectomy possible, and the second is when it's an aggressive form like I had (HER2+ Grade 3) with spread to lymph nodes they want to hammer it as quickly as possible. I was diagnosed 20 Sep and first chemo was 12 Oct, and I had contrast CT and bone scan in between. So it all happened pretty quickly. Have you had a look at the monthly Chemo Club yet? You can find the August one here, and there will be folks at about the same stage as you to help each other through, There is a link on the first page to a blog with tips and advice. All the waiting is wearing isn't it? Once you get going you will feel better mentally. Use the time to get stuff done you might not have the energy for while on chemo. Like a spring clean, freezer meals and so on. Which will keep you busy and your mind away from worrying for a while. Chemo isn't a lot of fun, but it is doable. Some days it's one minute at a time. You've got this. Hugs xx",

I had immediate implant (of the permanent silicone variety), which was on top of the muscle and using a strattice support. I can feel the edges of the implant, and some slight capsulation from RT, but if you didn't know you wouldn't be able to see it. So it's worth a try. Have you tried physio? If you can find one who is has training in kinesiology as well? Mine was brilliant, came up with exercises not only for recovery, but also to help me get back onto the archery field. One last question. Have they done a scan to see what is going on? Hug?",

First thing to do is................. breathe. Yes, you could still get the all clear, and we hope that will be the case. There are a number of ladies here who have several markers in their breasts. It's there for 2 possible reasons. One is to show the surgeon where the lump is during surgery. The other is, if it is benign then they will know on future scans that it is not a new one. Should you get bad news, then please remember that breast cancer is very treatable these days, with well over 90% of women going on to full lives. And there are new treatments coming to the table all the time. And it does sound like you've found it early. The waiting is going to do your head in. Possibly the worst part of this. So try to keep busy doing stuff you enjoy, and please try not to worry too much - although I know you will anyway. Please don't be tempted to ask Dr Google - he is mostly out of date and just plain evil. Stick to recognised sites like this one, CRUK and so on. May I also say - well done losing so much weight!! It's really hard to do, and may have saved your life in more ways than one!! There are always plenty of hugs to be had around here, and I'm sure you can use a few!! xx",

      "Content": "Hi volvox167  Welcome to the community. Sounds like you need a few hugs, so here you go. Your fears have resonated with me. A year ago I was wondering the same things. I install and service intruder alarms, so very physical. I am also an archer, and was knocking on the door of county team when I was diagnosed. I decided on immediate implant reconstruction, as I didn't want a long recovery time or depletion of my back muscles. (Similar muscle use to rowing I think). I already knew I had lymph involvement at the start. So it was a one stop shop surgery wise - all off and out. Mine was HER2+, so I had chemo first. I was offered a PICC line, but would not have been able to shoot. They accommodated me and I had a Portacath, which is all internal, and after a week there was no restriction on what I could do. Unfortunately I missed the Indoor Nationals as I had chemo 4 days before, and there was no way I could do it. I did work all the way through chemo, on light (ish) duties. I managed to shoot near to my best scores at the Southern Counties Champs 3 1/2 weeks after finishing chemo, and took a bronze.  I had 2 weeks off work after surgery, but no shooting for 6 weeks, to let the internal stitching heal. I had full mobility in 10 days (once the drains were out). Unfortunately I was unlucky, and now have chemo induced heart failure. With the accompanying low energy levels. But the meds are doing their thing, and I'm getting back out on the field again. It is all doable. Not always easy. You do have to pace yourself, and be kind to yourself. I think, for me, continuing to work and shoot helped me mentally and emotionally to cope with treatment. SOME things HAD to stay normal, or I would have gone nuts!! Sorry for the long post, I just wanted reassure you that many women get through this without most of the ghastly side effects. Those who post on here are those who did suffer, not those who didn't. We all get some SE, but very few get all of them. Your physical fitness will be of enormous benefit to you. And the peak condition of your shoulder muscles will aid your recovery from surgery. You've got this. And we've got you. More hugs xx",

My drains were in for 10 days, and I know some on here have had them for longer. I never had any dressings. Once the butterfly strips came off I was told to keep it open!! If you have had a reaction to the dressings, ask for some different ones. Mepilex is the anti allergenic one I think. I can't help with the clear margins thing, as I had a mastectomy. Make sure you keep up with the exercises - VERY important. Leave any above shoulder ones until the drains are out, but keep doing the others 3x a day. This is so you have the mobility in your shoulder for radiotherapy (and beyond!!) Most of all, be kind to yourself - your body has been through a lot. xx",

My drains were in for 10 days, and I know some on here have had them for longer. I never had any dressings. Once the butterfly strips came off I was told to keep it open!! If you have had a reaction to the dressings, ask for some different ones. Mepilex is the anti allergenic one I think. I can't help with the clear margins thing, as I had a mastectomy. Make sure you keep up with the exercises - VERY important. Leave any above shoulder ones until the drains are out, but keep doing the others 3x a day. This is so you have the mobility in your shoulder for radiotherapy (and beyond!!) Most of all, be kind to yourself - your body has been through a lot. xx",

And they never mentioned RT until after my surgery (I had chemo first). I really didn't want it. Oncologist told me they really needed to zap the level 3 nodes and my chest wall. HER2 is a sneaky bugger, and they didn't want to take any chances. It was quick. But intense and tiring as I was working full time. They gave me time to move back to vertical slowly, so I didn't throw up. The collarbone survived. I'm still here and plan to be for some time yet. It's easier than chemo. It's not worth skipping it. xx",

      "Content": "Hi monicanatura A warm welcome to the community - the club none of us particularly wanted to join. That sounds pretty confusing for you. A change from DCIS to Invasive is not uncommon, and there may be a terminology issue there. DCIS is Ductal Carcinoma in Situ - in other words contained within the milk ducts. When it grows through the duct wall, it becomes invasive or IDC. Inflammatory is a whole other thing though, so good that you're getting a second opinion on that. HER2+ is a genetic disorder, where the HER2 receptors start growing wildly. Not hereditary, they don't know why. This can be a factor in all types of breast cancer, the same as hormone receptors (ER/PR). The results for HER2 can often take longer than the others, which is why the dx can change. Mine did. I was originally triple negative, then the HER2 results came back weakly positive. I hope that is all about as clear as mud It sounds like the inflammatory bit is the outlier here, which the new oncologist will be able to clear up for you. It sounds like chemo is doing it's thing for you. Mine shrunk by about half on EC chemo. I guess you're in need of a hug or two, so here you go.",

I've always eaten relatively healthily, just never enough really. If I'm busy I forget to eat, if I'm not hungry or tired I just can't be bothered. So between my coach being on my case all the time :) and now the BC, I'm eating a lot more. I'm finding milk is about the only thing that tastes right to drink, so drinking that in the evenings. By then I'm fed up with how my tea tastes. Stopped HRT before DX, so the extra calcium is probably good. Used to have an alcohol problem a few years ago, but hardly drink these days. A whiskey occasionally, mulled wine is good Finding I have more of a sweet tooth these days. I read that the filgrastim affects blood sugar, maybe that's why. I do think physical activity is the biggie. Hubby's grandad died of old age in his nineties, smoked, drank, strong black coffee red meat etc all his life. But he worked hard outdoors all his life. As one friend put it - a healthy lifestyle is merely the slowest possible way to die. And even that doesn't seem to be true anymore. I drive 25 000 miles a year. Statistically I'm more likely to die in a road accident than from this cancer. So, all in balance. We still need to enjoy life!!",

It's likely to be 2 weeks.  It's impossible not to worry, but try to keep busy and take you mind off it if you can. Some would say worrying won't change it, but unfortunately it's hard to stop your thoughts going off on all sorts of tangents. You do have a awful lot on your plate right now. I'm going to tag WORRIED2016 - she may be able to offer some support/advice as she was in a similar situation with her dad.  If you are really struggling, perhaps the helpline might be useful : 0808 808 00 00 Mon-Fri 9am-8pm, you would be able to talk to someone in real time. Most of all, please be kind to yourself while you're waiting.  Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Ok, let's see if I can get this right. The contrast CT is looking for things in the lymphatic system. Or, at a slightly different frequency of scan, can also be used to look for blood clots in the blood vessels. It is not used to look for cancer in the bones usually - the contrast is taken up in the fluid transport systems in the body. The MRI I'm not that familiar with, but I think it's similar. There's also the PET scan. I think these can see things in the bones, on the right settings. I think they can also see stuff in the tissues. The nuclear bone scan will find any damaged areas in the bones. Mine caused a sharp intake of breath when it got to my knees - a 30 year old sports injury!! The nuclear stuff is taken into the bones, but takes longer - hence the 3 hour wait before the scan. I'm sure Dreamthief will be along at some point to clarify if I've missed anything. Hope that helps xx",

Unfortunately the pathology does sometimes change after surgery, once they have got the whole thing under the microscope so to speak. However it's not the norm. Try not to cross any bridges you haven't got to yet!! The waiting is hard, so try to stay busy. Well, as busy as you can after the surgery! How are you doing with the exercises? Please make sure you keep up with them, so that you get mobility back. You will need that for radiotherapy. You've had the mx, and I assume the lymph nodes checked as well. So the cancer is gone. All that's left is to mop up the strays. As you are HER2++ you will have to have chemo so that you can get Herceptin, which is a biological therapy that targets the HER2 cells. The prognosis for HER2+ has improved enormously since Herceptin became available, so please don't listen to Dr Google as he is out of date. Also you will have Tamoxifen (or AI's if you are post menopause). As you are ER8, they will be of massive benefit to you. You've got this!! One day at a time. Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi Laurajane779  Welcome to the community.  How is your Mum recovering from her surgery? Well, I hope. She needs to make sure she does the exercises they should have given her. Very important for regaining shoulder mobility.  Mine was HER2+, so I had to have chemo in order to get the targeted drug Herceptin, which your Mum won't need. She may still need chemo though, due to the node involvement. They make that decision based on how many nodes, which is why they are waiting for those results before giving a treatment plan. Her age may play a part in the decision too. She will definitely be given an aromatase inhibitor (AI) such as letrozole. For ER/PR positive BC this is the main defence for the future, and very effective. Chemo isn't pleasant. But it is doable. The drugs on offer for side effects are very good these days. Please remember that she has had the surgery. So the cancer is gone. Everything else is either to mop up stray cells or to prevent recurrence. Please keep us posted, and feel free to ask any questions you may have. Or just have a good rant if you need to.  Would your Mum be comfortable joining us here? And here's a big hug for a lovely daughter!! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Tigha Welcome to the community - not that any of us wanted to be here, but it's a good place to get support and, very importantly, hugs. Lots of them!! Ok, first - breathe!! Diet. If we avoided the stuff they say is bad we'd not eat anything. Or breathe for that matter!! There are as many opinions as there are people. The best advice I can give you is - eat varied and balanced. What is right for one isn't necessarily right for another. If I had a pound for everyone who told me to eat kale............... I hate the bl00dy stuff!! I lived on milk during chemo because it was the only liquid that tasted right. Dairy is less of a problem in this country anyway, as organic cows don't get given hormones. Soy is the same - it's plant oestrogens. My understanding is the plant ones are actually ok, but I stand to be corrected. You need to keep your immune system up. But more importantly, you need fuel to fight the disease. During treatment it's a matter of eating what you can when you can. You also need to try to avoid stress!! So if it's stressing you out, put it to one side, and eat what you normally do. Google can be quite evil at times, so try to stay on decent sites like this one. There is so much info out there, claims for \"alternative\" therapies and so on, and little of it has a foundation of solid research. They don't actually know what causes most types of cancer.  Be kind to yourself above all. It is tiring, so take whatever help is offered.  Oh, and hydration, hydration, hydration. Here's one of those hugs I mentioned. I'm sure some of the others will be along soon to offer more!! xx",

The most important things. Firstly, do the exercises. Up to shoulder height until the drain is out, then all of them. And keep doing them. My mx/fnc was in March, and I still stiffen up if I don't stretch. Be kind to yourself. It's a longer anaesthetic, and you will likely feel pretty crap for a couple of weeks.  It takes about 6 weeks for all the internal stitching to heal. After that, try to get back to what you were doing as quickly as you are comfortable doing it. Your arm and shoulder are used to certain things. They need to be allowed to continue to do those things. For me, it was installing burglar alarms and shooting arrows. My physio cleared me to start working up to 6-8kg weights after 6 weeks. Your upper inner arm will feel like you're rubbing sandpaper on it for up to 12 weeks. It will be numb for longer. Mine is ok now, but armpit still numb and likely to stay that way. The nerves sorting themselves out is like shooting pains. They come and go, and diminish over time. I rarely get them now. If they don't give you a bag for the drain, then sort out a shoulder bag let down to waist height. To carry the drain in. It won't come out if you forget and drag it behind you, but it hurts!! I went out and about with the drains, and even drove myself to the hospital to get the second one out. 10 days after surgery. Some ladies used a v-shaped pillow to rest the arm on for sleeping. I just lay on the other side with my arm over a pillow. My usual sleeping position. You've got this. And if you do struggle with pain, don't keep quiet. She who shouts loudest gets the best pain relief!! Hug? xx",

Whether my Mirtazapine has helped any is debatable, but I'm not coming off them to find out!! Lady magnet has worked for some - sticks on your underwear I believe. Then there's the herbal route. Evening primrose oil etc. As you are ER+, do be careful as some of these supplements have oestrogen in them. I'm in my second menopause now, after being on HRT for 10 years. No oestrogen killers for me though as I was ER neg. So HRT wasn't to blame. It's annoying, especially at night as you say, but I've got used to it for the most part. I dread summer though....

I am AA cup, so not much to have a lump cut out of - I was insistent on mx and implant right from the get go. Surgeon started wittering about lumpectomy after chemo, but lump was still over 2cm!! I just refused anything and everything else until he agreed. I didn't want long surgery/recovery, but neither did I want to be lopsided - I have a thing about symmetry. Fingers crossed they get it all next week. But there are options if they don't. And even if they do, you should be able to get balancing surgery later if you want it.

It sounds like she will be getting Paclitaxel chemo which is the weekly Taxane. Most of us had the 3-weekly one Docetaxol. The weekly one is easier on the system as it's a much lower dose. That said, she will be tired, and probably have some pretty achy joints and muscles. As to her other condition, that is one for the medical staff. If I'm not mistaken, she will likely have low iron and VitB12 because of it, so those will need to be monitored on her pre-chemo bloods each week. Would your mum consider joining in here?  You could also look at the July Chemo Club, there are a lot of tips and tricks there which may be helpful. And also folks at around the same stage of treatment. She could also contact the MacMillan helpline, where there are a lot of really good people to talk to about stuff. They can help with all kinds of things, not just someone to talk to. Things like financial support and so on. 0808 808 00 00 Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm. Lastly, you need support too. Please feel free to talk on here when you need to, ask questions, or just vent!! Hugs xx",

If you are not yet below 50%, your Herceptin will continue. If it is too low, they will give the heart meds a couple of months to do their thing, and then restart Herceptin. Have you had 4 or 6 to date? I only had 12 Herceptin. I will not be getting any more, as I ended up with chemo induced heart failure. The heart meds as above together with statins and aspirin have improved my heart function, but I decided not to restart H. There is good evidence that 9 is actually sufficient. Please try not to panic. The heart meds are good, and they work. And the damage from Herceptin is reversible, so they will balance it out for you. Hug? xx",

Buy silly stuff, useful stuff, try to have a bit of a laugh. Do NORMAL stuff. She will be a little quiet, it takes time for everything to sink in. But try to treat her the same as usual - we like to have a bit of normality in our lives. Time enough for the crap later. PLEASE stay away from Dr Google - he is very out of date and sometimes (as you've discovered) just plain evil. Stick to recognised sites like this one, CRUK and so on. And avoid American sites as they tend to be quite negative. BC treatment has moved on, and success rates are very high these days. They do a lot of tests and scans up front. This is so they have a very good picture and can set up a treatment plan that is quite personalised. So please try not to worry too much about that side of things. Grade 2 is intermediate aggressiveness, so it won't be growing very quickly. ER8 is good, very responsive to hormone blocker treatments. Spring clean the house so there's less to do during treatment? It helps to keep busy. Massive hugs to both of you xx",

Second, once you've had the surgery, the grade is not that important. And chemo will mop up any strays, wherever they might lurk. I won't lie and say it's easy. But it is doable. And you will do it, and get through the other side, for those youngsters of yours!! Please remember that breast cancer is very treatable these days. Survival rates are well over 90%, and higher when caught early as yours was. You have a couple of weeks of waiting now before surgery. Please do a couple of things. Firstly, stay away from Dr Google - he is very out of date. and sometimes just evil. So ask any questions here, or sites like CRUK. Secondly, get out and do fun stuff with the kids - it will keep you busy and keep your mind off this to some extent. Also, cook and freeze meals, so you don't have to worry about that after surgery.

      "Content": "Hi chairleg123  - interesting choice of name? OK, so the easy bit - POSNOC trial - the link goes to the trial website. Now the hard bit. As you have had a positive lymph node, they will not do the OncotypeDX test. Which finds out how responsive your cancer would be to chemo. It might be worth asking about it though. Some folks here have paid to have it privately. Without the test, they would want to throw everything at it. Which is where the POSNOC trial comes in. Because you would be very closely monitored, they can be a little more conservative in the treatment. ER8/PR8 will be very responsive to endocrine therapy (tamoxifen et al), and that will be your best defence against reoccurrence. I had a 10mm tumour in 1 node, had full clearance and the others were all clear. But there was no way to know that without taking them out. Mine was Grade 3, very aggressive, so throwing everything at it was the only option. I don't envy you the decision. But go back to your team and ask as many questions as you need to. And please keep posting here - if nothing else it gets the jumble of stuff out of your head and into some sort of order. Besides, there's plenty of hugs available if you stick around!!",

We are a pretty friendly bunch in here, and there is usually someone around to answer questions or lend a shoulder and give you a hug. Your family's reaction is not unusual, it is hard to come to terms with a cancer diagnosis and often people will almost ignore it in the hope it's not real. They will each come to terms with it in their own way and time. Not that that makes it any easier for you!! My office manager was a bit like that, even having had BC herself!! Can you talk with them about it? My hubby unfortunately really struggled with it, and fell apart more than once. I think I spent more time holding everyone else together than anything else. Is your husband coming to appointments with you? It is a good idea to have someone else there, as a lot of what they tell you will get lost in the fog. Another pair of ears (even a notepad!) is helpful to make sure you get everything. The waiting is the worst. Try not to worry too much (although you will - but try to contain it some), and keep busy while you wait for all the tests. And please do come back, so we can support you whatever happens. Breast cancer is very treatable these days, and the vast majority of women go on to live many good years! And you probably need a really big hug!! xx",

I know I just went with the flow, and didn't really ask anything until after starting chemo!! I had that first due to it being aggressive. Most trusts don't do the test if there are positive nodes, it's just straight to chemo, don't pass go, don't collect £200!! There is the NHS Predict tool which might help a bit. It will give an idea of the % benefit of chemo. Ask your consultant about it, as he will have all your test results to hand. Push them for some estimates of the benefit of chemo. Anything over 5% benefit at 5 years, and it's probably a no brainer. Now, chemo is a scary thing. But it is doable. Not pleasant, but not everyone has an awful time either. I worked full time throughout. I'm sure others will be along who know more about the hormone positive side of things than I do. Hugs xx",

I had (perhaps still have, they never did get to the bottom of it) some type of joint inflammatory problem that was causing excruciating pain. The rheumatologist I was seeing prescribed something called Arcoxia. Starting on 90mg a day and reducing to 60mg maintenance dose. It worked a treat, with no side effects. I have no idea what the active ingredient is. I'm suffering some again with chemo and Herceptin, nowhere near as bad, but it's exhausting. Onco unit wouldn't prescribe it, said I had to ask the GP, which I've not done yet. Might be worth exploring? Especially as the tramadol/cocodomol is something you get accustomed to and need more of for the same result. Much like any drugs of that type. PS Constipation - have you tried (if you can) very large doses of Vit C? Increase the dose till you get diarohea, then reduce it slightly. 8000mg a day for me when on steroids.",

But that will only protect against the strains it's made for, which is a best guess 6 months before flu season. And then there's all sorts of other respiratory viruses. She should get a full range of blood tests done, as there's a good chance something is lacking having not bounced back properly. And then whatever you can think of that would boost the immune system.

Herceptin may also be partly responsible for some of your side effects. Have you tried Loratadine (Clarityn)? For some reason in seems to work for some on the filgrastim pain. You could also take ibuprofen in between the cocodamol so you have something every two hours. Not forgetting to check your temperature first of course. As you are HER2+, they do prefer you finish the T part of the chemo, as it is required by NICE in order to have Herceptin. BUT, NICE guidelines are just that - guidelines. It may be worth having a chat with your team, see what options you have. There are a few ladies here who were on the weekly paclitaxel, which should be 12, who only did 8 or 9. Which would be the same as dropping the last T.  I had the T spread over 4 cycles rather than 3. Good luck, whatever you decide to do - it is always your choice!!",

It's probably ok to wait till tomorrow. Try tucking something soft inside your bra, to stop it rubbing, and to absorb the discharge. That should help you feel a little more comfortable in the meantime. Please don't use anything adhesive though!! Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hiya The steroids (and the crash!) are pretty awful. Where chemo is concerned they are used primarily in case of allergic reaction to the chemo, and a secondary benefit is anti-sickness. EC isn't too bad in terms of causing allergic reaction, but Docetaxol/Paclitaxel quite often have that effect and the steroid dose used is double that used on EC. Hence the \"Tax Truck\" when you come down off them!! Filgrastim is a bone marrow booster which gets the blood cell production kickstarted after each chemo dose, to try and avoid neutropenia. They aren't cheap, but they are far cheaper than a hospital stay for sepsis. It doesn't replace the steroids. It is possible to have the T part without steroids, but ANY sign of allergic reaction and it will be stopped immediately. There are other things they can do, like IV antihistamines and so on. Always worth asking beforehand about these. Hope that helps. xx",

Try not to panic too much although it is hard not to (some would say worrying won't change anything). Here is a link to some information about what you can expect over the next 3 weeks or so, if you want to know. I didn't look at anything until I'd had a couple of chemo!! It is possible that it is nothing, although your GP seems fairly sure. Please remember though, if it is, that breast cancer is very treatable these days. And it will be a pretty early catch - due to your vigilance!! Feel free to ask any questions you may have - plenty of ears around here most of the time. Try to keep busy, it does help. And I'm sure you could use a few hugs, so here's one to start you off!! xx",

We also need to move more. That minimum is not so useful if the rest of the time is totally sedentary. Conversely, 10 000 (or more) steps at a stroll is not helpful either. Well, being outdoors and moving is good for the mind and soul, so it has some benefit!! So, my average day of 7000 or so steps and 20+ floors keeps me moving, but unless I actually run up all those stairs in one hit it has no cardio benefit.  Ok, I'll stop rambling now.",

He told me the same thing, keep elevated, and demonstrated very clearly what I should be looking out for if there was anything sinister about it. It is slowly calming down, and returns to normal quicker on elevation. I rarely drink, so no connection there. I have been on my feet a lot which may be a factor. Keeping a close eye.",

      "Content": "Hi hugle32  Firstly, a warm welcome to the community. What a wonderful daughter you are!! How is your Mum doing after her surgery? Chemo. Ok, first thing, have a look at the May Chemo Club - the first post has a link to a useful hints and tips page. The main things to do before chemo - spring clean the house so that minimal cleaning is required for a while. And stock the freezer with tasty meals. Although bear in mind that taste buds are one of the things affected, so those meals may only be used in week 3 of each cycle. Stock up on a variety of drinks. Things don't taste right, and fluid intake is super important. I lived on tomato soup, milk and ice cream. Tea and coffee tasted awful - and I don't function well without a cuppa!!! So different flavours and textures. She will find the one that works.  Is she going to try the cold cap? If not, then a short haircut to minimise the trauma of hair falling out. I had hubby buzz cut mine - I'd always said that's what I'd do, so the commando look wasn't too much of an issue for me. Also, spend some fun time at the shops getting scarves and hats, or indeed wigs if that is her preference. The important thing is, have fun doing it, to take control of what is happening. Now, do YOU have a support network? I think we forget sometimes that those around us are suffering more in some ways, as you have no control over what is happening. And there is the fear of losing someone you love lurking in the background. There is an excellent Family and Friends group on this site, so why not pop over there too and see whether it may be of help to you. Please stay away from Dr Google through this, as he is often out of date and sometimes just plain evil. Stick to recognised sites like this one, CRUK and so on. Breast cancer is very survivable these days, with over 90% of women going on to live full lives. Last but not least, massive hugs to both of you!!! Please keep posting, and let us know how you are both getting on.",

Do see your dentist before you start though, as any work that invades your gums will need to be done first.  The ZA makes your bones deposit more calcium, so they become denser. This can sometimes lead to small fractures, but usually when the ZA is given for extended periods rather than the 3 year period we get it for. The first infusion may cause you to feel like you have the flu for a few days, but after that it's fine. Hugs xx",

I did have surgery after chemo, about 6 weeks if memory serves me right, and the pre-op bloods were fine. It's not a problem if RT starts in 6 weeks rather than 4 I shouldn't think. It is pretty much the mop up stage just in case. You could try eating liver (I like it, but I know a lot of folks don't!), as that is one of the iron rich parts of the beast. But really, it's about your marrow making new blood cells - red ones as well as white ones. And it does take some time. My bloods were worse a month ago that they were at pre-op in March.

There is pretty much always a friendly ear on here - whether you want to ask questions or just have a figurative shoulder to lean on!! So feel free to ask away, although if you could tell us a bit more about yourself and diagnosis it will be easier to guide you to the right information for you. And there's always a welcoming hug :",

It is unlikely that it would be spreading somewhere else at the same time. So I think the nurse is probably right on this one - it's hospital procedure. After all, they don't want to miss anything if they can help it. Funny how sometimes we don't get enough scans (like after treatment), and other times there are so many we panic. Hugs xx",

The lymph was 1/15, and that was 1cm. After chemo. I had CT and bone scan prior to chemo, nothing since. It is not standard practice to do MRI etc after treatment unless there are symptoms that warrant it. My pathology showed clear margins, followed by RT. If all that didn't kill everything, too bad. I'm not well enough for more treatment at the moment. I have had to stop Herceptin after 12 due to heart failure. No hormonal treatment for me as ER0/PR0. I am getting biophosphonates. I guess if you push hard enough they will do a scan to \"make you stop\". But it is not standard practice. Re node involvement. One node was 10mm, and no trace in any of the others. So I am convinced the treatment worked. Hope that helps xx",

Most centres give these now, although they are expensive they are a lot cheaper than hospitalisation for neutropenia. It's worth an ask I think. Do ask for the strongest they can give you on the painkiller side. The T part does cause joint and muscle aches, and it's a good idea to preload the painkillers. Take them before the pain builds up as it's easier to keep on top of that way. Hugs xx",

And I found one there that I never saw at diagnosis time (I'm copied in on them usually) If I'm reading it right, my initial dx was TNBC from the core biopsy of the lump. I never saw that one. The HER2+ low amplification appears to have come from the fine needle aspiration of the lymph node. Which explains why my surgeon said I was HER2 neg. - leading to me having a meltdown over Herceptin. Made me wonder what else has gone on. So I've spent a half hour reading all the letters. The oncology registrar reported my LVEF as 55% (when the previous echo had been 54%), the oncologist said 50% but agreed to refer the scans to cardiology. SHE said - oh dear - you guys have overestimated this, it's actually 40% - stop Herceptin now. It looks like Oncology was trying to gloss things over to get me to continue Herceptin. I'm so glad I threw the toys out and refused!! So ladies, if you have the option of signing up for online repeats, do it. And read everything. And question anything that doesn't add up!! xx",

I have had anaesthetic patches in the past, which are quite helpful. Usually it does resolve, but if not, and all non-invasive options are exhausted, they can drain the bursa to make things more comfortable. It is a last resort due to infection risk though. Heels are a no-no. They cause your ligaments and tendons to rub over the bones at the joints in ways they weren't designed to do. Which inflames the bursa more. Rest is the best thing to do. You could also try alternating heat with ice, it's more effective that way. Hugs xx",

There are things you can do for this. The usual route is certain antidepressants reduce hot flushes significantly, which will help your sleep. They will help with the mood swings to a degree also. Most of the other symptoms DO ease with time. How much time? We're all different unfortunately, so it's hard to say. There are some ladies on here who are taking antidepressants for this, so they would be able to advise which ones. I'll do a bit of poking around and see if I can find out. Paracetamol regularly can help with the painful symptoms. I always found a hot bath helps with the joint issues. Increase water intake - strangely that can help with bloating. Keeping active is hard, but it also helps. I had to stretch and mobilise joints before getting out of bed, especially ankles/Achilles, or I'd fall over when I stood up. Hope that helps. Will be back shortly if I find anything out xx",

Others have assured me the first is the worst. I started menopause at 39, so had been on HRT for 10years when I found the lump. (I'm hormone negative, so HRT not to blame!) The risk of osteoporosis was too high not to. And I had every symptom in the book, it was awful. Moody cow, check. Alternating between freezing and dripping, check. Exhaustion and lack of sleep, check. Achy bones and joints, check. Constipated chicken walk, check. Getting chucked into it for the second time was the least fun bit of this whole palaver. I'm only just 50, GP won't let me back on HRT, so Zoledronic Acid is the way to go. It's only for 3 years.  Nothing noticeable, although I'm sure they would see it on xrays and stuff. It has the added benefit of helping to prevent bone secondaries. xx",

      "Content": "Hey ladies Not sure Herceptin accounts for all of it. I had my last H back in July (stopped after 12), and totally stiffen up within 10min of sitting now. I suspect it is down to lack of oestrogen, as I had the same when I started menopause 12 years ago. It went on HRT which my GP stopped, and has pretty much been a constant since end of chemo. So I do the constipated chicken walk, and drop things regularly because my finger joints are sore. Very painful some days, and have a repeat script for 30mg cocodamol. That only gives me an hour or so when I take 2. It's tricky when I'm driving an hour or two at a time, and have to stop and walk frequently.  Movement is about the only thing that helps, apart from hot baths. I'm not on any AI's or Tamoxifen by the way. I've about had enough, and am thinking about going back on HRT. xx",

The main problem is the line slowly pulling out of the vein. It can't be pushed back in due to infection risk. See if you can get a Portacath. I wasn't going to be able to shoot arrows with a PICC, so they gave me the Portacath. It is all internal, fitted under local. Needs about a week to heal and settle. Then you can do most things - I did archery and continued to install intruder alarms. If you push the quality of life and mental wellbeing angle hard, they should help you out. Wellbeing is incredibly important during chemo, and make a huge difference to how we cope with it. Hugs xx",

But you may want to start pushing for a DEXA scan about a year before the ZA finishes, as waiting times are looooong. I'm getting ZA for 3 years too, had 2 and 4 to go. I asked if I needed a DEXA, and my oncologist said no, he didn't want the waters muddied. He wanted me to have the ZA as a reoccurrence prevention, and if the DEXA results were good then I wouldn't be allowed to have it.  I was on HRT for 10 years prior to dx, and have been back on it for a week now. I couldn't cope with the pains and lack of sleep. Mine was hormone negative, and onco okayed it. xx",

All sports injuries and there were a few. 15mg cocodamol was sufficient though. Chemo Wed, worked Thur/Fri, crash started Fri night. Was back at work Mon. The crash is harder because the steroid dose is higher. Steroids make you hungry. I gained weight because I ate whatever tasted ok. Probably 1 1/2 stone over the 4 months of chemo. But I was 1st underweight at the start. For me it was easier than EC. Because I didn't feel totally rubbish for 10 days every cycle. The effects are cumulative. The last of 4 was the worst, and I took a couple of extra days off. Hope that helps!! Hugs xx",

So by gathering info on how the issue presents with different platforms and browsers, it helps them to work out what is actually happening.  It seems to me that there is  a plug-in issue, which is affecting different combinations in different ways. And I think THAT has been an issue for quite some time. The Azure crash and the last Windows10 update have created the perfect storm, and they just can't work out where the coding translation has broken. I agree, it would make sense to go back to the hard server, the last point where things actually worked. But to make that work properly, all dormant accounts and old threads should also be archived, to improve traffic flow. I certainly didn't get the impression they are blaming US, in any way. Quite the opposite actually. I'm aware of a number of websites, hubby's work training platform is one, that just will not work with certain browsers. Now that isn't a problem for them, as they can use work PC's to do their training if necessary. For us, completely different story -  My phone came up with a switchboard number. I think his name was Matthew, but I can't swear to it. I was so taken aback getting the call when I had specified email contact only, that I didn't take it in.",

They inject dye to trace the lymph drainage from the breast, and the first 3 or so show up brighter than the rest, so they are the first in line. Most often, the spread stops there. Now comes the tough decision for you. It could have spread to further nodes. But if the scan shows it clear, then it's a few cells and not an actual growth. There are 2 ways of dealing with it. Radiotherapy to the armpit to zap any cells that may have escaped. OR, a full axillary node clearance. Both carry risks and advantages, which you will need to discuss with your oncologist. Just to take some of the worry away, I had a node show up very hot on ultrasound. So a full clearance was always the plan for me. I had 15 nodes, and only that one was positive. It was still a 10mm tumour after chemo, and had not spread any further. There are others here who had 30 or more nodes, with most of them positive, and they are still here and still NED. So, I guess you have a lot of questions for your team. Don't be afraid to ask them, and keep asking until the answers make sense!! Hugs xx",

Mine was 4cm x 3m Grade 3 when I found it, and already spread to lymph node - they could see it on the ultrasound. The extra scans showed no further spread. I had probably had it for at least 8 months already by then. I had chemo first due to being HER2+, then surgery. The post surgery pathology showed no further lymph nodes were affected, just the one.

Mine was pretty much back a couple of moths after chemo when I had it cut to about a no.5 to even it all out. Although I had a good covering by the end of chemo as it started growing again on the T part. The rest of my hair grew back first, I could have done without having to get a razor out again!!

      "Content": "IWe do have a great thing in the NHS, there are problems in some areas, but for the most part it works very well. I too have had all the conventional treatments. And am suffering extreme fatigue and joint pain as a result. But I will live. That said, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that more conservative treatments such as chloecat45 has had can contain the cancer and keep it stable for quite some time. Shrink it even. Which is helpful when it might be inoperable. We all want to give ourselves two things 1)the best chance of survival and 2)a reasonable quality of life. And these things need to be balanced to some degree. There is also significant research into many aspects of cancer treatment. Genome testing is used with great success in some areas. Like the OncotypeDX test, to determine whether chemo is of any benefit in ER+ cancer. Why have it if it isn't going to help? I'm having Herceptin. I am low amplification HER2+, and research shows it very likely isn't of any benefit to me at all. And now it's causing heart issues. I may very well choose to stop the treatment due to it causing more harm than benefit. Many of us do our own research. We look for and read papers being written about cutting edge treatment possibilities. And there are many. We don't think we know better than the scientists. But we do read as much as we can about the research that is happening. chloecat45 I wish you the very best in finding your way forward from where you are now. You've had a very difficult journey so far. Hugs xx",

You'll find a lot of friendly folk here (some of us a little bonkers I'm sure!), with support, advice and shoulders to cry on. Wow, it's all happening fast isn't it? I at least had chemo first so had plenty of time to think about the recon. So, factors for me - I wanted the shortest surgery with the fastest recovery time. And I need back and stomach muscles for archery so my surgeon wasn't getting anywhere near them!! Which meant having an implant. I had left mx and full clearance with immediate implant. It's a little big (I was 36AA - left is probably closer to B now) and slightly tight, but I only notice it when really reaching for something now. I had full movement and was back at work in 2 weeks. Back shooting arrows after 6 weeks. I'm sure folks with experience of other types of recon will be along soon. Hugs xx",

I did have immediate implant recon though, as I have a thing about symmetry!! I've taken to wearing sports crop tops I get cheap as chips in Sports Direct. They are so comfy I can't see me going away from them again now!! Regular bras just feel like they are crushing me now, especially just under and left of the new boob. Good luck finding something that works for you. The chicken fillet type filler has been mentioned on another thread. Apparently available on the usual global web retailer!! Hugs xx",

These bloods are indicative of an autoimmune issue, but it's probably too soon after chemo to get anyone to take me seriously.

There are trained staff taking the calls, who are better able to advise than we are. You mentioned a stage 3 diagnosis - have you had a biopsy on the lymph nodes?

Which is NOT useful when having hot flushes!! Tiger balm helps some. But also quite strong smelling.  Have you tried ibuprofen gel? I tend to go sit in a hot bath for a while in the evenings. Took me about 5 goes to screw a magnet to a door this morning. I can supply a hug though. xx",

It might be worth bothering them for an appointment on a cancelation. If you call every day or two, they might squeeze you in!! The waiting around is the worst part. I had a MUGA scan last week, no results yet. If I don't get them by Wed, I will be missing yet another Herceptin shot as I have refused to continue until I get an accurate LVEF measurement. Had my one year mammo on Thursday. More waiting for results. But once you actually get going it should help you settle down. Try to keep busy, and restrict the time you spend worrying. Use the time to prepare. Stock the freezer with precooked meals.  Spring clean the house - you won't get to it again for a year due to low energy levels. If you have offers of help, transport, chemo buddies - nail them down to firm arrangements. And get lots of hugs!! xx",

Just to have a second pair of ears listening to all the information, as it can be a bit of an overload. Also make notes if you need to. And write down any questions you may have - I know I had a bit of brain fade and couldn't remember much of what they said!! I know you will worry, but try to restrict it if you can.

      "Content": "Hey summerholiday  A very warm welcome to the community - the club none of us particularly wanted to join!! I didn't have any scans during chemo at all. In fact I didn't even see my oncologist, just his (pretty useless) registrar half way through. I thought it shrunk a lot on EC, but T had no effect at all. So a midway scan wouldn't have meant much anyway.  The usual wait for scan results would be 10-14 days, so try not to worry too much about it. I'm sure you have a good idea of whether it feels smaller or not - I know I couldn't stop poking the thing to see!! The other thing is, sometimes the tumour just goes soft as the cells die, rather than disappearing. So the scan is an indicator, rather than a definitive. The only definitive here is the post surgery pathology. Did you have any hot lymph nodes? That might be what they mean by satellite nodules, but I don't think so. I'm glad you have managed the side effects well - we need more \"good\" chemo stories, as those are the ones we don't hear about!! Do keep posting on here, and have a look at the April Chemo Club (if you haven't already!), as there is a lot of useful info there if you need it. Hugs xx",

I'm sure you will get more responses from those who have tried acupuncture and ladycare magnets with great success. Apparently caffeine makes it worse, so worth cutting that out to see. I've heard the same about carbs. Some anti-depressants are good at stopping/reducing hot flushes. That is the route I've taken, as I have started sliding back into depression. The one I've chosen is Mirtazapine, because I know from experience it has a good sedative effect. There are others, I'm sure someone will be along to share. I hope you find something that works for you without pushing up oestrogen levels (are you on Tamoxifen or similar?), the lack of sleep can be very debilitating. Hugs xx",

      "Content": "I can answer some of those I think - if my brain works!! EC is effectively the same as FEC. Some trusts no longer use F as the side effects outweigh the benefits. I had EC, and worked through it as I didn't get much in the way of side effects. My EC was accelerated so every 2 weeks, and I had 3 of them. Side effects - some nausea controlled with meds, and fatigue. One A&E visit for chest pains that turned out to be nothing, but had to be checked out. T there are 2 different ones. Paclitaxel (Taxol) is weekly for 12 weeks. The dosage is lower, and so the side effects hopefully not as severe. Docetaxal (Taxotere) is usually given every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. However, some have it accelerated, every 2 weeks (possibly at a slightly lower dose, I don't know). I had mine in 4 cycles for the same total dose, so mine were 75 whatevers, rather than the usual 100. Side effects - not straight away due to steroids. Days 3/4 - 7/9 bone and joint aches, again controlled with meds. Also acid reflux. Sorry you had to have ANC. I had mine 2 weeks ago after chemo. We knew from the original scans I had node involvement, so went straight to mx and ANC without SNB. I had immediate implant recon, and now back at work. (I work from home at the moment). Don't worry too much about the differences - we are all different, and most oncologists tailor the treatment to suit our specific set of pathology. In your case, the cancer is out, and the chemo is to mop up any stray cells left behind. It's scary, but it is doable. One minute at a time some days, but doable. Good luck xx",

The waiting for tests and results is indeed the hardest part. Most lumps are not sinister. I didn't see a surgeon until after the tests. I was referred on an urgent 2 week referral, and had mammogram, ultrasound and biopsies all at the same time. (breast lump and suspicious node) After that you will be called back for results. This can be 2 or 3 weeks after the scans, although they do try to get you in sooner some centres are very busy and it's not possible. It is probably a good idea to insist on a biopsy, even if the ultrasound doesn't show it as hot. For your peace of mind as much as anything else. Again, try not to worry too much. Although you will. This sounds like a very early catch, which is good. Worrying can't change the result, and if it should turn out to be cancer, you're on the conveyor which does move pretty quickly for the most part. Here's a link to what happens during this testing stage  Try to keep busy, rest when you can. And here's another hug, I'm sure you can use a few right now!! xx",

I had an infection that had been rumbling on for a while, I kept putting the extraction off as occasional courses of antibiotics were keeping it at bay. Then I got cancer. I ended up in a big rush to get stuff done before chemo, and had the tooth out the week before starting. It was fine. Do visit the dentist and see what needs doing (if you haven't already), and if it is a root canal needs doing then the last week of the chemo cycle would be the time. Or delay one cycle by a week and do it in that extra week. How have your bloods been recovering between cycles? xx",

As I'd not have been able to do either with a PICC. My job is very physical. It also meant I didn't have the hassle of weekly cleaning and flushing. Once it had settled (about a week or so, for it to heal) I could do pretty much anything I wanted to. Good luck for your chemo, and keep us posted!! Hugs xx",

Although we are a friendly bunch and will help as much as we can. Ok, so to try to answer some of your questions. Grade refers to how aggressive the cancer is. So if the cells are not much different to normal ones it's grade 1. When the cancer cells are very well differentiated from normal ones, it's grade 3. That is not necessarily something to worry about. Mine was grade 3, due to being HER2+. Grading can change when the pathology is repeated after surgery as the sample is larger. A lot of centres don't give staging unless it's stage 4 (metastatic). Mine did't give me a staging. Although I had lymph node involvement. The staging depends on various factors, including size of tumour and node involvement.  You can find some more information on grading and staging here. The CT is usually to check the rest of the lymphatic system. I can't say why they might want another at this stage.  The bone scan is pretty standard these days. Most of us had one at some point. It does provide a baseline for reference in the future. Mine picked up some anomalies, which were old injuries. Please try not to worry too much (although you will, of course, it's your Mum!), but try to restrict the time you spend worrying. Do ask anything you need to know, or just vent your emotions, on here. Hugs xx",

I'm quite a bit younger, but was pretty much back to normal in a month after mx and node clearance. Things she will need help with : Cleaning, laundry, shopping. Anything that needs both arms and heavy (ish) lifting. Making tea and cooking and stuff like that is fine. As long as the kettle is not full (1/2 full is what I was told). If she still drives, she won't be able to for at least 2 weeks. Very important - there are exercises that need to be done. 3x a day. Every day. She may need encouragement to do them - I know I just can't be bothered sometimes, and I lose mobility very quickly! You can download those from the web, will look and see if I can find a link. Starting on those before surgery can be helpful. Arnica. tiny tablets from H&B, very helpful for the healing process. Drink plenty, hospitals can be very dehydrating. I hope all goes well for your aunt, please do let us know. And feel free to ask any questions you have - there's usually someone around who can help. Hugs xx",

It all moved pretty fast for you by the looks of it, I'm sure your head is still spinning!! I trust you have enough family support, having a newborn and a mastectomy can't be easy. The pain in your arm may well be completely unrelated, although often the body finds a way to warn you something isn't right. Until you get your pathology results (do you know yet when you're getting results?), it is impossible to advise really. A shooting pain seems more likely to be a nerve, and there will be added nerve pains after your surgery as they have been cut. Please try not to spend all your time worrying, although it can be hard not to. Once the post-surgery pathology is done, they will have a better idea of where you go next. You say it's hormone positive - that is a \"good\" thing, as you will get Tamoxifen which is VERY effective. Breast cancer is very treatable these days, with well over 90% survival. There's someone around on here most of the time, so feel free to ask any questions or just ramble/vent as you need. Plenty of ears and shoulders!! And I'm sure you can use a hug or two!! xx",

My GP at the time said that over 70% of the population in UK had an \"insufficiency\", although a complete \"deficiency\" was less common. This due to the lower levels of exposure to sunlight. Although I spend hours on archery fields in the summer........ My current issue is, in spite of taking 4000iu D3 a day (with K2), my levels do not increase. Current GP doesn't believe me, so I will be requesting another test soon which he has already agreed to. I suspect that hypothyroidism has an effect on VitD absorption. And thyroid issues are rather common post cancer treatment. Although my thyroid issues go back further, but untreated due to \"normal\" (it was actually upper end of normal) TSH. RT killed half of my thyroid, so now I'm getting treatment. Will report back after the next round of tests.",

      "Content": "Hi Sacha I had left mx with implant and full node clearance on 21 March. Drains out days 8 & 10. Driving after 2 weeks. It is very important to do the exercises to regain mobility, and keep doing them. My own physio gave me more to do which really helped. I suspect my archery played a big role in my recovery, as my left shoulder was in pretty good shape from that. I have a numb patch under my arm and halfway down to my elbow. My nipple was saved - a risk, as it may have meant further surgery, but it paid off as margins were clear. Funniest thing is, it itches - but I can't feel anything when I scratch it!! Some shooting pains where nerves are trying to sort themselves out. Doesn't look like there is any issue with the implant and radiotherapy - 10 of 15 done this morning. I'm probably not the person to ask about self-image type stuff. I'm honestly not bothered. But it was probably a good thing to wake up still having a boob, even if it is a bionic one!! Hope that helps a bit xx",

So mx was required. I don't know what they are, but I'm assuming they are pre-cancerous tissue. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will be along soon. Hugs xx",

That said, all the usual things apply - if there is swelling and heat, or it spreads, then get advice soonest in case of infection.

      "Content": "Please be careful with Dr Google mum and mia - stick to sites like this one or CRUK. There is a lot of outdated and wrong information out there!! Your chemo is likely to be one of 2 combinations, EC+T, with Herceptin starting alongside T (Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide + Taxotere (Docetaxol)) TCH Taxotere, not sure what the C is here, not the same one, Herceptin. The Herceptin carries on by itself, some trusts do 17, mine does 18. Although I am refusing any more until they resolve the heart issue I've developed. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, effectively an oestrogen killer. I don't get those as mine was ER0. Egg on my GP's face as HRT had nothing to do with my cancer..... You will have an echocardiogram before starting H, with follow ups around every 3 months. They are checking LVEF left ventricle ejection fraction. That needs to be over 55% to get H, and if it drops below 50% H has to stop until it recovers. Mine was estimated at my last echo, apparently they couldn't measure it because of my implant. It's borderline, which is why I've refused to continue. Hope all that helps. You pick it all up as you go along. You may want to have a look through the August Chemo Club thread. Do remember that those without bad side effects tend not to post, so don't take it too literally that that's how you will feel. We're all different. xx",

Please be kind to yourself during the waiting for results bit (and after that too!!). It's the hardest part for a lot of people. Once you have results and a plan, it does get easier. I was hormone negative and HER2+, and node positive. The breast lump was 4cm, and the node was still 1cm after chemo. I had chemo, mastectomy + node clearance + implant, and radiotherapy. My Herceptin (for HER2+) was stopped after 12 of 18, as my heart wasn't coping. I am 1 year clear, and discharged by cardiology too. Won't pretend it was easy, but it is doable. I worked fulltime throughout. The nodes are there to catch the nasties. And it's a job they do very well. Please remember that breast cancer is very treatable these days, with well over 90% of women going on to live full lives. Stay away from Dr Google though - he is very out of date and sometimes just plain evil!! Wait until you have all the results, and then ask on here or other reputable sites. One thing that is ALWAYS available here is hugs. Lots of them!! So consider yourself hugged!! xx",

      "Content": "Hi Juju68 , welcome to our friendly community! It could be any or all of the above. Not what you wanted to hear, I know. I had early menopause at 38 (had a hysterectomy at 30), the joint aches, flushes and stiffness were awful. I was barely sleeping. As I was so young, I decided the risk of osteoporosis was too high not to go on HRT. Which I took for 10 years. Fast forward to 49th birthday and a cancer diagnosis. But ER0/PR0 so not connected to the HRT at all. HER2+, so had to have chemo. I stopped the HRT the day I found the lump, and was back in full menopause within 2 weeks - before even starting chemo. I finished chemo 8 Feb.  The aches, stiff joints, sweats and fatigue have got steadily worse. I'm not on Tamoxifen.  So, what to do. I'm taking Evening Primrose oil, Glucosamine, Vit D + K2, etc etc. Also on antidepressants Mirtazapine which has a mild sedative effect. And menopace multi vits. The sweats seem to have reduced a little, in number and intensity. That may be my body adjusting to the lack of oestrogen, it may be some of the above supplements. The joint aches and stiffness is getting worse. I have osteoarthritis in my hands, so it's unlikely to improve. On cocodamol 4x a day just to function. I wish I could tell you a miracle solution. We're all looking for one!! Fluoxetine - I think it's contra indicated with Tamoxifen anyway. Venlafaxine - there are a few folk on here who take it. The anecdotal evidence for it helping with flushes is quite strong. I also take Ambien (sleeping pills) 2 or 3 times a month to try and get the odd good night. Hot bath before bed helps. My alarm is set 1/2 hour before I need to get up, so I can get the joints moving in time to get out of bed. And lastly, a big gentle hug -I'm sure you could use one!! xx",

I'm guessing you've been put on Ramipril, which makes a difference pretty quickly. Once LVEF has gone over 55% again, they will restart your Herceptin. Depending on how long that takes, you may need to have another loading dose. One question - was your HER2 +++ or low amplification? If the latter, then you might want to question whether it's even necessary to finish the H. I stopped after 12, and as it was low amp have elected not to continue. Cardiologist has discharged me as LVEF has been restored to normal. Hugs xx",

Research evidence backs this up, and onco agreed. However, there are a number of ladies on here (the first group who had TCHP), who had pathological complete response (PCR). It seems that this is the case in over half of patients. Perjeta/Pertuzumab is the latest gamechanger for HER2+ cancers. Going back to Herceptin. One of my customers was among the first to get Herceptin when it was initially approved. That was 12 years ago, and she is still NED. So any onco that poo poos the HP combo needs to be reported. The evidence is plain - it works. H alone has improved 5 year survival for HER2+++ from around 60-70% to 85% plus. P will improve that still more. Hugs xx",

Plan to spring clean the kitchen cupboards or something, you have 3 days of that. Side effects don't really kick in until day 3/4, extreme fatigue, joint and bone pain. Get the painkillers in early and keep up with them to stay on top of it. Acid reflux rather than nausea - they can give you stuff for that just ask. Lasts to about day 7-9. Good after that. Furry mouth and cr*p taste. Use the mouthwash (and warm salt or bicarb solution before and after eating) Eat whatever tastes right, don't worry too much about what it is. Possibly diarrhoea rather than constipation. I stayed constipated, took 8000mg of Vit c a day to control it. Herceptin - may cause a bruise if they inject too quickly or you tense up. Relax, they are not too bad. Dry eyes/ watery eyes, drippy nose, possible nose bleeds. Otherwise fine. Other than the fatigue I found it easier than EC. I did work all the way through chemo. Check out the chemo club thread too - lots of tips on there!! You will get through it!!! 2 months on and it's like a bad dream!!",

      "Content": "Hey Leolady56  Don't worry about the Herceptin. You must have a taxane chemo to get it, yes. But it doesn't specify how much chemo. So your H should continue regardless. If they opt to try a different chemo, then you may have to stop H and return to it later (EC and H don't mix!!) There are other chemo's too, like carboplatin and capesomething. They will get you sorted somehow. I'm well chuffed at the result of your complaint - BUT I think he needs more penance. How many lives has he wrecked that we don't know about? Hugs xx",
