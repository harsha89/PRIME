    "Content": "Relax Lellymoo I had axillary clearance on Thursday 25th July discharged on the 26th and showered everyday (I put the drain in a bag for life and hung it on the shower door) I just kept my arm down as much as possible and didnt put soap on the that side. By Monday the 29th I'd developed a blister under the dressing(site op tape).  My BCN said it was an allergic reaction and promptly pulled off the dressing and left it off.  I continued to shower daily and have been absolutely fine.  My wound has been great and its now (two weeks later) completely healed over :D Just be sensible and pat it dry rather than rub and avoid soap and anti-persp. I have even managed to shave the remaining bits of the armpit using an electric razor (though it was a really weird sensation) to go to a wedding I'm still slightly numb under the arm and the back of the top of my arm is 'odd' feeling but it gets better everyday. Don't forget to do your exercises and if in doubt give your BCN a ring they are brilliant people ",
