      "Content": "Well, generally I'm just reading here, as I dont have much to contribute... but I love wigs!  :) I'm at the \"waiting stage\", and no idea whether I have cancer or not... but I do have loads of wigs.  I'm way too lazy to be bothered to do my own hair, all it does gets is a wash every night, and then bunched up in a pony tail... so when I want nice hair - one of my wigs come out.  :) You say the hospital contributes £100, so I'm assuming there's a fair bit to pay personally too? If you got a little bit of money you can spend on wigs - have some fun and go online!  Amazon and ebay is your friends here... honestly - for less than £20 you can get a nice wig.  If you normally have a long fringe where the hairline shows, then it will be quite costly (lace front wig), but if you don't mind one with a fringe that can be swept a little to the side (or cut into a shorter fringe), then you can get them for £10 if you order from a non-UK seller (delivery from China takes approx 10 days). Cheap synthetic wigs are getting better and better.  The difference from now to when I started buying wigs (about 15 years ago) is unbelieveable.  So much more like human hair.  They used to be all shiny and a little bit horrid (but I still loved them), now they look like natural hair. The most natural looking ones are the ones that's a little sparse on the hair, but even if you get one that's got masses of it, a pair of scissors and some trimming can take care of it. Only gotten 2 so far this year, a short brown one (looks great from the back, I might trim the front a little, one of these days) which cost me less than a fiver from AliExpress (similar to Amazon, but you order direct from China.  I have a specific debit card for it, where I only add money on it as and when I order from outside the UK, incase something goes wrong), and a gorgeous pink and blond one which cost just over a tenner (the blond on it looks completely natural... the pink looks... pink!). Otherwise, sometimes little wigstores pop up in the middle of shopping centres, where the wigs are generally reasonably priced, but more expensive than ordering online. Sorry to hear about your fathers dementia, hopefully you'll find a nice wig that will suit you, and don't look too different from your normal style when you go to visit him.  Best of luck!",

      "Content": "Well, turned out there was a reason the \"supervisor\" didn't call back helsbels18... :) And I'm sorry you had to go through similar, LondonLass - it truly does suck! * * * Well, the saga continues... :) As no-one had called me, I started calling at 11:30 today.  By quarter past twelve, I got fed up not having the phone answered, so this time called reception, instead of the nurse clinic. Was told there was two different numbers, and that they'd patch me through on the other number (I called reception back afterwards, and now got both numbers). New BC nurse, who refused to talk to me, and told me the nurse I spoke to yesterday would call me back, in an hour or so.  After an hour I called back yet again, and was now told the BC nurse I spoke to yesterday would give me a call in 20 minutes. She did.  I told her that no \"supervisor\" had called me, and was wondering if she had requested it, as she had previously lied to me yesterday.  She then started threatening to hang up on me, and claimed she didn't lie.  I asked her if she had told me that my biopsies weren't ready, and if she had said that if they were ready they would have been discussed.  She admitted to this, and still claimed she didn't lie, she just didn't know (then why make up a lie, instead of saying \"I don't know\"). I then said she'd also said that she was going to call pathology, and she didn't.  She then claimed she did, but I had called them first.  I then asked why she was surprised that I knew that my results were ready at pathology, when we spoke after that, and she then claimed as I'd informed her about it it was no point in her calling pathology (right... so she never called, although she had just said she did). I then started pushing for more details of this so-called supervisor.  This time the BC nurse said it wasn't a supervisor, it was her manager.  She then also said she had never told me it was her supervisor (oh yes, she did, as I found it a bizarre title).  Just to add an extra little lie, like a sprinkle of sugar.  :)  She claimed the \"manager\" (yes, manager now, not supervisor anymore), didn't have any phone number I could contact her on.  I then asked for a name, and had to keep pushing for one, until I finally got a name, but no department or phone number (remember... this supposed manager has no contact number at the hospital). I wanted to know why she had made no attempt to get my results, she claimed she couldn't.  I then demanded to know the contact details of who could, and she refused to give me any contacts at all.  (Basically just a repeat of yesterdays phonecalls... sigh) I then started pushing for who had requested my results not to be discussed until next week - and the BC nurse hung up on me!!!  :) So, I called reception again, asked them if the name I had been given was the manager of the clinic I'm attending, and if I could have her number (everyone in a hospital has a line they can be reached on).  Receptionist seemed a little puzzled, but said hold on - and next thing I knew I was transferred to a different reception. Again, I asked if the name I had been given was the manager of the clinic - to which the receptionist said \"eh... well.. I guess, kind of\".  Hahahahaha.  Very promising... the exciting hunt for the kind of manager that has no phone! Anyway - she told me she'd pass me on to the \"manager\"s secretary!  I requested the number instead.  :)  Look at that - not just a phonenumber for the \"manager\" - they even got a secretary to answer the phone for them.  Funny how the BC nurse claimed there was no way to contact this supervisor/manager/kind-of person. Now - armed with this so-called manager's number, I called, and was met with the lovliest secretary ever. I asked if her boss was the manager of the clinic... to which she laughed and said no - she's a \"breast consultant\"!!!  Hahahaha. Anyway - this secretary finds the whole thing intriguing, and she cannot understand why my results weren't discussed as they're ready, and she cannot see any reason why a request to delay them was made. Now... I am speculating, as I do not know... but I suspect my BC nurse informed my onco that she had cleared me to get my results via the phone, and then he put in the request as he felt that he was more intitled to know my results that I was.  My results were intended to be discussed yesterday.  My results were ready yesterday.  My BC nurse had left a note to say I was to be given my results via the phone yesterday.  Someone specifically requested my results not be discussed yesterday.  I've realised the BC nurses are nothing but annoying decorations that cannot, and will not, do anything to help me getting my biopsy results (which are ready and waiting... and can be accessed by medical staff on three different systems... pathology lab informed me of this). However, the secretary then gave me the name and position of the person who might know who requested my results not to be discussed (I didn't request a phone number, as I know I can easily get it from reception if need be), and told me she would leave a note for this person to call me tomorrow (as the person who might know who requested my results to be delayed for MDT discussion, is off today). So... today's lesson I've learnt... BC nurses will continute to lie and make things up, even when caught out.  BC nurses doesn't know anything at all (why are they there???  No - really - what exactly are they doing?  I honestly got no idea), and will refuse to try to find out information (I've asked for my results, I've asked for details of who can give me my results, I've asked for who put a one week delay on my results, I've asked for details of who can find out who put the delay on), and will promptly hang up on patients if patients make requests that they cannot be bothered to find the answers to. And poor hubby lost his bet... he was certain I'd get the results today (I was certain I wouldn't.  My bet is Monday, when my \"team\" is back... although I suspect I will also request a different \"team\" come Monday).",

      "Content": "Oh I know, KerryCake - it's totally ridiculous the amount of time that's gone by now.  :)  I'm so glad you got everything happening fairly quickly! I think the whole thing started with the GP (I found my old GP had left a year or so ago, so I took an appointment with a GP I'd never seen before).  As soon as he asked \"how can I help you\", I said \"I want a referral to the hospital, as I got a lump in my breast\".  That was the first time I requested the referral, before the appointment was up, I had reapted my request several times. After feeling the lump, instead of giving me a referral, he started telling me about fibroadenomas (yes, yes, well aware of those... I had loads of time to read up on breast lumps while waiting for my doc appointment), and how \"nothing is done\" to them (it's actually advised for women of my age to have them removed, as they can be in the way of detecting actual cancer lumps if they should appear), with me now starting to repeat my request for a referral.  To be honest, I had no interest in anything he had to say at all, he's only a GP not some sort of specialist in breast lumps, and unless he had some ultrasound scanner hidden somewhere, nothing he could do or say would satisfy me apart from a referral (and even that would probably not have satisfied me as I knew fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors look the same on US, and phyllodes tumors can be malignant). Eventually, after he realised the only thing that would get me out of his office was to give me a referral, he agreed, but it was clearly not something he was happy about.  I seriously hope the guy feels like a douche bag now.  :)  I just got the feeling that I was being pushed to the back, purposely, as it was from there onwards not suspected as cancer.  (I however, had already packed a chemo-bag, just incase, while I waited for the initial doc appointment!  Hahaha.  I like to be prepared) So am very anxious to hear my biopsy results... not beacuse I am worried, but beacuse I want to know, so I can figure out what sort of treatment I want!  Lumpectomy is already out the window (this was something I would have gladly done a few weeks ago... gladly!  I would have said - yup - get it out... expecting a little \"dimple\" where they'd gone digging... now however, I have seen the results of lumpectomies on small breasts, and this has now become \"not an option\"), mastectomy is still an option depending on which cancer I got (I am only considering this for a few), but there I am very worried about the results... not of the mastectomy, but of what a new boob would look like.  And beacuse of how I personally feel about my body (I love it!  All parts of it are equally important to me, and I want them to stay exactly where they are), the option to build me a new breast out of any other parts of my body, is also out the window.  So mastectomy is something I am not keen on (but would still chose, if I felt the need for it). The good thing is - it's given me plenty of time to read.  I am keeping an eye on all new trials, reading up on all sorts of treatments that are generally not offered, and making decicions regarding various drugs, depending on what sort of cancer I got.  I highly doubt I my suggestions will be accepted, but I am prepared to fight for what I feel would be the best for me.  I just wasn't expecting to have to fight to get my blooming biopsy results!  Hahahaha. The bad thing is of course, that my cancer has now had two extra months (as goodness knows how long it's been there, I felt the lump in February, and decided to \"keep an eye on it\"... but I did have a fleeting thought \"didn't I feel something there end of last year?\" when I noticed it in Feb.  If I did actually feel something there last year, it would have been so tiny, I would have discarded it as \"not important\".  I got cognitive issues, and have learnt to discard anything that I deem not important, that way I can try to remember what I feel is important.  My short-term memory issues is also why I write everything down) holidaying in my body since I first saw the doc about it.  :) ",

      "Content": "Rant below! :) No worries, no-one needs to read it, I'm just ranting. :) But I need to write it, getting it off my chest always helps. Well, today was the day I was supposed to get my biopsy results.  As life would have it, it had to be over the phone, due to both my onco and my BC nurse being away. Biopsy taken 6th, was told results would take 10 days when taken.  Next day I called my BC nurse, to request that I would get the results via phone, and I was told they would be in today. End of last week, I called the hospital and spoke to another BC nurse.  She confirmed my BC nurse had added it to my notes that I was to be given the biopsy results over the phone.  I enquired if they were in, and the BC nurse informed me that they would not be in until Wednesday morning, and that I would could get them in the afternoon, after the MDT meeting.  I kept asking about it, as I found it odd they would only \"arrive\" right before the MDT meeting.  She said the results might be worked on right up until the meeting (right...). So, today I called at 11am, in the hope the meeting had finished early, and I could finally get a hold of my results.  The same BC nurse as I spoke to last week, now told me the meeting wasn't until lunch time, and that I would get my results afterwards. Now, I hadn't been to sleep (hubby got day off today, so we watched series until 5am), as I'd had plans on jumping right into bed afterwards... so tired, frustrated and anxious to hear what sort of cancer I got. Twenty past two the BC nurse calls me to say my results were not in.  She told me my case hadn't been discussed at the meeting as the biopsies still weren't in. I enquired as to why this would be the case, and she explained this sometimes happens if they get held up in pathology.  Well - I wanted an explenation, so I demanded to know where and who did the biopsies.  I had to push for an answer several times, and it turns out they're done in-house!  Yup - right there at the hospital.  After a lot of questions from me, she eventually agreed to contact the pathology department to see what the hold up was.  I informed her I would call them to check to make sure she had actually contacted them. By now hubby is up, sees me all teary-eyed and just says \"oh sh!t\"... and goes back to bed.  Hahaha.  He knows very well I cry when I'm angry.  So I call the NHS, and asked for the pathology department at my hospital (they were really helpful!  Quite impressed).  Call them, which turned out to be the pathology lab.  Again, lovely lady gave me the number to the pathology office. Called the pathology office (and no, the BC nurse hadn't called them), who seemed really surprised a patient was calling them.  :)  I asked why my biopsy results had been held up, as I had been told they weren't ready, and I wanted to know why.  She took all my details, and promised to call me back.  Just a few minutes later, she calls me back - my biopsy results are ready. That's right - biopsy results all done and dusted, but she informed me that they had been informed to file them for next weeks MDT meeting!  So the BC nurse lied to me, whether by stupidity, ignorance or not giving a damn, I don't know. Anyway, I thank the pathology office lady, and call the BC nurse back, informing her my results are ready, and they had not been delayed in pathology, and I demanded to know my results.  She still refuses to give them out, and I ask about the legality of this whole issue, as I was cleared to get them over the phone, and the results are available (I am not interested in the ramblings of the MDT, I want the biopsy results.  My BC nurse was aware of this).  The BC nurse doesn't know anything about the legality of it. So - next I call the local NHS again, to get the legal department this time... then onto the phone to them, and they are telling me I am entitled to my results, they do however not know whom to give them to me (as both my onco and BC nurse is way, and the BC nurses that are on duty won't chase them up and give them to me), so they direct my to patient archives. There they tell me I can get all my info in writing by making a written request (yes, yes, I know that), so I explain my situation once again, regarding my onco being away, and results are not being shared with me, and that I just want to be informed about the biopsy results, I don't need them in writing. They too tell me I should be told the results, and offer apologies that they do not have the results available to give to me, and suggest I call the BC nurse again. So, now 10 past four in the afternoon, and yet again I find myself on the phone with the same BC nurse that told me the biopsy results had been delayed in pathology (grrrrrrr!), and she now informs me she's spoken to her \u201csupervisor\u201d (no name offered), and that she (the BC nurse), had been informed (by her supervisor), not to give the results to me (hah! Considering they don't even have the results yet \u2013 they're still in pathology, and can be accessed on three different systems, and the BC nurse is telling me she gets \u201cunauthorised\u201d if she tries to access them... well \u2013 atleast she now admits they have the facility to access them!). I then demand to speak to the supervisor. BC nurse claims there's no phone number I can be given for the supervisor (really \u2013 no name and department I can call???), but that she (the BC nurse) will inform her supervisor to call me. Sigh! Aaaaaand, that's as far as I got. No-one called me back (I however, will be straight on the phone tomorrow). So... what I got out of today is... the BC nurses will lie if they do not know a fact. They will put blame on blameless departments (I'm sure the pathology department isn't too impressed the BC nurses tells patients that results are delayed in pathology, when that isn't the case), they will make no effort chasing things up, or actually checking facts. How am I supposed to trust them with my well-being, if they cannot even be honest about a result, and where it is? Who requested the results not to be filed until next week? Was it my onco (I will request a change immediately if this is the case)? The only one that's come through, as a shining star among all the mud, is my BC nurse (who's currently away). She wasn't keen on the idea, but she agreed that I was to be given the results via phone, as this would be beneficial for my well-being, and she informed the other nurses regarding this. These are people I am supposed to trust with my health, in fact my life. I don't trust them as far as I can throw them... and considering I got the strength of a toddler, that says a lot.  :)",

      "Content": "Well, today's a short (well, shorter-ish) and \"sweet\" one.  Didn't get a call, so called up myself. Turned out this person knew who'd put a stopper to my results being discussed, and it was who I suspected.  :) I then asked how I go about being put under someone else (as I will not let someone who purposely put a delay on my results being discussed treat me in any sort of way), to which she refused to answer (not even say \"I don't know\"). I did however book an appointment with \"I don't give a damn how my actions affect patients\" for Monday, as I want to tell him in person how it's made me feel.  And then I will request from him to be put under someone else.  However, I don't want to show up to be pushed around with some bullocks, so I then called a Maggie's Centre (as I cannot trust any information from the breast care nurses, and simply don't know who else to contact), to find out who to complain to if there's going to be any issues regarding my request. I now have both a phone number, an address, and an e-mail address to contact my local health board with a complaint.  :)  The Maggie's Centre was really helpful - the opposite of the breast care nurses.  Hahahaha.  I mean, the lovely cancer support specialist there really went searching, to make sure I got all the info needed.  Also advised me of several other routes I could go down, if I felt the need.  If worst comes to worst, I will ask for a transfer to my local hospital (I specifically asked for the hospital I am currently at, when having my initial doctors appointment, all the way back in May, just incase I need chemo... as hubby can then just drop me off on his way to work, and pick me up later... unlike my \"local\" hospital, as he would then need to use his days off to drive me... as \"local\" is still a long way away when taking a bus... really wish I'd bothered to take my driving licence now, something I've never bothered about before).  So... there you go - tomorrow it will be 2 months since I first saw the doc, and I still don't know what sort of cancer I got.  :)  Back to feeling like I got \"Schrödinger's cat cancer\"... but now instead of both having and not having cancer, I basically have all the cancers until the box is opened.  Hahaha!   Other then that, life's good.  :) ",

      "Content": "Hi angebow65!  'fraid I won't be of any help at all regarding a tattoo and risk of any lymphodema, my suggestion there would be to talk to your \"cancer team\", and also talk with a tattooist.  :) But - do you have any other tattoos?  If this is your first, then you really need to have a good long think about the wrist.  I think wrist tattoos are very pretty (well, it doesn't of course depend on the tattoo itself!  Hahaha), but it's somewhere where it's very difficult to hide it (long sleeves doesn't do it, as they always ride up a little to show the wrist during movements), if you for some reason want to do so.  And the reason I do not have one on the wrist (I have three). All my tattoos are in areas where I can easily cover them with clothing (one of them is very often on display).  Nowadays no-one will judge people or look at people differently due to a tattoo, but if the tattoo is in a place where it's visible at all time you yourself might become concious of it in certain situations, it can be a distraction both to yourself and others.  That said, it's a wonderful talking point.  :) ",

      "Content": "Lacomtekp It is one area where I think the French system is generally much better. Where possible we take our results away with us or at least receive a telephone call at the first possible opportunity. I was told my biopsie would take 10 days but actually received the call from my GP on the 8th day. He was very reassuring although of course a lot more analysis needed to be done but he had made all the relevant appointments for just a few days later. If it can be done here, why not in your area? I know... the system here is terrible.  :)  I didn't grow up here (but have spent my whole working and adult life here), so have experience with health systems in other countries... if it's something serious they're always straight on the case as soon as possible!  Either to assure there's nothing serious going on, or to inform, so they can sort you out asap.  :) I'm not really upset (just furious), I already have my treatment suggestions written out.  Hahahaha.  All depends on the biopsy results, which one I intend to pursue (you'd think I'm determined getting my results, but just wait until I'm about to request a treatment!  Hahahaha).  :)  The results I was promised today.  Grrrr.  Up all night waiting for them, only to be lied to.  I cannot stand the thought of not knowing what sort of cancer I got, when the results are ready and waiting - only to be refused to be told what it is.",

      "Content": "Flopsyuk It did sound too good to be true that they agreed to give you your results by phone and I wonder if that is where the lying started. Maybe they were only \"humouring you\". Full in the knowledge of the delays that normally occur. They probably never thought you would be so determined and probably thought that they could fob you off. It costs them absolutely nothing to add to your file that you are to be given your results by phone and then do nothing / lie when you call. If they've checked my files, they'd know this is \"common practice\" with me.  My old GP (God I miss the bastard), just gave in, in the end... and I would receive results either over the phone, or going to pick up a copy (of things like an ECG) at the reception, without having to see him.  My BC nurse was against it, but, she agreed when I presented my case (it's makes it very hard for anyone in a medical profession to reject).  :)  :)  :)  And yes, I did call to check, to make sure she wasn't just saying so.  (She's really sweet, way too sweet for me, she's got those kind and comforting eyes that make me feel uncomfortable.  Hahaha). It's the pits though... I want facts, and when something is said, I do expect it to be set in stone.  And you're right - like having cancer wasn't enough - let's feed the patients lies too.  Hahahah. I'm sorry you had a bad experience.  :(  It's such a tough time, added stress in any way or form is really the last thing we need. I might make a formal comlaint (everything, from my first doctors appointment is written down, there's already been two \"incidents\" before, one where the lady who took my mammogram lied to me, secondly a nurse kept hurting me although she was informed she was causing me uneccessary pain), after my cancer is \"sorted\".  Might.  It all depends on the outcome of my cancer journey.  If the cancer goes, then I couldn't care less, and will find something else to occupy my mind... if not, then I will review all my notes.  :)  Would keep me busy.  :)",

      "Content": "Good luck for the results on the 28th!  Do you have invase, or non-invase (in situ) ductal cancer?  Only asking as curious.  :)  My biopsy results came back as DCIS, but was told it's suspected it's invasive, and advised to have another biopsy done (waiting to be assigned under someone new, so will ask them for their opinion when that happens).  Well, you know what I'm gonna ask for if it's invasive (I'm the RFA fan).  Hahahaha.  If I do a second biopsy (or whomever will be dealing with my case finds that there's no need for a second biopsy) and it's non-invase, I'll just leave it to it's own devices, and have a mammogram once a year (hubby want me to do them every 6 months... we'll see.  If it makes him happier, I'll oblige).",

      "Content": "Cheers chloecat45 - I've never heard of invasive cancer referred to as invasive DCIS, as DCIS generally gets classed as IDC, as soon as it's out of the ducts (estimated approx 50% of DCIS will never change to invasive... hence why I would just opt for a \"keep an eye\" approach if I only have DCIS).  :)  Interesting to see what they say about RFA - please do let me know!!!  It's approved for breast cancer tumours in the US, and it's approved for cancer tumours here in the UK.  Cannot find much info regarding what it \"can\" (basically, what they will use it on) be used on via the NHS website, although this particular one says: RFA is mainly used to treat: \u2022 liver cancer that has started in the liver (primary) or a cancer that has spread to the liver from another part of the body (secondary liver cancer) \u2022lung cancer that has started in the lung (primary) or a cancer that has spread to the lung from another part of the body (secondary lung cancer) \u2022 kidney cancer. I personally take the use of the word \"mainly\" as meaning \"there's tons of other ways we can use this!\".  Hahahah. ",

The good thing is that your path to eliminating the cancer is already starting to appear in front of you.  :)  The MRI will help guide which way the path will turn to reach the \"no more cancer\" signpost on the end.  :) I'm at the stage where I'm still waiting for my biopsy results (cancer has already been confirmed), and after that it will be to figure out what treatment I'll be having. ",
