    "Content": "Jackie, I didn't have the same chemotherapy as you but I can share some of the things that worked for me. I had my chemotherapy every 3 weeks and I made sure that I always had something planned in to look forward to towards the end if those 3 weeks when I would be feeling at my best to enjoy it, be it a treat like a manicure or lunch with special friends but I learnt the hard hard way only to plan a cycle at a time as depending on your blood results your date of chemotherapy can shift I also found some complementary therapies that really helped both reflexology and shiatsu (tried some others like meditation but that wasn't for me) so explore what is available around you to help support you through this.",
