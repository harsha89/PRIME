      "Content": "This is really good to know for those that need chemo. Â I did something really stupid even before I had been officially diagnosed, I got in my mind that I definitely had cancer and would lose my hair following chemo, so I might as well get it cut now and no-one will notice!!! Result is that 5 weeks on, I don't need chemo, only radio, and I have short (1.5\" all over) hair and it was all unnecessary, moral to story, take each day as it comes, and wait to hear your diagnosis before you do anything too stupid, XD",
