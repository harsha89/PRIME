      "Content": "Hi all, I hade wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy 22 aug and the axillary clearance 16 sept, after the first op i felt great, but after the second i still feel really lousey, i'm tired all the time and have constant pain under my arm and down as far as my elbow, also the whole area including my shoullder is numb and movement is quite restricted and when i do move it more than usual i get sharp shooting pains down to my elbow...Has anyone else been left with these feelings and how long did they last... I am due to start chemo in 2 weeks time and am prepared for feeling even worse with that but the lack of ability to move my arm properly is realy starting to get me down.I would be grateful for anyone else experiences on this..Thanks",
