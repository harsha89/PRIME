      "Content": "Hi, I had 6 x FEC treatments and was very thirsty for a couple of days after every one.  I am a diabetic and thought that combined with the chemo was responsible but my oncologist said it was the steroids that I was given both during and after chemo.  The thirst settled down to normal levels after a couple of days each time but the constant drinking and peeing was frankly knackering!   Sue",

      "Content": "Thanks Sue, Rt has been put back a week or two. As thought i do not have enough movement in my arm so am having some physio to help the extension and rotation so they can get more of the lung field out of the way.  This should not interfere with  starting the Tax but it means that i have to go back for another planning session in two weeks. Still, the sun is shining, my hair is growing back after the last lot of chemo and for the first time in six months I had to shave my legs yesterday.  That's progress for you!   Sue",

      "Content": "Hi guys, I was dignosed with BC last October (invasive lobular). It was right back against the chest wall so by the time it became apparent to me the lump was about 8cm. It was originally not palpable due to its depth! I have had 6xFEC, which reduced the tumour significantly, mastectomy with axilliary clearance which showed that all lymph nodes were affected.  The next step is 25 x radiotherapy followed by 4 x Docetaxel. Oh joy! Now just waiting for my Rt planning and marking and religiously doing my excercises so that I have a good range of arm movement.  It's a bit difficult as before surgery I was being treated for a frozen shoulder so I'm having some problems with rotation!  Such is life. The good news is that I should have hai for Christmas this year!",

      "Content": "Had my first Tax last Wednesday and boy, oh boy what a rollercoaster of a week!  I am a diabetic and had been warned that the steroids needed to cope with Tax ' may make my blood sugars a little off whack!'  That was the understatement of the year! Treatment day was fine, as was the day after. Friday I started to feel a little'fluey' but nothing I couldn't cope with.  Friday night the train hit me and Saturday my husband had to go and get me some Tramadol from my oncology nurse.  This was blissful, became my new best friend and I at least was able to sleep.  Then the sweats started........Whilst I had been taking the steroids I felt fine, the minute I came off them ...bam. Whacky blood sugars.  My GP sent me for bloods to the hospital and I see her tomorrow to discuss what can be done to lower my sugars whilst I'm  on this damn drug. I did not have this trouble during the 6 x Fec earlier in the year.  I am only now feeling like I've rejoined the human race after a week. Anyone else diabetic and going through this too. I would be interested in hearing how you cope!",

      "Content": "I've got my 2nd Tax next Wednesday. Got the Tramadol, the fizzy pop and strong tasting cheese.  My tongue still feels a bit woolly after the first dose and I expect it'll feel fine on Tuesday! (Just in time to turn into a lump of cotton wool again!) My daughter reckons I'm quite dangerous at the moment due to chemo brain!  She won't let me order anything for our shop as I keep getting the quantities wrong!  Teaching a beading class today was fun too. Trying to talk with 'numb tongue' doesn't really help the dialogue flow! So far the nail beds are fine, the hair has started to fall out again but the new wig is on order.  If it doesn't arrive next week I guess I'll have to resurrect 'Mildred' (my previous wig) out of her drawer and tell everyone I had hair extensions put in over the weekend as it's a little longer than the hair that's grown back from the last lot of chemo!  Oh well, only another three doses and it's all over. It's been a long haul, nearly a year all told so roll on October. Good luck with the next round girls. Sue",

Thanks for all the tips girls. Got the dark nail polish on order.  My daughter, a bit of a gardening guru, reckons that a concoction made from steeping horsetail ( a weed that grows prolifically in my garden) in boiling water then using it as a soak for nails is a really good nail conditioner . I'll let you know the results!",
