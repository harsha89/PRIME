    "Content": "Hey. reading about your heart, made me realise, I suddenly have a racing heart for the slightest exertion...walking from the hall to the kitchen, taking the bins out...never really computed it to the letrizole. I also have frequent dizzy spells where its like I am going to faint. quite scary when its happening. I am super forgetful, literally talking and forget what we were talking about....short tempered, put that down to exhaustion from the insomnia. Im now 3 days off Letrizole, The twinges in my wrist is subsiding although some actions are still giving me twinges. My ankles are still stiff, but not painful...my shoulder howeverr is still aching....apparently it takes two weeks to get out of the system. I used the predictor tool here, to see if the statistics of the success of hormone therapy and statistically over the ten yrs.,...it does make quite a difference, so Im going to try another brand and hope it lessens these effects, if not Im just going to have to suck it up and be grateful to be alive/.                                     x",
