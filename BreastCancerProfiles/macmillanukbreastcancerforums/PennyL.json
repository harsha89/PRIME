      "Content": "Hi ladies, Oh yes, I\u2019d love to try making the healthy cookies too.  It only crossed my mind this morning to look for the April radiotherapy thread (doh)! Who said I\u2019m loosing my marbles! I have my 7th radiotherapy session today of 15 and so far so good. I\u2019m using the R1 and R2 creams and can highly recommend them. Even better if you can get them on prescription from your doctor as the 6 week course costs about £70. The RT team at Derby Royal are lovely and don\u2019t laugh at me when I wear a pair of gloves each day. Be warned ladies, that the machines are in rooms that have to be quite cool so hands above your head for as long as it takes do get chilly. The gloves really help! Love the mala photo. What considerate friends you have.",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, I\u2019ve had my profile name changed as the team thought that I might be using my actual name, which I wasn\u2019t, but hey ho! So, I was Penny Lane, but now I\u2019m PennyL - but I\u2019m actually Alison!!! I finished my rads last Wednesday and finally rang that bell! Yay! I felt very emotional leaving my tunic in the changing room. My tunic and I have been through it all together (and my gloves too, which I wore every day). I thought that all would return to \u201cnormal\u201d after radiotherapy, but I started to feel very anxious a couple of weeks ago and worried that I wasn\u2019t ready to return to work full time at the end of my sessions. My BCN rang me last Monday to see how I was getting on and I told her I was feeling quite overwhelmed at work so she asked me to go and see her the following day. When I did she explained that whilst I had accepted my diagnosis calmly and been through surgery, returned to work four weeks later, had radiotherapy and looked to all that I was coping well - I hadn\u2019t taken any time to deal with all this s##t EMOTIONALLY.  I\u2019ve now been signed off work for a month and whilst it\u2019s a shock and I see it as a failure on my part, I now need to reflect on what this has all actually meant for me. Just me! We all worry about trying to cope with our loved ones and trying to carry on with all the normal day to day stuff that we always do, but we all need to do this FOR OURSELVES. I\u2019m certainly no expert on this and it will be a strange time for me, but I\u2019m taking this on board. I\u2019m going to attend some Macmillan courses, which are free to all, and seek out mindfulness information and begin yoga, which I\u2019ve always wanted to try, but never felt as though I had the time. I\u2019m going to ask myself \u201cwhat can I do today to make me happy?\u201d I\u2019m going to look after ME! I wanted to share these thoughts with you as I hope my setback might help you to not experience this. Be kind to yourself. Take time to really think. Give yourself a hug. You\u2019ve been through a huge traumatic experience. You and I will feel yourself again very soon, we just need to give ourselves time xxx",

      "Content": "Hi @Queenfisher Thank you so much for sharing your situation. Whilst I am very sorry to hear that you have hit your own wall, it is comforting to know that we are not alone in feeling this way. I too had family, friends and colleagues telling me that \u201cyou\u2019re such a strong person\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re doing so well\u201d which is lovely to hear that everyone thinks that of you, but inside, it seems that we are crumbing. I don\u2019t think that you need to take anything further on at the moment with  a support group at your workplace and you must not feel guilty about not doing it at this time. It may be something that you can set up in the future, but definitely not now. You\u2019ve got enough on right now - dealing with yourself. My BC nurse told me that generally, people who \u201cfall apart\u201d (her words) at their diagnosis fair better after their treatment. Those who (like me) take it in calmly, in shock, are far more likely not to deal with their emotions and it then bottles up and bites us on the bum later down the line!! I\u2019m sure that is just a generalisation, but thought provoking! I will hopefully see a counsellor soon. I hope that the questions that they ask me will release answers from me that can help me move forward. I went to my first yoga class this morning and it was brilliant! It was a small group for beginners and concentrating on my breathing and the positions truly helped me stop thinking about anything else. Genuine \u201cme\u201d time. What a tonic and a totally new experience. One step forward. Thank you so much for your good wishes and supportive words. I hope that you too (and all that read this post) can take that much needed time for yourself.",

I\u2019ve had the results of my surgery, which, thankfully, were clear margins and no spread to the nodes, so you think to yourself - why do I need any radiotherapy? But I will definitely be having it. I don\u2019t want to risk any little blighters sneaking anywhere else! Come on lady - you can do this! You need a distraction - check out a thread called \u201cwalking back to happiness\u201d on here. Just a bunch of us posting our attempts to improve our days by getting outside. You don\u2019t have to join in, of course, but check out the photos and look at the comments of how it is improving how we feel. Helping us cope with life at the moment. Join us, when you are able.

Looks like they were taken on 2 different days, but one had the sun out and the other must have been when it clouded over.  The sea was like a pond - never seen it like that before. How are you clever ladies tagging us? I can\u2019t find how to do it! Help muchly appreciated! Aspen, I hope that you talk to a few close relatives or friends about how you feel. No need to keep things to yourself to protect them - you need them now. I\u2019m sure if the boot was on the other foot you would want to be there for them - if you don\u2019t ask for their support in your lows then you won\u2019t be able to share your highs - which I hope you will enjoy some time very soon.

      "Content": "Hi all, Now, all this walking is making my hair very knotty, due to the wind and the hat that I\u2019m wearing. So to get round this I am having to wear my hair in plaits! Which is fine, but making me look rather silly, as I\u2019m 57. Am I risking a case of Pocahontas-itis?? I am trying to avoid this as I already have swishy trousers syndrome from wearing my waterproof trousers. Have a good day everyone. mrsox - how are you feeling after your first chemo? Hope you\u2019re ok xx",

I hope that you have friends and family nearby that you can share how you feel and to take you out for a little lunch or a jaunt In the car. If you stay home all the time it\u2019s bound to affect you are feeling. We must work together to raise your mood and get you back out there more. I too, am loving this thread. When I\u2019m out for a walk I\u2019m looking for \u201cthe view\u201d that I want to share with you all. I haven\u2019t told anyone that I\u2019m writing on here. You are all my secret. My allies, because you know exactly how I\u2019m feeling, what I\u2019m experiencing, how to cheer me up and how to pick me up when I\u2019m down. I don\u2019t want anyone that I know in the \u201coutside world\u201d to be looking for me on here - to know what I\u2019ve written or see the photos that I\u2019ve shared with you - these are just for you. In our little supportive bubble. Happy Sunday everyone. Hope your day is a good one. One step at a time.",

But I\u2019ve only just realised that you\u2019re Mrs Ox!! Lol! So sorry (different \u201cvoice\u201d in my head from this moment onwards!!) Next walk out for us in our week in Wales, was to Pwllheli today, a walk along the cardigan bay. It was a lovely sunny day, but there was snow on the hills in the distance.  Pub lunch and then back to our cottage for my husband to watch the rugby (yawn). Time for a bath I think!",

Well here goes.... again... sorry if some bits relate to fridays posts. Hi all @toxophilite Hell yes, of course all those stairs count! @Cannon What a great incentive! I need to get one of those! @whathappened I too, look to this thread for motivation, but if you are tired, then give into it. This is not a race and there\u2019s always tomorrow (which might not be tomorrow, but will follow some time very soon) (tagging is not working this morning - it was, when I first typed this, but then I clicked off the site to look for photos and when I came back, all that I had written had disappeared so I\u2019ve had to start again and now it\u2019s not working!!) note to self to do what @leolady does and type in word first! I didn\u2019t go for a walk yesterday (Friday) as we were packing up to travel home. Arrived home at 6pm and brought my case upstairs. It was strange to see my \u201cnormal bed\u201d a place where I have cried alone over these past few weeks. A place where I have laid awake in the night and worried what the future had in store for me. Bit of a surprise, as I hadn\u2019t expected that. Here are a couple of pics from our journey home through Snowdonia. So beautiful. If you ever get the chance to go there, then do!",

How are you going to fasten it to your face? A pretty ribbon, blu tac? I can\u2019t help getting a vision of what\u2019s his name from silence of the lambs - Anthony Hopkins, so perhaps make one with a flower design on it to stop you looking like him.  I did make it out today: blue sky, sun out and evidence that spring is on its way. YAY!! This shot was taken in my local park.",

Not posted for a few days, but I\u2019ve been keeping up with the thread as my bedtime reading - you mad lot. I\u2019ve been to stay with my older daughter in Liverpool for a couple of days, driven by younger daughter.  It was lovely to spend quality time with them both. We did lots of walking, some in parks and some round the shops. I enjoyed every moment.  Back home now and worrying about being off work / returning to work / do I feel ready? Generally beating myself up. Been off for 4 weeks so far, which in the grand scheme of things, isn\u2019t that long, is it? I would LOVE to meet up with you crazy lot and give actual gentle hugs. lots of love xx",
