    "Content": "Hi my sister had breast cancer 6 yrs ago, had lumpectomy/radiation and tamoxofen. Was discharged last december from Oncologist stopped tamoxofen, to have yearly mamograms. She developed lymphodema early this year, and looking back was very tired. In may she discovered a hard lump in her neck, after biopsies she was told this was from her breast cancer - this was in July. Her Oncologist wanted second opinion from ENT as the tumor was in her neck. She also had a rash over her breast which she was given antibiotics for, During the time of waiting for all of these investigations, my sisters appearance began to change her neck started swelling, and both breast where now covered in an angry rash which was going into her neck, her neck felt ridgid. My sister at this point was so very depressed and scared. (she is now on antidepressants which have calmed her) When we returned to the Oncologist, he was extremely alarmed by her rash and induration as he called it in her neck, he organised for her to start EC chemo the following week, telling her the rash was cancer that it had migrated to her neck .Since this time, we have been told nothing else, the Oncologist I think has picked up on the fact that my sister is just too distressed to hear anything. She is having scans next week and seeing the oncologist on the 9th and having her 6th chemo. She says to me \"have you read of anyone else being a freak like me\" it has been so hard to see my bubbly sister in this state, After chemo her rash and neck are much worse, which the oncologist seems ok with then it settles down and improves. both of her breast are swollen. Has anyone else had this?",
