      "Content": "Hi Jackie hopefully by now you will have had your first chemo experience and found it not as bad as you feared.  i had round five of six yesterday and at the outset my greatest fear was that I would become ill and in need of an ambulance.  as i live alone I worried so much about whether i would be able to do that!  thankfully I have been ok, only one scary episode which soon passed.  I have so far not experienced some of the side effects, and,like Kipper, my nails are actually better and stronger than they were. I have learnt to listen to\" my team\" -which now includes medical people, friends old and new including those who have done this before, and, of course the people on here.  You've been given some great advice - I think prepare for what might happen but accept it might not.  Everyone is different.  Don't suffer in silence, apparantly everyone begins on the same drugs but these are adjusted.  Your medical team is there for you - so speak up - there is some amazing stuff availabe.  Another thing I did was keep a diary - making sure *I noted the positives.  looking back now its lovely to find something pleasant also happened. With your surgeries you have come through so much and you will find the strength to cope with this.  I see it as a bargain - the deal is a few weeks of feeling rough/exhausted to ensure more years of feeling great!  Text frm a friend yesterday who is five years down the line. \"get through this and the world is yours!\" a comforting thought!  finally - and I feel i've rambled on a bit - I was struck by the way you said I can't do this and immediatley several voices shouted back,pantomime style OH YES YOU CAN! which struck me as typical of this topsy turvy, strange, sad, uplifiting, crazy world we are in. take care and let us know how you get on, xx",

I havent been to work since - I was advised to take the time off.  I am amazed that some of you have carried on working during treatment as I know I could not have coped mainly because of being so tired all the time! I have been in touch informally with colleagues/the union but so far nothing officially about what to expect.  Thank you Karen - I had not realised about the Disability Discrimination Act either, E x",

My BC nurse said they had had a meeting and the treatment will be mastectomy with immediate reconstruction - does any one know what will be offered at this stage?  Is it a good thing?  How much longer does it take?  Going for CT and Bone scans on Friday, holding it together on the face of it but have to say underneath I am seething and terrified.  have done all I can to keep this thing away, lost weight, taken up exercise, changed diet, cut down on alcohol and just  don't understand. Any insights would be much appreciated.  Thanks - Barbs",

Now I have the scans to face on Friday - terrified of what more might be found.  As for having a big operation - I can't even think about that without having a meltdown. I am absolutely terrified of the operation, part of me thinks don't bother with reconstruction just get it over with - then again, should I have it done all in one go? Has anyone reading this made that decision and what did they go for? Probably too many questions for one post - I dare say it will take a while to get the hang of all this again. thanks for reading this, warmest wishes, B x",

      "Content": "Hi Kargus - sorry you're feeling miserable.  Your last sentence really struck a chord as about 12 months ago I found a lump which was diagnosed as BC in June - op in July, followed by chemo and radiotherapy.  I think I spent the first few weeks in shock, wanting an answer to the question \"why?\" and feeling I must have done something terrible because it was some form of punishment.  My rock bottom came the day before my op - of which I was terrified - when my daughter and I met friends for a meal.  I can't remember what I said (something bleak/gloomy) but I can remember each of them took me to one side and told me in no uncertain terms to sort myself out and one even said if she heard me talking like that again she would hit me!  I didn't like it at the time but gradually I came to realise that the only control I had was how I dealt with things and for my own sake and the sake of those around me I needed a different attitude.  I went along to support groups, read positive thinking books - I'd already come across Susan Jeffers - Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway so I read similar books/websites.  I tried to immerse myself in all things positive, tried downloading meditation/hypnosis/relaxation stuff and  as others here have done,  found Candy Crush - which provided a few minutes of escape from thinking about \"it\".  .  I met some wonderful people - found this site - and came to realise that we were not all horrible people who had done something wrong! A friend sent me a lovely card which said I would \"find a way through\" - I kept thinking about that and eventually I felt the misery clearing.  The chemo was unpleasant to say the least but I saw it as something that was helping me and was grateful for the treatment I was being given and for the expertise of the medical team.  I didn't bother with the cold cap - didn't want to extend the time I was there and though I was horrified at first adopted the attitude that it was only hair and it would grow back.  It's a bumpy ride - but like my friend said, you also will find a way through - and you might not believe it now but there will be good things along with way.  let me know if I can help. Good luck xx",
