    "Content": "Its 2 years since I was diagnosed with invasive ductal and lobular cancer. I had mastectomy and axillary clearance, radiotherapy but declined chemo. Overall I am doing great. During all this time I have never met another mastectomy patient. Can anyone offer any advise on peripheral pain in ribs and back which I am still experiencing? Can anyone offer hope that it will go away at some point? Also I am looking for tips on how to relieve muscle spasm caused by the latissimus dorsi reconstruction.  ",
