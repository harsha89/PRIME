      "Content": "Hi Gillian I was diagnosed with breast cancer in February 2015 and had mastectomy and chemo. Like you I had prolonged cough (this time last year) which just wouldn\u2019t clear up. Urgent chest X-ray (done same day as my GP visit but took 6weeks to be reported on...ha ha!) showed I had atelactesis and hyperinflation, then a follow up CT scan showed a \u201cnodule \u201c in one lung as well. I was totally panic stricken....but my oncologist wasnt too worried.  He said the nodule didn\u2019t look sinister and the atelactesis was probably the result of all the anaesthetics I\u2019d had the previous year. So I\u2019ve had two more CT scans to check the nodule which has remained unchanged and then as the cough has persisted ive been seen by a respiratory specialist. He\u2019s done a bronchoscopy which was largely unremarkable and he thinks I\u2019ve essentially developed asthma as a result of the EC part of my chemo.  So, try not to panic too much. All the best Gilly xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Maggs I've been taking aromatase inhibitors since January 2016 following mastectomy and chemotherapy in 2015. I started on letrozole - tried several brands (including Femara) and then swapped to anastrozole - tried several generics and am now on Arimidex- all in an effort to minimise side effects. Joint pain and stiffness and muscle pain and weakness are the worst to deal with and I'm not convinced that any of the AIs I've tried have been better or worse.  I've gone from a reasonably fit and very active woman with loads of energy to a completely knackered old bird!  I have to pace myself at everything physical which I attempt. I swim, walk and do yoga regularly but don't really enjoy any of them any more because of the pain. My left hip (which was a little stiff before the cancer) is horribly painful all the time and wakes me at night when I move. My ankles and shoulders are painful and the small joints in my fingers and toes cause me lots of trouble. The pain in my right wrist takes turns with my hip to make me shout at night. I went \"cold turkey\" to get myself off the very strong painkillers (oxynorm) which my GP was happy to continue to prescribe and that was really difficult. I was dependent on them but as they did little to relieve the pain I felt I would be more myself without them. I still take paracetamol/codeine and/or ibuprofen most days to try to help but am not sure they make a huge difference. I've tried various supplements to no avail although I've continued with fish oil capsules. I too have six monthly infusions of bisphosphanates. The only reason I continue is that my dear mum died of breast cancer which metastasised to her bones (amongst other places). The bone metastases caused her horrific pain and als a pathological fracture of her femur which was horrendous. I'm terrified of the same thing happening to me. I'm thinking of trying acupuncture for relief of the side effects- has anybody else any experience of this? Like you I don't want to live my life on painkillers. All the very best to you  Gilly PS For anyone just starting on AIs and being scared by all this, I should add that my friend who had breast cancer treatment at the same time as me has been on letrozole for over 18months now and has no joint or muscle pain whatsoever. So don't let our bad experiences put you off trying.",

It can be used repeatedly as the lice can't become resistant to it like they do with poisons. As if you haven't enough to worry about! Good luck Gilly xx",

It's 9months since I finished chemo and I still can't taste many things properly. I couldn't stand anything ginger flavoured despite liking it pre chemo!  I liked my drinks iced- water alone tasted a bit weird and cranberry juice added to it really helped. Drinking through a fat straw helped too. I bought an insulated jug to keep iced water cold.  Little pots of custard and rice pudding (chilled) were a favourite and I had some forest fruits flavour fortisip drinks which went down ok.. Mashed potato with salty gravy.....scrambled egg on thin white toast It would seem that everyone is different so you just have to experiment a bit. I used Caphosol mouthwash regularly and favoured a mild, minty toothpaste.  Water melon and tinned apricots were my fruits of choice. I can still heave at the smell of bacon and haven't eaten it for over twelve months! Didn't drink any tea or coffee for a very long time. Couldn't face the thought of anything alcoholic.....still can't really....but life without bacon and alcohol is probably a good idea anyhow! It will come to an end and you will want to eat and drink again so just keep on keeping on! Hugs Gilly xx",

I'm like Lynn- started on letrozole but could barely get around the house -changed to anastrozole and was a bit better but still like a little old woman (I'm late 50's and formerly pretty fit). Read what Lynn had previously posted and persuaded my GP to give me branded Arimidex whereupon side effects diminished greatly (and some, like the persistent nausea and horrendous insomnia disappeared altogether). However GP was at great pains to tell me how much more expensive the branded sort is to the NHS (about £70 per month)- so will only prescribe on a monthly basis. Not sure how the funding works but she seemed to think she may be prevented from continuing to prescribe it. My oncologist doesn't seem convinced that branded vs generic makes a difference (but my breast care nurse does). Hope your  headache subsides and that you don't get any further problems.

      "Content": "Hi Ceecee I too am having the problems you describe - along with repeated urinary tract infection....all because of the lack of oestrogen caused by the anastrozole I'm taking. I've tried a whole range of preparations with varying degrees of success...Replens, Yes both water and oil based (oil based better), Sylk (the only one my GP will prescribe) and Premeno Duo ovules (Hyaluronic acid ovules) which are probably the best so far. With all these preparations it seems difficult to get the stuff to hang around very long in the right place so you often end up feeling like you've wet your pants!! My GP says she thinks a topical oestrogen cream would help the tissues in that region without much being absorbed systemically and is happy to prescribe it. I'm scared to use it as my tumours were oestrogen positive and I'm terrified of a recurrence. I discussed it yesterday at a follow up appointment with my surgeon and breast care nurse. My surgeon said he would be happy for me to use it intermittently as long as my oncologist agreed. Unfortunately he's away at present so I'm waiting for them to get back to me. There are a lot of us about with this problem so I really wish there was an answer. Feeling like you're wearing a barbed wire tampon inside knickers made of nettles is no fun! Good luck Gilly x",

      "Content": "Hi Rachmeister My story is a little like Kacang's...I had left skin sparing mastectomy with immediate implant and mesh reconstruction in February 2015. I was like a rabbit in the headlights after diagnosis and was terrified of being flat and lopsided so was sure I wanted the immediate reconstruction. It healed well initially but was terribly painful, heavy and much bigger than my other boob. I felt very disappointed that it looked and felt so awful but the surgeon seemed pleased and confident that it would settle down. It never did.  Surgery was followed by 6 months chemotherapy and the reconstruction got increasingly painful and began to become discoloured. I saw my original surgeon several times because of the pain and the \"bursting\" sensation I had (dismissed as having a low pain threshold!). Eventually,10 months after the initial surgery, the scar just gave way and out popped the mesh and loads of serous fluid. The relief was tremendous but it was terrifying to head to hospital with my bursted boob in a bath towel. The whole lot was removed as an emergency and I've been flat ever since. I have also changed my surgeon for follow up! No way could I countenance further reconstruction after all that! I wear a silicon falsie most of the time- it's ok for shape and weight . Can no longer wear very low cut tops obviously, but the reconstruction looked so bizarre that there would have been no way I would have anyway! I have a swim boob which is fine and wear a softie for my yoga class as that's more comfortable to lie face down on. The reconstruction felt just as false to me as a breast prosthesis does and was blooming painful all the time too (which the falsie isn't ). I felt I couldn't be properly active when I had it as I was always guarding the area around it as well as my shoulder. All that changed after it was removed and I can be as active as I like now. I don't want any more surgery or foreign materials inside my body if I can help it so I'll be staying flat. Good luck with whatever you decide to do. Love, Gilly xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Nikki I expect you've already made your decision about reconstruction or not but I thought I'd tell you my experience. I had mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using silicon implant and mesh in February 2015. It was trouble from the start, although initially my surgeon was very happy with how things healed and appeared. I hated it from the moment I woke from anaesthetic- it didn't look or feel like it belonged to me in any way. It was like an alien under my skin and caused me so much pain. I continued in very severe pain from it all through the six months of chemotherapy that followed surgery and after finishing that I ended up having the whole thing removed at the beginning of December 2015 (10 months after the initial surgery) when the scar ruptured and the mesh and implant began to be expelled. I don't want to scare you and I'm sure there are more people writing on the forum about reconstruction problems because the people who don't have problems are just out there getting on with life! I do think that I was like a rabbit in the headlights when my cancer was first diagnosed- terrified that I would die, terrified of being without a breast and terrified of all the treatments generally. I had no counselling and no opportunity to speak to anyone who had gone through an immediate reconstruction. With hindsight my surgeon was excessively keen on reconstructive surgery and very proud of his previous handiwork so definitely influenced me towards something that maybe shouldn't have been for me.  I do know that since I've got rid of the reconstruction my life has improved immeasurably. I no longer have pain and now have a full range of movement. Life in the lopsided lane works for me....although I am only a B cup so maybe that makes things easier.  I hope you feel comfortable and unpressured about whatever you decide to do....and whatever that decision is you can always change your mind down the line.  All the very best.

I've been taking them for 15 months now -started with letrozole and moved to anastrozole after about 4 months of being reduced to a creaky old woman with severe joint pain. I've tried many brands and settled with Arimidex (for as long as my GP will agree to prescribe it anyway) but I'm not the fit, active, optimistic person I was before and I blame the lack of oestrogen for most of that. I'm permanently knackered but can't sleep, joints are stiff and very painful, I've delevoped a large spare tyre where previously I had a waist, am easily reduced to tears and find the activities I used to enjoy (yoga and swimming especially) really difficult.......need I go on? So why am I still taking the damned stuff? Two reasons- firstly, I watched my dear mum die prematurely from metastatic breast cancer and a more ghastly demise I could not imagine. I don't want that for myself and I don't want to put my children through what I went through with her- also, my oncologist (who is definitely one to present his patients with treatment options) is very insistent that it's the best thing to do. However, I did read somewhere that it's not uncommon for women to give up on aromatase inhibitors because of the severity of their side effects making their lives a misery. Good luck on Wednesday- only you can make the decision to continue taking them or not. Love Gilly x",

Last year I had EC 3 weekly X 4 doses which made me horribly constipated, followed by paclitaxel weekly X 12 doses which after the third dose gave me the most horrendous diarrhoea and cramps. My oncologist reduced my dose slightly without effect and I was prescribed loperamide (Imodium) to take after every loose stool- I think up to 8 per day. A couple of times my chemo had to be postponed as the colitis had made me so ill and they did say that if I wanted I could stop after 9 rather than 12 doses. I really wanted to gets the maximum cancer zapping effect of the chemo so soldiered on. I took oxycodone and paracetamol for the pain and lived on a very low residue diet- mainly boiled rice, white fish and the occasional egg. I supplemented this with Fortisip drinks which your GP can prescribe- bought mine in bulk off the internet. I lost 2and half stone in three months and was pretty much housebound- only going out for hospital visits and always padded up as the diarrhoea was unpredictable, explosive and watery. It was all bloody miserable BUT my bowel made a speedy recovery once the chemo was finished and is ok now. Chemo can have some really brutal side effects and I really sympathise with you. Ask your medical and nursing team for the help you need and make sure you drink enough daily and get the best nutrition down you that you can. Don't worry about popping pills- it's only for a short time. All the very best to you Gilly xxx",

I had mastectomy with immediate reconstruction followed by chemotherapy then removal of the failed reconstruction. Then as I was beginning to look forward to taking some control of my life I was hit by the steamroller side effects of aromatase inhibitors. I too grieve for my healthy, active pre breast cancer life and replay the horrors of diagnosis, chemo and the \"Alien\" like moment when the implant and mesh popped through my skin! It was my husband who pointed out to me that I was like someone who had been through an accident or disaster and that I seemed to indeed have PTSD. I've definitely been in the bad place that you find yourself in now. I'm still angry that I got this disease and angry that I haven't \"coped\" better with it but at some point we've  got to be kind to ourselves  and give ourselves  a break. Yes, we do have to learn to cope with the \"new normal\" but it is ok to grieve for what you have lost. However,  don't waste today by spending too long ruminating about yesterday or tomorrow (easier said than done). All the other replies you've had have been sensible and kind.....those are the sort of people you need to surround yourself with (and try and have some fun as often as possible). I had some counselling whilst having chemo which was helpful at the time but I've found that since I've gained more benefit from the things I would previously have classed as \"mumbo jumbo\". Reiki, Theta healing (I know it's bonkers!!) and reflexology have helped me enormously. I go to a yoga class which is great- I'm not very good at the movement and postures but the group of women there are so supportive and hilarious that I always feel much better afterwards. I love singing and plucked up courage to join a community choir....learning different parts to sing in harmony leaves no room for any other rubbish in my head- it's almost like the effect that others get from meditation I think. Anyway, what I'm saying in my usual verbose way is..be kind to yourself, acknowledge that you've been dealt a rubbish hand and then find some ways to enjoy the life you have.  This forum is a good place to get info and support...you are not alone and you will be able to get through this and enjoy life again.

      "Content": "What a difficult dilemma for you all. As you will have gathered from the responses so far, everyone has different and individual responses to and side effects from chemo.  When I had paclitaxel (similar to what your mum is having) this was given following EC chemo (epirubicin & cyclophosphamide) and all the nurses said that most people find it the easier of the two regimes to tolerate. It was the opposite for me and gave me really bad side effects - the worst was absolutely uncontrollable diarrhoea. I lost 2 and half stone in 12 weeks and seldom strayed further than a few yards from a loo despite being on maximum doses of loperamide. I lived on boiled rice and fortisip drinks and it was a really miserable time. I missed my daughter's graduation as a result and no way could I have attended a wedding. I looked and felt absolutely ghastly and hadn't got any energy at all. The effects of chemo are cumulative so I was worse after each treatment. My friend having exactly the same stuff at the same time had no gastrointestinal effects to speak of but quickly lost toe and fingernails and struggled to wear shoes and walk properly for a while. Not great if you're wanting to dress up in finery for a wedding! So I think you need to be guided by your mum- if she's lucky and has manageable side effects then she may feel she can \"go for it\" and it may give her purpose and help her power on through. If she should be too ill when it comes to it though it would be sad if she couldn't manage it. I think given my experience I'd be tempted to postpone.  All my very best wishes to you all. Gilly xxx",

      "Content": "No great solutions for you I'm afraid. I had a left mastectomy 18 months ago (C cup) and still have a \"travelling\" prosthesis...i.e..the falsie moves towards the real breast constantly. I've tried several different bras and falsies and found the best to be the heavier silicon one rather than the more comfortable softy. The best bra is an M&S one without wires and with a preformed cup. Like you I've found V necks more of a problem so have given up on them. I often drape a scarf over whatever I'm wearing so hopefully any \"falsie drift\" is less noticeable!  My problem seems compounded by the fact that my mastectomy looks like it was done with a giant ice cream scoop and I have quite a big concave area towards my right breast (where the cleavage used to be). All the prostheses I've seen are flat at the back where they rest against the chest wall and I could do with one that is more rugby ball shaped.  If anyone knows anywhere that makes custom built ones which might take this into account I'd be interested in hearing about it. Good luck. Gilly xx",

      "Content": "Hi there Yes, I paid for BRCA testing (and some other genetic stuff) privately a couple of years ago after my diagnosis of breast cancer. (Lobular, ductal and tubular - 4 tumours in one \"unstable\" breast). My mother died of breast cancer more than 20 years ago and her mother died in the late 1950's of either ovarian and/or uterine cancer.  The lovely geneticist who I consulted said in his opinion I should qualify for testing on the NHS with this family history but as my grandmother's death certificate stated \"carcinomatosis\" as cause of death rather than ovarian cancer I was excluded.  I was anxious to have this done as I have a daughter and clearly had I carried any relevant gene it could have impacted on her health. I can't remember the cost exactly - somewhere in the region of £500 I think. (And my private health insurance did not cover it either.) It transpired that I don't carry the gene but had I not been tested it would have been a terrible worry for me and her. Good luck Gilly",

Either they think you're going to fall off the twig imminently or \"I see you're completely back to normal now\" .....oh yeah, post treatment and full of hormone inhibitors and minus a boob...I feel just like I did before! However, I think mostly these things are said out of ignorance or just because they want you to be \"normal\" again because it's too scary for them to acknowledge how life changing cancer can be. Professionals should be better at this stuff but having been a nurse myself for 30years I know it's sometimes difficult to always be as sensitive as you would like.  I had a little instance of this today- went for my follow up with surgeon (12 months since finishing chemo/surgery etc) and when I had the mammogram the radiographer said \"you must be anxious today- if it was me I'd have had a double mastectomy just so as not to go through this worry every year\"- just what you want to hear as your boob is being sandwiched and zapped! I know she was trying to be kind by acknowledging my anxiety but it didn't help I can tell you! Good luck Gilly xx",

      "Content": "Hi Smiffy I've only just seen your post from yesterday. I hope you are feeling better but you should speak to your oncology hotline if the diarrhoea persists. They will want to ensure that you haven't any infection and that you're not getting dehydrated. I don't know which chemo you're having but some can cause very severe diarrhoea in some people. I had chemo last year and was horribly constipated whilst having epirubicin and cyclophosphamide- then I went on to paclitaxel and after the first couple of doses (mine was given weekly for twelve weeks) I developed the most awful colitis which meant I was having painful diarrhoea about 10 -12 times per day. After ruling out infection I was given Imodium at the maximum dose- which I continued for the whole of the time I was having chemo. A couple of times the chemo had to be postponed as I wasn't well enough to have it and the dose was reduced towards the end of treatment. I lived on boiled rice and fortisip for weeks- it was a bit bloody miserable but it did stop when I finished the paclitaxel.  When I needed to go to the hospital for appointments I wore an incontinence pad as I'd had a couple of \"mishaps\" at home. I never did disgrace myself anywhere but I do sympathise with you if you're having to go for a scan under those circumstances. Maybe you could call ahead to the department and explain your predicament- I'm sure they'd rather rush you through than make you suffer or risk you having an accident whilst waiting. The department where I was treated said the kind of reaction I had is pretty rare and usually in older very obese patients (neither of which I was). I hope your diarrhoea subsides soon. All my best wishes Gilly",

      "Content": "Hi there I was diagnosed in January 2015 following a routine mammogram (no symptoms at all) aged 57yrs. Had a mastectomy and chemotherapy- no radiotherapy as no positive nodes. I started on letrozole in January 2016 - tried several brands but was crippled with joint and muscle pain and stiffness by it. I changed to anastrozole, finally settling on Arimidex (for as long as my GP agrees to prescribe it) but I still feel like a creaky 90 yr old. It takes me a couple of hours to get going in the mornings, my sleep is disturbed by pain and im just not the woman i was before. I also have 6 monthly infusions of Zometa (bisphosphanate)- my oncologist recommends I have 6 in total...I've had 4 so far. I recently had a follow up appointment with my surgeon who seems a bit more concerned with quality of life than my oncologist and he said that after 2 years on an aromatase inhibitor it would be ok for a post menopausal woman like me to have tamoxifen instead as it's associated far less with severe joint pain. He said he would discuss me with my oncologist and we could talk about it next year. He also seemed to think that the Zometa could well be responsible for some of my pains (my husband says I'm much worse for about 8 to 10 weeks after each infusion) although I was told that the worst I could expect from it was some transient flu like symptoms after each infusion. (Apart from the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw...argh!!) He also said that it's beginning to be thought that the joint and muscle pains which some of us have in response to AI's is due to our genetic makeup (I'd read this somewhere too about side effects of  statins). I think,as someone else said, that those of us with severe side effects are probably over represented on this forum purely because we're constantly searching for some relief! My friend who had breast cancer at the same time as me now takes letrozole without having any aches or pains at all -so there must be plenty of women who are ok on AI's. I'm a bit worried about changing to tamoxifen as like you I'd thought that this was now only given to pre menopausal women, but I'm not keen to have my life blighted in this way if there is an effective alternative. Good luck with whatever you decide to do and if there's anyone out there with any more relevant info I'd be pleased to hear it. Sorry for the giant essay! Gilly x",

      "Content": "Hi Jen I had all my chemo through a portacath last year without any trouble whatsoever, my veins are difficult to access and I was advised that the portacath would be much less troublesome/painful. I had 4 lots of EC followed by 12 Paclitaxel. I had an echocardiogram both before and after chemo. I did have an episode of prolonged tachycardia shortly after the insertion of the line (they double checked the position of it) which was unexplained but never happened again. When the EC chemo was given it was always delivered slowly by hand rather than through an infusion counter and it was then followed by a flush of IV saline (about 1litre I think) given through the infusion machine. I was, like you, very concerned about damage to my heart and blood vessels but all has been well. Be reassured that lots of us have had this stuff through a portacath without problem. Your team will be experienced with it and able to look out for any problems. It's a really difficult time for you and I truly understand the anxieties that will be plaguing you just now, as well as the revolting side effects that you may be dealing with. Good luck, it will all be done with soon! All the best Gilly xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jules Sorry to hear of your problems with anastrozole. I haven't any answers except to say that like several others have posted, this seems to be very much down to our individual make up.  I started letrozole just after Christmas 2015 and for the first few weeks seemed ok but eventually developed such severe joint and muscle pains I could hardly get out of a chair. I got very depressed feeling that here was a drug that is supposed to be saving my life and it was turning me into a chair bound geriatric. I tried several different brands to no avail. My oncologist told me to stop it for a week and then start anastrozole as some people tolerate one better than another. I've been taking anastrozole for 6 weeks now and though I'm nothing like \"normal\" for me I am considerably better than I was on letrozole.  It seems very unfair that some people don't seem to have much in the way of side effects from these drugs whilst others are really laid low by them. But as all of us in this gang know, life is not fair!  I hope you get on better with the tamoxifen and then the letrozole but do keep speaking to your oncologist until you get something you feel you can tolerate. I feel I want to keep taking the anastrozole if I possibly can as I want to do everything I can to prevent recurrence. If this means I have to accept a new \"normal\" then I'll try to do that. My stiffness and joint pain is better if I move regularly so I'm trying to do more sensible exercise and I take regular analgesia. Good luck Gilly",

Whilst I was having chemo they were much worse and towards the end of the treatment I had a vitreous detachment which I was told was not likely to be associated with the chemo but more to do with my myopia. Seemed strange to me that it occurred during chemo though. I'm now on anastrozole (having been unable to tolerate letrozole) and still have really noticeable floaters- especially bad in the eye that had the vitreous detachment.  My sight has deteriorated a little since having all the treatment and the floaters are a constant irritant.  Still, a small niggle in the great scheme of things I suppose!
