I actually feel emotional for you as my run of things sounds the same as yours and I've been thinking about just the same post treatment toughts. I'm approaching FEC cycle 4 and the end seems insight now as Christmas and new year will soon be here, then rads. I was trying to plan return to work and the ifs and buts of post treatment recovery, in the night! Probably unrealistically I imagine I'll be back to normal a month after its all completed . I guess we have to let our bodies recover from the huge insult its undergone. You sound so positive and I too look on the bright side and spend a lot of the time reassuring everyone else! This will change all our lives forever, but I do feel weirdly, in a good way. I'm planning reduced working hours (I'll just spend less), to go to a festival, take more time and enjoy the things I love doing. We're so lucky to be alive :) Congratulations and happy recovery - how ever long it takes xxx",

There's always other stuff to worry about, which makes coping with the various treatments, side-effects and feelings a bit harder to deal with positively. Final treatment hurdle done though, now time for recovery of mind body and soul. Be kind to yourself My final zap this afternoon. I'm not sure how to feel other than a bit broken. What a long journey for us all. My (female) surgeon told me in August that we are the warriors, the strong ones and the mothers of men. I have held that thought throughout, especially in times of doubt and thinking I couldn't go on. I've enrolled on a 4 week 'Moving Forward' course, run by breast cancer care, to help with getting my life back on track. Good luck and love to all of you going through this xxxxx",

Whats your management plan, whats your regimen, how many hours can you work, how will you feel, when does your hair fall out, have you been to look at wigs? Arghhhh no!!!! Well today I found out the chemo starts on Monday next week and I'm seeing the oncology nurse this Friday (after numerous telephone calls to various depts).

You know, you're right, I think it will be liberating and exciting to see how it grows back.
