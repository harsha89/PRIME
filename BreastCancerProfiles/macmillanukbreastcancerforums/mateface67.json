      "Content": "Hi Lynne. It is now nearly htree weeks since my first FEC dose and I too have this burning sensation on the top of my head. I'm sure it's to do with the hair follicles loosening or something because my hair is beginning to fall out now. Found a great website called suburbanturbans which do really chic headgear.Good luck with the treatment, Jo Sherriff",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, This is my first post although I've been following all the threads and have taken real comfort from the ladies on this site. I was diagnosed the beginning of February with a 2.5 tumour. Like you my first thoughts were for my children aged 8 and 11 and wondering whether I would live to see them grow up. I can really identify with what you said about only hearing the word cancer and the rest being a blur. You will be able to take more in as the days pass but if you're anything like me I could not cope with too much info at first. Like you I am having the chemo first - 4 FEC and then 4 taxotere then the mastectomy. The idea of having the chemo first is to stop the risk of spread. Are they going to do an MRI to get a fuller picture? Will be thinking of you and keep us posted, Mateface67",
