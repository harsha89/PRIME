      "Content": "Hi Yes I've got a magnet and I bought it last Summer. As there are 2 types, I bought the expensive one as it is supposed to help heightened anxiety as well as the hot flushes. I'm not so convinced about the anxiety but I do feel that the hot flushes have eased even though I do still get them. I appreciate that there could be a placebo effect here but I wouldn't be without it.",

      "Content": "Absolutely. See how it goes. I do wear it all the time and have to say yes I do get flushes but they are quick and certainly not as horrendous as other people experience. I don't really sweat in the day or night and the moment passes very quickly. Good luck with it",
