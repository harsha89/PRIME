      "Content": "Hey Gill, I too was diagnosed in September, had lumpectomy, chemo and finished my radiotherapy last week, I'm 41.    I was worried about the radiotherapy as well but it was honestly easy peasy!!  I have a wee bit of redness and itchiness but apart from that feel totally fine, almost back to my old self again!!  Try not to worry about the radiotherapy, it's a breeze after chemo!!  I started on tamoxifen at the same time as the RT, been having some hot flushes but nothing I cant cope with, when i asked about this I was told that they should calm down after a few months, I think it will be easier when I'm not wearing anything on my head??!!  The marking up takes a bit of time just because they have to get you in the exact correct position and the actual 'mark' is just a pinprick so no need to worry about it!!   Like you I usually just read everyone elses comments on here and have found it to be a great support, only people going through cancer truly know how we are all feeling!! Hope it all goes well and straightforward for you, lots of love and luck Senga xx",
