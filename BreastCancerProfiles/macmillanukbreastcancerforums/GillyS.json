I have had 2 WLE and mastectomy and going through reconstruction, which I didn't think they would consider- but they did. I was pretty fit and busy on Granny duties a lot before this, I worked until I was 69 and only retired because my husband did. I always spoke my mind and asked about everything ( once the initial brain soup had cleared ). Remember that you have a whole team behind you as well as all the ladies here. I had useful feedback from woman of all ages. By coincidence , I too had a skin cancer, luckily it wasn't malignant and it was treated- right on my nose as well !

I started to get angry then, and the results from the second op showed that they still hadn't got the margin they wanted and would have to have a mastectomy, this was when I called a halt and asked for a couple of weeks to get my head around things and choose my own path with advice and a bit of research. I was also concerned because I was 70 at the time and wasn't sure that I would get the same treatment as a younger woman- but I was so wrong- everyone involved has been wonderful, patient, helpful and kind. When I saw them again I had decided to have the mastectomy ( to get rid of the disease) and reconstruction, hoping I could dodge rads and chemo..... and I got my wish. My reconctruction is complete and I didn't have to have the treatments that make people so ill, ( I feel like a bit of a lightweight compared with most of the ladies here) I haven't felt ill at all although the shock and the ' what ifs' have affected me a bit. This really was to reassure you that there can be a way through without having to have the meds that concern you. I hope it all works out for you. Love Gill x",
