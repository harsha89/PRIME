      "Content": "Hi KateG. Your explanation of what we go through really hit home I only wish that when I had breast cancer mastectomy chemo that I had someone to talk to I did not have a computer or lap top then so I did not know anyone who had had breast cancer. I did find my self slipping into depression and was very ill just the words you use made me feel yes that`s how I felt it would have helped me so much to have someone like you to talk to on line, I did not have Tamoxifen I think in them days they just tried different ways of treating it some where on it and some where not they never told me why not. Things where so different then no one seemed to know much about breast cancer I was given HRT by my Dr I only found out a lot further down the line he should have given me a blood test to check my hormone level HRT was new then so they thought it would cure everything there was so much on tv about it in the papers etc  everyone thought it was wonderful not for me though it changed my life forever my husband changed towards me he did not want to look at me any more I was no longer desirable!   I only went to the Drs because I was feeling tired all the time and he gave me HRT so you see they thought it was a wonder drug how many women have been given this in the past and Died! Thank you Kate for saying it like it is I was always made to feel I was making a fuss about nothing no comfort from my husband or my sister I feel tearful now just writing what it was like and how I was made to feel. Thank you Jeniren x",

Next time you have an appointment with who ever write down what you want to ask keep a pen and paper by your side then when anything comes into your head write it down.  Don`t be intimidated by them who ever they are you are in control of your life and your life is in their hand so you have to make sure you know what is happening step by step. I am sorry if this sounds aggressive I don`t mean to be I feel strongly about this because of the many mistakes that where made when I had bc and I would not let it happen again I really suffered and thats an understatement and yes they know more now than then medically and I know now I would ask as many question as I needed to for my own peace of mind. See what the bc nurse says tomorrow and take it from there and write every thing down. Let me know how you go on. Jeniren",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief I left  a post for cazza,  then I read yours oh I wish our time had been like yours.  My husband was awful to me when I had bc mx chemo,  I am not going to go on about it because at this time cazza needs all the support she can get.  My heart goes out to her it really does. What a wonderful couple you are, I love the saying because I think we do believe when we are treated badly we always seem to think it is our fault, I will remember that saying it fits my experience to a t.  My ex husband as treated me so badly when I had bc and beyond!!  We where married for 40yrs  I had children and at the time could not afford to leave him, I did eventually. Best wishes to you both treasure what you have, I am sure you do. Jeniren x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Cazza I am so sorry to hear about all that has happened,  especially about your husband.   Men can be so selfish and uncaring,  I had problems with my ex husband I never found out the truth,  he was dreadful when I had bc mx and chemo.   In fact he was vile to me and there are no excuses for being unfaithful or abusing someone,  he was dreadful when I was on chemo ( I had two young children then too) it was as though I was causing the problems.  I was so ill every 2 weeks as that`s how I had my chemo, and one day when I  was in bed because I felt so ill ( when you are on chemo your phoo and wind smell disgusting but you can`t help it)  he came into the bedroom and said it stinks in here, and through the curtains back, opened all the windows ( it was throwing  it down) and walked out of the room I won`t go on as you must be so upset and having c  with two children too. I wish I could say it will be ok but I can`t,  do you have a really good friend you can talk to,  Mistymoley might be able to help you if you accept her as a friend. Sweetheart I am sending you a BIG HUG. kind regards. Jeniren xx",

Ring your breast care nurse as soon as possible do not suffer in silence, if you do not get any answers then ring your consultants secretary, or ring the dept where you had your rads. Do you have anyone who can help you with this? Hope you find some relief from your pain. Kind regards  Jeniren ",

      "Content": "Hi RebaccaT Yes I have had a lot of problems with reconstruction,  I had mine quite a few years ago, and it also had a huge impact on my life and still does.  It changed me completely not only physical, emotional and very much my personality.  I have been thinking for a long time that I should have done something about it, and complained! I had max on my left breast, reconstruction three times, and had my right breast made smaller.  They made a mess also of my right breast, it was devastating as there wasn`t anything wrong with my right breast.  It still upsets me today some years on, I did not complain at the time has I had gone through so much, I could not take it anymore, and thought I could live withit but I can`t. I hate my breasts, most of all I hate my good breast, the fact they did not care, I was happy with the fact at least I had one breast that still looked good.  They took that away from me, by making it ugly, when there was nothing wrong with it except it was larger than my left reconstruction. I was wondering wether to go to one of though law firms who deal with medical negligence,  I will support you, I did appear on tv  just after I had my mx, that was before all this went wrong.  It was channel 4, they wanted women to talk about their experience with breast cancer.  I also did a newspaper interview that was published, and a magazine also did an article on me. I cannot write everything that happened on a post, If you do want to communicate you can make me a friend, and then we can express ourselves. Kind regards Jeniren",

Hope this helps in some way. Best wishes Jeniren",

Is there anyone you can stay with for support, while you are going through this.   Let me know what area you live in if it is near me I will come and see you, and your cat,everything will feel huge now that you could probably cope with when you were well.  Take care sweetheart.
