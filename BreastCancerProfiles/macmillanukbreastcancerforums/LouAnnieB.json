    "Content": "Dear Maggie, My insurance company tired exactly the same thing with me 2 days before my mastectomy. Insist that they review all the calls (they should have been taped) and argue strongly that they would have enough time to inform you but that one day prior to surgery. As long as you had called in and they have you an authorisation code - THEY CANNOT take it back. This were instructing me to change my consultant two days prior to surgery, AFTER I was given a clearance code, and AFTER I had been in touch just about every two days. I copied everything in my complaint to the ombudsman and insisted that (this took many many hours) that they review the matierial and cover the charges. if the error was theirs then they have a legal obligation to pay for it. What they CANNOT do is call you and back out. I know it takes a lot of energy to fight but please do. Stand your ground and demand to deal only with a manager. What has helped me is that I have documented calls very carefully and have had to challenge (and have won) on 3 occasions already - and I still am only at my 2nd fec treatment and still have radiation to go after my 7th cycle. What I find apalling is how many stories like ours appear over and over. Please accept my best wishes!",
