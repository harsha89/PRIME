      "Content": "I had a positive result from my 1st routine mammogram at 51. It was cancer cells which were removed, together with lymph nodes Then as was the norm in 2001 only 5 years tamoxafen. Cancer free for 16 years, the wham bang, routine mammogram between last xmas and new year and it is back. Not only that it is in exactly the same position as the one 16 years ago, sitting on the scar. Had to have mastectomy. Couldn't check lymph nodes as they had all been taken in 2000. I couldn't have radiotherapy either as not possible to have it in same place twice.  Been put on Anastrozole  for however long, didn't really say. Been left up in the air about everything really, scar area is very lumpy and sore still after 10 months, but have to carry on regardless. My point is even tho we think we know lots about our bodies there is still probably a lot more we don't know than we do. ",

      "Content": "Hi Annie. I really don't know if radiotherapy can affect your teeth, I would have thought not unless the therapy actually touched your mouth and gums. But I will say that it is 16 years since I had my first bout of cancer and for the last 16 years if I have anything wrong with my body it has always seemed to be on the BC side. Purely coincidental I am sure, had a toooth out this afternoon, on the BC side!! I also take the same drug as you, didn't know about the dry mouth, must remember that. Take care and hope your dental problems get sorted Judy xx",
