      "Content": "Thanks Tilla,  I wonder if your stay ended up longer than the initial 36 hours you were told, because it was the weekend?  I have heard that some people go home with drains still in.  I would much prefer to stay in for a few days and definitely until after the drain is out.  Here\u2019s hoping.  Surgery is next Thursday early afternoon.  Blessings x",
