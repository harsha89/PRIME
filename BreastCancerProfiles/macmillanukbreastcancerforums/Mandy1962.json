      "Content": "I had surgery for breast cancer 6 weeks ago and I start chemo on Thursday. I am worried because the breast that was operated on has come out in a strange rash. My GP thought it was an infection and put me on antibiotics last week. Hasn't done a thing. If anything it is redder and is now starting to itch. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I am worried this may effect me starting chemo and I am already so nervous I don't know how I would cope if I have to wait any longer. I would be greatful of any advise anyone can offer",

      "Content": "Thank you Susan & Shady for answering. It does help to know that there is someone out there who knows what I am going through. I realise that It is out of my hands. That is probably the problem. I am going to try and get some sleep now. No doubt now I have found this forum I will be back tomorrow. Night Night all x",

      "Content": "Well what a strange day. Got myself mentally prepared only to be told I will have to wait until next week to start . I have an infection from the surgery and they want it to get a bit better before they give me chemo. In a strange way I feel dissapointed. Next week I will have to go through all that tension again. Thank you all so much for your kind words and support. Can you do it all again next week LOL ;) x",
