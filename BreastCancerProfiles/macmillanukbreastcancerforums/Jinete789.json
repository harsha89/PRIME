      "Content": "Hi Uzume Sorry I have been offline for a while - Had a dig and found the rather long document below. This relates to neo-adjuvant treatment so I am not sure if it is entirely relevant, but is quite good from the perspective of understanding lapatinib and how it fuctions. http://www.m3login.com/Content/E99FDD09-0391-4793-B2A2-A227AE1DD322/papers/Her2-Related_v2.pdf Meantime I have also discovered that I am HER2+, and have asked my onc about the ALLTO trial myself. Not decided though. Would be good to know what you decide. take care. Jin p.s. have you tried looking at http://www.her2support.com - as it's just for us \"HER2ers\" there is lots of very relevant info. Also it is US based, and there a lot of folks on it who are taking lapatinib for secondary bc so you can contact someone who is actually taking it. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Uzume - I work for the company which makes Lapatanib (GlaxoSmithKline) - its commercial name is Tyverb/Tykerb depending which country you are in, which might help you with googling. I am not sure how much information is on their external website but the email address is www.gsk.com. If you would like me to I can access some stuff internally - not sure how to get it to you though - guess I could cut and paste some stuff into the thread? Of course no info from a drugs company is going to be free of bias, and I have no interest in influencing your decision one way or another, but if it would help I would be happy to add whatever I can find to what you have already discovered. Let me know if this would help. Jinete",

I have only just started treatment last week and went for my bone scan today - Whilst I am still praying that the scan is negative, the fact that you folks are out there surviving even this on top of BC is heartening. apologies again for hi-jacking your thread.",
