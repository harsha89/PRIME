      "Content": "Hi racer. I finished my last of 4 EC on 28 June due to start taxol 24 July . I'm currently on my last day of a 10 day holiday in Spain. Onco gave me an extra week break so I could make my holiday. Pleased to say it has been a well needed break and no issues. I took an aspirin before the flight and wore flight socks also brought some antibiotics with me just in case but not needed them. Although mine was only a 2 hour flight I am still in active treatment so speak to your team. I'm sure it will be ok. Defo get good insurance though x",

      "Content": "Thank you Paula that gives me some hope that I might be able to get away. My injections are currently only for 7 days post EC so they shouldn't be an issue. Flying day 14 hopefully means no meds to take and touch wood at the end of my at risk period. I am hoping to fly from Exeter which is a tiny airport for a 2 hour flight. I don't plan to eat etc at airport just my ussual gallon of water to drink and my ted socks which I also wore when I flew 2 weeks post ANC.  The mask is something I will need to consider but to be honest they are bringing me in to hospital tomorrow for CT scan with dye injected (6 days post EC) I can't help but think hospital and injection at this point is a higher risk of infection than a small plane ?  I have an up to date EHIC card and will look at insurance if Onco sounds like it's doable. Maybe I'm sticking my head in the sand but 10 days self catering in a private villa in the warm surly can only do me some good and I get to spend some quality time with my teenage daughter and husband which is in short supply at the minute x",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn Thanks for the reply. So my 2nd of 4 EC was this Tuesday. 3rd is booked for 6 June ( my birthday yay ) which would put the 4 the on 27 June if all goes ok. I was admitted after 1 st with sepsis but WBC seemed to come back up pretty quickly so no delay so far.  My taxol is 12 X weekly but I wasn't sure if I would still get the 3 week break before Taxol ?? My holiday is booked for 11 July which would be day 14 post last EC so should be fine but it's a 10 day holiday which would make 24 days plus prob need to add a day for bloods.  I am putting off having the pic line in the hope I can still go.  It's a small hope but you have to hold on to some don't you x",

      "Content": "afternoon all. I was just wondering if anyone has had a break between EC and Taxol treatment. I was diagnosed in Jan had 2 ops including ANC now on 4 x EC due to be followed with 12 X T.  Before diagnosis we had booked a family holiday to Spain for 10 days.  If I go it will leave a 25 day gap between EC &T.  This will be the halfway point in chemo and I really want to go and think mentally it will help me get ready for second part of the journey. It already feels like a lifetime. Has anyone had or asked for a break between the 2 regimes ?? What do you think my chances are of getting Onco to agree ? ",

Have 4 weeks of EC ( not sure if this is same as FEC ??) this is spread over 12 weeks but then Taxol x 12 ( weekly)  I have noticed a lot of you are having much lower numbers of T ?? Anyone know why we have different doses. I had DCIS removed with clear margins and only 17 mm. 2/2 SNB positive but still waiting for results of AN clearance.  This is all very confusing ",
