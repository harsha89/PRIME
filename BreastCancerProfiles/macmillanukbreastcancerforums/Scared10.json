      "Content": "Hi just wondering if anyone had had experience of nodes left behind after ANC? Had mx and ANC in 31st July. Told grade 3 and 8 out of 24 nodes positive. clear margins but vascular invasion. Had clear CT and bone scan 2 weeks ago and due to start chemo this Friday. Today in bath I felt small pea shaped lump in lower arm pit. Going to ask BBC tomorrow but no panicking one has been left behind and it will delay chemo. Anyone else had this? x",

      "Content": "Hi I was recently diagnosed mid July with grade 3 IDC one node positive at scan and 25mm tumour. Mx and full ANC on 31st July and just got results yesterday. Actual size was 37mm grade 3 confirmed, ER positive 7 and her2 negative. 8 out of 24 nodes positive so now got CT scan and bone scan next Friday and results following Wednesday. Absolutely petrified that it has spread elsewhere and daren't think positive as every time I go seems to be more bad news and don't want to tempt fate. Every time I look at my two boys aged 11 and 14 I just want to burst into tears but trying to stay positive in front of them. Just wanted to hear from other people with similar experiences. Chemo and RT to follow after scans.",
