    "Content": "My wife was diagnosed two weeks ago with breast cancer. At first they thought it was a cyst but when they tried to drain it they found they could not. They took a biopsy and checked with ultrasound under the arm for lumps and there were none. One week later we returned and they told us it was a tumor, they checked under the arm again and found one lymph node swollen which had appeared in one week, a biopsy was taken of this and they found cancer cells. They told us the best way to treat this is with chemo first which my wife starts on Thursday and then the operation. I am amazed at how strong she is and the determination she has to beat it. I love her so much and I feel so hopeless as I can do nothing to make it better for her. Am so worried now and I am finding it difficult to cope.",
