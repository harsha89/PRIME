It's an emotional rollercoaster, you will eventually achieve days when the cancer is not your first thought. But you are coping the best way for you. Tell them to take a hike:) big hug Ditzy XX",

I'm not on the chemo train yet, but my oncology nurse referred me to a gym run by the physio dept especially for cancer patients, exercise being recommended. There were various cancers all at different stages of different treatments, I know a normal gym is obviously different as we had the physio to advise us and support us. Good luck hope it goes well for you. Ditzy xxx",
