    "Content": "Hello, My name is Alice and I am a breast cancer advocate working with the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer. I am attending their Westminster Fly-In next week as a member of their Campaign and Advocacy Network and will be specifically meeting Des Turner MP. So, I am very interested to hear from anyone who has been treated for breast cancer in the Brighton & Hove constituency about their experiences with the current breast cancer services. The two main campaigns this year are focussing on maintaining the 14 day waiting period for both urgent and non-urgent breast referrals, and on lymphoedema services. - I am keen to know if the waiting periods were met for patients? - I am also interested to know about peoples experiences with lyphoedema - was sufficient information delivered about the condition? - how satisfactory were the services/treatments? - Any other reflections on Brighton's breast cancer services would be very welcome and appreciated. All information will be kept entirely confidential and will be solely used for my campaign research before I meet to lobby MPs into maintaining and improving breast cancer services. I look forward to hearing back from anybody who wishes to share. Thanks, Alice :-)",
