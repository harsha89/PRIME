    "Content": "Just found your post ... This happened to me too after my bilateral diep reconstruction in 2014.... Had massive skin graft to close the wound and 8 weeks in hospital. However went back to work ...got used to the new me and now going in for more surgery to pull the wound together.....It was a big shock at the time to realise that something can go badly wrong but 18 months later I don't regret having it done. You are the only other person I've found who has had this problem and I think the complication is pretty rare..... Hang on and it does get easier.",
