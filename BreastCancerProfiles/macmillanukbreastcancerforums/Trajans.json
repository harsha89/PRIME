    "Content": "My first experience with fec was really bad, constant headache, couldn\u2019t stand bright lights or noise, I spent most of the time laid out when I wasn\u2019t throwing up. I also had a mouth full of ulcers which they wanted to hospitalise me over. I brought a load of treatments but they didn\u2019t re occur after the first dose of fec. I think I was unlucky as the throwing up lasted the full three weeks and I lost a lot of weight over the 6 doses. Even the medication to stop sickness made me throw up immediately after taking it. In the end they put it in the treatment and stopped the tablets. The first dose is the worst and the scariest mostly because you don\u2019t know what to expect. If you can put yourself to bed without being hassled you will cope with it.  Keep off fresh orange juice, I loved it but ended up hospitalised because of sickness and the runs and stomach pains, once I stopped drinking orange juice the condition improved tremendously, though it was by process of elimination not the hospitals advice. If you are on nhs, the worst thing will be the waiting times, in all my appointments I was only seen on time once, the longest wait being 3 hours.  Good luck, you do, will cope and get through it",
