      "Content": "I hope some one can give me some advice. I have had my results today of my Oncotype test. My results show i am in the intermediate risk for recurrence. I have to decide whether to have chemo or not. If i have chemo it will reduce my risk of recurrence by about 4% - i am not sure if it is really worth it for 41/2 months of chemo. At the moment it is 14 - 17% of coming back. Any thoughts and advice would be so appreciated.",
