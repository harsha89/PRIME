      "Content": "Hi Katrina, hope you found your energy, probably courtesy of the steroids. I hate those things although i know they stop me feeling sick, just hate not sleeping for nearly a week, its no wonder we get so tired. I must admit i sleep better in the chair watching TV than i do in bed, seems whenever i get there i just lay awake for hours on end. I do have some sleeping pills but i dont like taking them unless i get really warn out, they knock me out for 6 hours exactly then I'm awake again, no real side effects but my GP warned me they are addictive and i can imagine that they would be. I just keep thinking when its all over I will finally sleep, probably wont wake up for days!!  Hope the next few days wont be too bad for you, keep saying to yourself only one more time....I'm here next week then chemo 5 for me on the 23rd. Does anyone else have a chemo anthem?? I sing Elton John's I'm still standing really loudly as soon as I feel well enough to, really helps me feel I have beaten it again!! Teggielass x",

Know what you mean about dreading going into chemo, it really doesn't get any easier does it, in fact it does get harder because I feel sck everytime i think about tuesday coming, I guess this is what people mean by us being `brave'! I know the song that you mean, Nina Simone, and yes its a good one but believe me if I ever went on X Factor the pain I would cause would make chemo look like a walk in the park!! Must admit I have really enjoyed the last week, I have felt good and had a normalish life, I guess that makes it even harder to think about next week BUT I have worked out that I have about 6 days of feeling rubbish left, I have 20 jabs in the stomach to tolerate and 14 days of antibiotics to take, and I will be ticking each one off from next Tuesday.  Enjoy your next couple of weeks and I will talk again the other side of chemo 5!! Good luck to everyone else still going through it, keep the faith. Teggielass x",

      "Content": "Hi Katrina, found your views very interesting because I have just had my 4th lot of TAC and like you i found it so hard emotionally this time, lots of tears and I think its because everyone keeps telling me i have only have two more to go, but they still seem like a mountain to climb! I just keeping thinking that next time I can say to myself only one more to go, so bring it on, I'm getting mad now and feeling so rough and i want my life back. I have crashed with neutropenia three times now, not good because i just start to feel ok and bang I'm on my knees again BUT this time we are trying a new regime and I have been having daily jabs by the district nurses to get my bone marrow working and I am on antibiotics for ten days, so far so good but since i got up shivering today and threw up I am a bit scared, positive mental attitude is engaged.  I so want to just have a couple of good weeks where i can spend normal time with my daughter and grandaughter doing fun things. I'm impressed that you are going to the gym, I dont think i could manage that but i do walk my dogs once i feel well which is lovely particularly because we live in very rural wales and the snowdrops and daffodils are just coming up to herald spring and new life. I really wish you all the very best for the next two, I tell you what you think of me and I will think of you when the going gets tough and together we will get to the end, I've just sent invites out to all my freinds for my post chemo party on Easter Saturday before i head off for 6 weeks of radiotherapy to another part of Wales, sure that is going to be a walk in the park after all this, funny how we should think being radiated every day is ok but i guess thats the power of chemo!! Enjoy your good weeks... see you the other side xxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Katrina, sorry to hear you are aching, funny thing is that I've had a similar story since my number 5 but since I am having daily doses of neupogena to stop me crashing I've been putting it down to that. Every evening I start with the shivering and have to go off to bed and warm myself up then it eases and like you when i do try to go out for a little walk I feel like an old lady?  Perhaps this is what they call the cumulative effect but like you I hate to think how I will feel after number 6! Also like you I am dreading number 6, have thought about calling it a day but like you feel that I owe it to myself and my family to complete the course, after all this I would hate to fail at the final hurdle but I do think that I will need someone to push me through the door this time because I nearly got up and ran last time! Hold on to the fact that the good times will come again we just have to batton down the hatches one more time and I dont know about you but this time I intend to scream louder, cry more and let it all out, I've done with being courageous I want to revert back to being a whimp!!

      "Content": "LOL!! Love the idea of we are off for a suntan!! Can empathise with the night sweats, at times I have felt like I am inwardly going to combust with the heat and my husband and I have separate rooms for the first 10 ten days of every chemo hit to enable me to thrash around. I have tried drinking sage oil, spritzing with rose oil and to be honest not much really works.  I guess as a 48 year old with 3 grown children the only postive thing is that I had my last period over my first chemo which was not nice and i am told I wont be having anymore, so i condenced my menopause into 4 four months. Although a freind has warned me that the hot flushes can continue with the post treatment drugs..great! Know what you mean about dogs and staying still because i take my binoculars to do a spot of bird watching and mine are not always very co-operative. Good news is that every other session of chemo i have been admitted to hosptial by now neutropenic, in fact I normally dont have one while cell by now, and today i am fine, so the new regime seems to have worked, feels like a huge relief and I am now not so daunted by the last two. Sounds like you work for a really supportive company actually, and I wouldn;t be too quick to get back to work, be kind to yourself and let your body and mind heal first. Sadly i lost my job just after i started chemo, i was on a fixed term contract as a director of a local company and they took the opportunity to let me go rather than have me off sick for a while. Oh well I am looking at it as an opportunity to do something new and reduce my working hours, funny how we talk about getting our life back isn't it, maybe we will never have the old life back, perhaps its a time of rebirth and new life for us all.

For all of you still going through it, keep the faith, it's amazing how fast 3 weekly cycles can go.  I ran into one of my chemo nurses out over the weekend when i was out with freinds having a meal and she remarked how nice it was to see me laughing and having fun, she said they only get to see us when we are having chemo or when we are admitted afterwards crashed.

I guess like chemo we are all so different in how it effects us we just have to wait and see but as I've not had an easy ride through chemo, at least not the first 3 lots where i was neutropenic each time all needing admission for treatment, that just have to believe that radio will be easier. I have my first consultation on he 9th march so i will ask all the right questions now I hope and then should start treatment just after easter, all treatment should be over by the end of may and then i intend to sit back and enjoy what ever summer we actually do have!

      "Content": "Hi Honey49, I was diagnosed with BC stage 3 in october, i had a mastectomy and 38 diseased lymph nodes were removed from under my arm and up near my neck. I have gone on to have 6 chemo sessions of TAC, about to have my last one next tuesday and then I am going on to have 3 weeks of radiotherapy followed by some hormone treatment for 5 years, probably tamoxifen. I have been told that I will be zapped in radio under my arm, on my chest and lower neck because of the number of lymph nodes that were diseased. I have also been told that going under my arm will increase the risk of me getting lymphodeamia, which i had before the op because of the tumour under my arm. To combat this the lymphodeamia clinic are putting a pressure bandage on me for a couple of weeks before the radiotherapy begins and i have to keep it on during the treatment a for a while after it. This combined with the normal exercise, lymphatic drainage which I've been shown to do (dont worry its a kind of gentle massage nothing surgical!) and good skin care I hope to control the lymphodaemia as much as I can. I've also just bought a swimming boob and a new swim costume to do some swimming after chemo finishes and i feel up to it, been told it will help with the effects of radiotherapy. I know you will be worried I was shocked when I came round from my op to find out how many they had taken but the scans showed that it had not spread so I hope you get the same result. Let me know how you get on, and for now get some rest if you can and do any exercises they gave you to keep your arm moving, they really do work if you do them regularly. Teggielass  ",

I also had 38 lymph nodes taken out so a bit sore but trying to be positive. I have 3 children, a husband, one grandchild, a dad and lots of brothers and sisters, and freinds and THE worst part of all this is seeing them sad and worried. When ever I've had to tell them results or when they came to see me after my operation seeing their distress was soooo hard. So i guess your daughter may just be hiding her own distress to seem strong for her husband why not give her a chance to let her own feelings out with just you, she may feel that she has to be stiff upper lip?  I had to shout at my husband in the end to get him to let it all out because i knew he was hurting and we couldn't go on not being honest with each other. Most of my freinds and family have been great BUT i have had one freind who has just turned her back on me, which has hurt and upset my other freinds but she just cant deal with this. some people just cant.

My husband tells me its time to let it all out and I thnk he's right, we have to be so brave to live with this flipping disease that from time to time we need to scream, shout and cry at the injustice of it all so moan away my freind because today I am right with you!

Will put in more physio before I start to give it a hand.  They have also fitted me for a compression sleeve because of the level of radium I will have in 3 places because according to them i am at high risk of lymphodaemia, which is not good but hopefully i can overcome it.

I have a cruise booked for end of november because I wanted to give myself 6 months after my chemo and radiotherapy to recover befor I went away, that and the fact that I didnt want to get hit by high medical insurance whilst on treatment.  Bought a swimming costume from Nicola Jane which is sun protective and will hold by waterproof boob, also bought from that company. Hoping that the radiotherapy wont leave any scarring. I have my chemo party booked for next weekend, bought 6 chinese lanterns to let off to reflect the 6 chemo sessions, out with the negative energy and in with the positive, made a playlist of real anthem music for everyone to sing along too and I am sure that i will be drunk as a skunk after one G&T since I haven't drunk for 8 months now!!

      "Content": "Hi Oldhat, I'm about to start radiotherapy on the 19th april after 6 lots of chemo a mastectomy etc, like you in between chemo I just wanted to eat all the time, particularly cream cakes  but I guessed that one occassionally would not kill me and I still managed to drop two dress sizes, my view was that I didnt eat for ten days in every 3 weeks so the rest of the time i needed to store energy! I am not having reconstruction, I simply cant face anymore ops and I think Im a bit of a coward when it comes to purposefully putting myself through more pain. I have a prothesis from the hospital that i wear for best, its quite heavy and can be hot, but I also bought a waterproof one to wear swimminig from Nicola Jane and that is much lighter and I wear it most of the time now.  I invested in a couple of bras with pockets from Amoena on line which are good BUT beware I found I needed a size larger than my normal size and didnt do this so had to buy bra extensions that have worked ok. This is because of the scare tissue left on my side from the mastectomy.  I dont find  they ride up because they sit in the pocket, biggest problem can be remembering to put it in because if Im just around the house i dont put it in and often find myself going out and my hubby reminding im boobless! Hope you find what you need but check out Nicola Jane on line for ideas they have a good range of boobs. Teggielass.    ",

      "Content": "Hi Katrina, and all, been following your chats over the last week while I have been recovering from chemo number 6. Usual ups and downs but I have noticed how much more tired I have been this time, really have felt like they finally turned my battery off.  White cells have been very low over last few days so I am hoping I'm on my way up now, planned my post chemo shopping trip this saturday and believe me nothing is coming between me and those shops! Finally also getting rid of the dog in my mouth and I will be very very happy never to taste it again, for me its been the absolute worst part of the the chemo, I love my food, and yes like you Kat I looked down at my nails on sunday and had the shock of my life to see them all ridged and stripy. I guess we should think ourselves lucky that we kept them at all.  Also have the wrinkles going on, particularly on my hands even with the help of aquaeous cream by the bucket. I'm off for my oncology visit tomorrow, must admit I really hate going into the hospital now, bad memories. Looking forward to seeing what my hair comes back like, would love to be really curly after years of straight hair!! Good luck with your radiotherapy, I start on the 19th april but I did find the position they need my arm to be in very painful and I now have my compression sleeve which I have to get used to wearing throughout treatment to manage my lymphodaemia, all good fun as usual. Keep going all of you no matter what stage you are at, the summer is on its way.... Teggielass x  ",
