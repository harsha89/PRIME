      "Content": "Words fail me! After a recall mammogram at the start of this month and subsequent lumpectomy with sentinel node removal I am just coming to terms with having breast cancer. Today I received the results of my bowel screening (both happen when you reach your 54th birthday in Scotland) and I've failed that too! I phoned the screening service who think it might be because I did it so soon after the lumpectomy but I don't see how blood from way up there can end up in my digestive system and way down there! I've to do more tests and wait two weeks for the results. Sorry to whine but I'm so uncomfortable and sorry for myself tonight! Can anyone reassure me that this can happen and the blood can disperse that way. My breast nurse wasn't convinced!",

      "Content": "I teach primary school children and have been off work since the start of this month when my mammogram and subsequent biopsy showed a small tumour was growing in my left breast. I've since had a WLE and sentinel node removal. I've been lucky, the results show its been caught early. I've to have radiotherapy and tamoxifen. The school is holding a Macmillan coffee morning on Thursday. It's a chance for me to support this fantastic charity and show the children I'm not too unwell. Quite a few parents know what's happened to me, but not all. Long story but what do I say to my pupils? I won't be going back to work until I've recovered from the radiotherapy and am normally never off! I don't want to upset anyone. My head teacher is very supportive and will be at my side! I thought I could say I'd had an operation and I would have to take time to completely recover??",

We are going to America in the summer and entering the pre existing condition of breast cancer is pushing the quotes up to £400 plus for two weeks! Nowicantravel quoted just over £100. Is this too good to be true? I can't find any reviews! Insurepink is £180 which is the next up.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, I was diagnosed at the end of August. I had never had any operations before, hate being sick and loath hospitals! Great combination! I had to have a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal.  As a friend said to me it is what it is... It was actually much easier than I thought it would be. I wasn't sick and drank loads of water afterwards which I think helped me to recover from the anaesthetic. Within a couple of hours I was up and about and felt pretty good considering! It was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be! Once home I did my exercises every day and didn't have any post op problems. Everything healed up perfectly! big cyber hugs and good luck!

      "Content": "I was diagnosed on the 3rd September and operated on Monday the 8th with a WLE and sentinel node removal (2 nodes removed) They couldn't feel any lump but it showed on the mammogram screening and ultrasound. It was IDC, only just over 1cm but didn't have clear margins. I'm just in shock having never been ill in my life. I'm never off work and left a class full of children just at the start of the school year! Suddenly I was having wires inserted to guide the surgeon and my nipple injected with blue dye! I hate being sick and had never experienced a general anaesthetic but found I reacted well. However I am still so tired and become tearful when I think of the possible results on Thursday this week. How can the surgeon possibly have removed it all with clear margins when he needed a wire guide to see it? I'm in a limbo as I'm normally so active and sociable! I've even missed visitors as I've been sleeping! I also can hear all the fluid sloshing around whenever I move. Is this normal? I know the tumour was deep so I suppose there's now a big space to fill!",

      "Content": "Hi Hannah Thanks for the hugs! The consultant who put my wire in said she was going to pump me full of local anaesthetic and she did! What a splendid job, I didn't feel a thing! Please say if it's sore as it shouldn't be! I had to wait until late afternoon for my GA complete with my wire 'antenna'! It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be by a long way. I did ask for everything that could be added to stop me feeling sick to be added and for me it worked! Let me know how it goes and big hugs back! Joy",
