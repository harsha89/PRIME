      "Content": "Hi   def do the cold cap. It is so cold it hurts for @ 15 min then is bearable. Dont chicken out. Its worth it. also dont have your hair cut short as its NOT necessary. make sure all the hair is wet and covered in conditioner. your chemo sessions will be longer as a result of using the cap.  Take a cap and a towel to hide your wet hair after the chemo session good luck        ",
