      "Content": "Good morning Jenny and Del.   I hope you don't mind me popping into your group but I spotted this post about sore mouth / throat and as I had treatment for mouth cancer I understand this all too well ! Yes, you can indeed buy the Difflam mouth rinse from the chemists but it does cost so try and get it on prescription .... occasionally I bought it when necessary, but ask the pharmacist for the bigger bottle ( they keep it in the actual pharmacy bit ) The regular smaller bottle doesn't go very far, hope this helps.
