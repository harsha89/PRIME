      "Content": "Hi Ladies... Posted on here a couple of weeks ago, and got some great reassurance from you and hoping you can do the same for me now... I had the wire guided biopsy under general yesterday and was told it went quite well (a few mammograms, an inconclusive needle biospy (sorry I haven't learned all the proper terminology yet) I still am none the wiser as to whether I have BC yet - which of course is a good thing). Anyway - the pain was excruiating this morning but the meds have made it numb now, but my breast has swollen to twice it's normal size (which under normal circumstances I would probably be delighted about as they are small lol) and I can see it's been bleeding quite a bit under the dressing.  Sorry to be gross but some was on my bra which I have smelt (eeewww) and its fine so I don't think it's infected.  I was told to take the dressing off after two days which would be tomorrow evening but I know I won't be able to face it as it looks a bit of a mess.  I am hoping you are going to say this is normal and it will all sort itself out as I am still knackered from the anesthetic and couldn't face going anywhere this evening or even tomorrow.  Sorry if this is all normal and to be expected.  Just none the wiser at the the moment. Many thanks xx  ",

I had my first mammogram on 21st of May and didn't actually get a final diagnosis until 1st of Aug (after inconclusive biospsies and the results of the lumpectomy (operation).    Compared to nearly all the ladies on here my case is very minor as caught so early.  I wonder if because they could guess what the diagnosis was going to be without even having a confirmation, there was not the rush rush rush that some people with more serious issues seem to have.  So I wonder if the fact that they seem to be in no big hurry might be a postive.  It certainly was in my case anyway.  Definitely change if you're not happy for sure though. Hope you get some good results soon. xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I hope you don't mind me butting in here but just wanted to share a few things with you. I've fortunately not had to have chemo on my c journey as I was caught very early, but I have had a hair loss issue for years. (Over 10 now)   I have posted quite a bit about hair on here and will try not to repeat what I have already said for those who read regularly, but firstly I want to say I know how distressing it can be having hair that really is a crowning glory, and knowing that temporarily you are going to lose it.  My hair was amazing (really thick cascades of shiny ringlets) and I would sometimes even be stopped in the street by people telling me what amazing hair I had.  For the first year of it's departure I did nothing but cry.  No-one could tell me why it was happening and there seemed no end to it.  I was heart breaking see the plughole literally blocked every morning and if I ran my hand through it masses of it would come away. Anyway - very long story short I tried for about 5 years to stop it using various different methods then gave up.  For the last 4 or so years I have just done my best to make it look thicker and healthier, which has involved using hair extentions some more permanent and others temporary (since my lumpectomy have just worn it on clips that I take in and out every day).   I probably have around a quarter of the hair I used to have.  I regularly used to wonder if I should cut it all off and try to find somewhere to have it made into some kind of wig so that at least I still had my own hair.  As I have some kind of condition that means my hair is all now different lengths this would never have worked for me, but the whole reason for me posting (apart from empathising with those who are struggling with the fact that they are losing their hair) is to suggest that anyone with good long hair should DEFINITELY cut it off and keep it as Lilybeth suggested.  Even if you decide never to do anything with it for personal use, you can actually get money for it (especially if its untreated hair) as there are plenty of people out there who will  buy it.  (People like me LOL)  Just put 'remy hair' into google and see what you get.  Lilybeth - salons like Lucinda Ellery in london use a very fine mesh to give people semi permanent hair replacement systems.  Maybe you could look into that way of utilising the hair on the comb? If anyone wants to add me as a friend and have a good old moan to a symathetic ear please add me as a friend.  Lots of luck and love and chins up.  And look foward to the day that you will see it starting to regrow:)  xx",

Not sure if there have been any threads on this before, and apologies if I am repeating stuff that's been said, but one really useful therapy is CBT (cognitive behavioural thereapy).  The basics of CBT are about acknowleding the negative, but also searching for a positive to balance things out, and making sure that all  the thoughts that are causing the upset are actually facts and not just imaginings.  I believe that CBT is gaining a foothold within the NHS as a really effective way of treating lots of different issues, and when I googled CBT for cancer patients, without actually reading any of them, I could guess just from the number of articles the search produced that's it probably considered to be worthwhile.  There is a 'CBT for dummies' book if people aren't keen on actually going to a therapist, and for the sake of 12 quid or whatever it might cost, to get some balanced thinking going it has to be worth a shot.  Obviously just focusing on the negatives isn't partiularly healthy (there will always be a postive almost all situations, however small it may seem) but equally only thinking 'positive' thoughts can be equally as damaging.  I've heard it said (by a very wise therapist) that only using positive thoughts without acknowleding the negative is like having a birthday cake made of dog food covered with beautiful icing - it looks great on the outside but when you cut into it it's really not very good at all (Unless of course you are canine - Winston your terriers might like it!!)  Just my thoughts.  Love to all xx",

Then do your best to distract yourself by whatever means.  Easier said than done though sometimes.  Feel free to add me as a friend. Best wishes xx",

It sounds like you have a bit more going on than I had.  For me not ever even a mention of lymph node involvement and no medication at all.  (For which I am very thankful).  24 hours or so after reading and hearing that report I've decided to ignore it.  I'm grateful for the screening and I am grateful for the treatment.  Unnecessary or not - I have peace of mind, and I trust that the MDT would not be spending their valuable budget on me unless I needed it .  Yes - if I hadn't been selected for screening (not 50 yet) I would have been none the wiser - and could have lived happily ever after in blissful ignorance about the abnormal cells, but if they had started to change I could have ended up with a lot more to deal with. Think long and hard if you are considering refusing treatment  - I know there are risks associated with rads but nowhere near what they used to be (as I am led to believe.)  I have had very few probs so far apart from a bit of itching and being very tired.  With best wishes xx  ",

Not me.  And if the NHS offer you a course of treatment (in my case after the surgery,  just rads) WHY OH WHY would you question the need for it?  If we are to trust them (like we are expected to) how on earth can the ball be then passed back to us to make our own decision?  Either we need treatment or we don't.    This one's got me a bit pissed.",

Hope I've not made anyone paranoid with the above, but I don't think it's just as easy buying a product that claims to be 'free from' this, that or the other.    I don't think ANY of these products or chemicals are harmful on their own, or they wouldn't get away with selling it (mind you - they still sell cigarettes still don't they) but maybe it's a cumulative effect that could be the issue.  Years and years of build up.   I'm just here thinking aloud really but hope I am not freaking anyone out! xx",

Anyone who can offer me any ideas on the best mindset to try and acheive until I can get to two weeks after the op when I will finally know one way or the other would be much appreicated!  Thanks in advance of any responses:)",

So six weeks down the track and had the first Onc appt last week and she told me to get it checked again by the BCN which I did today.  The looked at it on ultrasound and said yes it was a haematoma(it's massive - about 2 inches) and will eventually disperse.  The more it actually has healed the more prominent the lump has become but 3 peeps had a look today and no-one was concerned. I hope that reassures you in some way but I would still get someone to have a look to put your mind at rest, as people have suggested.  3 weeks is a lot of worrying time isn't it. Best wishes xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Louise, Saw the BC nurse for the very same thing today.   Had a lumpectomy on 17th July and a couple of days after the breast was 3 times bigger than normal and really painful.  Went back to see the BC nurse after a couple of days and she said it was probably a haematoma or seroma but nothing needed to be done. So six weeks down the track and had the first Onc appt last week and she told me to get it checked again by the BCN which I did today.  The looked at it on ultrasound and said yes it was a haematoma(it's massive - about 2 inches) and will eventually disperse.  The more it actually has healed the more prominent the lump has become but 3 peeps had a look today and no-one was concerned. I hope that reassures you in some way but I would still get someone to have a look to put your mind at rest, as people have suggested.  3 weeks is a lot of worrying time isn't it. Best wishes xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Franoli, I just had a lumpectomy too but the day after it was very swollen and leaking.  I called the BCN and they asked me to come in to show them the day after that  - the swelling had reduced and she said the leakage was normal, but she insisted that they would rather reassure me than leave me worrying.  i would call and check with them if I were you. Best wishes xx",
