      "Content": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your mum's diagnosis. It is a huge shock when we see our parent's vulnerability as we are so used to them always being the strong ones & looking after us. While caring for my mum there has been many times where I have felt I want to be the child again! Your emotions are all over the place just now and that is perfectly understandable. Please don't feel embarrassed about breaking down or becoming emotional. People really do care and understand. I am at the stage I don't care anymore and will have a good old bubble whenever I feel the need - sometimes all you need is some words of comfort from someone or anyone to get you through a bad moment. Please get a referral from your mum's doctor to the Macmillan nursing service. They take a lot of pressure off families as they can liaise with GPs or hospital staff on your behalf. Also, check to see if there is a cancer volunteer driver service in your area. It is a free service and they would take your mum to and from any hospital appointments she may have. It can be useful when family are unable to get time off work.Â  Please take care. Best wishes to you and your family x",

      "Content": "I felt at first like I directed all my anger at the word cancer. I used to be seething with rage at times when I heard the word on TV, radio etc. When your mum starts her treatment you will be with her every step of the way. You will be amazed at the strength that you find from somewhere within yourself to keep going. Take one step at a time. It is easy to become overwhelmed by it all.",
