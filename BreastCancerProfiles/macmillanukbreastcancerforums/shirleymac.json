      "Content": "Hi just wanted to let you know I am feeling very much the same.  You think great treatment is over but then it hits you.  I liken it a to a little bit of post traumatic stress.  You have so much going on and support whilst undergoing treatment and then when it is over feel that you are on your own.  I could cry some days but I think that is a little bit due to the Anastrazole I am on too.  My situation is not helped by the fact I am under the infamous Stafford hospital (who I must say were brilliant whilst being treated).  The Trust has been dissolved and it now comes under North Staffs area.  This means that the oncologist that I was seeing and trusted no longer works at the hospital as the hospital where she is based in under a different authority now.  The replacement I saw on Friday was a man who obviously had not read my notes as he asked how my chemo was going when I finished in April and finished all treatment in July.  He also gave me a prescription for a couple of items which, when I took them to the pharmacist she questioned the dose and instructions on both.  Added to this since my surgery in May I have always had discomfort where one of the drains was fitted. I thought this was just the healing process but I had some inflammation around the mark so asked the breast care unit to look at it.  I still had a stitch in place.  They removed most of it but skin had grown over some of it so could not remove all of it.  Again when I went for my post surgery check up it was a different surgeon to the one that did the mastectomy and I had to tell him that my history.  I had had a WLE first then needed a mastectomy later.  He thought I had just had the WLE.  He also missed the stitch when he checked how I was healing.   Does not exactly fill me with confidence.  May ask to be seen by the surgeon who did the mastectomy in future.  At lease I trust her.   Also had my annual mammogram this afternoon.  First one since treatment finished.  I was OK about it until I was actually having it done then it sort of hit me.  Was a bit wobbly when I came out.  It was this time last year that I was diagnosed after a routine mammogram.  Fingers crossed it is OK this time.  Hope you feel better soon.",

Since then I have suffered from peripheral neuropathy which makes soles of feet burn, restless legs and numbness in toes and fingertips.  At the end of January I contracted a bacterial infection which led to cellulitis of the arm.  I was hospitalised for three days on IV vancomycin antibiotics then had another 12 days of 1800 mg clindamycin a day.My arm is much improved but still feel very tired.  My main worry though  is that I am shaky inside.  My GP thinks it may be anxiety. I am having a hard time at work and cannot face returning yet and because the cellulitis appeared overnight I think it gave me a scare which brought back all that we have been through these last three years. My husband has also had cancer last year.  I am wondering however whether the feeling of internal shakiness and sometimes shaky hands may be after effects of the antibiotics or they have worsened the neuropathy. I also get stabbing pains in my fingertips of the affected hand and a feeling the same as restless legs but in my arms.  Sorry for the long post but this constant tremor is driving me mad.  If anyone can shed any light I would be grateful.  I am seeing my oncologist in a couple of weeks so I will discuss it then.  Thanks all.",

      "Content": "My hair is just growing back so I am too rocking the Sinead O'Connor look but to be honest I did not ever mind being bald. I am going to keep my hair short as everyone has said it suits me.  I shaved my hair off as soon as it started falling out and only wore hats and scarves because I did not want other people to feel embarrassed when they saw me.  I had some brilliant pleated turbans which I had lots of compliments about but I bought them from my local market so I could not recommend a website.  I found them easier than scarves as you could just pop them on and off when you were answering the door etc.  They fit snugly and I never worried about them coming off.  If you can find some they are worth investing in.  I hardly wore my wig as I hated it.  It was itchy and too hot.",
