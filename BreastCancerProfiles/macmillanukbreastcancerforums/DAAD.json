    "Content": "Hi  I have only just begun to hear about this \u2018brave to shave fund raiser \u2018 At first thought I did think it was a good idea but hearing everyone discussing how it makes them feel I totally agree . I only looked at it as an outsider , I\u2019m not living with cancer but my hubby is .but I can completely understand. Maybe a more useful thing to \u2018help\u2019 would be for people to grow their hair long enough for it to be put to use to make wigs for the patients that would like one . A friend of mine who has had breast cancer & lost  her hair has just grown hers to be used for this .money was donated to be given to making this into a real hair wig & towards research I think this was such a lovely idea x  ",
