      "Content": "To cut a long story short,I had removal of Silicone implant 5 weeks ago,due to infection, there was a bleb on the strattice, which was sorted, then still did not heal,subsequently silicone implant removed. Now appear to have scar tissue and seroma,and still have a leaking open wound. The strattice meshes in with the tissue,I believe. Is this he cause of the leaking I wonder?any one else have this problem?seeing BCN on Monday.",
