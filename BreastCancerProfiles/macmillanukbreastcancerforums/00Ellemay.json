    "Content": "Hi Jess,  My love and support to you and your family, at this difficult time, your mum\u2019s battle has been amazing!    If something doesn\u2019t feel right to you, you really need to go back and ask for a second opinion. Of course you are going to be anxious and worried with your family history. (If in doubt, check it out!) Not to worry you with this but I had a lump in my breast that on first examination by my GP said it was nothing to worry about but like yourself I was worried and concerned because my mother 5 years previously had battled bladder cancer and is in remission now, I went back for a second opinion and it was found unfortunately to be breast cancer. Having chemotherapy at present.  You need to stay positive though! (and as calm as possible I know this is very difficult)  It could be absolutely nothing at all to be worried about and further investigation could show exactly as your GP stated in the first place. But any lump shouldn\u2019t be ignored. I would definitely say go back and ask for a second opinion if only to put your own mind at rest.  I really hope this helps you and please note that 80% of breast lumps are nothing to worry about but it\u2019s always best to get it checked out! (Better to be safe than sorry!)  Sending best wishes and a good result! Elle xx",
