      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed metastatic unknown primary / occult breast cancer as they found cancer cells in two of my swollen lymph nodes under my right arm.  However they could not find anything in my breasts.  After 6 cycles of net-adjuvant chemo of FEC-T, the swollen lymph nodes have shrunk and the surgeon advised to remove all the lymph nodes under my right arm.  Has anybody experienced similar conditions and got any advice whether this is the only option? I am worried about the higher risk of lymphedema and also any potential long-term effects with the axillary lymph nodes dissection where all the axillary lymph nodes are removed, but having all lymph nodes removed and tested may mean a better chance of cancer clearance? Has anybody got any advice or sharing please? Thanks, Sleepy Mushroom",

      "Content": "Hi Julia, Thank you so much for sharing your experience.  Sorry to hear about the lymphoedema in your breast and hope it has got better. The surgeon told me that he planned to take out all of my lymph nodes under my right arm though.  I read about the potential long-term side effects and was taken aback by them so wonder whether there are any other options.  I guess it's like the risk of residual cancer vs the risk of potential long term side effects of axillary clearance. Thanks, Sleepy Mushroom x",

I asked the surgeon about the sentinel node option, but he was of the opinion that I am not suitable for it because I am node positive before and after chemo.  I will also try to seek advice from other sources and think about it.

      "Content": "Hi Susie, Glad to hear from you again after some time.  Hope you are doing well.   My malignant lymph nodes just got smaller.  They still showed up on CT scan and I can still feel them under my arm.  The oncologist and surgeon said radiotherapy may be recommended after surgery. So you had surgery followed by chemo and I'm having it the other way round.  Not sure why they recommended that way.   I still have questions in my mind and may want to see the surgeon again if possible.  I wonder whether there would be any value of doing any further scans before the surgery too as there was a lesion in my liver before and after chemo.   It is quite hard not knowing the primary and not knowing the extent of it.  Did you have radiotherapy on the side of breast of the affected lymph nodes?
