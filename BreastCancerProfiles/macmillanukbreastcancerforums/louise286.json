My first diagnosis was in oct 2011 had a lumpectomy chemo and rads i thought that was the end of it, all active treatment finished in april 2012 but in august that year i felt a lump in the breast i got fobbed off so many times by the doctors telling me it was impossible for it to return so quickly after treatment so i thought they no best and left it for a while, but in my mind i knew something was not right so i made a stand and had a biopsy and low and behold it was back, so had a mx in sept 2012 but no other treatment as i was told it didn't work the fist time so wouldn't this time dr told me to look him in the eye and said the mx would have got it. ok i thought brilliant but the past few months i have been in pain going back and forth to the breast unit again surgeons telling me i don't warrant any tests or scans because the ones i had showed up nothing again i thought ok i must be fine and i am thinking to much into things, but last week i went to my local gp to talk about my pain meds and asked him to look at a small frozen pea sized lump which i thought was a mozzie bite on my chest wall he referred me straight away and today i was told the lump is cancer so in all i have been diagnosed 3 times in 2 years. i am angry , numb, and have been having panic attacks i am afraid for my kids who are 6 and 14 having to see me go through this again xxxxxxxxxx",
