      "Content": "Hello, 2 years past finding the lump under my arm, a reoccurrence from original breast lump. Keeping well after treatment but would love to chat with others who have this amount of lymph involvement for some mutual support. Have not come across people with this amount, so grateful to be well but would love some positive info, it can feel a little lonely after all the whirlwind of treatment is over and you cant touch base with a BC nurse every day. Keep Well All x",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, Sorry for the delay in replying, I am not very up to speed with how the groups work and didn't know I had any replies! Know what you mean about the amount of lymph involvement, 9/13 for me on right side, Consultant was a little tight lipped re any connection between numbers involved and prognosis, he just said some women do very well. Also mine is a recurrence so no figs available, so I'm told. All I keep in mind is that the scan showed no spread. I try to eat super well and follow the Plant Programme (no dairy and other changes to diet) and try to take care of my body and mind. Hope the treatment goes well, and personally, I strangely found comfort from the whirlwind of treatment. Post treatment can be a lonely place at times, all be it with more hair :). But most of the time I saviour and make the most of each and ever day. Very best wishes,  Mia x",
