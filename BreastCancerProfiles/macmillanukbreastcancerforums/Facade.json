    "Content": "I have had three primary breast cancers in the last fifteen years with all the usual treatments. The last diagnosis was in February and my treatment remains ongoing.  I feel really guilty for saying this but I have had enough, I am exhausted with it all and just want to say to cancer 'enough, do your worst'!  I am also fed up of not being able to say how l feel for fear of upsetting people who l know care about me.  Cancer has been kind enough to allow me to see my children grow up, as well as being able to go to my daughters wedding earlier in the year. However, this round of treatment has been traumatic and really distressing for my children. I am so very, very tired of it all. I also feel guilty because I have an amazing surgeon and oncology nurse who are trying very hard, but I really just want to let go and get some peace at last. I am trying to hang in there for my children who l know love me dearly and l them. However,  l am tired of pulling on a brave face in order to protect others. The burden of this the third time around is unbearable. ",
