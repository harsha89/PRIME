Eat what you can Spicey foods were out for me. The nurses recommended pineapple, but I found it too acidy , all the best xxx",

      "Content": "Hi,  I went through same chemo in 2009,  i understand how you feel, and agree with everything ermoinig wrote, but wasn't able to make a lot of changes to my diet, and what I was eating was quite healthy. Difflam mouthwash helped with the sore mouth, and just sheer will power, and sometimes just a belief that the doctors know the effect of the chemo so tell them everything. Ring the GP for extra support or the breast care nurse, talk to friends and family about how you are feeling. Lots of hugs. SB xxx",

Good luck  SB xxxx George and Jackie thanks for the info on herceptin,  currently on cycle 21 and struggling a bit xxx",
