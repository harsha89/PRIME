      "Content": "I am now theee years post op and nearly three years post radiotherapy. I took Tamoxifen for 2.5 years and am now on Anastrasole. When I was diagnosed I weighed ten stone and now over thirteen stone. I have followed and attended slimming world plan all of this time. I exercise regularly and am just stressed and depressed with all of this. I hate myself being like this but seem to be totally stuck in a big dark hole. My GP keeps saying don\u2019t worry and the Oncologist is also not concerned, none of this helps. Has anyone else been down this road?",
