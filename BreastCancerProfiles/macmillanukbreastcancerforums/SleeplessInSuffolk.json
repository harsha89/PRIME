    "Content": "Hi CKboni. I was diagnosed last Wednesday with inflammatory breast cancer. I totally get the shock and utter heartbreak you must be feeling. Bless my Dad, Â he told me to ask loads of questions no matter how silly you feel. It's is so much to take in. Remember there are different types of breast cancer and different treatment plans. I just went to my GP and asked for the flu jab after clearing it with with the breast unit first. My friend who had breast cancer told me to ask about it because I don't think you can once the chemo starts. Best wishes to you xxx",
