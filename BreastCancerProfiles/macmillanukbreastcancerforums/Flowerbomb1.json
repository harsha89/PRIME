      "Content": "Hi jojo186 Firstly can I say hi to everyone, I've logged on daily to this fab site, sapped up loads of excellent advice which has helped me through the last 10 months but never posted anything, but today I felt a need to. I've had 8 chemo,mastectomy, got the ALL CLEAR and just finished rads on Monday - yippee!!!!  anyway that's enough about me. I've posted so I can say I'm so so made up for you, when I seen your update today I actually had a little cry for you as I can relate to how worried you must have been and how relieved you are now (fingers crossed for sample results)   I'm so glad you haven't had to join \"the nasty bugger club\". xx",
