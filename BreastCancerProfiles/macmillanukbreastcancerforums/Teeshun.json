      "Content": "Thanks Helen :-)  I don't have a dressing Jo. All i have is 2 small plaster type dressings which I've had on since I left hospital last Wednesday. I'm due to see the consultant tomorrow morning though so perhaps she'll change it then. I have one plaster over the cut for the SNB and one  plaster for the WLE / nipple removal. My breast is huge at the moment !! :-) Bigger than the unaffected one but i read somewhere that swelling can make that happen so I'm sure it will go down soon. I'm still fairly bruised at the moment but nothing too bad.   No I haven't had chemo so it's not that. I had to have a suspect lymph node removed from the breast as well (i thought you only got them under your arms but seemingly not) , so provided that comes back clear and provided they got good enough clearance, my surgeon has indicated that I should only have to do radiotherapy after this. Fingers crossed  I think you may be right about the nerves knitting back together as I'm definitely far less numb under the arm pits and the sides of the breast this past few days and the tiredness is probably just the cocodamol/anaesthetic after effects. Well that's what I've decided anyways lol  I think I was just worrying and wanted to compare how someone else of similar time/WLE was doing because I felt so okay after op that I hate to feel that I'm slipping backwards now. My little boy is 10 and quite severely disabled so I really need to see myself going forwards not backwards as he needs a lot of care.   Anyways, thank you for replying and i really hope you get a good result next week Gill xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies , Yes I'm going back in on the 10th May for more clearance . They didn't take  enough from round the 2nd lump because they didn't think it was a cancer . The Surgeon also needs to \"sweep up \" those precancerous cells that were found in the clearance of my main lump . She says I have a 90% chance of clearing it all out this time and that's a chance my surgeon feels I should consider rather than mastectomy due to better recovery time , less reconstruction etc  she says the lymph nodes will get taken care of by the radiotherapy.    So ..... thats what I've decided to do . Another attempt at clearance with a 10% chance of still having to go back for mastectomy.  One of my deciding factors was my little boy and being able to care for him again faster this way . They said it shouldn't be a factor in my decision  but that's easy for lto say when theyre not fighting social services for respite care and asking friends To help care for a disabled epileptic child !     Anyways, today is a new day and I'm much more positive today . I've ordered pink  bandanas online because I love pink and I'm organising a stairlift for my little boy so that the respite ladies can get him up to bed on their own . Upwards and onwards ladies :-)  Thank you for all your kind replies. It really helps xxx Jo - I'm sending you positive thoughts and prayers for Wednesday . For every positive there's a negative so as my result was pants , I'm praying yours will be brilliant lol xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies,  Problem solved! the Surgeon told me today that while she was removing 5 lymph nodes,  she gave me a local anaesthetic into the muscle under my arm to help with the pain.  That's why i was so pain free for the first few days and then as it wore off , it became more painful. Problem solved  and it's actually much better today ;-)  Now the bad news  :-(    What they thought was a suspect lymph node in the breast was actually another very small cancer. They also found pre cancerous cells in the clearance that they removed and 3 out of 5 of the lymph nodes that the removed had cancer.  What can i say? I was gutted! I had my lump biopsied 6 months ago and it came back negative so when It was biopsied again in March they reassured me that it was unlikely to be cancer....but it was. And then i had an MRI and it came back fine.....before being recalled after it was checked a second time. And then i had another sonagram to check the suspect lymph found in the MRI and i was reassured that they had no concerns about it. I had it checked again on surgery day and the consultant said that the more she looked at it , the more convinced she was that it was fine. And finally it was removed under surgery and bugger me, it wasn't a lymph node after all, it was a small cancer tumour. I keep being reassured and then getting kicked in the gut. It's so hard :-(  I really need to sleep on this and try and get my head round it because right now I just can't take it in  night night Gill xxx",

Surprisingly it's not the nipple area that's sore though, it's my underarm and SNB area . I'll talk this through with Fiona my BCN tomorrow though and see what she says.

We both had our ops within a day of each other and your surgery sounds identical to mine -  radioactive injection, guided wire and lumpectomy. And same as you, i was out that same day and felt great for the next 2 days. After that though it's kinda been a bit downhill and I'm not sure if I'm being a right wimp. I stopped taking the cocodamol after day 1  because i felt it was making me very tired with shaky jelly legs. Instead i took the odd paracetamol for a day or so as i really wasn't in much pain. The last few days though it's all changing. I'm now 8 days post op and I'm sorer now than i was then, I'm taking paracetamol 4 hourly and I'm constantly tired with weak legs. I think the pain is worse because my underarm is losing a lot of its numbness and is sorer when i move it but I'm not quite sure why i'm still so tired though. I just really thought it would all be getting better by now :-(  Gill xx",

My chemo was instantly suspended for 5 weeks as I was at \"an increased risk of infection \" . my chemo nurse told me that they'd had a previous patient who hadn't told them that they were bleeding and the patient later died due to infection. Obviously I do not want to scaremonger here but I think it's important to find out which consultant is correct.  I had the threat of not being allowed to continue my chemo hanging over me but eventually She changed me to weekly chemo for 12 weeks with Paxlitaxel instead of  Docetaxol. I have to see her every week as well and report that I am fine with no diarrhoea and no bleeding  Gill xx",

Very expensive but I used it every day and still use it now 6 months later to fill in the baldy patches I\u2019ve been left with .    You could ask your chemo nurse but I believe you\u2019re not meant to get brows tattooed until at least 6 months after chemo finished so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s an option .     One of the most effective things I found was that I always wore a bit of fake tan during my chemo to make me look a healthier colour    Good luck on your phased return  Gill xx",
