      "Content": "Hello, I had my right breast removed and full lymph node clearance five weeks ago. I'm healing well and don't have any complications apart from expected stiffness and soreness. However, I do keep getting an odd sensation when I drink hot or cold liquid. It feels as if the liquid is running under my right breast bone down to my armpit instead of my stomach. I know this seems strange but wondered if anyone else has had anything similar? Thanks Andrea",

      "Content": "Thanks for responding Jean, I wondered if I was going a bit mad, but I definitely get these sensations. Going to do some more research to find out more, so will let you know. My boyfriend has suggested it might have something to do with the disturbance of nerve endings in the area. Hope all is well. Take care Andrea",
