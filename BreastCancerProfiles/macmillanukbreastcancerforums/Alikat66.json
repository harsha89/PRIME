      "Content": "I've heard about the facial hair and am getting quite worried. I have finished chemo - want given the last dose of taxotere because of two neutrophenic episodes I had.  Noticed hair regrowth after first dose of taxotere but it is pretty much like bum fluff at the moment. I can see though that it is is very grey with the odd dark strands here and there. Funny enough my leg hairs have returned but not underarm and my private (!!) are coming back. I am looking forward to what my head hair is going to look like. I have decided  that I will not mess around with its colour. ",

      "Content": "Hello! Yes please stay in touch.  How did you cope with Taxotere? I am sure yoUr surgery will be successful. I had 13 lymph glands/nodes removed at the time of the lumpectomy of which 8 were infected. So after chemo finishes (2 tax left) I will have a single mastectomy after which radiotherapy and hormone therapy. Not to mention 18 doses of herceptin. It just all feels a liitle too much and being at the end of my chemo cycle I am told it isnt surprising. Hang in there mate. X",

      "Content": "I would love to hear if anyone has experienced what I am going through. Had fec and coped with it pretty much ok. Then had my first course of taxotere 2 weeks ago which completely wiped me out. Was admitted to hospital ladt week for 3 days with neutropenia although they found no infection but because of my low blood count treated mr with antibiotics. Since coming out of hospital I have been constsntly worrying about my temperature and am so anxious right now. My next dose of taxotere (which oncologist has decided to reduce) is on thursday next week with my first dose of herceptin the day before. Just need my mind to be put at rest so woukd love any comments. ",

      "Content": "Hiya!  Very similar to my findings.  I had a lumpectomy on 28 January 13 and they did not find clear margins.  This meant that I needed to have a mastectomy which I am seeing the surgeon about on Thurs this week.  So between then and now I have completed chemotherapy and started on Herceptin.  Don't be discouraged - seems to be how it goes for some women.  Like I've heard said on here many times, we will kick it's butt.  So keep positive and get your boxing gloves on. xx",

      "Content": "Hello Angie.  Its all so blooming difficult sometimes isn't it?  I had a lumpectomy end of January.  The surgeon saw me in the hospital and said it all went well.  Then went back for the results two weeks later and they said 8 of the 13 nodes were infected or affected as you put it.  Shock horror!!  So they have suggested a mastectomy (single) which I am having done on 5 August.  Rads and hormone therapy will follow.    I have an excellent team looking after me and am happy to leave myself in their care.  Will do what they ask of me.  Chemo for me was hard going.  I was on FEC-T.  Had 3 Fec and to be honest now feel that although it was bad it was nothing like the T (Taxotere).  The latter sent me into hospital after each dose with neutropenia sepsis so they cancelled the last dose.  Lost all my hair on Fec including eyes and as another lovely person on this site in the 'lady garden'.  Lol!  I love that.  Lots of lovely flowers spring to mind.  Now, back to the subject.  So with no facial hair looking in the mirror confirmed I was a cancer patient and that disturbed me.  But with the love and support of family, friends and the best CNS ever, I got through it.  Hair started growing back on T and continues to grow.  Now, when I say grow it isn't what you would imagine.  It is still very fine (bum fluff) but you can see it - about 3mm in length maybe more.  Funny thing of all is that I used baby shampoo on my scalp from the time I shaved my hair off shortly after Fec number one.   I take my hat off to you for work.  I took 6 months off and am likely to have a further month added to that.  For me it would have been too difficult given the long commute.   I wish you all the best with your treatment - don't ever feel you have to be 'normal' during it.  If you need to scream, shout, cry, laugh then just do it.  Trust me expressing your emotions lightens the load.  Hugs.   Kat xxxx",
