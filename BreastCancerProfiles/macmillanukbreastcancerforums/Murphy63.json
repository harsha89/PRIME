I know a friend of mine in another hospital was told only her first chemo she could have someone with her but she insisted her husband was with her at all appointments and they let him. So sorry to hear of your experience :-(",

I have a huge sickness phobia and got into such a state,mi swore I wasn't going back for any further chemo. Anyway first day really of feeling halfway human again, although appetite still very low, but trying little and often. Options for my next poison have been to reduce the dose of chemo, and have my sickness meds via syringe driver. I've also to be referred to psychologist and I went to a hypnotherapist yesterday and I'm hopeful that'll help me. I'm just wondering if anyone had their chemo reduced and if this made a difference, and also has anyone had syringe driver for their sickness meds, and did this make a difference? Many thanks xxxxx",

Really interesting to hear the oncologist personal opinion, I hope mine will tell me theirs as I think that would defo sway things. To say I am terrified is an understatement, I have a vomiting phobia and although all the other side affects would be horrible, the sickness part is what I worry about most (crazy I know in the scheme of things!!!). I had thought I'd got off lightly compared to some with only radiotherapy and tamoxifen in the pot, so this is a whole new ball game xxxx",

I've to meet with the oncologist to discuss whether chemo would be of benefit to me. My understanding is it's my decision?!?!?! I'm sure I read a post recently about someone in same position.

As you say everyone is different so will just need to wait and see. I will be having radiotherapy and hormone therapy after my op if all goes according to plan!!! I won't be working through my radiotherapy as I have an hour drive each way and I need to try to fit my appointments in the middle of the day so that I can drop off and pick up my 9 year old at school (he goes back to school the day of my op :-( ) I have taken the news about my cancer in my stride up to now but I am getting a bit anxious now. I go for my pre op assessment this week so it's starting to feel real. I've never had surgery before so that's a bit scary. In the scheme of things though I am very lucky as I was only diagnosed after a routine scan so things could've been so much worse. Lots of love x",

My first question is how long do you think I'll be off work for. My boss has been asking and I've asked my GP and he said he doesn't know!!! My second question is this. I have never had planned sick leave before, so when do I get a sick line from my GP? Do I make an appoint before my op or do I self cert the first week and then go to GP? Thanks for reading!!",
