      "Content": "I had a very sore crusty nose on docetaxol. It turned out to be an infection and I had to get antibiotics for it. It was agony though so yours hopefully isn't infected. The doctor can prescribe a cream for up your nose. I think it's called naseptin. It should really help. Best wishes Sara xx",
