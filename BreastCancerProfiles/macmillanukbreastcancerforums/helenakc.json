      "Content": "Hi Kiera, Wanted to wish you the best for Thursday. I am 55 so post menopausal. I had  the tumour removed last weekend and sentinal plus 2 nodes removed. Had the results last Friday and I am so lucky the tumour was only 1.1cm not 1.8 as they had thought and the nodes are clear so I am one of the lucky ones who does not need to have chemo. Here in Switzerland they seem to prefer to take the tumour out and then follow with radiation rather than removing the whole breast as there is no health benefit from the whole removal. My tumour as just to the right of the right nipple and now only  8 days later you can hardly see where the operation took place as he made the incision along the nipple line. My cancer is ER+ so RADS and then 2 years of Tamoxifen and then perhaps AIs if the reasearch shows there is a good reason to risk heart disease, bone fractures and brain damage...will wait and see. I was a little tired afterwards and scared like crazy and trying to think positive while waiting for results almost impossibe. Even working out at the gym like a possessed creature still didn't help much. I want to send everyone out there who reads this and is suffering lots of energy. I feel renewed to know I am one of the lucky ones. The surgeon has doen his bit, the RADS and Taxoxifen will do their bit and I need to do the rest. Am 3 kilos lighter, have gone vege and organic. Lots of exercise and reducing my work load to lower the stress.  Virtual hugs to all. Helena  ",

      "Content": "Hello Kiera, I have all fingers and toes and everything else crossed for you to have the same result as I did. I had Rad 2 today, 23 to go and feel fine. At the gym 5 days a week and am on a juice fast to up my immune system to get rid of any cells that may be being killed off by radiation. A small tip just in case you need it. I was almost hyperventilating while I was waiting to see the doc. So maybe take someone with you who can take your mind off it a little or a good book or something funny... Has never happened to me before so I guess I was mega frightened... so maybe drink some calming tea before and take lots of deep breaths.    Am sending positve thoughts and energy your way. Virtual Hugs Helena",

      "Content": "Hi glad you are feeling okay. Horrid this waiting ... I am crossing all fingers and toes that you are lucky like me and the nodes come back clear. I start RADS on Monday so will keep you posted. I know it is hard to do but...but each time a negative thought comes into my  head....and they do too often.... I try to replace it with a positive. Someone once said ....thoughts become things ....so I try to think about the outcome I want....and read lots of detective novels to keep my mind occupied. My surgeon was funny when I said \"I guess I will go home and have another cup of green tea to celebrate\"....he looked very serious and said...champagne, doctors orders!!!....so I did just that!!! Look forward to a virtual champagne with you on Wednesday.    ",
