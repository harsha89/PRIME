You are already prepared for treatment and surgery, so there's no reason to believe that this second lump will make any difference to your plan as yet, I m sure the shock is what's getting to you today, it's been found and will be treated along with the fist lump.

I wanted to look ok in a bra, bikin i wasn't worried about naked !  Do you need RT after op, as can affect  implant  I believe. Recon using your own bits! will age better with you however some will use an implant as well . Think about your lifestyle and expectations . I m sure you've had leaflets and done some research, ask anything that is on your mind and be sure that for you it's what you want . What might you find easier to deal with emotionally...  I knew I needed to wake up with a boob !! ( But be prepared to wait for healing to see end results , at first I was a bit shocked thinking it was too big, i was just jumping the gun !)  Now I'm rambling! Hope it's given you food for thought! I know when I go to appointments my head just goes empty maybe jot down your thoughts to take with you.  Good luck xx",

Short flight should be ok ie Paris and to wear flight socks.  On coming home I realised I'm flying again in September so on those guide lines there's no room to start them before I fly again meaning I wouldn't actually get to take my first dose until near end of October.  Going by this if I flew twice a year I'd be having 4 months of no tamoxifen a year which seems odd to me.

My daughter was pregnant when I was diagnosed, so I can guarantee your mum is as worried about the effect on you as you are worried about her, be open and honest with each other and also try and just do some nice things during the waiting time . Also I'd say from my pathology results there were 4 tumours discovered not the just tbe 2 we had expected but no spread to my lymph nodes so hopefully for your mum this is the case, numerous tumours and size don't necessarily mean a worse case scenario I believe.  Glad you've  found a safe  place to chat about your concerns for now try and stay calm sending luck and a hug xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks Eddiboy  good outcome for you glad your family will now be monitored more closely , it's a little reassurance. That's what I'm thinking myself, I've given all family history and presumably they've now acsesed my mum's medical history,  I just hope I do get to testing stage, slightly worried it'll come back that they don't need to test . Worried either way to be honest . My mum was 43 at diagnosis,  maternal aunt 60 and myself 48 . Hopefully I 'll hear something soon it feels like the last hurdle don't think it'll stop you worring whatever the outcome but I need the knowledge!  Hope your as well as can be xxx",
