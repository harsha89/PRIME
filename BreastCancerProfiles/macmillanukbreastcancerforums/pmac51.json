    "Content": "Hi Ladies, I'm in the RT May club. Congratulations Mazzie5! I have just completed my first 4/19 sessions of Radiotherapy. So far so good. My wound has not healed yet (surgery March 26) my RT was postponed also for this reason. The first day I was anxious but my Oncologist gave the go ahead.Â  Heard a few people ringing the bell on Friday, felt so emotional. Good luck to each and every one of you...what a journey xx",
