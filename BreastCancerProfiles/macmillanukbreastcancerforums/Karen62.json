      "Content": "Hi Kaz First time I've posted anywhere, usually difficult getting near the laptop with my 23 yr old daughter. Not heard of taxane but will be googling it..I haven't been given another appointment with my oncologist yet. I've started on green tea and using natural shampoos (well while I've got my hair)trying to look at organic stuff but you can send yourself mad looking at packaging and ingredients. I've also been put on an acupunture trial being run by Leeds Uni to see if it can helpwith side effects only had one session but I'll try anything, very relaxing if nothing else. Leeds have a really good complimentary backup. If you want to get in touch would be good to email love Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Kaz I have just had a similar diagnosis and was also recommended to have chemo (6 x EC). The first was on 6 March and wasn't too bad a few days with something akin to a hangover without the drinking ! I have worried about the side effects and the toll it will take on my body but feel I dare not take a chance at not having it. Feeling ill has made the whole thing alot more real which isn't good but if its only a few days every three weeks it maybe ok. Worried about hair loss but guess its only for a few months. Hope you get through it without much trouble. As I keep being told, everyone is different and some get through without it being too traumatic but it is still very scary karen",

      "Content": "Hi Kaz I did ask about my missing 'F' and was told some health authorities (mine is Leeds) stopped using it as they felt it didn't offer anything extra to the EC. Who knows..its difficult to question. I am also triple negative so it makes it more reasonable to try everything. Its difficult not knowing why it started and what drives it, I've questioned everything from shampoos to pesticides and too much air travel..i'm sending my family mad when we go shopping!! I've also decided against the cold cap after one session.I must be a wuss as there were acouple of women who looked quite comfortable with it but I couldn't wait to get it off. Not convinced i suit hats and scarfs and even less convinced by my wig but if it saves spending 3 and a half hours with a freezer strapped to my head i'll convince myself. Day 12 and haven't lost any hair yet and feeling really good, walking most days for an hour even did abit of a hill walk on Sunday. Hope it goes ok for you, don't really post on here but would be good to now how you get on, love Karen",
