      "Content": "Hello Hides according to the radiotherapy Information leaflet I was given by my hospital, it says you can use crystalised deodorant such as PitRok,, but check with your radiotherapy team.  My radiotherapy starts in January and I will check with the team that's its ok. I have been using PitRok since  June and I love it.  Before I was getting sick of the icky feeling from roll ons and they were ruining my work blouses I don't know whether it was the uniform material or the deoderants but I had started to get unsightly stains.   I switched to spray but had trouble with them as had to hold my breath and leave the room after spraying as they made me choke.  I had just started looking at getting alternatives but thought the crystalised were expensive gimmicks, but I've been proved wrong and wish I'd switched to PitRok years ago.  I got mine from Boots and don't be put off by the price 5 months on and the same crystal has hardly shrunk so cheaper in the long run.  Just be careful not to drop it as apparently they can smash. Good luck with your Rads xx",

      "Content": "Hi Pocket Rocket, I've had just finished my chemo (WooHoo) 3 fec and 3 docetaxel.  I used Corsadyl mouthwash to start with to keep a healthy mouth.  I am using Gelclair as the roof of my mouth felt dry and raspy, and I was concerned of infection.  I switched to corsodyl toothpaste as found my usual toothpaste made me gag.  My mouth has been good as no soreness, ulcers or problems but I found I couldn't eat properly,  everything tasted funny or felt disgusting in my mouth.  Just the thought of a slice of bread made me heave but I could eat toast and bread rolls. (I put that down to eating a sandwich when having my first chemo??!!)  I went off vegetables but found I could eat them if I covered them in a cheesy white sauce (like cauliflower cheese). Through fec I was knocking back cup a soups as I found them tasty and  I tended to want greasy food like lamb chops. The T part was worse for me  but  I found I could eat crispy foods, but not crisps, such as breaded fish and  chicken kiev and tomato based foods such as baked beans, sweet chilli sauce, tomato soup tomato salsa and tortillas and I would be lost without mature cheddar.  I  hope you found this helpful, although we are all different, make sure you drink plenty of fluids when having chemo.   I only drink pop as a mixer with alcohol usually but as I have gone off water, tea and coffee I have had to buy in plenty of squash and hot chocolate. Good luck with the rest of your Chemo it will soon be over..",

I was put on anti-biotics for slight runny nose which I put down to losing hair up my nose as read it could cause irritation and runny nose, I only told nurse as I was attending an appointment anyway, but the antibiotics cleared it up straightaway, so my self diagnosis was way off, I was more comfortable when it was sorted. I would keep an eye on your temperature and get your tickly cough checked out, you need to make sure it doesn't get a grip and become worse, its such a pain I know I'm the last one to seek Doctors help but the first to recommend it but when you are having chemo you have to get the Doctors involved.

She just kept putting it off but she was making herself ill with worry. Finally she went to GP and got appt at Breast clinic and the next time I saw her she had been and got the all clear, I knew as soon as I saw her as she was back to her old self and didn't look ill and grey, she was so thankful I'd pushed her to get it checked as the fear was stopping her live her life she couldn't get it out her head. Well I hope I didn't need to type all that out as I hope you you have been to your GP and pushed for check up at Breast Clinic.  If not please do it first thing tomorrow. All the Best x",

I am facing left mastectomy and making a decision to have either a nipple sparing mastectomy or lumpectomy to the right breast. I will be put on Tamoxifen and I understand that radiotherapy will follow if I have lumpectomy but may not with mastectomy. As if that\u2019s not enough there is then the dilemma of which reconstruction to have, which I'll address in another post.   I keep changing my mind as to whether to have mastectomy or lumpectomy. Aaaargh.   I'm hoping for any information that you lovely ladies can share about your experiences. Especially ladies who may have had a mastectomy and lumpectomy at the same time. Can the outcome of different procedures give a good result that looks acceptable? I am even more concerned as I am a larger lady and was told that if I have an implant it wouldn't be as big as my current size. I have since asked about a lift and reduction to my left breast if I have lumpectomy which my BC nurse said was possible. Hmm!   Does a nipple sparing mastectomy leave you with good sensation, or is it more about the end look?   I have got loads of questions so any information is greatly appreciated.",

It hasn't all come out, I haven't much hair left and what I have is silver grey which stands up on end.   I look like a dandelion clock.  I am so glad I didn't have my head shaved as catching site of myself in the mirror makes me giggle, I think this fluffy look on me is funny.  When I go out I generally wear hats or scarves and having a little bit of hair to pull down over my forehead makes me feel a bit more normal.  I also have a fringe on a headband which I wear rather than wearing my nhs wig,  which is really very good as it matched the colour I used to dye my hair, but better as has highlights which makes it look like an expensive dye job, and it is the short style which really suits me. Just to mention a lady I met with alopecia recommended Watermans hairgrowth shampoo and conditioner which you can check out on their website and buy on Amazon.  I'm still having chemo so haven't tried it myself yet. good luck to everyone with your treatment xx",

I understand its harder losing weight due to medication and menopause but you can do it sensibly.  I googled green coffee beans as never heard of them and chlorgenic acid and as I guessed they are laxatives I am not a believer in claims of miracle cures someone is making an awful lot of money out of our desperation to lose weight and be healthy.   When I go home I will continue to make meal plans and watch portion sizes which is my downfall and I get hungry in the evening and eat everything in sight.  We are all different but I found the Hairy Bikers diet books gave me tasty food that I like to eat and easy to cook in batches.I lost half a stone before my diagnosis, I used their recipes and a loosely worked on reducing my calorie intake.  I hope you find a way to lose weight that suits you soon, as I know its frustrating.

I feel very lucky that I have only had mild side effects but the tiredness eats at you.  I did too much yesterday and was  overtired and got tearful over nothing ( I bumped into my new neighbour and couldn't remember her name and got upset) which is so unlike me.  I find its harder to cope with everything when I'm tired so make sure you get plenty of rest. You are a mum I'm sure you could give me advice on getting organised, so do prepare to have bad days but you will have plenty of good days to.  When you get a date you will be able to feel more in control because you can make plans and will know what other appointments you need to attend, I went for a blood test and CT scan and ECG. Before chemo I cleaned my house from top to bottom, I made batches of meals which I froze and stocked up on non perishable groceries so I didn't need to go to supermarkets so often.  I bought in crystalised ginger and fresh ginger, ginger nuts and arrowroot biscuits also I found lemon/ fruit sherberts good to suck when I'm out. After I saw the nurse who went through common side effects she suggested I get Imodium and corsodyl mouthwash and an ear thermometer which I bought and later added Gaviscon as I suffered with heartburn. You will get through  this and we are all here to help.  Now go and do something fun to take your mind off it.  xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi to everyone Its time to for me join your lovely club, I've been following your posts  so feel like I know you all.  I love the all the comments good or bad it has helped me prepare for my treatment. Sylvie 64 your post struck a chord with me  because I was preparing to hibernate for days 6 to 11 so  that made me smile to now you are day 12 and  have come out of hiding feeling well.  Good luck with cold cap. I will be having FEC-T over 6 cycles. I had my first chemo yesterday and the side effects I have had is my left foot is swollen and I feel like I have bubbles in my throat almost like I should burp but I can't force them up into a burp they just bubble up my throat-  I have very mild feelings that come and go of face feeling hot but not perspiring (not flushing), very slight sickly headache and ever so slightly queasy before meal times. I have nothing to complain about so far so good. My saviour has been crystalised ginger and an infusion of fresh chopped ginger, honey and drop of lemon juice I made a jug yesterday with hot water and then sipped it when it was cold throughout the evening and when I woke in the night.  Will make a fresh batch this evening. I know I am on only on day 2 but I was expecting to be so much worse.  I am still preparing for the worse so getting into a routine of taking the meds, keeping a diary, taking my temperature and drinking lots of water and taking it easy and doing it with a smile. Best wishes to you all and to everyone due to start the worst is not knowing what to expect, I wish you luck and minimal side effects. xx",

      "Content": "Hi my beauty therapist suggested Wella Recharging hair/scalp serum.  I haven't tried this as have only just started chemo. Good luck with the hair regrowth. I'm glad the cold cap worked for you. I decided not to use the cold cap it I think going to a Macmillan headlines meeting helped me decide as the ladies showed me how to tie head scarves in different ways.  I was pleased with how I looked in them, so decided it was one less worry to think about if I prepared myself to lose all my hair as I know I would be in the mirror everyday checking it wasn't thinning.  I may have thought differently if I was having treatment in summer as I think I can get away with hats scarves and wigs in the coming colder months, more because I haven't told neighbours or friends I don't see regularly but could bump into.. x",

      "Content": "Hi gratefulkate. I had a central line put in through my neck into main vein to heart, had local anaesthetic no sedation, procedure took half an hour and I walked out 20 minutes later on my own (I was picked up as  not recommended to drive).  The next day neck felt bruised and little swollen inside my neck which made me breathe a bit heavy and my voice was a little harder to push out when talking a lot so I would say depending on what you  do you may be fine going to work. Of course you may not be having port in this area and I have a tube coming out of me which is kept under a clear dressing, which has to be flushed weekly, but I presume the insertion is similar although aftercare is different as port is under the skin. Apart from having to go to hospital each week, I am grateful for having my line in its so easy to have chemo and blood tests.  I had the line as I have had double mastectomy and lymph node clearance on each side so can't use arms safely for injections. Hope you don't mind me replying I'm sure someone with a port will be along soon to tell you more accurately about their experience with having a port. all the best x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone,  I'm day 10 on first FECT cycle and have come out the other side having had 1 bout of diarrhoea, I didn't feel ill with it.  I do  feel it was my own fault for having pepporoni pizza not the wisest choice, I think it was a bit too greasy but I enjoyed it. I took 2 Imodium and I was right as rain the next day. Just to let you know happy mum you can live your life as normal but its so tempting to hide away, I think you just have to take precautions and maybe make a few adjustment and preparations before you start chemo.  For the first 8 days after chemo I was tired and didn't feel like doing anything,  I had naps in the afternoon and slept like a log at night as well.  I have cooked meals each day but have some home made frozen meals to turn to if I don't fancy cooking.  I live on my own, you will probably have more motivation to do everyday things with having your family round you but do listen to your body and if you need a nap take one. Have you had your preassessment appointment with a nurse this is where I was given a lot of answers about the side effects and it sounds like you haven't had this discussion yet or have they said something that has made you so petrified? Are you worried about the treatment or the after effects?  Sorry third degree I know just wondering what would be helpful. I wish I could take away some of your fear xx",

I feel for you losing your hair I am sorry you didn't get better results from the cold cap.  I've got two wigs and lots of head scarves and just ordered a fringe on a headband to wear under hats and scarves and some big flashy earrings  I'm trying to be positive but still can't believe I'm going to lose my hair.  sending you a hug and hope you start to feel better soon.",

I'm also having Fec-T I had steroid tablets for 3 days and the nurse kindly drew a diagram of when to take and how many to take as I gave her a blank look when she was explaining how to take as the dose altered and how often each day,  I was tired and couldn't take it in but was grateful when I came to take them, a diagram was so much simpler to follow. I wasn't given the injections though I had been aware of them,  I am glad you confirmed you could get them springloaded I'm sure I could cope with that.  Best wishes to everyone hope tomorrow a better day xx",
