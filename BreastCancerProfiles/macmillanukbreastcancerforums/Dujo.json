      "Content": "Hi, I would be really interested in knowing what brand you now use? I have been taking Tamoxifen for around six months and my side effects include: pressure headaches, tingling of my face and lips, sore teeth and a runny nose! My sister who has also had breast cancer takes the same tablets and has had no side effects at all! I also take B12 and Iron tablets and wonder if they might be causing a reaction? I am not sure I can continue for 3 years like this? ",
