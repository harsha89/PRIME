    "Content": "You have encouraged me a lot Sarah. I am concerned that I have several other health issues, disabled because of a bad hip replacement being one of them. I am also full of Osteoarthritis suffer with Diverticulitis and have Macular Degeneration which is steadily impairing my sight. I have hardly any friends left. Those I have cannot drive, can't walk much and so would not be in a position to help. Do Macmillan or Marie Curie help at all in these situations? I am dreading it actually. I have lways been independent and an optimist but must admit I am feeling rather defeated at the moment.",
