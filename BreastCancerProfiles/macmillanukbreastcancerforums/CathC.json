      "Content": "I have been on tamoxifen for three years and am struggling with side effects. Onc has prescribed Venlafaxine to help but I am wary of taking it as it is an anti-depressant with the related side effects. He has said if the Venlafaxine doesn't help then he may stop the tamoxifen early - after three and a half years rather than five. I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has experience of taking venlafaxine or who has stopped the tamoxifen early. ( I have also had surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and herceptin)",

      "Content": "Thanks Kate, I have had a long chat with my breast nurse today and we have decided I will come off the tamoxifen for six weeks. This should give me a good idea whether the symptoms I am having are side effects of the tamoxifen or whether the chemo has pushed me into an early menopause. A bit scary after nearly three and a half years....wish me luck!",
