      "Content": "Hi. this is my first post on this site but I really need some help and advice. A few weeks ago my best friend, who is only 35, was diagnosed with a very agressive breast cancer. Her chances aren't great. She starts chemo this week and I desperately want to get her something that will help with the side effects - any ideas anybody? She has my support and all the positivity I can muster and it goes without saying she will continue to get this but I want to buy her something that will either make her smile and feel loved, help her to feel better or, preferably, BOTH! I have spent weeks trying to think of something so any ideas would be appreciated more than you can imagine",

We used to spend hours in the car (years ago) singing out loud to absolute trash - Whitney Houston, Dirty Dancing - you get the idea. that will make her laugh. And annoy her hubbie who has just blown up his ipod! Thank you so much - it's a wonderful idea that combines passing the time and making her feel good. Thank you xxxxx",

      "Content": "So, I'm guessing that as she is going to have chemo every two weeks she's never going to be able to taste much? Fortunately she doesn't drink alcohol anyway and doesn't particualrly like spicy food. Please tell me she can still drink tea - she lives on the stuff! All this advice is invaluable - thank you so much. I know I keep saying thank you but I want to be the best support possible for her - I will do anything to help her through this. My boss said to me that I should support her and let everyone else around me worry about supporting me. She knows I share her anxiety and her fear but I very much believe that in most circumstances, she shouldn't see it.",

      "Content": "I went to see my best friend yesterday following her first chemo session on Thursday. I thought she'd be a lot worse although her husband tells me that my visit has really brightened her up. Her overwhelming side effect was nausea and dizziness although she's still in a lot of pain from the surgery to insert the ports. We managed to walk to the end of the road and back. She's having terrible problems sleeping even with the sleeping tablets she's been given but is prone to nodding off at odd times of the day.",

      "Content": "If the truth be known I feel so helpless. It's been a rollercoaster. Six weeks from first finding the lump to starting chemo. Each bit of news, each visit to the specialists, brought worse and worse news. I have not been able to talk out loud about any of this yet. Thank you so much for your kindness - sometimes perhaps you forget that the feelings you're experiencing are not unique. I know difficult times are ahead. I'm getting married next August and I feel like I should postpone as I want to give her my undivided attention - but I know that would upset her - she's upset enough at the prospect of not being able to walk down the aisle behind me as it is. I truly hope you make a full recovery. xxxx",

I will send her texts and emails and not worry if I don't hear anything back - I know if anything was seriously wrong (!) her hubbie would let me know. I also don't ring her. I know she has a string of calls but she doesn't always want to talk so I leave her to call me when she wants to. I know that the next few months are going to be incredibly difficult for her.",

      "Content": "Thanks Jools. We're all totally devastated but I save my falling apart moments for when she's not around. Unfortunately, I live almost 80 miles away from her but my boss is very understanding and is happy for me to spend a night a week with her and her husband even though this will mean leaving work early and arriving late the next day. Of course, there are weekends too. I would go to the end of the earth for her - I like to think that together we can fight it and that whilst she's the one that has to go through the treatment it's the only thing she has to do on her own.",

      "Content": "There is so much to learn! I know she will have nausea, headaches and mouth ulcers but not able to taste anything - I didn't know that! I try to be there for her but always in the background. She knows I will go to chemo with her if her hubbie can't - or even if she wants both of us to - but I try not to intrude. I know there are people who phone all the time to see how she is - and I know it's tiring, depressing and intrusive. I try to listen, not to belittle her fears, even if they are irrational, to support her but not be over-bearing. She does however have long term thoughts and fears. I get married next year and she is one of my bridesmaids. On this subject I don't feel I can win. I have told her she can tell me she can't manage it at any time. BUT, I don't want to leave her out of plans until she does so because I know she is focusing on being there. On the other hand, I don't want to put her under any pressure to do it if she's not up to it. I have talked all this through with her but I don't think I can help. She has to make the right decision. The only thing I can do - and have done - is to make her see that I want what she wants and whatever she does, I will support her and respect that decision. Thrup, thank you for everything you say. I am like a sponge at the moment, absorbing everything. I just want to be the best friend I can be to her.",
