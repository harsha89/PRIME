      "Content": "Good morning Dreamthief.  Thank you for your reassuring words. I think the shock of what could potentially be ahead for my wife is what I\u2019m finding hard. Logic tells me she will probably be fine, yet the mind monkey is playing his tricks. My wife is very nervous but keeps it in. She\u2019s not told anyone what\u2019s going on. Her breast screening appt wasn\u2019t until the 25th so we\u2019ve decided to go private for the initial scan and biopsy (if needed). It\u2019s this Friday. It\u2019s going to be a long few days for sure!! I hope your wife continues to do well.  Thank you. ",

      "Content": "I\u2019ve been panic stricken over the last few days since my wife found a lump in her breast. GP has referred her to a breast clinic. Everything I read online seems to point to a late stage cancer. I know we have to wait until she sees a consultant but I thought I would post on here in the hope of some reassurance. She\u2019s seeming so brave, it\u2019s me who keeps crumbling. Trying so hard to appear normal in front of our daughter. Anyway, my wife is 48 and has a hard 2cm grape shaped lump at the bottom of her breast (6 o\u2019clock). It appears to have defined edges and moves slightly, but not much. She also had an unrelated blood test last week that showed she has a very Vitamin B12 level (this seems possibly related to cancer of the liver). Any thoughts I\u2019d be grateful to read them. I have to appear strong for her but am going crazy with worry. Thank you. ",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, Well doctor told her she has a \u2018large\u2019 malignant tumour (GP reckoned it was 2cm but we are guessing it\u2019s more likely in the 2-5 range, don\u2019t know what exactly is considered \u2018large\u2019, annoyed we didn\u2019t ask), but it\u2019s confined to the breast, and there\u2019s no sign of it in the nodes. This was based on ultrasound and mammogram. She is having core biopsy on Monday.  Trying to stay positive, at least the likelihood of it being high stage is reduced if the nodes are unaffected (I think).  Andy x",
