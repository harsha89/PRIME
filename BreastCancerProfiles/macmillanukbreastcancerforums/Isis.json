      "Content": "I got the Herbatint dye and once i had used Lee Stafford's Hair Growth Treatment to moisturise and heal my scalp for a few weeks then i felt i could use it and not cause much harm to my scalp n fingers crossed hair would cope. I had it in my drawer for a month or so before i had the guts to use it, but when i used it and it turned out fine, even though i was mid chemo. I got told it could come out a different colour as your on treatment and was scared it would turn out green or something but it was fine. If your scalp is in good condition and you think your hair could handle it then its mainly up to you. I saught the advice of the girls at the Maggies Centre before i made my decision. Good Luck!
