      "Content": "Hello everyone, my mum is currently having radiotherapy after being diagnosed with a grade 3 stage 3 DC in October last year. She had a lumpectomy and WLE because she had 4 lymph nodes affected. She had ECT chemotherapy and has started on Letrozole which, so far, doesn't seem to be causing her any problems. Soon after starting radiotherapy (she's had 11 of 15+5) she developed a nagging pain at the top of her back on treatment side and similar in same side shoulder especially at night.  She said she was lay in a very uncomfortable position for quite a long time during first few visits with her arm raised above her head and still has to lie this way daily. I know she is a bit worried about this (been googling bone mets in shoulder) but I think it's probably just muscle strains from lying in this awkward position. She is quite a fit, active 54 year old who uses that arm daily using a ball thrower to entertain our dogs. Has anyone else experienced similar?  Thank you. ",
