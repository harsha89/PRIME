    "Content": "Hi there, I had first of three doses of Docetaxel on 18th may, two days later soles of feet were raw and very tender, then followed four days of barely being able to walk, intense pain like they were on fire, with joint pain as well. Now soles of feet feel leathery and strangely numb. I was told to limit walking and hot baths etc as heat and friction can worsen leakage of the chemo out of capillaries into hands and feet and affect nerves . Inside of my nose is raw, sound like I have cold with cough and gravelly voice, thrush ( after further steroids to try to manage feet ) subsiding thankfully, no energy and very teary. Definitely ask oncologist for help to manage side affects, I have used px Zopiclone to help sleep which has been effective, and Dicloflex and Amitriptyline (just started two nights ago) to help manage pain and inflammation in joints. Have never been one to take lots of meds (stoic nurse ! ) however for me it is essential to enable me to get through. Best of wishes to you .    ",
