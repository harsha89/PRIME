      "Content": "Hi  Well obviously everyone is different so we all recover differently, and I had a reconstruction at the same time.  I also had my surgery done privately so have been looked after really really well.  I had mastectomy and recon on 30 June, it was a 9 hour operation so not something to be sniffed at.  I woke up in a very warm room with a nurse with me all the time for a good 10 hours.  However this was because of the reconstruction.  He used my tummy tissue to make a new breast which because the vessels have to be plumbed in you are keep very warm for 24\\48 hours to make the vessels pump harder to keep tissue alive.  However you dont need to worry about that.  I came out of hospital on the 8th day, I have full movement of my right arm.  There are things I was told not to do like stretching, bending etc, but again some of this is due to having a scar from left to right hip. I also came home with a drain which I had until it fell out on 23 July (after a day trip to London!), but that was in my stomach.  The chest drain came out 2 days after operation. Night time is probably the worst I have had to lie on my back - because of the new breast I cannot lie on my right but I do not think that should be too big a problem for you, you will be given plenty of pain killers - I only have paracetamol and ibroprfen as like you have a good pain thresh hold.    I did buy one of those v shaped pillows which has really helped, as I cannot lie flat. So i am now 4 weeks on and although i get tired, I do pretty much every thing, and I am driving as well - although probably shouldn't be!!  The only thing i really struggle with is putting the washing on a line as I do not wish to stretch fully.   If i can answer any other questions please do not hesitate to get in touch.  Best wishes - all will be fine, take each days as it comes and do not expect miracles your body needs time to heal and only you will know when you are ready to do different things!   xx",

      "Content": "Hi Jelly I wanted to say I had my first Docetaxel on 16 August was also told I had to inject myself for 5 days Sat to Wed (had not been told prior to this).  I was told there could be some bone pain and to take Paracetamol and Ibroprofen prior to injections.  Which I did - I injected on Saturday morning, and was fine until bed time when the pain started to kick in despite painkillers.  By Sunday I was going out of my mind - I have not know pain like it and I usually have a high pain threshold.  On the Monday I rang mychemo line who told me to not do injection until the evening and take para and ibro every four hours and then inject around 6pm.  She also said to get some co-codomol which is a stronger paracetamol.  This I did and gave up the paracetamol and took co-codomol instead (you cannot take both - or you will overdose on paracetamol).  This really helped and helped me manage the pain until after the series of injections.  I wish I had been told how severe the pain might be prior to the injection, I would have then made sure i took painkillers every 4 hours prior to first injection.   Upshot it, ensure you are stocked up on painkillers - get your doctor to prescribe co-codomol and start take 24 prior to injections.  Of course it may not be as bad for you as we are all different, but just wanted to give some advice. For me they have now changed my injection to one I have to do on second day, and that is all - and the bone pain is not meant to be as bad.  Here is hoping my next chemo is Thursday (injection Friday)... best wishes ",

      "Content": "Thank you that is really reassuring.  My veins are shot (always suffered as a child), but they are worse now due to the chemo in 2008. I had a hicc line inserted about half way through treatment last time, but my body rejected it, it was so painful having it inserted that I do not really wish to repeat.  I am currently recovering from mastectomy and reconstruction using tummy tissue - which has taken me awhile to come to terms with - I feel like frankenstein's monster to be honest, but then not many people get a boob job and a tummy tuck for their 50th birthday, lol.   Regards",

      "Content": "Hi I had the microbubble test - it is nothing to worry about.  They inject some liquid (not sure what) just near the nipple, then using an ultrasound they can track the bubbles along to the sentinal lympnode.  You can watch it all as you do not need to be knocked out.  It didnt work for me as I had previously had 3 nodes removed and the scaring from operation in 2008 prevented the bubbles getting to the lymphnodes.  However if you have not had previous treatment they can trace the bubbles along to the lymphnodes and do a biopsy which is better than having an operation.  So if it is offered go for it.  It is a relatively new way of checking the nodes. Good luck - keep us posted.  xx",

Please get it checked out with your breast care nurses.  I had a hard lump after my lumpectomy in 2008.  I had my routine mammograms each year and in 2011 they took a closer look and said it was scar tissue and nothing to worry about, and that no one would mention it again.  However during my 2012 mammogram they found that the cancer had returned in that hard scar tissue area.  I had been told they had removed all the cancer in 2008 so this was somewhat of a shock.   I am sure your hard area is just scar tissue and nothing to worry about - but please get it checked out.",

I had mastectomy on 30 June using tummy tissue, however the scars did not heal properly and as I decided to have chemo, surgeon decided to do a tidy up operation on 25 june. I had first chemo last Thursday but am still worried that a small 10p size of the breast scar does not appear to be healing. Whatever I put dressings wise seems to remove any healed skin when I change the dressings. Now worried having started chemo how I am going to resolve this!! I have made appointment at doctors tomorrow so hopefully she can give me a solution. Hilary",
