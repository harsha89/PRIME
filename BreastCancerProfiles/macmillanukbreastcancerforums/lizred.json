    "Content": "Hi Scarlettred its not exactly the same situation but I had a mx for high grade DCIS (and immediate recon) last year but no sign of spread to lymph nodes etc. When the histology came back the DCIS had gone right to the edge of the breast tissue and there was less than a 1mm clear margin in what had been removed (where it would have sat under the skin). Initially the MDT came up with 3 options - further surgery to remove the area of skin, radiotherapy (which would affect my implant), or tamoxifen (and cross my fingers) - the decision was then up to me. I felt unable to make a choice and instead had a second opinion where the consultant I saw said there was no indication breast tissue had been left behind so she didn't feel any of those options was needed. In short, I don't know the answer for your particular situation but, if you are not sure about what is being suggested, do ask for a second opinion or whether any other options would be considered. x",
