      "Content": "Hi, I had similar treatment to you FEC-T and started herceptin with the doxatacel. I also had the injections to help boost my bone marrow to produce white cells. I found that whilst on the doxatacel regime I got strange pains a bit like stabbing as you say. It was a bit unnerving but the stabbing pains only lasted a few seconds and didn't happen that often. I got a lot of aches it felt like my bones actually ached. I remember waking at night with what felt like stabbing pains. I got advice from my chemo unit and oncologist about painkillers because I was concerned about painkillers masking a high temperature. I had a neutropenic episode on my first  FEC. My temp did go up whilst on doxatacel but blood tests showed I was OK. I was eventually prescribed Morphine which helped a bit. The aches for me lasted from about day 4 to about day 9.  I was told on more than one occasion don't suffer in silence. So phone your chemo unit or help line or breast care nurse to put your mind at rest. All the best. xx",

All my bloods were taken from there and on the two occasions I had neutropenia and I needed  intravenous antibiotics it was a godsend and life saver. So I had a love/hate relationship with my PICC line and when it was finally removed when my last chemo had been given I felt quite emotional. So Thank-you PICC line. The sleeves provided are poor and the lumpy bits do dig in and showering all difficult, I was given a shower cover by the technician at the hospital so don't know why this isn't standard practice??  All the best. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a PICC line for nearly five months and had loads of blood pressures done and the cuff was always placed over the  PICC line. I queried it a couple of times but it seemed to be normal practice. I don't seem to have suffered any effects from this.  The hardest thing with these lines is trying to shower. I had a cover which was awkward to put on and then most of the time held that arm away from the shower. The other thing which was a real drag was the sleeve they put over the  PICC line. It kept rolling up so it ended up slightly pinching the skin which worked me. I tried different sizes but to no avail. I looked on the Internet for alternatives but never actually purchased anything. I'd be interested to know if there are any better ones than the things dished out by the hospital. Hope all goes well with you. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I joined this site last week so hello. I've actually finished my main treatment except for Herceptin injections every three weeks so in a way I see myself in recovery. I had a lumpectomy in December last year then 6 cycles of chemo followed by 4 weeks of radiotherapy which finished 4 weeks ago. So here I am sitting here wondering what the hell has happened to me over the last 7 months! Instead of happily getting on with things I feel in a daze. What a roller coaster of a journey, no wonder I feel emotionally battered and bruised. I don't think I have ever dealt with anything quite so tough and difficult in my life before.  Fortunately I've read a brilliant article by Dr Peter Harvey called After the Treatment Finishes, Then What? It's download able on the Web.  It made me realise that it's only now that what has happened to me is starting to sink in!  And I realise it's going to take time to recover and find some sort of normality and piece together my life again. Some days I feel quite down and want to do nothing others I want to race around to make the most of life. I feel loads better than I did after chemo (FEC-T) and radiotherapy was a breeze by comparison.  My hair is beginning to grow back, I have some eyelashes making an appearance and some eyebrows also. My nails still look as though they have been run over by a bus but some signs of new growth. So physically things are improving, I think it's the emotional trauma that will take a bit longer.  Fortunately I have a very good BCN and also local cancer support centre to help but it's tough all the same. So this is my story this far.  Oh, I've found doing an audio diary really good.  So all in all I'm getting there.",

      "Content": "I think cancer is life changing and a wakeup call. I finished treatment four months ago although I'm still getting herceptin injections.  It has made me re-evaluate things. I'm retired so have time to think! It's tough at times to know what I want to do from now on. I know I am so pleased to have finished treatment and come out the other side.  Most days I think wow this is lovely I'm free to do what I want and when.  I still have dark times when I wonder what the hell has happened to me. I still don't know what exactly I want from life but I do now cherish every day because I'm relieved I've got through the treatment and I'm sort of getting back to normal but it's a normal with the backdrop of having had cancer and hope it never returns. I certainly don't think you are mad, do whatever it takes to get through treatment and come out the other side. Good luck with everything you do.  Best wishes, Diana.",
