I really understand how difficult it is to put yourself first but sometimes it just has to be done! I was in a really difficult situation when I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago! I was a carer for both my mum and husband! Told all the medical team I was far too busy to have cancer! Fortunately they talked to me and I had the necessary treatment an I'm here to tell the tale! Mum had to go into a nursing home and other people helped my husband! Have the treatment they suggest now! After Christmas things might be worse and you'd still need the treatment! Get it done and out of the way! Take care gill. X x x",

However now's the time to put yourself first and without considering anyone else do the right thing for you! Tough I know but if you don't you could be unnecessarily shortening your life! Forget about past mistakes for now! If you haven't confidence in your breast care team then ask for a second opinion! If you need help with the children contact social service's/ friends and family! Just imagine if one of your children was putting off treatment for something really serious for 4 months! How would you feel what advice would you give her? Take care! Good luck on the journey and I'm sure you'll do the right thing! Gill x",

Had mastectomy and I didn't nee chemo or radiotherapy just tamoxifen for 10 years! I'm due my 2nd yearly mammogram later this month! I do not at this point have secondary breast cancer but if that does develop can be treated for many years!

The type of chemo does not destroy bone marrow (which produces blood cells) so even though they drop for a bit and your more at risk of all infections , once they increase again you would still have immunity to all the really bad diseases! Good luck + fingers crossed you wont,catch anything \" unwanted\"  GILL Xxx",

You sound like a very educated + capable person who has been set off course by illness and you need help but on your terms! I think you need to be more assertive + specific when it comes to either asking for or accepting help from others! Tell people if there not being helpful \"politely\" and if they truly care they'll understand! If you want the bathroom painting then get it done! It's your house! Take back control! You'll feel better! Love + best wishes gill x",

I suppose if your lucky enough to be near a larger hospital they have more to offer! I must say I fee like I never put nearly enough time and effort into the whole research thing when I was diagnosed 2 years ago! Same type of cancer as yourself! I simply went Down the mastectomy route! No questions asked!  Could I ask (and you don't have to say if you prefer not to)! But why did you not think a mastectomy was the best approach at the time for yourself? I'm starting to doubt my ow choices now! Take care and good luck with planned treatment! Gill x x x",

I remember speaking to my breast nurse about side effects and the negative things I'd read in this site and she said usually only people post on here who are actually having problems! When I thought about it it makes sense really! So I suppose the vast majority of people have manageable side effects and think it's worthwhile taking! You can always stop it at any stage if your not happy! Gill x",

      "Content": "Hi Ella 70! In reply to your post about telling people about your diagnosis then everyone does this in their own way! No right or wrong! I decided to tell the people who needed to know like very close family and friends then everyone else would find out gradually over time or maybe never know! Again it depends on your willingness to share very personal info on-line! Don't get me wrong social media is great for most things but just not sure it's the right forum for telling a wide circle of people you have cancer! I've read loads of stories in news + from meeting people and lots of people do still choose to be selective in who they tell! I personally did not want to make people feel they had to get in touch solely because of my diagnosis! This worked for me but I think what you have to decide is do you want well meaning folk talking to you about your health every time you meet or speak to them! I found I needed days where I switched off and forgot about the whole thing sometimes! Good luck in whatever you decide and I hope your treatment going s well! Gill x x x",

I take wockhardt! Nowhere near as  many side effects as other brands I've tried! Do you still take any anti sickness tabs! Might be worth asking your GP for some to tide you over till things settle down! Also I know we all need to pay the bills but if your really struggling consider a break from work if it's possible!

I've tried everywhere for bras and have come to the conclusion that amoena is  by far the best! However I only buy bras + matching knickers in the sale! Because it's an unusual size they always seem to have plenty of 32c in sale! It just means stocking up when there available! On the plus side I have a couple of larger breasted friends who have both had mastectomy with no recon  and they always comment on the weight of their prosthesis ( especially in summer)!

Maybe try upping the dose before you go to bed and don't lie flat! ( easier said than done) as I'm forever falling off pillows + ending up lying flat! On a more serious note acid reflux is a definite risk factor in developing oesophogeal problems including sadly cancer so do try + get it sorted! Take care gill x x x",
