      "Content": "Hi there When I had my Grade 2 breast lump removed it was by 'wide angle incision' rather than a hole refilled with body fat. Basically I have a scar line and then another where the nodes were removed for testing. The breast that was was operated on is actually quite pert, following radiotherapy, and at the moment the other one is slightly dipping southwards but I notice, tho others dont seem to. My Consultant has offered to do something with the 'southfacing' one if it starts to bother me. At the moment Ive got sizeable breasts anyway due to the Tamoxifen I was on which made me gain lots of weight; Ive now switched to Arimidex. Its this that bothers me more than the scars. Suggest you discuss your anxieties with your medics; Im sure they'll be able to help and put your mind at rest. Love and Luck x        ",

Where are you?. I assume they would fill the area up with your own fat? Or you may have to live with this. My boob still feels very foreign to me still. Xxx",

I was in hospital with an infection in my new boob and that knocked me for six. My wound is still getting dressed weekly. Also a couple of seromas too!! It's a big op. My surgeon said when we do the nipple and other breast (uplift)  he could do lippo suction on my  other side  so it would match the less fatty operated side up. Please feel free to ask me anything if you think I could help. Big hug xx",

I myself dont have cancer but my husband does and is having his lymph glands in his groin removed soon and like you when he found out he cryed all day thinking about our 3 children, but then was quite calm as if it wasnt happening. Its like he is in denial but he knows theres a journey ahead and to stay postitive. Good luck with pre-op tests on friday and if you need a chat this is a great place to talk to people.
