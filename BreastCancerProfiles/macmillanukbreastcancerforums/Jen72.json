      "Content": "Hi, I am in a similar poistion, had surgery on 12th Feb. Saw my surgeon on 2nd March. She advise me to have my tissue tested to see if chemo would be beneficial to me  My lymph nodes and tissues were clear of cancer so I don't need anymore surgery. I find out next Monday for my results. I don't know what grade or stage my cancer is at, she didn't say, but she said years ago chemo would be the next treatment for my type of cancer (wished I asked now).  Do I take the risk and not have chemo if the risks are on the borderline? Everything is a waiting game, but I suppose they know what they are doing and want to know 100% before they give out the facts. Hope your results go well. Jen x",

      "Content": "Got a sick note from doc for my surgery for the last two weeks I had off. I have my referral next Wednesday. We were discussing my work and I said as I have got breast cancer they cannot discriminate me by law (i.e make me redundant because of it). He said I haven't got cancer anymore as I had the lump removed last week so they can. So bascially any futher treatment I may need in the future will not be class of having breast cancer unless it comes back.  I was quite put off by his remark.  He said he had to live with me and my \"cancer\" (wait for it...since 25th of Jan and he only had one day off from work for my surgery on 12th Feb)  so he knows what cancer is like.  Nothing really has changed for him, ok he took the dog for a walk, cleaned my guinea pig hutch, did the ironing and vacuuming (its not like he hasn't done this before the surgery).  Yes I had some pain and still am in pain, but this hasn't affected his life or the running of the household. Apart from my family and line manager I haven't mentioned it to anyone. I don't think he has told his family and non of our friends know. The only people I really talk about it is you lot on this forum.  I went to to all my other appointments on my own. My sister said she will come with me to my next one. Yes its true the lump has gone, and hoping it stays gone, but he doesn't realise the emotional aspects of it all.  He just wants me to forget it and move on, I haven't had radiotherapy yet!!  On the good side my brother (who has bowel and liver cancer) has told me you get free carpark at the hospital if you have chemo or radiotherapy yay.  Anyway rant over, its probably me being too emotional",

He told my youngest we are going camping in Easter. I said we are not 100% sure what treatment I need yet but he thinks a few blast of radiotherapy and all be OK. I am hoping the same, but I now I worried letting my daughter down if treatment concise with Easter. I think he is an ostrich. I'm just going to leave him to it got enough to worry about. ",

If the shoe was on the other foot it would be different case all together.  He like a Jekyll and Hyde. I am going in give Maggies a ring tomorrow. ",

      "Content": "My score was 22 so in the low side of the middle. I was diagnosed grade 3, 38mm ER+. There is a lot of cancer in my family so I wanted to give it everything I got as I my youngest daughter is only 10. My parents wanted me to try everything possible too. My BC nurse said you take a year out of your life to give the rest of your life. Got my fourth chemo today, not looking forward to it, but I got a bit of phobia about being sick. Chemo is not easy but I wanted to know I've gave it my all. Before the test was available  I would be having chemo anyway, if my family never had it I probably think differently. It all depends on your own personal circumstances. I don't think there is a right/wrong decision so don't feel guilty whatever you decide. Good luck, hope it all goes well. ",

My children was there so I had to make out it was OK with smiles but I was crying inside. I've got one chemo treatment left, will my hair grow back, what colour. How long will I need to wear head scarves for. My eyebrows are thinning but eyelashes, for now, are OK. My husband shaves his head in the summer but his hair grows back normal. I have a little fluff. I appreciate the reasoning of the fund raising but they make it sound that chemo is easy. The emotional impact of hair loiss, fatigue, nausea, low moods, joint pain is horrible. I don't think anyone will understand unless they been through it themselves. ",
