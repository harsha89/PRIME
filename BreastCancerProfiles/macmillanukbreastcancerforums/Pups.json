      "Content": "I had 15 sessions of radiotherapy in January/February after 6 sessions of FEC-T and surgery and it was a doddle, but I do realise everyone is different.  Keeping your arms in the correct position for long enough can make your shoulders ache, but keep exercising and it will be OK.  I was given some cream by the radiotherapy staff to use twice a day and didn't notice too much change in my skin.  I've got a slight bit of redness, pointed out by physio yesterday, but I hadn't noticed it as it's really small.  There was only one day when I actually felt a bit tired, but I had a snooze and was fine after.  I felt quite proud that I'd coped OK, after becoming side effect central while having chemo and then developing lymphoedema!  Always look for the positive - that's my motto. Take care and I'm sure you'll be hunkydory.",

      "Content": "I developed a DVT in my left leg as a result of chemo and inactivity due to the chemo.  I've been doing daily injections of Tinzaparin since September, which do get me down even though it's just once a day, and I'm finally having a review of it at the start of May.  I think the DVT lot at the hospital forgot about me! My DVT started off feeling like the ache left after you've had cramp and I didn't take too much notice of it at first.  Over the next couple of days it got worse until the point that I could hardly walk.  What I want to know is why every time some new side effect happened during chemo or after surgery, why did it always happen at a weekend?!  Whilst the oncology staff at my hospital were fantastic, the A&E staff there were quite dismissive of anyone having chemo, so I would refuse to go in until the Monday.  DVT, chemo burn and phlebitis in the arm all waited until the Monday, despite the pain. Anyway, in a way I feel quite proud that I've managed to do the injections - never thought I could, but it was either do them myself or wait in EVERY day for a district nurse to come round.  No way!  Fingers crossed I'll be able to stop the injections soon and my leg hasn't hurt since soon after the first injection.  Hope you're doing well and yep, I just love the side effects;)  Maybe they're character building?!
