    "Content": "Hi Julie, i  39 and i was diagnosed last Friday - i am still writhing from the shock. I have to go back tomorow (thursday) to North Manchester to discuss treatment etc but this has been a very long week. I'm currently fluctuating between super positive and downright hysterical - i'm self employed so massive worries about finances are worrying me more (or maybe thats a defence against the real issues). Its a frightening time - i didn't read anything all weekend - just had a weep and got busy but i am now starting to read some info on here and in the pack given to me at the hospital and its quite scary how i am using terminology i had never head of 3 days ago! How life changes so quickly? I hope you are ok? I think its best if us newbies just keep reading and taking advice from others and keep talking. Unfortunately its all going to become very real for us but hopefully we can help each other? Good Luck hun x",
