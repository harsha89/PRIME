      "Content": "Thanx for the excellent advice, i have that much going on trying to keep my house going, working and looking after mum & dad. My hubby is a huge help. My dad helps as much as he can but he is limited to what he can do. He's disabled himself so i look after him aswell. I'm taking mum shopping on friday to get her out of the house so we will stock freezer. She loves baking so i will suggest doing extra for freezer. I will keep you posted.",
