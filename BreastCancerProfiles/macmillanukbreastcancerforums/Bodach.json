      "Content": "Hi all When I posted my version of this in both the  Ileostomy, colostomy and stoma support Bowel (colon and rectum) cancer I made reference to the fact that I had a medication withdrawn from my repeat prescription list by the Pharmacist. It was not a high street pharmacist who withdrew it BUT the Clinical Pharmacist employed by my GP surgery. I understand more and more GP practices are going along this route to oversee prescriptions issued and implement the local CCG interpretation of the non mandatory NHS England guidelines. Ian",

      "Content": "Hi cannon  You could try https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.ctauk.org/&ved=0ahUKEwj1vJvi_KPTAhVDB8AKHXkID8MQFggaMAA&usg=AFQjCNFFJOet2gkQlw24mDVzQ4CfwCZyVg&sig2=RFf2ah_Wi3yM3aN2aFqsOw By selecting the service you want (voluntary car service, community transport service) and your post code you should get a list of available car services and options for your area) Or the Royal voluntary service https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/get-help/getting-out-and-about/community-transport&ved=0ahUKEwit-Kzr_qPTAhXsI8AKHS-tCG0QFggbMAA&usg=AFQjCNG5kaCpWJcNwn7f46eqM2568_LD1g&sig2=wvF991xc7GL50oVPg8tkbg Depending on the area unless you could be classed as exempt a mileage charge is payable to the driver. In my area I pay either 45p or 60p per mile if the driver uses his own car. I also could use a shuttle service which runs between local hospitals and is shared with other people, this cost is slightly cheaper unless I have some one with me then the price doubles. I don't like this service as once my appointment is over I have to phone the driver and wait for him to collect me, depending where he is could be a long wait.  You could also phone your hospitals Pals office for information.  It has to be remembered that volunteer car drivers are usually retired and don't work every day, some only work mornings only or afternoons, (one of the drivers I use can only drive me during school hours as she has children at school and she needs to be at home when they get home) which can restrict the availability of the service, it is advisable to book early.  The rate I pay works out at between 1/3rd and 1/2 of what I would have pay a mini cab added to the fact that my drivers are waiting for me when I ready to come home with most of the drivers coming to the clinic with me and waiting in the reception area for me to come out. My local mini cab firm would charge me over £90 for the return journey, I have never been asked to pay £30 for the return journey.  I have to pay as I am not on benefits or meet the NHS criteria for free transport through the HTC scheme.  Volunteer drivers offer a different service to the NHS PTS which is usually a free service.  Enjoy the Easter Break  Ian Clarification",

You may find it of interest to have a look at  https://community.macmillan.org.uk/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/breast-cancer-forum/175783/february-2019-breast-cancer-chemo-chat Although unfortunately the above thread closes soon as we are approaching March and my friend Leolady56 will be starting a new one in this thread you can chat to others and ask questions and I'm sure you'll find some answers if you repost in the March thread but do have a look through the February one where you can still post questions. You might be interested in joining the Chemotherapy which is on going and again you can ask questions to the members. I am sure that Lindsay (Leolady56) will be along soon to fill in any of the blanks I've missed. Good luck with the chemo  Ian Bodach",
