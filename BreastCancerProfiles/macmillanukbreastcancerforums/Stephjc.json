      "Content": "Hi Hedgewig, I've had terrible trouble with taste and found ALL foods disgusting!  After the EC, taste returned a week after chemo.But it got worse after T treatments. I couldn't stomach anything savoury. Sweet foods were slightly less foul although still tasted bitter. Small pots of fruit jelly and creme caramels slide down easily, and even Complan helps as it has lots of nutrients in it. I know others have found juicing a great success!  I finished my chemo treatment just over a week ago, but as yet taste has not returned and my tongue tastes vile!   Hopefully things will improve with time!  Stephjc ",

      "Content": "Hi,  I finished chemo at the beginning of June and my toe nails and now finger nails are ridged, yellowing and bloodshot! The white part has become much deeeper, working its way to the bottom of the nails.Some ( thumb and index finger,big toe) are worse than the others.I was recommended almond oil to use on my hands and nails and since starting with it, have seen an improvement in both finger and toe nails. They seem much stronger and by keeping them short have managed to avoid catching them on anything! Many of the products recommended are not on prescription and are very expensive! The almond oil is a much cheaper product and seems to do its job just as well. Stephjc",

      "Content": "Hi, I've just looked in horror at the list of foods to avoid during chemo! I had an Indian takeaway last night, a jacket potato the night before and a Chinese the night before that! I'm finding taste a problem and can only enjoy strong flavours! If I give up the things on the list there will be nothing left for me to eat and I've already lost weight during my first three chemo sessions! I am trying to eat vegetables and fruit whenever possible but it's like eating sawdust or cardboard! Steph jc",

I can't eat chocolate either, which is a shame as we have a cupboard full of it left from Christmas and from presents from friends. I was given an enormous Easter egg just this week, can only say that once chemo has finished I'm going to get very fat!!!!!!!! Steph jc",

      "Content": "Hi, I  was a part time gardener when diagnosed with TNBC in December 2015. I had lumpectomy and lymph node clearance ( all clear ) followed by 6×EC, 6×T and 20 sessions of radiotherapy. My side effects were such that I was unable to do any gardening at all. Tiredness and aches and pains were partially to blame, but I was advised not to garden in case of infection from scratches or insect bites. Even though I've been clear since December 2016 ( last mammogram ) I still cannot garden for more than an hour at a time due to fatigue. Things are gradually improving but it takes time. Hopefully things may be better for you but do take care.  Sjc ",

      "Content": "Hi, I used the meeting with the consultant to ask questions about possible side effects of T and put my mind at ease. She also checked I had any prescriptions I needed and that I was coping ok.  I've just finished my treatment. ( Chemo EC+T, 20 sessions of radiotherapy) and am now feeling slightly lost.  I had a follow-up meeting with a consultant I'd never met before this week and have been told, they've done all they can and that I'm clear for now. Not the most reassuring statement. I will be seen again in six months, but need to look out for symptoms in case the cancer comes back!!! On a positive note re parking, I was given a permit for free parking all the time I was on chemo and radiotherapy - saved a fortune in parking fees! Hope your treatment goes well and that you have more consistency in who you see at each meeting! Stephjc",
