      "Content": "Hi Penny, I had 4FEC and 4 Docetaxal which finished on the 8th December, I still have to have Herceptin injections for a year. I have always worn black or dark blue nail varnish and kept my nails short, this past few weeks my nails are very sore and I have just removed the varnish and discovered what I can only describe as a red bruised line and the rest of the nails thick white, I was wondering if yours went like that before they fell off? Also when they fell off was they sore and did you cover the bare nails with anything?  Kind regards Bagpuss",

      "Content": "Hi there, I was lucky enough to receive a MacMillan Grant, I used it to buy new bras that I needed and it also went towards the cost of my wig and parking as I was going between three different hospitals at the time and only received free parking at one where I was having my chemo.  The lovely MacMillan lady at my hospital helped me complete the form and to be honest it was only through talking to her about my situation that I found out about the grant. There is no shame asking for help if you need it, after all if one day you find yourself in a better position you could always donate some money back.  Good luck with everything. Bagpuss ",
