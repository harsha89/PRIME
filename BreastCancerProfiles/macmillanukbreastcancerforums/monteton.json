    "Content": "Good morning I had radiorhereapy last June and had 12 sessions I have stage 3 lung cancer it left me feeling so ill coughing with mucus in abundance tried antibiotics Â then steroids then xray as no imprvement xray showed pnemonitus the radiotherapy has scsrred the little bit of good lung I had . Apparently this can take over a year to heal. Have got inhaler the red one and now take co codamol30/500 and mucadine which seems to be helping. Started another course of chemo on thursday much stronger than before so fingers crossed it will reduce the beastie and give me some more breathing space. Good luck x",
