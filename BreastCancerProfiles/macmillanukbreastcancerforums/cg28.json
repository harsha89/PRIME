      "Content": "Hi! I'm 42 and have been recently diagnosed with Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma on the right breast. I am booked for a right mastectomy and axillary dissection on 1 March. Although I'm a fairly positive person, I am still anxious about the operation. We have spoken to the Breast Care nurse about what would happen post op but it really helps to read about other peoples experiences here. We've been told I would need chemo, radiotherapy and tablets after. But for now, we're taking it one step at a time. I am very lucky to have a loving husband who is my anchor. I've taken time off work before the surgery so that I can spend more time with my family. Although I am physically able to work, my mind is just a rollercoaster of emotions.  Everyone at work have been brilliant and so understanding.   On March 8, one week after my operation, our daughter's school will have a Mother's Day service. I am hoping that I am fit and well to attend, otherwise, my husband would just have to fill in for me :) Sending positive energy your way..xx  carmen",

      "Content": "Thank you for all the kind words.  Gail and J, I am normally emotional whenever our daughter does anything in school that parents can watch.. Nativity play, harvest festival, even assembly! I will definitely bring tissues and I might need buckets and a mop, too :) Mishka, I like what you said about worrying. I'm staying positive about this and counting my blessings instead of worrying about what will happen if. KateG, I am looking forward to the end of this journey and surviving it! More positive energy your way xx carmen",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie! I know what you mean! I was just diagnosed early this month and will have a mastectomy of my right breast on Friday, 1 March.  Physically, I was alright but inside, it's just a rollercoaster of emotions. At first, I couldn't sleep as well, but after a few days, I was feeling better. It helps to talk to someone who's been through it and has survived it..the people on this site are brilliant! Talking with your Macmillan nurse really helps, you can ask her anything! Sending you positive vibes..xx carmen",

      "Content": "Hi Annie! My first time to post here but I've been reading some of the discussions. I've just been recently diagnosed with Grade 3 IDC on the right breast and booked for a Mx on 1 March. Although we have met the BC nurse and told us what to expect post op, it really helps to read someone who's gone through it already. Although I'm a glass half full type of person, I stil had some worries about what would happen post op. Your post really helped.  Hi Tracey! Good luck with the op today. Sending positive vibes your way!  C  ",
