      "Content": "Sorry for the moan.  So I finally got referred for suspected lymphodema in my arm. This is after the hosp I am being treated in didn\u2019t want to bother, check me out or refer me. They then referred me to the wrong local authority. When I eventually got to see a nurse at a new hospital in a new area she was fantastic. I couldn\u2019t praise her enough. Caring, kind, empathetic. Everything that has been missing from almost every step of treatment and care plan at original hosp.  I was so pleased I was being treated with respect and being listened to.  I have written a letter to my oncologist about the whole, sorry saga. He said \u2018it is regrettable that you feel you have not been listened to.\u2019 My lymphodema nurse has almost returned my faith in things.  Happy Sunday to you all xx",

Hope everyone is good today.  I spent another sleepless night in pain, sweating like I was in the Sahara.  The pharmacist has changed my Letrozole and my brand of Venlafaxine. The Letro change I get, as Actavis and and Accord have merged but why change the Venlaf when the brand I was on for months was working and at least making life manageable. I\u2019m sick of asking to talk to the pharmacist, I\u2019m sick of fighting for tablets that are the best for me. I\u2019m sick of feeling dread, having to look in my bag of medication and wondering what I\u2019m going to get this time. I\u2019m sick of going to the gp and begging for help.  Sorry for the moan.  I\u2019m off to see Ed Sheeran today. Hurrah for that.  Happy Saturday xx",

I\u2019ve just been told Actavis and Accord have merged so I can\u2019t get the brand was the the favoured one for me anymore. Gutted as I had an awful time on Accord anastrozole.  Go chat to your pharmacist and change your brand.  Good luck xx",

The BCN says take paracetamol the day before to prep.  I can\u2019t even give people hugs from that side of my body as it hurts too much.  Paracetamol isn\u2019t going to cut it. Even the stronger stuff.  I know I have to have it but am a bit scared and sad.  Hope you\u2019re all getting some sleep.  Jane xx",
