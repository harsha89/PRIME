      "Content": "Hi optimist9. The margin around the tumour was clear but I am still waiting for the histology results on the Sentinal nodes. I have an appointment with an oncologist on Tuesday so hopefully I will have a clearer sense of the future and can get on with life!! My consultant suggested that they will either do radiotherapy + hormone therapy (temoxifen) or (possibly) chemotherapy + radiotherapy. Does anyone know of any fertility risks/ other side affects associated with temoxifen?",

      "Content": "Hi All. Just joined this site. I am 29 and was diagnosed at the end of July with breast cancer and have had lumpectomy 2 weeks ago which fortunately removed all of the cancer. Just waiting to see my oncologist to discuss treatment. I have still got quite a bit of pain in my breast and under my arm where the surgeon removed the lymph nodes - just wondering how long it takes for this to recede? In addition, my breast is still blue from the dye used to isolate the lymph notes - does anyone know how long it will take for this to go away??",
