Good luck on your journey.",

I have downloaded an app to my phone which measures how many active minutes you walk each day as my Physio said \"walking is good for you but you should be out of breath for at least 10 minutes every day to gain benefit from it\". I really don't agree!  I think just walking, especially in beautiful places, is good for mind, body and soul.  However, I thought it couldn't hurt to walk a bit quicker for just 10 minutes a day, but I live in a village and when you stop to say hello and have a quick chat with all the dog walkers etc, it doesn't clock it as 10 minutes because you stopped!   I refuse to be a slave to technology and shall enjoy my walks and if I manage the 10 minutes well and good, if not, doesn't matter.  Do you agree? Wish I could get my photos on here...... Hugs Linda x",

Hope you get it sorted soon.  Big (((((((hugs))))))) Linda",

Of course you have changed.  We all have; it puts things into perspective and I know I can't be bothered with people who are upsetting me any more.  I have some great friends who have walked alongside me on this journey and they are the ones that I cherish.  Their kindness and generosity have kept me going (rather like all the lovely people on this thread!). The others I have not fallen out with, but instead of me always arranging things and keeping in touch, I have left it up to them to do so, and if that means we drift apart, then so be it. I was once told that \"friends are sent to you, sometimes for a reason and sometimes for a season\". Perhaps that is true. As to the mammogram.  I was given some good advice by the radiographer who I was to see, she said, take a strong painkiller 1/2 hour before your mammogram and it will make the world of difference, and it did!

      "Content": "Hi Gallus I am 18 months post op and just over a year post radiotherapy.  I am also on Anastrazole. I also joined Slimming World as my weight had ballooned from 11 stone 5 to 14 stone. I saw the Dietician at the hospital where I had radiotherapy who gave me a diet plan to follow of 2000 healthy calories a day and told me to follow it for a month.  This I did and put on half a stone!  She  said if I had been dieting on and off for a long time, my body was resistant to change! Not helpful I thought, but maybe she is right. Anyway I joined Slimming World 2 months ago and have lost 8 lbs, not great I thought, just 1 lb a week.  Spoke to someone online at Slimming World who said to cut my portion size a bit, because although it is healthy eating, you do not have to watch how much you eat of \"free foods\" so I am going to try this and will see how I go. I should say, that like you I also exercise. It IS depressing, I agree but I am determined to lose this weight which basically just sits there around my middle!  I think Anastrazole doesn't help either but as I am on it for another 3.5 years at least I guess I shall just have to try a bit harder. Be kind to yourself though.  We have been through a lot but we will get where we are supposed to be eventually. Have you seen the \"Walking back to Happiness\" thread?  Always gives me a lift, even if I am just reading it and not walking as much as I would like. <<<<<<Virtual hugs>>>>>> Linda x",

Writing down what you wan to say before you have an appointment is a good idea, otherwise you can get side tracked and forget what you wanted to say. Good luck with the Consultant. Linda",

Letrozole has a lot to answer for, even if you do get a brand that \"suits\" you; thinner hair, thinner skin and thinner bones....... Linda",

I don't know if it would work for you, but after 11 months of Letrozole I felt I couldn't stand it any longer.  I spoke to the surgeon and he suggested Anastrozole.  I thought the terrible stiffness, joint pains, hot flushes, cold flushes (lizard moments!) and sweats would be the same as on Letrozole, but 2 months on I am stiff in the mornings or if I sit for too long, but the pain in my joints has gone!  He suggested I had acupuncture for the hot flushes and sweats as I didn't wan to take any MORE drugs.  I have had 7 sessions and my sweats have gone completely, and my hot flushes are reduced to feeling warm but not turning red and shiny!  I have another 7 sessions to go but am told that they shouldn't come back...  I was sceptical at first but am a complete convert now.
