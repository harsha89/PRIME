      "Content": "Hi Just wondered if anyone knows when our hair grows back.  I have had 3 Fec and 2 Tax (one Tax to go)  and my hair seems to be growing back white and fluffy!!! Wonder if this is the start of the regrowth or whether Tax makes it fall out again.  Not sure what to do with it just leave it I guess and see what happens.  Someone told me to have it shaved off first regrowth as will stimulate growth! Any ideas???",

      "Content": "I have recently had a mascectomy for breast cancer and ct scan showed I have to have kidney removed (cancer) prior to chemotherapy for initial diagnosis.  I have read an article about a link between root canal treatment (dentistry) and disease.  But of course not substantiated by dentists. Wonder if anyone has any info on this? Jackie",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your diagnosis.  I was diagonsed in August after being told by GP Practice Nurse most likely mastitus.  I have since had a mascetomy and going to have to have chemo and radiotherapy.  I must say I feel more positive than post diagnosis. It did take a long time for the news to sink in (in shock) also tearful however once a treatment plan is given hopefully you may feel more prepared to deal with it.  take care",
