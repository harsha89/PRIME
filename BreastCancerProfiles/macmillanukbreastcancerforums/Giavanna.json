    "Content": "I think when cancer strikes someone so close to us it makes us realise that we are not immortal and certainly for me it is making me evaluate everything in my life to ensure that aside from the cancer it is as good as it can be. I had a friend whose mum had cancer and it made her reevaluate her entire life to the point where she realised she was with the wrong man, she was unhappy in her job so she changed all that and became a much stronger person. She said she realised life was too short to meander along. Her mum survived the cancer, she was one of the lucky ones.. I'm not saying that anything like that is wrong in your life, just that maybe your subconscious is processing everything through. Hope that makes sense ? On a positive note its good that they have found no more cancer, I hope the chemo agrees wth her better this time JO xx",
