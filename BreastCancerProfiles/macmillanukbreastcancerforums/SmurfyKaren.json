      "Content": "Hiya Lovely friends, Just an update on progress following my ct scan. The cancer is contained to one side affecting the boob and the Lymph nodes, It is not hormone affected. I am in on the 10th for Pre op and going in on the 18th for surgery, Lumpectomy and Auxillery node clearance. Once that has started to heal i will be starting 18weeks of Chemo, followed by Radiotherapy then a course of a drug called Herceptin. All this is still very confusing and i suppose i will have more questions for the consultant after surgery. Bit nervous,but i 'll get there.",
