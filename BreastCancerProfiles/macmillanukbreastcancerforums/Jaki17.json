      "Content": "I just did a search about this very thing. No answers but the same questions. Finished my 3 FEC and on to 3 T in May. Since first chemo I have felt pressure above the elbow and a soreness. Got worse after second chemo. Showed it to onco nurse and she said yes, it was troughing and showing damage but felt confident my veins could take the next 4 treatments. I also have a dark and denting inward vein at my elbow and it is quite sore now after the 3rd chemo. I'm now relying more on my 'bad' arm (lymph nodes removed and mastectomy). Reaching is limited and painful. Nurse suggested using ibuprofen gel on area but I haven't gotten any yet to try. She said it could take a year to sort itself but that it would heal eventually. At least the really caustic red E is finished for me. I'm seeing the physio in May as well so will ask her too. I took co-codamol this morning as my hips are twingy (right on time on day 10) and a bit painful today so maybe that will give me some relief for my arm as well. All the best! Jaki17",

      "Content": "Hey Cartwheels, I'm on second FEC day 9. Using cold cap but not wetting hair (I get sick from wet hair without the chemo so think I'd rather it be less effective than fall ill with a head cold). My hair started feeling sore the week before treatment 2 and has really been falling out since then. I still have some and am watching with interest to see what will happen next. I did think I should have bagged it all up in one place as that would truely be an impressive (if slightly disgusting?) sight. I guess I fully expect to lose it all and have plans for some nice henna tattooing at some point. So if I keep enough to just have it be thin that will be a bonus. The drawback with not doing a pixie cut is that I leave a trail of hair everywhere I go. My family is being very understanding but the cat is looking a bit askance at me as it is usually her job to shed hair everywhere. Best of luck everyone, lovely sunshine here in Kent, UK today. I'll enjoy and make the most of today (after my nap). Jaki17",
