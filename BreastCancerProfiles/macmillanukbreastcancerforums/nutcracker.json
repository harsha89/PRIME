    "Content": "Hello Lady Muck, welcome to the site.  Very best of luck for your mastectomy; if I can give any advice it is to buy yourself a lovely nighty or pjs with looseness in mind for the op.  You will be sore and lots of E45 cream is going to come in handy.  Also, you must no longer use deodorant on your affected armpit, make sure you start doing the exercises asap and it would be easier if you found someone on here on the same part of the road as you right now.  It was a shock to finally see my flat chest and I had images in my mind of my boob sitting somewhere on a petrie tray being tested and prodded - I wanted it back!  Anyway, that's a long time ago now and I'm still here, in fact waiting for DIEP recon. Your decision to have immediate recon. will be made when you find out if you are to have radiotherapy as the oncos. won't give you immediate recon., as their findings on the type/aggressiveness of your cancer will determine your treatment.  Try not to look at the big picture - take one day at a time and take the best care of yourself ever!  Us women usually put ourselves last but you must do what's best for you now.  Rest, eat well, avoid stress and see each day as a new step towards recovery.  I wish you the very best for yourself and hope you are able to find lots of comrades who are walking this journey on here at the moment.  Kindest regards, Ann (nutcracker)",
