      "Content": "Hi Everone, Tally - glad your result were good. well considering what you going through any way. Thanks Noj, Jet and co. for Herceptin answers feel better now.  I think mostly with the different treatments it's the fear of the unknown that drives me crazy. I find getting lots of peoples perspectives helps to some extent as doctors only tell you the clinical stuff, they can't know what it feels like as they haven't been through it. Thanks again Dibs x",

      "Content": "Hi Tally, I was diagnosed on the 28th Oct. Had a mastectomy three weeks later. They found a few cells in on of the lymph nodes removed and then removed the rest just to be sure, as i am quite young for this (28). I'm starting chemo in the next couple of weeks followed by a year on herceptin. I haven't been offered any scans at all but i think it is probably because the lump was so small in my case but was surrounded by an eight centimeter area of early cancer cell.  Ask them anything you want to know, we have Macmillan nurses at my unit and they are so good to talk to, they know so much and you can call for a chat whenever you have questions so you don't have to wait for your allotted appointments. I have found them so supportive. Try and stay positive, Good luck. Dibs  ",
