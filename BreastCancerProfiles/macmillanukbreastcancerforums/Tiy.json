Am currently thinking I want to try DIEP but not sure if I can due to abdominal surgery as a child and also due to hypertrophic scarring at that site (think purple plasticine worm on belly for months/years) and now scar is 1cm+ wide - they may not let me do it. Am going to call for appt with surgeon tomorrow - DIEP isn't done at my local hospital so not quite so simple.",

      "Content": "eliza44 Hi Eliza I answered on your other thread what I've read about MRIs, but here's what I had. You're meant to have a triple assessment at your first referral visit (physical exam, imaging, core biopsy) but before that visit I had a letter from my hospital stating they were short on radiologists so no imaging could be done at that visit.... so the knowledge of my situation emerged over a number of visits. Here's what I had: 1st visit: exam and niple biopsy 2nd visit: mammogram and ultrasound and reults of biopsy.  Mammogram was like my 6 year old coloured it in with lots and lots of lines going from niple radiating inwards.  Ultrasound showed nothing.  Biopsy results were Pagets.  The mammogram lines were calcifications so they decided I needed sterotactic biopsy of those areas - this is where they use a mammogram to identify the exact place they want to take the biospies from.  Was told I likely had 6cm DCIS and originally they said I'd have to have mastectomy because of the size of it, when he re-examined me he decided I could have local excision as I would have enough tissue leftover. 3rd visit - stereotactic core biopsy - but before they did this they had looked again at my previous mammogram and decided to do zoomed-in pictures of a particular area to help them with where to take the biospies from. 4th visit - biopsy results confirmed it was DCIS an not invasive cancer, but the additional mammograms increased the amount of DCIS to >8cm so conservative surgery was no longer an option, was told I had to have full mastectomy. I've also susequently  had a contract CT - but that was of my abdominal area as i'm trying to have DIEP flap reconstruction so they need to make sure that my blood vessels are working properly for that to work. So that's my story of how I got to where I am. What date is your surgery?  I'm on 18-Dec and fingers crossed should get out just a couple of days before Christmas because there's quite a recovery for mastectomy with DIEP. Amanda",

      "Content": "So I met with the plastic surgeon yesterday and sadly was told I can't go smaller with DIEP unless I delayed it and had a temporary implant first to let the skin shrink around it. The way it was explained to me was that after the mastectomy, the skin is like an empty balloon that needs filling, if it's only partially filled it will be floppy/saggy rather than plump and full. She spent a long time prodding and shaping my belly working out if I have enough fat. Eventually she decided I do have just about enough, but they'll have to take everything I have including both blood vessels which makes it more complicated for the surgeons and a longer operation. Since I want to minimise the number of operations, have decided to go ahead with the immediate DIEP even though it means not being significantly smaller as I had wanted. Have gone through pre-op assessment, need to have a CT to make sure my previous surgeries haven't compromised things and have a tentative date of 18 Dec, assuming the onco surgeon from my home hospital is available in the same date as the plastic surgeon at the other hospital. It's a little close to Christmas, but I just want to get it over and done with now really.",

      "Content": "I got the great news today that other than Paget's, everything else is DCIS, not invasive. They also increased the estimate of amount of DCIS from 5-6 cm to 8cm so lumpectomy is no longer an option, definitely a full mastectomy. The great news is that means I no longer need radiotherapy and I can have immediate reconstruction if I wish. I am undecided if I want reconstruction, but have started to wonder - I'm currently a G cup and it's tricky to find high impact sports bras to accommodate this. Is it even an option to have a small reconstruction to say a C cup and reduce the other side to match? And can that all be done in one op along with the mastectomy? Or is that all too much for the NHS and they'll want to just deal with the mastectomy side? Has anyone done similar?",

      "Content": "Hi Eliza I'm sorry you've had further bad news. I've had a few twists and turns in my journey and one thing I've learnt is to trust my gut instinct. Noone can tell you what to do in this situation, but if the surgeon would offer annual mammograms only they can't be too concerned. I know where I am they strongly discourage double mastectomy unless there's something already present in that side. But I do think listen to your gut and you'll then be content afterwards. I had my mastectomy with immediate DIEP on 18th.  I got histology yesults yesterday and on top of the Paget's which I knew about, I had 10cm DCIS (more than both previous mammogram estimations) and also microinvasive area of 1.5mm (not shown on mammograms or ultrasound). The microinvasive area is ER- and PR-, but they didn't do HER2 test (don't know if that's that they just  didn't or if they couldn't). So now I'm being referred to medical oncologist to decide if I need further treatment, while they ask again for HER2 status.  My gut was telling me to reject tamoxifen and now I know it would have been useless since it's ER-. As for the other side, while I'm healing and recovering well, I've now decided I've had enough of hospitals so won't be pursuing my wish to reduce the other side. It is what it is and I'm fine with that.",

      "Content": "Hello. Sad to say I'm joining you all in here.   I'm 43, received diagnosis of Paget's on Thursday following nipple symptoms that lasted all year.   Nipple biopsy was conclusive and I had a rather pretty mammogram with 6cm calcifications which they're assuming is DCIS but nothing showed on ultrasound. Luckily I'm fairly well endowed so I might not have to have full mastectomy. And I've always been jealous of people who can buy pretty strappy sports bras that don't come in big sizes so that's my silver lining for now.  Back in tomorrow for mammogram assisted biopsy to work out exactly what we're dealing with.  I'm dreading the anaesthetic as that hurt like buggery last time.  Moving house on Friday, nothing like a few concurrent stresses.",
