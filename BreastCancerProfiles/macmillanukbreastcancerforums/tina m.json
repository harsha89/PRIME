      "Content": "Hi I had breast cancer 2010, diagnosed in January had lumpectomy and chemo and radiotherapy and whilst I was having treatment I still went to work everyday so that I could focus on something other than cancer and I could keep things as normal as possible for husband and kids. Since January this year ( i finished my treatment in September 10) my anxiety levels about cancer returning have gone through the roof and at the moment I feel like I will never be able to move on and live my life again, this really is getting me down. I had counselling during June & July which helped for a while but now all my anxieties are back. I am usually a very positive person and I don't want to burden my family with my worries it helps knowing that others know what this feels like cos it can be a very lonely place sometimes when no one seems to understand how it changes everything.",

I got breast cancer two years ago at the age of 42 and that was hard enough to deal with, stay positive and have all the treatment they can give you. Sending you a hug across the ocean from England, take good care of yourself xxx Tina  ",

      "Content": "Hi Carol So sorry to hear you are struggling with the emotions of being diagnosed with cancer. I had a lumpectomy in January last year (2010) then chemo and radio therapy and i have been on tamoxifen ever since. I carried on working through my treatment to try to keep things as \"normal\" as possible and to keep my mind occupied and emotionally I was fine and getting on with things until January this year when it hit me like a tonne of bricks that I actually had had cancer and what the implications of that could have been and will now be for the rest of my life. You say you are depressed and can't stop crying, don't feel alone in this I too have been like this for months and I eventually decided I needed counselling as I  couldn't tell my family how I felt, no one knows how difficult this is unless they have been through it and I wanted to protect them too. The counselling has helped, it was CBT counselling and helps you to learn how to reassure yourself and put the \"bad\" thoughts to the back of your mind and lead a more normal life. If you can tell your family how you feel, explain to them how scary this all is  tell them how much you love them and you need their support cos this is going to be a bumpy road but you will get through, stay positive and grab life with both hands. Take care hon  Tina  ",
