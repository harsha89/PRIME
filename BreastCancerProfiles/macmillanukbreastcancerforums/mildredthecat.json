No chemo, thank goodness. tired out enough with everything. don't know how I would have coped with that. (not very well knowing me)",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I was diagnosed with grade 1 cancer in September, had a lumpectomy and I'm now almost finished my radiotherapy. i am also on tamoxifen.  I find myself constantly worrying about the cancer popping up somewhere else. I woke this morning with bad back pain. would this be the first place for it to go? I see my oncologist on Wednesday as this is the last radiotherapy day. do you think I should mention having a ct scan or do they offer this automatically at the end of radiotherapy. ?  I try to think of other things apart from cancer but it's hard when i'm stuck here all day. I can't work as I look after my disabled hubby. Thanks for reading anyway, it does help me to write things down.",

I keep getting pains in my legs and back and well, everywhere really. hate this stupid cancer. though it's not stupid is it? it's cruel and brutal and knows exactly what it's doing.  I really hope you get good results and don't need anymore surgery. I also keep waking up at 3am after having really vivid dreams for some reason. Best wishes Julie xxx",

      "Content": "Kacang Sounds very familiar but my breast swelling started when I was carrying a lot of fluid from chemo. Docs told me it would settle but it hasn't. 3 months later, I'm now told I had a seroma which has septated (ie developed a lot of fibrous tissue), meaning they can't drain it. Unfortunately I now have to have surgery to clean it all out. So the moral of the story is get on to it as soon as you can and don't take no for an answer.  What I really wanted to tell the lovely ladies is that I've found a couple of really helpful items online. Firstly a gentle compression garment that looks like a shirred sun top - not medical at all. Secondly a pad that goes underneath it with thin and thick bits to get the lymph moving. Both have helped, especially to keep my skin in good nick. Happy to share details if anyone's interested.  i'm interested please. I tried to message you but can't work out how. my breast still has a bit of lymphodema and is a bit dimply. I finished radiotherapy early this year and it hasnt gone yet. I know it wont ever be like it was before though",

      "Content": "Last night I was feeling sorry for myself and saying how unfair it was i had had breast cancer. I was crying and then my husband lost his patience with me and said 'At least you haven't got kidney failure like me!!!'  His transplant is failing after 12 years and he's got to go on dialysis in the very near future. he's suffered terribly over the years with one ailment after another. I think if I had to choose I'd rather have the bc. than what he's had to go through. I now feel terribly guilty banging on about unfairness as NOBODY deserves cancer not just me.",
