      "Content": "I currently have Chemo every 3 weeks and I've just finished my third session. I know everyone suffers to some extent afterwards, but I don't feel I can cope with the side effects any longer. I have an appointment with my Oncologist on 21st April and I'm seriously considering asking her if I can stop at the 3 sessions, or if she'll put me on weekly sessions, assuming, that because of the lesser dose, the side effects will be less. Has anyone else on here managed to changed the frequency of their treatment and did it help any? Thanks for reading and your comments welcomed, Jeanette X",

      "Content": "Hi D n' J, thanks for your quick response. The remaining three sessions are staying the same, DOC/carbo/Herceptin, does this help? (Then a further 7 months of Herceptin, which I understand is fairly side effect free). I had a single Mastecomy and 3 Lymph Node removal in Jan 15, which showed all clear. Jeanette X",

My Macmillan nurse told me where to go for a wig fitting, a shop in Leeds (HairPlus) and issued them with an order number to fit me out, we're going next Thursday. I don't fully understand yet what my cocktail of drugs is (on the schedule it says B Doc/Carbo/Her3) for 6 sessions every 3 weeks. On a positive note, I'm assuming that if I lose my hair, the hairs on my chin might go as well LOL Thanks again, Jeanette XX",

I have a few questions though: Is there any hair care I can do pre-chemo to minimise hair loss And, at what point can I reasonably expect the hair to start regrowing and how should I look after he new growth, i.e., which shampoo's, conditioners,brushes etc Thanks in advance, Jeanette XX",
