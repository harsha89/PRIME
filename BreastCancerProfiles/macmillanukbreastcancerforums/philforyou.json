    "Content": "I too have the same type of breast cancer and after what felt like ages to have surgery first a 25 cm tumour was removed via wide excision surgery where a lymph node biopsy was taken and two weeks later I discovered that one lymph node was affected.  Further surgery was arranged and the tumour regarded from 2 to 3 so chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy was suggested.  I have just had my second chemotherapy session and along the way I have had to fight for a bone scan and a CT scan due to experiencing other symptoms.  No results yet but like you I also felt another lump near the scar tissue on my breast.  The Consultant said it was scar tissue to it leaves me worried nonetheless.  I have been using bio oil to try to help reduce the lump and it does feel a little less prominent after a couple of months of using it.  Wishing you well.",
