It reminds them of their own mortality and they simply don't know how to respond. People want to know you're OK, they don't really want to know how you feel otherwise. Under normal circumstances I would be having chemo now but I'm not so people keep telling me how well I've done, how fantastic I look. All I want to say is I've had cancer not a bad dose of flu and I've now got to live the rest of my life in remission - we all have. Every ache and pain I get I start to wonder. I've also had the 'look of doom' from quite a few people for not being able to go through the whole chemo regime too. It's utter pants. Cancer has been a wake up call for me to live now. I don't know if I will be here this time next year but that's the same for anyone, not just people with life threatening illnesses. Yes, our odds have been reduced (marginally) but we're not statistics. We're people with lots to give.  Every day I try to be grateful to be here, right now. This stuff is scary. No-one will ever understand just how scary and that's the problem. Love & hugs to you and to all of us on here trying to make sense of it all xxx",

I had a good diet, exercised 5 times a week, drank water, etc, etc - still got cancer (as many others have said).  Having said that, I can't have chemo due to a co-morbidity and the cancer was in my lymph nodes so I've had to do something. I've gone organic, got rid of dairy, never really ate red meat, cut out alcohol apart from one glass per month, cut out skincare with parabens in & toxic cleaning products, plus all plastic water bottles. I also take a few supplements like selenium, CoQ10 and probiotics (and a few others). The biggie for me was Vitamin D. My levels were very low one month before my diagnosis and there is a lot of research that confirms low vitamin D is associated with breast cancer. I now take 4 x 1000 iU Vitamin D per day. Is it worth it? It's the only defence I have so for me I need to know that I have done everything I possibly can to prevent a recurrence. In the meantime, I live each day because that's all we have. It is a maze - I would say that whatever you do make sure it is right for you xxx",

They don't know what triggered such a spontaneous decline. I started showing symptoms with nosebleeds at 12 and eventually had to had a hysterectomy although I do have my ovaries - an added complication for hormone therapy :)  I was always told I was fine as it doesn't show up on a normal blood test until I eventually became so ill and jaundiced 11 years ago I paid to see a haematologist who diagnosed it. Yes, I am under haemophilia care as it falls under that  broad umbrella. With my stats, chemo shows a 6% benefit in the first 5 years, 12% in 10, that overall benefit has to be reduced by possible 50% or more to take account of this condition, so this is a big decision either way. Thank you so much for your support. Hugs Amy xxx",

I had to turn down every follow-up treatment after my mastectomy because of a rare blood disorder, although I'm at 'high risk' of a recurrence. In the meantime, the statistical benefit of chemo for me fell from 6% over 5 years to just 3% on the release of the 2nd predict tool and the survival rate went up from 77% to 86% on surgery alone. Their recommendations were made on the first tool, they would now have changed. In the meantime, I've just had a CT scan for an issue which turned out to be the blood disorder reacting to the trauma of the mastectomy. The CT scan was clear. It's 6 months since my surgery and my blood tests (platelets aside) are normal. I don't know what the future holds but I say a huge and very loud thank you for every single morning I wake up. It's now 188 days and counting. They're the numbers that matter to us xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Geordiebird Sorry to hear of your diagnosis. I am not having chemotherapy or radiotherapy despite being diagnosed Stage 3, due to a blood disorder. Tamoxifen has also caused fairly serious problems. So I have no option other than to do everything I can to look after myself. That means, for me organic food, a dairy free diet, supplements, non-toxic cleaning products, paraben free skincare and deodorants, little caffeine and alcohol, lots of exercise (I just realised how boring that sounds!) It is very early days, I had my surgery in June. I would much rather be in a position to have the chemo and radiotherapy as I feel incredibly exposed but as has already been said, surgery is the main treatment, the rest is to try and prevent a recurrence. I'm just thankful for every day I have now. I do have a positive experience to share though. My maternal aunt was diagnosed 25 years ago, had a mastectomy, took tamoxifen for 5 years and is now 74 with no recurrence. Good luck with your decision. . xx",

I forgot, I have another two good examples My next door neighbour is a lovely and feisty 83 year old who had breast cancer 15 years ago. She opted for a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy and refused chemotherapy, despite being strongly advised to have it. She had radiotherapy followed by tamoxifen for 5 years and is extremely fit and healthy today. And a good friend of mine from school was diagnosed when she was just 29. She had a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy only - she's now 20 years clear.  Hopefully that will be encouraging for the younger members on here. As you say, we need more of the positive stories. Here's the article about the Mediterranean diet, it was only 199 women but an encouraging story. www.theguardian.com/.../mediterranean-diet-stop-breast-cancer-coming-back-study-italy-fruit-vegetables-fish-olive-oil Amy xx",

      "Content": "Carolyn28 and Kitkat59 (I finally worked out how to tag people!!) Both your posts are so moving to read. Kitkat59 I was Stage 3 with lymph node involvement but ER+ (the highest I think at 8) and vascular invasion - I am not having chemo due to a blood disorder which as we speak is causing heavily bleeding gums and a gum abscess (and that's without chemo, I dread to think what would have happened with it). Ultimately it was my decision as the oncologist would have 'attempted to get me through 3 or 4 sessions if he was lucky' but the time I have now and the quality of life is more important. This decision has to be yours. I was fortunate in that all of my family begged me not to have any additional treatment other than surgery, especially my 21 year old son. I would probably be in my 3rd cycle now and feeling like you do. I went off on my own and spent a lot of time researching and reflecting but chemo never felt right and whatever the outcome, it was the right decision for me - all I can advise is make sure it is the right decision for you.  Carolyn28 Ignore the stats, no-one can make any predictions. They're indicators but not the final word. A couple of weeks ago there was the story of a woman written off in a coma after a car crash. Doctors were about to switch off her life support when she moved her toe. It's a real miracle story as she is back home learning to walk and talk with the 'wrong' side of her brain - again defying all medical knowledge and predictions that she would be permanently brain damaged. I cut the story out of the newspaper and pinned it on my wall to remind me that there's always hope. I am 50 tomorrow, I don't think my oncologist expects me to make 51. My aim is to go see him on my 60th, if he's not retired! In the meantime, all anyone has is today and more than most people we know the importance of not really living it. Sorry if any of that sounds patronising, it's not meant to, but I wanted to give you both (and everyone on here) the biggest hug when I read your posts last night. Much love xxxxxx  ",
