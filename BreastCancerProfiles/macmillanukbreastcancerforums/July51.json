      "Content": "Told I had breast cancer 5th December, biopsy results 18th, grade 3, IDC, Er Rich, waiting for HER2 (FISH), lumpectomy/nodal status tomorrow. I guess it feels like a road crash. Praying for small tumour and no nodal involvement. Good luck! Personally, hoping they will throw everything at me, and as quickly as possible given that it is Christmas and our local hospital in Wales is insanely busy. ",

      "Content": "MollyRiver, thank you so much for sharing your plan to ask the oncologist questions based on different scenarios. My oncologist appointment is 4th January and all I have been able to focus on for the last 12 days is what will I do if my nodes aren\u2019t clear!!!  I was told initially post mammogram and ultrasound that my lump was early and small, but at my pre op (for lumpectomy/ sentinel nodes) the nurse mentioned \u2018in passing\u2019 that it was IDC, Grade 3, E rich, Pr neg, HER2 positive (the latter has since changed to Her2 negative and the nurse said it was a pity because now I couldn\u2019t have Herceptin). I am finding that the hardest part is waiting for more results and having anyone to talk to discuss my options. Your idea has helped me focus and scenario building is far more constructive than striding about like a headless chicken. Did I say thank you?!!!",

Had my surgery 21st December and wondering if something in the way of treatment shouldn\u2019t be started soon. Good luck with your results. Fingers crossed they will be low (or intermediate even) and you won\u2019t need chemotherapy. Sue",

      "Content": "Sorry to reply to an old post, but I Googled \u2018did you know something was wrong before your breast cancer diagnosis?\u2019 and this is where my search ended up! Well, for a year before my BC diagnosis I\u2019d felt rubbish and had blood tests, seen a dietician, had a colonoscopy (found polyps), but nothing found to explain why I felt ancient, lethargic and no energy for life. The surgery nurse told me my nipple was leaning outwards, examined my breast, sent me for a mammogram. 5 weeks later had a WLE and sentinel node removal, found 3cm single receptor positive IDC (nodes clear). Am awaiting Onco Dx test results now before treatment decisions, but weirdly, I haven\u2019t felt this well in a long time. Like my old self. Realise of course that I\u2019m likely to feel a whole lot worse before I get better. But yes, I just knew something was wrong. ",

      "Content": "Mira, I also taught between university short term research/ lecturing contracts. I loved teaching and miss it so much. I understand how you must miss it.  Hitting 65 I would never have had the energy to travel to supply schools (taught out of county in none Welsh speaking schools). I gave up my short term research and lecturing in 2016 aged 65 as I was so lethargic. I also stopped working as an examiner due to brain fog. I also put on over a stone but ate next to nothing as I\u2019m gluten and dairy intolerant. I had all sorts of tests, and in December 2016 a consultant in Cyprus said I had something quite serious wrong with my bloods (collapsed in the street for no reason except I was exhausted doing nothing). My GP ran tests last theough 2017 but found nothing. I just didn\u2019t feel like me. In November 2017 our surgery nurse said my boobs didn\u2019t look right and sent me for a mammogram. The rest is history. Thank heavens the tumour was found. In spite of surgery just one month ago, I\u2019m packing ready to move home next week (mostly in-aided by my lovely but Neanderthal husband), but feel exactly like my old self. I find it all very strange.  I do hope you are doing well after your treatment and are able to enjoy the rest of your retirement. Susan. ",

      "Content": "Oh Mira, I just love Clearwater and the rest of the Gulf Coast. Hopefully I can go there in 2019 when I\u2019ve been a year clear. I\u2019m either starting chemo next week, or radiotherapy the week after. I\u2019m just waiting for my Onco Dx test results to come back from California (I did offer to accompany my sample)!!  Everyone says I must be mad moving, but I left a home I loved 18 months ago to come to this home which has had bad karma as I didn\u2019t want to leave my old home/ move to this one. My health problems began about the time I moved here. I think I mistook health problems for unhappiness. I\u2019m now feeling so much better after the surgery and look forward to a fresh start. I just hope I don\u2019t injure myself packing and carrying boxes (husband is Neanderthal and doesn\u2019t take his eyes off the TV except to eat and sleep)!  Nice meeting you.  Susan. ",
