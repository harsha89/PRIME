      "Content": "I totally feel you on this one xxx I think we respond with fine simply because we are women and we are expected to be fine all the time. We are expected to shoulder the problems of everyone else - both other women and men too. We are expected to be the emotionally strong people and so we believe we have to live up to that all the time. Here is the news - you don't. Think about all the times you have listened to the mundane and petty problems of other people for hours on end patiently empathising with them. This is now time for them to do the same for you - especially considering that this is not a petty problem. I think the other part of it is that people with cancer realise quite quickly that others dont really want the whole truth just in case they have to face the condition in the future. We recognise this after a while and start to clam up rather than watching people get uncomfortable. At least here you have people who can hear you and understand. It's alright to be afraid and to be sad x I hear you cos I am not fine either but I have begun to understand that admitting that sometimes can be better than trying to hide it.  Hugs  Liz ",

      "Content": "Hi there peeps  Just a quick one I was wondering if any one on here had considered being sterilised in order to avoid accidental pregnancy and reoccurrence.  I was 41 going into chemotherapy and still having periods and fertile (not having had children prior to chemo). My periods stopped whilst on Pacitaxil after having had FEC. Although I have had a couple of days bleeding over the last two days (8 weeks after chemo finished)- I am about to be put on tamoxifen or one of its similar cousin drugs all of which you are told not to get pregnant whilst taking. Plus pregnancy would very likely cause reoccurrence of the cancer because it was her+ oestrogen based and aggressive.  So pretty much come to terms with the fact that I will never have a child was told before chemo (just about). However due to the nature of the cancer loads of family planning methods are unavailable to me now because they contain hormones. I am basically left with condoms (which break) diaphragms (yep cos they never end up in the wrong place) and the copper Coil (which was so crap they replaced it with the miraina coil - yep you guessed it can't use that either).  Because they won't be able to definitively state that I am menopausal for another two years yet (regardless of blood tests) and because I have no intention of an accidental pregnancy causing secondary cancer (which it could do within a week or two of pregnancy with soaring oestrogen levels) I am seriously considering sterilisation or ovary removal. Has anyone here had this happen to them. I am feeling pretty alone at the moment. Having just dealt with diagnosis, surgery, chemo and radiotherapy I am now trying to decide this one. I know I should give myself some time to recover from the chemo and radio but to be honest if another operation is the way forward I would rather get it out of the way soon instead of the cancer rubbish messing up another chunk of my life and my time. Started chemo in February and only just finished radio today.  Does anyone know where I am coming from? Xx Feeling a bit sad tonight x",

      "Content": "Thanks Julia xxx Yep I am going to talk to my oncologist about it on Monday. I am expecting him to want me to wait for a while after finishing radio before I have it done. I can't handle having that kind of stress hanging over my sex life every time I have sex I might get pregnant which might give me secondary cancer - sod that for a game of cards. Sex is supposed to be fun and happy not stressful and grim. I don't have a partner either but having had cancer certainly isn't going to put me off trying to rebuild my sex life. I already have to get over my new boob I am not being reduced to panicking everytime I have sex that I might be pregnant which might cause cancer again. That's just a cruel joke. My intentions are to eat much better than before, drink more water, drink alcohol slightly less (I was never a big drinker really), exercise more (was already a rock climber) and never return to smoking (although it wasn't smoking that caused my cancer weirdly enough).  So with all those positive life affirming things I can't face my sexuality being messed up because of silly contraception nonsense it just seems ridiculous. I love a happy romp in the hay it's the best feeling on earth - something spoiling it to that degree I don't think I can take.  Its weird talking to some people who have never had to deal with cancer they act like my sexuality is almost unimportant now that I am effectively infertile and an ex cancer patient. Mind you these are people I shouldn't be listening to in the first place. \"You should feel lucky you are still alive rather than worrying about all that\"  The things people come out with never cease to amaze me!  Thanks for your kind reply xx",

If you are finding it hard to sleep try getting up again for a little while and reading something joyful or watching something nice and uplifting. Don't lie there driving yourself loopy because you can't sleep. I also took Kira valerian root tablets from boots for a little while which help but leave you a bit groggy in the morning (plus you would need to clear those with your oncologist even though they are herbal). Hope you find some happy sleep soon x ",

Try extra strong mints to settle your stomach.  Iced drinks are nice if you get a sore mouth. Bitter and salty things can taste good if you loose your appetite. Give yourself lots of time to rest your body will need to mend.  Have lots of nice funny things to watch or read to keep your mind on positivity. Find a local cancer support group they are fantastic and really help.  Hugs  You can do this xx",
