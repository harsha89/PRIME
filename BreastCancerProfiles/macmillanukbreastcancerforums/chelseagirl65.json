      "Content": "Thanks Ronstar yes my BCN did call back and assured when when I told her what happened it was probably nothing to worry about!  But if it persisted after a week to go to Drs!  Safe to say it hasn\u2019t quite gone but the pain has eased off a little!!! Guess I should just still take things easy for a while   Seriously though of all the places to pull a muscle why there? Lol!  ",

      "Content": "I'll try and keep this short.    Got diagnosed with breast Cancer last December, had a lumpectomy on the 20th and my 3 weeks of radiotherapy in late February... everything has gone to plan, what they said would happen did and I've not had an complications. Till today... over the last few weeks Ive had a stinking cold and a very bad chest infection so had plenty of coughing fits... but nowt out of the ordinary that comes with a cold.   Last night in the middle of the night I turned over and felt a bit of a stabbing pain (the ones you used to get after the op) and figured \"shit, feels like a pulled a muscle, have to still be careful turning over in bed etc) and now when I got to work every time I cough I feel a shearing pain  in my armpit.   Im just wondering did I sort of pull the muscle that is still probably healing itself!   Even if I slowly breathe in I can feel  something like a numbing pain (like someone pressing on, say a bruise sort of pain) Has anyone else ever had this.  I've tried to sort of massage the area but it doesn't seem to do any good. I've even contacted the Nurse Practioner at the Breast Unit of the Royal Marsden, but they just took a message and said my nurse will call back before the end of the day.    I just want reassurance that this can sometimes happen and to just be more careful and just bear the pain through gritted teeth Thanks!",
