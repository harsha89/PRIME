      "Content": "KateG Thank you so much for this post. I am halfway through my 6 courses of FEC then have rads and tamoxifen. Your post makes so much sense! I have read lots of stories about Taxoxifen and depression that I was seriously getting worried but you have made sense of it all and given me such comfort. Thank you Dawn xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Wondered if anyone can help me?I have just had my 5 out of 6 FEC chemos yesterday and near the end of this bit of treatment.. .thankfully! At the moment - I know this could change - I have been using the cold cap and fingers crossed seem to have kept most of my hair apart from the friar tuck bald patch at the top. Fingers crossed it only thins out more but I know I it could fall out yet hopefully not I would be devastated to get this far and that happens but I hope not.   Anyway, I am due to start rads end of May beginning of June for a month and wondered if anyone could answer the following - my last chemo is on the 24th April (health being well): Do you know when I can go back to the dentist? When can I colour my hair again and what is the best dye i.e. vegetable do you have a name? I have bought a hair/skin/nail supplement do you know if I can use this at all and if so when? When can I wash my hair like I used to - I have bought the FAST shampoo and conditioner? When can I shave again or use removal cream? when can I cut my nails? Sorry for all the questions and i know they are quite superficial but any help or advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read and I hope everyone is doing well and looking after themselves xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne I am about to have my 5th (out of 6) chemo next week. I have been using the cold cap. I have a friar tuck bald patch at the top of my head with a few strands of hair but so far I have kept the rest I also still have my eyebrows and eyelashes. I am not sure if they will all stay but so far so good. My hair was quite long and thick so I had it thinned out and cut short as I was told that would help. The cold cap was ok to start with but as my hair thinned it got slightly worse but I am persevering. If you need a wig go to Trendco in London and they have a website www.trendco.co.uk. They deal with cancer patients and the fake hair wigs are very good. The website also does good headscarves. Also Toni and Guy hairdressers - some of them - provide a service helping people withe cancer treatments they cut and wash it for you and provide you with advice from when you start to lose it, they cut your wigs for you, and they have a peppermint treatment which helps the blood rush to the head that is supposed to help your hair to grow. I have also bought some shampoo called FAST from Amazon which I will be using as soon as I can after the treatement to help it grow back quicker. I take the anti sickness tablets as soon as I feel a twinge of sickness. I am on FEC chemo. I have found it ok so far just felt tired, a bit dizzy and a nauceaus feeling. Take care and look after yourself. I have been told to drink lots of water to plump up your veins, apparently tonic water the night before is supposed to help. And pineapple is good to take the metallic taste away that you can get during chemo. I hope that is useful to you. Take care and wishing you the very best Dawn xxxxx        ",
