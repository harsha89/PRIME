    "Content": "Hi,  I'm new to this site.   I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July and have had a full mastectomy and reconstruction in October.  I'm due to start chemo tomorrow morning.  I'm going to have the cold cap too. I'm on FEC, 6 sessions every three weeks.   Any tips or experiences others might want to share?  A tad nervous and sore as had portcath inserted today as well.  ",
