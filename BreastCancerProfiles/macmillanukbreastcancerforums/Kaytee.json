      "Content": "I was just wondering how long the gap is between surgery and chemo? I had my mastectomy on 21st Jan and was told last week in would get my chemo start date at yesterdays appointmemt. However, the oncologist just went through the chemo side effects and explained about the chemo cycle but never actually told me when it would be starting. So i was just wondering what time frame everyone else had. Thanks :)",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone. I hate not having things planned out so not knowing whats going on sent my brain into overdrive. Im so stupid. Anyway, I called the BCN about an hour ago and she was lovely and made me feel better. She explained that someone would be in touch soon with dates so its just a case of waiting. No idea why i was told that i would get dates at yesterdays appointment. I started to worry incase i fell through the net or something (wouldn't be the first time haha). ",

      "Content": "...i really don't understand it fully and my head is so over the place i dont understand what they (and internet searching) is saying about it. Today i learnt my IDC was 4cms and i had an 11.5cms area of DCIS. 3 out of 11 lymph nodes positive for cancer. ER+ and also HER2+. Its the her2+ im having a hard time figuring out, does this mean it is harder to treat? I understand the ER+ is a good thing as it respondes to certain meds, but does the her2+ cancel that 'good' out? Thanks for any help.",
