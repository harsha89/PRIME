    "Content": "I\u2019m so glad I stumbled upon this thread today. I had my first FEC chemo yesterday and despite loads of anti nausea meds\u2019 I\u2019m struggling to drink. It\u2019s almost like my throat just closes up and I can\u2019t stomach the thought of it. I have a dehydration headache so am going to send my partner out for milkshake, ginger beer and lots of ice as your comments made me remember the super cold thing helped when I had hyperemesis in pregnancy.  Look after yourselves x ",
