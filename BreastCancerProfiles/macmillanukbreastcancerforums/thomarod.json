    "Content": "Hi I had my right Kidney removed last year in September due to Kidney cancer, This was done as radical nephrectomy via Keyhole surgery. Ever since the surgery i get a lot of back pain around the lower and upper back area of my left Kidney. These pains are also around the areas where the entry was made for the keyhole surgery etc. Does anyone else get these pains and how long does it last for.Â  Even though i will be 50 this year i have always been a strong fit person going to the gym for the last 20 years 3 times a week. I feel like a lot of strength has been zapped out of me, i also have become really grumpy around the wife and kids. Is this related to the affect of having cancer and the mental trauma it puts you thorough. I have my next CT scan on March the 29th so i am a bit anxious etc.",
