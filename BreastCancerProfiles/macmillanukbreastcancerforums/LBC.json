      "Content": "Hi Beverley, I started tamoxifen 20mg treatment 3 months ago. I am 48 and will be 49 in May 2014. So far so good for me (touch wood), I don't suffer from any of the common side effects indicated on the leaflet in the packaging. My period is still running like Swiss clock, 29 day cycle in the last 3 months just like before. The only thing that's changed since the start of the treatment was the lack of libido. But this is very minor in the scheme of things. I was told by my oncologist that 1/3 of the ladies on tamoxifen don't suffer from any of the common side effects. Try do some gentle exercise and see if the aches and pains go away. It worked for me. Now that I am back at work and generally keeping physically active, I don't suffer from any aches and pains anymore. As for feeling down, yeah I did suffer from depression when my treatment was coming to an end. I think that was probably due to physical and mental exhaustion living through cancer diagnosis and treatments earlier on. However now that 6 weeks after my treatment, back at work part time, keeping myself fairly busy, I still feel low at times which I cannot understand why. Sometimes I do have a good cry and feel much better after. Just like you, I don't look forward to Christmas at all! I wish we could just go away and hide! Can't be asked to put a happy face on Christmas day in front of the mother in law and all the relatives when all I want to do is being on our own! LBC xx",
