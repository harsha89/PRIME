    "Content": "Hi susie    try  to think positive  you and your body have been through a lot . ask on here phone someone at the breast clinic  . they will try to answer your questions.  don't be fobbed off and sit and worry. join a Facebook group if you can to ask people who have gone through it all.  I did it helps you can have a moan find out answers.  they have given you the same treatments  I had  . good luck and I hope you can get answers .  I have a yearly mammogram  but at my last visit to the surgical team they said we will see you in 12 months. the oncology    is about six monthly  at the moment , next one in april .
