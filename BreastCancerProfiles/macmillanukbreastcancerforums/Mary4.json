      "Content": "Someone posted on here re Staffordshire  uni Hospital and also a lady from Ireland...They had cool pads  same duration of time as coolcaps  strapped onto feet /hands during   treatment  This was for  Docetaxol. .  There is a small trial which you can prob google which showed decent results. depends whether your centre  would do this. I bought some gel insoles and stuck in freezer and popped into  my roomy slipper boots just before treatment and a couple of icepacks for placing hands on (covers in wee bag) Dont think they noticed or they didn't comment but like you I want to try my best prevent neuropathy .Failing that I came across this advice from a link posted here. Think this was for when you get home for first week(if treatment 3 weeks apart) place  palms of your hands .soles of your feet on ice pack  (or froze peas) for 15-20 mins   or slip frozen gel  insoles in to shoes.  Or Soak hand feet in cold water for 15-20 mins 3-4 times daily if poss  only follow these instructions week after treatment   Maybe  check posts as this was just from screen shot. Good luck! You've been through so much!!xx p.s. Just reread your post I have heard the weekly Taxol isn't as brutal(Im on 3 weekly dose) so may help you...If I were you I'd buy the gel insole for treatment..even take coolpacks  and use during treatment or for an hour when you get home? Excuse my explanation as just had chemo yesterday so bit fuzzy around the edges lol!!",

I understand  your scenario as Im on a randomised trial, but pulled the short srtaw so am getting chemo too. Other choice was radiotherapy and tablets, no chemo. I think no matter what you decide, you will get through this year a much stronger person  and you will have clear goals in life.You have done so well but the chemo knocks the stuffing out if you and suddenly you are ill!! Its crap!  I agree that feedback from oncology can be frustating but as someone here said ask for what you want, write it down so you dont forget as others can forget too easily and you want the best for you body. Good luck whatever you decide  Take care of yourselfxxx",

There seems to be conflicting ideas about fasting or feeding before chemo. I tried fasting beforehand and was so ill and miserable I didn't try again. Others report eating well beforehand . Certainly worked better for me but every body is different. Probably worth checking the threads.. The injections can be horrid too but  SE only last during the week you use them. Think flu like symptoms and bone pain.. But they are boosting your immunity. Be prepared with painkilkers and curl up  cosy, I used heat pads as well, look after your self,Hugsxxx",

ONLY saw oncologist 2 weeks ago. Short straw for Optima trial so first chemo yesterday. Wasnt so bad. Was told the Onco DX test not for me  for some reason. You may need radiotherapy to, but it doesnt sound so bad on the scale of things. I wish you all the best xx ",
