    "Content": "Hi there.  I went through surgery and radiotherapy last year and have been on Tamoxifen since March 2011.  I have hot flushes daily and they are particularly bad at night.  The emotional effects are awful and it does affect my quality of life.  I've tried Evening Primrose Oil but this hasn't really helped.  I think its important to dress in layers so that you can remove items of clothing (cardigans etc) as required. I seem to spend my days feeling hot and then cold.  Radiotherapy left me feeling very fatigued which a year later I still suffer from but not quite as bad.  Muscle weakness was also a factor making it hard sometimes to negotiate the stairs at home.",
