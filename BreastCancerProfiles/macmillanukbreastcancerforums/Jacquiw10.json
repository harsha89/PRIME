      "Content": "Cancer is just terrifying and your family has suffered a lot because of it.  The fear of cancer is always there. Waiting for results is the worst part.  This Forum and keeping busy while you wait is the only advice I can give you.  The fact you are screened regularly is a good thing as the earlier tumours are found the better. Treatments are improving all the time so even if it is bad news it can be treated.  Hope you get good news next week  Lots of hugs x",

      "Content": "Hi I went to my own hairdresser Alan Edwards in Wilson Street. I had to pay for it as a I wanted a real hair wig.  They got one that was the same as my own hair and cut it to suit me. Parruche Wigs in Virginia Street was recommended but I felt so self conscious that I decided to go somewhere I knew. They were amazing and really helped me to feel at ease. My hair just thinned and I didn\u2019t need the wig though my hair is now very short. Good luck!",
