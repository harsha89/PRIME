      "Content": "hi, thanks for the replies to my last post. sorry haven't replied sooner, have had a pretty rubbish time with the doxetaxel. Not as bad as the fec though . joint and muscle pain and very tired. Have had to give myself 5 injections to stimulate white cells which added to the pain, is it normal to still feel the effects of injections in sternum after finishing them last Friday, or could it be still the effects of doxetaxel. Anyone else experienced this. hope your all well",
