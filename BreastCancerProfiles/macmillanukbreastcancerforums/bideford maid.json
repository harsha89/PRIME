    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer 4 yrs ago this month. I had surgery (not mastectomy), chemo and radiotherapy. I have never had a ct scan. I get pain in my left side parallel with where the appendix is. Friends who have had BC have had scans. Why don't they do it for everyone? Wouldn't it give peace of mind?",
