      "Content": "Hi JMC04 Thanks for the advice. I am now on day 13 after my first FEC. I have not been too bad, felt sick and tired for the first 5 days. I went back to work full time on Monday and have felt fine. Round 2 is on 6th April and hoping it isn't cumulative and it's the same as the 1st round. Will let you know xx",
