      "Content": "Hi Mrs Shep I was feeling exactly the same as you this morning, met my oncologist this afternoon. Woke up early this morning feeling absolute dread. Started googling all sorts and working myself up, ended up in tears and feeling crappy after having a really positive last couple of days. Well now i have met him and he's gone through everything with me and is so positive and says my cancer is totally treatable i now feel sooooo much better and so positive. Yes i am still going to go through chemo, herceptin, lumpectomy (as long as mri comes back clear) radiotherapy and ten years of tamoxofen but i will be alive!!!!! Try not to stress out too much, stay positive, you will feel so much better after your appointment, i know i do now i know what i am dealing with, it somehow feels like a weight has lifted and i know that after a horribly dark tunnel there will be light at the end. Even though at times i am still feeling this really isn't happening to me and can this really be true??? I have to accept it is and do my best to get on with as best i can. I know you will feel better once you have all the info. Wishing you all the best for friday Love and hugs Andrea xxxx",

      "Content": "Hiya Sarah My situation is a bit different, my lump is her2 positive grade 2 and i am having, chemo (not started yet) herceptin, lumpectomy then rads. But like you have 2 kids, 13 and 9 and i am 39 years old. Since i found the lump all i could think about was dying and leaving my babies without a mum and how they are far too young to not have me around, that has devastated me more than anything. I am determined to kick this things butt for them! I know your stats are very good without the chemo, but if there was a 2% chance that there were some random escaped cancer cells floating around in my body i would have the chemo just to be sure and feel that i have done everything possible to get rid of it. I know my case is different and i dont have a choice but now i know my treatment plan i am happy and positive it will be a good outcome and i have done everything possible to rid me of cancer. Its your choice and your decision so you need to do what is best for you. Good luck with your decision Andrea xxx",

      "Content": "Morning Peeps! I was just wondering for those on chemo or radiotherapy does somebody take you or do you drive yourself? I am starting chemo on the 27th and my hubby said he will have my chemo days off work to take me but i was wondering with the radiotherapy because it will be every day will i be able to drive myself there and back? Obviously my hubby cant take me every day for however many weeks when he has to go to work, my dad can take me but i was just wondering if its possible to drive yourself? Thanks for any advice! Happy saturday! Xxxx",

      "Content": "Ahh thanks girlies, Exactly what i was thinking that i would be ok to drive myself for the rads, the hosp i'm going to is only 15-20 mins drive depending on traffic and its only £1 per day for cancer patients which is amazing! I started off at the local hosp which is rubbish but transfered to the other one cos its more of a cancer specialist hospital, the parking is so expensive at the nearer one, ive spent about £50 on parking in the last month its a joke and no concessions for cancer/regular patients! Have a lovely weekend Andrea xxxx",

I don't know much about it, my friend is in spain not back in the country til next week and this message from her has come via her cousin who is my best friend so i cant ask her about it yet and was wondering if anyone else has had it or what their thoughts are.

      "Content": "Hi Willow I am also 39, got my results 3 weeks ago back from biopsy, i have her2 positive lobular lump in left breast. My oncologist says i will be having chemo, lumpectomy, radiotherapy and tamoxifen for ten years. The last three weeks have been a whirlwind of hosp apppintments, ive had mammograms, mri's, ct scan and another ultrasound, more biopsies and more mammograms! I know how you feel. Its summer hols, weve had to put a holiday on hold although the oncologist said i would be able to go away for a week before treatment starts although i dont know when as i have to keep going for appointments, i do have two kids aged 13 and 9 who have been brilliant but we are trying to have loads of days out and do stuff incase we cant fit in a holiday which is helping me keep my mind off this rubbish situatuon! I too was planning my big 40th birthday bash for january which is now on hold for me too as i will be in the middle of my treatment. I am now planning on getting through this and hopefully having a bit of hair - am assuming all mine is gonna fall out and have already cut my mid back length hair to a pixie crop to get used to short hair which i actually really like - dont k ow if i will like the bald look so much though! Hopefully will be able to have a big joint 40th birthday with my hubby next august instead of jan but actually i was looking forward to being the star of the show and having my own party but oh well.... I have so many lovely friends and family who are texting, calling and visting almost every day but oh lord it is getting a bit much and i actually want a bit of peace and quiet! My mum is having the kids for a couple of days and ive said no to my best mate visiting tonight, i just want a night off with my hubby! I still cant quite believe this is happening to me.....its so weird, but i think as soon as i have my first chemo it will sink in then! I havent been to work since i got the bad news but i work for a massive company in a big shop with loads of people so its not a problem at all and i dont feel guilty one bit. Even if it was a different situation with work i still wouldnt care, this is my life, not theirs!! Anyway lovie you are not alone, message me anytime Sending love and hugs Andrea xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am new here, I joined last night/this morning, middle of the night haha when I was wide awake and couldn't go back to sleep as has been the norm for me since monday when I was told the results of my biopsy had come back and the lump in breast is cancerous. I'm still in a bit of shock and disbelief but I am getting used to it and have amazing husband, parents, brother, auntie and two best friends who have been here every day giving me support. Today is the first day I am home alone with the kids and actually am looking forward to it and just having a normal day with them. I have been told I have Her2 positive cancer and will be having chemo and herceptin first and then the lump removed after. I'm not meeting with the surgeon specialist doctor until next wednesday and having an mri next friday and then i think we go from there. I just dont know what to expect or what is going to happen, i dont know if i have to stay in the house or am i allowed to go away for a few days between treatments? We were meant to be booking a last minute holiday tomorrow for next week but all that has gone out the window now but i was wondering whether it will be ok to go away for a week here. My cat has three week old kittens, do they need to be out of the house before chemo starts? I have read its dangerous to have them and their poopsies around. My mother in law is having them i'm sure she wont mind taking the mummy cat as well but i need to know so i can ask her. I dont think i want the cold cap thing, i have read on here a few ladies that wore it and still some of their hair came out so i dont know if its worth the bother of it, somehow i'm not bothered about losing my haor but more bothered about eyelashes and eyebrows falling out!!! My daughter is almost 14 and is being amazing but my little boy who is 9 is just acting normal, i dont know if he really doesnt understand or whether he is blanking it out. I think maybe once i start to look and feel ill and especially when i have a bald head he will then realise. To be honest i am glad he doesnt seem too bothered i would rather that than him being really upset. Ive told my daughter to tell as many friends as she wants because she needs support from her friends but on the other hand i dont want them feeding her rubbish, one of her friends asked her yesterday if she had the gene and now she is really worried about it, i told her not to worry, she's far too young to worry about it. I was wondering if anyone knows of a forum that maybe she could chat to other kids who are going through the same thing but again i dont want her reading too much bad stuff that is going to upset her. At the moment because i havent seen the surgeon or anything yet, i feel like i am in a bit of limbo, i just want to see him, have the mri and get on with it. I keep getting asked if i have been told what stage i am in but they havent said. The peice of paper they gave me just says her2 positive score 3+ but does that mean stage 3? and no lymphovascular invasion seen but obvs the mri is gonna give more information on that. Theres loads of other goobledegook on there that i dont understand. I was in shock at the time they were telling me and so was my husband so maybe they said more stuff and we just didnt hear it. They did say though that it would all be treated and they have amazing results with chemo and herceptin so it all sounds positive and i am trying soooo hard to stay positive and not let negative thoughts in my head and worrying about what happened to this person and that person cos i know everyones situation and story is different. Sorry to ramble on and on but if anyone can answer any of my questions i would be really grateful! Thanks so much everyone Love Andrea",

I just dont know what to expect or what is going to happen, i dont know if i have to stay in the house or am i allowed to go away for a few days between treatments? We were meant to be booking a last minute holiday tomorrow for next week but all that has gone out the window now but i was wondering whether it will be ok to go away for a week here. My cat has three week old kittens, do they need to be out of the house before chemo starts? I have read its dangerous to have them and their poopsies around. My mother in law is having them i'm sure she wont mind taking the mummy cat as well but i need to know so i can ask her. I dont think i want the cold cap thing, i have read on here a few ladies that wore it and still some of their hair came out so i dont know if its worth the bother of it, somehow i'm not bothered about losing my haor but more bothered about eyelashes and eyebrows falling out!!! My daughter is almost 14 and is being amazing but my little boy who is 9 is just acting normal, i dont know if he really doesnt understand or whether he is blanking it out. I think maybe once i start to look and feel ill and especially when i have a bald head he will then realise. To be honest i am glad he doesnt seem too bothered i would rather that than him being really upset. Ive told my daughter to tell as many friends as she wants because she needs support from her friends but on the other hand i dont want them feeding her rubbish, one of her friends asked her yesterday if she had the gene and now she is really worried about it, i told her not to worry, she's far too young to worry about it. I was wondering if anyone knows of a forum that maybe she could chat to other kids who are going through the same thing but again i dont want her reading too much bad stuff that is going to upset her. At the moment because i havent seen the surgeon or anything yet, i feel like i am in a bit of limbo, i just want to see him, have the mri and get on with it. I keep getting asked if i have been told what stage i am in but they havent said. The peice of paper they gave me just says her2 positive score 3+ but does that mean stage 3? and no lymphovascular invasion seen but obvs the mri is gonna give more information on that. Theres loads of other goobledegook on there that i dont understand. I was in shock at the time they were telling me and so was my husband so maybe they said more stuff and we just didnt hear it. They did say though that it would all be treated and they have amazing results with chemo and herceptin so it all sounds positive and i am trying soooo hard to stay positive and not let negative thoughts in my head and worrying about what happened to this person and that person cos i know everyones situation and story is different. Sorry to ramble on and on but if anyone can answer any of my questions i would be really grateful! Thanks so much everyone Love Andrea",

      "Content": "Hey guys I posted a few days about acupuncture to help with the chemo effects but nobody had tried it or seemed to know much about it. I asked my oncologist and he was happy for me to have it and that i should start having the acupuncture before chemo starts to really feel the benefits. I dont have a date to start yet but it will be by the end of the month after some more tests and as long as the mri results come back clear he said i could fit in a weeks holiday before as well (woop woop) i am starting accupuncture this week so i will let you all know how i get on with symptoms once the chemo starts! Hugs and best wishes to all Andrea xxx",

      "Content": "Hi kimlinda, your not a wimp! You have been through so much and everyone is different! My journey is just starting i have had no treatment yet, was just diagnosed on monday but i know i will be having chemo and herceptin before the lumpectomy, i just assumed i would be off work until its all over so i was surprised to read on here that so many ladies have managed to work through their chemo. I spoke to my manager today and she said nobody is expecting me to work through this and my job is there when i am ready to go back. I work in a very busy shop in covent garden so many ladies on here have advised me not to go back to work because the risk of infectiin will be too high. Anyways the main thing is you have gone through so much and have come out the other side, how could you ever call yourself a wimp, your amazing and it doesnt matter what anyone else is doing, its you that matters! I hope i get through my treatment the way you have. Much love Andrea xxxxx",
