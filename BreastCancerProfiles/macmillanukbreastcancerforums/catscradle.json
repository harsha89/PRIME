      "Content": "Hi Lesleym44, Really sorry to hear about your friend, and you are right, we are so very lucky to have this brilliant, yet toxic, medecine which means we are still here. I've just finished my year of Herceptin, and found it really hard going, even though I had been told there are no real side effects. At  dose 7, I had a reaction , and it all went downhill from there.  By the time I was at the end of my treatment, I was spending 6-7 hours at the hospital because I had to have the doseage so slowly, even after pre-med.  I felt woolly headed and extremely tired, shivery and achey, and towards the end it was like the bad part of chemotherapy, but all the time.  I had returned to work, but the effects were such that I found it impossible to drive any distance, and as my job entails a lot of driving, it was not possible.  I wanted to persevere with the Herceptin becasue it improves your chances of recurrence a lot, and despite the bad effects, I'm really glad I did.  8 weeks on from my last dose, I am suddenly feeling like my old self - I've got lots of energy and feel as if my brain has started working again after a long hibernation.  My Oncologist said that I was at the expreme end of the continuum, and that most people don\\'t react like this.  However, there are a small number who do, and you may be one of them despite what the doctors say.Hope this rather gloomy account helps you.  I must say that someone else on the online community had the same experience, and although it is not pleasant, it did cheer me to feel that i was not the only person experiencing these symptoms.  Good luck!",
