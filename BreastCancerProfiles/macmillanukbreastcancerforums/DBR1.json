      "Content": "Hi G n'J  I think the treats idea is great, I have managed trips to the cinema and meals out with friends in between the metal mouth effect. The one difference i noticed with T is the electric like shock sensations I got in my back and legs when i went to sleep from day 4 to 8 post chemo.  Couldn't sleep kept me awake most the night.  That SE has gone now.  I was expecting flue like aching in my joints and muscles etc but this was nothing like I expected.  I haven't had a sore mouth or feet and my nails are holding on at the moment.  But as you say 4 down 2 to go, in a sadistic way I want the 31st to come round quickly now so I can say only one to go! Best Wishes Debbie",

      "Content": "Thanks for your encouragement, it does feel like a race to the finishing line and mentally viewing that finishing line approaching helps to see it as a journey with a fixed destination. Interestingly I have looked into the future and often thought i can not at this point ever see it  being the same again. There will always be a part of me looking over my shoulder to make sure the big C is not creeping up on me again.  I guess that is normal given what we go through. Today is a better day seems to improve on day 11 till chemo day so will enjoy that while it lasts  ",

      "Content": "Hi all I am a newbie who has just completed the T part of FEC and have x 2 more T to go.  So when I received my diagnosis in April after the initial shock to cope with what was to come I decided to try and not to think to much of the overall treatment ahead of me, reason being  I would find it to overwhelming and it would fry my head, so I aimed to focus on what I was going through by splitting it into stages and focus on working through what each stage brings.So to try and cope with this treatment I have split it mentally into 3 parts;  1. FEC-T    2. Surgery   3. Rads. Before  stage 1 of my treatment I did spend time online looking into what to expect and how to prepare myself; for chemo and side affects, diet etc,.  I am now over half way of part 1 and have x 2 chemo to go.  I am  now beginning to find that emotionally I feel more vulnerable and drained at the end of each cycle and it becomes harder to manage. No amount of preparation prepared me for the feelings of isolation and vulnerability i have felt even with a relatively supportive family. So my attempt to prepare didn't include preparing for the days that i would have an emotional melt down, feeling like a needy child who didn't get their share of sympathy love and hugs. Feelings of hopelessness like nothing will be the same again which would randomly turn to flickers of positive thoughts about the future after treatment ends.   So if there is anyone who is going through this stage of the journey right now i just want to say I think I may understand how you are feeling and If you have got through this stage with some tips of encouragement I would very much like to hear them.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Bluesy I am definitely experiencing the effect of getting my feelings out.  Its part of the psychological affect its having on me, I just say what I am feeling because it's like I want those to know around me to know what it feels like in my world and what I want.  This is definitely one of the more noticeable changes as i have always been the strong one who everyone relies on. My turn now to ask for help I guess, hopefully i will get to where you are and say that i feel stronger, fitter and better as a person. Best Wishes Debbie",
