      "Content": "Thanks Louise. I\u2019m hoping due to me being  Her2 negative chemo won\u2019t be necessary. My consultant mentioned tamoxifen as I am er positive. Maybe when I finally see the oncologist il be able to ask more in depth questions. I have already preserved eggs fertilised with my partner so that\u2019s always a back up plan. I suppose i should focus on the next steps my operation and then take it from there. Thanks for your support I will be keeping in touch xx ",

      "Content": "Hi loufill22 I\u2019m 26 and have been diagnosed with BC. I\u2019m also er+ and Her2 negative waiting for my op have to have a mastectomy hoping for clear margins and no chemo! Do you mind me asking what you have done about fertility? Do you already have children? I don\u2019t and the thought of not having any is something that\u2019s constantly on my mind. No family history of bc so I guess I really am unlucky! I too have polysistic ovaries (my periods very regular though) and was due to start clomid two weeks before we found the cancer. Have you been prescribed tamoxifen? ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone not sure if I am even in the correct thread my head is everywhere! I am 26 was Dx with breast cancer on in January have had a mastectomy all went well with recon. Clear margins er+ 8/8 and pr 6/8. No lymph node involvement and her 2 negative  my oncologist wants me to do chemo due to my age. I don\u2019t have kids yet and the thought of chemo ruining my chances really pushes me over the edge. I am due to start chemo in May Docetaxel x 3 every 21 days and then FEC for the same aMount of time. Do you reckon I should go for it would you in my position? What are the side affects? My partner is very supportive and will go with my decision. I just don\u2019t feel the side affects are worth it especially if my fertility is compromised. Oncotyoe came back at 41 giving me 30%. Chanceof recurramce although this drops to 15% with tamoxifen so is 15% really worth it? Please advise?  I have frozen 6 eggs fertilised but that\u2019s never a Garuntee  Lots of love to all going through this xxx",
