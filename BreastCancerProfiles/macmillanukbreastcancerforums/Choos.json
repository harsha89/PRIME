    "Content": "Hi, About 7 weeks ago I started getting an extremely itchy left breast, not the nipple but the breast skin/tissue itself. No rashes or anything. This increased until the point where I found it very hard to push out of my mind, but then my nipple started to darken and weep and it becomes scaly/scabby then sometimes some clear fluid. There's also a white spot on the end of the nipple. The nipple itself is strangely enough not actually itchy and I can only stop the itch by scratching the surrounding breast and the itch often feels deep. I finally plucked up the courage to see my GP last Thursday who examined me and said she feels it has strong indicators of Paget's disease (especially as I've never been pregnant so she feels it's unlikely to be a blocked duct and I've never had eczema anywhere and any creams/lotions I've tried show no improvement). She's put me on the 2 week urgent appointment list and the hospital called me the Friday morning less than 24 hours after I saw my GP and have given me an appointment next Wednesday at the breast clinic. I am only 25 years old and she has said it's very rare at my age but of course still possible. She's explained I will probably need a fine needle aspirate and a biopsy but for some reason she thinks they will rather do a biopsy under GA rather than local anaesthetic (something to do with my age and the density of scans being more difficult on breasts of younger people?). Anyway I'm just wondering if any this sounds familiar to anyone and if it does sound potentially like Paget's disease and if anyone's had to have a GA biopsy rather than a punch biopsy? Has anyone had a white spot on the end of their nipple without being pregnant and did just a blocked duct cause dry skin/weepy on the nipple and extreme itchiness of the breast? I'm sorry for the length of this and I know the best and only thing I can do is wait for my tests and results but just wanting some realistic advice/answers if possible? Thanks so much in advanceÂ ",
