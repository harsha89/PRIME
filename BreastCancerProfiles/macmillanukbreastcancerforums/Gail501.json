      "Content": "I'm going for my 7th rads session this afternoon and wonder if anyone can tell me if a smelly armpit can be a side effect of it. Dident happen till after the 4th session but now know matter how often I wash it the smell is back in a couple of minutes. I havent used deodorant on that armpit for a couple of months now because after the ops I had I couldent but never had any problems with a smell. The washing with simple soap and water was enough to keep me fresh. Its really depressing me now because I am sure everyone I come in contact with must smell it. Has anyone had this and if so was there anything they could do about it. Gail.xx",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for your replies. I mentioned it to my rads nurse on friday but she wasent very helpful, said was probably anxiety making me sweat more. But think must be same as you had Siani because its all the time its there. I shower once a day and wash under my arms another twice and always wear cotton tops. I will ask tomorrow when I'm there about seeing a nurse about it because its really getting me down. Gail.xxx",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed yesterday with breast cancer after having a biopsy when a lump was discovered at a routine mammogram and I am absolutely terrified. I have to go to back to hospital on thursday to see the breast cancer care team to talk about treatment. They dident say much else and I dont know what to expect at initial visit. Can anyone tell me do you get mote tests? More examinations? or is it just a discussion.  ",

      "Content": "Thanks everone. Will be going to see the surgeon later today and I am actually feeling a bit calmer something I would not have thought possible a few days ago. I am writing down all the questions I want to ask as the last time was all a bit of a blur and still dont remember much that was said. I remember she said it was about 2cm ans it looked localised. I dont know if 2cm is small/medium or big and can anyone tell me what she meant by localised. Kate I will be thinking of you on fri and hope it all goes well. Sending my love and good luck to any ladies or men who are going through this at the moment.xxx  ",

At least the ball is rolling now and you know a bit about whats happening. Try and get a good sleep [ I know thats easier said than done at the moment ] I' m still petrified at the thought of surgery on monday. I can still hardly believe this is happening. Its all moved very quick. Its all I can talk and think about. I'm using words that a few weeks ago I'd never heard before. Hope you can cuddle your boys soon. Take care.xxx",
