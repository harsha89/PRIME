      "Content": "Hi emily I am 37 and unlike yourself I never had lots of itching or dry skin. I noticed a change in my areola around my nipple but my sister whos a nurse told me to wait a few weeks before seeing gp as that was the only change then I felt the lump by and under my left nipple. Im also having a little discharge and aching pain which goes up under my armpit my nipple is also inverted. My gp as soon as he saw it told me told me were looking at cancer because I wouldnt believe after about 5 minute's he told me he was 99% sure it was cancee ,Im still hoping for a cyst have to think positive. Hope everything goes good for you would love to have a bath bit only have shower where we live so might pop over my parents house and borrow theres for a while. Add me as friend if you ever need to chat I understand how you must be feeling",
