I'm sure it'll all be fine, just booked in for a day case, but have to pack overnight stuff just in case.  I'm sure it's all in a day work for the surgeon:-)  Was everything okay for you? x",

      "Content": "Hi Lynne (and everyone), I was diagnosed last week and am booked in for 5th December for a lumpectomy and lymphnode biopsy.  I've found that all the Staff at my hospital (and doctors, had to ask for sleeping tablets), have been excellent, so very caring and helpful). I have had two previous lumpectomies (benign) about 30 years ago but am very nervous this time (maybe cos they've diagnosed the dreaded 'c' word). Hope everything goes well for you, and if I'm up to it I'll update after I've had mine? Could I ask anyone here, what was the radioactive injection like? That's the part that keeps sticking in my head! Ta!    ",

      "Content": "Hi Linda, thanks very much and I hope everything goes okay for you. After the initial shock (the lady who did the ultrasound said she didn't think it was anything!), i think I was quite chilled out, but then, and I don't mean this as a bad thing, the leaflets, and all the stuff you have given to read, makes it somehow seem more serious! (or is it just me???). Thanks again for your help, PS, sorry for the delay in replying, don't know what I'm doing and I sent my reply to the Group:-) x  ",
