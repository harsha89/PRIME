      "Content": "Hi Isingbass, no, not you at all - I can't stand the smell of perfumes/ aftershave / cigarette smoke etc - really makes me feel dreadfully nauseous . Strange thing is tho , this started about 6 weeks before I had the mammogram and referral and had no idea about the BC. Also, at the same time, our dog has always slept in the kitchen and has never ever attempted to come upstairs, but suddenly crept upstairs to lay on the floor at the side of my bed. Husband scuttled her downstairs and eventually, we had to close safety gate to kitchen door. All she did was jump it , to get back up !!! Might add that she now settled back downstairs. BCN said she had heard this many times and that ? can they smell cancer - quite fascinating really, dogs used to smell out drugs , so makes you wonder ?? Only thing, will scare me to death if she starts coming upstairs again !!",

Will sit and stay where ever we tell her to and not move, irrespective of time to telling her she can. Despite being 'told off' send downstairs and told to stay, she immediately crept very quietly back up to lay at the side of my bed. Her behaviour was just so weird and totally out of character . Re smells, I'd always loved my hubbys Prada aftershave and initially thought it may have gone off - went on hol prior to mammogram and spent £60 on a different one, only to react the same - he has to put it on at the front door just before he goes to golf and not to put any on if I'm in the car !! All quite interesting hearing other people's experiences X ",

The Oncologist was furious - \" do you know you can die with sepsis\" !!!!! On future chemo sessions , I tel straight away with any rise !!!  Do hope you start to feel better soon - it certainly batters your energy levels etc for a while - so plenty of rest !!!!

I had just finished chemo and had it on leg, going to inside of thigh. As I saw Dr within 24 -48 hrs of the blisters appearing I was able to have the antiviral tabs, plus was prescribed Gabapentin for the nerve pain .. Not sure it will show in your bloods or not , but do tell them when you go . Hoping all goes well. Love Mechele X X ",

Our dog is also very much part of the family and always had a GSD , although also love 'Labs' , such loving faithful friends. We had to have our last one put to sleep , aged 8 yrs, was totally heartbreaking. Always remember someone saying ' can't believe you being so upset just over a dog !!!! , some people just don't understand do they. Glad you got over your treatment, my last chemo yesterday, has been very hard, with 5 admissions, 3 episodes of neutropenic sepsis etc, so praying I have just one without an admission!!! Start rads on 1/6/16 - 21/6/16, my last rad in my 66 th b/d when we should have been on hol, but least of my worries. As mine on left breast and all lymph nodes removed, do worry about any effect on heart and lung tissue.  Anyway, thinking of you and sending love and hugs to hopefully help get you through such a difficult time, and believe me, I really can appreciate what you are feeling.

I will say, I haven't had any problem whatsoever - BUT, I do  the exercises given prior to discharge ( just had overnight stay as I was last on the afternoon theatre list !). Some Drs say to just do these exercises foe about 4 weeks, whereas others say do them Indefinately - they're only gentle exercises and don't take more than 5 mins, and it definately maintains good arm / shoulder movement and I have had no hint of any possible Lymphodema . I also had 15 sessions of radiotherapy. I hope this reassures you and sure all will go well on the 5th With best wishes, Mechele X X ",

      "Content": "Hi Sab , Interesting to read your post and totally understand your worries. I commenced Letrozole on my first day of radiotherapy last June - within a week , started with a cough , sometimes voice going quite hoarse after exercise. Ct scan , X-rays all show all ok , and I too feel it's more throat rather than lungs !!! . It's so worrying isn't it - initially I thought ' the radiotherapy to breast and chest wall have damaged my lungs' etc etc .and the cough is now diminishing to some degree . I have found a difference regarding s/e of Letrozole with regards to brands - most Drs will not prescribe Femara due to huge cost difference and found the Cipla brand was awfull. I'm now settled on Dr Reddy's brand with less evident side effects. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about - however you know your own body and if you do feel something is wrong , then persist with your BC nurse. Do hope it settles for you and able to feel less anxious . I'm sure we all initially feel quite paranoid after the stress of our BC journey. Sending big hugs , Mechele X X X ",

Cooked/baked things for freezing so had meals all ready for tired days. No sickness, or particularly bone pain. All hair departed on 8th day of first cycle . The biggest problem was with the neutrafils - ie neutropenic sepsis on day 7-9 . Didn't have contact with young grandchildren , avoided shopping precincts etc etc but every cycle had to be hospitalised for 4 days . It became a standing joke on each discharge - shall I book my bed now for such and such date !!! Had the injections on last 2 cycles to no avail. Time went so quick and it could have been worse. Everyone reacts differently and you may not have many side effects at all - the main thing is it is hopefully clearing any 'squatters' as I called them and all being evicted.

Was shopping in Debenhams with my daughter on the Saturday morning , scratched an itch on my head , only to find a full handful . My hairdresser very kindly did a grade 2 in the afternoon- we were both crying and pleased no one else in the salon. I was asked if I wanted to try the cold cap , however as it meant being in the unit for an extra 2-3 hours / being prone to headaches etc , decided not to bother. Still. a whole new meaning to 'wash and go' ha ha -- shower, dry head, wig on and GO !! No having to buy shampoo and conditioner, no leg waxing ( amongst other areas ha ha ) , pencil eyebrows, lashes seemed the last to go.  Hope all goes well - drink plenty , meaning WATER , check temp regularly ( before taking any paracetamol etc, as thes mask correct body temp ) . As my Neutrafils dropped significantly and therefore prone to picking up infections , I avoided areas like supermarkets, shopping precincts ( particularly touching escalators, public toilet door handles). I suppose s/e vary a little on which drugs you are having.  Wishing you love and best wishes for your treatment, it's surprising how quickly it goes by.  Mechele ",

I had surgery for IDC in November 15, followed by 6 cycles of Taxotere ( boy it was evil !!- was hospitalised on all 6    -4-5 nights ech time with sepsis / infections etc and thought I'd never get through it ), then radiotherapy.

It never fails to surprise me how people respond after the end of active treatment -- ' oh you fine now and it's in the past ' - if only it was that simple !! . On a lighter note , my 2 year old grandaughter took hold of one of my fingers the other day, looking quite disgruntled saying ' Mamar , you should not bite your nails , so sit on bottom of stairs for time out !!!!. In actual fact, yes my nails do look horrendous ,as are dropping off half way down due to the Tax and previously always had nice nails. Time out hasn't made them grow any quicker ha ah .
