      "Content": "Hello Smile x 2 I've bee reading about your reconstruction with interest. I'm having something similar -sort of - ... I had a mastectomy last month February, and had a Tissue expander inserted by a plastic surgeon, this will gradually be filled over several months with saline, I'm having my first fill on April 1st (pause for thought). Clearly I don't know what it will feel like but I will keep you posted. It may not be too comfortable - but thats life. I nearly went for the 'lattisimus dorsi '  muscle and fat taken from the back type of reconstruction. But, sadly I had a horrendous infection after the lumpectomy and none of the 'docs wanted to run the risk of that happening again.  Me neither - so we settled for the 'Expander' Like you, I'm having, at the right time, a new nipple, but before that, the expander will be removed when the breast size matches my other one and a Silicone implant will be insered, then the nipple attached later. All exciting stuff!!!!  and I already have the duckiest little cleavage! Right now, its still early days. However, one thing I have learned is that the skin must be kept really  soft with good elasticity in it. I'm a practising Aromatherapist so I've mixed some oils which instills elasticity into the skin and am taking care of that little problem.  Your post was 2009 so I don't know if your problem has been resolved - hope it has - but do let me know please.

      "Content": "Hello Noj, First of all you've probably had your radiotherapy by now, and you might / not be suffering from the effects - it affects people in different ways, hope yours wasn't too bad.  My sons mother-in-law really suffered but as no-one told me about her I was unable to offer help. No, I haven't had radiotherapy, I was very fortunate. I've had Big C twice, three times if you count being caught exactly before it became malignant.    I've lost a kidney and a breast, and it was this last time that really made me think - I  have to try and help. I'm a practising registered Aromatherapist ( member IFA ) and am presently having a website built. Until its ready I can't do much except say that if there are people who are really hurting, contact me if you wish to see if I can help you . Kindly, Squiffy",
