      "Content": "Hello lovely, strong warriors! It's been a long time since I've posted here but I've been reading all your posts and it's so sad that there are so many new members. I had MX last August/axial clearance/three FECs and six months of Letrozole and went completely round the bend! This means terrible mood swings (screaming and temper) followed by woeful weeping,inability to do anything constructive such as clean my teeth or go anywhere. With a huge effort I went to see my Egyptian Oncologist. He say \"Meeeesis Miles if I tell you that you go crazy and may neeeed to kieeel self you not take my tabets! You are now chemically depressed. I give you lots of nice antidepressants.\" Well, I thought-there's a thing! A warning would have been useful! It seems that this aromatase inhibitor causes depletion of Serotonin and dopamine in the brain-so happy pills to put them right back in there! Watch out for this girls as anxiety and panic attacks creep around and jump on you unannounced. It doesn't manifest itself in everyone thankfully. The best side effect of Citalopram (antidepressant)is that they have almost completely eradicated the disgusting flushes every half hour! Wooopey-do! Things got really good after about three weeks.Started riding again as osteoporosis scan clear, started writing a book, gardening and a new business in fused glass. Mad oncologist then phoned and said \"Meeesis Miles, I have bad news, you no ride horse again as meeex up with scan results\" Bloody marvellous - I have moderate to severe Osteoporosis! Whoever got my original results are going to be very pleased! I'm gutted about the horse and taking yet more pills so need to re-focus! The other thing (God I'm going on now) is that I seem to have a racoon coloured poodle on my head! I remember something similar on my grandmother's head after a perm.Talking of whom someone has also put her hands on the end of my arms! Also sporting a smart fluffy beard and trouble reaching to cut toenails as someone has put a balloon in my abdomen! Now it's not all doom and gloom! On the bright side I won a first with my Bichon Frise in a local dog show with \"dog most like it's owner\" (probably a hair and belly thing), I've learnt to do dry-stone walling and use lots of power tools-my favourite is the flamegun for weeds,I've successfuly grown seventeen types of tomatoes in green house and only burnt myself twice with the glass kiln! I try not to get too pastered incase I fall and break my hip but fail on the plastered and win on balance. I've trained my daughter to strim and mow, son to chainsaw and other daughter to cook and they're all really good at their new tasks. My ex-husband who rents a cottage from me I've trained to pay his rent on time and not much else. No-one wants to do house work so my friend in exchange for riding my lovely Topaz,fruit,veg and eggs cleans the house. Bliss. Can now concentrate on glass, garden and dogs! I just love to delegate!  I understand that I've rambled but all of you going through all this sewage - it does come out the other side into clear waters. French,Libby et al SANTIAGO!!! Hope you all make it with some degree of sanity - thoughts to you all Ansi xx  ",

      "Content": "Hey Judy God, what a nightmare! I consider my episode as a trip to the underworld with no coins to pay the ferryman to bring me home! However you do have a solution. This is to put Amitryptaline in mouth and swallow with a good slug of cider! Not only (in about two weeks) will this lift you mood to the equivilant of a meerkat on speed but will also alter your perception of pain pathways - a bit like a narcotic without the side effects! It matters not when you take the Letrozole as it's designed to take every bit of Oestrogen from self.(Technically ovaries are finished so Adrenals make Androgens that get converted to Oestrogens.Letrozole stop this happening hence second menapause!) I think also, although I can't remember exactly that it may reduce sweats and anxiety How did the assessment go? Did you get the red tape cut? I'm taking a trip to Devon on Sunday for a few days to see best friend. A month ago a four hour drive would have had me in a mega meltdown! Citalopram - now known as Jeffrey, will aide me in this adventure! Am going to see uncanny fourtune teller and pretty, clever hair dresser called Simon about colour of hair whilst I'm there. Hey lots  of lovexxx                                       ho",

      "Content": "Oh French -I'm so sorry about the tummy balloon-came as buy one get one free! Must have been re-directed to you by mistake! I've decided to call my Citalopram \"Jeffrey\" so named after my faithful, sadly deceased German Shepherd.This pleases me as I know that I have a reliable friend! Quite frankly I don't care a tinker's toss how long I've got to be on them as I don't want to spend another holiday in Hades! The other peculiar thing that I discovered this morning is back hair! How bizzare and gross is that? On the bright side I have none on my legs! Rock on Chateaux neuf in Santiago (wrong region though!) xxxx Ansi",
