    "Content": "I just had a 25mm lump removed with a mastectomy last week - it was a big lump - and the best way as I have small boobs was to remove the whole breast. I feel fine now - and have no problem with losing the boob - much better that than losing my life. I would be insisting they did something as soon as possible in your situation - I didnt have to wait because I have private medical insurance - but the NHS are notorious for keeping you waiting. The good news with mine was that it had not invaded the lymph glands despite the size of the grade 3 tumour - hopefully yours will be the same.",
