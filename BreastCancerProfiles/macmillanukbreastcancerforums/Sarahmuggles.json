      "Content": "Hi I finished radiotherapy in April (have had chemo, surgery and radiotherapy) am having Herceptin injections last one end of September (18 in total).  I have sporadic sharp  pains in my breast where the cancer was and my breast is swollen.  I saw my oncologist a couple of weeks ago and she said that it Is all the treatment I have had , also I do have lymphedema of the breast which can swell the breast.  I don't think the hot weather helps either!!  Sarah",

Just had an ice lolly and yes it does indeed work!!! So will keep up with those.  I hope your treatment is going well also will keep posted xx",

      "Content": "My next dose is on the 24th October.  Feeling much better today but did try and go to work yesterday which was a no no!  Lasted four hours but then had to come home and was exhausted so I have decided to take some time off of work to have my treatment and have recovery time and not worrying about going into work.  I have come out in a rash all across my chest and neck but went to the hospital and they said it happens and to take puriton which is helping.  It is not so bad today. I know what you  mean about the taste buds all I want to eat at the moment is soup followed by an ice lolly.  That is how I feel weak and off but after a rest or a lie down the weakness seems to go for you to be able to do something else. Hope everyone is doing okay - X",

Yesterday they started my meds before having docetaxol but even after that I had another bad reaction - rash, hot and breathing problems.  They stopped the docetaxol then and said that my ONC will review treatment.  has anyone had this as I am worried that I wont be having docetaxol again and after first cycle ONC was very very pleased with the outcome and reduction of tumour. Thanks in advance XXXX",
