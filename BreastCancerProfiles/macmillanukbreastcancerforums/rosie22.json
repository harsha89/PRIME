      "Content": "I had my op three weeks ago.  A lot of fluid still being drained off and most of my discomfort seems to be related to fluid build up as I feel much more 'mobile' afterwards but then it goes quite quickly again.  I find it really difficult to get into bed. I think my legs are too short to sit far enough back to get in properly. Last night was a milestone - there were a whole three inches between me and the edge of the bed!!!  ;-)",

      "Content": "I had drains in for over a fortnight - and leaked as well!  Then I started filling up inside instead. Then antibiotics (two kinds so far) I also feel that exercise reduces it - perhaps the lymph has to work harder and pumps it away. It's really uncomfortable under my arm tho so I'm glad to get it aspirated every couple of days.  My understanding is that if it hangs around then there is a greater chance of infection.  It's such lovely liquid, all healing, but the bacteria love it, too.  Aspiration doesn't hurt - just don't look at the syringe! ;-) ",

      "Content": "I've had cravings, too!  During chemo at one stage, I only wanted to eat Victoria sponges - but only the perfectly fluffy, real cream ones!!  And lattes.  After surgery, I now have a craving for cheese and onion toasties (on white bread) which I haven't eaten since I was a student, four decades ago!!!  And ice cream, too -  which again is something not usually on my radar.  No wonder I feel so bloated!!??! Tho last night I had a meal of quinoa and poached salmon and today I've had a couscous and mackerel salad so it's not all bad!! I agree that following what you crave probably is good for you - body is telling us something even if we don't know what it is!!   After all we can make ourselves eat something we think is good for us (like low-fat food) only to discover we've been pumping all sorts of bad stuff inside ourselves because the manufacturers take out the fat but substitute it with loads of cr** to make it taste good!!   Same with low-sugar drinks - they just add artificial sweeteners which is even worse than the sugar and makes you want to eat more!!  And there I was feeding myself with loads of salmon thinking this was Good - when it's actually full of all sorts of other cr** from the sea, and even farmed fish/organic has its own woes.  Even the words 'free range' don't always mean what we think they do!",

      "Content": "Mine is still building up 12 weeks later.  It's unusual if it keeps going a long time but not unheard of.  I get mine drained every week.  As they say, the pressure has got to go somewhere and yours has leaked through the wound.  I had leaking very early on through the tiny hole where they had removed a drain.   You might want to go to bed with a pad or towelling or muslin square tucked in to mop it up and save the mess.  But it's normal, the colour is normal, too.  Somebody suggested it looked like a pint of beer or tea and the pinkish bit is blood - well, we've got lots of that inside us! :-)  It's all very clean, and the fluid is something intended by our body to be healing so take heart. :-) ",

It's yours, all yours to keep. :-)  However, my toe nails are only now turning purple even tho I finished the Dozy some weeks ago.  You can just never tell!!!! ;-)  ",

      "Content": "Everyone is different - my breast care nurse gave me the best story ever of one person who was in the worst state ever when she arrived with them who recovered and others who may have had less problematic cancer who didn't.  It depends on our bodies, genetics and all the rest - and, quite frankly, our desire to live. BE HAPPY - have fun, do fun things, live well.  Laughter is your best friend. I believe - from my own experiences - that cancer is related to the crap life throws at us and how we feel about that crap.  Maybe that's just me but here's a plan : keep looking forward, create nice experiences to look forward to every week, make your family and friends take you out nice places.  Throw caution to the wind, expect enjoyable things in your life. They'll be happier if they know what to do and how to be with you then they won't keep their distance. I was told scary things about my (second time around) cancer and when they opened me up it wasn't half as bad as they'd believed.  You can still have tumours without them being living things - 'wait and see' is something they are researching now as cancer often 'comes and goes'. I have no idea what my prognosis is now - I should be ravaged by the disease but it appears I am not. I have no idea if they are sharing all they know with me or not.  Not quite ready for that step yet but at some stage soon I'll be demanding some different answers and information.  One step at a time. And research is bringing forward new treatments all the time. Second opinions are good things.  A different hospital, a different onc, a different environment - it might be better for you all round then you can choose somewhere different for future treatment. On the other hand, crap communication skills doesn't mean crap knowledge.  At least she was frank! You know you can rely on her to provide the unvarnished truth derived from whatever notes she has in front of her. ;-) Good luck!",
