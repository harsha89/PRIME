I'm sure it's a lot of hard work looking after 3 small kids normally, let alone after you're recovering from major surgery. I get exhausted just walking into town and then ache all over. You've got to remember, as someone advised me, it's only 6 weeks ago since your surgery! , give yourself time. X",

I haven't put av bra back on yet...but too soon but have an old maternity bra which has lots of extra room under arm area so am hoping that will help me as its very soft material. Maybe you could try one? Hope your recovery goes well xx",

My surgeon was confident I had enough muscle and tissue.(I'm a 36b \"ish\") that was on 25th Nov.She also said if I needed to uplift the other that could be done using lipofilling at a later date. Like you I to didn't need any further treatment. It's still a big decision to make so don't worry about asking them as many questions as you need to. X",

I had mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and no further treatment. It's sound awful but I do sometimes wish I'd never noticed it. Then I slap myself into reality after remembering it could be so so much worse. Jacky, regards your friends on Facebook...that's so similar to mine. I asked my best friend specifically NOT to broadcast on fb due to family overseas..needless to say I am minus a friend!!! X",

Very good advice about getting something in writing, especially as it turns out they forgot to give me some paperwork outlining ask my diagnosis and surgeries undergone??
