      "Content": "I also too had or have grade3 cancer.. removed tumour in may now having chemo my fifth soon ...I am too questioning carrying on.. I feel worse now... I guess we have to trust the doctors on what they say... Also if you didnt and it came back would you regret not having the treatment .. Part of me feels so awful with treatment i wonder if its a good thing , all these nasty toxins in your body .. To be truthful i am not sure of the answer, my friends and family all say keep going but thay are not the ones whom are doing it all.. Have had 3 fec treatments now having something called docetaxyl and its awful .. aches sore throat ,tight chest ..I need normality !!!!!!!!!!! So yes you are not the only one who questions it all.....melanie",
