    "Content": "Hi everyone I had DCIS and stage 1 in 2014 treated by lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node excision and 15 sessions of radiotherapy. Developers hard flat painfully area in same breast with nipple distortion. Was diagnosed yesterday with recurrence, same breast, biopsied and now have to wait a week for histology before seeing consultant next week. I'm Â shocked and upset but trying to cope.Secind guessing everything and questioning myself. Did I do something? Eat the wrong diet? I have never smoked and breast fed all 3 of my children. Just bad luck I guess but not the news wanted to hear. Guess it will mean mastectomy and possibly chemo. Has this happened to any of you? How are you coping? Any advice welcome xxx",
