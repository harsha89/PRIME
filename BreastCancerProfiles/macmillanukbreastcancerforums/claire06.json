    "Content": "Hi, I have been on Tamoxifen for almost five years and I have had periods during this time-not very often-maybe 2 or 3 times a year but when I spoke to my Oncologist she said it was perfectly normal.  If you are unsure or need a bit of reassurance then have a word with your oncologist or breast care nurse.  All the best Claire",
