I have made changes in my life and now do a mix of voluntary work and activities that give me pleasure and purpose.  Having cancer meant I met some wonderful staff, including my brilliant consultant, who has been my rock.

It must have been so stressful having this additional worry on top of your diagnosis. I'm glad you had the support of a caring nurse to get you through.  What a pain it must be finding out a food you previously loved now seems to be off limits. I think a lot of people find that chemo affects their sense of taste. I haven't any experience of it myself but noticed you hadn't had any replies yet to your question so didn't want you to think no one was listening.  I've had a quick look on the net,  and  while I haven't found anything that specifically mentions eggs, I  came across this information on our site here at Macmillan about changes in taste which might be of some use? Breast Cancer Care have an online forum and lots of information too that you may like to look at. Cancer Research UK also have some information on it. Hope some of this is of use. I'm sure you will get some replies from people who have gone through the same thing and can share their personal experiences.  Meanwhile, take care. Hugs Sue x",

      "Content": "Hello and welcome to the group.  Sorry that your diagnosis means that you have needed to join, but rest assured you are in the right place to receive lots of advice, support and information and that all important hug.  It is very early days for you and your head is bound to be all over the place so well done for being brave enough to find this safe space where you can talk openly with people who understand.  How much to say to children and teens and how to say it, is always a tricky one to tackle. I know there are some people here who have had to do just that, so hopefully they will reply soon and share their experiences with you.  While you are waiting, is it ok if I point you in the direction of the info Macmillan has on the subject? I have put a link here to the pages on talking to children and teens. Hope this is of some help. Take care. Hugs  Sue x",

There is lots of information on the Macmillan website too about coping with menopausal problems. I have put a link here to it. There is also the Ask a nurse section here where you can pose your question and one of the nurses will get back to you within two working days. Take care Best wishes Sue",

I find all these reports and statistics on cancer and reasons why people get it offensive and unnecessary.  All it does is give people fighting it another kick in the teeth by suggesting they could have done something to prevent it.  Perhaps if the media concentrated on making the signs and symptoms of cancer better known, especially the rarer ones, rather than distressing and annoying people it would be a better idea.

      "Content": "Hi Denise I understand and emphasise with your worries. Recovery from a cancer diagnosis and treatment can take time so you must be gentle to yourself. i think the majority of us in the groups have experienced similar feelings after treatment and found it difficult to get our lives back on track. Speaking personally, two years after treatment, I still have wobbles, and am discovering the \"new me\", because I do think attitudes and priorities can change after going through cancer. I agree The Cancer Survivors Handbook is an excellent read. Reading it makes you feel better that you are not the only one feeling that way. Have you read this article by Peter Harvey, which talks of the problems cancer survivors face? It makes for an interesting read and sums up how many of us feel I think. I don't know if you have heard of  The HOPE course.  I recently took part in it online and found it very helpful at addressing issues .It is possible to do it online if there isn't a group in your area. It covers topics like managing fatigue, stress, ways to relax, mindfulness etc and is a good way of connecting with people in a similar situation and sharing experiences and providing support to each other.. It may be that the group you are currently attending may offer the same things though, but I thought it was worth making you aware of it. Penny Brohn Cancer Care is a useful charity to look into too. The link to the website is here.The aim is to show people  how to live well with cancer and take back control of your health and wellbeing \u2013  before, during and after treatment. It offers courses and weekends for people who have had or are going through the cancer journey. I know a number of people have found it useful.  Wishing you all the best Hugs Sue",
