      "Content": "Im having my first EC tomorrow and also going to cold cap (determined to stick it out!) I am trying to remind myself that it\u2019s just drugs... I\u2019m told it\u2019s really doable and unfortunately most people who are fine don\u2019t blog (getting on with their lives)  So I\u2019m hoping that we can be a month of positive blogs! And that we all find it\u2019s better than we think!!  Side effects can be dealt with I just think it\u2019s the unknown.. it\u2019s awful!  When I think back to when I was first diagnosed that was horrid... the waiting!!! But now I look back and think wow.. that\u2019s done (Dx feb) and  feels a bit like a distant memory!  So I\u2019m hoping this will be the same!! Either way tomorrow will be done and for me 1/4 ofcth course done too.. so in a bizarre way looking forward to it!!  Let me know how you go!! Fingers crossed we will be fine!!!!!",
