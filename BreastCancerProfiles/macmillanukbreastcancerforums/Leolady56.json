As you have already seen lots of lovely people ready to share their stories. And all willing to be as supportive as they can be in this virtual place. I suppose if there was one simple easy answer none of us would be here in the first place. This site and other good well known cancer websites are the places where you will get some answers but not necessarily the definitive one. Because you are a special individual and will be treated that way. Please avoid that mad man Dr Google - as I was rightly told by another Community Champ when I first posted. Some of the info on there is not reliable, up to date or necessarily true. Keep posting and keep sharing to ease that weepy pain. The Awake thread are up all hours you will find solace and friendship there in the night hours. I am a 'goes to sleep, then wakes up early to think it all over' type of person. Take care and be gentle with your self. If you can't share with friends or/and family. Share here 'You are not your thoughts. Love yourself like you would a best friend' Take care Leolady",

No, you are not a 'wuss' you have just experienced a lot of surgery, poking and prodding, diagnoses plans etc etc. If it hurts it hurts and no matter what scale of pain they give. If it hurts you then they should be able to see. My veins are none too good either and I will have a PICC line. There has to be ways of making this work for you, with little or no pain. But then I feel it is the role of the professionals to be guiding you and finding the best way to deliver your medication. If you think it would help; in the Ask an Expert section of this site, you can pose your question to a nurse. Her reply may take 48hrs but then it will be a medically based answer. link No doubt other people will come along and may have better experience/ knowledge than me Until that happens, do keep posting and make yourself the priority in your life for the duration of your treatment and recovery Take care and be gentle with yourself Leolady56",

A core biopsy will give a clearer assessment and is one of the forms of evidence that is used to discount cancer or plan the next steps. With regards to the biopsy you get a local anaesthetic in the breast. Now some people sail through and others find it not too good. Really a needle in the boob not on the top of your what shall I do today list.  I chatted merrily away to the nurse throughout mine. It helped to be preoccupied. I think size of breast can make it more or less challenging If you need support and guidance everyone on this site has the skills and even the been there done it t-shirt Take each step as it comes - easy enough to say but not always easy to do. Share with someone close to you. And if possible take someone who knows you well along with you to the biopsy and the results appt. After both if at all possible go for a coffee or tea, cake or chat before returning to work or life  Hope your visit to this site is short and sweet. Take care and enjoy your weekend Leolady xx",

The lump will be your body surrounding the wound area in a fluid to protect it, a little like a lump forming after a bump on the shin say. My underarm lump was quite pronounced - well I thought so! The consultant allayed my fears telling me he had seen bigger. When I knew I had an issue was when the area became very red and inflamed, plus literally hot to the touch. Everyone on here told me off and sent me off to the doctors. For which I was very grateful. But as others have said - not least our very sensible Jammy - don't worry and post on here when worried or concerned. You are bound to get a sensible reply or a kick up the proverbial to get it fixed Hopefully you will now rest easy and enjoy the coming festivities. Take care Leolady xx",

One we didn\u2019t book a ticket for either.  People on this site have traveled many paths to get here . I hate to ask but what type of cancer have you got? Or are they still deciding? DCIS or  a cancerous tumour . Equally how big? Gosh what invasive questions and ones you may struggle to answer.  But if you can answer these, those who have been on the same path as you might just have some answers  But one of the very best things you have done is find this site. I had DCIS 2 years ago and did it all by myself. This year I now have full on cancer but it was a small tumour. If I had logged on to this site 2 years ago I might have got the information I needed and not be here this  evening  If you feel you have the info and can explain do The one thing I have learnt is that every NHS Trust has a different approach, procedures and support.

But that I thought that part was doable alone. Though ...... cumulative affect could be an issue with the tiredness of it all so getting to the unit  may mean you need help I think if there are no friends  around and if you become rather poorly then having hubby that first session is not a bad idea,  also he can see the poop it brings and needs really to see that. For most people the first 1/2 days seems fine then when the drugs ease off the rest kicks in.  I guess being prepared for the what ifs? Is a good idea. If you are poorly what should your daughter do, who to call quickly etc. Friends (and not the ones you expect) will rally round when push comes to shove and try not to refuse the help Hope you have seen there is a monthly chemo thread where you can share all emotions, thoughts and final celebrations when it concludes.

I am so pleased you have found this reputable site and have dodged the Dr Google less reputable and downright untrue ones.  It knocks you to the boundary and back, and you do start to look at all the little things; the what if I had; maybe too much x; maybe too little y; and why did I not see it coming. The reason being is cancer has not a discriminating bone in its' body. It picks on anyone . The biggest bully we will all ever meet. So ... stand up to the bleeping bast***. You define it and do not let it define you. This site is full of people who will support, guide and help you through the times ahead. They will not judge how you feel, which emotions you express or if you just want to hide under the duvet. But they will be here. Each step of the way you will find threads to help you conquer the next phase. I think what we all like to say is .... it is doable. Yes back when things were different, knowledge was different, treatment and procedures have moved forward. They continue to do so almost daily Until such time as others come along and post, do keep posting here or on other threads that may be of help Make you the priority in your life for now. Be a little (and some days a lot) selfish. The sooner you can mend the sooner you can start your new normal Gentle hugs and positive thoughts from someone still doing the treatment part. Leolady56",

Secondly...... nothing and repeat NOTHING around here is 'small bean', If it affects our emotional and mental well being then it is POOOOOOOP. And the triage chemo team are there to supply advice, guidance and support. They get bored if you don't call them. They are there for every little thing or big thing. CALL THEM. You also call a GP or 111 if your get a rash or a raised temp from the infection. Nip the little bleeper in the bud. NO exercises not a good plan.  I'm not a medic this is from all I have learnt from living the poop and supporting on here. And a big dose of common sense that new super power!!! I had a PICC line. Blooming Godsend. OK another procedure to got through and you may need to visit the hospital weekly for it to be flushed and cleaned, but in the big scheme of things that could be a plus. I am thinking a repeat of the last chemo is not on your cards. A lot of people also go for the porthcath earwig o tagging you for advice on this one. BUT ..... not all NHS trusts will supply them. For sure Oxford and Bucks do not. So........ get calling please. Get help please. And drop back in to share what next Gentle hugs  Leolady56 - a year on and all clear (it's doable hun)",

In fact some are even refusing to paint nails  and waxetc etc All this is to do with risk of infection and any comeback on the beauticians.

      "Content": "Mica There is a dedicated thread here for people going through chemo and at the start there are tips and advice I will put the link at the end. It is so challenging to know which side effects will hit each person and it is also about so many factors: the type of chemo, our age, what we have had surgery wise or not, as you said how we are generally now. My experience as with a weekly drug called Paclitaxol. I was hit hard the first week and the next 2 weekends were a wipe out. I did have the day after as high as a kite due to the steroids. But we are all so individual. You will even read of people who continued to work and look after the family. I decided that I would not use the cold cap  to save my hair- others have enjoyed success with that - but it was not for me. I went short, then shorter. Then by the 3rd one I took control and shaved it all off. I made the decision whilst I could. It was then scarves and wig. I have more hair now 2 months on. I did get my eyebrows semi-permanent make up and bought a serious kick ass red lippy to cheer me up. Try to avoid less reputable sites and Dr Google can be out dated I know others will come along with stories and advice. If you can look at the link and read but don't assume this will be what happens to mom. The site is a challenge at the moment as it is undergoing a big upgrade. LINK Mica in all of this don't forget to look after yourself, walk away if things get a little tough if only for a few minutes. Post here or in this group which is for CARERS . People will listen and reply. Cancer has a nasty way of invading all our lives and turning it upside down for a while. But so so many people survive and go on to lead new lives Gentle and positive hugs Leolady56",

If you had a broken leg then people would have a different attitude towards you The main thing I read from your post is the need for you to talk. Maybe parking it here is of help enabling you to express what you can't elsewhere. Sad to say not all nurses (and to be fair people) make a connection with us during any life experience. And sad to say your has not, I must say i only ever called my team for physical issues. BUT ........ 0808 808 00 00 helpline may have a voice you can link to or they will suggest other local places you can seek help near you. Did you have a Maggie's centre at the hospital? They have many activities and chat groups too. Dr Google is not a good source of info too many outdated posts, so do avoid it all and stick to reputable sites Please seek help and cry in front of your friends it has been a traumatic time for you. Tears are soap for the soul. Sending you a gentle hug and some positive thoughts. Remember how much you have already been through and pat yourself on the back for that.

A club we would love to keep the numbers low and not for selfish reasons either I and everyone on here would love to say don't worry it will all be ok, but as we are not medically trained and we can not see you we can't do that. What we all can say is many women come here and many women leave here never ever going through breast cancer, they find a lump and the answer is simple and the treatment too. And 100% we hope that is the case for you But you are now in the hands of the professionals and if needed things will move quite quickly - sometimes not quick enough especially when waiting for results - but much faster than in past and treatment is so so different now. Be assured that should it be you need support it will be here waiting for you in a non judgemental way How to cope with the waiting. Please avoid Dr Google and stick to reputable sites if you must seek answers. Try to fill your days with as much as you can, if you have a family this wont be difficult, and above all breathe. Try not to over think it all or possibly set aside an hour a day to think about it all ...... some people swear by this as an approach Until then we are here  Leolady56",

Weren't there days when a loved one, a family member or a work colleague peeeed you off or made you angry? I really do think so. But somehow the time we have with cancer heightens our awareness and feelings. When you had down days before how did you deal with them? Try that method again. I was mightily anxious the last few days as I had my 1 year check up to go to. I filled as much of my days as I could. I came on here and replied to many posts. All to stop my brain from working too hard at the thought of what would be said.  Above all Bobbie don't beat yourself up if you feel this way. Breathe and recognise that you do, accept it and find distractions for your body and emotions. And, as everyone else has said pop by here and share. Parking emotions here could be good Leolady56",

But pleased to say you have posted on one of the safest, most supportive sites  Just to say I have no medical knowledge but I do have BC - breast cancer I am going to deliver an opinion for your post Well done for the weight loss, gosh you must send us all the diet  Yup the tracker is done by a radiologist. It helps the surgeon to focus on the exact spot rather than dig around. Digging around not a good plan in soft tissue and your boob Results can take up to 2 weeks. I know you  are now thinking WTF. But there is a lot to do in the labs to grow and decide what is lurking in your boob. Each surgeon will have a plan they ask for, yours is going for the marker first in case he needs to operate Now ... no one on here can say what the outcome for you will be. We so wish we could. What we can all say is You have found a safe, caring and non judgemental place to be. You can post 24/7 and some one will reply I think not doing Dr Google is one of he best pieces of advice i can give. Because, it can be outdated, scarey and can be selling some sort of miracle cure So .... in between times. Well, try to fill your days, hug your loved ones, have some fun and post if you need more support on the thread you have created Take care.

If you are having radiotherapy this month, this is the place to ask questions, get support and chat to others going through it at the same time. If driving daily don't forget to ask if they offer free parking, most do :). And keep lathering the lotions on your site. The Radiotherapy tips  thread contains all sorts of tips posted by breast group members to help you get through radiotherapy. My tips having just completed RT: drink plenty of water; use plenty of cream (Aveeno was my favourite one); rest when your body tells you to; accept help and befriend the RT Team. You can use this link to refer back to the September Radiotherapy Club.\u2028 You can use this link for far more extensive information info about Breast Radiotherapy.

Numpty I was and surgeon genlty told me it was the glue. Well who knew. I coaxed it gently away but after I had my 2 week check up. The blue can take a good year to go and again don't scrub, breast tissue will be settling after the ops.

Now more to the point, it seems you got some good advice from others regarding all the diagnosis tools they use during the early days. I too had CT, Bone Scan, Biopsy and bloods. And automatically the brain goes into over drive. The better the picture they have, the more they know they can then plan the best approach to treatment. Do come back and say we will be waiting.

So on our last visit my hubby had put his phone to record. I suggest you may need to ask of the consultant if that's ok. But we found it really useful. We could rehear the numbers etc and we could ask at the time what we wanted instead of note taking I hope I said ....... Avoid DR Google. Yes I am sure if you sift and prod enough you will find good answers. But it is often plain scary, out of date and attempting to sell miracle cures. Stick to the tried and tested sites for good up to date information. And keep posting as everyone on here is a source of up to date knowledge as we are bleeping living it!! Right the days will scoot by if you are working and you fill them with simple happy making things. Suddenly it will be 3rd April and you will have a treatment plan. Positive hugs to you both.

This is where no matter what the time is - and I see you were awake at silly o'clock - you will find people to chat. The Gremlins -as I call them - have a nasty habit of keeping us all awake. There is a thread called Awake.... The whole waiting is a game none of us ever really get used to, but we learn to fill the days with as much as we can and posting on here. The whole cancer game does not come with a manual so when the smallest thing changes we quite rightly question it either rush to the GP or hope it will go away. NO inbetweens now. But I have always said go to the GP or call the BC Nurse. If it bugging you or keeping you awake then go. Because at this time our mental and emotional health need just as much care and attention. The whole BC is so different now. The diagnosis, The treatment. The meds to combat treatment or to keep it all at bay. It is a whole new world of survival of seeing families grow and being there. I have a grandson to hug and a daughter's wedding to plan. I AM NOT missing out on those. And you are not missing out on being with your little girl. Because ....... all the medics are going to do their very best to see you beat it and we will all be here to support and hug and cry with you and laugh with you. My surgeon told me 'I am in the business of saving lives and breasts'.  Right now then. It's time to have a joyous few days with that little girl of yours and all your loved ones. Stuff chocolate in and have a little bit of fun making great memories for you to look back on . Gentle hugs and keep posting  Leolady56",

Sadly knowing the answers for you and your mom are not going to be found other than with the medics/ professionals.  There are many things that spring to mind about what could be happening, but without medical knowledge it would be wrong to suggest. But let's hope that it is a simple answer and a simple fix. As having survived so much already you and your mom do not need this. You don't mention the GP, do keep them informed as they can help to move things along too. Well mine has certainly been a help pestering people. I would say if a doctor/surgeon/consultant is being dismissive and unresponsive you can always ask for a 2nd opinion. Again the GP being on board would help Others may come along soon and give even better advice Until then be gentle with yourselves and try to fill your days with simple pleasures Leolady56",

The biopsy showed the tumour in my breast was a grade 3 - naughty little critter cells unusual and a fast grower I named it Ian. That's a long story but being in education you have a lot of names you are not fond of Basically I needed 3 ops this last 9 weeks. And oh boy was I angry and went into meltdown when told about a 3rd op. But when I spoke to my consultant after I had almost demand a mastectomy, he told me clearly that he was in the business of conserving my breast and giving me the best most efficient route to good health. He was so cool. calm and collected with me.  The upshot is your consultant is going to do the very best he can too to give you the very best outcome he can with as little invasive surgery as he can.That may mean a mastectomy Then they will create a plan that will again move you towards good health. I read on one post how someone had thought 'Right I am taking a year's sabbatical to get well. Then I will have 20 or more years to live.' I think this way too now. Posting on here and reading other people with similar diagnosis is a good move. Maybe your hubby would benefit from doing the same or ringing the helpline. My hubby has gone into very helpful, pragmatic mode but I know he worries and I have seen the tears in his eyes when we go to appts. I started posting last Nov 2017 and now have lovely supportive caring friends all over the country. And I now have a new purpose as a Community Champion Sending positive thoughts and hugs to you both Keep posting and using the site, this is a non judgemental safe space Take care Leolady",

Others it is a long and difficult path back to full health. My time over Christmas was tortuous and I thought it would never ever end, but it did and some days I feel great. OK I didn't have all you  had but I did have 3 ops in a short while. So what I am saying is sit back, allow your body to end in its own time. Rest and sleep are good  Sorry Mac have not replied. When did you call them? Today? Days ago?  Have you called your BCN or the team of BCN;s? I am hardy surprised work is not on the cards and hopefully there are no outside pressures to go back. You must be your priority at the moment. Be a little bit selfish, do what your body wants and chat away on here. Share all those difficult emotions for people on here will understand more than you know. Please try your BCN Team or try Mac again.

A friend who is a nurse and has gone through this poop of BC, recommended me to take sea kelp tablets to encourage hair growth. I have done that and yes it is helping. Whether it would stop the hair loss of Letrozole I  am not sure. But for a small pot from a health food H&Barrett, I thought it was worth a try. And as my daughter who is a nurse always tells me  'That tablet might just give you expensive pee, mom'........... such a pragmatist my daughter Sorry I cannot be of any more help And once again great to read of success stories Leolady56",

      "Content": "concepta  This bleeping cancer so affects us all in different ways. My hubby comes to every appointment with me and chats to everyone. BUT will he talk to me about it. He is sat reading the news now and I bet if I started a conversation he too would go into 'ostrich mode'. Lots of mmm, yes and no. I feel they love us so much that facing what is an awful time for us is scaring them to bits. They must be worried that this will harm us more then they can control. I do think men like to pick up a hammer, a screwdriver or any tool so they can fix it. This is one thing they have no tools for at all. Now that's a worry for them. Plus it is all the emotional language that certain people do not have and have never needed to have. They are not practised in saying whatever is needed. My eldest daughter is the same , so please everyone reading this it is not necessarily a gender issue. Fear and worry of loved ones being ill strikes us all so differently. I do think if there is a male family member or good friend who you can talk to and who will then hold your hubby's hand that could help. NOW ...... I do think when your lovely hubby is faced with the reality of chemo and the side effects he will have no choice but to step up to the mark. If you are being ill from the side effects he can't ignore that.Maybe your lovely daughters need to say NO dad we can't help today you need to do it. He may need to go 'cold turkey' on helping you and he may not get it all correct or he may be forced to. By the way if my hubby asks me one more time if he should cancel the holiday we have booked in November I may just make the front of the newspapers and I don't photograph well. Tee hee No, lovely lady congratulations on 50yrs of married life and lots of hugs and positive thoughts for today I am not too sure if this has helped, but I am sure others will come along with other ideas. There are groups for him but it would strike me that pouring out his soul on here is not his thing Now you know ......... be gentle with yourself and look after you. God bless Leolady56",

There is the tick box if you don't want alerts Also if you click on someone's name it will take you to their profile You can request a friend and then private email someone who you may find of support or that you are in the same area I have 2 new buddies in my local are from doing this You never know.

      "Content": "LiziX   A warm but sad hello to this amazing site I found it back in 10/17 and since then I have found friendship, knowledge, understanding and unconditional loving support. It is truly somewhere that you can share your worries and no noe says 'don't be silly' or 'buck your ideas up'. We say 'kick its ass' and 'swear away' Hopefully in finding Mac site you have avoided the less useful and plain out of date Dr Google. I suppose if you had endless hours - yup 3 children that is gonna happen - you may find good advice If you haven't already done so tell your children's schools. They may well have a great system for supporting and nurturing them during this difficult time Truly I have found people want to help. I have friends of all ages and everyone wants to help in any small way they can. This does mean being open and honest with them but .......... The cynic in me says they are glad to dodge the bullet we took and equally they just want to help you battle it too. The main thing you must try to do is put yourself first most days. You will need lots of time to mend physically, emotionally and mentally. You need to be your best friend in the coming days If there is a significant other half they may need the support from here too. But we can signpost you or them there as and when It is doable. It is treatable. We can all survive. But we must listen when our bodies ask us to rest, eat and etc etc. hard with 3 littlies but get that support network and get it working for you. Right off to get my hair cut short as I too start chemo next week Gentle hugs and positive thoughts Leolady56",

I think your final paragraph is the one that speaks the most. A loss of a parent is a massive time for anyone. Even now 15 years later the smallest thing will bring my dad to mind and a song will have me in floods of tears. So, for you the whole situation is very very raw and now thrown into the mix the fact you are fighting BC and NHS poop/ rubbish systems. Well ...... Practically there are things you can do. Contact PALS and write down your frustrations at your treatment and they will deal with it. Maybe that will mean you can park that part of this. And I genuinely think you would benefit from some emotional support too. Maybe your GP is a good ear or can point you in the right direction; the 0808 number here is a source of support too; Maggie's Centres and Haven But keep posting here as you know people will come along with great support and suggestions Be gentle with yourself and make you a priority in your life for the coming days Gentle hugs Leolady56",

      "Content": "Kerra  There is no right or wrong way to do this. And pretty obviously your lovely mum has been coping with lots. I have 2 daughters. One is a nurse and copes really well sending me positive thoughts, daft pics and just fun things to my phone most days. I know she is saying I'm here for you mum. Even a little bracelet that has not left my arm since last October when the poop started. She has come with me to 2 appts. We love coffee and cake, and do that when we can. Even if it is a take away when days are difficult.. My other daughter (lives in France)sent me a small box of gifts; positive vibe cards, emergency choc (that didn't last long), a little book of happiness where I write about things that made me smile each day, a well known coffee shop card. But messages as well. Plus pics of my grandson and him always shouting 'nana hope your boob is better'.  You see it is the little things and the remembering the little things that matter. Goodnight text/message or a good morning one That's the plus side of mobile phones and social media Take care of yourself too and be gentle with yourself. Add something special into your day too.

You have achieved so much and may have developed so many different coping strategies you will be able to use and help others at work.

Going back to work this link will take you to MacMillan's page on returning to work and advice.

It was for me the fact I have a grandson that made me want to fight this BC bas****. And the fact my youngest had just got engaged. One important thing I am hoping is that the team around your mom are fully aware of all of this. And yes you may need to go behind her back to tell them. Emotional and mental health play just as big a role in getting well as does the physical treatment.  Like the lovely Ruby Rose I had hideous depression again work related. I lived in my PJ's and hardly left the house. Until my sister and youngest arrived to kick me up the proverbial. Not allowing me to wallow.Dragging me out and about. (Hubby was  working abroad). I think faced with the grand children and them primed to sit by her, hold her hand, telling her tales of the first weeks back at school. Tell them they are going to help Nana get better by doing this. They are her extra special medicine and all medicine needs to be taken in small doses, so we may not stay long. Children have massive resilience and just keep coming back for more. Just sometimes we have to be hard on our loved ones, tough love. I bet she used tough love on you before now. Read extracts from these and read survivor stories. There is a link if needed Take care lovely lady Leolady56",

And though he wasn't the best in that situation he did eventually listen. Maybe there is another GP in your practice who may have a better manner that would restore you confidence in the profession As to what is happening in your breasts. I am not too sure anyone on this site can give the definitive answer - which is not really the best of help to you when all you want is a clear cut answer so you can plan and get on with your life. I do know fibroadenoma  are benign cysts and are hormone related. I am not a medical professional but know this; has my sister had many of them over her years. They always seemed to appear when her hormone levels were high or playing up eg periods , peri-menopause and menopause At the moment you need to trust the professionals and the good thing is the GP has now referred you  back  to all the people you met and trusted before. Until that appointment do be gentle with yourself and remember no Dr G - not always a great source of recent and unbiased information.

I just used a well known search engine and came up with a whole list of where to get them from including Ama thingy site. I think what you or the GP needs to do is check with your pharmacy/ local chemist if they can source them for you. They may be reluctant. From what I have learnt either the |RT team hand them out or people buy them online Through my 20 zaps I used Aveeno and still do 7 months on.

      "Content": "Kathyx Hi and, as I am not too sure if you have been on the site before, then a warm but sad welcome I too have arthritis mainly in my finger joints. I take Letrozole. What I have been adding is : glucosamine sulphate; cod liver oil; Tai Chi and walking as much as I can. ( I am 62 BTW). There are many discussions regarding the joint pain from AI's and I know others will add their opinions and advice to mine. As I have been sat here for a while I will need to move as the joints stiffen up.When I wake each day, I wriggle and jiggle my fingers and toes, wrists and ankle so I don't stumble around for the first few minutes. Personally I have gone with 'I will take them , as my mind would be forever wondering'. Three years ago I turned down RT and here I am again, never sure whether I would have been or not. So don't need further angst Hope my short story helps in your decision making. Others will share too no doubt Take care Leolady56",

      "Content": "Hi Susie Firstly apologies as I can\u2019t tag you or put in links as on my iPhone . Laptop updating Grrr But...... There is a designated monthly chemo thread for every month where you will find further help and advice The truly annoying thing with the SE\u2019s are they will hit you in a different way to other people, so you may just sail through the whole thing; have a cumulative time of it or be hit like an express train from day 1. Not what you wanted to hear I know but honesty does help. Lots of people have issues with mouth sores and many swear by frozen lollies, ice cubes and frozen pineapple to overcome the issue. I found small amounts of food better than a meal then again I was on a different chemo than you.  Some people even use fasting at this time there was a thread discussing this recently too But one of the major thing that will be said to you by everyone is : Listen to what your body wants, needs and craves. Having cut back on carbs as my hubby is diabetic OMG I craved carbs during chemo. So I ate them. Ok I will now need to drop the weight but I felt good and my body felt good Hopefully others will post with more advice and good luck to you through this part of your treatment. Don\u2019t let it beat you and don\u2019t let it define you. Just make you the priority in your life for now Leolady56",

      "Content": "Hi See you\u2019ve skipped over to this site  Clear margins - from my knowledge - is all done in histology. Once the tumour has been taken they want to know that the area around it is clear. Now .... anywhere between 5mm and 10 mm clearance are expectations. My surgeon wanted 10mm hence 3 ops. Now each tumour may - repeat may - have its own histology. Just recently there was a post where tumours were very different. Treatment goes with the most challenging tumour. So .... radiotherapy and drugs could be the way forward  But and a big but. Don\u2019t over think it any more than you already have. Read posts when you have the answers and try really hard not to guess the unguessable. Looks like you\u2019ve been reading posts and projecting where you think this will end. Blimey we so like to be in control don\u2019t we?? So hoping the chemo has done its job and shrunk the tumours so the next stage is an easier time One day at a time Hugs Leolady56",

So good that was no shaving, as shaving mid RT NOT a good idea. Eyebrows came back quicker. Hair slowly dropping in to say hello. But eyelashes mmmmmmm stubbly. I did go semi-permanent eyebrows as they then gave me a frame to the face, but did that well before chemo So really think it is all so different. That's not what we want to hear ever but ...... One thing is for sure RT is so so different to chemo.  Take care Leolady56",

At least we have been there and done it, we are not sitting on some high horse. t least we wont say at least. NOW................... 1. Kill them with kindness. Yes you lovely people you are all so right. Lucky you haven't had it or at least I think you haven't got cancer ..... I mean who knows 2. Give them a full on meltdown. Embarrassing and they will no doubt go for the 'at least that will be the RT' and 'poor woman'. Or do they tut and give sideways sad looks, tippy head look. Had that one yet????? 3. Start your reply sentences with 'at least', see if they get the hint.' At least I have found a place where thousands of cancer people get it.' 4. Come on here and have a bleeping good rant. Feel free to drop some scorching words. Now 16-17 months on I get 'well you wouldn't know you've had cancer'. ME: 'No apart from when I was bald, the dent in my breast, trashed nails, and my hair growing back. Apart from all of the bleep I had, no YOU wouldn't'. They mean well and I think they are saying. You look amazing and sadly that is all they can manage as they are frightened too. Frightened about upsetting you and truly not knowing what the bleep to say.. Also they are so grateful that they dodged the bullet that is cancer. If this is truly getting to you emotionally and mentally then please do seek support from here, your GP, Maggie's Centres.

      "Content": "Sun and RT. As promised ladies This was the reply I was given when I Asked the Expert: Patients undergoing radiotherapy should avoid the sun completely as the skin will be extremely sensitive and will burn.  Patients should also avoid using sun cream on the treated area during treatment as there may be ingredients in the sun cream that can irritate the skin.   This skin sensitivity lasts after radiotherapy has finished, particularly for the first 6-12 months after treatment, but is really lifelong.  Patients who have had radiotherapy in the past should always be aware of the sensitivity of the skin and be careful.  We would recommend a high factor sun block at all times when out in the sun, and wearing clothes than don't have a big weave in the fabric as this can let the sun in.  The skin where radiotherapy has been given will always burn quicker than other areas of the body, but it is still a gradual thing, not instant so you get little warnings like a tingling to the skin which should tell you that you need to come in out of the sun or put some more sun cream on.   British skin foundation Care in the sun Leolady56",

      "Content": "Welcome to July everyone \u2013 for many you have a light at the end of the tunnel. If you are having radiotherapy this month, this is the place to ask questions, get support and chat to others going through it at the same time. If driving daily don't forget to ask if they offer free parking, most do :). And keep lathering the lotions on your site. The Radiotherapy tips  thread contains all sorts of tips posted by breast group members to help you get through radiotherapy. My tips having just completed RT: drink plenty of water; use plenty of cream (Aveeno was my favourite one); rest when your body tells you to; accept help and befriend the RT Team. You can use this link to refer back to the June Radiotherapy Club.\u2028 You can use this link for far more extensive information info about Breast Radiotherapy. While this page covers any possible Side Effects From Radiotherapy treatment - Both at BCC website. Keep going lovely people: It\u2019s one more step along the world you go.

Sadly, cancer is not fair and doesn't discriminate either. And no matter what the press may say it can hit who ever and whenever it likes. Yes we can all 'could do better eating and exercising', but when you have been here as long as I seem to have been you learn that is a load of poop. There are so many ladies here diagnosed, being treated, going through chemo and radiotherapy (RT) and surviving. Yes there is now a very high % of women here years after heir initial diagnosis. Treatment NOT a walk in the park for some, hell for some and others who can get on with life and work as if nothing has happened. And there is no way of knowing which one we will be. We do blubbering wreck around here. Well I certainly have. We do rant. We do rave. We do WTF. And we do laughs. Honestly because some things we get asked you have to giggle about. For instance...... I am 62 got asked to pee in a pot. And when I asked for why. I was told in case I was pregnant. I mean miracles take a bit longer!!! DOH. Crying in the shower is useful, you can blame it on soap/shower gel in your eyes. Now time to call in a lot of favours (that will sort out the good friends and the Sunday Best friends). They can't do treatment for you but they can drive you to places; pick up the kids; cook a lasagne for you or clean the loo!! That should sort them all out. I am hoping you have or will mention this to the children's schools. Often they have amazing support mechanisms. As and when decisions for treatment have been made pop back here and we will all give great advice and virtual hands of friendship. Plus point you to where you need to go for help. Now breathe. Remember what this will all be for. And make you the priority in your life and sod it be a little bit selfish Gentle hugs and positive thoughts Leolady56 ",

Of course you are going to be anxious, that is really how many people feel when they find strange changes to their bodies. And we all think bad thoughts too. Now I am going to suggest you do some very important things. 1. Get an appointment to see your doctor as soon as you can. Because they are the professionals. We cannot say even if we were medics. Don't be frightened they are there to help you 2. Leave Dr Google alone or any other website. They cannot see your body and are sometimes very old articles about all sorts of things 3. Tell someone who you trust and love.This is hard enough for older people to carry but for you so young you need a caring person with you. 4. You are very young and must remember your body is changing still. Think if there was something you did that might have hurt your body in this way. A sport, a dance move etc. Then you can tell your doctor 5. Now phone that doctor 6. And breath because this may not be where you need to be. But always be aware of your breasts and changes to them Are you phoning yet???? I hope so Your English is very good and I hope I have given the advice that will help you Gentle hugs across the miles Leolady56",

Your lymph system is important in that carries lymph fluids,nutrients and waste material between body tissues and the blood stream. Just being a devil's advocat here (and I have no medical knowledge) Is the removal of lymph nodes to stop further transfer of other less wanted cells around the body?? Maybe ask this question of your BCN. If I don't what then? Every day we walk out of our front door we play Russian Roulette. Every day of our lives we have been playing it. What we CANNOT do is  beat ourselves up when we make decisions and down the road we find it wasn't the best one. Here goes: My first handshake with BC was back in 2015. They found DCIS. They operated, cleared the breast and suggested RTherapy. I looked at the %. and the side effects and I said NO. So here I am 10 months down the road with DCIS and a 3mm tumour again (actually all gone as far as we know). But I made that decision in 2015 and I had to live with it and stop beating myself up. My onco tells me he could never ever say if RT then would have stopped this happening again. I feel sure others will come along and support you, share their stories and help you make the decision Until then gentle hugs Leolady56",

Normally when Champs post it helps and others jump in with information   My cancer journey is different than yours - indeed we are all the same but different  This has been a great step forward by posting on this site. The site is one where you will find great support guidance and some hugs and positive thoughts from others who have been in your shoes . It is a non judgmental site where you can rant, ra e, scream, shout and laugh yup we do that too  You may want to look at the Ask Expert link or even phone the helpline  I haven\u2019t got the perfect answer for you but the professionals will have an answer. Until then avoid dear Dr Google and keep to reputable sites. Dr G has a nasty habit of being outdated and frankly quite scarey  Until you get answers from the professional keep posting the support will arrive  Take care and be gentle with yourself  Leolady",

I have just popped in to say a warm but weird welcome to a site we didn't know existed and never wanted to find But you have found here. And what you have found is a site filled with great people living this poop known as cancer. It is filled with non judgemental advice and support. All your questions will find answers and remember no question is wrong or silly, so ask away. And whilst I am on right or silly that also means emotions. Whatever they are then that is it. You wont get a manual with cancer which is difficult so here will help. One good thing is that everyone is treated as an individual through treatment and though we share many side effects (SE's) they can be slightly different. In saying this I suggest you don't Dr Google as you may frighten yourself by reading out of date material,Here all info is fresh off the press as it is mostly from those living the poop. Until you have a clear plan of treatment keep posting and answers, support and advice will be here Make you the priority in your life for now (difficult if you have a family I know) but necessary to make good progress physically, mentally and emotionally. And if you can accept practical help from people Leolady56",

There is no manual but instead there are wonderful people who will supply great advice, support and guidance.

You might want to get one too - I have for all the appointments and what I want to ask but immediately forget as soon as a doc starts talking. Rabbit in the headlights. Whatever is ahead do one special thing for your self - Make you the priority for this time.

Thirdly: In the Search in Group you could type in the full name of the group and it will come up again a bit of scrolling may be needed. Finally: The email me replies at the end of each post could be ticked then an email will tell you when someone has posted - trouble is it can be delayed Well everyone else hope you enjoy a good walk today. I spent the morning with an oncologist woooo hooooo. Still no decision what next for me. So ok I will be walking more with you loverlies. Then it is hammering down outside so only managed a wee walk in the local town to post choccy hearts to my gorgeous girls, their partners and the famous Zippy who is the best garndson in the world.  Right weather had better cheery up or this site may need a name change.

The last one comes in useful particularly when asked to pee in a pot!!! I asked for why? To check if I was pregnant. I AM 61. Heaven's sake. This site is also filled with excellent professional advice and support, but the same comes from women living this *************. Fill it in. So today everyone else out there gawd you have been out and about a lot. Those who know I have had a bit of a battle with a ****** Onco. All resolved now. So .....that and a broken phone ..... means not too much galloping for me EXCEPT today Jac and I galloped for an hour, ate for an hour then galloped back. Obviously my galloping was the best.

I had forgotten it was a birthday so needed to post a card and add  a small pressie. I had it all in mind but thought the birthday was 8th. Hey ho! It got me out of the house and had a small gallop - mainly to miss the doggy doings!

We chatted then she announce \"Mrs P do you remember me as you taught me and my brother. \" Oh flip I did and they were a lovely family. Not been on this walk since probably this time last year and I was amazed at the changes. I drive it occasionally but walking opens your eyes to so much more. Now in recovery.

Plus there are online resources so I never need to miss learning a song. Words, harmony parts are there to download Tonight it will be: With or without you from U2. Been a real challenge as 6 part harmony in some places. Recap - Your the Voice. And finally 'Don't Leave me this way' another one in many part of harmony and lots of repeats. But I have been a model student and practised this afternoon. Can you see my halo. Or we sing that one as well. So ....... put it into a well known search engine and it will pop up. There is a well known social media page as well. Plus I have posted videos and I was in one. Possibly the Operation thread Jac. There are 3 in our area run by the same lovely lady -Katy. High Wycombe, Gerrards Cross and Beaconsfield Jac hope your daughter is feeling good after the op, hugs winging their way to her and you.

      "Content": "Well. Welcome to this thread. You may be surprised why it is here or happy it is here. Then again: \u2018You have got to be joking! Do you know what is wrong with me?\u2019 may be your response. This all began on the Extreme Fatigue thread. On there several people wanted and needed inspiration/incentive to get out and walk. Many people see the benefits of it in their life and to help on this; mad journey, train ride, rollercoaster ride and other positively rude words journey called Breast Cancer. It is not a thread created to make anyone feel less than they do at present. It is not a thread that will set people against one another. Being competitive with yourself or a simple challenge to yourself is the point, but not a race against others is a key premis. The idea is that you can do any of these or none: Post when you have walked. Post how many minutes you walked for. Post how you felt before, during or after. Or not at all. Post pictures from your walk, but ones that do not point to where you live. Post inspirational quotes, thoughts or comments. A simple like of people\u2019s efforts is fine. No need to write an essay unless you feel the need. On a safety note. Do tell friends, family or the thread when you leave and return safely. Be aware of your personal safety at all times.   Well here goes. Either it will grow and blossom, with lots of lovely people benefiting. Or I will have egg all over my face \u2013 not for the first time in my chequered life and career. Leolady \u2013 may be adding in the odd gallop to my walks. PS if you don't like us don't be cruel.",

Needed to drop my car off for new brakes - ouch that is going to hit the pension pot later. Then walked along in the cool of the morning for 30 mins then hubby scooped me up. Thank goodness the next part of the walk was a very steep hill in the Chilterns. Phew. I could have been picking blackberries there were so many on the bushes. I equate those to September October not July. This hot weather has a lot to answer for. And we will be needing to feed the birds more as the bushes will be empty of fruits!!! Mmmmmm Now sat recuperating Leolady56",

And if future SIL is a total wazzcock when he meets the feisty future ma in law ........ well he may duck and run Enjoy and savour the time Me too WhatHappened this bleeping pericarditis has left me struggling. Made worse by the fact we have cancelled our trip to S Africa for November as insurance companies wanted to hit massively hard (I mean stupid money £880 for me for one trip and one company £1000) or not even insure as more didm't. As today is just one week since diagnosis, then being practical I need to accept it. And yes we checked out all the sites on the thread on here. Feel gutted for Mr Leo But ........ today a trip to Rickmansworth for a whole day of Indian cookery from scratch. Bloated and amazed, best description.

I now try 1/2 days per week to ditch the meat and 1/2 have fish. Working on re - dropping the carbs. My short brush with chemo made me ravenous for carbs. White bread chip butties. OMG I craved them.

Hope those results put a good smile back on your face. But if you are in need of further help pop onto any thread and chat away. There are so many groups as well that even I struggle to keep up with it. I am one of the Champs - a volunteer who has had BC and the one year clear, other Champs are living with cancer and support other groups. Keep posting  I'm now checking out a local aqua aerobics class to add into my Tai Chi and walking. Yesterday I managed a swim........ first time since Oct 2017 !!!! That was when the poop started.

Yeah party central or PICC line or Hickman Spent a day at Maccy Towers brushing up skills, meeting new people and learning how to improve our roles and promote them. So lots of trudging between underground stations etc etc.  All you lovely Londoners hat off ...... as an ex-city girl (Brum) I DO NOT MISS city life. Off for a trip around Mr Profumo and Miss Markell haunts. Mmmmmmm Hopefully pics to follow, but as the site is never too happy with large pics and seems to boot out notifications due to them, I will probably have to make them quite small. Lesson learnt at Maccy Towers yesterday.  Leolady56 PS And afternoon tea because...........",

My hairdresser asks when I am next booked in.... then sagely says \"That will mean rain then!\" Last time it was snow! AnnJac  5yrs ago I climbed Snowdon with my youngest and the next day we went to Anglesea. It was sooooo lovely I felt like I had gone back to my childhood days. Simple, friendly and a gentle pace of life. Plus we found an amazing pub selling fab fish. I was pretty creaky after the climb and descent but still we achieved the climb Oh ladies who sing in proper choirs, I am so amazed at your knowledge. Me I just rock along to all sorts. We do have a local group of singers but I have found them all too snooty and up their own!!!!!!!!!!!! So I shall stick to Rock Choir Right think I will get blown to my Tai Chi class. Be gentle with yourselves One more step along the world I go Leolady56",

Hopefully you did not get sucked into the DrGoogle rubbish that can be found out there Sorry I\u2019m not able to offer a buddy hand but know that others will come along soon and say \u2018Here\u2019s a virtual hand of friendship.\u2019 That\u2019s what happened to me 11 months ago and it was much needed to know that there were others out there living the poop. They tugged me along the parallel universe with them. We added words to our medical vocabulary we never knew even existed in this world. We heard about meds, the best ways to ease side effects and how to kill those well meaning people around us with kindness.  And even now we say how the bleep did all that happen. Here is a safe place to scream, vent, giggle and holler. All emotions are the right ones. Did you see giggle in there. Yup ... at 62 being asked to pee in a pot in case I might be pregnant deserves a giggle. Hope the nurse who asked me has come now out of rehab!!! There are many threads here that can support you through this time. Many good professionals supplied by Mac too. No question too big or too small.  Until such time as others come by ... make you the priority in your life be a little and sometimes a lot selfish Leolady56 aka another Lindsay  ",

The other daughter lives in France hence the pics and grandson stuff. For me it is those simple things that help My youngest bought me a little bracelet it\u2019s not been off my arm in 8 months .

There it opens with advice and support, but it is also filled with women who are in the process which you may find very helpful Only 3 weeks ago and you are going back to work and adding in 20 sessions of RT.Plus the special and important visit to SA.. Right .......... as an ex head ......... get your GP to sign you off (unless there is an absolute need for you to go back). I always wanted my lovely team to be on tiptop especially for the end of term madness. RT is tiring and you cannot say it will take 1hr, 2hrs or 3 hrs out of your day. And you say you feel fatigue now. YOUR PRIORITY IS YOU.  Healing physically you may have. Healing emotionally and mentally, well would you be posting??? I am trying to be firm as I feel you need this at the moment. Hope you are not offended. Please take time, schools and work carry on with or without us. And if you feel pressurised by the school just ask for a referral to Occupational Health - they are usually amazing and make you their priority. But think tomorrow you phone the GP and school or email your manager today to say sorry but I am NOT really ready. Please post back on here or on RT thread I would like to know you have made a good decision Take care and be gentle with yourself Leolady56 PS spent 3 years in SA and back there for Nov.",

But it has been my saviour for so many reasons  I know you will get lots of positive posts from people who are kind caring and non judgemental. You will get lots of positive suggestions and help alongside of hugs  Now back to basics. Are you fully aware of the diagnosis . Grade it is 3. Adding more info can help . Your age. Post or pre menopausal. It\u2019s amazing how everything you are makes a difference. And it\u2019s amazing how things such as a great family, great friends, a positive attitude can also make a difference to where you will be in the years to come  Everyone is allowed to be in bits. But it is you living it all. So please put yourself first. I have a sneaking suspicion that\u2019s not you! Please be gentle with yourself  Please post when you can and when you feel emotionally and mentally strong enough to. Also close family members can do the same on here lots of threads to follow  For now take time to step back and breathe  Believe me you can do it . Just look at everyone on here doing it. Look at the different threads you may find answers there as well Take care you are now in the hands of the professionals.And as much as people like to NHS bash my goodness when the chips are down they come up trumps  LeoLady56",

I am definitely in pause mode. I keep using the phrase 'ducking and diving', but think your 'pause' possibly best suits the situation. Cringed at the thought of snapping sounds, hoping that is a good thing and you are feeling much better I too have taken the approach that the NHS professionals are doing their damnedest to keep me going. My consultant actually said he was in the business of saving my breast and my life. That was after a rather emotional 3rd op.  I am hoping to hear on 13th March - slightly auspicious date but........... Well as you know everyone on here is amazingly supportive giving great advice and caring comments.

You could call the helpline on 0808 808 00 00 where you will receive great advice and have someone who can explain where to look/ go for answers ( if they are answerable ) 2. In the Ask an Expert tab on here you can pose your questions to a nurse but be aware you may need to wait for a reply . Many of the Exoerts and all the Champs are volunteers.  3 Atrend meeting with the oncologist with your mom ( if she allows this) and ask questions of the professionals there There are threads on here regarding chemo and RT, but it can be a little overwhelming to read at the start.

Headaches being the worst side effect of all. But I am now heading for number 10. Aches and pains in hips and joints can be a big issue. Stiff hands and feet if she doesn't move enough. I take glucosamine sulphate with chronditon and Loratadine too. All of these you can get over the counter. Staying as mobile as you can for Herceptin is my best advice. Yoga, swimming, walking and Tai Chi (the latter my fav). I am 62 so no spring chicken Herceptin is a massive game changer for HER2 women. I heard this said many times.

And sadly we do tend to moan about things on here but that's part of the reason for Maccy. To share, to shed and to shout. Look realistically at actually how many women are posting to decry Letrozole. Is that it, is that all.  NO. Millions are out there popping the tablet and living life. Maccy can be a little like Trip advisor (gawd bet I lose my Champ badge for that comparison). You get 2 ends of the spectrum is what I mean. A fab hotel and a crap hotel and the same hotel.  Being a devil's advocate here...... you don't take it and BC returns. How will you feel?? I am now 7 months on Letrozole and ... yes it is not wonderful but the alternative does not sit well with me.  My perspective and feel free to tell me where to get off. And yes I am retired, so managing SE's I can stop the world for a day or two. But I refused RT back in 2015 after DCIS and I am back here!! I've tried hard to be reasonable about that decision but it does niggle. Nagging doubt. I don't like it. There will be other ideas I know but ..... sharing mine Hugs and onwards for the last 50%.

In 2015 after lots of advice and discussions I didn't go with RT but ..... would I change my mind. NO. That was the info I had then and I had 2 good years. Take control of the losing hair scenario. You decide to wear what you want, cold cap, scarves or wig or combination I first had a shorter cut than usual then shorter with the hair. When my hair started to fall I got very upset. Then one day I said 'SOD IT'. Clippers came out and I stood in the shower and it all went byeeeeeeeee. Hubby tidied it up sat in the garden making daft remarks like 'Doing anything special this evening, madam?' Daft bugger If you put cold cap into the search bar you'll get a whole list of threads and discussions about it. It wasn't for me. I don't do extremes of heat and I'd be well P******* off if it didn't work. Sadly there will be a constant footfall on this site. So always someone here to say 'me too'.

But you are now in the hands of the professionals and if they are in anyway concerned or worried they will move quickly. It might not seem it to you but they will. Finding a lump could mean many things but we naturally jump to the conclusion that it is the worst possible scenario - cancer. Yet some people post on here only to find it isn't. I am pleased you found this site to post one and hope you avoid sites that are not reliable and do not focus on cancer or are just plain scary as well as out of date. There is a lot of very good info on this site about what to expect when you go for your appointment. Also there are many people who who reply to you post offering good advice and support. This site is full of caring people who will supply you with a range of things; hugs, positive comments, daft pics to make you laugh (yup we do that too). It is a place where you can express yourself and express every emotion you might be feeling, because there is no one right or wrong emotion on this path. I sincerely hope you have a close friend, loved one or family member to support you. If not we will all be here whatever the time of day to cheer you on or cheer you up Now you need to start giving your self time to express your emotions, be gentle with yourself and treat yourself like you would your child if they were ill.  Until the appointment keep posting and stay safe Hugs and positive thoughts Leolady56",

Typical how people crawl out of the woodwork with all of the questions but none of the answers, as it seems her brothers and sisters suddenly have. Have you thought about the impact on your children if you do have mom in your home? Could this be a further stress. I realise 100% you have missed them. But is it a good idea? Will you need to put a room aside for her? Is there equipment going to be needed to ease her pain and help with moving her or seeing to her personal needs? Maybe these answers are on the Carers thread as they will know from experience. Is there no way her GP or hospital team could find a place in a hospice/ nursing home near you? This is probably the best solution in my eyes. Everyone can visit as much or as little as they want. As you are breaking point then seek help for you too. GP or here are good. I hope you do find the answer for your mom. And that is the way to put it to her family. Best solution for her Take care Leolady56",

If you are having radiotherapy this month, this is the place to ask questions, get support and chat to others going through it at the same time. If driving daily don't forget to ask if they offer free parking, most do :). And keep lathering the lotions on your site. The Radiotherapy tips  thread contains all sorts of tips posted by breast group members to help you get through radiotherapy. My tips having just completed RT: drink plenty of water; use plenty of cream and for several weeks after (Aveeno was my favourite one); rest when your body tells you to; accept help and befriend the RT Team.

Some people would say better than Aveeno and others not. The Aloe Vera cooled in the fridge was needed. As were the Actiform gel pads which the RT unit gave me. Again these gel pads aren't supplied by all trusts but can be bought off that well known Ama***** website. Now I found these the best ever, instantly removing residual heat. Lots of ladies just stick to their usual creams and some are even told to avoid deodorant especially if the armpit area is being zapped too. Yup keep taking the tablets .... as they say.  And drink plenty of water I finished 4 months ago ...... OMG where did that time go ........ but every day after my shower I moisturise as I find it gets itchy if I don't.

Then when the batteries are recharged you can hit the onco. After my rubbish experience I hid for 48hrs. Didn't leave the house and barely posted. Taht's what I needed -  some me time. My daughter has 'Become a priority in your life' on her FB page as she spent last year battling her eating disorder. I think that is a really good motto for us all. I kinda like this one too.

      "Content": "Good morning from a soggy town sat in a caravan Hope you don't mind me popping on to add my knowledge to the group. Though at least one of you will have heard from me before. I needed 3 x WLE's to remove a tiny tumour (2mm), and DCIS. The surgeon was in the job of saving my breast and saving my life whilst maintaining clear margins . That is basically what he said to me. I am now happy this happened though totally confused and basically very worried at the time. And very oh woe is me. There are very clear guidelines and should be adhered to. If in doubt 'shout' up and ask . Hopefully you have a good BC Nurse who you could ask or go for a 2nd opinion. I have needed to do so due to a less than competent oncologist. It happens. But at the end of the day it is your body, your decision Take care and be gentle with yourselves in the coming months. Be your best friend each and every day Leolady56",

No quoting me as I have NO medical knowledge but ........ I do believe a form of anti depressant can be given. This may make you throw your hands up in despair or relief. But you must say.

He was afraid that the damage Pac could do permanently was more of a worry than keep going. And like Ruby Rose I had my Herceptin cut short to 9 out of 18, just last week tbh. And I am so pleased as I spent yesterday being assessed for an issue with my heart (pericarditis) Now .......... oncos are highly professional trained people and are doing all of this to protect you. You know in your heart that is the case I am sure. But like me I guess you think \"but chemo is my safety blanket for it not recurring\". Well in Sept I had my one year mammo and I am all clear.

No brainer then sewing machine here I come  Take care and keep us all in stitches Leolady56 aka Lindsay",

Have your pics in a folder on your pc 2, The fifth little screen on the right on this tool bar, Click on that 3. Then you will get an insert/edit media screen 4. Click on Browse and open your folder of pics 5. Click on OPEN to upload in your folder's bar 6. Ideally cut down the dimensions to 300 by 300 or less (mac site not good with big pics) 7. Hit green insert button and the pic should appear that you chose. 8. Pray 9. Curse 10.

I have officially made a complaint about Wazcock to PALS. Now funnily enough my treatment and meetings have moved faster than the speed of light. I even had 2 phone calls from my new guy, met him yesterday and he is simply the best (I had met him back in 2015 after DCIS). He remembered every thing about me and asked what I and my hubby would like to be known as. He is amazeballs even when he is dishing out chemo. I really feel that your guy needs a large boot shoved somewhere.  The lovely Dreamthief knows his stuff so look up the suggestions.I even copy and paste some of the advice in case I need it in the future. I know you may not want to make a complaint but ......... it is unacceptable in my opinion. I worry about people who do not have a strong voice or who have not found here to express themselves. Rant over on your bealf Take care and ignore the wazcock and move on if you can. Be gentle with yourself too Leolady56",

I'm hoping that you have found this site the best for supplying support and knowledge, there are other reputable ones. BUT ..... dear Dr G is known for some seriously iffy sites, bad advice, old advice and purely wrong advice. So do keep to the reputable ones or be very wary of the rest.

We do have a specific thread which I will put the link for you but ..... My top tips: 1. drink lots of fluids, try to avoid coffee or drinks that will dehydrate 2. Use the cream on the area 3/4 times per day, but not to close to when you have RT (I expect you have been told that) 3. accept support to drive you to and from the session, especially at the end . RT is a slow burner and tends to hit you near the end and after. 4. as soon as you notice any major changes tell the RT team there are plenty of meds out there to help 5. Ask if the unit use Actiform Cool pads or look them up on Amazon. They were a blessing for me. They took the heat out of the area quickly Good luck with it all RT Thread Link Leolady56",

I decided bright red lipstick for chemo and radiotherapy (RT). I loved the pic and it made me smile on those crappy days Galligirl gave some lovely warm and positive thoughts. I liked my wig so much I am thinking of growing my hair to that style. I lost my hair 2/3 chemos in at the end of May and.......... now have a full head of curly hair. BUT ....... I have hair.

If you are having radiotherapy this month, this is the place to ask questions, get support and chat to others going through it at the same time. If driving daily don't forget to ask if they offer free parking, most do :). And keep lathering the lotions on your breast and surrounding area. The Radiotherapy tips  thread contains all sorts of tips posted by breast group members to help you get through radiotherapy. You can use this link to refer back to the MayRadiotherapy Club.\u2028 You can use this link for far more extensive information info about Breast Radiotherapy. While this page covers any possible Side Effects From Radiotherapy treatment - Both at BCC website. Keep going lovely people: It\u2019s one more step along the world we go. Leolady56",

Up your water intake too. 2-3 litres if you can. Only one day I didn't and boy did I feel the side effects of not. And plenty of cream to rest of body too, has a habit of drying out your skin. I've been lucky to be given gel pads to put on each evening which are amazing.I wear one at night to remove the heat. Actiform Cool. If your hospital not good try your GP. If you can add in a little bit of exercise and practise lying with arms above head in a relaxed way. Although it can be minutes it can be 15 or more if they are imaging. Not sure if your hospital offers weekend appts. Mine does and I took them makes it all a LOT quicker, no worries as all machines are up and working and staff want to get home for some of their Sunday. Didn't even get time to sit down today and was whisked in It is so so doable in comparison to what else we have all experienced. Gentle hugs help you through this Leolady56",

      "Content": "yellowdaffodil  Well a warm welcome to this thread then and come July there will be a new thread and sadly no doubt more people to share this treatment part with. 10 sessions of RT for me , so halfway. I've really had only 2 days where I felt wiped out. One being yesterday, so an early bed . But apart from a one hour journey there and a one hour journey back, plus some waiting time I have managed to walk a little. Apart from the other day when I managed 10km. I've started to do things like park further away from the RT unit (not too difficult with parking in an Oxford hospital!!!) Plus if you can you'll probably wait up to 3/4 weeks before RT starts so get moving now but gently does it. Also prepare the breast area if you can with a good non perfumed cream. I , and lots of others, swear by Aveeno. Do it 2/3 times per day and cover a good area spreading around the site. Mine is a right breast issue so I cover all of my chest, down to my tummy and around the back with cream. RT people gave me a pat on the back for that.  100% drink plenty of water. I think I was feeling rough yesterday as I had not taken enough on board and forgot to take a bottle with me. Plus I was rushing out trying to miss the traffic, so was lazy and did not stop to buy a bottle. Grr idiot. So plenty of fluids. At RT unit I was given some gel slabs called Actiform Cool. AMAZING. Pop one on and the heat is gone. Best thing in all this poop so far Well hoping all goes well for you and congrats for surviving the poop that is chemo. This next part will be so much easier Leolady56",

Not fully shaved off as you want to avoid nicking your head. Seriously do not need an infection from a cut at the moment Then rock scarves and hats. I bought some online and sent them back poor quality for me. I looked up on youtube wrapping scarves and found the one I could do easily and I liked. Got my freebie wig which was fine Good luck lovely lady you certainly have had a time of it Leolady56",

      "Content": "SarahSS123 Well lovely lady a warm but a very sad welcome if you need to join this club. We are trying to keep it very exclusive but cancer has other ideas. Notice I have said 'if', the results will determine the outcome. What you need to know is that if it is breast cancer, the world of medicine is a very different place day to day than many years ago. And what was a head in hands scenario back several years ago is now not so true for more and more people. There are so many targeted treatments, all being made as easy as is humanly possible for us all to manage.  2mm is very small indeed, have you looked at a ruler to see. So they have caught it very early which is fantastic news. My tumour was 3mm. Once the know the type of cancer it is from pathology reports they will chose the best course of treatment if needed. You will have the opportunity to agree or not. Or take time to decide. The anxiety and fear are to be totally expected you have a lovely little one to love and care for, so why would you not feel this way. In the coming weeks of waiting you may experience a whole range of emotions and not one of them is right or wrong, it just is. On here you will find a band of non judgemental people who have just been diagnosed; are having treatment and ones who are on the other side. They will pop on and give you amazing support, guidance and virtual hands of friendship One big cry from everyone will be avoid other sites that are not reputable. Dr Google does throw up some outdated information and some quite scary I am hoping you have a good group of family and friends to deliver all the support they can. There are Groups here for partners, family and friends too if they need help understanding you and the possible cancer. As the support network around you cannot actually battle cancer 'if' that what it is then allow them to help you in whatever way they can and also tell them you may ask them to 'back off' if it all gets too much. when you have answers we will be here to point you in the right direction of any further support you need Until then make you the priority in your life for now Gentle hugs  Leolady56 - who has just about finished her 10 month battle/argument/war with breast cancer.   ",

I must admit having been on this site for many months now and as a volunteer Champ, the dilemma and the question has been discussed many a time. That is in no way to make light of the situation for you but to say \"Hell yes many people have faced this challenging decision too.\" So no doubt others will come by and share their thoughts . If the consultant has recommended chemo they are not doing this lightly. they will have looked at all the variables and will have met with the multi disciplinary team (MDT) to discuss your mum's case. That will be their perspective and at the end of the day it is your mum's choice.  I chose not to have RT (radiotherapy) back in 2015 and I found myself back here in 2017 with more to deal with. Because of my decision in 2015 I took whatever they have wanted to throw at me. I stopped beating myself up about the decision in 2015 and stop using negative language about it too. And that will be something for your mum to consider. IF ( and no one has a crystal ball) cancer came back would she be angry/upset/annoyed with herself? Or will she say \"that was then and this is now\".  Will she constantly question the efficacy of her decision or will she be fine with it.  Sadly STATs are not actual people who can supply considered advice. 1% is small as you say, but ..... I am not too sure if I have helped but in sharing - as do here - maybe it will add to her decision making process Whatever her decision be aware that we will be here and we can signpost you to groups for chemo/ RT or AI (hormone treatment) support chats Be gentle with yourself and please do note that there are groups to support you too, should you feel the need of them Leolady56 - 1 year on and clear ",

Ive got to be honest I used my meditation techniques .... focus on the breathe .... that way I stayed relaxed  Can\u2019t help but wonder what was so different today? The staff what they needed  Paracetamol really???? Not a relaxant.  Try again and maybe one of the crew will have an answer. Or try tonight lying in the position and focus on the breathe.  Just a thought ..... my hands were gently clasped/ lay across one another for some sessions. Might that help.

Then there are the vast majority of people who fall between those 2 extremes. And sadly no test will tell you which category your lovely mum will fall into. But as NiceCuppa has said (and she is in the middle of it all) we do have a thread. The opening page has advice and the rest is filled with chats and more advice as well as support from those going through it all. Knowing which chemo she will have can help us suggest possible side effects (SE's) as chemo comes in all sorts of cocktails. Now to be honest I never knew that until I came to here and experienced chemo myself. Aha both you and Nicecuppa were up at \"silly o'clock\". The gremlins of fear and worry and doubt have a nasty habit of calling in at those times.  Now rest assured everyone here will do all they can to be of support. The oncology/ chemo team around your mum will be the same. She will get a card giving her an out of hours service to call if worried. CALL IT for any reason you or she are worried, they are there to prevent your mum feeling too ill Right click here to get you to the chemo chat LINK the opening page has info Be gentle with yourselves these coming weeks and months.

So it is doable Shirley, If this 60 something can get through it then you can too should that be the case. I think mine was a welcome to retirement present from someone well they can bleeping have it back. But I am here and got the all clear back last October.  One of the big reasons why I am here is because of here and all the support, guidance and hands of friendship I was given. You see everyone on here 'gets it'. They have first hand knowledge and they don't say silly things So once you have the results do pop in as we love a celebration. but do fill your days with good things.

If you are here on the site there will be plenty of sound advice from people who have been there and done it, all in a non judgemental way.

Which has meant Herceptin injections and Letrozole, not too much fun but doable and as I always say 'I'm not keen on the alternatives'!! You probably have DCIS as I did and sometimes it is so widespread they need to get it all, they did with me which took 3 ops. Now I have a perky small boob that points upwards and a saggy old one pointing down. But at 62 I am still here and to be honest who is looking at MY boobs We all sincerely hope you come back to the thread you have created and post how things are going. Maybe in the future when you are well enough you can join us all in a meet up, which we do fairly often. So we can share the times together and finally give real hugs Until then pop back here.

      "Content": "LucyMc Sad smile from me that you and more over your mom needs to be here. But unconditional support and non judgemental advice abounds around here, all from people being treated and surviving the poop that is BC and I can tell you now a whole new vocab for this poop is needed. One year on and words trip off the tongue that 12 months ago I never knew existed I am guessing at 62 I may be a similar age to your mom. Click on my name and read my profile. Not a walk in the park but ...... still here. And maybe no need to read the crappy bits to mom. there are many great survivor stories too. Each month we have a chemo thread LINK the first page filled with useful tips. Then pages of women supporting one another through this If you mention the hospital on here without giving away where you all live, you may well find others know the team or the oncologist or are there at the same time.  Herceptin is a great game changer in the fight against HER2 BC. But can come with a few side effects (SE's). Achy joints and muscles. But as with chemo , radiotherapy (RT) all will have SE's and your mom needs to NOT put up with them. There are lots of meds to help. For you there are other groups too. Family and friends link Actually this is such a warm,safe and caring site and filled with people who KNOW. Try hard to all avoid DR Google - too many outdated items to trawl through Enough bombarding of info Now you have created this thread keep posting here, join other groups or other threads. But ask away Take care and gentle hugs Leolady56",

And even now I can feel the odd twinge and yelp type pain as something settles back into place. Trouble being is we all have different pain thresholds dependent on what we have experienced before. Above all the mention of heat, redness and excessive swelling are game changers and you really MUST seek medical advice. It is more than likely an infection and a dose of antibiotics is the answer. I had one mid operation 2-3. I soon got the benefits of the meds. But remember your BCnurse is still there for you should you want a reassuring chat. That's their job Take care and go gently. Remember all the advice about lifting etc and try your exercises, but stop if they really ache Leolady56",

I walk most days, go to a Rock choir, go out with family and friends and even managed 5 days in France to see my daughter and her family.  I think the major issue is how tired I get to be honest. Then again I am 61!! And have worked for 38 years until I retired, so maybe add that to all the BC and you get tired. I looked at different places to get answers and support. Here as you say lots of threads and so many people been there and done it. Still walking the walk. Talking the talk. Yes you will find people who are down, have bad experiences, question lots but they have a right to feel this way. As you will have every right to feel they way you will each and every day Right. Remember keep posting and take care. One day at a time a very positive attitude. Let tomorrow take care of itself and yesterday is in the past, you can't turn back time  Leolady",

My main word of advice would be to contact your BC nurse or the team. You may need for someone to actually see the areas and make a professional medical diagnosis . Second piece of advice; keep to reputable sites and avoid Dr Google. Too many outdated and plain scary sites that are not reputable. Stick to the ones you know. Down is okay; as are ranting screaming laughing and every emotion known to mankind. As generally at some point we all have a poop day and have a go at everyone. Now you have found here pop back on and share. Off load here or ask as many questions as you need to. Maybe someone will come along and have some good advice Until then be gentle with yourself Leolady56",

I feel 100% certain the hospital you attended and the surgeon you had  will have a formal complaints system. I feel sure you need to get in touch with them Are you in the UK? I am assuming so. In the NHS most (repeat most) people have to wait 2 maybe 3 weeks.Even then everyone gets very concerned, worried and stressed This wont explain attitude  is not acceptable you are entitled to the information. You should be getting letters both to you and your GP. Have you asked your GP? They should know. I found the following online: The first step is the hospital. Each private hospital has a Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director or Hospital Director. He/she is responsible for everything that goes on in the hospital.  Each private hospital and private hospital group has a complaints procedure If you need some further support with how this affecting you emotionally, the 0808 number on every page is great.

But what I do want to say to you is this: When we were diagnosed no one gave us a handbook that said 'This is how you will feel. This is how to deal with it. Oh and this is what you should have done.' If they had, none of us would be here and there would be no need for this site. But we are all here and we are all doing it, living it in our way. But what we have all found is a safe, friendly, kind and non judgemental site where we can share our feelings.  Do not be ashamed of yourself for how you feel. If you can recognise those feelings, give them some space to exist and then move on. I post some days, erase it then write something I would like to hear instead. But by scribbling it down I feel better. There is a place on this site called The Room - where you can do just that. Or post on this thread and someone will come along and help. Hopefully you have found the dedicated thread for those experiencing CT . Link here Please give yourself time to mend and be gentle with yourself.

Reason why they were trashed because 16 months from diagnosis and got the all clear. So it\u2019s poop. It\u2019s big poop. But it\u2019s doable poop Think your diagnosis has shown cancer in the lymph nodes so hence chemo. Now let\u2019s be honest some people have a full on crap time and then others go to work whilst on chemo. Then there is everyone else in between. And yes the bugger of it is until we started filling up our bodies with chemo no one knows where we will fall on that line. Do check out this site and in the BC group we have a specific chemo chat group set up each month for everyone to share the poop and support one another . And rant. And laugh.

Glad you have found here as there are many people going through what you are and they will be supportive and give you great advice. It is not fair that you are a fit person and yet cancer has come to call. That doesn\u2019t particularly help our emotional or mental response to it. But as you will see cancer hits everyone no discrimination from cancer Chemo has no plan, map or manual. Sad to say. Many people get on with life, work, bring up the kids and others don\u2019t . We all only wish there was a magic formula to say which one we will be so at least we can prepare for it. So help ..... look down the threads and you will see there is a specific group/ thread for chemo. I would put a link but on my phone. Laptop gone into meltdown I had a gentle brush with chemo. I allowed myself the days to mend when I felt like poop. Then I shook it off and tried to do all the usual things. And I accepted help. People can\u2019t fight the cancer but they can ease the stress and give help. Just tell them if I say no thanks I mean NO. Others will be along to give support Until then make you the priority in your life and be a little selfish or a lot!! Leolady56",

But my beautician uses semi permanent make up approach not microblading. Many others have had it done and were very happy. BUT ...... get it done sooner rather than later. The reason being infection. And not whilst undergoing chemo for the same reason. During chemo the fewer bugs we attract the better. Many people have a good time with chemo and others have every available crap side effect (SE). We never know until we start when and if it all kicks off.  LINK we have a thread each month for the chemo time. of treatment You will find the first page has many great tips and is filled with people holding out a hand of friendship during this challenging time Hope all this helps Do keep posting. Share all the crappity crap crap, the emotions, the tears and fears, the laughter too. At 62 being asked to pee in a pot to see if I was pregnant I mean REALLY.

But that is really me responding in this way and my onco was slightly surprised by both reactions. The second one, which I have on Thursdays, I sort of lost the weekend and a 'I am not feeling too well/ achy way/ headaches'. Thursday and Fridays are good probably thanks to the steroids. But thanks to the steroids not too much sleep - felt buzzy.  Third one this week - small BLEEP up on the part of ward last week, miscommunication - so shall report back.  Everyone has said it is the gentlest of chemos but is a slow creeping one, so you can be hit harder as the week's progress. And having chosen not to go with the cold cap - my BP gives me enough crappy headaches - I am losing my hair.  Well the sun is in the sky. So lather on the lotion and enjoy a chemo free day.

I\u2019m not au fait with your cancer - thank the Lord I just kept to my brand- but your BCN May have got it right. And I assume the surgeon knew his stuff. Plus an MDT who discussed it all.  I\u2019m thinking your \u2018imagined consequences\u2019, as you eloquently describe it all, is just another fun side effect of the poop that is cancer. The emotional and mental SE of cancer, well tbh one of them . What ifs seem to come by the cart load no matter where you are in this poop. No matter how many years past the finishing line I\u2019 m on my phone and can\u2019t put a link but there is a good article by Peter Harvey about life after cancer. You could see if you could find it or I\u2019ll pop by tomorrow with a link . I took several goes to read it, I need to be in the correct head space to absorb it all. But it gave me some hope once I\u2019d read it that I was not losing the plot or alone. This site also gives me strength and support  There has been a change in how some surgeons and oncologists use the Predict tool and after 16 months on here I see it mentioned less and less. I think it is considered a blunt tool these days.  Right apologies for any weird typos. Do keep writing and parking your worries here.

Lots of people experiencing breast cancer and though it seems like one title, it is in fact many diagnosis and many ways of treating it dependent on so many factors. I too needed not 2 but 3 operations from Nov to Jan to get clear margins. It is distressing to think for whatever reason they did not get everything the first time around, but Lavendergirl has given you the reasoning behind it.  When I was very distressed at the 3rd operation I demanded to speak to my consultant. He told me very calmly and reassuringly that he was in the business of saving my breast and me. That 2nd and 3rd operation meant I knew what to expect, how I would feel physically and emotionally, how it would all mend and what I could or couldn't do as I was mending. A lady I met during my 2nd operation is now nearing the end of radiotherapy. I am just a few weeks behind but I know when I start the next course of treatment I will be in a good place both mentally and physically, because the professionals made the right decisions at the time. When or if you or your relative return to the site there are lots of conversations regarding Radiotherapy, recovery etc etc. There is also a Carers site should you feel the need. When the time comes you can be signposted to the support. Hope all goes well for you both Fill their days with positive things until the next op. Take care and be gentle with yourselves Leolady56",

Many sites on other search engines are NOT as reliable nor updated or have anyone checking their credibility There is the number for MacMillan that your relative can contact during the day if she needs further support and maybe if she is techy savvy she can join on one of the threads. 0808 808 00 00 is the number Do keep posting on this thread you have created.

Or are you preparing for what may happen when you see the consultant next? I am not a medic, just someone who has been there with BC. I am pretty damn sure HER2 + tends to be attacked with chemo after surgery and more than likely Herceptin. They will not give Herceptin as a general rule without chemo. Plus an AI - Tamoxifen, Letrozole etc for 5-10 years after LINK click here for info on HER2+. on the site STOP PRESS. I just read your profile so please ignore some of this. Apologies, as not everyone fills their profiles  in, if I seemed a little vague. WELL........  I am surprised because at 62 and HER2+++ I was a definite candidate for chemo and Herceptin. For various reasons I didn't go the whole 9 yards with them both, but felt I had enough of a fair crack at them. And Oct 2018 pronounced clear after 1 year mammogram. ( I have completed my profile so read away) Have you had a one year mammogram yet? That could definitely calm fears and worries, mine did. (OK for another year) Take care and be gentle with yourself.

I actually said to my lovely onco man. I\u2019ve been living in this body for 61 years I think I know what\u2019s me. We were discussing my BP. He listened and agreed that we would work within a certain BP range  ( just to say I looked back to see BO and not BP.

BUT .... it did mean i got to enjoy this lovely weekend weather Made my big decision today.......... the hair clippers are n charge. Got to the point where the hair loss each day is more distressing than the thought of shaving it all off. Mr Leo really upset about it. I went for retail therapy and ordered some pre-made scarves/headgear; phoned and made wig fitting appts. Oh well wont be spending the kids inheritance on holidays this year instead it will be chemo cheer up purchases. Gentle  hugs chums Leolady56",

It was a long day as needed to wait for chemo which was arriving from Wycombe!! I always feel great on day 1 and 2 but crash at some point 3 and 4. Definitely chemo and steroid crash. My daughter said some children become The Incredible Hulk on steroids. So much so for one young lad they needed security to help contain him !!! Bleeeeeping heck  My BP is up. Mmmm . Grrr. But GP said 170+ is my worry zone(not 270  as I typed). So all have fingers tightly crossed I stay below and no midnight sorties to A&E. Hope Annie you get a good sleep and so do we all.

But do make sure that the Ibuprofen and Paracetamol are managed well ( when ill before BC  I made a school girl error, made me worse). The fluids is essential especially as it could be quite a warm day. BUT .... as I am queen of the high blood pressure. Cracking headaches are part of that and nothing can be done to get rid of that, apart from BP meds. If you have a BP machine or access to one then check it out. Or get it done tomorrow asap. Just a thought. Some pharmacies have them as well. Avoid coffee or caffeinated ones as they do clear fluids from your body.

      "Content": "Sue JH  I'm off the Paclitaxol journey see masses of previous posts and all my weird responses. I managed 3 but onco then stopped the train for me. Mixed emotions there I too had insect bites etc that went itchy and raw. I tried Eumovate which I had for a previous rash response (after surgery) that did not work so now I have an antibiotic cream, Fusidic which is slowly hitting the spots (so to speak). Just thought I would mention this to you as trouble with a steroid cream is it can over a length of time breakdown the skin's layers. So if all does not clear up maybe ask for an antibiotic cream. Just a thought. My 3 Pac definitely gave me: headaches, joint aches, nose bleeds, hair loss and dodgy tummy both ways, with some cramping tummy pains. I would say that these lasted no more then 2/3 days. Made sure drank water so hopefully I avoided cystitis.SE's wiped out my weekend but ...... retirement means every day is a Sunday. Pac is a bit of a slow burner with SE's creeping slowly up, but is considered a gentle form of chemo Hope you continue to tolerate Pac and that the SE's are treated - there are plenty of meds out there to battle the poop Hugs to you all Leolady56",

I\u2019d worked hard to get my BP sorted and on just 2.5 mg. Niecthis damned BC has put me back  My onco has kept me on Herceptin even though I did finish chemo. For which I am so grateful.

Sometimes that is all we need and our family/friends have probably had quite enough of listening to them. I was going to suggest the V-shaped pillow sold in many shops and online. That may give hubby a few more inches! Mine eloped/sloped off to the spare bed when I was post op. Stage 2 is a plus as that's early doors and caught quickly - as with most things size doesn't matter!!! Ahem. Obviously if a greater stage then size does. Nodes clear another plus. No critters have escaped to run rampant. Hold onto that thought. Everyone, just like Lesley Helen, says M&S are tops for bras. I am searching for non underwired that don't make me look droopy!!! After a battle with an eating disorder last year my daughter went to MS and found them amazing. Obviously she had/has body image issues. She said they were very professional and it was as if you were just another person in their day (in a good way).

      "Content": "Hello there Welcome to the site. One you probably didn\u2019t know existed and certainly one you never thought you would visit. How I so wish that someone on this site,including me, could give you the definitive answer. Then you could breathe a big sigh of relief and nod off into dreamland. Sadly that is not what I can do and that\u2019s so NOT what you wanted to read. On this site everyone  has cancer or signs of cancer in the breast but that is where it begins and ends. Some people didn\u2019t have a clue. Some people like you found lumps. Some just felt unwell. Or their breast had changed. Mine was hello again at my yearly mammogram  The best thing is that you have been referred to a specialist who will be able to test in many different ways to see what this lump is. That might be manual, mammogram, ultrasound biopsy or the lot. But what they will do is everything they can to find the answer. When you feel you can you could search on this site for diagnosis. The second best thing you have done is to come here to a reputable site, where facts are given. Where there are experts to ask. Where there are lots of people experiencing the same worries as you and have a list of questions as long as your arm. Because on here you will get people who will offer answers, offer support and guidance. They will offer the virtual hand of friendship and all in a kind, caring and non judgmental way.  If you are here for a few days, weeks or months people will cheer you on and cheer you up. Now everyone will say don\u2019t think about it. And you might shout easy for you to do I\u2019m the one waiting. But there will possibly be a lot of waiting time for results and tests in the coming weeks. So find a good way to deal or cope with it. Some people post daily. Others wait. Some fill their days with work or good things. Some post all night see The Awake thread by tapping on the discussion tab. As I am on my iPad I can\u2019t put links which would help. Apologies. Maybe another Champ can if needed But above all keep posting. Stay on reputable sites. Share your concerns with a loved one or a friend.  We will be here when you need support Be gentle with yourself Take care Leolady",

Weirdly the best part is that people are living or have lived it - not that you'd wish this on anyone. There are a few threads you might want to glance into or stick with this thread you created. If chemo or radio/RT are part of your treatment we have designated threads to share the poop of it all. Be prepared for some waiting times too, as often this plays with the brain cells. Everyone wanting an answer yesterday Mmmmmmm onco guy!!! Hope he learnt a lesson. Still I got one of the top oncos eventually Take care.

Look into NICE site there is a long paper about it Now the font of much knowledge is Dreamthief now the lovely George does an early shift and hopefully by my tagging him there may be an answer from him Strange how we panic when the Oncos or surgeons cast us aside.

      "Content": "Trapin1 Yes and no. Yes letrozole can certainly cut back the desire for affection, emotions can be depressed and sexual desire certainly can be affected. There has been a lot of discussion of creams to use for vaginal dryness. Estriol and Sylk being mentioned. But if I am being totally honest with you - and I don't know you - all I have to go on is this post. I am thinking Letrozole is just a part of the jigsaw of your life at present. The other parts are quite defining moments in our lives. Surviving cancer, work changes, family changes. Just one of those could send anyone of us over the edge. The mending of our emotional and mental health is not a priority for the medics and I just wish it was. So we need to find ways to mend for ourselves. If that for you means tablets then why not? If it is for the coming days your lifebelt then so be it. If one counsellor didn't hit the mark there are others you can access. Seek out places where you can meet with other people who have survived BC or other cancers. Maggies Centres and Breast Cancer Care have courses to attend. Macmillan centre near me does relaxation drop in sessions. I so find 1 hr to myself good. I opened my eyes after the first session to find I was crying and to think I thought I had got BC licked. On a personal and professional note (others may not see or acknowledge this) OMG teaching is a draining profession. 38 years I did. Enjoy the retirement. I loved every day as every day was different, but that also meant some days sucked the life out of you. Yes, everyone else I know those committed to other jobs may well feel the same too. But I am just saying as one professional to another. Do keep posting as here is also an amazing source of support as you may know Have you read this article too?

Do you have a vaseline to create a barrier against infection creeping in. As we all know our immune system is compromised during chemo and the very last thing we all need is an added infection creeping in through cuts and abrasions. Gloves might help especially if you are in the kitchen Did a medic see the skin issues? If not, to be perfectly honest I would give the Triage people a call. Possibly need a steroid / hydrochortisone type cream - but would need a prescription and diagnosis for that. Hope you have a triage number They are there to be of help and no question is too silly - only if it is left too late Leolady56 - good luck lovely",

On here we can give advice and support through experience not necessarily as medics I have not experienced exactly what your wife has, but wanted to add a few thoughts in as to what needs looking at before Monday. Always heat in wounds or areas such as you describe after an operation. By comparing the 2 breasts and the heat found in the same area. Also checking her temperature in case of infection. See if it spreads or fills with fluid.If any of these are present then 111 call or a call to out of hours GP service (if your surgery has this).  My experience was an infection which required antibiotics after my first operation. That I discovered due to excessive heat and redness. Avoiding any clothing that could be irritating the area. Linen or cotton, loose tops.Removing the bra. Aloe Vera that has been in the fridge can be very cooling and gently dabbed onto the area to relieve itching. Aloe vera easily available in many shops I hope my simple ideas may be of help to your wife. I am sure other people may have better answers Take care both of you.  Leolady56 aka Lindsay",

There is this conversation tap the link. You may well find excellent advice and guidance there. I am sure you will. Remember your BC Nurse is also a good port of call, butI know that can take time for a reply (for me usually 24hrs). The nurse expert on here will also answer but that can be 48hrs before you here Hoping you get some clear positive answers, and knowing that you will get amazing support, positive thoughts and guidance from this site Do keep posting as someone will always come along to offer a hand of friendship Leolady56",

If we have been very active people I think it can hit harder or if we have family then feel like we are not keep up our end of the bargain. The psychological side / emotional / mental side is saying 'Shezza take it easy. Let the chemo do its job and you rest up. Don't battle it.' There that's my way of dealing with it. A friend told me to say it was magic medicine - mmmmmm not too sure about that but. hope that you do find your way to the thread as the group there at present are amazingly supportive of one another.

      "Content": "Roundhouse1  A warm welcome to the site but equally so sorry you have needed to find us. And more importantly that your mom has been diagnosed with breast cancer and is finding it all overwhelming  I am 62. I was diagnosed 11 months ago and I am still here. If I think about how breast cancer was dealt with in the past and think about women I knew who were diagnosed their life was quite short. But medicine and the battle against cancer has moved a million miles from then. Maybe your mom is thinking of the past and is unaware of what is available now to battle and win this. Or maybe she is \u2018overwhelmed \u2018 You could mention this all to her breast cancer nurse who can advise you and her how to deal with it all. The team supporting your mom might find it useful to know that they are going to have to help her battle the physical, emotional and mental sides of breast cancer. You can all phone the helpline on here 0808 808 00 00. Advice and guidance will be given in a non judgemental way. Don\u2019t forget the GP too they are great, well mine is. They can signpost you to help Feel free to tap on my name and read my story to your mom. It\u2019s not a straight forward one and does not include a mastectomy but I am here. I had - past tense - HER2 +++ and I have 3 weekly Herceptin plus Letrozole. There is no road map, manual or dvd given when we discover we have breast cancer. There is no one reaction that is right or wrong . There will be a host of emotions running through each and everyone of you throughout this and again not one is right or wrong. They just are.  There is Family and Friends part of the site and a Carers part if you look in Groups section. There you will find support too. Sorry I am on my iPhone so I can\u2019t link you to them. When I get to my laptop I\u2019ll post stories of survival as well if you think they will help her to read or listen to No doubt others are writing as I do with good advice  It is staring over the precipice of life for some but now medicine, docs and forums like this can pull us back from the edge. Survival rates are high 95% + Take care and be gentle with yourself too Leolady56",

I feel that as this is really quite specific you will have to bite the bullet and speak to the BC Nurse. Mention your lack of good vibes from the surgeon and maybe they could arrange for you to see a member of the team. is your GP more helpful? Could that be a route to follow. Basically when things like this happen the gremlins of fear and doubt drop by that causes us to worry more; lose sleep and just get more agitated.

      "Content": "Mountainhiker Good morning from the UK. And sorry you find yourself here and that your mom has been through this. You say as your final comment 'cancer is such a whirlwind'and that is so so true.It would seem you have been swept up into and that you are at a complete loss to explain away the cruelty and uncertainty that it brings to everyone I think possibly the need to be private about health issues,especially those related to breast and womb cancer,can be a generational 'thing'. Also many people do not want the cancer to define them or for others to change their attitudes towards them. Nor do they want their children to necessarily become their carers orput their lives on hold. As to how long you have got left with your mother???? How long is that piece of string?? That is rather cruel answer, but any day of the week we could fall foul of a reckless driver or pick up a bug that takes away our life.You say that her cancer is a slow growing cancer and no mets on vital organs. All good signs It is time to make the very best memories you can and surround her with love. In the incurable group on the site, people are there 5/6 years on from diagnosis. And as you science gallops on and new meds appear with regularity I haven't necessarily answered your question,but truly can the medics? The people posting here are (like me) living with or surviving cancer.We do have an Ask an Expert section where you may get a fuller medical answer. We have many groups here that you may find very helpful Friends and Family HER2+ information from the site I wish your mother a gentle way through the treatment and for you the strength to be a loving son May your gods be with Leolady56",

Hence why women post menopausal are encouraged to keep to a good BMI. Mmmm I missed that lesson until too late. Obviously I am still at the ripe old age of 61 and  producing oestrogen. I am not saying this the professionals are. Decisions regarding Tamoxifen, Letrozole etc etc will be based on HER status of your cancer, your age, pre and post menopausal. Plus a lot more factors depending on your general health.  But as the lovely wombat.23 has said we only hear of different side effects when they happen. Until now I rarely looked at the info in my meds package. Now I'm a positive demon and read every last word.

      "Content": "AmyKan2018 A very sad but warm welcome, as you say, to a group we did not know existed. This has certainly been a tough year for your family. The answers to your questions may seem quite vague but truth to tell so far you mention Stage 3 BC but there are many other pathology elements that will help the doctors decide on the way forward for treatment. Sometimes chemo is used to shrink a tumour first and for others it is used to ensure no stray cancer cells have escaped into the rest of the body. Pathology of the tumour will come from biopsies which you have not mentioned as yet. Some people take oral medication for 5-10 years,depending on the type of cnacer, which have side effects but save lives. I am on called Letrozole for 5-10 yrs  The pros and cons of private hospitals versus NHS is one that challenges many. The bottom line is the surgeons are often the same, not all hospitals private or NHS have the same equipment. I have heard of costs ranging from£10-15,000. A large sum One place where you will certainly get good advice is the helpline 0808 808 00 00. They are open until 8pm. They will point you in the right direction and may have advice about where your mother lives Wishing you all a gentle way through this Gentle hugs and positive thoughts Leolady56",

All I have had so far is 2 telephone chats with onco 2. My appointment is 13th and I was going to ask about Port as reading so much about  PICC and infections (sorry those who have them) So I will be almost 90 days post op when I start as NICE guidelines suggest no more than 31 there is a little bit of formal complaining from my side Pax is the first part, Herceptin as well then 20x Rads to follow. Onco said he will stop after 8 Pax if needed as I have had issues with my heart. Had rheumatic fever as a child, slightly enlarged heart, pericarditis in 2016 and high BP. Wooooo hooooooo. Today is Pneumococcal injection. Plus an echocardiogram and ECG next week. (blimey my spelling has improved all these words testing me). So could you all please keep paying your taxes as I don't want them to run out of money. I am off to have my injection after all the babies at 12 today. Made me giggle Well everyone on here I have a very weird sense of humour so be warned when I officially join the group. Not intended ever to upset just my pressure valve release. God bless to all those being zapped today, to those on a bad day. To those on a good day make it count. Leolady56 - ducking and diving PS Oh have a caravan to clean out! Mmmmmmm",

But I will be popping in to have a good idea what will be my path for the ensuing 12 weeks. Paclitaxel will be my onco's poison of choice and I remember your lovely comments about it being a wet velvet glove approach, it certainly allayed my worries. Well time to scoff some chocolate whilst I can enjoy it. Good wishes for all who join the thread for a gentle way forward to good health. Seeing this as my sabbatical year for getting well.

But noooooo we need to look at the tomato issue first. Luckily Onco man - nice onco man - was in residence. Oh that's a reaction to chemo!  So I had some anithistamines with me and we decided to take those one a day until next chemo. But if I react again it's back to the drawing board.  No reactions yet to Herceptin But 9-3.30 in the unit.  My daughter was great  Bit miffed. Bit confused. Bit WTF. Bit not again for those who have seen me go through various reactions after my ops. At least they are visible and obvious to the medics So how was you poop today. Oh yes I need to get Hemocane as well. Everything is just piling up and I've only done 2 bleeping days. This could be a War and Peace or Forsythe Saga read though LL and her chemo.

Whoops not a cheery thought but hope you all get what I mean. So finally today my BP is back to normal and the headaches have abated. Phew I have promised daughter to go to GP tomorrow.

My nurse had sheets printed off this site. Made me giggle Paclitaxol  tap the link to get info Herceptin info link My chemo nurse said no extras whilst on Pac. I took Vitc,d and zinc, but they are back in the cupboard until the end of chemo. But do check with yours your unit may be different Adriamycin can't answer that one for you but Mac link The veins and the hair sadly no perfect answer for those either. But ..... time to breathe.

And he is seeing so so many people without the correct knowledge I feel reading NICE guidelines a real joke and I am working on the wording of my reply to them.  maggiemee  Assassins take one step forward please to hit those bleeping cancer cells. I am hoping I will continue with Herceptin as so far no reaction to that.!!!! Good luck on Monday I will be following your way through the poop with interest. Apparently my new onco is very belt and braces, keeps strictly to protocols and known to be incredibly thorough hence why he is at least 30-60 mins late every appointment. Still better that than my last man. And more than anything my new guy I believe in Glad to hear the PICC was not an issue. Yes i had several xrays to check positioning throughout the whole procedure. It was comforting to know. I have had no issues (whisper that one really) and no pain or discomfort. Yes the chemo rash is around that area but ...... to be expected Well hoping for sleep tonight and no midnight munchies - though I now have a supply in the bedroom of healthy snacks.

A little bit of the weird humour hope you at least grimaced for me. Another thing I thought was are you near one of the new 'One stop hospital units'.?

Next week's Paclitaxol has been cancelled and I my onco on Friday. I am a little concerned as yesterday I watched the BBC Scotland prog about BC. An onco said the best medical advancement in the BC fight was Herceptin. Which I am booked to have. But I was lead to believe it is only delivered hand in hand with chemo! Struggled with sleep last night, munchies at 2am and hair falling! Joy and more joy I heard today that the formal complaint made about my last onco which has been upheld.
