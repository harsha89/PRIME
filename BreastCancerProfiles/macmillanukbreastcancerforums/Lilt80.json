      "Content": "Afternoon everyone. I have Grade 3 Breast Cancer. The cancer is in my left breast, and I have been told it's benign. However I have  3 metastatic lymph nodes. I'm awaiting an MRI Scan to see if I should have a mastectomy or wide local excision. I'm 36 years old and have been told my cancer is aggressive.   Does anyone else have advanced lymph nodes? ",

      "Content": "My aches and pains was unbearable for five days. I could not walk well and it felt like shooting pains around the whole body. I used a hot water bottle on my legs, shoulders and thighs, it seemed to calm it down. I would press the hot water bottle on the area that ache the most. Told my oncologist about this and she said it was ok for me to do that if it helped. ",
