      "Content": "Hi Jen I'm sorry you're not getting the support you need from your husband. Is this a usual reaction for him- what's he normally like if you're upset or if something goes wrong? Do you normally open up to each other about how you're feeling? If so, you may want to sit him down and have a good heart to heart. Maybe it hasn't really hit him yet as its only been a few weeks.  As an aside you are still deemed to be disabled under the equalities act even if the cancer has gone - see the attached Macmillan guide  www.macmillan.org.uk/.../EqualityAct2010.pdf",
