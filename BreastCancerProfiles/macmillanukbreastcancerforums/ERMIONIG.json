    "Content": "I'm also new to this site as I decided to join once I finished my last chemo,so I couldn't give advise that wasn't seen through 'smoked screened chemo glasses' as its a very distorted world that you live in whilst on chemo.As my boy used to often say this is 'chemo mummy'. I had 3 Tax & 3 Fec.When you're on such strong meds no-one tells you the mental battle that you have to go through to get through chemo.When I reached my 4th chemo I hit a brick wall and didn't think I would have the strength to carry on but I truly believe that with clean eating,juicing and organic where possible, it gave me the  goodness to carry on.I didn't get one single ulcer  as I had a spoonful of mauka honey +15 every day if not more on my porridge & drinking lots of lemon & honey. I know with  clean eating you're body has a chance to cope better with chemo side effects as you're putting in all the goodness you're body needs to fight this disease. Avoid sugars,I gave up sugars 3 years ago so when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2014 I felt that staying away from sugar helped me. You have to dig deep and distract from the aches by forcing yourself by going on walks no matter how short the walks are, get yourself moving as this genuinely helps as the more you lay there the worst you feel & the worst the pain gets.Having additional meds is more medication for you're body to get rid of ...find the solutions in 'you' not through more meds like morphine, chemo meds are meds that you need to fight the cancer & that's hard enough for you're body to cope with than giving you're body additional drugs to deal with. You must push yourself through it you're over the half way mark. Love Peace & Light x              ",
