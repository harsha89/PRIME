      "Content": "Hi JMC04, I haven't yet got the voucher for the wig but the Macmillan nurse told me of  a place locally where I could go and have a look and they would sort the voucher out with the hospital.  Perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind but I was a bit disappointed.  I seem to be running out of time now so I think I'll try and get one after the mastectomy and before the chemo starts. For anyone living in the Stoke/Stafford area  you might be interested to know that there is a new beauty salon at The Stafford and The Stoke hospitals catering exclusively for cancer patients called 'Fresh Hair'.  I spoke to a lovely girl at Stoke and she said they had hundreds of wigs to try.  Unfortunately they can't at the moment accept vouchers from outside their area (which I am) but she said I could buy one privately from them or if I found one I liked she would give me the details and I could try and get it locally so I could use the voucher. She stressed that they are a non profit making business just set up to help people like us. I can't believe all the travelling you are going to have to do to get treatment - poor you. I shall think of you. Katie x",

My surgery is booked for a week on Monday - the 21st, I'm seeing the consultant again this Tuesday so perhaps I will know more then.  He did say that chemo would start 3 - 4 weeks after surgery but I don't know how Xmas will impact on that.  I have a grade 3 tumour so I'm anxious to start chemo asap. I remember that my taste buds went awry last time (I particularly didn't like the taste of wine,which was very sad!). I've made an appointment to look at wigs next week - I didn't lose my hair last time but I know this is going to be a much longer course of chemo so expecting the worst!",

JMC04 - Apparently the hospital will give me a voucher to get a wig!  I've got an appointment to go tomorrow to have a look so I can decide on what I want before I start treatment.  I'm concerned about Christmas too - in a way hoping they will start the chemo before, because the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned, however from past experience I don't imagine they will start until after but on the other hand I want Christmas with my grandchildren. Having the mastectomy on Monday and hoping all will be well to go to my grandaughter's nativity play on the 6th of December,  I'm determined to get there with all drains clanking if necessary!!   XXX",

I had a mastectomy before I started the chemo so hopefully all will finish in a couple of weeks time. Katie",
