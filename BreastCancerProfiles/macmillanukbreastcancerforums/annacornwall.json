      "Content": "Hi Powlar I am only just going through chemotherapy but I think maybe if you are someone who really copes well with things then there is some point when you let your guard down and give into your underlying feelings especially when things have been positive. It's kind of like feeling that this luck (of not having a recurrence) can't last. I think it's a natural worry that is maybe better if you feel like you can accept it, a bit like grieving. Maggie I have read that there might be a link between malignant melanoma and breast cancer. I looked into at first because my mum had it whereas I've got breast cancer. This is interesting: http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma/melanoma-causes-and-risk-factors/melanoma-and-breast-cancer-a-new-warning",

      "Content": "I've had three tax so far and the pain seems to last for 2-3 days. Pain in the legs mainly comes from tax but all over the body is from the injection. The first one was definitely the worst and I had to ring the doctors because I was beside myself with aches and pains. I was given co-drydamol and the doctor said he give me something stronger. Hang in there and take some painkillers (I wasn't recommended ibuprofen and mine were paracetamol and codeine based) Hope you soon feel better. Anna ",

      "Content": "Hi, I am so sorry that you are going through this on your own. It's such a sad situation. I had exactly the same diagnosis. The margins were clear and I was given a choice as to whether or not to have chemo. I chose to have it as herceptin seeems to offer the best protection. I can't help much as I have only had one dose of chemo but it did knock me for six for about 5 days about five days afterwards, but everyone's treatment is different and it seems everyone has different reactions. How old are your sons? Are they able to help? I am lucky enough to have a supportive husband but I would join a breast cancer forum because there are many people who are very supportive and understand and also give lots of useful tips such as eating pineapple or drinking ginger beer as well as comparing medication. I'm glad you have a sister that is able to help. Take care, Anna",

      "Content": "Hi Clare  I've only had one so far - next one is on Monday so I'll let you know if it improves.  Today I went on a Look Good, Feel Better pamper day . It was good and you get a whole bag of really good cosmetics. I was referred by a BC nurse but I think you can get on it from the website - look under locations. Anyway I met other people from the area including one who was on the same chemo regime as me and she said she thought this one was quite tough - she has had chemo in the past and said it wasn't as bad. So maybe you might be put on a better one than I am on. Keep positive and take care, Anna x",

      "Content": "Hi Clare, Looking at your other replies just shows how different everyone is. I felt absolutely fine for the first three days. More tired because my sleep was disturbed but I wasn't sick at all. I had quite a bit of bone/muscle ache due to the injection that you get the day after treatment but had strong painkillers from the doctors. My biggest side effect was how it made me feel in my head from about day 5 to day 8. I don't know if this was worse because of lack of sleep, the chemo or the anti- sickness tablets that I was given. I can fully understand about your sons. My youngest is nearly 16 and he's been good at helping with jobs and cleaning but I don't think cooking is his strength! I also have an older son living at home and a daughter living abroad. I think the answer is probably to be well prepared. Have meals for you son that he can heat up for himself and you if you feel like it and maybe ask him to do some things like bring you tea or breakfast in bed if you don't feel like getting up some days.  You may feel absolutely fine - some people manage to work through the whole of their treatment and it might depend on what chemo you have. I am on something called TCH which seems to be a bit less common than others although the H is herceptin and the T is Taxotere which a lot of people have. Ginger beer (non alcoholic!) and any ginger products seem to make a lot of people feel better. I think it's because chemo can alter tastes - everything tasted of salt with me - even water so finding things that tasted normal was a bit of a relief. I can see how you don't want to put too much on your sister, but I'm sure she will want to help. After the first treatment you will probably have a better idea of how you will feel and you will probably only need her for a few days out of every cycle. I am having six sessions - one every three weeks- so it lasts 18 weeks with herceptin for a year although that seems to have comparatively few side effects. Take care and try not to worry too much, Anna",

I think the intermittent fasting reduces inflammation in your body which may have the same effects as the steroids everyone has to take. The one downside I can see is that many of the tablets cause constipation in the first week and I'm wondering if fasting might make that worse.",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy Thanks for the really comprehensive list! I am having chemo tomorrow so have cut out the obvious things this weekend but this makes it all a lot clearer. I don't know how far through the cycle I will go but thought I would cut down on carbs (usually my downfall) for the whole time but really concentrate on the the 48 hours before and a few days after. Seven portions of protein is quite a lot and although I use quorn sometimes, it's not very often so couldn't see me wanting that every day. I feel it is worth trying as I am doing an Open University course and could do with being able to think more than one week in three! I'll let you know how I get on and thanks again. Anna x",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy I would be really interested to know what you ate during this trial. I am vegetarian ( but don't eat fish) so can see the problem with the high protein bit. I'm more likely to do the 48 hr pre chemo diet. I am having my third session on Monday and am on TCH so Taxotere for 6 sessions. I have found it quite debilitating so have resigned myself for feeling wiped out for over half of the three week cycle, so anything I can try is worth it.  Is it just a case of cutting out carbs from bread pasta potatoes etc and were you able to eat cheese, yoghurt milk and eggs? And do you know whether quorn is ok? I would have sent you a message but I don't know how to do it! Thanks, Anna x",

      "Content": "Hi I am on 5 out of 6 of Tax ,Herceptin and also Carboplatin. The main side effects for me have been extreme tiredness and taste changes. It's hard to tell what effects are from each drug but I feel that there is less from the Herceptin. The side effects with me last about a week and a half after treatment and gradually get better. I have ended up having a few blood transfusions because my red blood cells have dropped with the chemo. I think this has made me more tired.  My one tip would be tell the Oncologist of every side effect. After the first treatment I wondered if I would be able to cope with another as I have to say I felt really weird and it really affected my thinking, but this turned out to be one of the anti-sickness drugs which was changed. The drugs I got during or after the first treatment were steroids, two types of anti-sicknes(which need to be taken as preventative), lactulose (for constipation - a side effect of some of the drugs!) Gaviscon to stop burning feeling in throat, co-drydamol for bone ache and sleeping tablets as I was getting exhausted (a mixed blessing as now when I don't take them I wake up all night) and a tablet to coat the stomach before tablets. I hope it all goes well and that you don't get many side effects - not everyone does! Best wishes, Anna",
