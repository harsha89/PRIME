      "Content": "I think that's the biggest issue at the moment... you are on the other side of your treatment and are looking forward to many years ahead of you, and for that, I am incredibly happy for you. You deserve that and you are a strong person to get through it all. The issue for me and my parents is that we still have all the uncertainty at the moment. you sound like my Mum... doesn't want to know or talk about it - just get it sorted. Totally agree with your Dr Google comment - I learned that from years of suffering from Health Anxiety (and, yes... most innocent searches normally have the word \"cancer\" in them; headache - cancer or brain tumour, pain in side - liver cancer, pain in top of stomach - pancreatic cancer... it's silly really). That is why I came here. I've also asked to speak to a nurse via the phone number to get some information. I assume I cannot ask for the path report myself - this is something my Mum would have to do. Like I say - she may not want to ask but I can at least advise her that it is an option.",

      "Content": "No, I don't have power of attorney. My Mum has mentioned that she would like me to have it as they didn't with my Grandad and they had many problems when he succumbed to dementia. It is hard. Even more so as we have just moved to Cornwall and they are in E Sussex. I can't just nip down. It takes around 6 hours in Friday afternoon traffic. We have also totally renovated the house and are still working on it. PLUS I have started a new job and the learning curve is high (I tend to Study at home most nights). And, my Mum doesn't want our boys to know so we have to keep it relatively quiet around the house. I know all these things pale into insignificance when I think of what my Mum is going through. It still is extra pressure though. I will mention it in passing to my parents and see what they say.",

      "Content": "I'm doing OK, Karen. The weight has been lifted a little with that news. It has been quite a stressful time, with my job, the house/move/renovations and with my Mum dealing with all of this so it has been a very heavy few months. Hopefully, the chemo will go well and that will be one thing less to fret about! I'm hoping to get my parents down in between chemo for a break but I need to gauge how my Mum is feeling. I assume the more chemo sessions you have, the worse you feel in between treatments? Or does it not work like that? I think that's how my Mum and Dad view it.",

      "Content": "Hello all, My Mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy and lymph nodes removed a couple of weeks ago. She heard the results of the tests on the lump and lymph nodes yesterday. So, the lump is 1 inch in size, which is 1/2 inch bigger than they thought. They also said she is grade 3 and not grade 2 as they first thought. They advised that the removal of the breast did catch all of the cancer in the breast. They also advised that they found more cancer cells in the lymph nodes than they would like to find so they want to do another CT scan and a bone scan. My Mum doesn't really want to talk about it too much and my Dad is a little defensive when I ask about stages and grades. He insists it is a Grade and not a Stage, but surely you have to be at a certain stage before being graded? I guess my questions are... 1. My Mum is Grade 3, but what STAGE is she? Is it Stage 1 grade 3 or Stage 3 grade 3? I don't know, but I don't want to push my parents as they are going through a tough time at the moment. 2. What is the reasoning for having another CT scan when she has already had one before the mastectomy and that came back clear? 3. What is the bone scan for? My mum is particularly worried about that in case the cancer has entered her bones. Apologies for the questions but i'm not sure who to ask or whether my questions are pointless, pertinent or appropriate!",

And Rosie... yes, I know he will be defensive, and I completely understand. Thank you for the information on the pathology report. However, I live 5 hours away so can't go in there. My Mum and Dad have agreed they don't want to do any information searching on the internet so i'm not sure how receptive they will be to asking for the pathology report. I can but ask.",

Histology showed thatshe had a 32mm grade 3 invasive ductal cancer with no vascular invasion and clear margins, but 8 of 9 lymph nodesbeing involved including the apical node. The cancer is oestrogen-receptor positive , HER-2 negative on immunostaining. Is anyone expert enough to know what that means?",

      "Content": "Wonderful words, Kerry. They have all been taken on board. As have everyone else's comments. You are all a wonderful, helpful bunch of people! I will do everything I can to support my Mum. She doesn't want to do any internet \"Dr Google\" searching so I am doing it and trying to find out as much information as I can (through official sources, like here). I can be very pessimistic but sometimes that holds me in good stead - If you expect the worst and it doesn't come, it's a bonus. Expect the worst and it comes... well, you expected and prepared it!! However, your comment \"No-one is dead, until they are\" really rings. Live life until you can't. I like that!",

      "Content": "Thank you Kacang and triumph. I hope you keep going strong for many years Triumph. I did speak to a nurse at MacMillan last night and he explained a few things. One of which was that it sounded like they were treating my Mum's cancer as a Stage 3A cancer, mostly to err on the side of caution. He also suggested that the bone scan could be a bone DENSITY scan, as some therapies (hormones) can affect the bones. He asked what type of cancer she was diagnosed with and I was surprised not to be able to tell him. I don't know what type it is! My parents haven't told me and i'm not sure they know themselves. It was good to talk with someone who knows the procedures; it's been good to talk to people from both sides of the story. You have all been very helpful. You are right Toxophilite about the ones watching sometime having a hard time - we had a friend who was diagnosed with Terminal cancer caused my a mole that the doctors told her would \"never become cancerous\". She got secondary cancer of the liver, spine and brain and died just under two years after first going to see that doctor. As we were all in tears when she told us, she was so calm. \"At least I know what i'm up against now\", she said. She took it much better than we did! So I know what you mean. I think it is hard on both sides. It was good to talk about it without fear of upsetting my parents though.",

      "Content": "Hi All, Thought i would update you all on what is happening. Firstly, my Mum's scar is healing very well indeed. The nurses are very impressed. They ran more tests on the removed lymph nodes, gave her another CT scan and a bone scan. The are absolutely sure that there is no cancer anywhere else. She started her chemo on the Monday just gone and it went well. Lots of red and clear liquids injected and she coped with it very well. She didn't feel bad when i spoke to her that evening. Her skin felt a bit red and itchy but no adverse effects. She has to have chemo once every three weeks for 6 sessions.  So, things are looking up and she is coping with it graciously",
