Your aunt has only one breast and your uncle still loves her - they are both in their 70s and I'm not and I'm single. Another from my mum I like your hair like that, it suits you! Funny that, I have no choice, amazing what chemo does to your hair, like makes it fall out! Yet another faux Pas from my mum. You look better today, you've lost that sweaty, grey look. Thanks, I feel blessed - and that was from my pharmacist!!! You can eat what you want now, it doesn't matter anymore!! Ok I'll just give up now shall I? My best friend!!! I thought you were better now, why are you still taking tablets?? Durrrr! From my brother More surgery? Why? What are they going to do now?? Fix my breasts for fun!?! What d'you think?? Another from my brother So, to sum it up close friends and family are the worst for saying the wrong things. I guess they mean well. Shame it doesn't make me feel any better though! Good luck on your quest to raise awareness through humour. ",

      "Content": "Morning All, Having just read through the various posts on nails I wanted to put a suggestion forward: Ask your GP for Diprobase Cream (Emollient) and smother your hands and feet in it then cover with soft cotton gloves (for your hands) and soft cotton socks (for your feet). This may not prevent your nails coming off but it will make them feel much better.  I finished my chemo end of Sept 2015 and am on herceptin and pertuzumab intravenously every 3 weeks and have used the emollient regularly.  My nails are ridged and I have been wearing nail varnish - the darker colours help prevent the sun getting to the nails and the actual varnish is meant to give the nails a protective layer ie keeping them stronger. My finger nails started to go white during the chemo and started to peel off only recently, this has happened from half way down the nail so quite painful but the cream helps and I haven't had any infections. My toe nails have lifted and look awful but feel ok. It's worth a go - haven't we been through enough! Can't give up on the nails. ",

      "Content": "Julesdw DDoes anyone have any info about flushes. I'm really struggling with my personal life and work. Iv had acupuncture and I'm on citalipram and clonidine nothing is working I'm exhausted. Julie You mention that you've had acupuncture. Are you still having it? My consultant at the hospital has said that I might need acupuncture for a couple of years to manage the bone pain and hot flushes. It definitely makes a difference for me.  It doesn't stop the flushes, however it does reduce the intensity. i also have 2 small needles similar to drawing pins that I place on the pressure points on my lower leg. They are called pyonex press needles. I wear them for about 2 weeks at a time and then change them. I massage them 3 times a day. But not after 6pm as they stimulate the nerves. They send signals to the brain. I would suggest that you speak to your team about them. I also do my own acupuncture. Something I never thought I would be able to do as I am needle phobic. The hospital showed me how to put the needles in and what to do etc.  If you want to ask me any questions about it please feel free. PM me if you'd rather. Sidney",

      "Content": "Hi Isingbass, I am 18 days post surgery. I have had a single mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  There is quite a lot of breast and ovarian cancer in my family however there was no mutation in the BRCA gene when I was tested so no need for a double mastectomy. It is a hard decision to make. I had chemo first to shrink my tumours and it did shrink them. I had 3 in 1 breast, the largest being 7cms. My surgeon said he didn't want to take out the healthy breast and quite frankly I agreed with him. I know I will still have to be tested regularly but you know that's ok with me.  I am happy to send you photos of my new breast. I have not had any bandaging or dressings with mine so you'll be able to see it how it is. Just pm me. My decision for immediate reconstruction was based on the fact that I did not want to wake up and have nothing there! Simple as that. I will be having a reduction on the right breast with an implant when the time is right. My new breast was given an animal skin 'hammock' for the implant to sit in - apparently this gives the breast more of a natural droop. I had a skin sparing mastectomy and lost my nipple too. The scar is right across my breast horizontally and about 3 inches in width. I have discussed about having a nipple made and am open minded about it. It's early days for me. I'm still getting over the surgery plus I was ill so ended up in hospital shortly after I was discharged. I am glad I was too slim to have my body fat used. I think that is so more invasive and creates its own issues. I had great tits too - and I think I will again by the time the plastic surgeon has finished with me. I hope that helps. PM me any time and ask me anything. I will try to help as much as I can. It's not as bad as it sounds. It's like child birth I guess - you soon forget about the pain - at least that is what I am hoping for ....... Sydneyx",
