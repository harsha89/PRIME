      "Content": "Hello I was diagnosed with lobular cancer ER+ In my left breast in February last year. I was never given any doubt that I had cancer from my first appointment. I had an inverted nipple with nothing showing on my mammogram. Wondering what the MRI will find is worrying. There is plenty of time to think about it as the machine whirs. In my case it found 2 other areas of concern, so there were no arguments, it was a mastectomy.  The results after the operation showed that these extras were not cancer, and luckily nodes were ok. So l made a quick recovery- worked at those exercises and accepted the offer of Pilates and I am now on Letrozole for 10 years, so they must be thinking  that I could reach 82! So all the best for the operation. Your mind will be more settled, although life is not quite the same. X",

Are they having to consult with someone? They don\u2019t know how to tell me.  One week later l left the hospital with a packet of Letrozole and no further treatment. I have just waited 3 weeks for first year mammogram results. You\u2019d think we wouid know what to expect bot this worrying keeps coming back. Best Wishes for your results. ",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy on March 23. The physio thought my seroma might need draining but the breast nurse said it looked normal for 3 weeks after surgery and then said it would go but could take a few months. At least I know! Just one small patch is sore , it looks like a minature volcano . My scar has also healed well, so we are all in the same boat ( floating in fluid) !Sorry !",

Then I moved on to knitted knockers and crochet.  Luckily these distractions keep us sane and off the wine. ! Very impressed with everyone\u2019s efforts and will add my pram blanket and toy. l am a Woolwarehouse fan too. Love those bags they send the yarn in. l am waiting for knee replacements so plenty of knitting this year too. xx",

I have taken to wearing patterned tops and round necked t shirts. I m a B/C cup so  that makes no difference . Tried  more expensive bra it helped keep me in shape but made node biopsy site sore. Anyone got a solution?",
