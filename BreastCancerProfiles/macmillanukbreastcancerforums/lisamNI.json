      "Content": "hey huni, you are defo not alone, i am same as you 3yr old and almost 1yr old... its not easy!! im only half way through my 1st session.. i am pretty lucky tho, i had childcare in place for me going back to work three days per week following my maternity... was back to work 1 day b4 diagnosis, ironic lol. so my chemo is on the wed and the kids are with my lovely neighbour/childminder wed thurs and fri. keeps them in good routine, i feel guilty as sin, but i would prob b like that if i was back at work anyway!! we can't win.. and are so hard on ourselves, but that is the joys of motherhood i guess. same as you my hubby is great, he really is trying, but they cant b with us all the time and they just dont do things the way you would!! my 3 yr old was in a great routine in his own bed every night at 7.30 but since my surgery/chemo it has all gone to pot. he is now in bed every night with my hubby and i am in the spare room (partly because after masectomy and node clearance was so scared of him jumping ontop of me in the middle of the night) and its now 10 b4 the wee rascal is in bed. but you know what i am so glad i have them both, if i didn't i think the security blanket aka bed wouldn't be got out of. i find it really hard to accept help, but right now i feel like i am coping ok. sickness only seemed to last 5days, still having headaches and quite tired. do you feel that it is the same second session or is it worse?

      "Content": "claire i also found that very helpful, still have to pay for childcare and my pay is going to zero in feb.. Jessterdy, its good to get it out!! it sounds like you are having a tough time, i can only imagin how hard it is for you.. Mandy, i am itching to get back to work but i work an hr away and it would just kill me doing that! so tired all time so just taking off!! i met with citizens advise the other day and they made me apply for DLA and try for ESA when my pay stops... also if earning change you may be entitled to tax credits or more tax credits which ever is appropriate. if you get tax credits they also help out apparently with child care costs, worth looking into..

      "Content": "Hey ladies, im 28 mum of two young in's and had my surgery(lft masectomy and node clearance) b4 chemo.. it was tough, but i had a section with both my kids and i felt it was wee buns compared to it... at least you can walk about after, you have movement in your arm but it is restricted... it was id say about week 4 b4 i felt comfortable on my own holding the baby. at 10mths she was wriggly and kept headbuttin my wound!! any favours you can call in for help, do so!! you will need all the hands you can get.. Sue only reason i am delaying my reconstruction is because i didn't want to delay the chemo in any way and bein post pregnancy my normal shape had not come back yet... im glad now i waited as my wound heeled great and chemo wasn't delayed, but everyone is different, my cousin had both done at the same time and it is an amazing job!! listen to your consultant, they will be best to advise on ur own personal circumstances!! im on chemo no 2 now, keep strong ladies, its amazing what the kids can get us through!! thinking of you all Lisa x",

      "Content": "hey Jules, just read your post, im only 6 wks on and have found a massive improvement... i think this has been my hardest time in limbo between surgery and chemo. it is so hard when you are such an upbet and possitive person to always be so possitive when something so negitive is happening to us.. your only human hun and if you need a cry get it out. and if you need a wee bit of extra medical help to tide you over there is no shame in it.. you are not alone!! I don't know about you but my brain goes into overdrive... a few weeks ago i actually read some of the stuff i got from bc nurse because i was so parinoid about i wee cut i got and i came accross i local cancer centre to me in some leaflets i gave them a call and am now have been offered some free reflexology/ counselling etc which is great.. you should check is there anything like this near you... might really help!! another thing that helped has been getting my prosthesis yesterday it is a bit weird but looks so real when you have clothes on.. thinking about you, and hope you feel better soon..

      "Content": "Hey lucy, Well done chic you did it!! some lovely little in will benefit from your generosity, good on ya!! no idea when test is will ask when i am in for chemo on wed.. The only bit of practical advice i can give you for op is make sure you get urself a masectomy bra or non wire bra even a good sports bra just make sure it is good and high at the front, just so its a bit easier when breast care nurse gives you soft prosthesis (pin cushen)it doesnt pop out and its a wee bit more bareable leavin the hospital looking normal. also advisable to get loose fitting pj tops or even button up ones because your arm is quite restricted after. After the op it was not as had as i origionally thought looking down, it didn't really hit me till i got home and looked in the mirror for the first... defo had a wee moment then (we r only human lol) but you dust yourself off and get on.. Funny thing was shavin, i hate having hairly arm pits so invest in electric shaver. i also got some aluminium free deoderant from health shop cos i couldn't stand the thought of bo.. Its 6weeks tomorrow from my op. e45 helps, pysio helps... movement is getting there slowly but surely and strength is getting there to... cant wait to jump in the car for wee sail tomorrow cos my insurance company wouldn't insure me til 6 wks after op :-( I wont lie and say it dosen't hurt cos it does. and i wont say that drains aren't a pain in the back side cos they are but you will get there... just be sensible and keep ontop of the pain relief and dont be afraid to ask for them and sleeping tablets.. what ever you need to get you through this!! Another thing that helped was my mum treated me to wee massage day or so b4 had. treat yourself and give yourself something to look forward to... enjoy your christmas, Lisa xox",
