I suppose the main worry is that if something so small can cause high grade secondaries, how fierce is it! Though suppose the chemo will hopefully knock it on the head. Hears hoping! Thanks again Love to you all Susan",

      "Content": "Hi All, I am new and have just been diagnosed with a primary cancer with secondary Lypmph Node met. They are unable to find the primary but suspect it is in the breast. All tests are negative. That is very hard to deal with for me and I know that they would be happier if it was found. However, I started Chemo yesterday (FEC) and will have all axillary glands removed when they have shrunk. Has anyone else out there had the same situation? Would love to hear from you or indeed anyone! Got side effects from the Chemo within 4 hours ie aching muscles, nausea, heartburn, tiredness and metalic taste. Is that usual so soon? Better today though. Look forward to hearing from you.",
