    "Content": "Hi All, I also started a blog when I was going through treatment and,now i'm one year on, I'm so glad I kept a record of what I went through, There were so many funny moments along the way and I've tried to write with honesty and humour and hope others find some comfort in it, It has also re-ignited a passion for writing and inspired me to get out of my mundane job and do something I love! My blog can be found atÂ https://lumpymummy.wordpress.com/ As Tamoxifen is affecting my memory it is also something I will show my kids when they are old enough so they will always know how hard i fought to stay with them. Best Wishes x",
