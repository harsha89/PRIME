I would of thought you would be offered 'radiotherapy' and 'hormone therapy'. This site is amazing, with a wealth of help, information and advice - I am sure others with far more knowledge than me will be along soon xxx ",

The Consultant had said how happy he was, how pleased he'd got good clear margins, negative lymph node.  Then around 9.00pm last night I looked at my pathology report and well - I went into shock and worry (typical to do this at this time of night to) so for the next few hours I tried to 'google' it - came up with nothing, well nothing helpful. Then thought, I going to ask the girls and guys on the forum....... Thank Goodness for Toxophilite firing arrows at you - and Thank You so much Dreamthief for your help and knowledge - sorry we were the course of your 'dreamthiefs' last night/early this morning. My mind is more at ease now, I have printed out the description/explanation. Wow what a read, thank you. Breakfast.... I slept though this and lunch in the mind set 'while I'm asleep, all is good in my world'. Again 'Thank You Girls'. xxxx I've tried to add tags in hope this can help others on here",

I just have no interest in driving at all.   I've got one of the balloons in my tummy too - this was there 'before' Letrozole.

Dreamthief, I hope you don't mind me adding this to your post, I recently heard this on the news and I, like all of the other Fruit Loops truly value your knowledge. This post relates to Heceptin, I know there are ladies having or waiting to start this treatment - I've just found the link on the BBC News website I will add this at the end. This to relate's to savings and cut backs, excuse how I type this as I can't remember it fully.   I believe NICE have recommended the NHS use a cheaper alternative to Herceptin for BC patents from October 2018. I understand that the alternative will be as good so there is nothing to worry about.  The trouble is, these sort of changes can come as real shocks for patients, at least if patients know about this, they have knowledge and knowledge is power (or something like that  On the plus side, \"maybe\" the NHS will be as slow to recommend the alternative as they are in recommending the (limited) approved treatment (January 2018) of the combined operation of Lumpectomy and combined IORT Radiotherapy treatment.  BBC News article on Heceptin... https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45003912 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NICE Lumpectomy with combined Radiotherapy given \"Limited Approval\" TARGIT IORT Intra-operative Radiotherapy: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta501/chapter/1-Recommendations  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Owww if only they could walk in our shoes.

'everything will work out: You're doing amazing: We will get though this: You are not alone', etc.  I think we become so good at hiding how we really feel, we start to loose ourselves then when this comes along we are no long fully able to 'put the front' - I know with all this, I have suddenly developed a right temper, a temper than has been hidden away for many years.  In a way, I'm glad it is coming out - laughing, just wished I could control it a bit more.

I will be truthful, when I was leaving, I did feel a little unsure; this was down to myself thinking 'I would be needing some kind of treatment'. This said, I would have no hesitation in making contact should I have any concerns. If we don't feel comfortable with the people caring for us, I personally think this has a knock on effect both treatment wise and mentally.   You could always book and see how you get on.

I would have out of no where a type of very, very small amount of mucus/phlegm that would just come to the back of my throat - however, no matter how hard I tried I could hardly ever manage to 'cough it up' and on the odd times I did, it was clear, but, very, very sticky (thick to I suppose). 5 weeks or so on and I am still getting it, also, find I get it more when I go to speak it sort of stops me from speaking (could be a good thing), it stops me speaking till I clear my throat with a little cough type of thing (I don't know how to spell what I'd like to say).  I have noticed that one of the side effects can be 'dryness of mucous membranes' - well if they are drying up, I suppose it would make the mucous thicker.

You did the best thing by going as soon as you notice the lump and now the wheels are in motion.

Please stop worrying, please, it really won't help you, it will just drain you and make you feel worse.  I am sorry I can't answer about the BRCA2 gene type of BC, however there are lots of ladies on here that will be able to give you advice.  What I can say, is 'it is 'not' it for you!!!  Worse case scenario, if it is anything untoward, so, so much can be done, so much has changed in recent years, treatments are improving all the time. I would say, as hard as this is, put it out of your mind as best as you can until you go to the Breast Clinic, before you start thinking all the things that I know you are, wait until you actually know something, it really might be nothing, the time of the month tenderness, a cyst, so many different reasons.  You are the same person you was last week, yesterday, today and tomorrow and next week, please don't drive yourself mad worrying. You have done something about this which is good, you have gone to your doctors, you will see the breast clinic team, you have joined this group, so until your appointment try hard to put it out of your mind.  You could try some meditation or mindfulness - there are a lot of apps that are good, these will help you, especially the sleep ones.  I found them really helpful, any time I started to get myself worked up I would listen to one of them and I will say they did help. Please keep posting on here, ask any questions you want to, we are a friendly bunch.  I am sure others will be along to guide you.   With Love and Hugs xx",

We are all in this together and I believe the more we know and are clear about the better it is for all of us.... Hello Feb59, I am glad I found your post. I had this very discussion with a friend today, she is past menopause and was prescribed tamoxifen due to slight thinning of bones, apparently tamoxifen can help with this (maybe we have found one advantage for it?). Anyway, she does not know what to do about taking the Tamoxifen, I asked the reason why..... She is of the belief Tamoxifen and Letrozole are prescribed with the view of preventing a 'reoccurrence' of Breast Cancer, only breast cancer not any others. (me reply, thats's brilliant for starters then).   She added that when she asked her GP about side effects of Tamoxifen 'causing' uterus cancer' the GP tried to pass this off quickly and when pushed the GP did say that it can cause this.   I don't know percentages - what it did open my eyes to, was I thought (my own doing I suppose in the mixed up mind of my mind) I thought I was taking Letrozole to prevent both 'reoccurrence and secondaries' - I was told it is to prevent reoccurrence, but this mind of mine took that to mean secondaries too. So, I understand its to stop reoccurrence - but could it cause secondaries ie uterus cancer? Has anyone heard if Letrozole can cause/trigger Uterus cancer?  My minefield is getting more mines added to it arrgghhh  I think it is good we can come on hear and be able to discuss all of this kind of information and share knowledge, it helps us all xxxxx (Hoping my post makes sense, feel like I've waffled). xxx",

The biggest problem when we think about it is 'we seem damed with if don't and possibly damed if we do'.   I'm 18 months on Letrozole, I do a few side effects, mild thankfully - my biggest one has been 'trigger thumbs', which thankfully seem to be calming down and movement returning albeit very, very slowly.  You are so right this Group is full of wonderful 'Fruit Loops' all willing to help, share advice, tips, ideas, etc. xxxx",

We are all in this together and I believe the more we know and are clear about the better it is for all of us.... Hello Feb59, I am glad I found your post. I had this very discussion with a friend today, she is past menopause and was prescribed tamoxifen due to slight thinning of bones, apparently tamoxifen can help with this (maybe we have found one advantage for it?). Anyway, she does not know what to do about taking the Tamoxifen, I asked the reason why..... She is of the belief Tamoxifen and Letrozole are prescribed with the view of preventing a 'reoccurrence' of Breast Cancer, only breast cancer not any others. (me reply, thats's brilliant for starters then).   She added that when she asked her GP about side effects of Tamoxifen 'causing' uterus cancer' the GP tried to pass this off quickly and when pushed the GP did say that it can cause this.   I don't know percentages - what it did open my eyes to, was I thought (my own doing I suppose in the mixed up mind of my mind) I thought I was taking Letrozole to prevent both 'reoccurrence and secondaries' - I was told it is to prevent reoccurrence, but this mind of mine took that to mean secondaries too. So, I understand its to stop reoccurrence - but could it cause secondaries ie uterus cancer? Has anyone heard if Letrozole can cause/trigger Uterus cancer?  My minefield is getting more mines added to it arrgghhh  I think it is good we can come on hear and be able to discuss all of this kind of information and share knowledge, it helps us all xxxxx (Hoping my post makes sense, feel like I've waffled). xxx",

I am so sorry you have had to experience this, I have tried no end to get the word out there for this amazing treatment.  It is so unfair and so cruel to allow us people going through this to be denied approved treatment, treatment that could be all over and done with in one operation (subject to clear margins, etc - this is the same with all operations).  To avoid weeks of daily radiotherapy - and all because there are issues with who's faces get put out so to speak!!! Firstly, it is fantastic that you have had the courage and foresight to ask for this treatment and that you would be prepared to travel for this treatment, yet it is still not available to you!!!! This only goes to reiterate and confirm we are being denied such an amazing treatment!!!  Moving forward, in answer to your questions... I too found out about Targit IORT (Inter-operative radiotherapy treatment) #Targit #IORT from doing my own research. From my initial contact late on a Thursday afternoon, the coming Monday I was on a train travelling to have various tests etc. Returning for further tests on the Thursday, staying overnight to have my operation (Lumpectomy and Radiotherapy) on the Friday.  Saturday lunchtime I was travelling home. Follow up appointments, etc are as you say 'pay as you go'. Time from contact to surgery was just over a week.  I hope this helps, please feel free to message me if you need any more information.

I have accepted your friends request, you can send private messages via the email/envelope button towards the top right of the page, near the 'log in' area. Once the operation is done you have follow up's appointments, these are 'pay as you go' as you say.   Hormone treatment, Letrozole is prescribed on the NHS via your doctor, normally on a monthly repeat prescription. In case you aren't made aware of this, all your prescriptions will be free of charge from the NHS for the next 5 years (I think it is 5 years). Depending how urgent urgent is, I would imagine you would go straight to A&E.  Saying this, I can't see what could happen that is urgent as such, if there was anything urgent causing you concern you would phone the PA/Secretary or BC Nurse and they would talk you through this and arrange for you to see Consultant if need be.   I really hope it is the same surgeon I am with, he is wonderful, truly a wonderful, kind, caring man - Please give him my best regards. If you need any other advice or need to talk please message me. Don't panic - one step at a time - You can do this. Gail, xx   ",

This view whilst walking will certainly get you 'walking back to happiness'. I have gone out three times this week.  It took me forever to get myself up off the settee, so nearly didn't do it.  Just before I go out I set my phone alarm for 15 minutes (then thought oww 15 mins there (not sure yet) and 15 mins back - this will be 'half an hour' am I ready for this.  So, I goe out and walk through the side walkway leading towards a long road with houses on (I've walked this maybe 4 times in my entire time of living around here, its just somewhere you don't walk unless you live on the road, you always tend to drive down this road). So, I considered this (silly or not I don't feel safe out alone - when I've said this to other half in the past, he jokes (hmmm) look in the mirror, you'll be safe :o  ) Hence why my walks are 'secret' at the moment and if/when I build up some stamina along with loose some weight I will then share! For now, this is the start of 'my time'. Anyway how bad is this, I'm walking away at a steady pace, and there is an 'elder' man, got to be in his late 70's walking ahead of me... with a limp using a walking stick.  Now then, I say to myself as I'm walking along, come on then lets chat him up, well I'm now getting out of puff and he seems to be just 'dawdling along' - I'm now hot and thinking I need to stop - I keep going and then my 15 minute alarm goes off (I have two thoughts, wow I've got this far in 15 minutes and I'm also realising just how out of condition I am (I am overweight - never wanted to be - it 'just happened' :))  I resent my alarm for a further 15 minutes, then carry on walking, I get to the end of the road, the gentleman crosses over the road and I turn left and enter onto the field which is on my way back home. I see this healthy looking young girl and I could just tell then when she gets onto the cycle/walking path she is going to start jogging - and she did.  I carried on walking and I began to notice that I was feeling 'better/fresher/awake than when I was in the house.  Next thing, I am heading off the field, the young girl is on her way back and I am now nearly home.  I get into my house and then..... off goes my 15 minute phone alarm. I have walked for 'Half an Hour' and I'm now back home, feeling secretly pleased with myself :)) I hope I can just keep getting 'out' there - I know it won't always be half an hour, even if I can do 10 minutes - I will be pleased.... my body deserves at least 10 minutes and I am the only one that can give it this - and in return, I am sure my body will be grateful Nighty Night xxx",

You'll never believe me when I tell you this, its so true though and I have to copy and paste this to the Fatigue thread. So, I finally dragged myself off the settee, got changed and set off - outside the house I set my phone alarm for 10 minutes!!! - I thought I'd do 10 minutes 'there' and 10 minutes 'back' = 20 minutes (which would be 5 minutes longer than Monday). Off I go, brrrr it is chilly, lets walk a little faster, lets slow down - hmm, I seem to be further than Monday, lets walk a little more - (brain fog now, what time would my alarm be going off - have I missed it in my pocket).  Okay, lets turn round, walking away .... \"ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling - okay its not the sound of my alarm but my alarm is going off.  Right, I'm setting it again for another 10 minutes and lets see where I'll be when it goes off.  Walking, walking, through the back gate, into the house, changing out of trousers that I have dedicated to walking (they are grey, I only ever where black - so most won't recognise me from afar) - folding said trousers, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling - its the alarm. Now what I do have to say is, I truthfully, can't believe how much I did in '20 minutes!!!!!! 20 minutes!!! my perception of time whilst I'm in the house is so different.  Now then, since coming back in the house I have washed up (some from last night - no energy or inclination). wrote on a few threads (this is time consuming for me, due to bad spelling and slow computer).  Made a cup of tea and just about to feed the cats.  This is why I need to post on the Fatigue thread - it has given me 'some energy - not sure how much or for how long - but I do feel a little brighter for the fresh air and movement :))  Sorry to waffle - this should be my name Waffle haha xxx  Right so a good few hours later I have finally got online and a line haha and eventually got my photo to insert. Energy is still better than it normally would be - I'm just sitting with mrsox watching Eastenders :o (joke) xxxx",

You know when I first mentioned on the \"Fatigued Thread\" about us starting a \"Walking Thread\", I had thought, well there are 'walking groups' to inspire people - I wonder if a Walking Thread would work for us, I certainly would like and am in need of encouragement. When I was writing about it I was thinking to myself 'everyone is going to think I'm you mad' (okay confirm that I'm mad).  How wrong was I - I can't believe how many ladies have said how it is inspiring them. Then with the fantastic names that you and PennyL came up with, it just had to be.  This just goes to 'show/prove' - 'we are normal with the thoughts' what we go through, the various feelings we have, what we feel etc.   Whats even nicer, is our truthfulness, the shear honesty of how we feel, how are day is and the inspiration this thread is giving all of us.   Owww Happybird - Your post was lovely and your photograph for me 'honestly made me cry - don't panic, happy tears, my eyes are filling again typing this.  Firstly, how very, very kind and thoughtful to dedicate such a beautiful photograph to me.  If you don't mind, please can I copy it and use it as my screen background on my computer - it is such an inspirational photograph 'Thank You' again. I didn't know about the Polar Bear on the Isle of Wight - I can see him and how amazing he looks too. As a child we would go on holiday to the Isle of Wight, Bournemouth and in later years Eastbourne - a few memories from Bournemouth was a very long sloping road down to the beach and the other was a 'life' on the front of a cliff (I would of said mountain as a child haha).  Then Eastbourne we would go on the pier and watch a man making seagulls and other animals out of glass, we used to watch him actually glass blowing, then there was the bandstand and near there was a lady that 'lived' on the beach, the story we were told, was her husband was killed at sea (may of been during the war) she wouldn't accept this and was waiting for him to return (I was only about 8 or 9 at the time so didn't really understand how sad this was at the time).  Thank you for such a kind a lovely gesture - this photo shows us all what we have to look forward to, what is out there and it's free - with the feeling of the wind :) the smell of the sea or countryside and the wonderful views - they are there for us, like you say, if we just open up our minds to it - its a goal for us to work towards. Hello PennyL - your photo is lovely, I wonder what the story is to this house? Does the sea ever surround it - wow, imagine living there.  The sound of the sea would be something else and imagine the sea spray on a really stormy and windy night wowwww.   Well Done to you and your hubby for having your first walk on the beach - I don't know between you and Happybird your both making me quiet envious - Birmingham just hasn't got the same scenery (you'll see this with a photo that I'll post in a day or two - I'm getting a complex with how long this post is :o  ronstar - so love the photographs and they inspiration you are giving us.  I've wrote down your stats (hey I'm sound more fit already, with the stats hehehe).  I don't think I'll be doing the run 5 mins for some time, however, it has given us guidance of things we can do and tweak to build up stamina etc.  Mine will more than likely start with Walk - maybe a little faster walk for 30 secs (that is a lot when your walking, it is) then back to normal, then faster again etc - I know they walking fast is very good for you - like you say, one step at a time - doing what we feel comfortable with. Hi Violetsniff - Massive \"Well Done\" on the 9 months!!!!! wow, I do hope with everyones inspiration we can all keep going.  I'll be the first to admit how out of breath, shape and condition I am in - this as got to change (owww I think I've heard myself say this before many times over the years).  Cannon, you say you don't get breathless now - have you noticed any other changes within yourself? Now then a little confession, (not sure if I've mentioned this three or four times before haha) I came down with the 'lurgy - flu' on the 1st January ~ New Years Day..... I have only once felt as poorly, this about 2 years back, on Christmas Day that time, that only knocked me about for a few weeks though. After that I have been a little OCD with hand sanitiser, swopping queues (didn't realise it was spelt like this)  in the shop because (wait for this)... I can tell if the assistant has a cold just by looking at their nose!!! :o (My Mom goes mad, when I said lets move the person has a cold and Mom been Mom then goes up to the said person and asks... 9 times out of 10 I'm right hahaha).  So, with my hand sanitiser and my new skill of 'nose reading' ;) I had 'not had a cold or sniffle for just over ONE YEAR!! then I came down with this.  Well here comes my confession, up until this Walking Thread (well it is in the Fatigue Thread - I'll have to copy my post and picture onto here), up until then, I had not been 'outside' my house (I have nipped in and out the back garden), I mean actually 'outside' the boundary of our house since New Years Day - mainly do to feeling really poorly, as I have felt better I still don't want to drive yet (its coming back slowly). I've done shopping online and anything else I've got my other half to do.   Now you can see how the walking thread became an idea - I wanted to get out, just no motivation, stamina or interest..... Until you lovely ladies all started posting and it honestly pushed me - okay, so my first walk was 10 minutes there and 10 minutes back - but I DID IT - the first time since 'New Year' ..... Thank You Ladies, Thank You LeoLady58 putting the Walking Thread together - Honeslty YOU ARE ALL AMAZING - and I really do need to post on the Fatigue Thread to let everyone know the benefits I felt since my first walk on Monday. I am going, but feel I need to add, it is a massive effort to go out at the moment, when I have got out, after about 10 minutes I can feel my brain start to 'open up' and feel fresher - I can feel it when I get back in the house, as LeoLady58 said, I can feel 'the inner me waking up 'a little' and this is one I am trying to take in and remember 'out of 24 hours in the day - surely I can give my brain and my body 20 minutes - I keep saying its not for me - its for my brain and my body its gone though a lot so I am helping it :) I'm stopping ladies, WAKE UP - mind you with the time..... GO TO SLEEP ~  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hello,  I want to share this with you all. You may or may not know, when I had my lumpectomy operation, I had the combined Radiotherapy treatment at the same time.  It is called \"TARGIT IROT\" (Intra-operative RadioTherapy).  By having this type of operation and combined radiotherapy treatment, that was it, my treatment was over, all done,  all within the one operation (in addition I do have daily Letrozole tablets). This type of treatment is suitable for, I believe, a single lump - lumpectomy, requiring radiotherapy treatment. If everything worked out, I was able to do away with having daily radiotherapy treatment over the course of 3 to 4 weeks! I was blessed, my treatment was done.  I did not have to have daily radiotherapy, the possible side effects of burning to my skin, I didn't have the travel daily, I didn't have the extra stress and worry, I've come back to add this, with this type of treatment you 'can' if needed later on in life still have additional radiotherapy to the same bust too, whereas with the 'daily' radiotherapy you can't have anymore. There are so many benefits.  For the patient the list of benefits go on and on and we as patients are what matters - it's our lives, our time and I suppose its our money that has gone into the NHS, so we should be the ones to benefit from a treatment that 'is' available. This treatment will save the NHS money, time and free up radiotherapy staff and machines for other patients needing radiotherapy treatment, and here is where this wonderful treatment instead of being welcomed, the problems start, and I believe, all from within the NHS -  the Radiotherapy departments saying it will take away their jobs, instead of looking further ahead, that it will free up their skills and machines for other patients that require various different types of radiotherapy. They bring the cost of the machine into question, this machine will save so much time for both the NHS and the patient, save on electric used, save on carbon footprint again, it will save on more than it will cost in the long run, because of this, instead of NICE approving it in full, NICE have given 'Limited Approval' - they are putting hurdles in place for the patient to have to jump over, at a time when we are vulnerable and in an environment that we know nothing about! The sad thing, I believe even now, ladies being diagnosed that would be suitable for this type of treatment, even this week are not told of this is treatment or that the treatment is available, let alone offered it. I find it sad that NICE have limited is approval, one example.....'only using machines that are already available' - these machines are in 'some' NHS Hospitals - so where is the fairness in this, this should be available to all.....  This leads me to wonder, I know at a time like this the patient shouldn't have to be chasing around asking questions, however, this is how it is.  I was thinking could we get a list of all the NHS Hospitals that have these machines and then list them on here.  (i.e. I am 99% certain Royal Free in London has this machine).  Then under the NHS 'Choose and Book' scheme patients at least stand a chance at having this type of treatment. The Recommendations are:-  1.1 The Intrabeam radiotherapy system is not recommended for routine commissioning for adjuvant treatment of early invasive breast cancer during breast-conserving surgical removal of the tumour.  1.2 Use of the Intrabeam radiotherapy system is recommended only using machines that are already available and in conjunction with NHS England specified clinical governance, data collection and submission arrangements.  1.3 The procedure should only be carried out by clinicians with specific training in the use of the Intrabeam radiotherapy system. 1.4 Patient selection for Intrabeam radiotherapy should be done by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of early invasive breast cancer, which includes both breast surgeons and clinical oncologists. 1.5 Clinicians wishing to undertake Intrabeam radiotherapy should take the following actions: Inform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts. Ensure that patients understand the uncertainties about the procedure and inform them about alternative treatment options. Provide patients with NICE's written information on the evidence of the risks and benefits of the range of treatment options available as an aid to shared decision-making. So basically, this wonderful treatment that is available for us, that keeps getting pushed back, has finally being given 'Limited approval' - just to make it that little bit harder for us as patients to receive, at a time when we are already feeling vulnerable. I am passion about getting the word out on this treatment, giving ladies the knowledge that this treatment is out there, that it is available on the NHS - you just have to 'ask' and maybe 'ask again' and then ask where you can have this. I have waited months to see if 'one person on this website' would be writing saying how they have been offered this amazing treatment, unless I've missed it, I don't think anyone has - hence why I've waffled on in this post. If this post helps just one person receive this treatment, I am happy.  With Love to you all xxxx Link to NICE website and page (I hope)....  www.nice.org.uk/.../1-RecommendationsWell, at the time of my operation NICE was reviewing this treatment, finally, in January of this year, NICE has recommended this treatment, sadly with certain 'provisos' Link to University College London website and page (I hope) relating to limited approval: www.ucl.ac.uk/.../nhs-breast-cancer-patients-benefit-from-ucl-pioneered-treatment",

      "Content": "Hi ArgyMargy, I understand these machines are already in various hospitals around the country - so I truly believe the patient should be told about this type of treatment and where it is available.  Even on the bases of 'so patients know about it' and can make up their own minds. The uncertainties with regard to the radiotherapy part of the treatment, I believe could be described as similar to when having a lumpectomy and surgeon getting 'clear' margins.  Thankfully for most all is fine and only one lot of treatment is required (as was in my case). I just think patients should be given the choice.  At the very least at least the question can be asked if a patient is suitable for this type of treatment.  I understand the NHS can't just magic up money to place these machines in every hospital, however, these machines and technology are already sitting in 'some' hospitals in the UK - I just would like Breast Cancer Patients that are suitable to be given the chance to have this type of treatment. I think it is good that we are able to talk about it and raise awareness. Sorry I've waffled on xx This treatment was given 'limited approval' 6 months ago, I wonder how many ladies on here have been either told or offered this type of treatment.  ",

I mean, look at the travelling this operation could of saved you (if you were suitable for the combined), along with so many others.   What makes this worse, I believe Swindon is one of the Hospitals 'with' this machine,  this is why we need to get the word out there. I will at some point try to find out which hospitals have this machine. Currently, I believe the Hospitals with this machine, are:- Royal Free, The Whittington, Guy's in London, Winchester, Swindon and Harlow. xxxx",

      "Content": "Hello Anonymouse49,  Thank you for asking, the more that we ask the more the word will be heard.  Well thats a tricky one, being too young versa the treatment, well then, I think age is great to have on your side and it answer the question for both of us. It is interesting about them not currently offering treatment to women over 50 for a number of reasons. This treatment had 'limited approval' back in January of this year, so that's some 6 months and still not being offered. and what is even worse, Swindon was one of the Hospitals I believe trialing this treatment -  They have the machine there with staff qualified to use it!!!   I really don't think this is fair. My hope, any lady that finds herself unfortunately enough to be here, needing treatment for Lumpectomy along with Radiotherapy and is over 50 - will now have this information and can ask if you are suitable for this treatment. If you are under or near to these hospitals:- Royal Free, The Whittington, Guy's in London, Winchester, Swindon and Harlow. Ask if you are suitable for Targit IORT - Plus, the NHS have the 'Choose and Book' service, this allows you to have the option to 'Choose' the Hospital where you would like your treatment. Thank you again Anonymouse49 - we are both wiser from you phone call.",

      "Content": "You are all doing amazing, I have to say no walk for me today, my day didn't to go to plan - I hadn't planned it, it just changed from the start. Along sad story cut short...I had heard via Neighbourhood Watch group on Facebook about a poorly fox on the other side of the field to where I live, I contacted the fox rescue that I have had help from a few years back, I was told they had received any update, the person had called back to say the fox had now ran off into the bushes.  I said to the fox rescue, I've got a feeling about this, my gut instinct is telling me to go and check, I said I would and I'd phone back with an update. So, planning ahead, I take some cat food, cat carrier and drive around the roads to get to the other side of field (first time driving since September - needs must, I could of walked, but if fox is there I'd never of been able to carry all the way back, so I drive).  I get to area and look about I can't see anything - but this is a field with bushes all around.  I look at the photo on Facebook and walk and look and finally I think I'm in right area (I take a photo - I'm exactly there, this was spooky, in the exact place).  I look around, nothing, being honest, I am relieved, how would I catch him, how would I carry him, what will I do, these are all questions now going through me mind.  Then..... I spot a little ball of rusty brown fur!!!! owwwww I've now got all these questions again.  I phone a person I know that has helped with fox rescued a lot but due to health reasons can't drive, they say if I can catch Foxy :o it bring him/her over.  At this, an RSPCA man arrives, he is walking over to me, he is a really nice man and fairly new to the job (I 'had' lost faith in the RSPCA over the year and to be honest this guy did help win me back over - a little).  We both agree fox is in a bad way more than likely hit by a vehicle.  I ask if he catches fox I will take it to rescuer, then to vets for assessment, fluids and treatment - then on to rescue in Northampton for hopeful recovery and return back here when well enough. Fox puts up 'no' struggle going into cat carrier. I phone OH and asked if he'd drive me and foxy to other side of town. (this was my Valentine's present :)) which I am more than happy with). I said I'd keep this short and I'm not.  Got to Vets, gave all details, OH handed cat carrier over to the nurse to take in to room to see the vet, as he did this the fox made this little cry.  Nurse took into vet and came 'straight' out and said I'm sorry I think it has 'just' passed away.  We went and the poor little girl had gone. Her gums were so pale, the vet thinks she was hit by a vehicle and could either have internal injuries, broken leg, or hip, or back any of this plus all the time after this lying around in the cold. Owww my brain wasn't thinking right when all this happened and I'm mad and upset with myself of not taking her to a nearer vet, for not wrapping her up to get her warm - I just didn't think, why I don't know, these are the things that normally come naturally to me, its like I've forgotten what to do and I'm learning all over again - I put a blanket on the floor of the carrier, I should of put extra bedding in with her, should I of let her go with the RSPCA man - so many questions. Its rubbish, you try to help and end up feeling to blame.  So, my friends, this is why I didn't get out and do my walk today. You are all putting me to shame, keep it up, you are all amazing - I will try with every intention tomorrow to get out and walk - sorry to of waffled on.  Nighty Night xxx    Ps.  Happybird I'm on letrozole, minimum side effects - I'll post tomorrow about it zzzzzZZZzzzzz  ",

You read right the 'Fruit Loops are going on Tour' and our lovely Leolady56 is piloting our plane, you'll recognise her wearing biggles goggles and a big scarf and a smile hahaha owww   Well ladies after all you kind comments, plus Leolady out swimming at some time that seems to be off my radar at the moment, I did it, the day was running away with me getting no where, I don't know whats happening, the time is flying by, I can't say I am sitting watching tv - I am doing 'things' of some description, yet nothing seems to be getting done.... accept that is, I did get out for my walk, I went a 'little' extra, which I was pleased about.  Its funny as I'd seen a programme about eating protein and how it helps workouts.  Well on Monday I had 'bacon and egg' for breakfast (okay, okay lunch) and my walk up the hill seems fairly straightforward, it wasn't hard, even after not walking since before Christmas, today was 'ham and cheese' and that same hill seemed a struggle, I did it, but I could tell.  I am pleased I made the effort, thank you again ladies  Thats me then, another late night - sleep well xxxx Other fitness trackers are available.",

If I had Private Health Insurance I would not be staying on a 'waiting list', never knowing 'if' it will happen.  I know in my heart, this treatment is being delayed, withheld, whatever you want to call it due to people 'thinking' (I believe wrongly) they will be out of jobs in the long term, that the radiotherapy part of this treatment is taking so called 'work' away from the Radiotherapy units - in my opinion, it wouldn't do this, it would free up machines to allow for others with different needs for receive treatments sooner.   This treatment is available through a limited number of Hospitals on the NHS - we need to shout out for this treatment to be given, for any ladies coming along - they need to be told about this treatment (I believe a Doctor by law is supposed to tell their patent of 'all' potential treatments available), they need to be offered and given this treatment.   We are in such a vulnerable state when we are first diagnosed we don't want to have to trawl around looking for treatments to have - this should be offered, it is our right.   Betty, I feel confident you should be able to get this operation via. the NHS if you are prepared to travel, if not, then there is something drastically wrong and it needs bring out for all to hear.

      "Content": "Dear Georgia78  This is my concern, we are even made aware of this treatment, let alone getting offered it.  My treatment as such is finished, I could walk away, I can't, I want every person that is suitable for this treatment to be told about it and offer it.  I can't put out of my mind the fear I felt at the beginning and how finding this amazing treatment along with this fantastic forum helped me... I'm a Fruit Loop haha    I thank God I was blessed to be able to have the TARGIT IORT treatment, two reasons alone are... 1). My darling mum is in her late 80's, mum is my life and I am hers.   I really did not want to tell mum of my diagnosis, this way, I was able to say I was having 'a lump removed', and this is just how it seemed.   2). My BC was on left side, this caused me a lot of worry and concern, this treatment took away a lot of my fears in this regards.   Many of you know, this can make radiotherapy treatment that bit more awkward.  A lot of ladies have had the 'deep breath hold' treatment. I am not medial - so please what I type are my own thoughts and opinions.... With regards to chemo, I can't answer this.  I would 'think' this treatment would still be approached in the same way.  Depending if chemo was suggested 'before' or 'after' operation - I would say with both options the chemo would be able to be started sooner, as straight away the time scale of 3 or 4 weeks radiotherapy has been cut to 'one day'.   This combined operation and radiotherapy is not suitable for everyone one, for example, if you have more than one lump then I believe this treatment isn't suitable.   This all said, I feel the NHS need to start pushing this treatment to all suitable patients, both Doctors and BC nurses should be making all patients aware.",

Well, this is my pulse after walking up a small hill/road - it shows you how unfit I am.  I see my steps are down but my (just had to look up what it means) my active minutes, length of time moderate activity done has increased....

You got it right with my user name, when I first joined I could not think of a name, I sat and thought and thought, nothing would come to mind, all that kept going around in my heads was relating to BC - I kept saying What's Happened, What Happened and so this was my name, I always intended to change it - yet I still can't think of a good name, (apart from Ramble, as I do ramble on and on, on these posts, sending everyone to sleep :) ) HappyFeet1, you are so right with how I was, now get this, there is a gulley/walkway along my route (get me, I have a route too! I do change this daily though), the gulley is 'really' steep, so most days I make a point of walking down the gulley and back up again, I even try to throw in the occasional 'jog' .... all of 4 or 5 steps!  But it is far further forward than I was.  I am still fearful when I am out, I avoid the time the children come out of school as best as I can and to be honest, the way I dress I think they would rather stay clear of the 'bag lady' hahaha - I'm not that bad (am I haha). My Fitbit is set at 4000 steps now, i have up'd it from 2,500 - today though, I have actually done.... drum roll.... 9,846, I am going to get it to 10,000 before midnight - so I best get going (only walking around the house). Wishing you all a lovely weekend - extra special hugs to Leolady56 - I hope you are okay, always here for you if you need an ear.

My walking has slowed the last few day, I was enjoying it, the trouble is, I can't and don't feel like my fitness is improving, I'm still lugging so much weight around (I have lost weight, with change of diet - trying to avoid diabetes), but fitness, eg walking up a particular hill (road hill, not a hill as in mountain) I am not seeing any improvement - yet others walk up and down here to their houses all the time!! I found out about a site, you choose how many miles you plan to walk that particular month, you register (you have to pay), then at the end of the month you send in proof of how many miles your have walked (from fitness app, spreadsheet, etc) and if you have done the mileage - you get sent a medal with the month and year on it.  (when you register you can pay to enter just for the medal or pay a little extra and they send you a sports top too).  I can see it is open for people to cheat by sending in a 'false' spreadsheet - however they would be just cheating themselves.  I have just registered for this for this month in hope it will give me or help me to keep motivated.

I haven't posted much of late, however, do keep coming on and reading the threads - I've noticed the Happybird hasn't been around for some time, I am hoping all is okay - I've still got my lovely photo as the screen saver to my computer.

I went, if was hard, a little over 1 and a half miles - I'm pleased with this. Whilst out I did see a lady that I hadn't seen for a long time, it was sad, but, good to see she is still around.   I took a photo of one of the blue bells in the woods near to me today, it stood out from all the others... it looked 'a pinky/purple' rather than blue.  I will go back tomorrow and take another photograph with some of the others in the background, only having this one in the photo there is nothing to compare the colours to. This news of Notre Dame Cathedral is so heartbreakingly sad, 850 years old.  To see it get ravaged like this, it only makes me think of what humans are doing to our planet.  We are the ones that should know better, yet we are the ones that create so much damage (I know its not everyone - maybe I should delete these last few sentences, but, its how I feel.  We have so much good in the world, on our planet but we are destroying it.  I mean those nets across the cliffs to stop the birds from nesting - how crazy!!) I'm stopping this otherwise I'll be writing all night arrghh. Loving all the photos and posts.  Wishing you all well with appointments, treatments, results - sending love and hugs to you all xxxxx",

We have tried and tried and tried, I can do it around my wrist and arm (I wouldn't recommend anyone doing this now with the risk of lymphoma!! Around my waist, I just can't do this :( Ladies and Gentlemen maybe ronstar has given us all lessons on the hula hoop so we can have an 'indoor' activity - for when its too cold and wet to walk :)  xxxxx Before I go, I will confess.... No walk for me today, it was cold and raining - it's no excuse and now I feel naughty for not making the effort.",

Of all the life forms that should know better are us humans, of course not all are like this and thankfully people such as everyone on in this Group are the ones that help restore my faith in humankind.  You're all pretty amazing :)  ronstar  - That secret garden is wonderful, it looks great now, it can only look more amazing had the weeks go by.  I think it needs a little secret 'fairy door' adding somewhere :) ShimmeringUnicorn - Your photos of the beach are lovely, so many of you are so lucky to live this close to the sea - to walk along the beach, feel the wind on your face (yes I know Happybird hahaha) and the smell :o in the air hahahahah (I better stop this now hahah). Oww Shimmer, I'm fitting into the category of 'definitely might' get out tomorrow - if not definitely will on Monday :)  Happybird - Your baking looks so yummy.  I would love to be a lady that can just throw a cake together or an anything - saying that, I'd love to be a lady hahaha.  Loving the photos, I still have the beach view as a screen saver on my computer. (will try and attach have tried a few times).  It is such an inspiring photograph - Thank You. mrsox - Your walking is brilliant, I am going to try and up my anti - I need to walk further, saying this, I need to loose weight and can't stop eating chocolates and everything that is bad for me (I have given up crisps for Lent - how long will I keep it up for that is the question. I've even started watching the Winter Olympics :) To everyone out walking tomorrow - DO IT, just a few steps - saying this, after typing what I just have..... I am going to go out and walk just for 10 minutes - at least I will of made an effort (the reason its not longer, remember my walking is a secret to my family - so don't want to give it away hahaha) I'm going - its nearly 3'0'clock xxxxxx Nighty Night xxxxx (A.M.)",

I can't think how it happened, somehow I had dropped a very small bit of bread near the slug, I hadn't noticed and went on about my business (I may of been watering the grass), when I came back the slug was there 'eating' the bread, well I was mesmorised by this, that I actually video'd him.  I could see his little tenticals up in the air, I couldn't see his mouth, just the bread disappearing!!! Well I never, it was interesting to watch....  So the next night I fed him again hahaha - I was telling my Mum about this over the phone, mums reply.... you should do what I do, any slugs or snails I find (laughing now, hope none of you live next door to my mum)..... and slugs or snails I find, I throw them over the fence into next doors garden :o Its lovely how we all have our different ways.

      "Content": "Hello ronstar, it is so good to hear from you.  You won't bring the vibe down. We are each who we are and how we feel is us - it is easier to come on here when we are in a 'good place' or feeling a upbeat - writing on here when we are down and things don't feel good is hard and takes courage. I do believe just writing it down and getting it out of our heads is a good thing, plus this is where the site the lovely ladies and gents come into their own, hearing different view points can 'sometimes' spark a thought that can change everything. I am sorry to read of your relatives passing, makes it all the sadder knowing they were young. It seems like you hear about it all the time, every time you talk to someone or listen to the radio or tv you hear it over and over again.  I would think your family will understand you not being at the funeral. I have a second-cousin, we are not close, messages via. Facebook,  29 and a single parent - she has been given 6 to 12 months!!! My goodness, how do they carry on when hearing this.  In truth, they have to, they have to do what is right for them - to live as best they can for as long as they can. (I don't mean any of this light hearted and I hope it is coming out how I mean it. You can tell me to mind my own business, just read what I say then ignore what I've said or stick your fingers up at me hahaha..... (oww and it may come across a little mixed up, its all meant in a good way).... You can't blame your treatment on your daughters actions. You may of helped open her eyes to the life is short - but, really, this is a good thing, I think this is one lesson we learn from this dreaded 'thing'.  Once we can get over the shock, it gives us a kick up the a** so to say, to know what we 'should' do - doing it, well thats another story.  If you were looking in on this situation, you might see it differently as being the Mom.... We all think we know what is best, what is right and no one will truly change our mind until we are either ready to change or we see it in a different way. (then its all the 'I told you so's).   Your daughter getting married, just the word marriage will of triggered so many emotions and thoughts to you, even how you thought it would be or not be.  One good thing, where its right or wrong - it is getting you to travel to see your daughter and to met boyfriend.  I am finding I want to write so much, I won't, you know how I waffle.  What I'm trying to say is... Okay your daughter is getting married to what we have in mind is a 'wrong-un' - this is your daughters choice and if she has it wrong, I pray she will see sense and they will go there separate ways.  Maybe he has been arrested no end of times, maybe though, he is the nicest person you will meet, maybe he worships your daughter and treats her like a Princess, maybe once married they will settle to be so happy, maybe if he's not what he should be your daughter will say that is was wrong or its not working and they will go there separate ways ....... what I'm saying is there are so many 'maybes' that once your out there you may see it for how it truly is - don't let it push you and your daughter apart, just go with it - go with the live for today. Indirectly your daughters actions are already reaping rewards..... her Mom is coming to America to see her, Florida at that.  I believe you will know and fell far better going there and seeing for yourself. I hope this comes across how I've mean it. Sending you a massive big squiggy hug and loads of love xxxxx Ps.  I've not got out and walked for weeks, I've lost my motivation for getting out there, need to give myself a kick up the .... xxx    ",

In a way trying to take more control over myself.  I am always there for my friends, however, I have learned through BC this is not always reciprocated (thats a big word for me). Anyway, what I wanted to say is..... Please don't let the actions of others, where friends or family 'bring you down' - you ignore their reactions and as someone said to me years back 'it is your choice on how you react' - not your friends.  Meaning, if someone says something and it upsets you, you possibly would say, \"you really upset me with what you said\" and in truth..... \"you choose to be upset by what they had said\" - don't let them get to you. Brush it aside and work on whats best for you. Two fingers to them - only best not to let them know, just avoid them and get on with life Always here for you.  You have gone though so much - you don't need people to upset you, sod them, you are far, far better than that.

I should build up and push for a little further.  Trouble is if I am honest, I don't feel 100% safe while I'm out - this could be because this is 'not my usual, I'm not use to walking around near where I live (anywhere for that matter). I reckon deep down mentally this will do me good - I hope. Owww Amalie you are good riding your bike - this is such hard work, I admire you.  I am such a wuss, I bought an electric one, which is great, however, it is not any good for improving health.  When I tried the normal bike - I couldn't do it.  Remember Fruit Loops.... Keep Walking, one step and one day at a time xxxxx",

Its funny how we see and feel different with the different weather, you are right it does seem quiet when its misty and still too. Excluding the sun, I love 'wind' (funny with my name being Gail haha). I always remember the lady at our Post Office saying she could always tell with it was wind as the school children all seems to run around screaming  Well Done again Ronstar, one day at a time xxx",

What Happened (don't think I'd of got away with \"What the **** has Happened\"). The herb rosemary got its name.... \"Rose of Mary\" in memory of the Virgin Mary. Plus, they say Rosemary is a wonderful herb to smell, saying it helps aid with memory and is used as a sign of remembrance. Mind you changing the subject (going down hill now) did you hear about the man that has got a very bad lung infection.... caused by 'smelling his own socks' .... he did it regularly to see if he could wear them longer.  I won't carry on with this,I believe he will make a good and full recovery. You have got me wondering about roses now, I do love the smell of some roses. Let's see what tomorrow brings 'walk or no walk' and for once its not me not wanting to go, its is purely down to time restrictions and being in when the delivery man arrives. Hey ho xxxxxxxxx",

AnnJac just like Leolady56 says the jounry starts with the first step.  I will say, seven thousand plus steps compared to me is brilliant \"Well Done\" - just build up slowly.  Now if my phone app for walking is anything to go by, it tells me I have done around 2,100 steps and then equates to a mile!!! I would be well pleased to get past 4000 - but slowly does it, I don't want to do to much and put myself off (does this sound convincing haha). I had a lovely lady come in to my home some 10 plus years ago, I would so love to find another lady like her the trouble is 'its finding that special person' and in my case coming in and seeing how I have so lost my way and guide me out of the whole I'm in.  I keep trying t get on top of it myself and then think I'll get someone to keep on top of it - however, I seem to keep going around in circles.  Oww how I remember that feeling of walking in the house after my lady had been in, such a lovely feeling. Maybe a New Years project :)  Hey, I wonder Leolady56 should have a thread on household tips and motivation - you just seem to 'get on with everything'. When I read your posts of what you have done it motivates me - oww well, lets see what the New Year brings ;)  And before I run off.... lar lar lar 'can't hear you' ...... confession, I didn't go out today at all, I have sat in front of this screen doing all my christmas shopping..... online, arrrghh and NO WALK - and what does tomorrow hold, well deliveries will be coming - so how can I slip out for my walk !!!!! hmmmm  Sending love and hugs xxxx",

Have a great time xxxx Hello AnnJac and again I hope you had a good journey and that you find your mum in good spirit, this time of the year can be a sad time, so plenty of giggles on order. Wishing you well for the appointment xxxx Owww Violetsniff you made me chuckle, post of the week - this is so kind of you.  I am liking your suggestion of the 'reward' this does sound good. I may just have to put this into action xxxx I feel for you moomy, I've not long got over a cold, thankfully it had gone before Christmas.  I darling mum has one now, I'm in her bad books as I'm trying to avoid catching it - which means I've avoided visiting this week - I am phoning constantly throughout the day and would be straight there if needed, but... still in the bad book arrghh.  Wishing you a speedy recovery xxxx Hello Betty Mango loving the woofers, bless them. I hope all went well at the dentist. and now for my confession....... drum roll please.... I went out and walked, it took me a while to get myself together and pushed myself out, once out I had a really nice walk, I actually enjoyed it - I wonder if walking is something you can 'get into - that you want to actually go out and walk' - if so, I hope I can be part of this.   I really 'thought' I'd covered more steps than I actually had, however, I got out there.

Dearest Leolady56 - beware of the Charlies Angles imposters - I hear on the radio there was two ladies and a guy going round looking like Charlies Angels - you have been warned.  Loving the photos - wishing you a safe journey home, maybe try and stop and have a break and a little walk around to stretch those galloping legs  Sending love to all.",

Take prescription to the pharmacy... Possibly wait a day for pharmacy to get said tablets in, then.. Collect tablets from pharmacy... Open bag to check the 'correct' tablets are in there.

The liver is an amazing organ, it is the only internal organ that can re-grow, there are so many treatments available, I hope and pray something may be suitable for your partner.  (the hot knife, ablation).  My late father was referred to the Royal Free Hospital in London (there are other hospitals now with classed as 'Centre of Excellance', once there my Dad was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called 'neuroendocrine' in his stomach, what we didn't know, it had also spread to his liver. My late father was living life fairly normal with, walking around, gardening etc with... 90% of his liver full of tumours! Dads body was surviving and working with 10%!! - the specialist in London was looking at a monthly infection to 'keep everything' at bay and then if there was any shrinkage further treatment would be looked into .... What I am trying to say, and I sincerely mean this with all my heart, I pray that your partner has hope of responding to a treatment. I, like others on here understand about stopping the tamoxifen - it would be good for you to reconsider, take it one day at a time - you can always stop another time, for now, your partner and family and friends need you to be looking after yourself - so you can get thought this together. If you decide not to take it, then know we will still support you - we just want you to give it a re-think, but will totally respect your decision. My heart breaks for you, it truly does.  Always here for you, like it or not - I've got shoulders you can lean on, ears that I can listen and a mouth in case you need a few words of comfort or shouting at, most of all I have arms that can hug you. Your name always stood out to me and I have thought of you often.  I still have the photo you took as my wallpaper on my computer. You told me about the Polar Bear.....   Thinking of you and your partner, sending love and strength xxxx",

I hope you managed to get out Violetsniff, that you was able to miss the rain. Oww Leolady56 - it's a secret really, most of us humans are not allowed to know this, but.... since you asked....

I am so behind, one Christmas present got, no Christmas cards wrote, behind with work and house is a tip.... Helpppppppp Saying this, I am not stopping my walks, this is actually 'for me' - so I will carry on, slowly, slowly.  Last year when we started this thread I stopped walking after a week or so, and can only wonder where I would be health and fitness wise now 'if' id kept it up.  Well this time I intend to keep the walking up (holding breath and trying to believe myself).  I need to my blood sugars on an Hb1AC test (how blood looks over 3 months test) the range given is 20 - 42 mol/mol mine is/was 68, so well over.  (plus other readings out of range including Liver; Gamma GT and ALT).  So, before I go to doctors I am trying to change diet and get some exercise and see if I can help get the numbers down owwww - one thing after another. Leolady56 if you could see how I look going for my walks, I laugh at myself, purpose looking like a 'bag lady' so I'm left alone hahaha, you are right it is the mind imagining all types of things happening. I think the more I am going out the more I am feeling a little more settled whilst out - however, if I do have 'wobble' days, I will check in and out on here, 'Thank you for this'.  I really hope you are feeling better, it's not nice when we have a Loop down, just like a Chain we are only as strong as our links - Sending love and Big Hugs xxx Flossie25 sounds like you have had a good and productive day, why does it always seem to me that everyone can get lots done and here I am hours later still in the same place arrgghhh.   I suppose the walk is the only activity that I can see that I have done 'something' yet still seem to fall back behind as soon as I walk back through the door arrgghh xxxxx Picture from my walk today: Starlings happily singing in a tree...

My niece could not get over how happy and upset (in a good way) I was at receiving this - it was because of the thought, time and effort.  I am sure your family and friends will love your gifts.

Ladies, I am keeping up with the walking, it is a bit hit and miss with weekends etc - I am trying to become dedicated. Today, my walk had a meaning, I came across a poor lady that had taken a tumble, tripped over a wheel on the wheelie rubbish bins.  My goodness she had come a cropper, a massive lump on her forehead, grazed hands and legs - poor soul.  Eventually got help from a 'house of multi-occupancy' the residents there all have their own problems and helping this lady I think helped them.   The emergency services said it would take up to 60 minutes for the ambulance!!! What can I say.  I could not leave the lady alone, was able to contact husband, husband arrived just as the ambulance crew arrived.   I went on my walk, below is for today, I reckon this is one of my best so far.   Feeling good, if only I could clear my head and get on with my work.

Well, I will confess, I have had a s$it day today and all of my very own making.  I got up (late) got ready to go for a walk, thought have some breakfast first and can walk that off - so trying the low carb, high fat diet at the moment to see if I can get my blood sugars down. Well, sister texts, texts end of longer than a phone call, then the phone call, finally have lunch instead of breakfast.  Phone goes again, I sit down, saying get out and walk before the \"children\" come out of school, they are secondary school kids and come out around 3:15pm, however the streets are covered most of the time with them fighting and shouting.  Well 3:15pm came and went and I was still in the house, feeling made with myself, so what do I do, I go and lie on the settee and go to sleep, wake up so fed up and down, not only haven't done my walk, I've not done any work, nothing - so I have waisted and turned a good day into a cr$p day all created by myself! So to all the Fruit Loops that went out to walk a massive 'Well Done' - you are my inspiration to get out there. Sending big hugs and loads of love xxxxx ",

You mentioned persuasion, this is a definite, if I ask mum to go somewhere with me and she says no, I say, I'll leave it and then she'll say oww oww I'll come with you.  We have gone on like this and now mum will go virtually anywhere with me and this is lovely and makes me feel privileged - with this both my brother and sister now seem to think it is a given, that they don't need to take mum out and that mum and I are now a 'package'.  I find this so very sad, very sad that they both can't see on the joys they are missing out on and more so, how on earth must my dear mum feel.  Its at the point now if my brother was to ask mum to join them on a day out I know mum wouldn't feel confident enough to be with them and they certainly wouldn't try and coax mother into going (this would actually help, making her feel wanted and needed), all so very sad.  Thank you for your advice and kind words I will work on this. Have you any challenges set for today (Tuesday)? I'm still feeling good about todays/yesterdays walk, Monday, it was my longest yet, I got out and away I went - I have found out that I don't like walking 'down hill' silly you'd think uphill would be worse.

I was out for half an hour - which in the bigger picture is nothing, for me thought it is something.  I enjoyed my walk and said I must remember how I felt and make sure if I feel this way tomorrow to not put myself off.   AnnJAc the good thing is 'you are draining' and that is everything, soon you will be allowed home and to your own bed arrrrhh shear bliss.

      "Content": "So loving the wildlife photographs.   I can't get over how fast this time of year has come around.  It only seems like last year haha, no it only seems a few months ago that ronstar was posting photographs of the swans nesting last year.  If only I'd kept walking all through the year, would be far better condition than I'm in now.   AnnJac, very well done on your 6000 steps, thats really good, you have increased very quickly, very well done  I went out for a walk today, overall steps for the day is 6220, I'm pleased with this, trying to get up to the 10,000 a day - trouble is it take so long - or is that me walking too slow arrrggh. Whilst out walking I found 4 bees on the floor, sadly 3 died, the 4th one is 'just about holding her own' - so sad.  Can't help wonder if they have been poisoned, as all within a few feet of each other. Then to top it off, tonight I found this little chap in my back garden this evening...... I have since being told this little chap is actually a little girl - I thought she looked cute.",

I did and then had my best overall number of steps ever, well since keeping count.  I did (drum roll, if I do say so myself) I did 11,000+ steps. Mind you I looked like a beetroot when I crawled home haha   Sunnyone - could I ask a big favour of you and of course any of the ladies and gents on here.... There is a social media group on a well known website beginning with F - the Council is wanting to flatten the a 100+ Years old Allotments site and home to Robert the Allotment cat, Robert was feral and has other friends living at the Allotments with him.  The Plot Holders are trying to raise awareness and get signatures on a petition, so far so many kind people have signed that they are over 7,000 - they need more signatures to get Birmingham City Council to listen.  The reason for this, Perry Barr, Birmingham will be hosting the Commonwealth Games for 2 weeks in 2022. They support the Commonwealth Games, however the Allotments grounds were never part of  this progect. Now BCCouncil want to flatten the Allotments and lay to concrete to create a \u2018queuing system\u2019 for transport!! Please, would you help spread the word, sign and share the petition, you can even follow Robert the Allotment Cat on Twitter   The Group is called \u2018Save Walsall Road Allotments\u2019 - if any of you would sign and share this round be amazing - Thank You xxxx I\u2019m not sure if I could put a link up to petition at the change.org website   sending love to all  ",

      "Content": "Hello lovely ladies, I am still keeping up with the walking, I did my best ever on Friday... over 15,000 steps!! this is a record for me. I knew I wouldn't get chance walked over the weekend, so I went for it, arrghh think it will be a one off though :) moomy Thank you so much for taking the time to find and signing the petition.  This is very kind of you.  I noticed a lovely little snowdrop within your daffodils, my late mother-in-law loved snowdrops.  When I can get myself out walking again I am going to try and do 2.2 miles in 51-60 minutes (I'll let you know how it goes, haha). AnnJac I have to laugh, I found out how to do this on Friday, I did the most steps that I had, and had three green rings.... apart from the calories, well, I found I could alter this, so now steps are at 3,500 and Calories Burned are now at 1,500 = 4 green rings, okay I cheated, but, it made me feel good hahaha I must say, I was interested to learn what a 'swale' is - very interesting. Flossie25, I would so love to do early morning walks, I just don't think I will ever get there.  With been awake half the night by morning I am fast asleep and not surfacing till around mid-day and by the time I have procrastinated its getting on for 2:30pm before I get out walking! Owwww I'd love to turn this around. Violetsniff, your walking results are great, plus remember these only add on whilst caring your phone, mine look quite sad as I'm trying not to look at phone so often, so not caring about. Sunnyone, Thank you so much, the more people that can sign and share the petetion the better.  I haven't got an Allotment, I would love one, like you say, this would be tragic for them, even life changing.  Whats more maddening, the Commonwealth Games committee have said 'they do not need this land'.  It is the Council trying to steal it whilst using the Commonwealth Games as a cover - shameful. HappyFeet1, I love your photos, I love everyone, I have to say the Donkey and the Longhorn (?) cow are beautiful.    seaspirit44, I hope you are keeping well, loving the photographs - your daughter looks a good skier.  I've never been sking on snow, many years ago we tried learning at a local 'dry slope' - quiet entertaining hahaha. yellowroses, Thank you for your kind words, it is so true, they should leave this land alone.  I haven't got an Allotment, I'm trying to support for a couple of reasons, mainly this land as been an Allotment left to the people from the Calthorpe Estate, a wealthy family many years back, left for the people to use - so how are the Council to even begin to do this.  Then it goes deeper, the land has been Allotments through '2 World Wars' - it is fully used and well looked after, the Plot Holders are from all different countries, they have rescued chickens living there and also have 'Robert the Allotment Cat' and his friends, once feral and now all loved, fed and looked after. I believe the petition has gathered over 8,800 signatures - I really hope it snowballs and they get so many more. Amalie, well done you with your bike.  Maybe as my strength builds up I can progress onto my bike. I have spoiled myself, I brought a second hand battery powered bike and I love it (haven't used it this year) - well I think it was a bad move, I love it, I love going out on it - the trouble is, I can never see me going back to a peddle bike, I don't think I would have the stamina, I really don't.  One to work on I suppose. Leolady56, I send both you and Mr. Leo my love and thoughts.  This BC certainly sets off so many rollercoaster rides with our thoughts.  I had a hard time dealing with my first year mammogram - a time when you think your putting it all behind you was like it was all out there in front of me, every emotion going and to be told 'come on you need to get a grip (yes around your neck if you say this once more haha).  I spoke with Mrsox a few weeks back about this very thing, she told me she was discharged and I was, oww thats good and then thought about it and said, I don't think they should actually say you are discharged, as it sounds like thats it 'off you go' - I think 12 months on and we are still in a vulnerable place and need to know we have support waiting in the background 'if' needed! Hearing your discharged to me makes me think of the army and war times when - thats it off you go.  I imagine they like to use that word to clear themselves of patients, if anything else or any concerns pop up we go to our local doctor.  I think it should be a, well all your treatment is finished with, if you need us we are always here for you, however, its always good to contact your doctor first, however, don't panic - we are here for you. Sending you great big hugs and very best wishes to Mr. Leo Ladies, if I have missed any of your out, please know its not intentional, these posts take me forever at the best of times. Sending you all great big hugs and loads of love and ..... keep walking, riding, biking, and anything else, just keep moving - even if its only getting up and walking around the living room a few times or into the garden and back, its a start and thats all that matters. Ps. Look how far I have come, I remember posting on here about been scared going out walking, and lovely Leolady said I could come on here and clock off and back in.  Slowly we can do this, little by little xxxxxxx",

I'm walking, brrrr its chilly, walking, owww I'm out of breath, come on keep walking, okay this going okay, cheeks and mouth tucked into my scarf, Walking hmmm, I've got a fair way, again thinking have I missed my '10 minute alarm' - not sure how to check (note to self: remember the time when you set alarm). Hmmmm, I think I'm going to turn round (remember I don't want to be out when other half gets back, as this walking is our secret).  Turns around, then a little while after 'alarm goes off'. Wow I think, my goodness, look how far you can get in '10 minutes!!!!!' I then set phone alarm for another 10 minutes and continue walking back home.... I'm back in the house with kettle on and alarm goes off!.  A 20 minute walk - just can't believe how far 10 minutes took me. Now ladies, Aspen castor oil, do you rub this on your eyebrows, etc or to you swallow it?? This could be added to the 'tips' tread too. I'm like you, I've not told many people, let me think, 5 in total or there about. Other half, brother (and his wife), sister, my Mom (Mom only knows I had a \"lump\" that would be better to remove than left :/   and two friends.... one a life long friend, which to be honest seems I don't have the friendship I thought - sad really. But 'hey hoe' I've got my new friends on here. You will get through this, each day is a step forward.  I think you will find all this will make you a stronger person - not standing for crap people give out and move so the best bit of all, we learn how to appreciate and live life. Pssssss Penny Lane, just wondering if your forgotten it now.... A whole new worlllllldddddd, a whole new worllllddddd :) couldn't resist haha.  LeoLady56 beat me to the secret code that once told you have to raise one leg and swear you will only share on Mondays to people eating Hot Cross Buns !  Loving the photos - the views are fantastic. LeoLady56 how brilliant typing in word and copying over.  I can't tell you how many posts I've written, waffling on and on (no!! stop that now) only to post it and they have disappeared - I've then given up :(    I'm wondering if this is worthy of a list on the 'Tips thread?\" The photo of the tree with all its little burbles looks like its all dressed up for Christmas, how beautiful, unusual but beautiful.  Cannon well this will give me inspiration to keep walking, mind you my waist if it would like to ever make a reappearance, I recon I'll be walking for years - Very Well Done xxx  War and Peace is starting off again, sorry about this..... Owwww HappyBird this wind plays havoc with your cheeks :)) so funny.  So loving the photos and the Bumble Bee well who would think they are out already.  See with these walks and the sharing we are all starting to slowly wake up to our coming new lives, the nights are getting lighter and our journeys are moving forward - we are stronger, we are invincible, we are women (for Penny Lane and LeoLady56 to sing to us all :) I'm stopping waffling now - love to all you beautiful Ladies, hoping you all know how special you all are xxx Now if I'm not about - I'm asleep in a corner somewhere xxxxx",

I am not going to drop out of walking!! I am not!! ..... this happened last year, I may just look back on this thread and see when my walks declined.  I really need to walk.... to help loose weight, help my heart, help my liver and help me lower blood sugars and not to mention 'when you get back from a walk - you do feel better mentally than before you went'. I think this is called an affirmation, so this is my affirmation and I have said it now arrghhh - I will keep on walking. My concern is growing with regards to our lovely Leolady56 - I have not seen LeoLady on the site for a good few weeks now.  I just want you to know I am thinking of you, and hoping, both you and your husband are doing well.  I'm hoping your galloping around enjoying life and having a little break from the group.  Sending love and hugs to you xxxxx Right ladies, the sun is out, the sky is blue, theres not a cloud to spoil our views - fresh ('ish) air is calling xxxxx  ",

This could be made and took with you, like Seaspirt44 has said and you could donate it to the Ward.... even have an inscription engraved on it, something relating to how far you and the others have come and as this marks the end of one treatment it is ringing in the new start to life - a life that we are now free to feel and live (okay I'm getting carried away). This could then be donated to the Ward - it would be too big to get misplaced and if the Ward/CEO or whomever is acceptable of this, then the Handy Man can find a way to fix it permanently.   If its not to big a challenge for you - go ahead and do it - I'm sure you will feel so much better for it xx",

Confession time - I have not been out walking again today.  I can't use any excuse, I could... I didn't have time, it was too cold, I had too much to do etc - but, thats no good, I could of made time, I could of wore extra clothes. So, 'no excuse - just pure laziness'!!!!

      "Content": "Hello ladies, well, I have finally got myself out walking again, I went yesterday and again today..... after naughty missing at least two weeks!! Very bad!! I have to laugh though, it seems I have been meant to do these two walks, both were at times I would not walk and I'd pushed my self to go... Yesterday on the way back from my walk, going a different route, I walk into a young lad lying on the pavement, he had been knocked off his push bike on his way home from school.  Thankfully he was okay, very badly shaken up - the driver did not seem bothered, but, this could be shock.  Ambulance came and off I went. Then tonight, I don't walk normally of an evening, but was feeling 'come on you have to get out, try and achieve something today'. So, off I went, met a nice old chap that wanted to talk, so I walked and talked with him, again going a different direction to the way I wanted, but I felt this man wanted to talk, got to his house said goodbye and off I carried..... only to find a 'greyhound' dog walking in the road and a car narrowly missing him! I see the dog go down the path of a house and thought he was home - I looking like a nutter attract the lady in the window of the house (how is now looking at me like 'what do you want' - she comes out, I ask if she has a dog, at this the dog appears the lady screams and shuts the door.... I guessed the answer was 'no, she didn't have a dog' - her scream set me on to a 'oww what if he bites me, oww what do I do' I know, I'll take a photo and put on Facebook, then I notice the dog has a blue collar on him and a tag, I need to look at this haha, then I recall me other half saying a long time back 'how placid greyhounds are' so I call the dog - he ignores me, so, I go up and manage to look at the collar, the owner has a tag on it saying 'if found please scan me, I am microchipped', I know realise this dog shouldn't be out. I turn the tag over and I know the owners name and where he lives, so me and my new mate walk off together (me gently holding the collar) to where the gentleman that I know lives. (sorry I'm waffling). I gets to his house and the garage door is open, hmm I think that's it, that dog must of just walked out. Then I notice there is a window missing in the garage and no one is answering the door..... my mind is now on overdrive, I am thinking, someone has broken in, seen the dog and ran off..... then I have owww the owner may of fallen and the dog has got out - owww heavens for betsy his wife comes to the door totally oblivious to all of this. She looks at me and then looks at her dog, I explain all and let the dog go inside - she then tells me her husband has dementia and is always leaving doors open (I haven't seen her husband for around 7 or 8 years maybe longer, so this was sad to hear).  I am just about to go and turn around and the dog is back in the garage just about to let himself out again aaagghh! Thankfully the wife shuts the garage door and I hope all is good. Off I go walking home! I'm dreading to think what will happen tomorrow if I go out - maybe I should be staying home!  Sending love to all xxxxx",

I have never looked at 'nordic walking' - I did read about the sticks though and they sounded really good, now after reading about the walking I'm going to have a google to see if there are any classes near me - sounds very interesting.  seaspirit44, I love, love, love swans especial when I see them flying and hear the whooshing of their wings - it mesmerises me.  Imagine me thrill today, I had only nipped out into the back garden (to make sure my cat was not disturbing any of the young robins), well, I could not of time it any better, I could hear that 'whooshing' sound, I looked up and to my surprise it was not one or two or even three swans flying overhead, it was 'five'.... five swans!!! it was a lovely, if only I'd had my phone with me, I could of phoned haha - I could of taken a photo (here's my silly head now... whilst looking at the '5' swans flying over, it made me think of my family, we were a family of five). Owww I just deleted all this arrrghhh, then googled and found out how to get it back - few that's all I'll say Wishing you all a good nights sleep and a wonderful Tuesday to you all.

      "Content": "Dearest OCRKate, Of course you have to do what is right for you.  I hope you don't mind me saying a few things that might help and if they don't then please don't get offended by me saying them, this is not my intention and in truth I know at this moment in time you really don't need this. Would it be possible to go from 'session' to 'session' with the chemo - as in, 'just get one more done' then step back and recharge. Can you find a way to separate these feelings, it is not the chemo giving you the flash backs, the flash backs are they due to what happened not because of the chemo - it is your mind trying justify a reason not to have the chemo.   The chemo is to 'help' you - it has nothing to do with what happened to you as a child.  Maybe these flash backs are 'coming out of you'.  Having this journey at the start seems to break us - then, little by little we rebuild and although weak at first - I reckon we come out stronger and this could be the case for you, our minds are evil places and always make us see things at 'the very worse' - then when we face up to it, its not been as bad as our mind as made us believe it to be. I would like to add, your family and friends will support your decision - in truth what else can they do.  I don't know how far you are along with your chemo - but for you, try and get through another session, you are worth this, this is the new you developing from this, please try and stick at it if you can - then you can move forward knowing you have given it your very best. One other thought, on the social media site FaceB... look up The Speakman's - they are a fantastic couple, message them and tell them of your thoughts and fears and I am sure they will reach out and help you.  OCRKate, I know this is hard for you and it is your choice - whatever you do, we are always here for you and if you want to message me, if you think I could help you at all - please message me. Sending you love and great big hugs, Gail xx",

Chief Rescuer - moomy, I think they would run a mile if able to haha. So today, I did not go out .... I know, I hang my head in shame and in shame it is, I have spent the day 'walking around achieving nothing' and i will confess as I right this I feel very mad and angry with myself, if I had at least gone out I would of felt I had achieved 'something' - maybe even rescued something hahaha Leolady56, I hope you are well, it is great to see .... okay 'read' you posting, you are a mind of information and fun, not to forget your gallops.  Cracking photograph - how lucky they were with the weather.  I must ask 'where is the beach'? are you on holiday or do you live near the seaside? Oww puzzler , I hope it equates to two weeks, I can't be going through this every time I go out the house haha -its funny though, with the dog rescue, I look back at this and I know that walk was for that reason. (it may sound silly, I had an incident like this some 30 years ago, we were going out for a 'Wimpy' burger, well I umm'd and arrr'd about going, then we wasn't going, then we was, then we wasn't - half hour later and an argument - off we went..... only to find a great big black Chow Chow lying in the middle of the expressway, he looked like a black bin bag in the distance.  We stopped and picked him up, he was fine (although at the time I thought he was ill, as he had a black/blye tongue!!! - little did I know back then, that Chows are called 'Chow Chow's' and they have blue tongues! - we got him into the motor and took him to the main police station - back then you could, then even had kennels for lost and stray dogs. (I never found out if his owners was found - I do know if we had not 'umm'd and arrr'd' that night it could be been a different ending. Okay, I am waffling - hoping you all have a good day tomorrow, enjoy - sending love and hugs to you wonderful, kind and caring friends ... okay 'Fruit Loops' xxxx",

If I was you, with a deep breath I would phone up and ask if your results are back and if not, when will they be. This 'might' jog them along.   I went and had mammogram, ultra sound and biopsy all within an hour of each other - then got told 'there and then' what it was, but, could not give me finer details until results where back.  I had to go back on the Friday to be told in full. (This was NHS in Birmingham - they seem to have a really good system in place - I could not fault any of it, well apart from my result :( - this is when this site and the girls on here took over, the help, support, care and comfort was amazing, to be accepted and taken in and helped when at my most vulnerable, well there are no words that can explain how thankful I am and always will be. (more than family and friends). I don't think it is about how 'good or bad' your results are - I think its the silly system and for this reason I would phone and make enquires, say it is causing you upset and distress not knowing.  Even blame a family member for pushing you to call xxx  (and as the old saying goes..... the squeaky wheel gets the oil.... which I take to mean if you speak out and ask you will get help or answers). x",

What you could do, I'm not sure if this is any help, I would say contact your Oncologist and say you have been talking this over with family, you have told them what the letter to your doctor said, and they like you, totally disagree with what has been wrote - it looks like she have misunderstood how you are coping, could she re-write to your doctor telling him/her that you 'more than struggle on a daily basis'.  If she is not willing to do this, then, I would look into changing (again, I'm not confident enough to say its my decision; I would say my family want me to do this). I feel so much for you, I am only starting out on this road, but, what I have seen with others, you need to find a way to speak up for yourself.  One friend said to a family member (about something completely different, but, it made sense).... remember you are living with this every day, your doctor only sees you for that short appointment time and then moves on to the next patient: How will they know you are not happy or something is not right - if you don't tell them.

When I first went to me doctors with a slight dimple, my doctor had no concerns and referred me under the '2 week referral scheme' (not sure of the correct name) basically, if BC is suspected your doctor refers you and you see specialist at BC Clinic in hospital 'within' two weeks.  Your '5 weeks' to me is not acceptable.  I think you need to go back to your doctor and ask to be referred under this system. The system works very well.  You see a breast surgeon, have a mammogram, followed by an ultra sound, if there is an area they are unsure about (for numerous reasons, scar tissue, cyst, BC, fatty lump, etc) they will do a biopsy (normally there and then) and from this can give you an 'idea' of how everything is looking. You are very right the delay and waiting will cause you anxiety - I reckon most if not all ladies on here will say 'it's the waiting for results or treatment plan' that causes the most upset and stress.  Once you know what you are dealing with - you have control and know whats going on. Not wanting to worry you, but, better said than you think it yourself.... \"If\" there is anything wrong, first remember you have only a few months ago had a clear mammogram, so you hopefully could be worrying over nothing.  If it is something, well, you have set the ball rolling and have done something about it rather than waiting.  There are so many treatments available and believe me 'you will get through it' - once you know what is happening we can take it from there. Lets really hope your stay here is short and there is nothing for you to worry about.   Please keep us updated and if you have any questions or concerns don't keep them to yourself, there is always a 'Fruit Loop' about willing to help.   If you feel lonely during the night time hours (most of us start here, with all the 'what if's, etc' - look for the thread called 'Awake' and feel free to join in, ask questions, share your worries etc and we will do our best to help you through this.

      "Content": "Great question 232pookie - I'm 18 months on letrozole time is flying past, I can still remember the worry at taking the first tablet, yet what I did yesterday or the day before well, thats another story so to speak. I can relate to your post, I felt I was very fortunate with having 'very few, if any side effects'.... until, like Leolady56has suggested, until it started to build up, over the last few months I have developed 'trigger thumb' (same as trigger finger). It came on 'over night' I was asleep in bed and woke up with a pain in my thumb and could not bend it!! This carried on for some weeks, I was okay with this as it was in my right hand and I am left handed. Then same thing happened 'left thumb' locked - so for a few weeks I was 'hmmm what do to, read up on it and read that it can go without an operation, so first thought is to give it time. Sure enough, it has gone from my right thumb but, still remains in my left thumb.  Moving forward the last few days I have had back pain - in the middle part of my back 'on both sides equal' - (I don't normally have back problems, however, I have been on a rowing machine that last 7 maybe 10 days and I am wondering if this is the cause as oppose to a side effect of the lower oestrogen in my body.  Going back to words, you will see on many of my posts I have added words in brackets saying things like 'I can't think of the right word to say' or 'can't think of how to explain this'....  this sounds similar to you, I know what I want to say but the word/s will not come to me. Not so bad on here whilst typing as I can go back and alter when/if correct word comes, not so easy when in conversation and to top it all, it will normally happen if 'someone is actually listening to me' (not very often haha). I was telling this to a friend an ex-maths and science teacher, a clever friend and was surprised at what they said.... (hoping this is true, it made me feel better)... apparently the short term memory and mid-term memory is just that, it does not bother to 'store things that aren't that important' and again the mid-term is better at remembering but doesn't really bother to save all the information and give it to long term memories.... it only tends to pass memory that are worthwhile!!  This did make me feel better, but I over ran with how I related to this.... For the last week maybe two weeks I have being out walking, not far but have got out, I wrote in on the 'Walking back to Happiness' thread.  Now then, I honestly can't recall 'how many walks I have done' or how many days and .... this bothers me.  Other people would say, owww I started on the blar blar and have done a total of 'x' miles now.... well not me, it feels like its a few days and as for miles well the ladies on here suggested using an 'app' to keep track and this is what I have done. At this moment I could not tell you have far I have walked in total or for how many days!!! (it did bother me, then I recall what my friend said, we can't remember everything, plus stress and worry add to this, so for now, I am forgetting the thoughts of 'what I thought it was' (again another stress factor worrying about this).   For now, I am holding out my arms to the side and taking a deep breath in and then letting it all float out as I breath out (my late mother-in-law always said this, God Rest her beautiful Soul). I think we are all 'just to hard on ourselves - given what we have/are going through' - as Leolady rightly lets us know ... come on girls, big pants on - group hug' xxxxx",

I know the coming weeks the wait will drive you mad.  Whilst I was waiting for my operation, due to my worries and concerns, my consultation put me on Letrozole, this was given as an adjuvant therapy, to treat and possible 'shrink' the BC along with minimising my worry of the risk of growth. Dependant on age and operation most ladies are put on some form of adjuvant medications with the view of suppressing any secondaries, two of the main types of tablets are Tamoxifen (given to ladies that have not had the menopause) and Letrozole (given to ladies that are in or have gone through the menopause).   I wonder if you could ask your Consultant or Breast Care Nurse if they would consider, if it would be beneficial to you, to put you on letrozole whilst you are waiting for your operation?  It is worth asking.  Sending you 'Belated Happy Birthday Greetings'. - totally agree it was a rubbish present, I think after all this is over and you have got off this roller coaster of a ride, that you plan an extra special belated birthday treat.  Offering you gently hugs xxxx ",

Do you mind me asking how you found this out? Have you being having problems or pain?  You need to keep focused on how well the last journey went and how far medial treatments have come since then, there is so, so much that can be done these days.  No words I write will take your worry away, just remember the waiting is the worst time, this triggers us to worry, to worry about a situation that we don't really know the details about - if, such a small word, yet says such a lot... 'if' you can try to put this out of your mind till you get your appointment, you know deep down we can and do drive ourselves mad with worrying, having our mind come out with a million different things and little by little wearing us down. I am sure some of the other ladies will be along to give you advice, till then, please keep posting on here, together we will try to help you though this worrying time.  All will seem better when you have a treatment plan.

Night times are times when our minds decide to play us up - giving us all types of random thoughts, hence LondonLass started a thread called 'Awake' - there is always someone dropping in and out throughout the night and day.

I was where you was on 23rd August, 2017.  I only went to my doctor after seeing a photo/post on Facebook from a lady saying not all breast cancers are lumps - she had a dimple.  Well, I noticed when I lean forward I had a 'slight' dent on my left breast, above my nipple towards my shoulder area.  My Doctor seemed to think it looked like a 'natural crease line' - been a larger lady, my doctor did say she would refer me via the '2 week rapid access' - which, in a way I had peace of mind thinking its a 'crease line' and I'd be seen within two weeks.  The Breast Clinic was amazing, so organised. First I seen a Breast surgeon, he looked and thought it was nothing to be alarmed about, then on for a mammogram, followed by an ultra sound.  Whilst having the ultra sound the doctor took a biopsy (painless really, the worse part was the injection and that only stung). After biopsy, went back in to see Breast surgeon and he said 'well, I was not expecting this'.  I had to go back two days later for all details 'Left breast cancer, grade 1 NST, 20mm diamond ER positive.  Talk about shock. I don't want to scare you with what I have wrote and I hope and pray for you that it is a false alarm - put for peace of mind you do need to get this checked out.   ",

I am large busted, if there was a magic wand, I'd of had them reduced, but would never have had the courage plus I carry a lot of weight, so thats always been the centre of my thinking - my weight. I went from choosing between a lumpectomy or a therapeutic mammoplasty (having other boob reduced to match), I was so scared at the thought, with help from here I actually turned my worry around and was, for want of better words looking forward to having operation and coming out the other side with smaller boobs. My treatment plan then completely changed, I had a lumpectomy with combined radiotherapy.   My one boob is now smaller and, if I am honest, I do prefer this one now to 'old faithful'. Would I put myself through an operation 'to even myself up', I don't think so, I'm okay with how it is and mentally I could not put myself though an operation 'out of choice', I'm to much of a chicken.  In my 'day to day' life the difference in size doesn't bother me, I don't even give it a second thought.  The time it comes into my mind is when I look at myself in the mirror (I don't to that very often as I don't like what I see and thats nothing to do with my operation hahah)  - when I look and see, I think 'are look at poor old faithful' - would I have an operation to reduce old faithful.... naarrr, I can manage with this.... I haven't got the courage. So, I've waffled on and not helped, my final thoughts for you..... Don't have the operation if it is due to comments from oncologist, if there are health reason and she said it, then that is different. \"\"You have to do what is best for you\"\" - purely for you and how you feel.   If you reman unsure either way, ask them to give you some time, time to think about it all, I am sure they can give you this.

The world may look like everyone is 'happy' at this time of the year and if most are truthful its just not like this.  Since my dearest Dad passed, I try my hardest to be cheerful and happy - yet I can see Christmas in a different way, I see that every 'nice and kind' action brings heartache and upset to my mum - it brings back memories of happy times. Trying to be the loving daughter and saying to mum that we are all here for her, I asked mum why it upsets her so much, mums reply 'Because I know all my happy times have all gone, without your dad it will never happen again'. Even with family, sadly, mum still feels alone - to put this into prospective, I imagined myself at a wedding with family, however, being there without my husband (that he was at home) and yes, yes, I would feel alone even with family.   Sorry I have waffled on - sending love and extra big hugs to jmp - extra special hugs to you my friend and thank you again for all the lovely 'thoughts for the day'. xxxx",

If I touch my boob (which I avoid doing) it can feel quiet painful. The scar area is still 'very hard to the touch', I've been told this could take a few months to many months to soften - and then again it might never go away.

I was blessed not to have this - my treatment was lumpectomy with combined internal TARGIT IORT radiotherapy - (this is now been given 'limited approval' by NICE for use on the NHS at a few select hospitals - including the Royal Free). I truly feel for you as I know other ladies will on the site, we know how much you wanted to avoid this.  You gave it EVERY shot, you have questioned and questioned and tried different treatments, looked into it so deeply - we all know you didn't want this. You are here now with it, you have to turn this around now, a massive well done to you for doing this; knowing you are having treatment, I hope you can settle or ease your mind to find it somewhere in you to now feel that you are 'moving forward'.  You have done everything you can over these years - far more than most of us would have the courage to do.  I know how I felt stepping slightly out of the box, the nerves you feel when you are questioning treatments and then doing something in my case 'slightly different' - it still felt a massive worry and concern to me.  I had no one to talk about my situation (hubby was an ostrich - which would be the part I would normally play), then I found this site and the ladies and gents on here have helped me so much (more than they actually realise).  (sorry I'm waffling)... You need to work on getting yourself thought this the best way you can, you have come so far and can do this - there will be many that will step forward and offer you advice, letting you know how their treatment was and what/when roughly you can expect various side effects, etc or what questions to ask, what foods help, etc.  Massive Well Done Chloecat45 - I'm offering you a great big hug and sending lots of love to you xxxx ",

Knowing that you can't trust what you are told, well, yes you can, however, the times when we go to do this turn out to be the times when we shouldn't.  It would be so lovely to have full faith in all doctors, however there is always someone wanting to spoil it. With all the research you have carried out, you become more familiar than others, which is excellent, you just have to remember to ask questions so as not to cause upset.   I think concerning which ever hospital you go to, it's not the hospital its the actual consultants you see - you need to feel you can trust them (here we go again) and that you have a rapport.  You have come so far, this is a little mental blip - it is only natural you will feel like this, you are under constant stress - try if you can to take a small step back, have a little rest, recharge and you will be able to come back re-focused and with a clearer mind.

When you get panicky try to look at the 'here and now'.  Rightly or wrongly, I can't help but think 'how many people set of for work today and won't get the chance to come home' - am I being to deep with this.  I'm trying to say, 'at least we have a chance' xx",

They did say they have to take the brands that are delivered into them, however, a couple said if there was a particular brand they could try and get it if its listed (this wouldn't be Femara though). My suggestion is if calador, phone around your pharmacies, both near and further afield see if anyone has \"accord\" in stock, if so, take prescription and get from there, your doctor can't tell you which pharmacies to use. I wonder if this would be okay, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't, however you might need to get this checked out,... If you are able to source a supply of 'accord', you could consider alternating tablet brands each day. It would be good to hear others advice on this, its not something I have done, however, if I was in this situation I think I would. Wishing you all the very best with this, please keep on at your doctor - he works for you!!! (says me that can't say a word when I go arrraghh).

      "Content": "Dear calador, I can read your worry - you sound like I was when I first went onto letrozole.  I had worked myself up that much, it was like I was going to wake up after taking the tablet like some crazed monster. I was so scared.  Thankfully, with help and advice from the ladies in this group, I took my tablet and I am still 'me' .... as such, I do have side effects however, they are manageable.  One side effect I have at the moment is 'trigger thumb' (it came in both thumbs, however, it has worn off on the one, and I hope with time it will wear off on the other).   My new side effect is 'very achy hands' - now then, I take my tablet last thing at night and wake up in the morning with the stiff-achy hands - a few clenched fists and they come back to normal (although still trigger thumb - its locked in a straight position, funnily enough towards the evening this loosens up ever so slightly). Going off topic.  I have a couple of suggestions.   Firstly, for peace of mind, if you can stay taking your tablet I think this will help you.... regardless of brand, knowing you are taking the tablet can mentally help. Secondly, I do always wonder this, 'is it a side effect' or is it the way our body 'actually is with less oestrogen' - effecting different parts of our body at different times. Thirdly, if your doctor is prescribing a 'named brand' ie Cipla.... could he a) prescribe Femara and tell him you will take prescription to another chemist or  b) ask him if he won't do this, to prescribe you 'letrozole' on the prescription then... In the meantime you telephone various chemists and ask them what brand they supply, try the larger pharmacies. You are free to take prescription to the chemist of your choice. One thing I was told and I believe, is that when a doctor 'writes the name of a tablet' on the prescription - the pharmacy get reimbursed 'in full' because he 'has to prescribe the particular tablet'. Finally, instead of going without, even if you have a different brand for a month or so, you can look into all options during this time. If you do take a different brand you can then tell your doctor, you have tried a different brand and side effects are unbearable and would like him to prescribe the brand thats suits you (again, I think they have to do this, although I am not 100% sure, so would welcome anyone else advice/comments). A little light hearted joke.... It really is crazy the ladies on Femara behave like they belong to a secret group and have to keep there heads down and not make any false moves or eye contact, do nothing that will course anyone to notice them as they are handed over their tablets, they walk out of the drug dealers... I mean chemist, walking outside and then checking the paper bag and is it, is it, is it..... YEsssssssssss - jump for joy for another few weeks only to start the process all over again!!

Ask if they can have a look.

      "Content": "Hello kargus and all you other lovelies, I've got to join in, firstly... down there, I had a few days after my operation where it felt sore, although wasn't if that makes sense, I can't think who suggested it, but, they said a little bit of olive oil can ease any soreness. Now then the phantom smell, I have answered a post on here before about my experience - I am and have been going through this the last few days, I'll come back to this, In previous times I had this type of smell that, well, I couldn't actually smell it 'if I was trying to smell it' - it was random when I breathed. Cutting a long story short (I do have problems doing this), I had a bacterial injection on my lung - this had come from me swollowing a crumb of bread and it went down the wrong way - the smell was the 'bread' breaking down - rotting I suppose and of course breathing let me smell this indescribable smell.  A course of antibiotics cleared this up along with over 4 years of daily agonsing acid-reflux - the antibiotics cleared this up (and thankfully, it is still at bay). Now then, has I say, I have had this the last few days and was waiting for the back pain (by shoulder blade to confirm if I'd done the same).... nothing.  So, after a lot of thought this time I had put it down to the remains of a very bad cold back in January. I was thinking it could be still sitting on my chest - since taking letrozole the mucus I have is very thick and hard to move.  So either this or I am wondering if it could be a side effect from one of my Glucosamine tablets (not long changed brand).   The thing that gets me with mine.... it is a smell that you can't explain, it is like burning - although the other day, I said it was like a 'chemical' type of smell, the sort you smell in a dry cleaners shop - just so unusual. Regarding your results, I have to agree with the other ladies.  Firstly, they must look at everyones results straight away, within no time, because imagine if some one does have a serious diagnosis - they sit on results 'till they get around to them'.  So, I think the actual results getting back to your doctors this quick is the norm for that hospital.  I would hope that your Doctor would phone contact you and ask you to go in - if it was something serious.  Your doctor writing asking you to make a 'routine' appointment - could be just as it says to talk about your results and see how you are getting on.   The thing is no matter what any of us write and how plausible our words are - you will worry, it is our make up, its what we do best. I am sorry you are feeling like this and as much as I'd like to ease your worry - I know, I'd be the same.  What I will say is, you are the same as you was the other day and no amount of worrying is going to change anything - it is what it is (that sounds hard, I don't mean for it to be).  What I'm trying to say - worrying isn't going to help you - its just going to make you worse.  What ever it is you will get through this - you have us all hear and reading between the lines, try and take comfort from what everyone has said.

I was put on Letrozole 'before' my lumpectomy, this was whilst treatment was being arranged, I was put on it for 'peace of mind' for myself.  I was worried about 'it' growing whilst I looked into treatment.  I think it was for around 3 maybe 4 weeks and it did shrink it a little whilst arranging treatment.   But, being honest totally honest, I would rather 'get it out' earlier - than to wait for it to shrink with tablets for a smaller incision site.  After all the operation would be the same, if you are having a 'lumpectomy' - you would still be having lumpectomy.   I personally think, if you can have the surgery sooner - the sooner the better mentally for you.  If they have other reasons, like they 'need' you to have tablets to shrink then this puts a different light on it, if it is 'to shrink' for smaller removal - well sooner the better is my view for you both mentally and to get on with recovery.

I had my lumpectomy back in October (2017) along with SNB and to be honest, I had very little pain at the lumpectomy operation site, however, the SNB area was sore in a stinging type of way. You and your body have gone thought a lot, never mind your saying it's a minor operation, I thought this, until the ladies on here put me wise, it is a big operation, your body as so much to deal with, even the side effects of the anaesthetic, even this effects the body and takes time to come out of your system. Please be kind to yourself, you have gone through a lot and possibly now the reality of it all is sinking in.... sinking in, when you are now on your way to starting your recovery - it all happens so fast. Getting back to your pain, you must make sure you do the exercises you have been told about, these are very important, to keep everything free moving.

      "Content": "Hello kathleen37, Deep breaths, deep breaths, calm down, this can't happen over night, but.... you are working on it and this is the main thing. First, I'm not a doctor, my thoughts are my own...... I am over weight, I have been for a number of years, I have lumpectomy October 2017.  I was told and I also read that oestrogen can be made by the fat cells in our body.  So, I was right, got to do something about this..... it didn't happen.  I take Letrozole and had every intention to loose weight.  Far easier to say than do, I was still in shock with all that had happened and I guess I was comforting eating, I needed lots of comfort, plus I'm only 5'2\" (if I was 8'6\" I would be the right weight for my height, haha).   I wanted to loose weight, the one consultant even said to encourage me, lets see how much you can loose when you come back - hmmm 'none' :(  Fast forward 12 months, I go for my 1st Year mammogram, check up etc.  I have a blood test, my results come back, so many results 'out of range' - I am in the diabetic range, my liver results (Gamma GT) out of range, Triglycerides out of range. My HbA1c is 68 (range is 20-42) over 42 is diabetic...... I was floored, this totally floored me, I had gone through the BC and then this!!!   I was told to visit my own Doctor have bloods done again and ask for a liver scan!  I was going to post on here for help, I kept putting it off.  The shock was amazing, I have used this to 'try' to turn every thing around.  I gave myself 3 months (the Hb1Ac only changes every 3 months - its like window to our body for the last three months).  So, I gave myself 3 months to 'try' to change things around.  I have cut down on carbs (no bread now), I am 'sort of doing Low Carbs/High Fat' - I am walking (originally suggested the Walking back to Happiness thread to Leolady), I am now walking around 1 to 3 miles a day - most days!  I have lost nearly 2 stone. So my thoughts are, loosing 'any' weight has got to be good.  The less fat we have, the less fat we have to make the oestrogen. Carbs turn into sugar.... apparently, 'C' loves sugar, so, by reducing the carbs, this will reduce levels available to turn into sugar. Fats don't turned to sugar. Carbs do. Maybe \"that going low carb can give you a huge boost of oestrogen to begin with \" <<<< maybe this is actually using the oestrogen stored in the fat cells - or maybe it is pulling it out of the stores ?? Just a thought. My last thoughts are, we can't turn this around 'over night', the main thing is we are taking steps to do this, ANY step forward to reduce weight is for the best.  Reducing carbs = reducing sugar.  This can only be a good thing. As I say, my thoughts, still check it out with your Nurse etc.  The main thing is by loosing weight - this will reduce fat stores and if oestrogen can be made or is made within fat cells, the more we reduce these the better. Hope this helps a little xx",

I can say now '2 months' down the line it was the best decision that I made along with feeling humbled been 'lucky' enough to have this form of treatment. Wishing you all the very best xxx ",

We must remember letrozole is our friend and its not the letrozoles fault, this tablet is doing its job, getting the oestrogen out of our bodies and these are 'our' side effects of the oestrogen coming out..... not to mention I have trigger finger in both thumbs - ouch You have gone through such a lot and with the added pressures of work and life in itself - it could be a mixture of both the letrozole and depression.  How about trying some herbal type of pick me up ... (can't think of the name, arrghh) plus getting out and having a little walk will help (I should practice what I am preaching). I think retiring will be a massive tonic to you - it really will.  Sending love and hugs xxxx",

Thats a good one Violetsniff - 'Don't do that'   Lovely words Sunflower76  - I do can relate to this, from finding this Group of amazing people back in October 2017 - the people... \"friends\"  on this site have given me more support than family and I will be forever grateful. I can totally agree with you seaspirit44 does feel hard to put ourself first, I have been brought up to always put others first.  Since BC, well actually not since BC, I would say twelve months following treatment and slowly getting myself back together - then having high blood readings for various things - this gave me the push that I need to 'look after me\" - \"to put me first\" - whilst I still can and, yes, it is hard but I am doing it.  Even getting out for my walk, I class this a 'doing this for me, me time'.  Get this, tonight after my bath, I sat on the side of the bath and actually put foot cream on my feet - it felt lovely, but its something I never take time to do.  I am going to 'try' to stay in this frame of mind, so the coming New Year is 'my' year - for 'me'.  I will still care and love my family just as much, only I will (try) love me too.  Come om Seaspirit44 lets start a new trend  Sending you all love and hugs xxx I've had to edit this....

I can't see anything wrong with mentioning joining Macmillan Online Community - I would think any good publicity would be welcomed, plus, your video is so upbeat they might learn from this too. Win - Win I say. I haven't really told anyone about my journey other than in here. However, I would feel comfortable sharing this on my facebook page... that is, only 'if' you want me to. No offence if you say no. 'Fantastic video's' - Love and Hugs xxxx",

In November 2017, at a 'check-up' I was told my levels were a little low - however, nothing was prescribed or suggested. November 2018 25 OH-VIT d (Vit D2 + D3) = 64nmol/L (range.... < 25 Deficient 25-50 Insufficient >200 suggest reduct dose of Vit D Looking at this, I reckon I am on the low end of 'sufficient' - think I should take a regular supplement ?? (I have a rare skin condition that started around 6 years 'before' BC - following surgery for BC the skin condition seems to be disappearing!!).  Back to your question, before operation, I was told my levels were 'slightly low'. I hope this helps,  any thoughts about levels - do we want higher or lower levels ?? (Sending love to Carolyn and Snowys Mum, hope you are both keeping well xxxx)",

I had wide local excision, I had no visible stitches on the outside of my body, however, I can't remember how long after operation this happened, only a week or maybe two... it was at the 'one' end of the operation site, I thought it was a small blister, then I thought it was tiny scab, so ignored it, however it felt rough to the point where I sort of kept touching it, then low and behold I could see a little bit of clear nylon (I imagine, similar to nylon fishing line). I phoned my consultant and also posted on here, I had what is known as 'spitting a stitch'.  The body is trying to get the foreign object out of the body.  My consultant said so long as there was not itching, redness or soreness all would be okay and it would work its way out  It did, the tiny bit of nylon over the coming days became a little longer and a little longer, till the one day I was touching it and it came off/out (with a tiny bit of help from me) it was a strange twisted shape, which I was a tiny knot.   I have photos, however, I don't think anyone would want to see them If it is a 'spitting stitch', it will work its way out naturally. I hope this helps a little - Good idea to see what you GP thinks. xxx",

I don't know what to say, the waiting is the worst part of all this along with processing it in our mind and how we deal with it, then slowly comes the strength.  The liver is an amazing organ and one that can regenerate.  My dear Dad had tumours in 90% of his liver and we didn't even know, at this time he was living a normal life. CrazyKnitter and puzzler you are walking a path many of us fear every day, we always need to remember how far treatment has come and how fast treatments are changing; there is so much they can do to help and heal the liver.   There are groups on this forum for secondaries that might offer ideas and help.  Keep posting here too, we are here for you and will offer help and advice if we can, most of all we can offer support, comfort, laughs - you name it will we be here for you.

I totally agree with all that Taralou has said.  I would just like to add this thought..... Could these aches and pains be 'side effects' or....... could these aches and pains actually be how our bodies feel having 'less oestrogen' ?? Would you still feel like this after changing to another type of tablet, or to a different brand? Could the various tablets take out oestrogen in different ways and each of our bodies feel different. Maybe it's not a side effect, maybe each of our bodies each react different depending how much the tablet has lessened the oestrogen.. Just a thought  xx",
