      "Content": "Hi, I was ok for about 2 days after then it hit really hard. I had really bad aches and tummy problems. That all lasted for about a week. I feel ok now just a bit tired and i think next one will be better because they have given me some new medicines to counteract some of the side effects. Doesn't it feel good to say i've only got to 2 treatments left!! At the start it feels like such a long journey but it has gone really quick. How have you found it? Have you got to have radiotherapy?
