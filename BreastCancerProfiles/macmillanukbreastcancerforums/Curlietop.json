    "Content": "Hello! I have been recommended for a TUG reconstruction (from inner thigh), but fitted initially with an expander for 6 months in order to creat more skin to reconstruct a breast that is nearer in size of my remaining one. I do not have enough skin on my tummy , thigh or bottom to reconstruct one that is as 'large and droopy' as my remaining boob , so it has been recommended that I then have it reduced in size to match the reconstructed one. All sounds complicated and alot of messing with body parts that do not need to be involved. In order to help me decide what route to take with regard to reconstruction and no reconstruction is there anyone out there who has been through a similar reconstrution experience that can share their experience and thoughts on this complicated matter? I would be grateful to hear from you!",
