      "Content": "Hi Ladies, Background first. My partner died 6 years ago. Mum and Maternal Grandma died of BC 4 years ago. Last year I turned 50 and thought I should think about my own life again, my daughter had reached 18. I started chatting to a few men from a dating website and things were going nicely. 4 months later I found the lump. I knew then that I could not think about a relationship so made my excuses and bowed out. I did keep in touch with one gentleman. I explained I was quite happy to be friends, but needed to concentrate on my illness and treatment, so nothing else was on offer. We have met 6 times in 12 months, for a meal.We have taken it in turns to pay for this and that is where it has stayed. We do talk on the phone and email, but as friends.He lives 3 hours drive away. He has also sent me some flowers, chocolate or bubble bath, occasionally. End of chemo, treatment, that sort of thing. Last night, I found out, from my friend, that a lady acquaintance of his, thinks he should not speak to me any more, as I might be making the whole Breast Cancer thing up, or at least, may just have had 'a bit' of a problem. I have had a restless night and feel like photocopying my files and sending them to him to pass on to her, to prove that I have had Cancer. Yes, I did have an easy ride compared to a lot you ladies. I had lumpectomy with my nipple moved and then all the nodes removed, 6 sessions of FEC-T and then 3 weeks of rads.I did not, however, shave my head, to gain sympathy. I shaved it, as my hair was falling out because of the chemo. I cannot believe that any woman, especially as she was in tears at the thought of going to a routine breast screening, so I offered to talk to her about it, could  think that anyone would pretend to have BC. I also suffer from prolonged bouts of acute depression, I was fine through the BC, but this has knocked me for 6. Ladies any thoughts about how I should handle this, I cannot get my head around it at all. Thanks, I know I will receive the best advice here, as you all know what if feels like, to go through the illness and treatment. Rant over, x",

      "Content": "Ladies, could I just give you my experience, in the nail department. My nails were strong and in excellent  condition, until the last chemo session.Six sessions of FEC-T. I wore black nail varnish throughout, on fingers and toes. I looked after them, with meticulous care and was congratulating myself, how lightly, I had got off. There was no yellowing, flaking, or signs of blackening. On my last visit to my Oncologist, she told me I would probably lose some of my finger nails, they felt a little tender, but I had had no major problems. When  I visited the Radiotherapy Doctor, she confirmed I would lose a few nails. She told me that they do not come off until the chemo ridges, (like tree rings, one for each chemo session) reach half way up the nail. They then break off, at this point, as this is the weakest area. This has happened to me, in the last couple of weeks. My last chemo was on the 11th June. On the plus side, there are some jobs I've managed to get out of, because of my poor nails. The Doctor, just told me to tape up the effected nails, to help to stop snagging them. I have done that and all is going well. So far 4 taped, 6 as yet OK. Toe nails all in tact. I have 2 friends who last year had breast cancer and the same treatment, one had this problem with toe nails and one had no problems at all. It appears that it is pot luck, as to whether it affects you. Have a good weekend ladies, take care. x",

      "Content": "Hi Kittycat, I continued for 3 weeks after my last chemo session, with the black polish. I don't think I will ever wear that colour again! Then I changed to a good quality nail polish and  a base coat with vitamins in it. One with a lot of pigment and staying power, as I didn't want to be using nail varnish remover too often.I figured if I continue a few months more with some protection on them, it may help. As for the Taxetere, In terms of right after I had the treatment, I would come home and curl up on the sofa, for a couple of hours and then just go back to my usual self. I hesitate to use the word normal as my teenage daughter, says I am not normal.  I hate to say it, but I didn't have any problems with energy levels, while on it. I know lots of people on here, have terrible side affects with the treatment. I had the odd early night, but not a great deterioration in my health, at all. I had been walking the dog for a couple hours a day, until the week after the last round. I got a few blisters on my feet and I think that was purely because, my skin was sensitive. 3 months after the chemo finished, (I had 3 weeks of rads, which finished 3 weeks ago ) I would say, I'm 99%, back to strength. My tips, such as they are. Don't try to be Superwoman Kittycat, try to relax, when your body tells you to, do try to do a little exercise, such as walking, because you need all the feel good endorphins, helping with your mood. Drink lots of fluid and eat small meals, but regularly, to keep your blood sugar levels stable. You may lose your sense of taste, as well.To me, everything tasted like card board. Mind you, I had apple crumble one night and teamed it with strawberry yogurt, as I didn't have any cream. I couldn't taste the difference and I l got the benefits of the lower calorie count. Oh and if you can treat yourself to a little something nice each day to boost your self, that would be good. I used to have a bath with bubbles, to warm and relax my muscles and to get away from everything. I really hope things go well for you and if I can help in any small way, just ask. If you wish to talk privately, just friend me on here. Take care and good luck x",
