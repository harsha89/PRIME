      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I am new to this group and not even sure if I am posting in the right place!! I am 46 years old and have been diagnosed with ILC with lymph node involvement. I have annual mammograms and am breast aware but apparently ILC rarely shows on a mammogram as it is a bit of a sneaky one! I've had a mastectomy with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction which I am in week 4 of recovery from and a level 3 lymph node clearance. I am starting chemotherapy on Tuesday 6th June and will be having 4 cycles of EC 3 weeks apart, followed by 12 weekly cycles of Taxol and 3 weeks of radiotherapy. It all sounds very harrowing but I have been told that the 12 weekly part is the new \"norm\" and he wants to treat me aggressively due to the size of the tumour, the lymph node involvement and my age! Anyway sorry about the waffle but just wondered if anyone else will be going down the same road as me. I'm petrified of the chemotherapy and how it will affect me and would be grateful of any sound advice or tips. I'm going to try the Paxman cold cap as the private hospital where I will receive my treatment has got good results using it and I'm trying to keep things as private as possible but I do have a good wig for back up!!",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying, sounds like we had a fairly similar diagnosis. Do you mind me asking if you coped well with your chemotherapy as we have had to sadly cancel our holiday to Mexico for my husbands 50th so was hoping to try and get away with the children to Center Parcs or somewhere if I felt well enough? Also, did the cold cap work for you? Thanks for all your little tips! Glad you are coming towards the end of your journey and that it has gone quickly and that you have coped so well x",
