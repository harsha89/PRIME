      "Content": "Hello Mandy,  I am new to this site but have been reading posts for the last 18 months.  I eventually chose a round block mastoplasty and level one lymph nodes removal and was very lucky that this procedure was newly available in the area  that I live.  I am very happy with the results and my decision. The recovery was relatively painless and my right breast is about one cup size smaller.  Have you made your decision yet or would you like more information. Best regards Bunky2",

      "Content": "So, So sorry to hear of your loss and the injury to the othe dogr.  My two GSD's and my horses helped me enormously.  Unfortunately my older dog had to be put to sleep in February and my beautiful horse got colic and died on the operating table the same month. I totally empathise with you.  Yes I did get bad headaches after this for a while, as I am a migraine sufferer.  These stopped, but I still have headaches  and nausea which started and never left during my  Herceptin. I have now finished Herceptin and still have daily headaches and nausea.  Hoping this will improve as my body detoxes and hope the same for you.  It is better to be checked by the Dr. though. I did get another rescue GSD,as my other one was pining, and this has helped us all enormously.  It takes a while to regroup after this kind of trauma in your life but stay strong and remember all the good times you had together. Love Jo xxx",
