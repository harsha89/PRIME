    "Content": "Hi Benjio I was diagnosed with DCIS is Feb this year after going to my GP with a leaky nipple (tiny bit of blood every few days) I was sent for a mammogram and ultrasound which were both completely clear. As there is a 24% chance of a false negative (a clinical trial paper i read about on MedPub) I was sent for a small excision to remove an area which when pressed made my nipple excrete. They found some cancer cells in the tisue removed. I had further surgery in April where they removed my nipple and the milk ducts. They found cancer in the extent of the tissue removed and I was advised I had to have my breast removed. My question at the time was...how do i know for certain that i don't have the same issue in the other breast. The mammogram and ultrasound were both clear. I was advised that an MRI would also have not shown the cancerous DCIS and therefore even an anual MRI wouldn't have helped. At that point I decided on a double mastectomy. I had councelling but because my DCIS was aggressive (but not invasive) they had to do surgery quickly.  Post surgery (6 weeks ago tomorrow) I am so glad i made the decision that i did. I had a 19mm in the breast that was bleeding and an 18mm one in the breast that had no symptoms at all. As I say in the beginning, it's only a 24% chance of a false negative but I thought that was enough of a chance to make sure it  was investigated as far as was possible. I had recontruction at the same time so they saved the breast skin and refilled it with fat and tissue from my stomach (gross but very effective to get a 'normal' breast) and they will remake nipples from some of the stomach skin thay patched in circles where my nipples were and then tattoo them later.  I hope i haven't scared you but have tried to be as honest as I can. I feel I've had to do a lot of research on my own and have only been told part of the facts/prognosis/potential outcomes/likelihoods etc etc etc by the hospital!   Best Paula xxx ",
