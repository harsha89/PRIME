      "Content": "Hello, I am also in the family and friends group but a lovely welcoming lady there suggested I come and join this group too. My sister has just had a diagnosis of breast cancer in the last couple of weeks, to begin with the consultant said it was curable, that she had a large lump and a smaller lump and that it had spread to her lymph nodes but that they were treating it as curable. But they said they had also picked some other cells in her chest but didn't elaborate. When she was then passed to the oncologist the following week to discuss starting treatment, the oncologist wanted a scan to determine what these cells were so she got brought back in for tests. These results we had last week and we were told that it had spread to her chest wall and that it was now not curable but treatable. This has been a huge blow to my sister who is a single mum of three children under 10 (the youngest is 20 months) and as a family we just are trying to support her in any way we can. She started 'aggressive' chemo this week and has then been told she'll have surgery next. We've done some research based on what the consultant has said and we think that means it's the locally advanced breast cancer which is stage 3. I hope it's ok I post in here and share our experiences with you. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Leolady56 for the lovely welcome. Yes, I have stuck to the reputable sites, I too am very wary of the internet. It's all been so confusing in the appointments as the doctors aren't bombarding my sister with terms or grades etc at the moment so me and My Mum have just been trying to stay a bit more informed, plus at the moment my sister isn't really processing anything so she's not really wanted to know any more. Yes the school know, it was one of the first things my sister did and so the teachers are looking out for the 2 who are at school, we're also hoping for some help from our local cancer support network as they offer fun stuff as well as counselling for the children, it looks like a great service. The kids are understandably worried about their mum. Thanks again :) ",

      "Content": "Thank you too Lesley, it's so encouraging to hear great stories about people doing so well. My sister is only 39 so young, but she'd probably be the first to admit she's not too healthy. She's in a bit of denial at the moment and even thinking about it all panics her so she's not really want to read too much of the information she's been given but I'm hoping that given time, she'll be able to. Thank you again for the lovely welcome, it's so nice of everyone.",

I'm glad this has helped you, even though it was hard.  I am really hoping that my sister will feel she can talk to someone at some point, either in person or through the forums, I know that no matter how supportive we all are in the family, no-one will quite understand as much as someone going through the same or a similar experience. Thank you so much for the welcome and the hugs  ",

      "Content": "Hello Trucker, I'm so sorry if my post caused you anxiety, it sounds like my sisters case is very different to yours. There are definitely cancer cells that have been found which is why we know it has unfortunately spread to her chest wall, this is why she has had this change in diagnosis. Good luck with all your treatment, I'm glad to hear it's almost over. Sazzat",
