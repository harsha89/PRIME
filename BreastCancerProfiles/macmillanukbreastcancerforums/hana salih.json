    "Content": "hello Lellis I was treated in Marsden hospital where they had both private and nhs and treatment wise was more or less the same they mught have better option on food menu and if you were a transpalnt patien they will find a donor for you quicker. But I have to say the support it i got there was fantastic from physio to massage to therappist which i still see even though i am discharged from hospital but im affraid things tend to get out of your hand and every thing is planned for you but look at it as posetive thing that you do'nt have to worry about arranging appoinments and treatments Â ",
