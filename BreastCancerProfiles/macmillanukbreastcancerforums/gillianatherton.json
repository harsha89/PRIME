I am going back to work next tue an its 9 week this fri since my op its work thats been keeping me off cause its a tough manual job. Yes there is some pain and discomfort but i didnt find it any worse than the mastectomy i suffer with a frozen shoulder and thats were i had most pain.  When i came round from the op i had one of them pain machines on me i didnt need it they took it of me the day after i only press it twice an that was only to see wat it did. All i needed was normal paracetamol I came home on the mon i was out at the pub at the weekend The main advice i can give u is get a sports bra bigger than normal i wre a normal bra wat i had at home an it caused my scar on my back to weep its all healed now I did have a bit of swelling on my back build up of fluid thats why u need a bigger bra but it didnt bother me  my scar on my back is hidden with my bra . Please go ahead and have it done it looks really good an natural people cant belive how good it is i have to wait now 6 months before th nipple job . take care an please let me know how u get on anything else u want to know just ask gillian xxx   ",
