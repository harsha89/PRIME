I'm quite needle phobic and the oncologist and chemo nurse looked at my veins in my hand and advised that I would be much better off not having chemo through them due to the risks/difficulties of veins not coping. I'm a bit sore from the procedure and was terrified beforehand but actually it was quite straightforward with Christmas music playing in the operating theatre! Might as well ask the question, they can only say no.....",

Following my callback appointment I went through a whole range of thoughts and feelings waiting for the results and had even convinced myself that there was definitely nothing there, despite what the radiologist had said.  Please take someone with you for the results. I took my husband who had strict instructions to say nothing and make notes.

      "Content": "Hi NiceCuppa, I have found EC to be much harder than the docetaxel. I think the effects are just more generalised, not having any energy has been really tough. I've also found it generally harder to bounce back to a level of normality each time, but maybe that's because of the cumulative effect rather than the EC as such. I know what you mean about the bouncing back not really happening until into week 3 and even then not quite right. I've been really struggling with sleeping as well (due to steroids) which means I feel permanently tired. As I had a portacath fitted prior to any chemo and all of my chemo has been given through that I haven't had to contend with knackered veins, but now I need a date to get it removed and I've been told they will wait for a minimum of 3 weeks post chemo in case I end up with an infection before then that they may need to access the line for.... Good luck with your radiotherapy, do you have a start date yet? I am due to have 15 rounds of radiotherapy, I had my radiotherapy planning appointment the day after my last chemo so just waiting for a date to start, but planning for it all to be over by end of May!!! I had planned to go back to work mid-way through radiotherapy, but have decided to wait until its all over and done with so I can have a little more recovery time. I keep getting asked whether I want to go back to work full-time, but I really need to work full-time to pay the bills so not a viable option. Also, my husband had a redundancy threat while I was undergoing treatment so don't feel that I can go back to work anything other than full-time. For anybody starting out on chemo, you can do it. Take one day at a time and be kind to yourself, always xx",

I also cold capped and have very very thin hair on top of my head. I've been washing my hair as little as possible to try and preserve what I can, but it is so fine and fragile and still coming out (just not in great big handfuls). I've booked to get it cut really short in a couple of weeks so that the new hair growth can blend in a bit better. I haven't had short hair since I was a kid so will be a huge change for me.  I'm hoping that having some hair will be an advantage when it does start to grow back.  take care xx",

She hasn't been wanting to involve me in work decisions when I have asked for some involvement, has asked me repeatedly about whether I plan to return full time, despite me saying that was my intention from the start, but has then sent me a text with a job that I might like to apply for!!

I have been on steroids for 7 days for both cycle 5 & 6 so finally finished them now but I was also prescribed sleeping tablets to take on the same days of steroids which means I get about 3 hours sleep, but like you, I have terrible hot flushes at night which keep me awake. I have been told that they offer acupuncture sessions at the local Maggie's to help with hot flushes so will be checking that out as soon as I feel up to it.  I had a really bad throat/yukky mouth through cycle 5 and was prescribed mouthwash and gelclair which helped to calm things down, might be worth asking?

One of my friends from the yard sends me pictures of Annie quite regularly so I can have my horsey fix and tonight she sent me a video of her which cheered me up.

I had been told that I would likely need chemotherapy after surgery as my tumour was a grade 3 so not totally surprised about the need for chemo.. It turns out that what they had seen on scans and diagnosed as a 12mm invasive tumour along with widespread high grade DCIS was actually 60mm of invasive tumour. My lymph nodes had looked clear on scans but 2 out of the 3 removed had micro involvement....my head is spinning with the news. Still waiting to hear whether I am HER2 positive or not as my initial biopsy was borderline negative so is being repeated. So chemo it is for me, followed by radiotherapy. I can't quite believe this is happening, I was fit and well and very active a couple of months ago.... ",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa_F so sorry you find yourself here but it is a useful place to have questions answered. I finished chemo in April and was also lucky enough to have my treatment covered by my husband's private medical insurance. I wasn't given the choice of treatment at home, so can't help you with that as I had all of my chemo at the local private hospital. I cannot fault the team delivering care, they were kind, responsive to my needs and very caring. There was also a Maggie's representative on site who I spoke to a number of times during treatment. There were some disadvantages though such as not having access to the breast care nurses as they didn't have any information on my treatment they were unable to answer any questions. I also didn't meet anybody else going through treatment at the same time which may have been beneficial to provide support. In some respects I felt quite isolated having my treatment where I did so I can totally understand your concerns.  However, if faced with the decision of whether to go privately or through the NHS again, I would definitely go private. Good luck with whatever you decide. xx",
