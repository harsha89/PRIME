    "Content": "Hi Steve I am not an expert, and I am in the process of chemo, second one this Friday.  I have 6 to endure before the surgery to reduce the tumour.  However from chats with individuals face to face, chat with nurses and doctors and also reading about chemotherapy.  I concluded that it cures / kills cancer cells in the body, especially microscopic one, it is the only treatment I believe that exist now. I have an early stage tumour but grade 3.  I haven't had any strong side effects yet, except some insomnia but that can be fixed.  Lots of people I saw in clinic are coping with it and lots of people say it si durable.  I am a vain person who likes to look best at all time and I am feeling positive about it from what I have seen.  What we have to remember is no matter what you go through during the chemo is at the end you can be cured and everything will go back to what it was.  I go to support groups and all the ladies that have trough it look absolutely fine and very healthy.  I feel there are lots of negativity around it.  I am sure some people go through tough time during the chemo, but alo some other people cope well and side effects are not too bad.   I eat lots of food that boost immune system including all types of seeds especially dark one and I think they are helping me.  Also I walk lots and keep enjoying my life.  I believe I am going to be cured and that's the most important thing, although I have to face making decisions To end this, am basing this on my own experience, so I hope not offend anyone and wish everyone best of luck and a lovely Christmas. Thank you laila",
