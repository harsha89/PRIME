    "Content": "Heather, hello this is the first time I have replied to anyone on here. I have been reading lots of messages over the past three years. I to feel exactly the same way as you I felt I needed to let you know you are not alone with these feelings and emotions. I was diagnosed in dec 2011 with breast cancer stage 3 , and by april 2012 I had undergone three operations the final being a mastectomy. I started chemo but could only cope with two cycles as the side effects were to great to deal with. I was offered an alternative but felt I would have the same effects which were clearly dangerous for me. So my oncologist put me on Herceptin for twelve months which caused sides effects which I managed to deal with on a daily basis. Also I was put on Tamoxifen! I knowÂ  I need to stay on this drug for five years but the side effects are so hard to deal with, hot flushes day and night, fatigue, blurred vision, and so so painful muscles and joints I could carry on but I'm sure you get the idea. But it's opened my eyes today to realise others are feeling the same way. I today had to visit my oncologist for my twelve month check up and I really opened up to how I'm feeling and this is thanks to you that I can start to let others know how I feel about coping with this. I also have been diagnosed with a net tumor in my pancreas which has been under investigation for a while as well. But it's having some quality in your life that is so important, please stay strong think of one good thing each day to try to do, that's what I try to achieve. Melanie x",
