      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I had a lump removed and SNB.  I waited about 3 weeks before they started chemo. It does improve but takes a while.  I have only just stopped wearing a night time bra that minimised movement when I turned over!  Sports bras were my best option as there is no lace or anything decorative to irritate the scar site.  Im still swollen after about 7 weeks but it is slowly going down and the hard lumps seem to be disappearing, albeit taking their time!  Hang in there, they DO start to feel better! Good luck with the rest of your treatment! Karen xx",

      "Content": "Just wanted to remind people that Trevor Sorbie offers a free wig cutting and styling service to all of us that are or have lost their hair through chemo.  I had an appt with him a few weeks ago at his Brighton salon before mine started to come out.  He took us to the   ' wig shop ' and  helped and advised on choosing the wig, basic style, colour etc with an eye on how he would cut it to suit me back at the salon.  Back to the salon and spend ages cutting, trimming and styling to actually suit my face.  All free of charge because of the charity he has set up after a family member suffered hair loss through breast cancer chemo. I think he normally charges about £200 for a normal cut! What a lovely man, so kind and understanding!  If you are lucky enough to live near one his salons, give them a ring and ask about an appt!  Well worth doing and a huge confidence boost at a time when you really need it.  mine is called miranda and she now has her own social diary.  Everyone that has seen her has tried her on and wants to borrow her for special nights out - making a small donation each time with the proceeds going to breast cancer obviously!!  the wigs started from about £90 but they knock the VAT off or you can take your own!  Hope this bit of info helps someone out there!

      "Content": "Hi clarets12, I am day 15 after second FEC and yes, its doable.  Some side effects, most of them fairly minor and annoying but keep a list of everything after your first session and go through it all with your oncologist before the 2nd session so that they can tweak your meds and minimise everything.  It is amaing how quickly the time goes once it is underway and you feel like you are actually doing something positive to fight the battle. I think the worst part is sitting around waiting for things to happen, appts with doctors, treatment plans etc. And yes, that is the scary time. Feel free to PM if you need to but keep in touch here - so much help, support and advice - it really does help! They are all a great crowd!! Karen xx",
