Everyone is so nice here.   I've had to stop work for a while and that's a scary one being self employed with no partner.  I've contacted the Maggie and will hopefully see the Welfare Officer soon to see what help I can get.   Dreading Thursday's large volume biopsy.. Can anyone tell me about it please ?  Karin x",
