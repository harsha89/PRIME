I am off to Cyprus in the early hours of Saturday and will be gone for 17 days. The memorial service for my husband will be next Sunday so I am going to try and enjoy the rest of the time. It will be with all my in-laws who I love to see.",

      "Content": "Annie I do hope that everything will be ok for you. I had my breast cancer years ago and still sometimes I worry it will be back in the other breast. I haven't even been taking my own advice since my husband died of secondary cancer 2 years ago. I have become a bit paranoid about going near doctors. Will your husband be able to go with you to your appointment? Hugs from me xxxxx",
