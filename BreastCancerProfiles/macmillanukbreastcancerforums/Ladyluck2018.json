      "Content": "Hi so sorry to hear your diagnosis. I was told on Thursday that it was confirmed I had BC. All I know is it is hormone positive and it's early stages. I'm going in for lumpectomy and lymph nodes biopsy on Monday so it's all happening really fast. I was very matter of fact when I got told and then when I had to tell colleagues on Friday and do handover notes. I wept today for the first time since I got the results in M&S changing rooms today while trying on zip up sports bra for post op.",

      "Content": "I have been super quick, I'm in Glasgow. I feel like I had a curveball chucked at me as I didn't even know i had a lump. I had a leaky right nipple that was itchy and they found the lump 9 days ago. I've been told they take the lump, tissue around the lump and a couple of the lymph nodes. Apparently the ultrasound isn't always clear on that front. I won't know until 10 days after op if I need chemo but at the very least it will be 3 weeks of radiotherapy and hormone meds. I hope your wait isn't too long and you are right about this place being really supportive xx",

      "Content": "Thanks did you return to work while you were waiting for results? I'm not even sure how I feel, everyone says how happy I must be feeling. Obviously i am really glad it hasn't spread but I actually feeling i am ready to crash. Part of me thinks I should pull myself together and get on with things once recovered from this op, but I feel like I am not in a good place emotionally. I don't even know if any of that even makes sense?",

      "Content": "Had my lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy on Monday. Yesterday i got called up the hospital. It was a 2.5 cm grade 3 tumour but they got it all. Waiting to see an oncologist who will do an oncotype dx test to assess likelihood of cancer re-occuring. This will determine if I need chemo before radiation. Anyone else had this test done?",
