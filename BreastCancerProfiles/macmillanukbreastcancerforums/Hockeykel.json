      "Content": "Hey there, I used the cold cap and my hair thinned quite a bit, but before I started I had it cut into a pixie style crop, and so it made it easy to cover any thinning areas. As someone has mentioned the first 10/15 minutes are the hardest. With it being like an intense brain freeze that you can't get rid of. Positive mental thoughts and imagining a happy place can help you through this, it certainly did for me. Be prepared to feel cold, I always made sure I wore a nice thick jumper and the nurses gave me a blanket and they did have some microwaveable heat bag things to use too. I did dread it in my last couple of sessions, and considered not using it, but it was worth it. The fact that I didn't lose all my hair kept me going, and had a big impact on how I felt.  It doesn't work for everyone though, and people have different degrees of success with it, but you won't know unless you try :-)  Good luck and find your happy place x",

      "Content": "Hi I just wondered if you had been offered a skin sparing implant? I'm 32 and was worried about the emotional impact of a mastectomy, but with the implant it has been so much easier. I don't know if that's something they can offer because of your size, but looking at myself after the op was a huge relief, as the scares weren't as big as I thought. Just don't look at any pictures on Google, everyone is different, and when you build up in your head what it's going to look like you could well be pleasantly surprised with the end product. Also a heart shaped cushion is fantastic support, mine was a big help. I had physio as soon as I could and she suggested that once my wounds had healed to start rubbing moisturiser/bio oil into the scar, but really rubbing it in to soften it up and reduce the appearance (I hope that makes sense). Best wishes and keep your head held high, if you let them, the scars can become a symbol of your strength and perserverance to overcome adversity, rather than a symbol of pain and upset. ",
