      "Content": "I am new to the group. diagnosed in October. tumour removed november and test on lymphs. 2 weeks later was told need another op to remove lymph nodes. not told how many. or maybe was and did not take it all in. I am having op on the 18th Dec. 4 days time. so will know more then. been told the tumour was aggresive. will start chemo and also told radiotheraphy in the new year. feeling nervous and worried. but suppose its normal to feel like I do. I am lucky I have supportive family. last op I had they had to keep me in recovery for some time as my blood pressure hit the roof. I am now on the clexane injections as I was on warfarin for a Brain tumour I had 12 years ago. I am all clear with that. but got to stay on warfarin for life.",
