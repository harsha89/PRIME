      "Content": "Hello I started this thread and have taken some time to read and think about some of the replies. I particularly loved the article http://www.cancercounselling.org.uk/northsouth/extra4.nsf/WebResClient/1761049276601BD68025735B00604834/$FILE/article3.pdf I have sent this to myself and indeed may send it to my family and close work colleagues It is early days for me. I am so pleased I have found that I am able to join this group and know support is always waiting when I need it. I also hope I can share and help support others I hope with all the strength left in me that things will work out for me. So my family don't loose a daughter,sister, wife and mother I know it can happen as it does and has happened to close people I know. But for now I am here, fairly healthy and want and need to make the most of life . Making memories for those around me and myself We have a great healthcare system in this country and they have many tools in their tool bag if needs be they can bring them out again I have learnt some key things Give myself time Learn to live with the different me not spending all my energy trying to get back to the old one Accept how life is now Don't let myself feel alone as there is help if we raise our hand Thank you all so much for taking the time Xx",

      "Content": "Chemo done Surgery done Radiotherapy done Herceptin until Feb 2014 Done everything I have been to,d to do People say I am brave? People say I have done well ??? What else can you do appart from do thoes things ? People around me assume I am all done and dusted, well done they say, you must be so relieved it's over ... Some even believe in their worlds for their benefit I imagine that I have the all clear now. Back where I was 12 months ago and now ... ....Well here I am on my well deserved ,end of horrible 12 months.... holiday This was to be my DONE it thank goodness it's over time. Line in the sand, rest up , reflect, move on in whatever way i can taking into account all the things that I have experienced , the best way I can. Hopefully a better person with a new way to look at life etc etc. la bla Yes I am less tired Yes my scars are healing Yes I actually have days where for most part my legs don't ache, I don't feel on another planet !! However ... As I fast approach the end of my 4 weeks I wonder when are we survivors ? do I say ... I had BC I have BC I am a BC survivor If I am to have checks every 3 months for 2 years and then apparently for the rest of my life I need to do thorough checks with herceptin + ....how do I manage what I am ? It has been a right hard ride there are no two ways about it, but I keep going, I work, I socialise, I try my very best to keep my very low moments to a minimum. Alowing myself time to cry, feel down and sorry for myself . I have even kept a journal and from reading it i know I am coming through it at a steady pace. You cannot forget it as then then a pinch of your port or the numbness of your arm after surgery will remind you You can't think about it all the time as life moves on and keeps your mind distracted , and only to experience the tummy churning feeling when you remember again each and every day you wake up Just for a flicker ... When I buy something or look at my credit card expiry date... Where will I be then in 2015 or 2016 So how to cope with this next phase.... Not so many appointments coming through the door for these symptoms Hugs to all you special ladies who didn't ask to be in this club Xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone I wanted to ask how or if anyone has found a way to deal with people's reactions I was diagnosed in September and and nearly there with my chemo and will shortly start surgery and radiotherapy From the very start it became so clear to me who was able to deal with my diagnosis.friends, work colleague and family all showed different ways of how or indeed if they could support.me I know that some people are not able to deal with the BiG C as I guess they would call it BUT ....along side being humbled by some people's unexpected empathy and caring I have found it really difficulty to know how to feel about some close (so I thought ) friends who have completely distanced themselves from me. I have explained to everyone along this journey that I am still me and this is how I feel. I still work I still socialise when I can When I come closer to the end of all my treatment would we judge pick up where we left off ? Was on fact the friendship more once sided and I never noticed ... And so on I guess this can be viewed as one of the leanings of how this changes your life but it still hurts and it's one of the things I think of a lot as its a bit upsetting and a bit upsetting not knowing how to move on Any others experienced this and how to deal with it' when your emituonslly empty !!",

      "Content": "wow ... never posted to this site before and as you can tell my first post was done late at night when i just needed to talk to somone .... so i joned and posted all within the hr ! I thought I would check on the site to see if anyone had replied after my day at work and saw that all of you took the time to share your experiences ... It is so comforting to know that I am not alone feeling like this, I read a lot of stories where everyone talkes about  so much support and friends family etc  they are all  praised as being such a strength during the whole journey but not having read anything about how you feel when you dont get some of the support you maybe hoped for in some area's and how that feels was something new for me to read Thank you to all of you that took the time to share your experience and feelings I dont feel alone so much now I am still swaying on how I will react when the time comes that these people do cross my path in the future as I am no doubt they will.  A - Be honest and say I am sorry I do not know how to react to you now as I dont understand how you fit or fitted into my life because of how the past year has gone B - Just go with the flow and learn where to put my energy and focus as this is a life changing experience for me Perhaps when I am stronger after everything has finished i will just know how to deal with it all food for thought thank you everyone x        ",

      "Content": "Hello Dawn I have had 12 x taxol and 3 FEC my last one yesterday I don't have a friar tuck but I have a very thin top parting . I am so sick of my thin hair and it is so short I have always thought when I get past my last cold cap I planned on shaving it off to 1\" and starting again. Bit like the end of a mark in time and cleansing !!?? Does it sound mad to it ? Nurse said yesterday she has never known anyone want to do that !! But to me it's like a clean up :-) Anyway I have coloured my hair twice using home colour and my oncologyst said it was fine t colour it I have washed it with normal Pantene shampoo I have been to dentist and had a filling and I have orthodontic braces because I didn't want them removed when diagnosed as it felt like a backwards step I have shaved using a electric shaver ad advised by my nurse Cut your nails ? I have bit stopped cutting my nails and been using Sally Hansen miracle cure all the way through :-)",

      "Content": "Hello Can I ask if this has happened to anyone and should I be worried about the effectiveness .... After getting through 12x weekly taxol and then moved onto 3 x cycles of FEC when I arrived yesterday they said they would be reducing the epirubicin pharmacokinetics by 1/4 (the red devil) I was put on 3 intense cycles of FEC instead of the 4 as my oncologyst said he wanted to do an intense treatment as I have not yet had my tumour removed and I seemed to be doing well on the taxol so far They started me on taxol and herceptin as soon as they discovered I had herceptin + because they were having trouble locating the tumour but cancer cells were found in the limo in my lymph node. They have since found my tumour after 3 MRI and one pet scan and they are trying to shrink it before surgery now I really struggled with the 2 x FEC cycles and after the last one of 3 days bed bound and 3 days sofa bound I asked it they could maybe give me more steroids to help me get through Now I feel worried because maybe it won't be as effective and I should have stopped bleeting and got o with it :-( They said they won't do another cycle so guess I should try and not worry and leave to to them as they are the experts right ...? Hope you ladies are all doing ok When I was laying in my bed yesterday I was thinking of all my new virtual friends :-) x",
