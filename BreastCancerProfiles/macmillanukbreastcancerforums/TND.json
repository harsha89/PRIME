    "Content": "I can top that, went to see my GP on Tuesday, after plucking up courage, I am 5 months after surgery and complications, and now suffering from very very bad depression, I told him everything, he asked what I thought was causing it, d'uh, probably the knife that went in my brain, he then rounded it off with : Do you not think that you are Lucky ! This threw me so much I forgot to raise the permenant headaches that have started. Thats the last time I ever see that idiot again, this is the clown who I had to argue with for a sick note last year, I went back to work feeling so ill, I wrote a goodbye letter to my wife just in case, because I felt something bad was going to happen. 5 months later I had Brain Surgery. I know people sometimes struggle when faced with someone who is recovering from or has cancer, but for a Doctor in these times to say that to someone who is suffering is beyond crass. The next day I had a terrible emotional incident with a family member, I am talking to the hospital now, and going for an MRI scan next week, problem is my sick note runs out soon and this idiot will no doubt think I am fit to return to work.",
