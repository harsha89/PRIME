    "Content": "hi, regarding side effects to arimidex, i have just been taken off this treatment and am being put back on tamoxafen. i had an awful reaction to arimidex every month, diarrhoea like i have never experienced - it was like iodene coloured water and i just felt so ill i just laid in bed all day could not read or watch tv, the worst was 5 days (quick way to loose weight) this went for 5 months until we decided it must be the tablets so my oncologist has agreed and is putting me back on tamoxafine. fingers crossed.
