    "Content": "Hello Dash I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer in the lung after just finishing 7 rounds of chemo for an HER 3 tumour in the breast. I had thought my next plan was a lumpectomy but that seems to be now on the back burner. How did they do your lung biopsy and removal of the lung tumour? Now it is out, does this mean your lung is cancer free and what has happened about your breast tumour? I have a meeting at the hosp to discuss treatment going forward. Your input and experienceÂ  would be so valuable. Thank you.",
