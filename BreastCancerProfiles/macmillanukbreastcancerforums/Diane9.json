      "Content": "Hi, new on here although I have been reading the posts since being diagnosed in March this year with grade 2 IDC + positive lymph nodes. Had 3 x FEC and 2nd T today. Had an allergic reaction to the T today after about 20 seconds of it being administered, had a bit of a cough followed immediately by very tight chest and difficulty breathing. Very scary but the nurses and Dr reacted in seconds and it was quickly under control and back to normal in 40 mins. I had antihistamines for the reaction and oxygen, ventolin and sabutamol. After an hour they tried again but administers it over 2.5 hours instead of the normal 1 hour. Just wondered if anyone else had a similar reaction? Love to you all, it's such a difficult road, but travel it we must. X",

      "Content": "Hi Melbed Good luck for next week, hopefully you'll be fine. The staff said they hadn't had a reaction for quite some time but I was the second one in 2days! Like buses eh? The Dr explained that I didn't react yo the 1st Tax as the body didn't know what it was but as soon as it recognised it yesterday it said, no thanks and shut down. Please don't be alarmed though as I don't think it's very regular but the staff are fully aware it can happen and we're absolutely excellent and in no time I was back to 'normal'. They re administered the Tax but at a much slower pace and I've been fine since. Enjoy the beautiful weather this weekend and take care of yourself. xx",

      "Content": "Hi G & J Yes it was early but I'm still in bed now though! Yes 1st Tax was fine, day 5-9 had very aching legs, day 11-16 sore hands, the 18-21 peeling skin. FEC was ok apart from days 1-4 when I couldn't seem to stay awake more than a couple of hours at a time! Dr explained yesterday that 1st session was ok because my body didn't know what Tax was, but as soon as it recognised it yesterday it said No, no, no and shut down. Shows my immune system is still working properly. Staff were excellent and fully aware this could happen so were right on the ball. Had anti histamines then re-administered the Tax over 2.5 hours and was fine. No herceptin, Next step is surgery :(( then Rads and hormone therapy. So a way to go still but I'm hoping the rest of the journey will be a doddle compared to chemo. Will enjoy the beautiful weather albeit in the shade. Have a fab weekend too. Xx",
