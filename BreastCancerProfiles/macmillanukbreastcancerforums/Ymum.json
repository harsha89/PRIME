      "Content": "Hi, I finished my chemo at the end of July this year and have also completed radiotherapy.  I am still suffering a bit of numbness in my toes and balls of feet and this is making my feet sore when I go walking which I am doing to keep up my spirits and energy. Has anyone else suffered this and found a good solution? I was thinking of buying some gel insoles in the hope they might work. Any tips will be gratefully received, Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Rach, I asked for a Picc line to be fitted as no one had offered it,  and it was the best thing I did after having problems with my veins. Had it fitted for chemo 4 out of 6 and wish I had it from the beginning. It didn't hurt to be fitted, and I can't feel it there. The weekly flush is quick and painless, and nice to get clean dressings on. I put a cut off sock over the dressing to disguise it, people think it's a running band and comment how trendy it looks!! Good luck with it X",

It settled down after a week and I can't feel anything now, so glad I asked for it to be fitted. It was fitted on my non surgery side. Hope yours settles down very quickly and your checks are all good, Take care ",
