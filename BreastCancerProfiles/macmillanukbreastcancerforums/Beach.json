    "Content": "Hi all, my mum has been diagnosed with BC and we have just found out the cells are also in her spine and hip bones. I'm not really quite sure what to say on here, I'm absolutely petrified. Mum hasn't shed a tear and I'm worried she is in denial, and my dad is in a very dark place. We are waiting for an appointment with the specialist to discuss next steps but it maybe a week or two before the appointment, why doesnt anything seem like an urgency it's always a waiting game.  Mornings and evenings are the worst, the thoughts that run through my mind are crazy. ",
