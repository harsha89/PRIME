    "Content": "Hi Tina, Just saw your post re Avastin.  My Mum is part of a trial (NHS) for the use of Avastin in early breast cancer (stage 2, lymphnodes also affected), she's getting it with her first 4 (of 6) chemo treatments. Mum's platelet count was too low to go ahead with the 3rd chemo last week but they still went ahead with a 1/2 dose of Avastin, doesn't really seem to come with any side effects as such, Mum always goes a bit pink, like she's blushing, for the day or so afterwards but so far, so good!! Mum's not on the forum but if you have any specific questions, I'm happy to ask her. Good luck! C x    ",
