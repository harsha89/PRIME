      "Content": "I went to my Gp yesterday with a breast lump and now have to wait for my fast track appointment at the breast clinic . I have had the lump for 3 months and only told my husband the day before my Gp appointment. I spent that 3 months thinking I was imagining  the lump so expected the doctor to say nothing to worry about came as a shock to think she could feel it although said she thought it was smooth and mobile. What does this mean? I\u2019m 59 years old and have bc in my family on my mothers side of the family ( aunt and grand mother)  I\u2019m trying to put a brave face on at home as my husband is a real worrier and don\u2019t want to cause him stress.",
