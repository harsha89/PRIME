      "Content": "Hello......have been reading this site many times and only today decided to join in ....you all have helped me soooo much in this chapter of my life. As you can see I'm finished with active treatment and moved on with living but still read your posts...just this Jan I decided to cancel all follow up appointments with surgeon and oncology team and really 'move on'.. Well Sod's law!! This last week I can feel a kinda thickness in my infraclavicular area on affected side ....real fatigue ongoing....woke Â one night with real pain in chest area ,kinda ribcage but subsided by morning..last CT scan was last Aug...was going to leave it for a couple of weeks to see how things go before heading to GP..I'm 47 ,was 45 at original diagnosis... Was wondering what your thoughts are ,would really value your opinion x",

      "Content": "Hello again....well after holding off a little to see if swelling subsided I did actually make an appointment with GP...he didn't even ask any questions,took a look and refereed me back to breast surgeon..that was last Monday...got letter today re appointment for next Thursday. im a little annoyed with GP as he didn't consider any other possibility,e.g. Thyroid or something..just bounces me back the oncology route ...I thought we were the ones NOT to jump to conclusions!! anyways thanks for the replies and I hope everyone coping well with their own situations x",
