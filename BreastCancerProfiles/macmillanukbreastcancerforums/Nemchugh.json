      "Content": "Hi there, I am in the same position as you are except I think I have a different type of cancer. I was diagnosed in 2012 with BC Her2 positive, high progesterone, high oestrogen, very aggressive but stage 1 only. It was only 1cm long. I found it very early but now it is back on top of my implant. I found out only on Monday and they did a biopsy on the lump and it definitely has high hormone levels again. I am now waiting for results of weather it is Her2 positive again. I might be able to avoid chemo if it is Her2 negative. Wish I had more positive news for you but mine is cancer again. I just hope yours isn't. Good luck. xx Keep me update on how yours goes. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Clair. I just cried and didn't know what to do. What helped calm me, a fellow anxiety girl, was that I pictured God holding my hand through every thing. I have always thought that someone was watching over me from above. I found my cancer at Stage one and was very lucky to find such a serious cancer so early. I have always thought of my great gran as my gardian angel. Watching over me. These simple things will help you through it. Many cultures believe their ancestors watch over them. Keep positive and focus on the good things you have to look forward to in every day life. The small blessings. If anything this horrible cancer teaches us to appreciate the little things in life. Good luck with the rest of your treatment. You are strong and you have support and you can do this. Xx",

I had one the day before each Chemo session as a motivation for the next day. It was like my thing and everyone at work knew it was important to me.  Find something fun and motivating to do the day before your Chemo sessions.  Sending strength xx",
