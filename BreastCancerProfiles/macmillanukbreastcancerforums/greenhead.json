      "Content": "Hi Femera will most likely not be prescribed as it is the most expensive at around £88 a pack according to one pharmacist I spoke to, however according to many on this site Sandoz is made by the same company with the same fillers and ingredients and at around £8 is more obtainable usually by Boots on a special order.",

      "Content": "Hi Totally agree about the running around bit! I had to go from GP  to bc nurse to specialist nurse to oncologist all with different views on  different brands having different effects. Oncologist suggested it may all be down to a placebo effect when women report a better reaction to a different brand! Maybe if he had to take Letrozole and experience the side effects for himself he may come to a different conclusion! They kept saying they would \"sort me out\" when I telephoned to ask for help in changing brand but did not get back to me so I took matters into my own hands and after trying various pharmacists who said they could not get me the brand I wanted went to Boots. Thankfully after some delay they were able to get me Sandoz on their specials delivery. Hoping this works better for me after reading good reports on this site. Primary care was great -the op-the radiation but the follow up or rather lack of it has knocked my faith in the professionals. Come on oncologists do some proper research into Letrozole brands and give us the information we deserve. We are grateful that our lives have been saved but we also would like to have as good a quality of life as possible for however many years we have left.  ",

      "Content": "In reply to argymargy:I do understand the pharmacists point of view, However what I do not understand is why after all the good and expensive treatment we have had from the NHS we are then subjected to market forces for the medication that can prevent the cancer returning with all the extra cost to the NHS a reoccurrence would entail. I believe Sandoz which is a generic of Femara costs about £8 a strip and Femera ten times that much, I was offered Femara prescription after I could not tolerate other brands but on learning Sandoz was the same I decided to take Sandoz brand precisely to save the NHS the extra cost. I also found my GP and even my oncologist was unaware of the problems different brands can have for different people and also with the problems I had obtaining the brand that works for me, Obviously there needs to be a lot more information and education out there for all our sakes. So thank goodness for this site. It appears that both patients and pharmacists are missing out. There needs to be a smoother process between chemical companies, wholesalers, pharmacists and the patients. More joined up thinking needed but unfortunately great as our NHS is this is where the NHS appears to fall down.",

      "Content": "Hi Binkybert. Letrozole is made by different companies and therefore there are different brands. If you look on the packet it will say something like Teva or Sandoz or many other names. The drug that was first made with letrozole as its ingredient was Femera then other companies produced their brand of Letrozole and therefore they are all generics-not the original drug. Different people find different brands suit them but all have side effects such as you are experiencing. I was originally on Teva but changed after a few months as it did not suit me and the one I have now suits me better but I still have side effects-just not as bad. Side effects are the trade off I guess. All the brands have letrozole as their main ingredient but it is the fillers and binders they use that are different and some are tolerated better than others by individual people. I think it takes time for the body to adjust to any drug and the anxiety and stress you are experiencing possibly has a lot to do with what you have been through and not just the drug. However I have no medical training just speaking in the context of my own experience. I still have aches and pains and sleepless nights and some hot flushes but the brand changed helped. Speak to your nurse or doctor for their advice. There are also other drugs instead of letrozole but I think it has been found to be the most effective. Hope this info helps and good luck for the future",

      "Content": "I have the same problem. My husband took in my prescription and was told their supplier could no longer get Sandoz. I will try again on Monday as I can not abide the other brands and I do not see why I should suffer many of their worst side effects seemingly because the pharmaceutical suppliers tend to buy the cheapest brands. All other chemists appeared to have the same answer no Sandoz brand. It is annoying enough to have go through radiation and operations and then to find our lives made more difficult than they need be. Boots have always been very good so far so I hope they can break the deadlock soon. ",

      "Content": "Argymargy I have a prescription for genric  letrozole, My GP specifies the brand and therefore that is what I am given, Yes many generics are well tolerated but many are not by individuals and therefore need something tailored to their needs, Also all medicines have some side effects some much worse than others for some women. Have you personal experience of taking this drug? If so and you tolerate it well then I an happy for you if not then you need to read  many of the comments on this site which show some women are having real difficulty with their treatment. I am supposedly cured of my breast cancer but have to take letrozole as I am ER positive and that is what cancer cells can feed on and return hence the recurrence comment, Believe me if I did not have to take it I would be very happy as even the generic I take impacts my daily activities, I will be on this drug for five to ten years so I think I have the right to obtain a brand regularly that allows me to have a reasonable quality of life while I am taking it. Some previous generics made me quite ill. All have the same drug letrozole but it is the binders and stabilisers that can make the difference for some women. Finally many tolerate different generics, Many do not and  either suffer in silence, give letrozole up and take the risk of the cancer returning or like me search for the brand that has the least impact on their quality of life. Is that too much to ask? From Greenhead.",

      "Content": "Hi, A relation of mine has had a similar problem re bile after radiation damage after treatment for cervical cancer. Apparently it is something to do with bile reabsorption or lack of it and there are several different treatments that can be tries including tablets also change of diet etc. A specialist in this is based at The Royal Marsden I believe so may be worth contacting them. I too have had a gall bladder removed and since having treatment for breast cancer have had difficulty with diarrhoea. Not sure what meds you are on for the cancer if it is leprozole changing brand helped me. I was on Teva now on Sandoz and much better but still occasional bowel probs.  I am not medically qualified just speaking from personal experience and trying to be helpful.",
