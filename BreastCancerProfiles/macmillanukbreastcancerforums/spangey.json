    "Content": "Hi, How are you doing now? i also had a mastectomy on 23rd and know where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s kind of surreal isn\u2019t it.  I felt like slicing it off myself for the three weeks before the op, I think afterwards I mainly felt relief at \u2018having done something\u2019 (or at least done to me, I didn\u2019t actually slice it off!). For me the drain was the worst part, it pulled a lot and I kept forgetting it was attached to me!  I had it removed on Monday, I had asked if it was the end of the drain going 3 inches into my cleavage but told no, that must be scaring as it would be very unusual to go that far.  Guess what, after it was removed and I came down from the ceiling the \u2018scarring\u2019  was gone and nurse very apologetic. Once the pain had subsided though, I felt great but the next day, not so great and quite tearful, which I had only been at the diagnosis. in short, it seems to me ups and downs.  I am now waiting results on the sentinel node biopsy and telling myself well, if it has spread, well I must get on with the treatment, simply because there is no other choice, but I\u2019m still dreading it. I had an two invasive ductal measuring nearly 6  cm combined as a very narrow path between.  How I didn\u2019t find it before I did is beyond me, I feel quite stupid. So I haven\u2019t so far had any other treatment. Well, I do hope you are recovering well.  I ordered a knitted knocker and even received it before my op...it brought a huge smile to my face and I find it better than the softie.  It\u2019s a charity that volunteers knit (or crochet, but these are harder) and send them to you.  It\u2019s fabulous-google them and hopefully like me it\u2019ll make you smile!!!",
