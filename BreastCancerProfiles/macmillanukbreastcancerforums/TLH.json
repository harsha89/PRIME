      "Content": "Hello everyone! I was diagnosed yesterday with IBC and due to start chemo next week. I'm being treated outside the UK, in Luxembourg so not sure yet what sort of support there is here. I'm only 43 and have two small children, aged 3 and 5 so am SO scared about this. Can anyone give me any advice? Many thanks! x",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa I just wanted to update you on my first chemo. I was terrified, as you were, but my husband has been fantastic throughout this and he came with me. He's coming to all my chemos. I was booked in for 11 am and the cancer nurse came to see me and settle me in. It wasn't as scary as I'd imagined and was over pretty quickly. I've been lined up for appointments over the next week for injections for white blood cells and I'm also going to have something inserted near my collarbone which allows the chemo, bloods etc to be done intravenously there rather than going through my veins each time. This is because I'll be having treatment every three weeks for about a year, for immune therapy. I think that's what she said anyway! Thank you for your best wishes. It's really appreciated. Tina x",

      "Content": "Thank you, Lisa, for such a lovely reply. This has been the longest and worst week of my life but I actually feel lots calmer now. My PET scan was clear as was my blood test. But I do have cysts on my liver which are benign. However, I am having a liver scan on Thursday just to confirm this. I start my chemo on Tuesday and just want to get it underway now so that something is being done. I'll be relieved to be started with the treatment. Luxembourg seems to offer the same treatment for breast cancer as in the UK so I am reassured by that. My Dad has terminal lung cancer (diagnosed a year ago) so it's doubly hard for my family at the moment. Today is the first day that I haven't cried so far and am definitely feeling more positive. Thanks again for your lovely email! Tina x",
