      "Content": "Hi Sally, sorry your having a bad time right now.  I was surprised that your hair fell out so quickly. Is that normal? I had my first FEC 13days ago. No sign of any falling out yet - I just assumed it would only happen after 2 or 3 doses. I have had my hair cut short (mainly so as to aclimatise my 13yr old daughter ) .  I have had a problem with little sores on my scalp but no actual pain.  I always find effervesant co-codamol or paracodal work quickly with most strong pain. good luck - waiting to hear how you do. kate.",

      "Content": "Hi gillian yes if you are having chemotherapy you can apply for a blue badge on the grounds of the side effects of the treatment.  Yes we all feel very guilty about applying for any form of help but there are times when you feel very low and fatigued.  And parking especially at the hospital can often be impossible. Dont feel guilty you will not get it if your not eligible and really its only for a short time to make your life a little easier at this difficult time. good luck with treatment. kate.  ",

      "Content": "I thought I had knocked my toe when my nail started to bruise 2 weeks ago, but as I had no memory of a knock I spoke to my Macmillan nurse who said It is due to the Chemo - I will lose the nail and It wont be the only one.  It has now gone black and is lifting. I have had 5 sessions of FEC with my final session due next week.  Not looking forward to this at all.! Nurse advised - Soak feet in tea-tree oil.   She also said not to paint the nail. -  I would love to know why others are painting theirs and where they heard about it. I will be interested to know how you get on npd - good luck with your journey. Kate  ",
