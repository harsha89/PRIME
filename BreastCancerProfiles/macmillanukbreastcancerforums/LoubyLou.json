      "Content": "Hi, I am in the good position of having completed my 6 FEC-T treatments and 20 radiotherapy sessions (Chemo finished Aug and Radio Oct). I have just had my 7th Herceptin but I cant walk properley and have very stiff legs & knees. If I sit for a while my legs cease up and when I am in bed on a night my legs, feet and hands are very painful. Once I get up and get moving I feel better but I still struggle with the stairs. Is anyone else having the same symptoms? Someone said it could be arthritis? someone else said it could be a side effect of the herceptin? I am seeing the doctor tomorrow but wondered if anyone else was going through the same.",

      "Content": "Well I wasnt on the pregabalin and I havent had steroids for a long time so I am inclined to think it could be the herceptin because our symptons do sound similar. I will let you know what the doctor thinks.",
