I am the same hate not being able to wear the tops that I want or go and buy a n ice lingerie set All the best Let me know how u get on",

On the one hand it would be nice to have two boobs so I could wear what I wanted, but on the other hand they said its gonna take a year before its complete and feel like I've wasted enough time on getting better.  I am thinking about going to keeping abreast meeting on Weds.
