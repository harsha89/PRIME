One good thing about cancer is that you make new friends, or improve old friendships.  Some people don't live up to expectations, but remember you don't know what they're thinking.  They may be scared of losing you, may not know what to say or do, or may even be dealing with their own problems.  Most people are pretty useless at some things, and pretty good at other things.  Also, a big lesson for me (being so independent) was that I had to ASK for help!",

      "Content": "Hello. My situation is very different, but I had a massive struggle with mastectomy.  Massive. A year ago, I had a mammogram.  I was only 49, but had been randomly selected to take part in a pilot for extending mammograms to younger women.  I had widespread DCIS, high grade, in my left breast.  This was no tumour, no symptoms, just a large area of pre-cancerous cells.  I was told I DIDN'T have cancer, but that I had a high chance of developing cancer.  However, they would do a mastectomy, which they called a simple operation, to prevent that happening.  I was booked in for surgery twice, and cancelled twice.  I changed my diet radically, did lots of research.  I thought I could cure myself.  After all, I didn't even have cancer!  I'd never had surgery, had never been in hospital, live alone, am a control freak and very independent, and didn't want to have someone looking after me.  I'd been single for 4 years, had been horribly, horribly hurt, and had just started to think I was ready to meet someone.  My first thought was \"Nobody will want me now!\" I attended the Penny Brohn Cancer Care Centre, which was really useful.  I made a new friend online, who's become a very special friend.  I even travelled overseas to meet up with him.  He'd had cancer, had nearly died, and had survived with his sense of humour intact. Gradually I realised two things.  A mastectomy wasn't the end of the world, and I actually DID have cancer, albeit an early form they call \"pre-cancer\".  Accepting this was huge. I had another mammogram, which showed that the area of DCIS had grown bigger.  I decided to go ahead with the mastectomy.  Facing up to it was hard.  I went home and posted it on Facebook, that I was going to have a mastectomy, and the date of the op.  That way I couldn't back out! I had the mastectomy 2 and a half weeks ago.  It was easy, everything's been fine.  I haven't cried.  I think I had done enough crying and thinking, so I'd really faced up to it and accepted it beforehand.  I decided not to have reconstruction, because that means extra time in hospital, and extra discomfort, and I just wanted to get back on with my life.  I was sick of fighting against something and getting nowhere, and just wanted to move forward.  I can have a reconstruction later if I want one.  I don't think I will, but that's nice to know. At my age, if I meet someone, he won't be perfect, and he won't expect me to be perfect.  That's no longer something that worries me. After the op, it was found that in fact, I did have an area of invasive cancer developing - \"proper\" cancer - but thankfully it hadn't started moving anywhere, and my lymph nodes were clear.  The thing that I'm now facing is that they want me to take Tamoxifen, and I don't want to, and I have to see an oncologist to discuss whether I should have chemo.  I don't want to.  I dread that. I have few friends nearby.  Most are a long way away, many are abroad.  I have no children, and my parents are getting old.  Some friends have been wonderful.  In fact, they've all been wonderful in one way or another, but it's been REALLY hard getting practical support, like finding people to take me to appointments etc. I know my situation is completely different to yours, but I've found talking to other women really helpful - it kind of helps you put things into perspective. I think you need to ask why they are now recommending a mastectomy when they talked about a lumpectomy before.  There must be a reason, and you need to know that.  These people aren't very good at communicating!  The biggest lesson I've learned is that I have to be very assertive to get what I want! Best wishes!!",
