      "Content": "Hello RadDad, what a shock for both of you. I was diagnosed with exactly the same at beginning of May 2013. I had chemo first from Aug to Nov and then mastectomy the day after Boxing Day. Just about to start radiotherapy on Monday 24 February for three weeks. Last year seemed to pass in rather a blur - so many appointments etc. although the chemo made me feel ill, it was only for a few days at the beginning of each cycle, it is bearable, more so if you have lots of love and support from family and friends, which I bet you have! I can now see light at the end of the tunnel, and the good news for me is that they have removed all the cancer. I wish you both all the best with your wife's treatment. Remember it won't last forever, and this site is just wonderful for help, advice or just having a rant! Virtual hugs x",

      "Content": "Hi Kate! I am going in for a mastectomy on 27th December.  My surgeon said I will only be in hospital for one night!! I finished my chemo nearly 3 weeks ago and am just starting to feel human again. They tell me that my radiotherapy will happen 6-8 weeks after the op.  I also have three boys, but my husband and parents are brilliant.  Wishing you all the best!",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, just wanted to tell someone how I'm feeling - my friends and family think everything is fine and I look well, so I don't want to talk to them. I had my chemo last year, finishing end of November, then I had mx just after Xmas followed by rads which finished mid march. I have a constant ache in my shoulder blade and an odd sensation along the inside of my ypper arm which is worse at night. I can't get comfy, am boiling hot with flushes that seem to be more frequent at night, and I can't sleep. I have also started to feel very anxious about things. I need to go back to work as my sick pay finishes in a couple of weeks, but after 10 months off, I wonder if I will be able to cope? Has anyone else felt like me - I think when I was having all my treatment I felt secure but now it's all over, I'm not sure how to deal with things. I had good news after my mx when they said they had removed all cancer, so feel guilty that I feel like this at the moment. Would really appreciate some advice xxxx",
