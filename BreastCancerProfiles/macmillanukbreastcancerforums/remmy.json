    "Content": "Hi Mariemos I too would like to know this Hi everyone! I would like to join this lovely group......I start Chemo in the morning and have no idea what to expect. I'm Grade 3 Er+  HER+ 17mm Tumour Stage 1 I'm post surgery, WLE and 1 Lymph Node removed which was clear. My treatment is going to be 4 Rounds of   Doxetaxel  and Cyclophosphamide with Herceptin Injections for 18 Cycles. Radiotherapy and 10 years of Anastrozole. Is anyone else on this treatment? I would really appreciate someone telling me what to expect and share their thoughts on this regime, it all seems so overwhelming. Great to have you all to talk to just wish it was different circumstances! Much love and light to all, Remmy x ",
