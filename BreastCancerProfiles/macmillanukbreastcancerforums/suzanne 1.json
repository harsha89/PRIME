      "Content": "Hello Kate, I had the SNB eleven days ago, along with a Wide Local Excision (removal of the tumour). I have yet to meet the consultant to be staged so I don't even know how many nodes were removed. I have a wound/scar of around seven cms from the snb, just at the base of my axilla. My other wound is also roughly the same size, across the top/front of my breast. For the first 5-6 days after surgery I felt I had got off very lightly- only tender, not much pain and didn't even need paracetamol! By day seven though, the snb site had got significantly sorer,with some shooting pains going down the inside of my arm and some numbness at the top of my inner arm. I've read on here that this is normal after this op. I also have what feels like a bit of a swelling in my axilla- you will have been told about seromas- I think this is what I have but it's not huge and doesn't give me any trouble or pain. They just reduce on their own unless you get a really big one which can be drained if needs be. You may be injected with a dye which travels to the sentinel nodes- this makes it easier for the surgeon to locate them- it also leaves your breast a lovely shade of blue! This can take some considerable time to dissipate. This, coupled with the bruising results in some wonderful hues which look more drastic than it actually feels. I was showing my breast to everyone and anyone- quite proud of my bruising, I was! Much more interesting that the other Blue Tits in the garden!! I didn't anticipate how totally drained and fatigued I would be, and still am, to a slightly lesser extent. I started driving after a week, just as the pain was getting worse so had to stop that for a few days but am back behind the wheel now. I have my hospital appt on Friday where I will get my 'big results'- whether I need chemo or 'just' radiotherapy,or maybe more surgery too. Well done for getting through your chemo- I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on that. I'm so dreading it. Lots of ladies here all agree it's 'do-able' but I just know if I can do it. Hope this gives you an idea of what to expect. Best wishes, Suzanne x",

      "Content": "Hello Mary, I have  read everyones' posts here, everyday since Sept 13th 2013 when I was diagnosed with grade 3 stage 2b ductal carcinoma.  I posted a couple of  messages but felt quite disconnected from everyone and everything that was being said- I don't know why- it was all relevant. I read your post today and immediately felt a connect with you and what you were expressing. Everything you said struck a chord with me.......the battle to get through the day, just to keep myself clean....... who cares?...... my husband  is an amazing man, so utterly supportive,I am so lucky, I really  don't deserve him. He, however, is the only one I have been able to depend on. Most of my family havn't   phoned or even texted me( we live 400 miles away from all of the family), not even to acknowledge I have cancer. I too finished chemo recently and will start radiotherapy tomorrow. I feel utterly alone, I feel it is such a massive thing I am going through, but no one else seems to see it this way.... I feel so resentful of that fact.... no one else seems to give a shit... no phone calls from friends,except one, Helen to whom I am so grateful for her help.... I must start thinking about returning to work soon. Many of my colleagues I   previously saw as my friends, we supported one another through all sorts of crises...... everyone of them has disappeared since this has happened to me, I truly don't understand why.. there must be something  about me that doesn't deserve friendship and support. Mary, I would love to be able to send you a message of positivity... but i cant. All I can do, is to say how I understand what you are feeling, I think I  feel the same. We must take succour from that basic emotional connect, only we can truly understand the enormity of the whole bloody awful experience that is cancer. Suzanne",
