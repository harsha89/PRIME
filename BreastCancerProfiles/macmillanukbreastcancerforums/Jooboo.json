      "Content": "Oh I'm so with you on this one!! It's so annoying isn't it! So tired and yet can't get into a deep sleep. I've resorted to some mild sleeping pills that the Onc Ward told me to get from my GP after trouble sleeping with Fec1. Tried to do without them last night but that was a mistake - just me and Claire Baldings Ramblings through the night! Very nice but might choose something more boring to download tonight!  Good luck with the sleeps tonight xx",

It's so frustrating isn't it!  It doesn't seem to matter where I am in a cycle but just get no more than 2 hours sleeo at a time with a buzzing awake time in between. Resorted to a sleeping pill last (Zopiclone) which my GP gave me on advice of Onc Nurse and just had a blissful 9 hours sleep with only one wakeful few minutes ... Absolutely dreamy ! Hooe you get a better one tonight  JooBoo xx",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky I was really interested to read your comments, I am FEC 1 day 17 so building myself up for 2nd chemo this Friday and having felt fine for a week I'm now having a low energy day which has rather taken me by surprise.  Also I look as pale as I did for the first few days after chemo 1 too, so I'm having a very quiet restful day and catching up on this forum. I loved your description of how you felt days 1-3 - exactly how I felt last time too!  Hard to describe to others isn't it!  You said you have a yoga for breast cancer DVD - can I ask where you got it or who is it by please? I completely understand how you feel about the hair/wig/scarf thing!  Yesterday my hair started to fall out and today we (hubby and I) are going to cut it off, really really short to start with and then maybe shave... But I'm looking at my diary for next few days and thinking oh no how am I going to cope with going out and meeting friends and family, neighbours, strangers...  Collect my wig on Wednesday and I've practised with scarves but all the same .. it's a very big step! Have courage Smoothie and keep smiling!    (by the way this is the first time I've replied to someone so hope this was the right way to do it?!) Jo ",
