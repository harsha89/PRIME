      "Content": "Hi, I had a skin/nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction on the 17th and then got rushed in for an emergency second surgery on the 20th due to having a blood vessel that hadn't closed. Im really pleased with the reconstruction, however, my breast is currently red and this seems to be a reaction from the acellular dermal sling that is holding the implant in place. Has anyone else experienced this red breast syndrome and if so how was it resolved? I have seen looking online that in some cases corticoides are prescribed and work. My surgeon has said that we need to wait and I am going back on Wednesday for a follow up appointment.  Thanks, T x",
