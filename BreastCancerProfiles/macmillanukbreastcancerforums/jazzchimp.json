      "Content": "I have lost all my hair depsite using the cold cap it started to go before chemo 2 by te tijme I got to chemo 3 it had gone. my hair was very fine. However, I have tow beautiful wigs, I have had people in shops ask me what colours i used on my hair as one is highlighted.. I obviously told tehm it was a wig and they were amazed. I was helpd out by a lady who was trined by Trevor Sorbie adn she ordered what she tought would suit me and i came ot my house and cut them to suit my face.It gas given me so muc confidence. I just wanted to share this.  The web site is www.mynewhair.org there is a list of hairdressers who have had this tranning on the site.  Best wishes to you all. Dee                                ",
