      "Content": "hi all im new to this great site! You all seem to friendly and supportive. just wondering if anyone is suffering with pain following chemo? It was bad enough then but started letrozole 2 weeks ago and it\u2019s worse. I do have osteo arthritis anyway but as well as that pain I now seem to have pain in places I\u2019ve not had it before. Asked GP who said there was nothing he could do. Any tips anybody please? Thanks in advance x",

This latest problem with painful hands especially thumbs and dropsy has started in the past two weeks. I started letrozole on 22nd Feb. I hope this isn\u2019t going to be permanent. Thank you again for your support and advice. s",

      "Content": "Hi R thanks so much for your reply and all of the info. I do have arthritis in knees which I\u2019ve had TKR and also have it in back and hips but prior to chemo I\u2019ve never suffered from any pain in shoulders or hands especially thumbs. It\u2019s quite intense and continual. I\u2019ve also noticed that I struggle with opening jars, cans etc and seem to have dropsy! Very annoying when you keep dropping things over and over again. I mentioned to oncologist who seemed to think that it wasn\u2019t connected to treatment, but I think it maybe as I\u2019ve said I\u2019ve not suffered with it before treatment. Saw GP who didn\u2019t seem that helpful. The oncologist has sent me fir a dexa scan which I\u2019ll get results next week hopefully. I\u2019m concerned now I\u2019ve read people\u2019s comments on letrozole that this is only going to get worse. I\u2019ve an appointment at hospital Wednesday so I\u2019ll mention it again. Thanks again for all of your advice.  S",
