I did get an appointment with my gp but he was on holiday so I saw a locum.  He felt my lymph node and told me to speak to my onc and thought that the rash might be an allergy or stress and gave me some antibiotic cream to apply. Thanks for all of the invaluable advice hopefully all will go well at the onc appointment as its the first one since my treatment finished in April. XXXX",

When I saw my surgeon on Tuesday I asked about my bone scan and she said I didn't need one as the blood test I had said I was post menopausal.  I explained to her that I had a period in January - although I had missed the two previous ones.  I dont really understand what this means.  Is it possible to that I may have two cancers at the same time.  Im really worried. x ",

      "Content": "Hi Im new to this so please bear with me.  I was dx in November (my birthday) with stage 1 grade 1 idc no nodes and had a mastectomy on 4 Jan.  have been prescribed Tamoxifen and probably rads.  Waiting to see onc in 3 weeks. When I found out that I had bc I developed a pain in my back which hasn't gone away and I am really worried as it has moved to my hips,  The hospital and my GP are not concerned and tell me Im just anxious. I have had no scans just blood tests. Sorry to ramble on just needed to vent.",

      "Content": "Hi thank you for all of your advice it was so reassuring .   Just got back from my GP who thinks that the pain in my hips is arthritis (I already have it in my knees!) but I am going to mention it to my onc when I see her. I know that is still early days after my mastectomy but I am still trying to come to terms with what has happened to me.   My sister was dx with stage 3 grade 3 HER2+ tumour the size of a medium egg in 2008 and she has had a totally different attitude towards her dx.  She refuses to let it get to her she has travelled, drunk (so so much) and eaten exactly what she wants goes for her check up's and gets on with it. I suppose everyone deals with things differently. One of my friends who went through exactly the same as me but finds it hard to talk about did suggest that I try acupuncture as it worked for her. Thank you again for all of your wonderful replies.",

I have just read my last post and my comment about my sister.  I wanted to say that I wish I could be more like her because she is the most practical and positive person I know.  She never missed an appointment or complained about her treatment even when she was bald and had a mouthful of ulcers from her chemo. She walks miles every day and says that fresh soothes the soul. She always tells me that everyday we have is a day to celebrate. Julie xx ",
