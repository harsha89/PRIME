      "Content": "Hello, I had a 9cm tumour back in November last year. I had 8 sessions of chemo every 2 weeks which shrunk it to 4.4 cm. Then followed a mastectomy and finally radiotherapy. All my lymph nodes were removed as a precaution but nothing had spread there. I've recently met a lady who had a 10.5 cm tumour. Chemo was okay especially when I could feel the lump getting smaller each week. I've got my annual check up later this month. Not looking forward to it but cross fingers all will be well. You're in safe hands whatever the size and yes \"you will beat this\". Take care, Ceri",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm new to posting on the site but over the last year I've found comfort reading everyone's experiences. Last November I was diagnosed with a 8.8 mm tumour. I had 8 sessions of chemo to shrink it, then a mx followed of the left breast, finally I completed 3 weeks of radiotherapy in August. I've just had an appointment through for a check up in November which I'm assuming is a mammogram of the 'good' one? I'm absolutely dreading it. Convincing myself it's come back and something sinister will be found. Has anyone had a 12 month check up appointment - what happens?! I can't stop thinking about it and my over active imagination is running wild!",

      "Content": "Thank you both for taking the time to respond. I've taken your comments on board and will try not to panic too much. As I've done over the last year - take every day as it comes! I've got my 'look good feel better' session at our local Maggies this afternoon. I've been on the waiting list since April so looking forward to this and it will take my mind off things. Thank you again. Ceri",
