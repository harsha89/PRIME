      "Content": "Yes I have! And I want to share................... It's taken me nearly a year and a lot of wasted money too. I know we are all different but this one works well for me as I have lots of lumpy and sensitive skin under my DIEP reconstructed boob. I've been buying post surgery bras in hope that they would be softer and usually they are fine, but as the day goes on they can feel very tight at the band or under the cups. My new boob is a bit 'under the arm' so this has added to the discomfort as most bras pull me over to the good side and drag on the sensitive one.  These M&S ones seem to be more forgiving and I can wear them all day. You get VAT off at the till too. The only downside for me personally is that they don't cover the mess that used to be my cleavage, but you can't have everything and I may add some lace to correct this problem. The cups are formed so help to even out the fact of one boob being bigger than the other (I don't like wearing my prosthectic, it's too heavy and feels so numb!) , so now I can wear a T shirt and it looks ok. http://www.marksandspencer.com/post-surgery-padded-full-cup-bra-a-e/p/p60086793?mfPartNumber=T331813&carousel=FUNV_RR Good wishes to all of you on here, Sally xx",

I have to wait another week for my surgery, I was all geared up and ready too! Apparently my lump didn't show up on the other tests I've had, (Mammo,Bone scan,CT,) although it can be felt quite easily. I guess the surgeon wants to know exactly what he's dealing with before he operates.

I would have loved a countdown to finishing time or someone to just say 'it's just a few more minutes' as I lost all track of time, and kept thinking it was over, then it started again!

      "Content": "Well I finally came home from the hospital yesterday after a 12 night stay to treat the 3 infections which had lodged in my reconstructed (Diep flap) breast. One of the infections was E. coli . I had 2 surgeries to wash out the bugs and came home with 1 drain still in place. Sadly the boob is very misshapen and slightly dipped rather than full at the cleavage. Most of it is too far round under my arm as well, and gives the impression of just a small boob under my clothing.  (It should be a size 40D but looks about half that) It's still painfully hard in places and I'm hoping this will improve as I can't get comfortable very easily. It seems to fill with pressure, then goes down a little, but too uncomfortable to contemplate a bra. Maybe when the drain is removed I will be able to bear something around my chest but not just yet. I so want to get back to my beloved dance classes, but right now that seems a long way in the future. Hey ho, once I'm healed then I will be facing chemo and more, I have an appointment on Tuesday to meet my oncologist, and I'm just hoping that this setback won't delay my ongoing treatments too much. I'm sorry for my dear husband who has had to listen to all my problems and fears.ive been cheerful for my three boys because I didn't want to spoil their young lives, but I think poor hubby has had to take the strain a lot. Yesterday I cried for the first time since this Cancer came into my life. I think because I have been basically fit and well until now and just moving through the treatments with a goal at the end. Funny how a comparatively small setback can be the tipping point. At least I'm in my own bed now!  Nice to unload a bit, thanks for 'listening' Hope your journeys are going smoothly! Sally",

Back to surgery tomorrow (Thursday) for more cleaning and the poor old boob is now the shape of a big fat squashed donut in ever changing shades of all the most ghastly colours.  I have been contemplating a name for this badly behaved breast-like thing and last night it came to me!

      "Content": "Well! Nine months of relentless treatment came to an abrupt stop last Wednesday after my final radiotherapy treatment. I have a couple of follow ups still to come but right now it's quite hard to get used to the idea that it is FINALLY over! I'm physically not completely 'settled' as my Diep recon boob (surgery was June 2016) still has lumps and bumps that change shape and it's pretty tight around the chest even when I'm not wearing a bra. I think the chemo (FEC-T which finished end of November) has had the longest hangover and the nails which haven't fallen off are still held on with sticking plaster. My hair is coming on well though and instead of my long red hair I have an almost white mini mohawk, only half an inch but I just about can brush it into shape:) I have been told that radiotherapy will keep working away in the areas treated for another two weeks or so. I haven't had a bad reaction to it, just still a bit red and slightly 'rashy' looking. I got a horrid cold this week, maybe my immune system is still struggling, also have developed a beastly horrible toothache, the cause of which has not really been found by my dentist. He prescribed antibiotics and I can't  eat on that side as that's what sets it off. I've worried myself sick about this toothache because I have had two sessions of  IV Bisphosphonates (Zometa) . My dentist and BCN both informed me that I can never have a tooth pulled out ....ever, and that is scary when you are in pain. This is because of a a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw when on Zometa which sounds terrifying. The risk is always there even if you stop the Zometa apparently because it stays in your bones. But then the Zometa can help prevent spread to the bones in post menopausal women so there are pros and cons. So it's over but in some ways it's not over, guess I'm not alone in feeling this. Best wishes to all ladies and gents out there who have been hit by this beastly thing. May your treatment and care be good and successful and your after effects few x (My next mammo and MRI will be in March, my one year anniversary)",

I expect that my immune system is still weak after the treatments. Karen, make sure you have a checkup with the dentist before you have the bisphosphonates as once you've had them your options for any major tooth treatments become very limited. I wasn't alerted to this until after I'd had the first two IVs with bisphosphonates. My third one was cancelled when I reported my toothache and I was sent straight away for a panoramic jaw x-ray and told to make an urgent appointment with my dentist for a checkup and a letter to show the health of my teeth. So I never had the third one and now the treatments will be every six months. I think slippers for Summer is a very practical idea:) Good luck with the rest of your treatments xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Well it's been more than 5 weeks since my Mastectomy and Diep flap reconstruction to the left breast. I posted on here that I went back to hospital for 11 days due to infections in breast. I came out almost 2 weeks ago and still the breast patch (not sure what to call it but where the areola was) is draining a mixture of 'liquid fat' and 'red liquid'. The plastics dressing clinic fitted me with a stoma bag over my breast which although kind of gross, does at least allow me to deal with it without unpeeling the dressing all the time. There is a small stopper which I can undo to empty the bag. I have been instructed to squeeze and press the breast to help the flow of liquid to come out. The doctor told me last week that I'm not out of the woods yet, meaning that although the antibiotics are finished, there is still some infection to be seen. My worry is that how will the skin ever heal if there is constant drainage through the breast patch? How will I ever be ready for chemo? When I ask the chemo question at the hospital I'm not surprised that the answer is 'well you have to heal first'. I guess what I want to hear is 'a delay to chemo won't be detrimental to you in the great scheme of things' Then I could stop obsessing about it........................................!",

After one more physical exam he declared me in the clear and so I think I can now call myself a Neddy (No Evidence of Disease Detected) . I tearfully gave him a hug:) It's been a tough year (WLE, Mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction,then 3 infections and consequently 2 extra surgeries, Chemo, Rads, Letrozole and Zometa...the works!) Resulting in an 'almost' boob but horribly disfigured cleavage from the fat necrosis and some ongoing discomfort with the boob. Also I have some Tinnitus and slight deafness from the chemo, but it's bearable, fingers crossed. But I am HAPPY and relieved it's over and I'm looking forward to good times ahead. I wish all ladies and gents who are going through this S**T the very best to get through the treatment and good luck for your futures. I'm celebrating by heading off to a tap class today then a meal tonight with my lovely husband who has suffered a lot this year too! Cocktails will be on the menu......Cheers! Sally xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, this is a semi humorous post and it helps to keep me busy until my surgery in three days time!  I received a letter today from the Consultant Surgeon who did my WLE and axillary nodes clearance in April. The letter was the standard confirmation in writing of what we had discussed in clinic early May, ie further surgery and recon. He then went on to say that he recommends a \"Competition Left Mastectomy\" and later in the letter to assess my suitability for an \"Abnormal DIEP flap reconstruction.\" I have to admit that with the surgery booked in for 20th June ie in 3 days time, I was slightly disturbed until I twigged that he must have dictated this to a computerised device and the 'Abnormal DIEP flap' should read 'Abdominal DIEP flap' Haven't quite worked out what the Competition Left Mastectomy translates to yet, but as long as I win the contest on Monday I will be happy:) Starting to feel a bit trembly now, having waited 6 weeks for this I can't wait to get it over with! My current mantra is: Keep Calm and Just Turn Up (on Monday)",

      "Content": "Thanks! Looks like you are entering too, so all the best to you on Monday :)  You might like to know that six weeks on from my lymph node clearance, my arm and shoulder are totally fine and I've been back to yoga,tap and belly dance classes for a few weeks.  I have to say that gentle dancing classes (especially belly dancing) are a lot more fun and interesting than those boring exercises the leaflet suggests! They are important of course in the early days, and they work better if you put some music on to do them to.............. xxxx",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies, I took the advice and called them. As helsbels found they told me it classed as routine screening. My insurer is called Get Going and the cost of this single trip for a couple is £44.72. My husband takes Blood pressure pills and I also have underactive thyroid medication and Asthma, plus he is 68 and I am 66 so is probably a reasonable enough price for insurance:) Soooooo looking forward to some sunshine! Best wishes to all, Sally x",

      "Content": "Hi all, I've booked a holiday to Cyprus in May and arranged travel insurance but woke up in the night worrying that I may have misunderstood one of the medical screening questions as follows: \"Are you currently on a waiting list for treatment or investigation? \" (I answered No) I finished my treatment for BC (Surgery/Chemo/Rads) at end of January but I have received an appointment for an MRI and Mammogram in early March which is around the one year anniversary of my original diagnosis.  Do you think these appointments count as a \"Yes\" or a \"No\" to the above question? ",
