      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with TNBC on 31st Dec 14 I am only 38yrs old. I have already started chemo done 4/6 sessions of FEC-t which I expect you will be o.  I had chemo first as I had 2 tumours with lymph node spread so chemo first to shrink before I have a mastectomy in June. My main tumour was stage 2 and has already practically vanished. I will be having radiotherapy after of breast underarm and chest wall as smaller tumour close to my chest nodes no evidence of spread yet but having ct scan next month to check. triple negative is the most aggressive breast cancer but there are good chance nowadays my advice don't Google too much. I'm being tested for for brca gene due to family history of positive I will be opting for double mastectomy If you want me to tell you what I know and offer any advice feel free to message me anytime x              ",

      "Content": "I was asked to consider taking part in a clinical trial if my results come back positive match to the brca gene and because I agreed I was fast tracked and my bloods have already been taken and sent to America. They told me about 3 weeks for results. The trial is really interesting they want to test tnbc patients under 40 that are carriers to take a biological tablet for a year similar to tamoxifen to see if it breaks down the dna and stops cells dividing it's in stage 3 of the trials and so far is really positive that this tablet could be given to high risk patients to prevent reoccurrence. The trial is called olympia. I go to Southampton and thankfully my hospital participates so I may be able to do my bit for research once I am through treatment.  Six weeks today will be my last chemo hooray x    ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I was diagnosed on NYE with Invasive Triple Negative breast cancer which was graded as grade 3. The surgeon sent me for a MRI so that they could check my breasts as the mammogram did not show my tumour, although the ultrasound did so this really threw them. I was going to have a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radio but the MRI showed a 2nd tumour in my chest wall close to the lymph node so they want to know if it has already spread so sent me for a CT scan of my body. Due to this new tumour they are now starting me this friday on FEC-T regime (6 sessions) every 21 days. I go for my bloods and pre-chat today and although I am not nervos yet It hasn't hit home yet what I am about to go through. in my head I am still going to go to work and try live as normal of a life but although I was given a list of possible side affects as long as my arm. i know each person is different. I just want to hear peoples stories about this combination of drugs and any advice would be appreciated. I am only 38 with only my great aunt in the family with breast cancer but they still think I have the gene. Any advise would be greatky appreciated x",
