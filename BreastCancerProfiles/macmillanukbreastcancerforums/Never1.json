    "Content": "I don't smoke or drink. I know people who do who got cancer and plenty who haven't but I don't believe anyone deserves it, which is the implication of 'bringing it on ourselves'.   I've worked extremely hard all my life in a stressful but very worthwhile job. I am overweight,  though - did I deserve cancer? Certainly not, it's just bad luck and a little bad judgement. I know plenty of people much fatter than I and they may well not get cancer but if they do they don't deserve it.  If I was in a plane crash it wouldn't be considered  my fault for flying. Most people have sex - very risky. We have to live and living brings risks. So let's ignore these stupid, judgementally slanted reports, do our best to live healthy lives and survive this awful disease. Guilt is a waste of energy and blame is totally unhelpful. ",
