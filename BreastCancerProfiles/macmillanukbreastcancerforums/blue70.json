      "Content": "Ohhh not good at all smelly cat lady. Since I have been diagonosed I have been up and down on a rollercoaster that have no iformation stopover. My BC could have been diagonosed 4 months earlier as I have the obivious signs and my gp and nurse fibbed me off and I BELIEVED them. I had a 4cm lump before realising that something is seriously wrong. They still thought it was nothing ??? My first chemo was hell. I ended up in ER three times. The second time i was told to go to the hospital as chemo unit had no doctors. No one would see me in ER. I was in pain and on floor sobbing and they still did nothing. The doctor just told me to take paracetamol and put me on saline drip, she FORGOT about me for 2.5 hours. I had to pull the drip out to go look for someone????? It took an oncologist 6 hours to see me that day for a prescription that was done in 10 mins. When I asked him he said oh he thought I wasnt urgent and apologised. I still cry when I think of that day. I never get appointment for my oncologist on time. Whenever I go to an appointment I am told it was cancelled or moved and then they run around trying to find my file and saying sorry is not good enough. I am mad that they never gave me an option to save my ovaries and proceeded without informing me that I have a choice. they could have given me Zoladex??? but no I had to ask them why and was told my cancer is too big and do I really want to bring in a child in my condition.... I havent seen my oncologist in ages and this time if he is not there I am gonna walk out because I am tired of talking to temps. Maybe for you it has been this amazing trip with memories you can cherish. For me this is a nightmare, I am too young and too tired to be messed around. I am going to stand up and shout. I was in hospital last week with high fever, the nurse gave me the medicine and walked off, I kept pressing nurse call and I could see them talking and shouting but no one notice that I have no water to take medicine with. It took andhour before I could get their attention and yes I was in a ward ?? I am still paying for my ensure and paracetamol as my GP appointments are imppossible to get and I have no strength to to and argue with them.I have to look for advice here for my symptoms and I have found some really good one. Should I be grateful for NHS yes I am Should I be grateful for onclogist HELL NO. they choose to be one so do your job properly and efficiently. They are not more imp than me or any other cancer patient. Patient and patience  hmmm there is a reason they are spelt differently. Good luck",

My chemo is kicking in. I need a appointment with my oncologist before my next chemo. The two appointment I have are both useless as they are now and after the chemo. What makes me mad is they are not ready to listen to my symtoms and atleast give me 5 minutes. God help me.",

My hubby was worried so I expalined to him that this is the only way I can see an oncologist and get some antibiotics. If it was my decision, I would like to see a doctor 3-5 days after my chemo however, I dont even get to see my oncologist before my chemo. I have been bounced off the second time now. Its not my fault that I am sick, they are the doctors they should do their jobs properly and stop being so high and mighty.",

      "Content": "Hi Looby So sorry to hear about your diagonses. It is devastating to find out that you have the big C. I was diagonosed on 3rd June. I have the same stage 3, tumer between 2cm to 8cm. The tumor was too big to measure correctly. I am having my 5th chemo tomorrow. I was also on Artimes tiral. My tumor is almost gone and I am hoping for the best. Please think clearly, take on step at a time, you and your family will cry a lot. Just concerntrate on getting all the info you can. I would suggest that you go for a shrink as sometimes it better not to unload on your loved ones. Good luc and you are in my prayers xxx",

      "Content": "  I had a night mare session with my surgeon last week. He expalined the option which are honestly horrific. I am having readiotherapy so I have decided to go for temp implant for a while and see how things go.  The surgeon informed that he will do a full node clearance on left side, which I can understand as I have stage 3 cancer with 2 infected lymph nodes. However the right breast has pre cancerous cell and no node involvement. He is insisting that it will be sentinel node clearance. WHY WHY I cant loose movement in both arms and I would rather have sentinal node clearance on left and nothing on right as they are taking out both the breast. I am very very consufed. My brain is saying that I have gone throught chemo, the lump is gone and there is nothing on right side so I should just have double mastectomy and leave the rest alone. Has anyone has the same thing done and how restricted is their arm movement. Surgeon is also pushing me through LD flap thing (the back muscle) Has anyone had this procedure. What are the risk of having implant just under your skin temp or your chest muscle afterward and do they look look are they painful . Please any help is appreciated, I have another appointment next week and would like to be prepared.   thank you",

      "Content": "The MRI showed 2 infected lymph nodes 4 months ( May 2011) before chemo on my left side. There is nothing showing on right side. The argument I have is these doctors go through procedure, we are just a number.They keep refering to reoccurance. Cancer made me aware of the facts that I wont be living a long healthy life expected by everyone.I will live under the shadow of cancer treatment side effects. I am quite positive and I am hopeful I will be fine. I just dont want to cut up my arms, back and stomach. I have to now decide how much pain and side affect do I want to live with. I can go with Lymphodema on left side but to do both side is madness. I want a relative normarl life and I need advice from everyone here. Any info on lymph nodes infection and temp implants, side effect, how to get a second opinion will help.",

      "Content": "I have a date for chemo now. I am meeting the nurse on Friday and I will start chemo on tues. I am going for a job interview next week so have to cut my hair tues morning as I really want that job and if I have a chance I want to take it. I dont know if anyone will hire someone who is going through full on treatment. I have so many things to organised. Finally got an appointment with my GP so didnt wanted to go there as I dislike them intensely. This could have been diagnosed in Feb or March. I went to see the nurse and she would look at it, told me it was an inverted nipple. Did see one of the doctor however I dont like him at all so refused to show my boobs to him ( he is really stupid, long story) couldnt get an appointment for my GP. I found a lump on 24 May, tried to get another appontment, receptionists were very nonchalant told me to go to out of hour services and some other bs. I was so mad I went to ER and sat till someone saw me. They were very concerned and reffered me to one stop breast clinic, got first appointment which was tues. Almost lost that appointment becuase of GP error, them saying that they havent refered me. I went through so many mamograms and scans, the doctor there did 2 tissue sample and FNA and by 31st may 2011 I was told I have breast cancer possible stage 3. The point is I know it nothing new what I went through, I know that however I have every disease in my family heart problem, blood pressure, diabetes etc but no cancer so I wasnt aware and ready for it. How do you prepare for this???  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I have been diagnosed with breast cancer on 31st May 2011. I had all the test and they are clear. I have stage 3 tumor in my left brest which has spread to lymph nodes (2/3) and pre cancerous cyst in my right breast. I am starting chemo next week. I am so scared. I have no family history and knew no one with breast cancer. I am very healthy and still in shock. Everything is going over my head. I have been told I will have to go through chemo ( resulting in menopause) double mastectomy and radiotherapy. I just want to believe that if I go through all the pain and procedure, cancer will not come back. I havent read anything positive and the survival rate is listed as 60% maybe 5 years. I dont know if I want to go for implant as I have only realized that they wont cut everything off. I wanted to wait 6 months before going for implant or reconstruction. What am I going to do, I still burst in tears thinking I have breast cancer. Doctors are pushing me to go through AVASTIN / ARTEMIS trial however all the articles I have read mentioned lots of side effect, nothing is positive.",
