      "Content": "Hello Chloecat I started to read this thread from the beginning about an hour ago...it has enthralled me, and I was aware all the time I was reading that I soooo hoped you would have posted a reply recently, and then as the thread progressed and you talked of your latest appointment on the 18th June, I just was praying that you had put an update after it.  And you have!!! Marvellous. I so admire your approach and hope to follow at least the 'attitude' of your actions, if not the letter. So..just a quick tale about me....I was diagnosed two and ahalf years ago with a very small lump...noticed a crease in my breast and got it looked into.The lump was 17mms. Very small compared to others. Think it was DCIS (not sure if thats right but it sounds ok to me). Anyway, \\i had a lumpectomy, but I didn't have radiotherapy or chemo. Or tablets afterwards. However, I took a load of salvestrol for a month or so then sort of forgot about it, as luckily there were no other complications I had to think about. Two weeks ago had a mammogram/scan/biopsy. Recurring cancer. Lump the size of an egg. Advised to have mastectomy. Single. Surgeon said I couldn't have double (which I had wanted...not to stop it coming back, but because it seemed to me neater and easier to deal with....and I dont want a single boob...that seems stupid to me). I am nearly 62 and dont have any particular attachment to my breasts. I am a gay female, not straight ...the whole issue around breasts as 'feminine' or sexual attaction for straight males doesn't factor in my life at all.) The Consultant (junior) then talked about breast reconstruction. I was in a bit of a shock about it but listened to all he had to say. Then listened to the breast cancer nurse, who was lovely (less inept that the junior consultant) and described in detail the processes etc. Gave me a leaflet with diagrams too. I have to say the whole process scared me more that the idea of a double mastectomy!!!! First i have to undergo a ten hour operation and months  (more) of recovery time as both the breast and other wound heal. Then, when the breast swelling has gone down, I have to endure another operation on the healthy breast to reduce its size to more or less the same as the cancer boob. Sort of plastic surgery I believe. And then!!!! I can have nipple reconstruction and possibly a tattoo. Up to four op if I choose them, But at least two to ensure that I look the same each side....remember I would look the same each side if I had a double mastectomy....only one op...over and done with. And as far as I can see, the surgeons think this is better than a double mastectomy!!!!   The reason they give for not doing a double is that they feel it wrong to cut off a healthy boob. But funny enough, they dont think it wrong to mutilate the healthy boob so that it can be made to fit with the social stereotype image of how a straight woman should look 'to attract a male', and fit into the stereotypical categories of 'feminine beauty' as women have been nurtured to believe it should be. I am proud of who I am inside, not what encases me outside.  (I know that may be seen as an  extreme viewpoint because the reconstruction seems to be what many women want, but for those of us who dont want it, like me, it strikes the right and appropriate chord) I am having a CT Scan within the next two weeks, and then an appointment with the operating surgeon, once he \"has all the facts\"....then we can discuss it further. Its the first time I will have met him so it should be interesting. Especially to know what 'facts' he considers to be important, and what 'facts' are not. Even before I read this thread I had decided to once again request (isn't it funny how we women have to request from what is largely a male establishment (or at least its ethics stem from that historical place)) a double mastectomy and not go down the reconstructed route. And I will also ask for more time to think about it...even if I am told I can have  the double. I found out last time that the establishment didnt really give me time to think about what it would all mean....in retrospect I felt railroaded....that wont happen this time for sure! I am truly not scared of dying. I am 62 years old and a buddhist...what will be will be. However, I do have adult children who would be very upset if I didn't try something. I know its my own body, etc etc, but I do believe that when you have children they (and any happiness in their lives to which I can contribute) are a responsibility to some extent, even when they are adults. Hence the idea of a double mastectomy. The'relatively' short recuperation time is, to me, far better that spending the next couple of years juggling my work sick leave to have at least two operations which are not really what I want.  Anyway, I would like to say again, please please continue to tell your story on this thread...it has been an enormous help to me in my own (very recent) journey. And its also inspiring to hear the stories of all the other women who have shared. I am not looking for affirmation of my views as stated above, you are all such lovely women and we are all struggling with this \"nasty little critter\" but I needed to present another perspective which I personally need to take into account to fit my own persona and values...to ensure we are not all stereotyped together as women.....I know that everyone else on this and other threads are doing much the same thing. I hope no-one is offended, even if you disagree.  Hope things go well for everyone either on this thread or on the other threads, which I have also read with interest. Virtual hugs to you all Lulu",

      "Content": "Hi Annie Thanks for your thoughtful reply detailing your experiences. It was really good to hear how a reconstruction was once once you came out at the other side. It has really helped me weigh up the options. I'm still keen to go for the double mx anyway.  What a brave woman you are to tell it in such detail. I am blown away by your candour, and hope it was not too difficult for you to write it. So, my plan is to speak to the surgeon and tell him my wishes. If he says no, then I will ask for another opinion and move things forward hopefully in that direction. And, as I said, I will ask for time to think and absorb. It's amazing that they rush women through to make a quick decision at this traumatic time, but, ironically, take more than two weeks to even get the letter out for a CT scan....as you might guess I am still waiting for that letter. thanks again to all who have responded.  Lulu x",

      "Content": "Hi Chloecat I meant to reply sooner re your kind post to me. You mentioned that, having checked out salvestrols, you thought they were the same as resveretrol, which you take. It's my understanding that resveretrols are immune system boosters. That's not what salvestrols are. Whilst they are both to do with fruit and veg consumption, salvestrols are said to activate the cyp1b1 which is present in all cancer cells and, once activated, is said to destroy cancer cells. Or at least I understand it to be something like that. Apologies if I haven't been very exact in my description, or am wrong in my interpretation of what resveretrols actually are. Please note I'm not making any claims for salvestrols as a cancer cure for anyone or everyone. I just feel I have little to lose and possibly something to gain if I take them. Most likely there are many holistic and healthy eating pathways which make a difference to some extent. I hope you are still fighting those little critters. Hugs Lulu x",
