      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed and had my chemo last year, it was tough but looking back I would say be prepared with ready meals, I found the tastier and spicier the better, I was ill for about a week once the chemo took effect ( after 3 days ). I bought cuppa soups, I found that I couldn't drink coffee though enjoyed flavoured teas.  My Breast clinic nurse told me to forget about low calorie diet foods and eat foods for energy, full fat yogurts, avocado, in fact anything you fancy. Throughout the whole ordeal I never once Googled my condition, thought I was in good hands with Doctors and I just didn't want to know, everybody is different.  At the very beginning I was told it would be a year of treatments, and it was, I had chemo, surgery and Radiotherapy ( worried for nothing about having this, it was a doddle ), I was discharged from hospital last month and am cancer free so it has all been worth it.  Tell your mum to listen to what her body tells her and don't try to do too much, she will be fine, especially with a caring daughter at the side of her.  Tettie ",

      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose, Chin up, I learned to go with the flow, I had 17 Herceptin injections, 8 were administered with the Chemo and 9 at home, I finished my last one two weeks ago, peripheral neuropathy in my toes, hopefully this will gradually go, the nurse said side effects should subside in around eight weeks, fingers crossed. At the time, going through Chemo you think you will never get back to 'normal' again, I now am 99% back, so keep up the fight Ruby. Yes you do lose a year, but when I look back now it was worth all the dibiltating side effects, now cancer free, no more appointments, sat in Tenerife writing this, there is light at the end of that long tunnel, keep fighting Ruby Rose and get a holiday booked in preparation. They also took all of my lymph nodes, did a lumpectomy on my left breast and made the right one match, now have lovely small breasts, they used to be F cup now C, so breast reduction on the NHS, excellent! By the way, I was stage 3, thought my life was over but determined to fight, you sound to be at a low Ebb Ruby, keep fighting you will get there,  Tettie x",
