    "Content": "My mom died of breast cancer in 1976. After my younger sister was diagnosed with breast cancer, she got tested and found she had the BRCA1 gene. I got tested and was positive. I had prophylatic removal of ovaries in Nov. 06 and they found cancer - Stage 1A aggressive. I was so lucky to find it so early. It recurred and I had surgery Dec 08 but again it was found early. Early detection is the key. I am currently undergoing chemo AGAIN. Had she not gotten tested I wouldn't have really thought about it. So really my sister saved my life! I believe Knowledge is power, ignorance is not BLISS!",
