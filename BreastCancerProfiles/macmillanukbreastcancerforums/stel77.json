He then started to to tell me about an article he had read in the paper about a young woman of 23 that has breast cancer and also a had a double mx due to her carrying the bcra1 gene, obviously you instantly feel for her, he then went on to say, its a real shame because she was like a page 3 model. pretty with big boobs. i said to him is it not a real shame for Jane smith from accounts with her normal looks and 36B boobs ? he sais it would of been different if she was 60. my hackles started to come up then and i couldn't hold my tongue , would he have said it wouldn't have been so bad if she was 60 if it had been his mother ? No i don't think so,     I don't understand how someone that has been through this shit with me can say stuff like that. Please am i being over sensitive  or is he an arse ?    ",
