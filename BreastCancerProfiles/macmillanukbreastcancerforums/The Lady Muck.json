Lymph biopsy results and mamogram guided biopsy results back tomorrow. I guess that if the lymph results come back positive then it'll be a CT or similar scan to see where it might have spread too. My son is still breastfed, and I know I will need to wean him before the surgery but that aspect almost above all others has upset me. I know it's a little thing in the grand scheme of things, but the heart feels what it feels. I have told my parents and sister. They are hugely in shock and I'm not sure how well they are coping - they are torn between calling all the time and not calling so as to not bother me. I've not told many people in real life - figured there's not much point until after tomorrow.   Thanks for the support so far. Will update with more results in due course.   LM",

I have one cancerous growth of 4mm which is stage 2 cancer, and another which is 2mm and stage 3. 2 out of 3 nodes also came back as positive for cancer as well. In short, BOLLOCKS. Big fat hairy ones. Next stage, a further operation, in the next 2 weeks (they are basically creating a space for me in the already very full surgical list) to remove all the nodes and glands from under my right arm. 10days - 2 weeks after that, I'll see an Oncologist and they will decide the next course of treatment. Definitely Tamoxifen for the next 5 yrs, and probably Chemo or Herceptin if applicable. If anyone feels like sharing their knowlegde of the above, please shout. I felt great after the mx and fully expect to feel worse after the node clearance. Will have to put some more childcare etc in place and it looks like my cleaners will become more \"permanent\" over the next few months. Thanks in advance   LM x",

I don't mean to scare you, but it could be worse.   My initial diagnosis was DCIS and  despite being enlarged my lymph nodes tested negative. I opted for a mastectomy and when everything was tested in full, it was found that I had 2 invasive carcinomas, stage 2 and 3, and in fact, 3 of 16 lymph nodes were found to be positive for tumour cells.   They cannot tell everything from a biopsy because they are looking for such tiny cells and it is impossible to tell without disecting the whole thing.   However, I do appreciate that it is bloody scary and a horrid idea - having part of your breast cut away, but the surgeons and whole Multi Disciplinary Team do know what they are doing. It won't just be one person assessing you, it will be the whole team.   If you aren't sure then a 2nd opinion might be a good idea.   To be honest, I don't fancy the side effects that will come with the chemo, RT, tamoxifen, and Herceptin that I am about to have, but I prefer the CHANCE of having the side effects, or not, as the case may be, to the other option, which is death.   I know what I have said is harsh, but in some ways it is pretty cut and dried.   Best of luck making your decision.   LM x",

When is your appointment? I'd be asking (if it were me) what the next stage is, and probably, whether they'd recommend a lumpectomy or mastectomy.   I'm sure that they have a plan in place though, to make sure they kick the cancer's arse so you can get your life back.   Don't forget, that it is your body though, and if you have a preference, they have to take it into account.   Take care   LM x   PS - if you want an appointment sooner, never be afraid to ask for one/keep chasing up.",

Just because I eat  meat doesn't mean that my body is going to absorb all of that animals hormones which will then have a domino effect on my own. It just isn't that simple. Do you have a scientific background? We use a huge range of ingredients, and there is nothing in terms of ingredients that specifically targets the reproductive potential of the animals, and it is the same whichever animal you look at. All we do is (and we do make our own feed) make feed that promotes general growth, i.e. has the correct levels of protein, carbs etc in. Nothing is targeted at increasing the reproductive capacity of an animal. My cancer is also E+, and I have no intention of becoming vegetarian. Meat is perfectly safe to eat, in MODERATION, like everything else. We are omnivores, and designed to eat meat. It is not natural for us to exlude a particular food source from our diets. How do you monitor your hormone levels by the way? Do you have regular testing to ascertain what they are and adjust your food intake accordingly? Do you just drink bottled water? There is no evidence that avoiding dairy products will lessen chances of getting cancer/cancer recurring. Do you only eat fish that is fished from the wild rather than farmed?

They were flexible though - if I had wanted to stay in I could have done. They won't leave a drain in (well, it is unusual to these days). Mx bra - no need. I bought some cheap crop tops from Sainsburys which have been fabulous. I've also found that nursing bras are great at holding the soft prosthesis in, so I haven't bought any yet. I had some lymph nodes removed at the same time and am waiting to hear if I need any more out - had the Sentinel node test during op. Looking at the gap is fine for the first week or so - there is a full dressing on (waterproof, so you can shower) so there is nothing to see. I am also squeemish and not looking forward to having the whole lot off on Tuesday. To be honest, I think my motto is going to be \"don't look down\". I had wondered whether I could live without a breast on one side, but there's no way I can, so I also keep telling myself that it is only temporary. If it helps at all, I have had no pain with it at all. I had cording before the op due to lymph node biopsies that that gives more pain when I reach for things. The exercises do help though. I took paracetamol and ibuprofen as recommended on Saturday and Sunday last week, then eased off the paracetamol on Monday - didn't notice any different and have only been taking the ibuprofen since - due to it's anti inflammatory skills rather than pain relief. I've also had no swelling. Hope that helps a bit. I have taken some photos to try and make me get to grips with it all. It's scary as hell, but I keep telling myself that cancer is scarier.   Take care and good luck with the op   LM x",
