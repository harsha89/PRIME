      "Content": "Hi Mary-Ann I finished my chemo last May prior to having WLE and rads.  I started chemo 6 days after diagnosis so didn't have much too much time to get too worked up as I was just in shock (having had a clear routine mammogram a few months earlier).   But do try not to get too worked up......  I can say hand on heart that (for me and many others) it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Of course it is not nice but like many on here have said before me \"it is doable\".  You will probably feel a bit better about it once you get the first one out of the way.  I found the second T part more manageable than the FEC - which shows that it affects everyone differently.  You can always find support on this site.  Take care ,M",
