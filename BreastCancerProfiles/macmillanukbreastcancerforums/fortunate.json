    "Content": "sorry to hear about this, my treated breast became swollen after 10 weeks of having radiotheraphy and very painfull and tender, i went back to the oncologist who sent me for another biopsy just to be sure of what is happening the result was clear except that there is fluid in the breast and the oncologist said that it is the effect of radiotheraphy.no medication recomended except pain killer to ease away the pain i must tell you, this is three months plus after i finished my radiotheraphy, am still having all sorts of pain, shooking, biting, needling etc. the only thing i do now is to wear bra there and then so that i will not feel the pain much when i move or turn. Anybody with similar experience should share with us",
