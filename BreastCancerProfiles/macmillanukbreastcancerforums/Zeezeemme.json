      "Content": "Hi everyone, I hope all of you are staying strong and fighting hard. I am a little bit discouraged and need some good advice. Ive been diagnosed with breast cancer on my right breast 2 weeks ago. Ive got a 6cm IDC and a 3cm DCIS. On the left the lump seems benogn but they will proceed with a vacuum biopsy and they will put a coil in my righr breast to mark the right place. Diring my ct scan they also found a 7mm nodule on my left lung they cannot say what it is. The plan is to start with chemo and after 3 cycles have a ct scan to re evaluate my situation. I still am reqired to do a mri before. My point is...i have waited a week to be told nothing concrete. No date for mri, or vacuum biopsy or coil.. no starting date for chemo but an appoint ment at the 26th of March to meet the oncologists and then between 1-2 weeks to start treatments. My cancer is very aggressive and spread fast. Lympho nodes on my right side are already infected.. I feel like Im waisting time. How long did you wait? Is it me or the time between actions is a huge waist of precious time where my cancer is going to spread more and more???? Tia for all your wise pieces of advice. Xx",
