Friend then said 'Don't you think you are milking it just because you have had cancer' I had to walk away so she did not notice that my eyes filled up. Maybe I am over reacting to any aches and pains, as now I am starting to question myself. I just feel so upset that anyone could think like that. I have always been a strong and independent woman and not shy about giving out my opinion  (even though I am only 5 foot tall and only weight seven and a half stone)and she reduced me to tears. Is this what this bloody cancer has done to me. xx",

The lumpectomy left me with a large dent due to the amount of tissue they removed but as I was small anyway I wasn't too fussed. But I didn't opt for reconstruction even after mastectomy as I wanted the least amount of recovery time, but everyone is different . Take your time making your decision as you will find at first you will keep changing your mind. Lots of hugs. xx",

I am waiting on a letter explaining everything and hopefully that will tell me. But has anyone else had this, not a normal type? I wish I could have listened more intently instead of my brain going with the fairies. Now I have remembered this I starting to stress again and looking up types of cancer, not a sensible thing to do. All this stressing though is not doing me any good, I am 5ft and seven an half stone and lose weight so quickly, I have always been skinny but worried I might slip down a drain or plughole if I don't stop worrying. Any cake donations appreciated, I cant cook    :)",
