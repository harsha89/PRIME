    "Content": "I was diagnosed in December and after all the chats with the doctor and nurses i went for the cold cap on my first chemo session on the 24th January and it was horrific and unfortunately my hair started falling out on Monday so i decided that its not worth the torture.....try it for yourself as you can always opt out as i understand it its all individual when it comes to chemo what works for one doesn't work for others. Good luck with whatever you decide x",
