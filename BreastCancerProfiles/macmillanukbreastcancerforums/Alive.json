It is designed for hormone induced hair loss. ( decreasing levels of estrogen). It does seem to work. I buy mine from Boots. It costs about £10 a bottle, but could be worth giving a try. Maggie x",

Can't help at all with advice I am afraid, but just wanted to let you know I'm here.  Stick with it I am sure that in time you will recover. and begin to feel better. I am not surprised that you are peeed off with it all. Try to do what you really feel like doing over Christmas whatever it is you feel like. Roast dinner in the freezer for anyone who disagrees. THEY can heat it up in the microwave!!!! You just have what you fancy, Chocolate and wine comes to mind. I am sure you wont need to worry about the delay before Radiotherapy. it is designed to zap any cancer cells that may have been left behind. So if they are there they wont stand a chance. Take care and be kind to yourself. Maggie x",

Pretty underwear is for all of us!! I think I heard that M&S do a range of mastectomy bras have you looked at them? It is harder sometimes if you live alone, there isn't anyone next to you for when you need a cuddle, a shoulder to cry on or someone to let off steam to. At least on this site you get as much support as you need from people who are going through the same as you. I have found close friends invaluable. Family can be very good but you often hide how you are really feeling because you don't want to upset them so its difficult sometimes. Keep your chin up, you are doing really well and will eventually get used to the 'new' you. Maggie x",

It's no joke when these appointments come round and that too I understand. Try to be as relaxed as you can I know that's easier said than done. Comfort yourself a little with the knowledge that if anything does go wrong in the early days you are being 'checked' up on regularly so anything odd will be caught very early on. Can you give yourself a little treat while you are getting close to appointments, something nice to help you feel a little pampered maybe?  You are being really positive and that is good but we all feel low and worried and have a little wobble sometimes. Thinking off you and sending you love and a (much needed?) hug. Maggie x",

I have been using No 7 Ridge filling base and then applying nail varnish over the top. It doesn't heal it, but does protect and hide the problem. Take care of yourself, remember to be kind to yourself as you go through your Radiotherapy and please don't push yourself to hard. If you feel tired, then rest. I found it helpful to have easy meals in the freezer which only needed zapping in the microwave when I was having mine. It was so easy when I felt washed out.  Wishing you all the best. Maggie x",

We all need support to keep us going and hugs even virtual and animal ones are vital and give us a lift. Don't worry about the awake thread even if it's permanently closed, we have another one here! I have seen somethings similar to this happen on other sites. It just seems to be the way it goes sometimes, everyone is different and some people just seem to react with anger. Instead cast your mind back to Saturday. We all had a lovely time. That's what it's all about support, laughter and happy times to counteract the times when we feel low  and overwhelmed by the whole thing. Onwards and upwards everyone. Let's put it all behind us and start again. Love and hugs to you all Maggie xx  ",

I felt a total idiot because I had been doing fine up until then. I think that a year on you are probably still feeling fragile inside even though most of the time you are ok. Don't worry. It does get easier as time goes by. Be kind to yourself while you await your results and try to enjoy yourself. Then, when you have a positive outcome to the mammogram, celebrate and have fun.  Maggie x",
