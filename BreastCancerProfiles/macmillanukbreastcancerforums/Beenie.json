      "Content": "Hello, First off, sending lots of positive vibes to everyone other there with cancer or recovering from it - remember we have to kind to ourselves!   I am three weeks post mastectomy and tram flap reconstruction of my left breast, along with sentinel node biopsy.  I was diagnosed with grade 2 invasive lobular cancer- 60mm ER positive 8/8, PR positive 8/8 but HER-2 negative. Consultant said it was very early stages (find that hard to believe given the size of the lump...) Luckily my nodes were clear (so I guess I am stage 2), and I am cancer free (very weird to realise this) so have been referred to an Oncologist for Oncotype (??) testing to see if radiotherapy or Chemo will be of benefit to me. I'm hoping they give me the all clear. Has anyone had the Oncotype test and been told they don't need any further treatment?  I am just starting to get a good nights sleep ( 4 straight hours; have only recently managed to sleep on my side for 1hr - who knew that would be something to miss!), for the last three weeks, sleep has been a rare gift so much so that I'm using Nytol for the next few days to help me stay asleep for a decent amount of time. My bed currently resembles a pillow fort, it's a miracle my husband can fit on the bed  but the constant sleeping on my back is taking it's toil. I can't wait till I'm fully back to sleeping on my side or belly - how long did it take you guys? My wounds appear to be healing ok, apart from one spot under my new boob and along my bikini line.  They still seem quite weepy (get my dressings changed every 2/3 days at hospital), does anyone have experience of slower healing wounds - how long it took for them to catch up to the rest?  I am planning a reduction of the right breast next year, consultant suggested waiting to see the actual size and shape of the reconstructed breast. Makes sense, tho I am now wondering how I am going to manage two very different sized boobs (am h/J cup in the right,and the new breast is expected to be a C/D cup once all the swelling goes down). What are people's experiences going for bra fittings?  The thought of it fills me with dread... I'm also freaking out about a cervical smear test I have soon, keep thinking if i had breast cancer, what's to stop me having cervical cancer too.  Rationally I know the odds are extremely low, but still feel like I have a target on my back.   Sorry for the monster brain dump/rant, my brain has and always be way faster than my body and the whole being patient thing is quite difficult at the moment! Ta all, B xx",

      "Content": "Also will check out M&S, Debenhams and Bravissimo - to be fair Bravissimo is where I usually get my bras and I never considered they might support odd shape boobies.  Going to drop them an email and hope for the best. Yes, I too have a v-shape pillow - most nights it does the trick. Still not able to sleep fully on my back, guess I'll be propped upright for a few more weeks yet.  ",
