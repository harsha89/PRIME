We are in good hands, I think.  A friend likens our three week cycle to this week 1 is like feeling like a limp lettuce, week 2 - we are in spring onion phase and week 3-broccoli week getting up strength for next chemo treatment.  So I am back in the limp lettuce week -cheering all fellow limp lettuces on from my sofa!   ",
