      "Content": "Thank you Carolyn that was incredibly helpful especially as you are multi tasking! :-) Charing Cross has been recommended by the breast consultant who diagnosed me but only because it was closest not based on reputation... After research Royal Marsden is Top of my list but also considering Charing Cross and Guys and John Radcliffe Oxford (I live near Reading). I am now going to research UCL as that was not on my radar :-)  A few of the surgeons you mention are on my list so appreciate your comments and I also now understand that I can not choose anyway.  I have a Grade 2 IDC in left and DCIS in right. No pre Rads or Chemo My understanding from  your comments is I should expect to be prioritised based on that. My Breast Consultant said I should get surgery within 6-8 weeks but was not sure that was realistic. Out of interest did Marsden have a BMI limit? I am a size 14 but v short so BMI is 32 ... I heard some insist on below 30! Also, did you get to find out the wait list times at each hospital before you chose as this would impact my decision. Thanks so much kelly x",

      "Content": "Hi There I am looking for advice as I want to have a DMX with immediate DIEP reconstruction but my local hospital can not do it. My consultant has referred me back to my GP and I now need to start the referral process and find somewhere to do it! Has anyone gone through this process ? Very worried about how long it might take!  Can anyone recommend a hospital/surgeon in the London/south west or south east area that does this?  Did anyone go private to get it done quicker? Sorry for all the questions!  Thanks in advance  Kelly ",
