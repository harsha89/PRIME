    "Content": "Hi All I work as a cancer advocate in the staffordshire and Wolverhampton area. I currently have a client who has been taking Anastrozol after a diagnosis of breast cancer and since had a double mastectomy. Â She has since stopped taking this as she feels she couldn't cope with the side effects, especially as it resulted in have problems at work due to her mood and anxiety. I am currently providing information for her employer and highlighting the effects of this drug. While I am able to get lots of information from medical sites, I wondered if anyone had any thoughts on how it may have effected them? Thanks in advance Caroline",
