      "Content": "Hello to December's crew! Midway between cycles 3 and 4 and I am beginning to notice the build up if side effects. Nothing major - a niggly sore throat, a bit of nausea here and there, but this month I have noticed that my hands are shaking more frequently. Not major like if I had Parkinsons, but enough that my shopping list looks like a doctor's prescription! Also means that I can't occupy myself with my major hobbies of sewing or cross stitch! So I'm getting antsy about it all now!  As both times i have been to see the oncologist, he has said that my WBC count has been low I went out and bought a marrow bone to make some beef broth this week! We'll see if that makes any difference! Good luck to anyone on chemo this week",

      "Content": "Went to hospital yesterday for my oncologist clinic - appt at 9.40. At 10.30 a nurse comes out to say that he had been delayed - she wasn't sure why, but advised everyone to stay put. Finally the unit manager informed us 10 minutes later that he would not be coming, but they would get one of the other oncologists to cover his clinic, so please be patient! Got seen FINALLY about 11.20 by a doctor who looked about 12! Surprise, surprise that my WBC is low AGAIN! (Has been on every session! She agreed that I should have a reduced dose on my first Docetaxel, but I have to have the injections! However she wanted me to have more blood tests! So I wandered over to that department and sat there until nearly half past 12! And then they had trouble getting blood, so she passed me over to another \"vampire\" who finally managed to get enough blood out! So a quick clinic trip turned into a whole morning's \"adventure\"! And I still have to turn up tomorrow not knowing if I'll get my first Docetaxel treatment or not! Hope everyone else's week turns out better than mine! X",

Last night I gave myself the first injection - something I was dreading! The injection wasn't too bad though as I did it just before bed and dropped off to sleep quite quickly. However I woke about 4 times overnight - couple of loo trips, but general aches and pains and also pain just over my breast bone. Incidentally my nurse told me not to clean the clean with an antiseptic wipe but to use clean water to clean the skin and dry before injecting.  However today when I got up, I felt really dizzy! Lasted about an hour. Still feel weak, but temperature not raised, so just going to take some paracetamol to see if that can help. Doesn't help either that we suddenly have no hot water this afternoon, so got to sit and wait for an engineer to call as an emergency appointment! I was lucky with my FEC cycles. Although I had a bit of nausea and headaches (and night sweats with the steroids) on the whole I didn't suffer too much. I had a runny nose and bit of a sore throat too, but they seemed to be more a symptom of my neutropenia rather than the FEC! ",

      "Content": "Semh thanks for listing what you went through! Most of what you describe, I had already had with my FEC cycles! My nose has run virtually constantly since day 1! I had a few days where I had a nose bleed too, but my nurses weren't worried! I am so tired after just 4 of those injections! But when I get to bed I wake up about 2am and then can't get back to sleep! Today I dozed off again at some point, waking at 9.30! Then I dozed again! And bedtime has slowly crept forward to about 9pm too! My metallic taste has reappeared, and my appetite has disappeared completely! I'm trying to eat little and often, but some days I just don't want to eat anything. I have to remind myself to keep drinking as I know I don't drink enough on a normal basis. I seem to have developed a taste for orange juice mixed with lemonade, so I'm going with that.  My left hand in particular seems sore - chemo nurse seemed to think it was because I'm not drinking enough - she described it as similar to gout! Since starting the injections, I have had pains in my right armpit (where my lymph nodes were removed), a pain across the top of my chest and pains in my left thigh - but I'm told they are just the filgrastim doing it's job! And to add insult to injury today I woke up with terrific stomach cramp - eventually alleviated by sitting on the toilet for half an hour! My WBC has been low throughout all my chemo (I spent 6 nights in Hotel NHS on cycle one), so I am trying to do everything by the book now as I really don't want to end up there over Christmas/New Year!  Hope you tolerate the EC treatment okay. ",

      "Content": "This afternoon, I have to go to the breast clinic to discuss the results of my latest MRI. I was due to have surgery in Feb - mastectomy with immediate reconstruction via DIEP - but because of an \"anomaly\" on my spine it was postponed. (Subsequent tests showed it was merely degeneration, so the op could have gone ahead. Since then my husband has started chemo for his liver/stomach cancer having just had session 4 out of 12.  I really would like to go ahead with the immediate reconstruction (if still offered), but not sure how we will cope if I'm out of action for such a long recovery period? I do the driving as he's not strong enough, and although he hasn't had side effects from his chemo, some days he is very weak. If I had the mastectomy and delayed the rest - what's the usual time between ops? How long does it take to recover from the mastectomy itself?  I'd be VERY grateful for any insights others could give me. I know it's almost like \"how long is a piece of string\" questions, but any help might get rid of my butterflies for today! Sandie",

      "Content": "I am home from a very long afternoon sat in our local hospital! DH had an appointment for removal of hid chemo bottle which was almost an hour late, so I left him and ran to my appt in another part of the hospital. To be told that BC appts were running an hour late, so I ran back to find DH and then walking back to my BC appt!  Doctor told me that the MRI results I had done last Thursday weren't back yet ! (Why didn't they make the appointment for a week earlier?) Anyway after a physical exam of the affected breast, he seemed to think that the Letrozole was doing it's job as the breast seemed to be softer - so obviously doing it's job. Once he sees the MRI results next Tuesday, he will get the BC nurse to ring me and discuss how I want to proceed. As DH has just finished chemo 4 out of 12, he offered to extend the medication route for perhaps 3 months, which would allow his treatment to finish before I had any surgery. So now we have several days when we can discuss what might be best in our situation. After wanting the mastectomy and recon done in one go, I'm now leaning towards 2 separate ops. He did say there was probably going to be radiotherapy after mastectomy, so it would be better I suppose if DH had finished his treatment, otherwise we'll be spending days up there at a time!  Thanks for the advice/comments earlier. Hope your conversation is positive next week Sandie x",

      "Content": "Good Morning everyone! As there  have been no recent posts, I'm assuming everyone is doing ok with their rads? Or have we just given up??  I finished mine last month, but since then have developed the dreaded rash and itchyness. Remembering what I was told on my last session, I bought some hydrocortisone cream and have been applying it regularly, but now - 3 weeks later - it's still there! It's right at the top of the area they radiated in the centre of my chest and just a bit under my collar bone so it's visible when I wear an open necked shirt or lower t-shirt. I've been covering it in aloe vera gel and moisturiser every time I think about it. What I really want to know I suppose is - is this normal? How long does it carry on for? I don't want to bother the nurses if all they say is keep creaming it!  On another side note, I have my second session with my Macmillan counsellor today - I felt sorry for the poor guy at our first session as I spent 50 minutes pouring out the story of the last two and a half years! But it felt so good to be able to open up to someone who would not judge how I was dealing with it all. And yesterday someone from the Hospice bereavement service rang me. Although Mike never made it to the hospice, the nurse at the hospital had referred me to them. She offered me some group sessions once I finish my one to one sessions, and sounded really positive that I would find it beneficial. So I'll investigate that later too. Anyway, I hope everyone is doing ok. There is a light at the end of the gloomy tunnel. And I hope that you all have a happy Easter.",

The seroma is building again, so I need to get that drained, but is this kind of lump normal?

One note of caution though Pinterest is well-known for not policing copyright! Too many people post patterns (even full cross stitch patterns) there, and of course that then deprives the original designer of the purchase price. So just be careful out there! I have a board for cross stitch, but I am careful to post only the finished article, never a full pattern UNLESS I can confirm myself that it is a genuine freebie. Meanwhile everyone keep crafting!

      "Content": "Thanks for the link and info on the knocker pattern Kacang. I've been a lifelong crafter and these last few years it has been my salvation. When husband was diagnosed with bowel cancer in Dec 2016, I had just started a large cross stitch (well just over A4 sized), but working on that and a knitted mermaid tail for my granddaughter's Christmas present kept me sane! I was diagnosed with lymph node grade 2 BC just after Christmas this year and again, cross stitch has saved my sanity. It's wonderful how many times you can stab something in the name of embroidery and get away with it!  Ha Ha!  I've also joined a group on Facebook that paints pictures on rocks and pebbles, then leaves them in places for others to find - Love on the rocks it's called. It's amazing how much joy can be given to someone by a simple piece of art on a pebble. Check it out!",

As I'm not sure if the board allows us to post links to blogs, I'll send it to you privately somehow? Not quite sure yet what I can and can't do on here!! Meanwhile if you check online for \"Tigermum's creative corner\" you might find it!  I generally use 18ct Aida, but have been venturing into some hand-dyed fabrics lately. Like you I have boxes of kits I bought many years ago, some have been in boxes in our shed for about 5 years! But I also tend to buy the pattern and use my own collection of threads. ",

      "Content": "@kumihimo That's  a fab idea. I had my SN removal at the end of Jan, with a view to mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction mid Feb. But the SN revealed cancer cells, so the day before my op, it was cancelled to do more tests. However 2 months down the line I have been getting pain at the lower end of my underarm scar over the last few days. Not sure of it's just because of the cold, damp weather or something else. As I can't speak to a BCN over the Easter weekend, I might try something like this to see if it will help. Care to share what you used? What did you fill it with? How long do you heat it for?

I needed to delay my surgery to allow for my husband's chemo - the surgeon allowed me to start on hormone therapy and then when DH finished his cycles, I asked for an appointment and told them \"surgery ASAP please\". Within 2 weeks I had my mastectomy, and surgeon was able to tell me that although there were 7 tumours, he had got it all. Now I wait to see oncologist tomorrow and see what my next steps are! So be confident, they know what they are doing, they will talk you through step by step, and of your BC nurse is as good as mine, she will sit and hold your hand as long as you need. Good luck!",
