I have entered Race For Life in June with my two daughters in support as I feel I want to give something back.  Love and hugs to all xxx    ",

      "Content": "Hi all after my emotional meltdown and rambling post last on Saturday evening, after a long dog walk yesterday morning, albeit still crying, I felt much better. I cleared out the loft and spare bedroom in the afternoon which took hours but I felt good girl doing.  Thanks for all your posts of support. We have a huge amount of emotional and psychological fallout to deal with after cancer treatment. When moaning to my daughter about my husband's insensitivity, she reminded me that he has been by my side throughout and has had heart problems to deal with himself which made me feel selfish. On a lighter note we kept the little dog. My husband finally recognised my fragile emotional state and didn't think I would cope well with parting with her as I've become very attached to her.  He phoned the lady who was coming to see her and she was very understanding. In conversation it turned out she had treatment for breast cancer herself 20 years ago.  I feel happy we have kept her as she has settled so well and both fogs slept all night yay!  Denise xx.   ",

I was fairly fortunate with my appointments being sent through but I did have to chase a couple.  One was for an ultrasound scan which without the results of would have made my next meeting with the oncologist pointless.  It was when my appointments didn't ycome through on time that I became anxious - almost like I felt I had been forgotten!  I mentioned it to the oncologist at my next appointment and it didn't happen again.  I know it's just a slip up on the Admin side but when you are going through what we are its hugely important. Having them in place gave me a sense of reassurance.  Like Ani I did at one point feel I needed to keep a check on them and even created a spreadsheet to log and keep a record of my appointments - 53 to date!  It might seem a bit over the top for some but made me feel more in control - I needed to doit for my employer anyway.  Appointments come through like clockwork now - I even got the same one twice for my next heart scan but better that way! Hope all starts going to plan for Julie - make sure you speak up! Sending hugs. Denise xx",

By the time I saw him the node had disappeared and was put down to the fact I had a cold prior to it appearing so it was just a normal reaction to a virus.

The other day I actually felt sorry for the soft monkey toy that was strapped to the rear bumper of a truck!! Then my husband and I went to a 60s New Amen Corner event which was great with all the songs off yesteryear but I found myself welling up!  I get tearful when I'm happy or sad.

When I saw another GP last Friday for another issue, I mentioned it to her. She could see I was anxious and ordered a full blood test which I had yesterday and an ultrasound which I had today.  The Consultant said there were a couple of nodes behind my ear which were slightly enlarged.  In fairness he did say if it wasn't for my breast cancer history he would not have referred me further as they could be \"reactive nodes\" which have come up in defence of infection such as the cold.  However, you can imagine how anxious I am at being referred back to the hospital to check all is well.  He did say they may have gone down by the time I have my hospital appointment in which case they will take no further action ... if not it will be a needle aspiration.  Anybody else had any similar experiences?  Positive vibes needed please ladies.  Living with constant anxiety is so difficult.  Denise xx",

I actually saw a young Registrar at my appointment as I refuse to see my own GP who I feel seriously failed me - but that's another story. He listened and suggested Mindfullness sessions which I have booked on to, ensuring I get \"healthy sleep\" and setting myself goals with things I enjoy such as my craft hobbies.  I did buy apiano when I was first diagnosed - a knee jerk reaction as I have always wanted to play.  I have self taught myself so far but do intend having lessons.  I am also having acupuncture through the local cancer support unit to help with joint ache from Letrazole.  As I said to Susie I think it's a case of adjusting to the new normal both physically band mentally.  The bottom line for me is that Iam still here!  Keep on keeping on and keep posting - would be interested to compare notes.  Denise xx    ",

Good luck with getting a dog Judith - my little Westie has become so close to me since diagnosis. If I have a nap in the afternoon she is always there with me and, of course, encourages me to get out for walks.  We also had an older Westie but sadly had to say goodbye to him last year just after my diagnosis!  I have almost persuaded my husband to get a rescue dog when we return from holiday in July.  I think it's good to have things to focus on.  We have just had half of our lawn (which was in poor condition) dug up and my husband has made a vegetable plot - mind you the amount we have paid out so far on this project, these cauliflowers will be costing me £30 ha ha! It was very sad to hear about Rio Ferdinand's wife yesterday - just what I didn't need to hear at the moment but makes me realise I am fortunate to have been given a chance however tough it can be! Love chatting to you lovely ladies - sending good wishes to you all.  Denise xxx",

      "Content": "Hi susieq123 I was going through exactly what you are and still do.  Some days I feel relatively normal then suddenly I am sideswiped by a down mood and anxiety sets it.  This hit me worst when I had completed my treatment but after researching it now know this is completely normal.  I had an emotional meltdown a couple of weekends ago and was even going to pay privately for a scan.  However, as my husband said how long would it be before the reassurance from this wore off and the anxiety would kick in again?  I did attend an 8 week Cancer Survivorship Programme through my local cancer support unit.  This taught strategies and techniques for coping post cancer as well as nutritional advice.  I have also had some complementary therapies including massage and acupuncture and have booked onto a Mindfullness course.   Although the treatment we receive in the UK is excellent, I think we lag behind in addressing the emotional and mental impact of cancer. I bought a couple of books off Amazon relating survivorship stories as I gain strength and inspiration from these.  They were both published in USA - both USA and Canada appear to be way ahead in supporting cancer survivors.  I do think we will reach a point in our recovery where we wake up and cancer is not the first thing on our mind ... it just takes time to adjust mentally. I have my six month post surgery appointment with my Breast Consultant on Monday and plan to ask lots of questions.   Keep going ... you will get a bit stronger every day and always know there are others who know how you feel.  Denise xx  ",

She is getting married in March so has been on an emotional roller coaster.  She was glad she managed to put her wedding dress on so her dad could see her in it which brought tears to my eyes.  Anyway her news and the sadness in her face when she told me came back to me later that evening and I just couldn't stop crying.  My usually supportive husband told me to \"stop wallowing\" as \"you don't have cancer any more\".  He also implied the family were tired of me wanting to talk about cancer although my daughters have since reassured me this isn't the case.  I know the whole experience puts relationships under great strain particularly after the shock of the original diagnosis and before you know your treatment plan/prognosis.  Having said that I don't think there is enough consideration given to the massive emotional/physical impact that hits like a train once treatment ends.  People expect you to just pick up where you left off but it's not that easy. I've been referred for counselling through our local cancer support unit which I am looking forward to having.  Most of the time I cope but the anxiety/depression creeps in without warning and can be tough. Take care. Denise x",

The feelings of devastation following the initial diagnosis and anxiety waiting for a biopsy and the result were extremely hard to deal with. Your mind takes you to all weird and wonderful places! Once my treatment plan was in place I felt more in control. I am having neo adjuvant chemo prior to a lumpectomy. I have just had my 4th session of EC chemo and will start my first session of Docetaxel followed by my first Herceptin end Sept. Apart from hair loss, nausea and sleep disturbance I have been fairly ok so consider myself fortunate. I am very apprehensive about the side effects of the Docetaxel and any reactions on the first session. I know I will need to just go with it and manage side effects as they present. Surgery will follow and possibly radiotherapy. It's a long journey with good days, bad days emotionally - bit of a roller coaster but overall keeping strong and positive. I would like to hear from anyone who has had the same treatment plan. Sorry about my user name - tried loads more before this but they had been taken so in desperation ha ha. Look forward to chatting later - off to work today. Denise",

It's going to take a while to get used to and the fringe is still far too short but will grow!   It's going to be strange not wearing my wig but it was also quite emotional getting the real me back.  One more thing ticked off.  Denise xx    ",

I was very fortunate as I got it from the Cancer Support Unit who have been fab.  Although I have a couple this one served me well throughout and many people didn't realise it was a wig ... I even fooled the nurses on the chemo ward who thought I had used the cold cap and kept my hair!  I am going to keep it just for back up on days I don't fancy messing with my own hair ha ha!  Denise xx",

I look back and can't believe that after my second chemo in August 2014 I stood in the kitchen and let my husband shave off my hair! I had already chosen a selection of wigs from our local Cancer Support Unit but was in total denial that I would lose my hair.  Somehow I just got on with it and found a wig that suited me and it served me throughout. Looking at the positives I was able to get ready for work much quicker without all that washing, blow drying and straightening! My hair started to grow back at the beginning of last year albeit grey and curly!  In the end I couldn't keep it under my wig so went to see a local hairdresser who has also had chemo. She was shocked when I first removed my wig but was brilliant and guided me re colouring etc. Like you I was desperate for my fringe to grow down as that seemed to take the longest but I have had two hair cuts since.  Hang on in there ... your hair will be back before you know it.  Our hair is part of our identity and it is understandably difficult when we have no control over losing it - I have just read that Victoria Derbyshire, the journalist is finding losing her hair the hardest part of her treatment.  The main thing is you are here and your family and friends will love you with or without hair.  Denise xx",

I have been through the same physically and mentally, the only difference is I was diagnosed at the end of May last year.  If it wasn't for the fatigue, which sometimes feels worse some days than when I was going through treatment plus the joint aches, I could believe it has all been a bad dream! I described to those on a course I attended as having the sensation of stepping outside of myself during chemo, surgery and radiotherapy - like it was happening to someone else.  I think maybe psychologically it's a way of coping.  I expected to feel ecstatic once I was finished treatment but just feel quite numb when I think of all I've been through this past year. Like Maggie I am always on the go and have a full diary plus work in the mornings.  Today has caught up with me and I am very lethargic with no motivation to do anything. My best advice ... take one step at a time and cross bridges as you get to them.  Keep moving forward and be kind to yourself. Denise xx",

I was introduced to the new team  who are very friendly.  My Line Manager  then had a return to work catch up chat during which she told me there are several people in the team with family/friends who are going through cancer treatment with a less positive outlook.  I didn't know how to feel about that - am I not to talk to anyone about my treatment and act like it never happened?  I feel a bit like the \"elephant in the room\" especially as I do not know the individuals involved. Went for my Herceptin injection in the afternoon which was all fine but felt really tired.  In the evening we went to a retirement do for a member of the fire service as my husband was in the service for 31 years. The fireman retiring and his wife are a lovely couple who we have known for many years but have not seen in a long while.  When we arrived she greeted us then with a simpering look on her face said she had only just heard about what I had gone through and was sorry to hear it.  She then went on to tell me that her friend got the all clear then got it in the other breast and got the all clear then got it in her spine and died within three months!  Evening ruined - totally changed my mood.  Fortunately at the end of the evening I was talking to another wife of one ex fireman who went through all treatment and is now five years clear ... helped raise my mood again.  Love to you all going through this - glad we have each other.

      "Content": "Hi Sandy I can certainly identify with how your feeling.  I was diagnosed at the end of May, had 7 sessions of chemo followed by a lumpectomy then axillary node removal.  I go through phases of feeling really well and on top of things and then there are times I'm down and just want to cry and cry.  I think it's good to let it all out and then get yourself back on track. The diagnosis itself is devastating and its hard when everything around you seems to be carrying on as normal but then I feel selfish as there are people going through worse. My husband, family and friends have been amazing in their support and I know not everyone in my situation has this.  I'm just recovering from second surgery which is taking a little longer but I will get there.  It's a long journey with highs and lows along the way but each day us a step nearer in recovery. Keep strong and positive.  Wishing you love and hugs (((xxx))) Denise ",

At times I also get a racing heartbeat even when I'm resting and my blood pressure has sometimes been high when tested.  I think the Letrazole has a lot to do with all this.  I had a blood test recently which showed my iron levels were low and alkaline phosphatase was raised.  GP sent a copy of the results to my oncologist and Breast Cancer Nurse phoned me today to reassure me that oncologist has seen results and is not unduly concerned as these changes in blood are common following chemo. It might be worth you having a blood test though just to check your levels. Denise xx",

We tried some cookies this evening made from anti cancer ingredients - they were a bit like flapjack and were delicious.  Recipes can be found under the Resources tab on the CSP website - see link above.  We also tried a drink made from 1/4 teaspoon of each ginger, turmeric, cinnamon and cloves and half a teaspoon of raw honey.  It was a bit like a chai latte and has huge anti cancer properties.  We were also told to use rapeseed oil to cook rather then olive oil to ensure the Omega 3 good oils are in our diet rather than Omega 6 oils which are bad.  It is all very interesting and I know we need to take all things in moderation but anything that is going to help my body and immune system keep healthy is worth the effort.   Denise xx ",

Firstly, stress reduction is essential to aid recovery and help reduce risk of recurrence.  We have been learning mindfulness, breathing and imaging techniques to help reduce stress at times such as scans / check ups.  Exercise has also been proven without doubt to be beneficial.  This doesn't have to be gym exercise but can be walking for 30 mins 3-4 times a week. We have also been learning about anti cancer foods.  I was already aware of the benefits of wheatgrass and have started taking the powdered form in a drink regularly.  Last week we were told about Matcha which is apparently off the scale in anti cancer properties.  It can be bought from teapigs  http://www.teapigs.co.uk/tea/shop_by_category/matcha_shop#matchatab-intro. I don't know about you but if I think it can help us stay healthy and fight cancer, despite it not tasting that great, I am willing to give it a go!  Garlic is also excellent in preventing cancer cells mutating.  A clove a day is recommended. This week our tutor is bringing some home baked cookies that apparently taste delicious but are full of things that are good for us.  I will feedback later in the week. Love and hugs. Denise xx    ",

I have just started reading \"The Cancer Survivor's Companion\" by Dr Frances Goodhart and Lucy Atkins.  It has really good reviews and received a Book Award in 2012.  Although I have only just started it, I can identify with loads of what I have read so far and realise how \"normal\" what I am experiencing is.  I bought it off EBay and would recommend it.  I am also attending a \"Cancer Survivorship Programme\" at The Olive Tree, the cancer support unit attached to our local hospital.  This teaches strategies and techniques for coping post cancer treatment as well as nutrition advice. I seemed to be fine during the middle part of treatment and didn't expect to feel like this now as I am almost through it!  However, as I said it seems it is normal and many people feel this way.   Sending best wishes and a hug to you all.

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca I was diagnosed at the end of May - the day after my daughter's 21st birthday celebrations.  I was so convinced it would be nothing so was devastated at the cancer diagnosis.  I had 7 sessions of chemo first and had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on 2nd December.  The operation was pretty straightforward and the procedure should be fully explained to you beforehand.  You should also get to speak to the Macmillan nurse who was assigned to you who will be able to answer any questions you may have prior to the op.  Recovery has been fairly swift with minimal pain.  You will be given daily exercises to do to help recovery.  Unfortunately my post op results showed a slither of remaining tissue that needs to be removed plus some further lymph nodes so I am booked in for a second op on Tuesday, the same day as your lumpectomy. It is overwhelming at first when following the shock of diagnosis you are bombarded with literature - there is so much to take in.  As you start to accept the diagnosis, as hard as it is, and have a treatment plan in place, you will feel strong enough to read more and ask for further information if you need it.  There is plenty of support from your Macmillan nurse or on this site where people who have undergone or who are going through similar treatment can share experiences. It is a long journey but take things one step at a time and cross bridges as you get to them.  Stay strong and try to keep positive as there is lots of treatment available.  Hope all goes well with the lumpectomy - I will be thinking of you as I prepare for my second op!

Also once treatment starts you will be surprised how quickly the weeks and months pass until before you know it you are crossing the finishing line.  It can all seem overwhelming but my advice is to take things one step at a time and cross bridges as you get to them. There are lots of possible treatment side effects but we are all different and remember it doesn't mean you will get them.There is always someone to share experiences with on here and to gain support and reassurance including George who oversees the sight and is a font of knowledge when it comes to breast cancer.  Do you know the type or stage of your diagnosis yet?  Sending reassuring hugs (( xx)) - stay strong, you can do this!  Denise xx        ",

If you do get any there are things to help you plus loads of support and advice on this site.  Each day is a day nearer to recovery.  I had 7 sessions of chemo, two surgeries and am now halfway through 15 sessions of radiotherapy. I went to see a friend yesterday who was at the end of her treatment when I started mine and we agreed how quickly the time has gone.  You can do this! Sending hugs ((xx)) Denise      ",

I am currently having counselling through my local Cancer Support Unit which I am finding helpful.  It's good to be able to say exactly what's in your head and working out ways to deal with it.  My husband and family were hugely supportive throughout treatment but you can almost hear them sigh whenever cancer creeps into the conversation now I am through it.  It's like they are waiting for me to bring it up. They have moved on from what was a traumatic event for everyone and expect me to do the same ... not so easy.  What you are feeling is perfectly normal - it's almost like post traumatic stress.  I'm glad you are going to speak to your BCN - it was mine who suggested the counselling and set the ball rolling by referring me.

The feelings of devastation following the initial diagnosis and anxiety waiting for a biopsy and the result were extremely hard to deal with. Your mind takes you to all weird and wonderful places! Once my treatment plan was in place I felt more in control. I am having neo adjuvant chemo prior to a lumpectomy. I have just had my 4th session of EC chemo and will start my first session of Docetaxel followed by my first Herceptin end Sept. Apart from hair loss, nausea and sleep disturbance I have been fairly ok so consider myself fortunate. I am very apprehensive about the side effects of the Docetaxel and any reactions on the first session. I know I will need to just go with it and manage side effects as they present. Surgery will follow and possibly radiotherapy. It's a long journey with good days, bad days emotionally - bit of a roller coaster but overall keeping strong and positive. I would like to hear from anyone who has had the same treatment plan. Sorry about my user name - tried loads more before this but they had been taken so in desperation ha ha. Look forward to chatting later - off to work today. Denise",

I did mention it to the Consultant at my follow up and he didn't seem too concerned but as I was due for my first mammogram he booked it to reassure me.  This all came back clear for which I am extremely thankful. I researched the subject and it seems common for there to be hardening of the tissue surrounding the site of the operation. It's recommended that you use E45 or similar on the area but it can take some time fir the tissue to return to normal.  Denise xx  ",

Fortunately my second surgery was promptly arranged on 23rd December when the remaining tissue and 7 nodes were removed all of which were clear.  I am now onto radiotherapy -10 down 5 to go!  Here's hoping you won't need a second surgery but fore-warned is fore-armed.  Wishing you all the best in your treatment and recovery.  Denise x    ",

      "Content": "Hi all - I am home alone this afternoon and had to vent my opinion.  I just came in from doing some gardening and was browsing through Facebook while having a cuppa.  Someone had put a video on where the person tells their story by holding up cards with words on.  It was a young mum who had gone through breast cancer treatment to then be told it had become secondary and incurable.  Whilst I have great empathy for her situation it depressed me.  As breast cancer patients we are all aware of the risks along the way but strive to stay as positive as possible and face things if and when they arise.   I think this is the only way we can get on with our lives.  All I am saying is that if I thought the video on Facebook was going to help her then I would be all for it but it just brought my mood down.  How do others feel about this?   I met a young mum on my Cancer Survivorship Course and she texted me late one evening as she was struggling and asked if she could come to see me the next evening.  As we are fairly new friends I felt privileged that she had turned to me for support.  She has two children, the youngest being only 2 years old and her Breast lump was originally dismissed as a milk duct.  Although she is on Herceptin and Tamoxifen for 10 years, her Oncologist wants her to have an additional injection (can't recall what the drug is called) every month possibly for life.  This is because she is pre menopausal.  This had knocked her back but we were able to chat and support each other and definitely plan meeting up again.  I do appreciate how it must be even more difficult to deal with when you are diagnosed so young.  Denise xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Lizane I have just read your post - shocking beyond words!  I'm almost in tears imagining how you must have felt being given a terminal diagnosis.  I am delighted for your good news but feel you should seriously take action against the Registrar - it is totally unacceptable and inexcusable.  The wife of someone I work with was also diagnosed by a Registrar who, after referring to a book, told her she had terminal lung and bowel cancer.  That was in 2008 when she was 34 and just after she had given birth to her third child.  As you can imagine it was devastating news.  Well she is still here doing really well and is now having treatment to remove the tumours which she had been told were inoperable! She is an absolute inspiration. Her Oncologist has admitted the Registrar misdiagnosed her and subsequently received a disciplinary at the least.  Also When my daughter's fiancé's dad had skin cancer he was told to put his affairs in order as he had about six weeks to live.  He got a second opinion, cancer was removed and that was 10 years ago!  Do these people realise what they are doing to a person's mental state?  How would they feel being given that diagnosis? To be given a terminal diagnosis is bad enough to come to terms with but to be given it in error is beyond comprehension in my mind.  Sending you hugs and best wishes for your recovery going forward.
