    "Content": "Hi i was just wondering when you are usually told the grade and stage of your cancer. My mum has breast cancer and is having chemotherapy before mastectomy. I live a on opposite side of the country so I am not there at appointments. I just wondered if she should have been told, she has had 2 lots of chemo so far.  I know she probably doesn't want to know but I feel I would like to know.  Thanks",
