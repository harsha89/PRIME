    "Content": "I have extreme pain in my left breast and was referred by my gp to have an ultrasound at a hospital. They could not find anything abnormal in the scan but since then the pain is also in my right breast. The pain is ruining my life it's like a constant throbbing and aching and is making it really difficult to sleep. I have heard of a woman in America with a very similar pain having a double mastectomy and this sorted her problem. Does anyone know if it is possible for me to get a mastectomy on the nhs without having breast cancer or the genetic risk? I would really appreciate help with this! This is making day to day life awful.",
