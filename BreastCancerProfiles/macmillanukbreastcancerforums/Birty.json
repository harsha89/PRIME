      "Content": "Hi Guys, not a good day for me today, things were just starting to look up have felt good since last Thursday woke up in agony this morning so much so it made me cry .... pain in arm where piccline is.  Ended up spending all day in hospital turned out I have a large DVT in my upper arm.  I now have to have daily injections for the next 6-9 months. Am so glad I listened to my instincts as I was arguing with myself this morning on whether i was being paranoid, feeling pain that was not there ... maybe I had led funny on my arm in bed etc etc Not sure if this will affect my next treament but im hoping not am due my second FEC on the 17th June.  Seeing Onco this Friday so i guess i will know more then.  Also not sure about the future of my Piccline whether they will keep that in or not as the line itself isnt causing me any problems.  Was a right sod to get in so wouldnt have another one. Has anyone else had a similar issue? Take care",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, though id drop in and give an update on where I am up to. DVT in arm still giving me grief and am on lots of painkillers for this - apparently it can take 3 weeks before it starts to feel better, I still cannot lift my arm due to the pain it caused in my armpit and upper arm.  Im managing the daily injections okay though. I should have been due 2nd FEC on the 17th June however Oncologist wont allow me to have it because of my DVT, he also said its probable that the piccline needs to come out and advises I have a HIckman line in instead.  Im not sure about this given my current circumstances. I started losing my hair around day 10 post first FEC and its just coming out in clumps all over so lastnight my other half gave me a number 2 so thats that sorted :) only trouble is I cant make my scarf cos i only have i working arm.  Hopefully things will be looking up soon and i can get back on track with my chemo. Hope everyone else is managing their treatment  without as much drama lol xxx",

I had my first FEC a week ago and am still suffering terribly with my tummy its making me really miserable.  Im not even sure what is it, its not nausea, I am going to the toilet albeit with help from Bisacodyl. The only way I can describe it is a very full and uncomfortable feeling in the very upper part of my tummy - the section between my breast and tummy button and my stomach is about 4 sizes bigger than normal.  I feel if  could get this settled I would feel relatively okay.  I am getting to the stage where I am contemplating eating as this only makes me feel more uncomfortable ...... obviously im not going to do that. I am struggling to get a gp appointment so any advice in the meantime would be great. Thanks in advance x",

Any advice on my fingernails? ... my nails are really squidgy? Thanks as always",

      "Content": "Hi, Just wanted to give you some positive news.  I was recently diagnosed with Grade 3 invasive ductal cancer, its also triple negative so treatment options are currently surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I had a radioactive injection this morning followed by a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal and I have to say it was nowhere near as bad as i anticipated it to be. I had worked myself into such a tizzy for nothing - I was treated with respect and dignity and I cannot fault the care and treatment that I have received so far. The treatment options today are excellent and it may be a bit of a tough journey at times but we will come through the other side and are all here to support each other. xx",

The symptoms seem to have settled now (lol nearly time for the fecking next one)  some residual symptoms like ... very sore feet ... strange i know, fatigue and rectal bleeding .... oh the joys :) My periods have also stopped which has made me very weepy I must cry about 10 times each day and dont even know why :)",
