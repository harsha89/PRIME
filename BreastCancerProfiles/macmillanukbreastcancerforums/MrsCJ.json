      "Content": "My husband has to mute the TV or walk away when Macmillan Ads and Cancer Reasearch ads come on. I understand why they have to be there but there must be better tactics than the ads that pull at heartstrings because they're so upsetting if you ARE the cancer sufferer and their family - and yes, I'm being bombarded on fb all the time now with Macmillan ads, because I post on this website.  So sick of \"Brave the Shave\" popping up everywhere. I'll be glad when they move on to the next campaign. Also, I hope they truly have researched the effectiveness of the £25m and are absolutely certain they get that back and more in donations. If they could prove that pulling say, £10m of marketing/fundraising  would reduce donation income by more than £10m, then I might feel a bit happier.",
