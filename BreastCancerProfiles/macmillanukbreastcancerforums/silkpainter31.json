Anyway ,we are now settled ( 4 months later ! ) in our new bungalow in NW Devon. It took a lot of fighting to get a landline too so I've been a bit shell shocked . That said anyone I've been in contact with here has been friendly ,I just need to tackle WI and bowls club now ! I called 111 yesterday (Sat ) at 8.30 & got an appt at North Devon hosp for 9.30. The practice nurse didn't take a culture but I got the feeling she wouldn't be surprised if she saw me back. That said for the last three hours I have felt a marked improvement so I will monitor it . I have my paperwork from last year in Sri Lanka & the meds I was given yesterday are resistant to last years infection ! Maybe it's different ,I can live in hopes .I've been drinking gallons, no coffee etc to the point yesterday when the sample I gave looked like spring water ! The \"lump\" from the last post that they \"found \" on Dec 22nd turned out on Jan  2nd to be scar tissue . I cannot blame them for being thorough , it was my own stupid fault for trying to fit it in before Christmas . The visit was only to say hello ,my GP was worried I'd slip under the radar ,bless her .

Mine lasted for approximately 8 weeks with it being drained every 3 days including a trip to A & E over a weekend . I certainly didn't get bored . Eventually it got infected in spite of everyone's efforts so I was put on antibiotics . They swore blind it wasn't the drugs that dried it up but it was a big coincidence nevertheless ! Hang in there it does go away . My advice is to massage it well and often not allowing the skin to \"stick\" to your chest and do your exercises. Mine did stick and it now pulls when I raise my arm too high . Good luck & hugs xx",

My new GP thought it would be a good idea to have an appt at my new Breast Care Unit to say hello etc... I was diagnosed in August 2015 followed up by mastectomy. On Wednesday this week I got a call ,could I attend tomorrow as they had a cancellation. Off I went yesterday ( Thurs ) thinking I'd get the appt over and then nip off to the supermarket etc.. Wrong . I met the consultant ,answered all relevant questions and then had an exam of scar side & spare boob. He said  \" Was that lump always there ? \" The world stopped . I cannot feel the lump . He called in senior colleague who said after examination that they couldn't do a scan that day but I now have an appt for Jan 2nd. They both said not to worry ( I think I heard that before somewhere !) My response was that they were making me wait over Christmas and New Year , they even wished me \"Happy Christmas\" on my way out ! My husband says I should be pleased/grateful that they are doing their job infinitely better than the last NHS trust . Am I odd to feel so angry that they've turned my life upside down just when we were thinking that 2017 would be our year to get on with retirement ?

I felt like a little old lady ad had lost my get up and go . I know I have OA but I also know the Letrezole has crippled me at times .I've also been told I had fibromyalgia too but I think \"they\" are clutching at straws . Three weeks ago I felt so low I was beginning to wonder if it was all worth it . I mentioned this to a random GP over the phone who probably freaked out ! He put me on 1000mg naproxen daily and the next day I had my life back ,mentally and physically. It's a bit harsh on my stomach but I was told to take Omeprazole twice daily . I also find now I don't always need the full dose . If only I'd been given this two years ago ! Good luck xx",

Why things can't be done in better order God only knows ! Good luck with your op.  The burning is tolerable early in the morning but having to have the wound drained every few days doesn't help, I slosh like a hotwater bottle ! By 6 pm I long for bed !",

I did have SLNB ,with radioactive injection an hour prior to the op.Was told this was to pinpoint nodes for biopsy though, not removal. Anyway , I'll know soon and can then focus on getting that sorted.  thanks again L",

Agony to wear clothes and moving made it worse . I regularly visited this forum and someone suggested that I ask by name for Amytriptylene. It worked and I slept really well too . The pain eased off but for the last few days has returned , obviously as I get feeling back in certain areas . I took one last night and the pain has eased again . Good luck xx",
