    "Content": "Hi Laura  I finished 3 rounds of docetaxol 5 weeks ago.  I found a number of side effects but nothing I couldn't deal with.  I completely lost my sense of taste for a week or so after treatment and lost weight during that time, it's surprising how difficult it is to eat when you can't taste, and I was a lot more tired.  I also found this was cumulative so by the end it took three weeks before I could spend more than a couple of hours out of bed at a time.  Five weeks on I still have to watch what I do but do generally stay up most of the day now.  The other effect has been on my nails and the numbness in my toes which I am told should go. I was told by a friend that Docataxol is 'nasty' so it was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting.  My advice to your Mum is just go with what you feel, if you want to go to bed do, if you want to sit and do nothing then do nothing.  Oh and one more thing I really felt the cold but also get hot flushes so I have bought a couple of zip up fleeces which are easy to put on and off. Hope it all goes well but remember everyone is different xx",
