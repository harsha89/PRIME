      "Content": " Hi Fifi - glad your first session went well. Thanks so much for the info. It was super helpful to hear from someone who has experienced something it, than just reading all the leaflets and websites! My partner will be around for first chemo for sure. I just want to get it all started now, though I am dreading it too. Will let you know how first one goes too and will check out the chemo group. Hope 2nd and beyond ECs are similarly ok for you. You take care too!   ",

      "Content": "Hi Fifi - I also start EC chemo in a bit for 6 cycles. Just waiting to hear from hospital for the first 'date'. Would be lovely (if that is the right word) to share our experiences.Enjoy the super bikes and I hope your first day of EC was okay. This is my first post so thank you for starting this one (not sure I would have taken the plunge otherwise!) ",
