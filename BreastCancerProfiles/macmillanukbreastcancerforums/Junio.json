    "Content": "I know how you are feeling. I had a lumpectomy in 2013, chemo, Radiotherapy, Herceptin. In August last year after a routine mammogram I was informed I had cancer again in the same place. They could not confirm if it was a new cancer or a recurrence. I\u2019ve been through a mastectomy, chemo and now going through Herceptin again. Like you my head was all over the place and I went into meltdown. I\u2019ve bounced back and now living life the best I can and remain positive for a good outcome. I\u2019m now looking forward to my breast reconstruction and having new perky boobs to be envied. I hope all turns out well for you and you get good news. I was told by my oncologist that it is very rare for it to come back in the same place after all of the treatment. Good luck and best wishes.",
