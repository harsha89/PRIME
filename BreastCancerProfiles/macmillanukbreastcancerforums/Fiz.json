      "Content": "Mum has secondary breast cancer, spread to the liver, a little in the bones and possibly lungs and larynx. She's currently in hospital ( Charing Cross) with pneumonia, following various courses of chemo over the last 2 years. We are all think it's best to give the chemo a break now ( well, we may not have the choice, she can't even eat or drink now or talk, is fed from a drip), but we don't know whether this is down to the cancer or to the chemo. She' s had xrays and ct scans of the head and chest, but nothing is explaining why she can't swallow anything and keep food down. Does anyone have any similar experiences? Also, I've heard that chemo can often make the cancer grow back more aggressively, does anyone know about this? Mum is 72 but a fighter.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies. I am new to this forum and am finding it comforting in these hours of distress. The doctors today told me that the MRI scan was showing signs of a stroke, but no cancer; but he said given my mum's situation, it is still likely to be the cancer and this is not good news.The only way to confirm is by a lumbar puncture, which is unadvisable as she can't have a general anaesethic in her condition. Even if it is the cancer, she can't have any more chemo, she just can't take it. Unfortunately, the doctor said if that's the case, it's only a matter of weeks. I am praying for strength to get through this but am really struggling.",
