      "Content": "I have been having pains in my legs /groin/lower back for months. Went to see my GP and her referred me to Musculo Skeletal team. I had a thorough examination and was referred for MRI scan,which i had yesterday (1/3) afternoon.This afternoon the lady who i saw at Musculo Skeletal rang me, there was no major concern with my back,but there are things she needs to discuss with me regarding pelivs and hip, and she also threw into the mix I have a mass on my right ovary,for which she has referred me back to my GP for him to refer me to Gynae.   Am I being a fruit cake worrying that the results came back so quick and that i cause for concern regarding it all? I have app to see Musculo lady on Tuesday,and am to ring my GP Monday to give him time to read the report she has sent to him. I am in turmoil now. What next can happen, after getting over BC and getting on with life I have this spanner thrown into the works. ",

Keep strong and take one day at a time,YOU are the most important one at this time. Get the rads out the way and then focus on everything else,it is tiring enough without having to cope with other issues. As for the cream, I used E45 and aloe Vera which helped me with the slight burn. Hope you can keep your pecker up and we are all here for you at anytime x Good luck xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, Just to give an update. After waiting 4 weeks for bone can results to be told it had to go to MDT meeting which was today, I finally got a call from my BCN to tell me that there were \"hot spots\" on my ribs,chest wall and shoulder and that a CT scan was needed for further imaging before a diagnosis can be made. So now have to wait for that appointment to come through (which will be within the next 2 weeks) and await that result!! Although she did say that once i had had it,to let her know and she will chase the results up. Been scared witless for weeks thinking today i would get to know what's happening, and now i'm even more worried. am i reading too much into it do you think??  Thanks Elaine #waitingdrivesuscrazy",

The last week or so I have been having severe pain both in my arm and the affected breast. Would you see the GP or call the breast care nurses? Only asking because my oncologist always says any pain see your GP. Thanks for any advice",

Now i'm scared there is something wrong which my oncologist deemed not fit to look into. My mum was diagnosed too late for treatment and passed away 9 days after diagnosis.
