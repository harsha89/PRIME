      "Content": "I was diagnosed with DCIS with micro invasion and 2 weeks ago had a WLE and SLNB. Unfortunately my results showed that the surgeon did not get a clear margin and I will get further surgery on 18 February. Coupled to this I was told that two nodes were removed which showed micromets. I was advised that I would get radiotherapy to my underarm also now and for a longer period than first discussed. I will also get medication. Hearing hat the cancer spread to my nodes is really worrying me. Has anyone had a similar experience.",

      "Content": "Hi there. I had a mastectomy in April with LD reconstructive surgery. As my breasts were quite large and a bit droopy, I was offered a lift/reduction on my other side which I had carried out at the same time. I am delighted with the outcome of my surgery as my breasts are the same size and it does make it easier to get fitting bras! I have healed very well and have got to say that I prefer my shape now and would therefore recommend it. Hope this helps. X",
