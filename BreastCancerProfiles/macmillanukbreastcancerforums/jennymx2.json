      "Content": "Hi Tessa I had FEC when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in '07. It's the Epirubicin that causes the hair loss. I couldn't bear the thought of a cold head and all the extra time spent at the hospital so I bought lots of hats and headscarves and decided on the 'hippy chick' look for the summer. As soon as the treatment stopped, my hair started to regrow. I experimented with headbands until the hairline had come down a bit. I finished chemo at the end of June and had my first haircut just before Christmas. I have just had radiotherapy to my head and my hair has all gone again. No choice of cold cap this time! As I didn't have time to tell a lot of people and we have lots of events to go to over the summer, I decided to get a wig ( plus I have been down this road before)! I have just got one from a lovely salon in Worthing called 'Robertsons'. They were extremely helpful and my kids can't notice the difference from my real hair. Good luck with the treatment. Just take one step at a time. Jennym",

      "Content": "I have had a PICC line now for 9 months and have been trying to get a portacath under the NHS as I am on Herceptin for life. It is so inconvenient having the line in for long term use. I had one before, but knew that it would only be in for a maximum of 6 months, so could cope with that. I have seen my M.P. who has contacted the P.C.T. and my G.P. has also written, but nearly 3 months later, I am still waiting for a reply. It just seems so unfair that we are given extra problems to worry about when we are trying to fight this horrible disease. Does anyone have any advice as to how to get things sorted?",
