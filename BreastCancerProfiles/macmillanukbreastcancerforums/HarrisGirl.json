    "Content": "Hi,  Just wanted to add to your thread hun as I'm also 31 and was diagnosed with high grade DCIS last month.  I'm due to have my mastectomy on the left side this Thursday.  I think everyone deals with it all so differently and coping strategies vary. I personally manage far better when I can get out the house with the family (I'm a stay at home mum to a 2 yr old girl). Also just generally taking care of myself, plenty of me time where possible doing things I like and trying to talk about how I feel with my partner and family regularly. This stops my mind working over time to a certain extend. To be honest though these things only get you so far. I just try to remember that it's all seemingly in hand and I'll deal with whatever is thrown my way because I'm not having my quality of life ruined by something I didn't ask for.  I hope everything goes well for you",
