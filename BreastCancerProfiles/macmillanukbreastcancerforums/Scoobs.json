    "Content": "Hi I too suffered with some mouth ulcers on the right side of my tongue...... bloody nuisance.  I made sure I brushed my teeth about 4 times a day (including my tongue very gently), and ensured I used a soft toothbrush.  This really helped for me and they disappeared within about 3 days.  I have read that some people also use Bonjela to soothe. Hope this helps Sue xx",
