      "Content": "Hi Pointer,  Sending you tons of hugs, it's difficult in the early stages when so much is unknown although for you that it's small and lymph glands are clear is good news. I think emotions go up and down - track back a few days and you'll see a thread I started about emotions where many lovely ladies posted their thoughts about emotions and reactions. Now I've had my SNB two days ago I keep forgetting that I've got BC and there's more to come for me of whatever sort and waiting for the lymph nodes result and every so often think \"ooh, they could find something unexpected. I've barely cried, been too practical, expect it will hit me some time. And yet I'm a big cry baby as a rule. Try to be positive, treatments can be/are very good, millions of ladies are ok in the end, just a difficult road to travel and notwithstanding any family/friends you have, there are others in your situation, similar or not, that you can reach out to - this forum is becoming like a second home, more so than the hospitals we have to visit too often - my calendar looks so busy! Try to enjoy the good weather this weekend, think of all the things and people you love, cuddle someone or something, take up voodoo and let out your feelings. Take care, Jane x ",

      "Content": "Hi MummyBH As a self-confessed scaredy cat of anything that might hurt, I was worried about my first mammogram at the beginning of May but really each boob took only 5 seconds to be mammographed. It was not painful at all, just a bit uncomfortable having them squished between the xray plates. Having had quite a few mammograms and biopsies recently (both via ultrasound and mammogram) feel free to ask me any questions if you want to and I can describe my experiences of these to you, which were not horrible and there were very few tears shed from this scaredy cat (the few tears I did shed were from being anxious, not pain). Hope you can feel reassured from all the replies here and don't be scared about the upcoming appointment, as was said earlier, they like to be efficient and saves you having to wait too long to be seen. And don't worry about going on your own to the mammogram if need be. I did, for both original and the later biopsies, and all of the nurses and radiologists took good care of me and were very understanding and kind. Best wishes Jane x",

The lady doing my radioactive isotope really understood my fear of needles and allowed my BF to be with me when it was performed. All medical staff I have dealt with for this on both sides have been great and understanding. Two weeks without a shower? Crumbs, that's harsh. I'm sure you have things in place but cleansing wipes are fabulous, both for cleaning and refreshing intimate parts and generally all over - although it's possible to get through quite a few, and they're good for cooling off parts of the body in the heat. I'm using Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes and many of the supermarkets/pharmacies have them on offers such as 2 for 1 or save so much if buying a multi-pack. They could become a regular on my grocery list! Hugs to you and wishing you a speedy recovery x",

      "Content": "GOOD NEWS Lymph nodes are clear. Had more discussion with my surgeon about the mastectomy and options for reconstruction. Decided on an LD (back flap) recon, no implant, and then further surgery at a later date with lipo filling (taking fat from my tummy and injecting into the breast). This would be done 3 months after the mx op and potentially again another 3 months later depending on how the size goes, with an aim to try and get the new left breast to a similar size/shape as the good right one. No guarantee this would give immediate symmetry but more natural and less risk than implants (I know many women have successful implants but I'm not so keen on them). I could always choose an implant as the last option if the others don't give a result I'm comfortable with but it feels better to me to do it over time and see how it goes. Surgeon doesn't think he can get enough muscle/fat/tissue from my back during the mx/recon to match my new left breast to my remaining right one hence the lipo option. And unless anything unanticipated is found during mx, won't need RT or chemo and probably not any hormone treatment either! So mastectomy is booked for 16th August. 4-5 days in hospital and 3 months recovery. Something to look forward to Main thing is a) getting rid of that nasty little (5cm - little?!) invader and b) knowing when that will happen. Despite going private it does feel as if it's been a long journey so far but I worked out it's 65 days since my first mammogram, 42 days since the diagnosis of DCIS and 14 days since the SNB. So just another 43 days to wait. I could have chosen 30th July but that would mean me and my boyfriend wouldn't be able to attend his niece's wedding at the seaside on 4th August where we've booked the weekend down so that will be a nice pre-op treat. Seeing my GP on 17th July when my sick note ends so will try to decide by then if I want to be signed off until the op (and beyond for recovery) or go back to work for 2-3 weeks. I work from home so it's not physical but very busy and stressful. Might decide to chill out and relax for those weeks and investigate the Latissimus Ladies Luncheon Club - my BCN gave me a card with contact details for 2 ladies who had LD flap recon done by my surgeon. Hope your last RT went ok Leolady56 and that you survived Tesco! Onwards and upwards! Jane.",

Just conjuring up visions of you whipping your wig off at your neighbours. Up and down is probably par for the course with BC, or any other major situation, it's easier though when there are loved ones, physically or virtually around to help us through and let us be who we are, not what we are defined by BC. I applaud you for your middle name although I've never cared for my own name but at least my father overruled my mother and prevented me being called Frances - he didn't want the kids at school calling me Fanny!  ;-) Last night sleep was my friend, didn't sleep much longer than usual but I was very sound asleep for nearly 7 hours although I had had maximum strength Ibuprofen 3 hours before bed and Co-codamol 1 hour before bed as the anaesthetic was wearing off and my wound was feeling very tender and sore. They were my knockout drops in tablet form but I'm only taking the tabs absolutely when the pain/discomfort is too much. But it's only a wound from SNB so minor compared what I may get after an mx/recon and totally different I'm sure from anything experienced by other ladies from chemo or RT. Anyway, chin up for a happy weekend to you if that's possible, the sunshine is good for the mood although not necessarily the heat. Today I'm being a bit nursemaid to the BF as he's suffering with an upset stomach from last night's pizza - that's the 2nd time from that pizza company so they're now banned. But he's still watching me like a hawk and won't let me do certain things that would involve reaching up with my left arm. Onwards and upwards. Jane x",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, Saw my surgeon yesterday, SNB dressing has been removed and is looking good. Results of SNB won't be ready till next Thursday 5th July but surgeon is optimistic of good news and 3 nodes were removed. Outcome is still most likely mx with immediate LD back flap recon - surgeon thinks because of the size and shape of my boobs (they're a bit droopy) that an implant alone won't give a visible good shape and would have a very odd looking pair. Anyway, that's for another time... I will ask the same question to my BCN later but can any of you recommend if using any cream on the wound and area is a good idea, such as Savlon or E45 or something similar as it does feel still a bit sore and sometimes itchy. I also occasionally get sharp twinges in the area but usually after I'm up and moving around after having sat for a while, such as after watching TV. I am taking Ibuprofen and Co-codamol up to 3 times a day per instructions. Thanks for any tips and hope all is good for you. Jane x",

      "Content": "So for those interested, here's the story of my SNB yesterday following a diagnosis of high grade DCIS in my left breast and because I in the wimp club for medical stuff! Had the Sentinel Node Biopsy op yesterday as planned, which was also my first ever operation and first ever general anaesthetic. Before that I went to the Medical Physics Department to have a radio active injection. My boyfriend was allowed in there with me for it and I squeezed his hand very tight whilst both he and the nurse told me to breathe. I tend to tense a lot and hold my breath inadvertently due to anxiety with needles! Then off to the private hospital, admitted and lots of simple tests and discussions. Told the nurse my fear of injections and the canula but I managed it very well, as they applied some Emla cream to my hand to anaesthetise it before inserting the canula so was pain free (I am very needle phobic and that's now marked on my medical records!). The anaesthetic lady was very very nice and funny and said the GA would be Gin & Tonic so I joked back Vodka and Diet Coke please and she wrote it on my notes! In the room where I had the GA they mentioned about it being time for the Vodka and Diet Coke. I remember being asked where I lived and where I am originally from them knew nothing. Had a great sleep during the op and came round well albeit confused which amused my BF (I kept asking questions about if it had been done or not!) when I was back in my room. First thing I remember was being shouted at in the recovery room to wake up! Rested well in my hospital room (peace and quiet in a private hospital (like a hotel) than a noisy general NHS ward) until they discharged me about 7.30pm last night and I came home. I ate well and soon after the op - egg mayo sandwich and chocolate fudge cake - hospital has a great menu! Felt weary but stayed awake till midnight, had a restless sleep last night, and this morning just feel a bit woozy and weary, but numbness and discomfort where the incision was under my left armpit. Have a fabulous big purple bruise there, and a blue dye stain on my left breast (radioactive dye to help identification of lymph nodes). I am now a Smurf! On strict instructions to rest up for the coming days and not doing any heavy lifting (can't even lift the kettle yet with my left hand and that will be my gauge to when things are good but not rushing it and not going to push too hard -but will be doing some exercises as per details I have from the hospital) I will see my surgeon next Wednesday 27th to have the dressing removed, review things and hopefully see if the results are back on the lymph nodes so crossing fingers they are clear. But results could be another week after that. Depending on outcome then consultant will hopefully make plans for the bigger op but exact details as yet unknown depending results although so far mastectomy will be it. I know what I would like to have done (mx and immediate recon, probably LD but to be decided) but I will take his advice for what choices there could be and that are feasible. But whatever it will be, I now know I can manage for a general anaesthetic (as long as I get my lovely Emla cream first!). Will see how things go. Day by day. Very proud of myself that I coped so well yesterday, I always said I had most apprehension about the first op than anything else but managed it! BF described me as being in a state of euphoria afterwards which I don't think was just the drugs. Have maximum strength Ibuprofen and Co-Codamol to be taken only when required. Had Ibuprofen before bed last night, may see about another this morning but taking it step by step. My BF is being a diamond, he was in my hospital room for 8 hours yesterday before, during and after my op and only left it once to go to the coffee machine. During the op he chilled out and watched a film on the room TV. So... so far so good and taking it easy, there's more to come of some sort at some time but I'll manage. THANK YOU ALL so much for all the kind words of encouragement and masses amount of info that helped me prepare so well. For those of you in recovery, in the middle of or starting your journey, I will you all the best and send hugs to you all. Jane xxx",
