      "Content": "Hi all, I'm 17 and a few months ago I found a lump in my breast. I thought I'd just ignore it and it'd go away but it hasn't. It doesn't seem to have grown at all in size and isnt that painful, I know that breast cancer is quite rare in girls my age but I'm still worried and dont know how to tell anyone/even a doctor. Any advice from someone who's felt the same would be hugely appreciated Thanks",
