      "Content": "Hi everyone My mum noticed she had an inverted nipple the other day she's 67 - she was born with one but this one has just appeared - so she went to the GP who gave her a physical exam under her arms and her breasts etc. He said he couldn't find anything else so told her to come back again in 3 months. With cancer being the way it is and time being of the essence when it comes to treatment. Is this normal to be told to come back in 3 months or should she have had further tests? It would be great if someone could offer any advice? Thanks on advance Roland",
