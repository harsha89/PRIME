    "Content": "Hi Annie I know how you feel regarding secondaries.  I had a whole month of testing for invasive lobular breast cancer, which came back positive.  I thought my cancer was only in my breast.  However, on an MRI bone scan, I had secondaries in my bones. Came as a shock to me and my family.  I was all up for going through chemo, etc, being off work for a good few months etc, but that has all changed.  I am now on hormone therapy to shrink the lump in my breast as a measurement for treatment to see if it is working.  My oncologist has assured me that there are so many treatments available, changing all the time and that she will offer me everything going.  I was scared at the time as well, but now I have got my head round everything and feel better about things.  My Stage IV cancer is not curable as it has spread, but it can be managed.   I am now about to go back to work, am going on holiday and 'managing' my cancer secondaries.  Apparently we can live a long and happy life with treatment, so please do not despair/panic.  Please be assured that the secondaries can be managed.  I have only had this diagnosis for 2 months now, taking the medications and am functioning normally, am happy and taking each day as it comes.  Everyone seems to be frightened by the word 'secondaries' but my doctor and oncologist have assured me that there are so many different treatments nowadays to help us.   Best wishes, Panela",
