    "Content": "Hi there i have been diagnosed with paraaortic retrocavel lymphdopanthy after having a kidney removed in March, they have questioned marked metasis, and they were not expecting to see it, it has caused a 12cm lesion to appear, I had no idea I had this as no swelling only occasionally, mostly at night I would get a tight pulling sensation, tingling, and spontaneous leg jerking down one side, which I put down to restless legs  the docs have decided to give me 4 cycles of chemo, cisplatin & gembicitine to hopefully kill off any cancer cells that may be causing the node to react, off which I have had one  cycle, all other areas clear of cancer as of early May this year, only a couple of non descript lung nodules which are stable and have been since February this year, I have encountered no symptoms with the lung nodules as of yet fingers crossed they are just that  as as of yet I haven't been given any advice as to lymphomadena I guess they are just waiting to see how it reacts to chemo, but the link provided was useful, I am seeing my consultant next Monday so hopefully he can shed some light   wishing you well jukie    ",
