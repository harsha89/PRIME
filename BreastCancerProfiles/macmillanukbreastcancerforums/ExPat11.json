    "Content": "Hi Sorry you're having such a bad time with the nausea.  My husband suffered badly after his chemo (different type/site, but same awful reaction to the treatment).  Unfortunately, they can only guess at what drugs might work, so start off using the most commonly effective ones - and these didn't work at all for him.  The hospital told us to let them know straight away if the drugs didn't work and he still had nausea - and not to assume that it was \"just something you have to live with\" (which used to be the case, years ago, and is what we'd heard from a few people!).  They said that anti-nausea drugs have improved hugely over the last few years, and almost everyone can find a combination that takes all or most of it away. But you have to let them know, and then again if the new combination doesn't work.  We let them know straight away, and we tried at least three different combinations of meds (over the course of a week or two), before we got something that worked well.  He still had some nausea, but it was managable, and he wasn't throwing up. Good luck, and let us know how you get on.",
