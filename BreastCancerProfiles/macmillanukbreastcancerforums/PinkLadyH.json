Mostly managed okay with paracetamol. Coming off steroids after day 3 did \u2018crash\u2019 me a bit, and I\u2019ve had some indigestion/constipation but seem to be on the mend today. My hair is still there, for a few days at least! Next dose is 20/12 so am hoping for similar so that we can have a decent Christmas Day, then one in January and onto 3 lots of docetaxel.  I\u2019ve got bisphosphonates every other dose and then radiotherapy and ten years of hormones to look forward to, all seems a bit daunting but needs must!",

      "Content": "Hi all I\u2019ve been reading with interest- I have my second EC tomorrow. I've had no problems with veins from round one, but as I\u2019ve already had surgery (mastectomy and full ANC) and have cording around my lymph vessels on my right side, there is only my left to use for the injections. My oncologist was very decisive at my first appointment with her that if I had any vein problems she would immediately go for a PICC line, to limit any cording on my \u2018good\u2019 side. I hope I won\u2019t need that, but it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s an option. Fingers crossed that round 2 is as straightforward as round 1 - apart from the constipation I had very few SEs. Best of luck and good wishes to everyone xxx",
