Also leave feet outside covers to cool down. Avoid anything with caffeine in such as coke cola, coffee, chocolate and energy drinks. Hope this helps. I have just started on Anastrazole my menopausal hot flushes have stopped but Anastrazole may bring them on again.",

I have had DCIS twice in the last 6 years. It is oestrogen induced only and both times caught very early but as 7 women in my family have had breast cancer the offer of Anastrazole has been suggested. Anyone any thought or suggestions.",

      "Content": "I have had bread cancer twice. The first time I sailed through it with no worries. I was positive about everything. The second time I fell apart for awhile. I was convinced I was going to die and had not one positive thought. Everyone reacts differently and it is quiet understandable to feel the way you do. I found taking it one day at a time helps to keep positive. The big C word is enough to frighten anyone. Take care and good luck. X",

      "Content": "Hi. I only had radiotherapy for three weeks but I felt lost when everything stopped. I was told it was a form of grief and it was quite normal. I also felt very intolerant of people around me who were in a major stress over, what seemed to me, such trivial things. Again the anger was another stage of grief. I personally felt that the emotional side of cancer was far worse than anything else. Now it is past I feel a better calmer person and see life as something that needs to be lived to the greatest extent. I hope this helps. X",
