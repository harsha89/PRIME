      "Content": "Hi Jet My husband was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma back in September. We are now coming to the end of the begining, as it were. He is due to go into hospital a week on Monday and all being well he should be having his operation this time in two weeks time. It is all very scary. However, one of the best sites I have found is this http://headcase.20six.co.uk/headcase/archivebymonth It is a blog by a young man who had his operation serval years ago. He gives so much information about the process he went through and it is all done in a very entertaining way, he is funny. Also I would look at the British Acoustic Neuroma Association - I haven't subscribed though so I cant comment on what that is like. it has been me that has read all about it. I know more now than I need or want to know, but that is how I am. Info, info info! My husband hasn't read anything or looked into anything. He doesn't want to know anything. Hope that bit of info is of use Take care Edith",

      "Content": "Hi Jet I am pleased to hear that you have told your husband. I know he must have found it hard to deal with, but in my oppinion, looking at this from the other half's side, you have done the best thing. Don't know if it will help but the thing that I have kept in my mind is if my husband had to get a brain tumour this is the one/one of the ones??? to get. We are close to his operation now. It should be next week. I wish it was this time next week, or even better this time in a fortnight. What hospital are you going to? Edith",

      "Content": "Hi Both Sorry I haven't been around my husband had his AN removed on Tuesday. Not a day I want to do again. But anyway, all went well. He is home J He is still a bit wobbly on his legs and dizzy. But he was before as that was one of the symptoms. One of our big worries was that the removal would cause a facial palsy. It has a little bit, but his left eye and lid still move so this seems to be a good sign. He can only do a half smile though. Apart from that he has a lovely scar that runs all the way round the back of his ear. He looks a bit like Frankenstein\u2019s Monster at the minute because it is held together with metal clips, like staples. Nearly had a hitch yesterday. Hospital said clips in his head should come out on Monday and those in his stomach on Thursday (they took a bit of skin and fat and stuff from his stomach to patch his head \u2013 not quite as simple as that but you get the idea) So I rang the doctor. Receptionist said I haven\u2019t got any appointments, so I said what do I do then take a pair of pliers to him myself? She seemed to get the sense of urgency when I told her they were to come out of his head. So upshot is that nurse id going to fit him in in her break. He is very tired at the minute but that is understandable. He is sleeping now. I think he thought that he would have his operation and would be doing cartwheels down the ward the next day. I think that he has realised that it is not going to be that quick. He is a lot happier now he is at home. They couldn't do the radiation thing on him as it was too big and pressing on his brain stem. So they took it out. So I don\u2019t know what the side effects of the radiation are. Sorry to hear about Mother in Law, the dog and the PLO. You two don\u2019t do things by halves do you! J I hope you have a lovely time on holiday  All the best both Edith",

      "Content": "Hi Both Reading your stories certainly puts things into perspective I don't know what I am whinging about I need to pull myself together and get a grip. My husband has his op at Queens Medical in Nottingham. As they are such rare things they only do the operations, if that is what you need at selected hospitals - how does if feel to be one in a million? :-) Actually I think it is about 13 in a million. You may find you don't need an op. From what I understand and have been told if they are small enough they can zap them with things called gamma knives. They sound like something out of Dr Who. Or some times they just leave them and watch to see what happens. They grow very slowly. They think my husband has had his for somewhere between 10 and 15 years. His is too big to leave or zap so he is having it taken out. Talking of husbands, you really need to tell your husband about this. Coming at this from the other side, i.e. the person who is not the one that is ill, I can tell you that he needs to know. Although we are not the ones that have to cope with the illness, treatment etc we have our  stuff to deal with and some of that is helping our partners deal with what ever comes. I have been with my husband to all the appointments while they looked at what was causing his symptoms. The scariest I think was to see the neurologist after the MRI. However, he explained that it is benign and if you are going to have a brain tumour then this is the one to have. Its not easy to deal with, but I don't have to tell either of you that. You two know far more about dealing with stuff like this than I do. But he needs to know. Your doctors will be the best people to advise you on your condition but if I can help by sharing wany of my experiences over the past couple of months then please let me know. Best regards to both of you Edith",

      "Content": "Hi Both How did your first day back at work go Tess? Hope all was well and indeed you remembered to keep your clothes on J Are you all set for your holiday? It will be nice if you can get across into Israel. I am not religious, but would love to go to Jerusalem. I\u2019m not a beach and sun tan lotion sort of person. I just get hot and bored. I prefer having a look round and where better than one of the most important historical cities in the world. Jet have you had a meeting with a neurosurgeon yet? They would be the best person to advise you of the course of action for your AN. From what we were given to understand there are three courses of treatment. Watch and wait for really small ones that are doing no damage. Just an MRI every so often. Zap it with radiation to kill it if it is small enough but has to go. Surgery I believe is only where it is large and is causing damage. This is what happened to my husband as it was pressing on his brain stem. Get every opinion from anyone that has any information to give you is my advice. The problem we have found is that most of the medical people say \u201cit depends\u201d I understand that there is no answer to the question of what will happen because they don\u2019t know. But it doesn\u2019t stop you wanting an answer. My husband is still doing well and despite his wonky face is still as handsome as ever. Though his face is coming back to a more symmetrical look. There is still some swelling on the outside, so what it is like on the inside, goodness knows! They also took some fat from his stomach to pad the wound behind his ear, so the bruising there and at the top of his legs give the impression that he has been run over by a bus. They are currently every colour under the rainbow. He has had all of the clips out now so things are starting to heal. It is early days yet and despite his inability to smile on both sides of his face, it is looking good. His eye closes, which in some instances they don\u2019t and he is starting to get pins and needles in his face. I just think that he needs to be patient, something that doesn\u2019t come easily to him. He is waiting for an appointment with the physio / occupational therapy team. There is not much anyone can do at the minute his body needs a chance to heal itself before any work is done. Trying to get him to understand that is hard work. Hope all is well with both of you Edith",

      "Content": "Hi Tess and Jet Hope all went well this morning Jet and you have had at least some of your questions answered. I know how you feel, its all a bit confusing and scary. There are so many things you want to know and a lot of things that you don\u2019t realise you need to know until you talk to the doctor. You seem to be suffering Tess. Forgive the ignorance but what does ER positive mean? Will the PE have any effect on you flying? My husband is doing well. No appointments as yet. He is waiting for the physio therapy team to get him an appointment so that they can work on his face. I also understand that we will need to go back to see the neuro-surgeon when everything settles down a bit. Apart from that I don\u2019t think he needs anything else. His balance is back, but because half of his face, and consequently his eye don\u2019t work properly his perspective is a bit off and he can see double. I think that should go though. All the best Edith",

      "Content": "Hi Jet That's great news. My husband had to have the operation because his was too big and causing problems but yours sounds as if it is just a teeny weeny one :-)  I am really pleased for you. When you say you will stay over for the 6 weeks of zapping does that mean that you will have to be in hospital all that time!!! Still even though it is long winded it is better than the op. Although my husband seems to have come out of it quite well there are side effects. Take care both Edith",
