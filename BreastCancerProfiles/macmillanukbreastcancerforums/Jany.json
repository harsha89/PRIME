    "Content": "I had a mastectomy with immediate LD reconstruction in November 2005, I found the op  much to my surprise to be pain free Its a shame you were unable to do the exercises post op that would have helped.  Get your husband to mas sarge it  that helps as well.  Why don't you give your breast care nurse a ring and see if she can suggest something, they are usually very helpful. Hope things improve. Take care. Jan        ",
