    "Content": "Good Evening I had my first 3 through a cannula at the same time as my chemo.  The first one I had as an injection did sting a bit (certainly didn't hurt alot) , the nurse put it quite far down my leg. For the next two I had a paracetamol and Piriton one hour before, relaxed and asked the nurse to inject nearer the top of my leg and it was pretty much painless. regards Kath ",
