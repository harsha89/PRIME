    "Content": "Hi Claire-Marie I was diagnosed in May 06 and then again in Oct 08 and am 40 years old.  LIke you the powers that be decided that I should go down the ovary shut down route and I chose the operation.  I had it done by keyhole surgery and it was a very quick operation, an hour or so from memory.  I stayed in overnight as you can get referred pain in your left shoulder (dont ask me why) and so it was good to be looked after.  Had it done 6pm and was out the following morning.  On painkillers for a few days and couldn't drive for a few days either from memory.  Obviously, you are then straight in the menopause and the hot flushes can hit you a lot harder as they have been turned off overnight.  I didn't suffer too badly - maybe because of everything else going on or maybe because I was living in australia and was hot anyway. Tamoxifen didn't work for me so was on other hormone treatment - that would all depend on what was recommended. Good luck, don't hesitate to come back with questions. Cheers Coogee x    ",
