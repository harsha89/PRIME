    "Content": "Hi Vicky - or anyone who can offer advice, I have had 6 sessions of chemo and then a gap of 4 months for surgery. Will soon be starting another 6 sessions. Meanwhile, my hair has thinned and gone baby fine in texture and sadly totally white. I am about to have it cut short to improve the look of it and would love to add some colour but cannot get any firm advice on whether this will totally damage my hair. I asked Trevor Sorbie (founder of chaity mynewhair.com) months ago and he said the damage to hair is inside the body so anything you do outside wouldn't  affect it. I wouldn love to add a bit of warmth back into my hair - what do you think?   Carol",
