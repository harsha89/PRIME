Just one thought from me on private health care.  My father (who used to be a hospital consultant) advised me against it for my first cancer, if your treatment plan involves complex, long surgery. Exactly the same surgeons operate in the NHS as the private sector. So the quality is the same. But the difference is if anything goes wrong.  If you are in a NHS hospital you will have all the other specialists on hand. Not nice to think about, and Im just about to have a long operation myself. But it is reassuring to know.  And the NHS cancer care is fantastic (mostly) And as everyone has told you, what you are feeling is a natural reaction. It will get better once you have a plan for the next stage, and can focus on that xxx",

The BRCA 1 and 2 mutated genes are fairly rare <1% in the general population, I think. So for most of us even with a strong family history the cause is never known.  Just flipping unlucky xxx",

I was recently genetically tested for breast cancer but they only looked for the mutations of BRAC1 and  BRAC2; I  was not positive for either. But they didnt test for Palb2 - my genetics nurse told me they could not go beyond BRAC1/2 yet. As Leolady56 says, there may be other ladies that come along with experience of this.  But if its risk reducing surgery they want to do, I would discuss with your medical team the urgency of such a major decision before you have had time to consider the risk and benefits.  BRAC1 and BRAC2 mutant genes have well evidence risk factors associated with them. But I dont know about Palb2. Do speak to your medical team and BCN nurse as they need to give you the information to help you make this decision. And it is always your decision.  Hugs from me too xx . ",

      "Content": "Hi Scootergirl  I had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (silicon implant)  17 years ago. My surgeon at the time said it should last around 10-15 years.  Mine is still okay, but getting harder.  In am now back on the breast cancer train and had an operation to remove a lump in my good breast on 16 Feb. Im still waiting for the results of the pathology from that one to determine next stage of treatment (results next Wednesday as they have been delayed - another story). At the appropriate point, I plan to ask my surgeon about my foob and how much longer it might last and what they usual do (ie  if eventually it will need replacing and how that might happen). I will tell you what he says.. I think your GP is being unfair. Your implant is not purely cosmetic. Its to help you deal with the devastating affects of this dreadful disease. Looking at it will be a daily reminder of what you went through in 1997.  Mine is a dome shape but looks perfectly normal in a bra.  I would write back to them setting out your concerns and as others say, with any information that is useful. I still have the consent form I had to sign for my implant which is clear that they are not 'lifetime devises and revision surgery may be needed'.  The decision about whether you want to have further surgery if that is needed, must be up to you. But if your implant has moved, than surely the NHS should offer that option.   Sorry this is long, but your post prompted a reaction from me and I am happy to help in any way.  Just a thought, it might be worth ringing the breast caner nurse team in your local hospital to see what they think. There will be a general number and they may have dealt with similar cases before. xx",

My first reaction was i cant let work down, its too short notice.  So I said I couldnt make it: next appointment is not until 16 April given Easter.  Rang my friend, who said put yourself first, ring them back immediately and say yes.  By the time I'd done this - it was too late, nuclear medicine had gone home.  So it now means a) I have to wait longer for the result of this stage; b) it  will delay my mastectomy and reconstruction ops; and c) it will probably put my holiday at risk, big grrr.  Fizzing mad at myself, but whats done is done.  So time for some positive feet to be put forward .....  Hope anyone who can  gets some fresh air this weekend even if its just sticking your head out of the window to see spring starting to struggling through. And thanks jmp for the fab 1960 and 70s children's TV photos, thats my era.  Now one more quick burst of Helen Shapiro before I jump into action  No reply needed - just needed to externalize my silly thoughts ",

Loved it and had to give it up at 11 years old (even though it was still running perfectly) as mum mum could no longer get in and out of it as it was too low. Hoping to keep this one for many years.  Like using public transport too - but even though I live in a city, my local bus service is now reduced from every 10 mins, to 30 mins - grrr (I formally objected!!) Planning a dog walk round a local reservoir this afternoon.  Havent done this walk this year yet (too muddy). But my dog loves a swim and its good for that, and there is a nice pub close by xxx",

Hope you a feeling better.  As others have said it may the heat and dehydration. I had a spell were I felt regularly faint and it turned out my iron levels were very very low. So worth getting checked out if they continue as there may be an underlying (simple) explanation. Good for you moomy on getting out for a walk. Wow Amalie on your boating adventure.

I found out my BMI today at the pre-op, Im now officially overweight, first time ever (eek).  Whilst I need enough for my two new DIEP boobs, Ive taken the surgeon's advice not to lose any weight to the extreme! Decided I will have to loose a little bit of this excess weight during my mx recovery period in the summer, before I have the reconstruction. And of course will be keeping up the walking when Im fit enough.  moomy - THANK YOU for the ice cream photos.  Yum yum. Just got some Ben and Jerry's out of the freezer to have shortly (diet can wait) ronstar and Leolady56 - well done ladies, gold star for keeping up the group motivation and nice walks photos  I walked up the hill to the hospital and back down again (no photos - boring city centre). According to my Active 10 app I did 130 minutes walking today and 42 minutes were brisk - so not too shabby. And moomy you were right - my pulse was very high (walking and hospital anxiety) so they needed to take it again after 15 mins to check all okay.  Love to all maccie ramblers xxx",

This time eventually going for DIEP rather than permanent implant - but it does mean several more surgery trips. But there are many ladies on here who decided on the no reconstruction route - and very happy with it. And fortunately these days if you decide now not ti have a reconstruction immediately, your can usually leave it open if you change your mind later. Im wide awake at stupid o'clock due to a combination of millions of things on my mind and a night of hot flashes. Oh the joy of being a woman on this bleeping journey.    Not enough time to do much walking at the mo, but will walk from work up to the hospital later today (about 30 mins up hill) then back into town as have my pre-op assessment Good luck honey xxx",

Ive just had a couple of days away after my SNB on Monday.  It was lovely, but a little too much for me (booked before this poop arrived). Im feeling exhausted if Im honest. So planning a duvet morning with some internet shopping for my groceries etc.   Trying to avoid the garden as my grass needs cutting,  my OH is away, and I really must not do it!  Kathryn.b  totally understand your feeling of not wanting to socialise much. Glad you are getting out and walking. It is good (even just a little one) on so many levels.  When I had my first operation (WLE) it was the height of the Beast from the East in February and I was completely housebound as we had deep snow.  The sun makes such a difference to my emotions. There is a lovely thread called walking back to happiness where people post about their walking.  Good luck on 1 May.. Do let me know how it goes. Im thinking about a DIEP for my MX (next stage).  Millie2018 go glad your scar is healing well and you are liking you new boob.  I felt so happy after I had my first MX, I couldnt believe how good it looked.  Fingers crossed for your results.  @lucy-b (cant seem to tag you).  How are you doing?. Have you got a date for your results?  xxx",

Others have given you very sensible advice and support on how you are feeling and what might happen if it is cancer  I just wanted to come on and share my experience - my lump was a mix of a benign cyst and cancer cells at the tip. The cancer bit was only 10 mm. Dont think they ever told me what size the whole lump was and I have a lumpy breast so it was picked up in a routine mammogram, rather than me finding it.   As you will have gathered, there are lots of different cancers and they need the biopsy to determine the type, stage and grade. That then determines treatment plan.  My original treatment plan, given it was a small cancer and lower grade but invasive, was for a lumpectomy (usually called WLE) followed by radiotherapy.  And that would have been completed months ago.  My treatment has taken longer due to my history (see my profile) and my family history.  So I am having a mastectomy next.   Fingers crossed for you.  Only thing that will help deal with your anxiety is to try keep busy from now until your results appointment.  With a young baby, I cant image that will be too difficult much of the time.  Do try and take someone along with you to the  results appointment, if you can as most of us dont take much in when results are given.   Hugs , and do come back on and let us know what they say.

And that its very treatable.  My initial treatment plan was the same as yours. But as this is my second cancer (see my profile) they are going down a more radical treatment route for me.  My previous cancer was a large DCIS a long time ago, so different, not related.  May just be an unlucky coincidence, though I am exploring the genetics side as we have BC in my family. Im very happy to help in any way. Dont google, there is very little about it out there.  I have had WLE (lumpectomy) in Feb (clear margins)  and a Sentinel Node Biopsy on Monday (all clear).  So feeling positive.

Then a double DIEP reconstruction at a later point. it was going to be Nov/December for that part but things have been delayed for me so Im not sure when. I think you are having a similar double DIEP reconstruction, so I thought I'd say hello. To be honest, Im not sure what my breast will look like after Monday as I assume given this is an interim step the surgeon isn't going to spend hours perfecting it.   Hopefully the discomfort will pass, and good luck with your journey too xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Loudwoman  Someone might come along with more recent experience, but I had a nipple created for my first MX 17 years ago. It was a fairly simple procedure. They took some skin from my groin and created a nipple from that.  Dont remember any problems or pain.  After the wound had healed, it was then tattooed to give it a more realistic colour.  This all happened a year after my MX so that everything had settled.   On close inspection, its clearly different from the other side. But I have been really happy with it. It helped give me very rough symmetry of appearance. Not perfect but enough for me to feel that I was the same as all my other lady friends. Odd shaped (aren't we all) but good enough to help me deal with my emotional grief. I was 37 at the time, and how I looked was important to my sense of self.  Now I am about the face a double MX, and having reconstruction but won't bother about the nipples this time.  I did get a prosthetic nipple made.  Lovely work, but never felt right (chucked it out years ago) Suggest you ask the BCN if you can see some photos and more info on how they do it. Im sure the procedures have changed since I had it done Good luck with whatever you decided xxx",

She said the blood testing was very thorough and would take 2-3 months. It took 2 months, and she rang me to give me the results. The testing times and process may vary of course across the country and between NHS trusts. I totally understand that you find this delay worrying  - the implications play on your mind.   Good luck and thinking for you ",
