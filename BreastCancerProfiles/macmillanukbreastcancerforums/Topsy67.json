    "Content": "Hi I'm just newly diagnosed with breast cancer. It's a scary time. However now I'm told it looks like it's metastisised on the spine. So a bone scan is due this week. In bits here and I have no idea what to expect. I'm told if it has and they are sure it has then it's over to oncology and I won't have breast surgery but I will have drugs for it. The importance is now on the bone. I'm also reading there is no cure for Bone cancer. I am one very scared person right now.",
