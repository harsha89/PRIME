      "Content": "Hi everyone. I haven\u2019t been on here for some time but I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience to myself. My background - diagnosed with high grade DCIS six year ago. Had lumpectomy. No clear margin so was repeated  and had six weeks radiotherapy    All was fine until three years ago again diagnosed with high grade DCIS. Had Mastectomy and lymph node removal (was negative).  Am on yearly mammograms programme on my existing breast as I am on a 12 year trial connected to the radiotherapy. Just received a call from the Breast Clinic. I have been recalled for a second mammogram as they have found an 11mm area which looks suspicious  I go Saturday morning  .  Hopefully as I had a mammogram  only a year ago it will be something in the very early stages if anything at all.  Obviously I am very worried  I wondered if anyone had been through anything similar.  Many thanks Sazzie x",

I also had seroma which I had to have drained for about 8 weeks and it helped a lot with that too. May be mention it to your BCN. Good luck. I hope you don't have to suffer much longer x",

      "Content": "Hi Jane.  Like you I love swimming and am having a mastectomy on 29th February. I have bought a couple of swimsuits from a website called Amoena. They have a pocket that the prosthesis fits into it and while of course I haven't been able to try it yet it looks like it should be held quite well. I don't want a reconstruction so I am hoping it works for me  Good luck. Sazzieann xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Jane.  I am not new to Breast Surgery. I had Wide Local Excision surgery for DCIS in May 2013. Twice. Plus radiotherapy .Unfortunately I have recurrence that it is why it is now mastectomy. I am getting a bit nervous now that it is slowly approaching and suppose a bit apprehensive because I am also having Sentinel Node Biopsy which I didn't have last time so just a bit worrying that they think may have now turned invasive.  Anyway enough about me not sure fro. You post whether you have already had your op . Either way hope all goes well for you and I have just ordered the Knitted Knocker for aqua that Lynne suggested (thank you Lynne!). Also have just ordered another swimsuit from Amoena. They still have a sale on and have some swimsuits starting at £7 something + delivery.  Supposed to be 100% chlorine resistant too!!  Sazziann xx",
