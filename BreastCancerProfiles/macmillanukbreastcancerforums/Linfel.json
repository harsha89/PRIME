I did not realise until I was fitted with a prosthesis following mastectomy of my other breast earlier this year that I am entitled to a partial prosthesis for my remaining breast. Hope this helps.

      "Content": "Hi Penny Are you on antibiotics? I had a mastectomy a few weeks ago and intravenous antibiotics made me feel very nauseous. I also took tamoxifen for five years when I had my first encounter with bc and experienced lots of different side effects so it may be that this might be the cause. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Susan I have been taking Arimidex since March 2009 and the main side effects I am experiencing at the moment are hot flushes/night sweats and occasional aches and pains which are not preventing me carrying on as normal with the occasional help of ibuprofren and the occasional sleeping tablet to catch up on sleep. Also, because I had my ovaries removed 8 years ago I have been prescribed Fosimax to reduce risk of osteoporosis. Hope this helps. Best Wishes Linfel X",

      "Content": "Hi Julie I too was offered chemotherary as a precaution 10 years ago for stage 2 breast cancer that had not spread to my glands because I was premenopausal, although consultant said that I did not need it. I decided to opt for the lumpectomy plus radiotherapy and tamoxifen only and have not been troubled since although I now have BC in other breast which I am told is a completely separate cancer because of time lapse. Good luck Linfel",
