      "Content": "Hi guys - I'm new to this, but I am interested to read all of your comments and to see that you all seem to have the same concerns 😳. Having had a lumpectomy 16yrs ago, and then in May 2013 I discovered I had breast cancer in the other side, needing chemo, surgery and radio, I opted for a bi-lateral mastectomy which I had in October 2013. I have almost certainly decided to have the deip reconstruction, of which I have to wait for because of radio, so thinking October 2014, but haven't spoken to anyone who's actually been through it yet. I have been told it's fab 😀, a 10hr op with a weeks stay in hospital ... But I have also been advised no big driving for 3 mths - and no long distance (over 2hrs) or long haul flights for 6 mths. Because my job involves driving 2hrs + regularly I am wondering how others have found driving afterwards. I would just be interested to hear from people who have had the deip and how they got on with it please... Recovery, scarring, feeling, nipple tattooing etc. I am quite active, love swimming, kayaking and a bit of sailing and am hoping that I can freely carry on with these water sports soon afterwards with confidence in my new body 😉. Good luck to you all with what you are going through ATM. 😊xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you Helen, I'm Bournemouth area,I had a look at the keeping abreast group, it seems the nearest group is Bristol ( quite a distance!), but I did leave a message with the BCN so hopefully she'll get back to,me today, maybe she can put me in touch with a couple of people to speak to. I have researched other forms of reconstruction and feel they're not for me - loving the sound of deip, but just want to check results! Tracy - yep - wine is defo the way to go for a bit of fun and extra fat!! - like you I want to wear summer tops (I am going on holiday in a month for recovery before going back to work🌞😎🍷🌞!) and it's made me realise how low cut my normal summer tops are 😳!, swimming prothesis (of which I'm yet to get) all sounds so fiddly 😁. Thanks guys 😍 xx",
