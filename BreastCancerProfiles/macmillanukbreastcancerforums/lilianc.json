      "Content": "'Blisters'  after radio therapy i thought id share my story, i had a lumpectomy in 2001 then i had radiotherapy, my skin was badly affected and i was in a lot of pain and discomfort, but after the treatment it all cleared up and all was fine, BUT 5 years ago strange blisters and a rash appeared under my boob it was very itchy and painful,  it got infected and i was hospitalized 6 times in as many moths with 'Cellulitis' later called Lymphangitis, i was fine for a few years no more infections as i was put on permanent antibiotics to keep it at bay, but i got another infection before  Christmas last year and i was in hospital again, The Drs had no idea what i had and was visited by at least 4 different ones to see what they could do, intravenous antibiotics did the trick , the rash and 'blisters' are still there and i have to make sure i keep the area clean etc, But i asked to go back to a dermatologist and i did yesterday, she was lovely, and told me that what i have is a VERY rare condition,(the 'blisters' contained lymph Fluid and Blood) resulting from Radiotherapy, which is why i had so many different names as to what it was,  the Dr asked if i could be used as a case study, and i had photographs taken of the condition, so they could be used in medical journals, im pleased that there has been further decisions made to find out how my condition can be helped, so i will be going back to the Cancer hospital to see if there is a breast support they can give me to help . ill keep you informed of any further info if anyone is interested x",

      "Content": "Hi , thanks for the tip, but I have tried it,  my daughter bought me some, it helps for a little while,  but apparently my skin has lost, or is losing Collagen, so it can't repair itself, which is why the \"blisters\" are forming under\" pressure,\"x The dermatologist did give me the Latin name but I can't remember all she told me x  When I find out more I will share xx",
