      "Content": "Hi ladies, Asking for a bit of advice really. I had a lumpectomy 5 weeks ago and margins came back clear thankfully. I've been back at work and not lifting or doing things to put my scar at risk. I've noticed this week my breast has been a bit painful which is a but of a shock as had no problems post op. Under my arm to the side of my breast where your bra strap goes around your back is tender to touch as is underneath my breast. My lump was removed from above my nipple. Also where the scar is it feels very hard and tender to touch. Where the scar is I presume is healing tissue or scar tissue. My concern is the other tender areas. I don't know if this is normal or if anyone who has had a lumpectomy has any experience of this. I was thinking about ringing my BC nurse on Monday. I have an apt on Tues to see the onchologist to discuss radiotherapy as my dcis was high grade. I've been taking ibuprofen most of the week as it is painful, not really bad but enough to warrant a painkiller. I've checked that my bra isn't too tight or where it is tender the underwire  isn't sticking in but neither is the case. I've also bought a bigger size back strap to ensure it isn't too tight. Hasn't made any difference. I know things were clear but slightly worried. Hope this is all normal healing procedures. Many thanks Sam x",

I'm not sure if I've done this correctly but could I join you lovely ladies as I start my rt on Thurs 5th at The Christie. I've had a WLE on 31st Jan and thankfully came back with clear margins. Was offered rt as was high grade DCiS. I start on 5th for 15 zaps.  Not really sure how I feel at the moment. I know I have made the right choice. I feel I need to try everything to hopefully with everything crossed I can help stop any reoccurrence. Keep telling everyone it will all be fine and I'm fine but had a bit of a wobble whilst in the shower this morning. I know I'm very very lucky and count my blessings everyday. Just wondering if it's normal? Sending much love to everyone Sam x",

Enjoy the weekend. Just said to hubby my boob feels a bit hot. Put some aloe very gel on it but think it feels hot inside if that makes sense. Might do one and go and read my book as he has the golf on. I usually like the big majors but not until the last day which is Sunday. The build up before the cut is like watching paint dry lol.

First apt took longer as the double/triple check it is in the right place. You cannot feel anything. I didn't have a head/ chin strap. I had to lie on the bed and rest my right arm in support and head rested in head support. Perhaps that was just for the measuring apt although I didn't have it done then either? Please try not to worry. Just try and stay relaxed and think happy thoughts. It really is over before you can blink. Hope this helps x I bought some aloe vera gel from the health shop and on advice put it in the fridge. Lovely and cooling. My boob so far is OK and not changes colour or sore but only had 2 zaps. Hoping it continues. This week is the test as got the full 5/zaps. On Hols from school this week so resting up. Due to go back next week after easter hols but will see how I feel. I have an hour and 15 min journey there and the same back to hospital for apt. My head is brilliant and told me to see how I feel.  Sending love and hugs Sam xx",

Queenfisher the only thing I've used is aloe vera gel from Holland and Barratt. Very gentle as 99.7% just aloe vera. Even better when put in the fridge as suggested by the lovely Leolady. Touch wood only slight tanning so far. Might be worth a try. I'm on the last bit now had 10/15 so only 5 left to ringing the bell.  Love and hugs to everyone Sam xx",

With my experience everything seems to be 2 weeks between apts. I went back to work the day after my all clear but was lucky as I only had to work 2 days then the third day was an inset (I work in a school) then it was half term for a week. This is the first week  of 2 week Easter hols so again lucky I will get 1 and half weeks of treatment in the Hols. Planning to work morninings if I feel OK as I have asked to have apts in the afternoon. Hoping I'm not too tired as I have to go to The Christie in Manchester which is an hour and 15 there and back! Feeling a bit anxious but sure it will all be fine. I will feel better after I've been today and know what its like.  Sending lots of love to everyone.  Love Sam xx",

      "Content": "Hi katiepie, I'm a full time TA but also cover classes. I've been very lucky as had lumpectomy 31st Jan. Had 2 weeks off post op. Given all clear from high grade DCiS but offered radiotherapy due to high grade. Thankfully no chemo required.  I went back to work Wed/Thurs all day then Fri was inset. Followed by Feb half term. Back full time after Hols then started rt. I had 7/15 during Easter Hols. Back Mon morning then left for rt. Very busy traffic and lots of road closures this week! I'm working till almost lunchtime 11.30 but have to leave due to long journey to hospital. Had 9/15 today but must admit starting  to feel tired already. Maybe combination or rt/journey and going back to work. I've also been very well supported by school. Everyone has been amazing and looking after me. I'm also not going to be silly and if it gets too much I will take some time off but fingers crossed I can do this. Hope this helps and you get well supported as I'm sure you will. Love and hugs Sam xx",

      "Content": "Morning DohaYogi, I have used simple roll on deodorant. No one at any stage has told me not to wear it. I read in the booklet the hospital game me not to wear any deodorant containing aluminium. Think most sprays contain it. Have a great day everyone. Going for 10/15 later today so 2/3rd the way through now. Not looking forward to journey today ad lots of major roads to hospital close today. 2 for 3 months and 1 for 3 days. All part of the fun for me to find alternative route that won't hopefully impact on the already 1 and 15 journey! Hay ho setting off a bit earlier to be on the safe side and just hope the traffic won't be too much of a nightmare. Love and hugs to all Sam xx",

I fear I'm going to be an emotional wreck. I feel really tired tonight but think its my emotions building. Heard lots of ladies talking about how they feel at the end. I've pushed through this working and travelling and don't want to let myself down by crying tomorrow. Plus my mum is taking me and I don't want to cry in front of her as I've said all along I'm fine, which I feel I have been. Bl##dy hate this feeling. I am such a strong personality and feel I've lost my confidence. Sorry feeling  a bit woe is me. I was given some hydrocortisone cream today as my nipple is driving me mad itching. Only started last night.  Good luck with the zaps. Love and hugs  Sam xx",

I must admit I was a bit emotional this morning before I went and when I rang the bell I had glistening eyes but held it together! I've had a glass of bubbles to celebrate but going to celebrate on Saturday as its my youngest daughters 14th birthday. I would like to thank you all for your support and I will be logging in daily to see how everyone is doing as well as being on the main BC forum. I wish you all well on your journey and cheers to you all. I wanted to add a photo but don't know how? Anyone know how to do it? Love and hugs Sam xxxxxxxx",

You said that your margines came back clear but what is the oncotype DX breast reaccurrance test you have to wait for. No one has said anything about this to me? I have no idea what all these initials and types are? Anyway keeping everything crossed for you too. Hope you enjoyed your wine. Definitely deserve it.  Lots of love Sam xxx ",
