      "Content": "Everybody's journey is so different.  I felt very alone at different stages throughout my operations, chemo and radiation but you have to find a way of coping.  I kept telling myself that I'm on an escalator that I can't step off until I've finished my journey, one step after another! I've also just had to put my 6 month old puppy to sleep due to medical issues .... I thought life couldn't get any crappier...... until it does!",

      "Content": "Looking for a bit of advice...... I'm 13 months down the road after having two lumpectomy operations on my breast, 6 bouts of chemo and 5 weeks of radiation.  Is it normal for your breast to be still tender to touch and the feeling of heaviness?? This is my 3rd post ever as I'm one to bottle things inwardly rather than sharing..... I've decided that's not really healthy!  I enjoy reading your posts about the different journeys everyone is going through, I still get days when I feel really down (more since losing my puppy who gave me a purpose).... I feel I've lost my \"spark\"in life.  I finish my last herceptin medication tomorrow which has been every 3 weeks (for just over 12 months) going back to the chemo ward so I'm hoping after being diagnosed in September 2015 I can now truly try to move forward as all I need to take now is hormone tablets for the next 4 years......otherwise it's been Oncologist appointments, echocardiograms, doctor visits.....  Time to try and \"get my life\" back ..... x ",
