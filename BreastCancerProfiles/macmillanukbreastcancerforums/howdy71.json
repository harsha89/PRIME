      "Content": "Hi, I am having a horrible few days and cannot get all the what ifs out of my head.  I was diagnosed in March grade 3 2/12 lymph nodes affected.  I had my lumpectomy in April and now waiting for my first chemo course on the 28th May. On the whole I feel positive, but on days like today I cannot stop worrying, this is followed by no sleep and aches and pains which I automatically think are new symptoms!!!  My rational head tells me to pack it in, its not helping - but that negative part of me lets my imagination run wild. Any tips on how to stay positive?",

      "Content": "Well I am very near the end of my treatment and to celebrate I am going to Cumbria and up Scafell Pike  this weekend with all of my walking buddies! In 2014 at 42 I had lumpectomy, chemo (Fec-T), radiotherapy and have 2 of 18 herceptin left. As I was going through treatment I would not have believed I would be able to do this, but kept walking as much as I could last year. So for all you lovely people still on the treatment journey - keep going and look forward because you can get your old self back! Just give yourself a break during treatment and don't push yourself too far too soon. Good luck everyone! Jen x",

      "Content": "Hi all, My worst fear with chemo was losing my hair.  I had my first FEC on the 28th May and in the last couple of days my head started hurting and a few strands of hair came out every time I put my fingers through it.  I decided to take control and had already got some scarves and a little fake fringe so I cut it all off!!! I can't tell you how relieved I felt!!  Then today I went out for lunch, in the shops and even faced all the lovely mums on the school run with my new look.  After all the worrying about how others would react, all I got was lots of compliments and support. My kids are already used to it too, they don't care if I have hair or not - I am still mum. I just wanted to share my experience with you because I wish I had not wasted time worrying about it and I am so glad I just faced up to it.  So far I have spent my time worrying about all the things that could happen in this process, but from now on am determined to take each day  as it comes. Round two of FEC next week - bring it on!! Jen xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lizane I had to reply to you as I went through a similar experience.  During chemo I experienced back pain and after an MRI was told they were 99% sure I had bone mets in my spine. I was told by oncologist, registrar and bcn that they were certain of the diagnosis.  Whilst trying to cope with chemo anyway the stress of the news was horrible.  I felt that way I was informed and the lack of any follow up as to how I was coping was not good enough.  I had another MRI three months later and was told that it was not secondary cancer but heamangioma in the bone which is completely harmless. The relief was amazing!! - but then the anger set in as to how they could leave me for nearly four months thinking I had secondaries. I am a few months on now and have chosen not to be angry but be happy that they did what they thought was right with what they thought the diagnosis was - they had changed my medication and were doing what they thought was best for me. I now feel like I have been given a second chance and I am going to make the most of it. Take care Jen xx",
