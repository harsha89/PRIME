      "Content": "Hi. Can anyone out there help me. I have secondary breast cancer in my liver (5 tumours) my ribs and spine. I saw my oncologist yesterday and left in tears , again . I was being scanned every 3 to 4 months but now she's leaving me 10 months till she even requests another scan. She's ignoring my new symptoms such as swollen feet and hands, pin's and needles, difficulty breathing and severe joint pain. I was given codeine and told the only other thing she can do is give me morphine. I feel like I've been written off . Sadly her bed side manner is non existent. Her final words were you're doing ok but your heads in a mess . I feel like i have been abandoned and ignored . Is it normal at this stage to be left without a scan or appointment for this long ? I feel very alone .",

      "Content": "Thank you. I'm currently on exemestane and denusumab injections 4 x weekly but I am not currently getting any chemo etc . I've not been referred to a liver specialist because she said they can't do anything because I have 5 tumours . The problem is I was missed diagnosed in the first place in 2007 . I was told I was hormonal .5 months later I kept going back and they found 5 breast tumours and that it had spread in my lymph nodes. I had a double mastectomy. 3 1/2 years ago I felt really unwell. My GP ignored me and eventually (18 months later) they scanned me and found my secondary cancer . I've had a second round of chemo but now I feel pushed out again. I'm just not feeling secure about my treatment . I have a lot to  live for and I really want taking seriously. I'm not ready to give in yet . I really appreciate your help.it feels good knowing there are others out there xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you . I will go and see my gp . I've had one mess after another . To top it all I had horrendous dentistry 6 months ago that should not have happened because I am on denusumab. I still have an open wound that won't heal . I'm waiting for a hospital referral to sort that as they think I may have osteonecrosis of the jaw now. I'm a positive person but I'm struggling right now . Thank you for all your ideas . X",

I could brush her manner off before but now I can't . I dread appointments with her because she is so awful . It just shouldn't be like that xxx ",
