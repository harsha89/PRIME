      "Content": "Hi Fiona, (and all)  Again, your post resonates .... I'm 3 weeks post last chemo, start radio on weds 18th which is about 7 months after diagnosis, and have been counting down the days to this point only to find I feel horrendous !!!! Last T seemed to hit me for six, and after 3 weeks I feel absolutely knackered, find if I walk my dogs a mile I come home and feel totally wiped out, which frustrates and angers me. Had my Hickman line out last thurs, but still have a dressing on that will be removed following first radio, but I'm dreading it. I did ask my gp for the R1 and R2 creams, but the pharmacist called today saying they've refused to prescribe them as not requested by my oncologist. Grrrr !!!!  As well as feeling as though I haven't bounced back very well I've also put on about 10lb during chemo from eating anything I fancied, and being inert, whereas I usually eat ok-ish but am very busy. Emotionally I feel a bit wonky too....I've had a pain that comes and goes behind a knee for the whole time since surgery in Nov, which has been dismissed as a trapped nerve as bone scans in nov were clear, but after reading posts in secondary breast cancer forum where someone had the same dismissal from doctors and ended up with secondaries and a 10cm tumour I have sent myself into a spin. I've called my breast nurse this am and am waiting for a call to discuss my original scans. As far as I'm aware there are no scans planned for me, and it's straight onto Letrozole, which, again, I'm dreading.... I just don't feel like me anymore, and am struggling - perhaps naively, I thought as soon as chemo was done I'd chirp up !!!!",

      "Content": "Hi all I'm in the same position - start radio on 18th May but when I queried these creams with my oncologist they were dismissed in favour if the Epaderm I've been using since surgery in Nov.  With all the positives I've read I'm considering ordering them and going ahead, but am loathe to do so against advice of my team ........I have 15 sessions over 3 weeks due. ",

      "Content": "Morning  Just wanted to say that I'm opposite !!! I'm grade 3 ER+ and have had a mastectomy and full node clearance, and was initially hysterical as I'm NOT Her2+.  That may sound bizarre, but prior to my results my surgeon referred constantly to herceptin   being hailed to as a wonder drug, and of the 2 people I know who have been through breast cancer both were her2+ .......in my mind the option of no herceptin was less treatment, and upset me greatly.  Thankfully the lovely people on here have made many explanations to me and I feel slightly calmer about it all, considering the hormone therapies etc available to me ....",
