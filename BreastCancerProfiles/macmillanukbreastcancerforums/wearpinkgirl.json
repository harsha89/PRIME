      "Content": "8383susie Hi all I had my chemo 2 years ago and I finished my Herceptin 1 year ago. whenever I have had a blood test at the hospital I have always been told they cannot use the arm where my lymph nodes were removed. Today I had to go for a blood test at my GPs and as usually she had great trouble finding a vein. She asked my why we couldnt use my other arm and I explained it to her. She then said that after a certain amount of time the arm can be used again???? Has anyone else been told this because at the hospital they are adament the arm shouldnt be used and my friend who had gone 9 years after treatment still never used her surgery arm. I didnt let her use it and eventually she got enough blood.Why would it become different and not matter if its used , nothing would have changed the nodes are still not there no matter how many years pass.   Your thoughts please.   Sue   Sue  I had a dreadful Experience yesterday at for similar reasons . Having had lymph clearance in both sides and using Fragmin Post blood clot , Ive had my bloods and blood presume taken from my foot . The blood deptmenent ( at a top London hospital )refused to do this procedure and its was an emergency request , got a senior male nurse who agrued with me and said they'd been a meeting that day and bloods no longer taken . I was distraught . I requested to speak to someone senior saying they may have changed what they want to do but my body and the reasons it can't be done haven't . In the end the bloods were taken and will be from now from My portavus fitting . I could not allow this nurse to do the procedure I asked for an escort who did the procedure . I was distraught on top of a long ,difficult day . So to read your letter was amazing . When and who had changed this procedure ? Good luck and stay positive when you can and allow the tough stuff to process . We can be sad it doesn't mean we are negative or not copping . ☀️☀️",

      "Content": "puzzler well done for standing up for yourself .....it can be difficult ! it was really difficult as it was a male nurse as well and I didn't want to seem odd. But after having a cross discussion I felt it was totally wrong for him to do a procedure on me . I not understand how it can just be changed !! I hope you are ok and are managing in this hot melting weather ., which I love but in my home with the curtains closed. Definitely feeling the heat more since lymph ops??",
