      "Content": "Thanks for replying Gail, We saw the consultant yesterday. It turns out many of the nurses will off sick so they were unable to allocate us appointment. I'm guess it's due to the rather severe flu season we are having at the moment. Thankfully they managed to sort one out for us at same time we see the anesthesiologist.",

      "Content": "I was with my mother for the initial consultation at UCLH for her breast cancer diagnosis. We were told that we would later see a breast cancer nurse to go over some post operative photos with her. Unfortunately, her assigned nurse was not available in the afternoon, so were were not able to have that appointment. We have tried contacting UCLH, but we have not received a new appointment with the nurse. How important is this appointment?",
