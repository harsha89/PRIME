Im 23 and recently felt a lump on my left brest went to see my GP yesterday and after a quick examaniation he has arranged an urgent breast clinic appointment and alreaddy have the date for less then 2 weeks away. I could only feel one lump but my GP said he could feel a few which now has me really concerned. I have a parternal aunt  who suffered fron breast cancer but no other family history .  I just dont know what to expect at the appointment. How long it will take or if i should bring my partner with me or what is actually involved.  Thank you in advance ",

Its just not like me to be worried  or anxious about something so it hit me a bit out of nowhere but im hopefully anxious over nothing and it will be fine.  Thanks again for your response ",
