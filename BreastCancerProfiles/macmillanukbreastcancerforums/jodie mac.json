      "Content": "Until today i was quite calm.. knew the diagnosis and knew all that would really help was the mastectomy and whatever treatment that followed.. it seemed sensible and natural to just get on with it and get it over with.. now tho Im panicy and  upset..i guess ive just realised that after tomorow ill have only one breast and im so so scared ... I dont know yet what follow up treatment ill have but the thought of possibly long  term having to worry about whether im going to have chemo or radiotherapy and what that might mean has got me terrified.. shit its NOT fair !",
