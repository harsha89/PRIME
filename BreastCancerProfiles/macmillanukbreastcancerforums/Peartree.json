      "Content": "I had my last FEC-T chemo mid April and finished radio mid July. I'm triple negative so don't have any ongoing drugs. My issue is continuous, debilitating joint pain. Everything hurts - all of my joints ache all of the time, my hands and feet are probably the worst affected areas but everything from my neck downwards hurts. During chemo I did have very bad hand/foot syndrome as an allergic reaction to doxetaxol so maybe that's not helped. In the mornings I can hardly walk, it gets a little better once I start moving but not that much. I walk my dog for an hour or so a day, not very quickly I may add, but it doesn't seem to help - afterwards I feel shattered. After sitting for even a short while I struggle to get up. At night I can't get comfortable and have trouble sleeping. If I have a day where I try to do lots of things or have a day out shopping with friends or something I always pay for it the next day with even more aches.  At my last follow up with the oncologist he said it's all because the chemo put me through the menopause and my sudden lack of oestrogen is causing the pain. He likened it to suddenly losing all the lubrication in my joints. There wasn't anything he suggested to help and hoped it would improve over time. I've turned 50 this year but now feel like a 90 year old. I'm hoping that some of you may have had similar experiences and may have words of wisdom.        ",

      "Content": "Hi Flopsyuk, Thanks for your response. I'm sorry to hear you've got ongoing problems too.  The pain I had during chemo with the Filgrastim injections was different to what I have now - more intense and mainly concentrated in my hips and legs, it was constant and not affected by moving around. Now it's less intense, more of a throbbing and is much worse when I try to move. My hands hurt all the time and are slightly swollen. The swelling makes me there's more too it and I'm thinking of trying lymphatic drainage massage to see if it'll help. I definitely have some peripheral neuropathy so maybe my hands and feet are especially bad because of that. I'll definitely take a look at the supplements you mentioned. Sorry to hear some of your symptoms are getting worse - losing toe nails isn't pleasant. I only lost mine a few weeks ago and my last chemo was April - it just goes to show how different we all are I suppose.      I think it's time to speak to my BCN and see if there are any tests I can have.   I hope the rest of your treatment and recovery goes well and you're back on your feet before too long.  X  ",

The thought of this going on for 2 years is scary and not what I want to hear. I need to find out what's causing the pain, if that's possible, and then hopefully what may relieve it. It's all a bit much when we've still got the worry of recurrence as well.  Oh well, time to try and get comfortable in bed again. X",

I've lost 11 of my nails - all fingers and one toe although I think the other toes may go too. I'm ok with all that because I expected it, sort of. I'm so tired I could sleep all the time but of course I can't as life goes on (and everyone thinks I'm fine now and so just being lazy), I expected that too. But I really wasn't expecting my body to feel so different, so I 'old'. Like you I'm impatient! Hi Susie, Thank you for your experience - it's good to know that this achy feeling may not be permanent. I will ask for some tests to see if I'm lacking in anything and to see if it is arthritis. But either way it looks like it's a long haul back to 'normal', or should I say the ''new normal', whatever that is. ",

I do plan to exercise more, probably swimming, once my radiation burns have healed, they're current still so sore and I can't chance an infection.  I didn't put on any weight during treatment but I could do with losing a stone.

Mammogram in December was clear. My breast has hardening from scar tissue but the area of the ribs near my breast are very tender and my nipple has pins and needles like sensations. Is this likely to still be residual stuff from the treatment? (I had a circum-areola WLE and my breast is still hotter than the other from the radio too). Logic tells me a clear mammo just a few months ago means it's nothing but part of me is terrified it's back. Anyone experienced similar symptoms over a long recovery period?",

      "Content": "Hi Sinead,  Ive just posted this as a reply to the hair loss thread on the under 50's group. It's my experience of losing my hair: So sorry you've joined the club no one wants to be in. I was diagnosed in December, have had surgery and part way through chemo. I have lost my hair. Being totally honest it hasn't been the worst thing although I thought it would be absolutely devastating. I decided not to do the cold cap as the oncologist said my chemo cocktail: FEC-T was a hair loss one. He was right - exactly 2 weeks after my first chemo it started coming out which was awful and I did shed a few tears but the next day I asked my hairdresser to shave it all off - it was a relief. If losing my hair was part of beating this thing I could do it. I now have a selection of beanies and wooly hats (I bought a couple of the typical chemo turbans but hated those) and a couple of wigs. It's ok, in fact I really like how my wigs look - they're nothing like my hair was but it's not my hair so I decided to have some fun with my wigs - I have a short bob one and a longer layered one. Why not?! As far as your little one is concerned they are very resilient. My little boy is 7. I told him that I needed to have some strong medicine to make me better but that it would make mummy's hair fail out. When I had it shaved he thought it looked funny and loved to pull my hats off to show my egg head to everyone (I was initially mortified at this but have got used to it now. Everyone who has unexpectedly seem me bald has been lovely about it). He has tried on my wigs and we've had a laugh about them too. He is now completely unfazed whether I'm at home bald, with a beanie on or out and about in a wig.  That's just my experience of losing my hair. I wish I hadn't lost it but it will grow back eventually and when it does it will be part of moving on from this. Testament to me kicking cancer's butt!! It may or may not help ",

      "Content": "In the big scheme of things this may seem a stupid thing to do but I want to delay my radiotherapy by a few weeks in order to enjoy a holiday that was booked last year before my diagnosis. I turned 50 a couple of weeks ago. Last summer I booked a villa in Turkey and invited some special girlfriends to join me for a week to celebrate my half century. A once in a lifetime sort of thing. When I found out I had cancer it was one of the first things I said to my oncologist - I wanted to go, it was important to me and he was on board with it. The holiday starts on the 5th June. I'm due to have my last (6th) chemo next week. My oncologist had said I would have my radiotherapy planning session before the holiday and start the therapy once I got back. I'm due to have 20 days of radio. However, when I saw him last Friday he now wants me to squeeze the radiotherapy in before my holiday - which will be very tight timewise (radiotherapy will have to start about a week after chemo and will finish just a few days before I go) and will mean that I'll still be 'cooking'. He's also said I won't be able to sit in the sun (I'm very careful with sunscreen, always SPF30+, but still love to feel the sun on my skin). I won't be able to swim either if I have any skin issues from the radio which being larger busted is highly likely, especially in the mammary fold area). He said that the radiotherapy will be more effective closer to chemo and that I shouldn't delay. I felt a bit pressured so I agreed. I'm now having second thoughts though. I want to enjoy my holiday - I want to soak up a little sun and swim. I don't want to be worrying about radiation burns and infections.  Does anyone know if a short delay, of a few weeks, to the start of radiotherapy could have detrimental effect? I know this all seems silly, it is just a holiday, but it's all been about the cancer for the past 5 months. I just want a little break!!",

Unless there's a cast iron reason not to I'm going to delay radiotherapy. If I can start on the Monday after I come back from holiday it will be 7.5 weeks from the date of my last chemo.

I can't just delay it all, it just won't happen if I do. Some of my friends have only been able to take the time out of their own lives to come because of my cancer: it's their way of supporting me and that's a big thing: two of them also have disabled kids and I know how tough it can be to get away.

      "Content": "Thanks Julia, I don't quite get the sudden sense of urgency and U-turn that's been taken. I definitely need to speak to my consultant. Originally my surgeon wanted me to have chemo before surgery but I insisted that the surgery be done first (I could feel my cancer 'tingling' which is why I found it. I couldn't cope with it being there any longer). It was removed with clear margins and the lymph nodes were negative for cancer. I was declared \"cancer free\". I am scared of it coming back and what it could mean so I have talked to my oncologist about trials but I don't qualify for the only relevant one (Olympia) as i came back negative for BRCA genes. I have a little boy who's disabled and the first thing I ever said to my oncologist was that he will always need his mum so losing this fight is not a option for me. I've read everything and done so much research and I've always got a raft of difficult questions for him ('ve probably not been the easiest patient!) so maybe he's just trying to give me the very best shot at it.  As far as the holiday goes I booked the villa and some flights long before I was diagnosed. But following my diagnosis friends who had said they couldn't come have pulled out all the stops to make it happen and that means so much. There is some research that says that concurrent chemo and radio improves the effectiveness of the treatments but I can't find that much on timescales between the treatments and any impact.",

Although sore and very, very bruised (my excision is around my nipple and the surgeon accessed everything from there) the pain had started to ease and I was managing on just a few paracetamol a day. I saw the surgeon Wednesday and he removed the dressing and said it was healing well.  Yesterday I had lots of stuff that needed to be done and so I drove the car for the first time (about 50 miles), went to an appointment, had lunch did a little shopping and then cooked dinner in the evening. By bedtime I was hurting a lot. This morning the pain was back with a vengeance. Sharp, searing pain in my armpit and side of my breast when I move as well as the constant post-surgery, lower level pain again. I've been back on the codeine tablets today and have been taking it easy. Do you think I've just overdone it and aggravated everything? Anyone had anything similar post surgery? My skin in the entire area is very sensitive but there isn't any marked redness or hot spots.  I'm inclined to give it the rest of the weekend and if it hasn't calmed down ring the hospital on Monday",

      "Content": "Oh, I'm with you ladies. Talk about supermarket meltdown I had supermarket sit-down! - 6 days after chemo decided I'd do a little food shopping. I just about managed to get through the checkout and then had to sit on the chairs. I felt like a little old lady, sitting there getting my breath back!! I could so have burst into tears right there and then. For goodness sake, I'm youngish, healthy, nothing normally phases me but there I was gulping water and feeling exhausted to my very core. I've only been on this road 7 weeks and cannot believe how hard it is. The emotional fall-out is huge - family and friends are being so caring and are generally managing to say the right things but in my head a hurricane of emotion is whirling away night and day. I've done some crying and I'm sure I'll do some more but for now I'm thankful for finding this forum and for knowing that this is normal for us for now. ",

      "Content": "Hi lizPY, I too was diagnosed with TNBC in November, had surgery early Decmber and now waiting to start chemo on 6th Jan. 6 cycles of FEC-T. I've thought about my hair and am planning to get it clippered off 10 days or so after my first chemo. I don't think I can bear to have huge handfuls come out in the shower or wake up with it in my mouth if it's all over the pillow!! I've bought a few hats and scarves which I can't say I'm enamoured with so I'm going to look at wigs with a friend on Wednesday. My hair, although in a bob and so shortish, is one of my 'things' - I often get strangers asking me where I get it cut, so losing it is going to be hard. But, if I'm going to get rid of the cancer it's got to go, it's a done deal! See you on the January chemo thread and we will get through this - hair or no hair!! X",

I had an immediate mammogram and have an ultrasound on 22nd Dec. So unlikely to get any results until after the holidays. Like you we've hard a tough year - not only my cancer but other stuff too. Our 'luck pot' certainly seems to be empty. I was hoping the New year was going to a symbolic change and we could embrace 2017 with renewed hope. Seems we'll have to delay a bit.",

      "Content": "Just to go back to the subject of PICC lines - I've had mine 9 days now. It really wasn't bad having it put in and having chemo through it was fine.  I've had a few little problems - some bleeding around the entrance of the tube but only a little. I do tend to bruise easily but the area around the line and the attachment of the plastic butterfly is badly bruised, small very defined bruising the colour of deep red wine - this is very tender and I can't take any pressure on the area (so getting comfy to sleep is sometimes tricky). The line was flushed and dressed today so it's all looking ok I'm just hopeful that it 'heals' a bit over the coming weeks. But, I'd still rather have my PICC than chemo damaging my veins and leaking into my tissues.  It's day 7 after chemo for me. Still struggling with a bit of nausea - actually a strange difficulty in swallowing, not physically, just being able to get the food down. Feeling pretty tired and washed out and the inside of my mouth is starting to change - my gums and cheek linings are becoming rough and insensitive. I've also got a lovely spot on my nose although I'm not sure that's the chemo!!!",

I had an immediate mammogram and was given an appointment for an ultrasound scan next week.......all I can think is that this is the same rollercoaster again.  We're having a NYE party because it's been a tough year in many respects and we were looking forward to 2017. Now this is hanging over us and probably will be for the next few weeks until we have results - all over the holidays. Scared is an understatement of how I'm feeling right now. ",

      "Content": "Hi J, At last your taking the next step but you're bound to be nervous. I had my surgery in December - just a lumpectomy so not as major as yours but it was ok. The anaesthetic was ok, it really does feel like you just go to sleep. When I woke up afterwards the pain was manageable as you're given local anaesthetic as well to ease the immediate post op. pain and then regular painkillers after it starts to wear off. I did feel quite sick but that passed quickly. I basically just slept for the rest of the day and quite a bit of the following few days - it does take it out of you.  As far as what it will look like don't worry too much about that post op. Mine looked awful and I was black and blue for days. I had a circum-areola scar with so many black stitches that I called it my 'Franken-nipple' - it looked so bad! But it's healed now to a pink line and the bumpy, lumpy post surgery boob has started to take on a smoother shape. All in all the shape is now better than my other boob!!! I hope all that will allay your fears a little bit. It'll be ok. Very best of luck for Thursday, we'll be thinking of you",
