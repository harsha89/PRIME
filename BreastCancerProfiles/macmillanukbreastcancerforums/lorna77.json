I totally know what you mean about the waiting, a real pain!!! Still not sure about the cold cap, but can honestly say losing me hair on me head isn't a worry its me eye brows. Silly really as my partner says you can't really see them anyway!  Hope you hear from the hospial soon and good luck with the cold cap  xx",

      "Content": "Hey Alison Worst birthday present ever!!!! Glad to hear the lymph node was clear though, that was my biggest worry. And i have a good friend at work who had breast cancer about 18 months ago, she's middle 40's. Seeing her go through it has made it a lot easier for me, really nice to speak with someone who gets all my moans and groans :0). She didn't have chemo though just radio and tomixifen. So we'll be sharing hot flushes at least!! I wasn't to worried about the chemo untill last week, when i got my date to start (24th,next week!!) I think the reality of it all is really starting to sink in!! I've already had my hair cut short in preperation.  I'm in Northolt Middx, so if your inside the M25 you can't be that far from me. I've just signed up for a breast cancer forum in London on the 1st and 2nd of july. Its for young women. You might want to take a look, it looks really great and they put you up in a hotel for the night and it's all free :0). I came across it on the breast cancer care web site. Hope you get good results Friday, let me know how it goes. Lorna x",

And unfortunatly i'm no where near Birmingham way, i'm more London, it would be quite a trek!!! :0) Shame as i've tried looking and there are support groups local but none for younger women. I don't mind to much about meeting people of similar age as this site already has been of great support for me. But nice to know there are more of you like me on here to share some of the issues i might face. (i think i may of worded that all wrong, i made it sound like i'm some sort of different spieces from another planet!!! lol.) xx",

I even said to my breast care nurse the other day is it normal that i haven't fallen to pieces yet!!! Bless her, her responce to me was i think your amazing, I'll take that as not normal!! If i'm honest i have had a few moments but only because i worry about the affect it has on my family.  Staying positive and humour is most definatly the way forward with cancer and life in general.
