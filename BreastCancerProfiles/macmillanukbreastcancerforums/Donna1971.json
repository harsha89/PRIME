One minute i,m happy the next i am a blubbering mess.Want to scream the loudest yesss i did it !! then want to crawl under my covers.  Will and determination and a great family and friend support got me through and of course Macmillan. Now what.... well i intend to live life to the fullest, i know i have a ways to go on the recovery and the lovely  tamoxifen , which only side effect i have is the sweats.  I put a little blog on here about my experiences, if anyone would like to leave hints or tips for those still fighting the fight and winning or any questions about fec/t or mastectomy etc .  Lots of love and strength to you all Donna xxx",

You will feel all those but you will get through it. I remember on my 5th session on FEC/T i was inconsolable, yelling and allsorts, i went into my oncologist and said why is this happening so bad now after 5 treatments, she said it was normal everyone seems to breakdown at the same point. the next day i was totally fine, letting it all out is a release, talking about it is a stress reliever aswell.  I did find if i new what was coming i could prepare myself for example i new i was getting a bad cold i could feel it i went to my dr and he gave me anti biotics and a blood test and sure enough i had an infection, i caught it before it progressed. I also took sickness tablets before each session not after. Have a look at the blog i wrote on here about hints and tips , cerain things can help ease. It is tough going i wont lie but you will get through it, then afterwards like me its like when you had a baby and after he or she is born you say to your self omg did i really just go through that i know what i went through i just cant remember feeling it !!  Be strong you will do just fine, listen to the doctors and most of all your own body  Is it FEC/T you are starting ?

I keep everything crossed for you on your wanting to be a mum. Stay strong you will get through it stay determined, it will be hard some days, do as your body tells you that is the best advice, if your worried about anything you pick up the phone to your Mac nurse or Dr that's what they are there for. When I started I never wanted to call I didn't want to bother them as they are busy but I learned quickly too call if I needed too.  All the best for Thursday ...onwards and upwards go kick its ass !!!
