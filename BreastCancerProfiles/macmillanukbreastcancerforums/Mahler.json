      "Content": "At the end of November I reported a breast lump to my doctor, she faxed the hospital, I got a phone call from them that afternoon and was told to report in two days later. After blood tests, MRI, biopsy, bone scan, nuclear scan, stomach and kidney scan,mammogram, I was operated on on 1st December 2008. I was told it was a grade 2 cancer and that it was all removed and had not spread to the lymph nodes. I was also told that I would probably have two weeks of radiotherapy or tablets. Yesterday I was told that I was to have four weeks of radiotherapy and tablets for 5 years. Ten days after the operation I was rushed into hospital with chest pains and after an angiogram and nuclear scan it was found I have a blocked artery and angina, which at the moment is being treated with medication. All this has happened within three weeks and has left me reeling. My brain is a mushy mess. I have escaped the attention of hospitals for 74 years but now feel they have got their claws into me! I have been told that the radiation makes you feel very sleepy afterwards, how sleepy is very sleepy, how do I cope as I live on my own. How does one feel after? I also have to have transport provided as I will have to go to Charing Cross hospital, that probably means I will be at the hospital all day waiting for transport . I am so weepy, and even have the thoughts of declining the treatment. I don't know what to do. I gave up smoking a month ago but after my appointment yesterday I came home and started smoking again, foolish I know but I am not coping. I feel that I need someone to give me a good shake, I am into a world that I know nothing about.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your comments and good wishes. Renee, you mentioned tattooing prior to surgery, I had a horrendous session where they put wires through the lump, so painful, then a mammogram after that, that really waas painful. Cancer is something I know so little about, I cannot recall anyone in my family having it. I just hope that I have not started something. I do have family around me and have always had someone with me when attending hospital, but for the radiotherapy I will be on my own, my daughter is a night nurse and cannot possibly take any more time off work, the rest of my family are in the same boat, they have taken so much time off so far. Even though I have had family around me supporting me, I have had the perculiar feeling of being lonely, as though I am apart from everyone, almost as if no one really understands how I feel because they have not experienced what I am feeling,. Then add to this that I am the biggest coward in the world! I am impressed by the bravery of everyone that is on this site and wish you all a speedy return to good health.",
