I had my results only today and so just trying to process it all. I will also have radiotherapy and this was a reason given by the consultant as to why I might consider it....very grateful to you for your response, thank you!",

      "Content": "i have just been diagnosed today and thankfully realise I am one of the lucky ones to have such a treatable cancer! However, I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019d like a breast reduction at the same time as my tumour is removed as my breasts are large, I\u2019d no idea this was an option. Apparently this can help with radiotherapy after surgery too. Anyone had this and if so, are you glad you did? Thank youÂ ",
