      "Content": "Hi, I am soon to start chemo. Had bilateral mastectomy so I guess they can't use cannula/picc line to give me the chemo.. I've heard myÂ hospital use a general anaesthetic to put portocaths in. Was wondering how that was for people who have had it done? The general anaesthetic for the mastectomy and lymph clearance completely did me in. I know the procedures aren't comparable but any reassurance welcomed. Also are there any thoughts on whether central lines or ports are easier to cope with? Thanks in advance.",
