    "Content": "Hi You may already have seen your surgeon by now, but i thought I would post my experience hoping it will help. Like you, I was convinced when I went to see my surgeon that i wanted a double mastectomy. I did not have a history of breast cancer in the family, but I had a history of cysts and in fact had left the cancer for a long time thinking it was just another cyst. As I also had lumps (cysts) in my other breast, I was convinced that I wanted both removed due to the worry they would cause me in the future. I had a fantastic surgeon who chatted to me for ages about the pros and cons and she suggested that I have one done to start with, but that she would remove the second at a later point if that is what i wanted. So I had one breast removed and total lymph clearance. A year later - I have not worried like I thought I would, but I think that is down to the fact that my surgeon had given me options and on my annual visit i have postponed any decision on reconstruction or second mastectomy for another year, which she was totally happy for me to do. My main point is, take your time and find an understanding surgeon. if you have one breast removed, you can still have the other one removed later. Good luck with everything.Â x",
