I've just booked a holiday for the beginning of Oct my hair is now pure white and about an inch long.But I guess they are used to people looking different. I remember when my son was about 15 his passport photo was about 12 I saw the guy in Cyprus look at son back to photo about twice before he waved him through. Worse for me I've just got my driving licence renewal 70 in Nov. Don't want to look like this on my driving licence will have to wait untill last possible moment to get my photo taken.hubby says wear my wig but that makes me look so different if I got pulled up they wouldn't believe me.Oh the joy ",
