    "Content": "he he he, I know what you're going through, started when I was on FEC...continue with Docetaxel and now with the Tamoxifen I wake up every night...I just feel like a new born baby :) I use to read during the night as at 1st I couldn't sleep for 2 hours after waking up. Now I've noticed that if I just take the duvet off for 5 mins, relax my muscles one after one starting from the top of my head going downwards, I go back to sleep :) Not sure if this helps :) A x",
