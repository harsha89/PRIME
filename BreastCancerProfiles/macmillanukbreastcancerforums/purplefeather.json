      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed on Monday 18 April.   Over the last couple of months I've been having test after test for cancer.  In 2002 I had malignant melanoma and they suspected that had returned. Its breast cancer.  I have a breast lump but I also have enlarged lymph nodes under my arm and in my neck (only visible on ultrasound).  I also have skin lesions which have been there for months.  I had the skin lesions tested and the dermatologist was confused, they said they looked like lymphoma but behaved differently under the microscope.  Anyway, they have \"T Lymphocytes\" in them. The breast cancer surgeon is doing a lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy (5 nodes, and this is the fourth time my lymph nodes have been operated on) but he also said he would biopsy the skin lesions again, because they are in the area of my breast lump so look like they are related. The internet says that skin lesions indicate metastasis (secondary) cancer and now I'm panicking!!!   Nobody to talk to until Tuesday. Does anyone know about skin lesions?  anyone had them? Thanks PS.  I'm a single mum of a 2 year old and I'm terrified of having to leave her.  I don't fear death but I do fear leaving her!!!   her father isn't on the scene because he was dangerous, and now I'm scared that if I wasn't here he would get her!  :-((((((",
