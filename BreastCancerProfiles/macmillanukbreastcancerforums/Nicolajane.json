    "Content": "Just found this post about your heart rate. Sorry you have had problems. I have just been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation......irregular heart beat. At the moment I have a monitor attached tome for 48 hrs cos the 2 ecg\u2019s ive had were normal. Anyway I got myself a wee device called a Kardia and managed to get recording of fast irregular heartbeat with some missed beats. The Kardia isn\u2019t cheap but now I know I\u2019ve got atrial Fib it can be treated which will hopefully prevent a stroke! I do not mean to alarm you but check your carotid pulse (in your neck) after exercise or if you feel your heart beating differently. Yes it could well be anxiety ......it doesn\u2019t help with AFib and I have anxiety! Look up the a fib site......they have a similar and very helpful group like this one. I wish you well and hope it IS JUST anxiety. X",
