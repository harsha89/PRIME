    "Content": "I'd be tempted to get it checked out soon as I could. If it's not cancer related you can stop worrying, if they find out it is then the early diagnosis is what you want. Just to let you know I have been having awful back ache low right hand side. Have been checked out and no cancer, so we think it muscular, I can live with that. Good luck what ever you do xxxx",
