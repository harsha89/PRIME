Does anyone know or have had experience.....Having mastectomy due to large area of DCIS, what happens if invasive is found in the breast tissue ? Surely if they are removing the breast then its not an issue as such?? They are also removing lymph nodes so I know they will be tested. Love to all Andrea x",

Bras - So do I need to go out and but  non under wired bras? I obviously have one pert boob that doesnt move and then my normal one. Im only a c cup but without a bra its very noticeable...so will need to give the other a little lift so to speak....whats anoyones experience of this... I go on holiday in 5 weeks and already stressing about bikini/swim wear :-( Oh and will I be able to sunbathe?? My new boob still hurts to touch..I assume thats normal? Thankyou so much in advance Andy x",

If I have mastectomy they will reconstruct at the same time. Its so hard..Ive gone from being told its probably nothing to 'Just dcis' to poss mastectomy in the space of a few weeks... xxx",

Obviously I know there is no guarantees even with a mastectomy but must be less likely as most of the breast tissue is gone.. My DCIS presented with a lump which is very unusual apparently which is why they are surprised no invasive found so far... My SIL has just finished her Chemo, had op last week so just waiting for her results too..I only started checking mine when she got diagnosed... So hard being given the choice so to speak of which route to take  xx",

At my check up yesterday I asked what would happen if any invasive is found but my consultant who is lovely just said he doesnt like to deal with what ifs just what he knows! He seems confident nothing will be found but every app since Jan things got worse! Just wondered if anyone has any experience the same as me? Many thanks Andrea x",
