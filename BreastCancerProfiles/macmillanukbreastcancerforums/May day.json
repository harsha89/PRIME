      "Content": "Thanks for your replies. I have been prescribed Pyridoxine 50mg tablets to take twice a week and nothing else. Should I be heading back to the GP now and getting a review?  I have a trip coming up soon and I'm regretting booking it, as I don't think my feet are going to cope with much walking. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",

      "Content": "Hi there. Does anyone have any advice about dealing with peripheral neuropathy?  I have had numbness in my toes now since half way through Tax and I finished this at the end of April.  The numbness has remained the same. I've been taking vitamin B for a few weeks as prescribed by the hospital, but I can't say this has made any difference. Some days I just can't bear to be in my feet. Any suggestions please?",

      "Content": "Hi All. Just wanted to thank you all for your advice and support.  Yesterday I went to see my GP about the numbness in my toes.  Her answer was to refer me to a neurologist and write to my oncologist. I wasn't happy with that as I had hoped for some help there and then. So today I contacted a Breast Care Nurse, she has spoken to my Consultant who has now prescribed me Amitriptyline to take daily. I'm really hopeing this is going to help, as the numbness is really slowing my recovery down as I can't bear to be on my feet for long.The B6 I had prescribed is twice a week, I need to get this checked and B12 too,  then hopefully I will be armed to battle through this. Good luck to you all with your own battles! Xx",
