      "Content": "Hi Cazza Forgive me for jumping into this thread - BUT I felt I had to respond! You have done NOTHING to feel ashamed about. It is your husband who should be ashamed and certainly not you. True friends will understand that and will be there for you loving you and supporting you in whatever decisions YOU choose to make. The burden of keeping this all under wraps is too heavy for one to bear without support. I hope that there is at least one friend that you feel you can confide in face to face for those essential hugs. Whatever you decide to do - we are here for you. I cant hug you in person, but am sending you a virtual mega squishy ((((((hug)))))) Take care sweetheart Lozza xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Simba Having been a lifelong smoker, stopping between pregnancies and then starting up again (!!!) I finally gave the weed up!! I have to say that I did not think it would be possible as I've always viewed my smoking needs in much the same way an alcoholic views his alcohol!! And ... I enjoy smoking!! Preferring menthol cigarettes ... anything up to 20 a day! Well I haven't had a REAL cigarette since 8 September 2012!! I have it on my iPhone to remind me that its 20 weeks and 5 days since my REAL smoke!!! Brilliant huh?! And if I can do it anyone can!! It's simple - it's about weaning yourself off... all the CRAP inside the REAL cigarettes. I enjoy smoking BUT I don't like the thought of all the poisons, the expense and smelly clothes and breath. So I invested in e-cigarettes! That way I could still hold a cigarette and have the benefit of 'smoking' the vaporised air which produces 'smoke!' Yes it feels a bit 'fatter' than a real cigarette but I soon got used to it. And it's far, far cheaper. There are lots of different varieties out there but in the end I went for VIP because I was satisfied it'd undergone rigorous testing. There are some shopping Malls that have kiosks where you can try it for free!! That was how I got started and I've never looked back. If you need any other info just get in touch and I'll gladly help. You may have to copy the following link into you web browser. http://www.vipelectroniccigarette.co.uk/promotional-offers-c-32.html If you do go down this route then I would DEFINITELY you buy 2 batteries so that you have a spare! I tried it - and had the strongest strength (they recommend that) and never looked back. I hardly 'smoke' at all now but it's there if I want it so I don't feel deprived!! Good luck to you - it's really really easy!! Especially if you enjoy a smoke and looks pretty convincing if you go for the tip that glows orange rather than blue or green lol!! Lozza xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sascha Just want you to know that I'm thinking of you. So glad you're meeting someone there but sad its not OH (other half). Cancer does make you question life and re-evaluate the things that we once thought were important. Our fears about being on our own for instance. I hope that today has a good outcome for you and that you get peace of mind in whatever you choose to do about OH. Sending big hugs and positive vibes to you. Take care. Lozza xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kittycat I thought I'd see if I could find something for you... Not sure if its helpful to you but its worth a try... You'll have to copy/paste link into your browser as this site does not let you put links in (ggrrrr!!). http://www.tnbcfoundation.org/clinicaltrials.htm It is an American site I know but you may find something useful... even discussing treatments and comparing/seeing what's out there with like minded people can be helpful in giving you something to discuss with your Onc. Do hope you find it useful - apologies if you've already been on there! Sending you a super squishy hug (cos I feel you need one) Lozza xx",
