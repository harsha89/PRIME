      "Content": "Well i have no answers really. The consultant had a feel and said there was definitely a lump and some thickening of breast tissue which he wanted a mammogram of straight away. He said then you will come back on monday and have an ultra sound and probably a biopsy. I had the mammogram then the nurse said my ultrasound woukd be on monday 11th march! I said but the consultant said it would be this monday coming.She said im sorry but that clinic is already full and you cant come to the other clinics as you will need a biopsy and they only happen on a monday when the consultant is there. She said im so sorry we are working on this being a one stop clinic but at the moment you have to come back for ultrasounds and biopsies. Im beside myself i cant wait that long. I feel numb.",
