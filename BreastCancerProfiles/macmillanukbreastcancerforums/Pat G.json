As I hadnt been working much this year we decided on just a small gift to each other cos we wanted the children to continue normal Christmas stuff so money being tight I didnt mind. BUT!! On Christmas morning after all the pressies were opened I was sitting with big grin in my face so happy the kids were happy when what did he carry in only the tiniest pomeranian puppy I ever saw ! Soooo cute !! We have called her Missy & she is adorable but a pain in the butt trying to train her to do her business outside ha ha ha !! So that was a huge surprise for me !Hope Santa was good to you all & I just wanted to wish each & everyone of you a really really happy new year with only good times ahead...

Between hubby me & 2 kids we all take turns taking her outside where she has great freedom to do what needs to be done at least 8 times a day as recommended. This can last at least 20/30 mins at a time which believe me does not go down well !! Anyway she does nowt outside even though encouraged to go to toilet !! BUT as soon as she is back indoors she poops or pees unknown to anyone the wee maggot !! Oh its just so annoying especially when Im getting on with other things while hubby & kids are just watching tv or on laptop or PS3... aaarrrggghhhh !! BUT i love her to bits so getting a man over on Sat to help me as Im back to work full time now ... Aw the joys ha ha xxx As for the walking she is sooo tiny that just going to the piers & back she falls asleep as she only 7 weeks old ... STILL a wee maggot !! Ha ha ...Patricia xx",

I spent 6 days in hospital & got the last of my 4 drains removed the morning I was discharged. I was up and about the day I came home but please please do take it easy & one day at a time. Each day you will find yourself getting stronger, but rest will help you recover. Avoid lifting anything heavy and if you have to lift something from the floor be sure to get down on your hunkers to do it dont bend over as this will put pressure on your wound. I wish you the very best of luck with your procedure & speedy recovery. Will include you in my prayers as I do with all my BC buddies on here.Take care & dont forget to take it easy... Patricia xxx",

If its not bad enough to go through full mastectomy, complete lymph node removal & ld flap reconstruction - then the chemo & radiotherapy still to come - How long do you suffer all the recovery of pain from surgery. The tightness in my back, under arm & chest is unreal. I had my op on 26th April & have had twinges of pain up to today. I went back to work today - sitting at desk with wonderful boss so did not get up to much believe me - the only way I can explain the sensations Im feeling is as if a baby is kicking around my scars, not all the time on & off but with a tightening hot feeling. Is this normal ? How long will it go on ? I have no patience for being off work as I would end up getting treatment for my head instead of the \"C\". Has anyone else had this or am I being a real wuss ?",

You try & get your head around all the procedures ( although I really did not want to know - I just told my consultant to get the wee f****er out & kick it around the place & then set fire to it!! - seriously I did ) So my main concern at the time was just to get all out of me & that was as far I could deal with at the time. Now my head is telling my body to cop on that all is gone & I should be back to normal now but Im not. The healing pains which I have decided to call them can be horrendous at times. I did look it up here on the site & seemingly all the nerves are starting to work again & that can cause all the shootings of pain. I just did not prepare myself for all the healing. My consultant -WHO IS MY GOD, A FANTASTIC MAN WITH WONDERFUL HEALING HANDS, I HAVE BEEN TOTALLY BLESSED TO HAVE HIM - did stress how huge the surgery would be so I guess theres not much else I can do now but (inwardly scream!!!) wait with frustration. Sorry about the rant - Im preparing myself for a good day so all the bad thoughts are gone ! Thanks xxx",

Its just you know when you get a pain - you kind of think, well is this normal? Am I suppossed to be getting these horrendous pains? I was telling Kate there I have decided to call them my \"Healing Pains\" to comfort me.. ha ha ha !! Your experience sounds exactly like what I have but some of my sharp pains would make me hold my breath. I dont so much have pain in the new boob more like weird weird sensations) it is mostly all in my back which feels like Im the hunchback of Notre Dam. Sometimes I even strip in the bathroom to look at my back because it feels so weird I get convinced it is going to look weird. Hope we can keep in touch now that I know we are on the same road, even though your a right few miles ahead of me - good to know your here to let me know about the journey. Thanks so much xxxx",

Im sitting here modelling my new wig which to be honest looked a lot better in the shop :( Hubby thinks Im not wise sitting wearing it while Im blessed to still have full head of hair but am thinking Im breaking in gradually to the idea.

We get really low then beat ourselves up thinking we are feeling sorry for ourselves but we are not we are just learning to cope with all the massive changes that are going on in our life that we have no control over. If you can try & put all out of your head until results day because worrying yourself sick is not going to change anything that will be said to you on that day. I hope it is as good as can be expected for you but Chemo & Rads are just another form of kicking cancers butt & sticking 2 fat fingers up in its face ! Dont be worrying over something you have absolutely no control over as it is doing you no good at all. Go out have more fun with your family but take it easy as well... Whatever your outcome, I wish you the very best of luck on your journey. Its a big bus we are all on, just getting off at different stops but the destination is the same for us all.. Healthy normal cancer free life again ! So remember, there are lots of us on here that will give you the support you need. God knows only for this site I really dont know where I would have ended up - everyone is so understanding & offers lots of kindness & support when needed.

Its so much better to let it all out & in a way better if there is no-one around. I was alone one day in the house & I actually howled like an animal I swear it came from my big toe right out my mouth. It was the best thing I could have done. I had a lot of anger building up inside me & like you when others were around I was fine but once alone BANG!! Have a good old cry, scream, shout, howl, do whatever makes you feel better & gives you some release pet. Aw my heart goes out to you, but this is a wonderful place to voice your anger & concerns as we are all on the same bus just getting off at different stops. So, remember - really your never alone when you come on here... You have all of us to help each other. I have had great help on here & all the gals are all so wonderfully kind & thoughtful. Dont be worrying about the drain - it will sort itself out. Just because people say you are strong doesnt mean that you have to be like that all the time - I kept getting txt messages saying that as well & I felt like firing the phone at the wall. It is okay to cry, it is okay to feel like sh1t... Just be sure to talk it through - even on here. Dont let it get in on you. You take care lovey & will say a wee prayer that you WILL get through this,.. Lots of love & hugs, Patricia xxx",

Im not on tamoxifen, though had mx, full node clearance, ld flap recon, 6 x chemo & 25 x rads - all finishing on 2nd Nov. Since being diagoniosed I gave up the dirty fags (which I was only smoking around 5 a day .. I know it doesnt matter how many but trying to take the bad look of it all) So gave them up at the same time & have since put on almost 3 stone being the heaviest I have ever ever been in my life ( even when pregnant with twins !!! )  I googled weight gain with breast cancer & they sait its very common to put weight on in face, neck & belly which is exactly where it has went on,, well okay has went on everywhere but most noticeable where I have said !! I am now suffering terribly with neuropathic pain in my feet which at night time is horrendous at times. I do not want to go on even more meds for this as Dr Google has told me the norm meds for this is anti-depressants / epilepsy meds - dont get me wrong absolutley nothing wrong with these meds but I really want to get all the poison out of me now not pump more in. I am taking Glucosamine + Chondroitin, Omega 3 & Calicum + Vit D religiously since I stopped rads & have been fine up until last week when I seem to be going down hill. My scars are all really painful all the time, my arm aches even though Im doing the exercises religiously every day - it just seems to be that life is going backwards. I plan on doing the mini marathon in June to give me something positive to achieve this year & I really dont want the hassle of all the crap again ! Now, Im getting paranoid ! I did see my surgeon (my hero !!) at teh end of Nov & he was so pleased but have not got any appt yet to see Onc or a follow up scan. Am I being a spoilt little brat ?? I have had one period since the chemo started as well. Aaaarrrggggggghhhhhh !!!!  Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaam !! Want to just cry. Hit the booze a few nights as well just to block it all out ! Im so pissed off that Im even feeling like this !! I do not want to let the tramp get in on me again ! Been there done that got the boob off to prove it ! Why oh why does it still niggle at me like an annoying itch !!! Sooo sorry for the rant ! Has anyone else had this pain or have become as huge as me !! Sooo feeling sorry for myself..

Glucosamine + Choindroitin / Calcium + Vit D / Omega 3 & I have to say it has all really helped me. The numbness only now comes on the balls of my feet if Im really on my feet all the time say out shopping for the day but defo improved from looking like a 90 year old getting out of bed. They did advise only 1 a day of all of the tabs as they said being only 41 that would be fine...

However we are all different so s/e's will be different for each one of us so all we can do is share our experiences so we can compare. For me the 1st round was physically tough with the 2nd one being emotionally tough. Furry tongue & no taste are a bummer for me ! Get Nystatin drops for your mouth as you may get oral thrush. I had to get the Canesten Oral Capsule as well which I took on the Thursday *had chemo on Tues* as it will literally happen over night !! Hot flushes were & still are a bloody pain !! Pineapple & strawberries chilled are good food as I could not taste anything! Carbs were a no no for me. Plenty of water as well. I read somewhere if you suck ice / ice lollies / ice pops during the administration of the drug is helps ease the sore mouth. I still got it but not as bad as first time but it could have been cos I was using the Nystatin from the day after so its hard to know. All I can say to put it all in a nut shell is we just have to take it as it comes... Que sera sera.... I think we get to grips with it all just as its all ending. I did go on a downer on Tax 2 (chemo 5) but that could have been me !! Well, best of luck on your journey I sincerely hope you can handle it all & its not too tough on you... Best of luck pet & lots of hugs & dont be too frightened .. It is al do-able & that is the important thing ! Chemo kills Cancer ;) Patricia xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kittycat, Children are a lot stronger than we think & actually a lot more mature than we give them credit for. I was dreading telling our 12 yr old twins (boy & girl) but I just blurted it out. No fancy frills, just said the medicine would make it fall out but that it was a really good sign as that proved the medicine was working - I never mentioned \"C\" word either - just bad cells that had to be removed. They seemed to have accepted that. I made it fun with the wig - getting them to try it on & making sure there were lots of laughs about it. Now they pass no remarks - they have even come up to me in the room to say we have visitors & dont forget to put your hair on ! Ha ha... Though I do wear a scarf around the house. So I think if you keep it upbeat & make a laugh out of it with them they will handle it - I think the way they handle it reflects on how you handle it. If they see you making no big deal about it they will think the same. I lay awake nights worrying about it before hand & when I done it I felt so silly for feeling so scared ! I really hope all goes well for you Kittycat - Big hugs going your way xxx Patricia xx",

Tell you Mam that your thankful to have her around but your feeling bit tired, go up to your room & lock the door. You might need a good cry. Did your BC Nurse tell you she would ring today - she may just think that once the appt is made that is it. She could be out with other patients today so it may not be common practice with her to contact you. Dont worry about the food - Id say if you have tea & toast or soup or something for the next few days as that may be all you will feel like. Watch out for the bowels & indigestion. They were a real killer for me first time! All very treatable with meds. I got the little sachets to drink which didnt give you the runs just kept you going & take gaviscon for the indigestion. I had number 2 yesterday & so far so good. Im taking the gaviscon & the sachets this time as a precautionary measure ! Just tired & will prob not sleep for the next 2 nights thanks to the wonderful steroids I was given. I think its the not knowing what to expect that leaves us nervous. I dont even know what way this one will go. Oh another thing if you wake up next day & notice a lovely red glow on face & neck it is normal.. ha ha ! I looked like I had sunburn !! Its just a side effect from one of the drugs. I also found the backs of my legs quite tired & heavy. I just wanted to share with you what I had - you may get none of them. It sometimes leaves it easier if you know what you are feeling is normal. You are allowed to be cross, anxious & nervous & any other feelings you might be having. Its only you that can go through it but dont let IT get to you anymore than it already has. It has taken enough control of you & your body- thankfully your going to poison the little bastard out !! Hope you sleep well tonight pet, & if you feel like a good cry it will be a great release for you. I normally run the shower so no one can hear me !! Take care & feel free to rant away - thats why we are all here. Big hugs for tomorrow... Patricia xxx",

I had second dose today which had doseage lowered by 20% due to severe s/e's last time. I had the hot flushes last time but they seem to be a lot worse today. It was so hot & the sweat was literally running down my neck & chest & the flipping wig didnt help. I was mortified as I sat in coffee shop after treatment & smartly thought I would take a napkin & sneak it up inside the front of my wig to soak up the sweat only to pull the napkin down which GOT STUCK !! I nearly died with embarrasment so gals please do not try this in public. The napkin was soaked in sweat & refused to move. Then because I was in a panic it did not help trying to remove it ! I can have a good laugh at it now but the hot flush seemed to last an awful lot longer with that one but most of it was mortification ha ha ha !! So just wondering if its just me or is there anything you can take for it ? Thanks in advance xxx Patricia xxx",

Maybe its just a little tiny dot of it that was not zapped with the chemo & maybe you just need a stronger chemo for a few sessions. It could be just a little blip in your recovery journey.

Next time tell your Onc whom I presume you will meet before your next treatment & tell them your s/e's. If they feel the need they will alter your anti sickness meds. Tiredness is what got to me as well but you must listen to your body & do as it asks - Rest, rest & more rest as needed... The worst for me with the steroids was lack of sleep. I norm got around 3 hours a night which really got to me. Well I hope your feeling much better now, make sure & do something really nice & spoil yourself week before your next treatment. It will give you something to look forward to each time. Take care & stay strong... Hope you get good night sleep. ;) Patricia xxx",

Ended up in A&E on Friday with throat that was starting to close, could not swallow, big swollen dead furry rat where my tongue used to me, infection, severe pain in ears, woeful headache, very tender finger tips (even typing this is sore) and the pains in my feet, legs and arms similar to contractions. And NO ! I am seriously not exaggerating. No taste buds, even a madarin orange felt like raw fish in my mouth. OMG !! I have never felt so sorry for myself ever ! So, I come home armed with the anti biotics, anti inflammatorys, mouth wash, drops for oral thrush, pain killers & a very very sad heart. Even have pains in my gums !!! I sailed through my procedures & honestly thought I was a good patient putting on brave front so that everyone was okay. This has really slapped me hard across the face. Has anyone else had this ? How long does it last ? I think if this is me until chemo is over Im not sure I can go through it all. Oh & just started to get a rash below my neck ! LOVELY !!! So please fellow BC buddies, can you please put my mind at ease that this will pass... We have a very important sports event that my daughter is attending in the capital at the weekend & I will be heartbroken if I feel like this- doesnt seem to matter how much pain relief I take the pain stays. Meds just leave me feeling real dopey ! Aw guys, where is the light at the end of the tunnell that I thought I saw a glimpse of (that was when I was steroid induced though) Getting very very depressed. Even my son asked me tonight was I going to die - I have to drag my feet along the floor as its so sore to lift them :( That just broke my heart so of course I locked myself in the loo & cried my heart out.

Im down at the unit today to get my picc line dressing changed so will have another wee chat with the nurses to see what the story is.

You gals are amazing support - no matter what hour of the day coming on here & being able to rant & rave really does help ;) Taking the tramadol has really helped with the pain but it does leave me feeling bit dopey on it ?!??!! Got the Laxido sachets from FEC last time so thanks gals, will take it to help with constipation, Cant remember when I last went to the loo ! YIKES !! Too much info ??? Ha ha... But ya know your in the right place when even talking about things like that dont embarrass you. Well here's hoping you all have a lovely day & thanks for everything as always...

I was a nervous wreck going in as I was sneezing all night & having mad hot flushes so was afraid my bloods might not be right or my temp was up or that aliens had landed & stole the chemo unit ! But no ! Good luck was for once going my way !! But thank the Lord, the horrible hateful evil Docetaxol went aflowing through my veins & I cherished every moment knowing it was the last one ! Yes, will never have to sit in a big armchair or lie in a bed in a chemo unit again ( please God, fingers, toes & all other bits crossed ) Even got my picc line removed as my Onc said would not be needed after today so that really made me believe all was good ! So as far as the horrid s/e's to follow well they wont really kick in until Thur eve or Friday so until then Im going to make the most of it - apart from the streroids stealing my sleep at the mo ! Wonder would it be safe to go out for a meal & few glassed of vino tomorrow evening. I will have taken all my steroids by tomorrow evening along with anit sickness tabs that last up until Friday & I have to get my Neulasta jab tomorrow as well... so what do you reckon girlies... Would I be mad to have a few drinks with my mates to celebrate last chemo tomorrow eve or should I wait until week after next as that will be when I will feel normal again please God... Thanks in advance my lovelies for your advice & hope anyone who had chemo today or the rest of the week that it all goes as good as can be expected for you all.. Just incase by the time you read to the end of this post you may have forgotten.................................... I HAD MY LAST CHEMO TODAY !!! YIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!!

Yep Im now calling it the Docetaxol Dumper Truck ! It had a hit out on me, got me ran me over & had left me for dead ! I can just about type this - taking forever going back & correcting all mistakes - putting one foot in front of the other is a job & half - even have all the pains in legs & feet while lying down. Then Im too warm, put the fan on - then Im too cold put on more layers - then back again !! Oh sweet divine !! This is not even funny !! Have an awful sore throat, the tongue is getting bigger by the hour ! Can I possibly barge any more ! OMG !! I am almost finished a bottle of the Nystatin hubby thinks there is drugs in it & Im addicted ha ha !! Oh we have to laugh dont we ! Well I have not managed to catch up on any posts as I have been sleeping most of the time from Wed night but when I am normal again I will get back on track & see how you are all keeping. I have been rinsing & gargling with hot water & salt which has seemd to ease a bit ( just in case some might like to try ) Well take care everyone & im off to sleep for the weekend, catch up real soon... All of you enjoy the weekend, I dont care its raining here so good enough excuse to go back to bed ha ha !! All the best & lots of love, Patricia xxx",

I know exactly how you feel but I was saying exactly this to my Onc today & she said the best cure for it was to keep walking that exercise was best medicine for the achey legs & feet ! Sound stupid & I did actually say this but she said it was the best thing for it !! So I have been pushing myself more today with the walking - tough but if it helps will be worth it. Hope your feeling better really soon pet - I guess by now you know my opinion on the poison but I had my last one today & even though my s/e's were shit looking back it is all do-able !

      "Content": "Well Gals, Im back in the land of the living! I went to hospital on Monday where I was admitted with high temp & literally non-existant white blood cell count! Came out in horrible red itchy sore rash along the top of my chest. Had throad closing in, sores with severe dryness in my nose, oral thrush, thrush down below and severe pain in my feet leaving that I could not walk very far. They put me on IV anti biotics there & then. Was then sent for chest x-ray. Had loads of swab tests & blood tests & blood cultures done. Monday was a very surreal scary experience for me & I spent most of Monday night crying myself to sleep. The nurses were lovely & let hubby stay unitl well after 11 but he had work the next day & had to sort the kids out as well. So I was discharged yesterday with a bag full of drugs that left me fearing I may get mugged by some druggie ha ha !! It took a while for bloods to come up as they were so dangerously low & the high temp was hard to stabilise so had fan on my locker 24-7 while I was in. So Im back home & they never found out where the infection was but said that was quite common to never know where the infection was! Well Im home again anyway & thats the main thing. My Onc. popped over to me on Tues. & said she would \"tweak\" the next dose - I only have 2 more to go & Im not as scared now knowing what can be expected, I just took a really really bad reaction to it which does not happen everyone - I just wanted to prepare & warn people what can happen & not to be frightened by it all. Then I come out of the shower today & notice where a stitch was left in by a drain (which I showed to 2 Doc's & both said it would go away by itself - had surgery done end of April.. this is now mid Aug?? who am I to question a doc??) anyway to find puss coming out of it! Lovely! So I kinda squeezed what I could & washed around it again & now just keep putting sudocrem on it all the time. Im now wondering would this have been the source of the infection & should I contact a doctor about this. Its just that Im only home & really dont want to have to face a hospital again !! So what do I do ? just keep the sudocrem on it. there is no pain at all from it ! Weird !! Some people had these s/e's on FEC which I breezed through so it proves we are all different people just fighting the same war !! So I hope you are all keeping okay since I was last on here girlies.. stay strong & keep fighting !! Big hugs to you all & best of luck to anyone getting treatments today... Hope you all have a wonderful weekend & enjoy the wonderful sunshine... Patricia xxx",

If it does get painfully unbearable they may drain it for you ( again all normal ) Keep the arm moisturised & bio oil on the scars & do the exercises you are allowed to do for the time frame from surgery - this may also help. If the swelling is not too painful to touch even massaging it with some moisturiser may even help ! I am still swollen from April but I had Ld flap as well so was told it was normal too - Hope your feeling better real soon pet - take care pet. Patricia xxx",

      "Content": "First of all Shelley, congrats on getting over the Chemo!! You defo have the worst bit done believe me!!Best of luck for the op on Thursday - it will all be fine and you will be back on your feet in no time.. Dont bring any perfumed products as these can not be used where node removal is so bring Simple washing products - no deodorant on that side Im afraid & I was so paranoid about that (ok on good side) so bring some nice perfumes or body sprays that you can spray on your pjs - defo button down pj tops so much easier with drains and when surgeon comes in to check on wounds etc.. - Johnsons are doing lovely new lavender wipes that smell gorg bring something like that to keep your hands, face etc refreshed during the day. Not sure how long you will be in as I had 8.5 hours op of mastectomy, full node removal & ld flap all in one op so Im in a different bus to you - but if your any for any length, bring the dry shampoo spray & get someone to put it in for you it was a God send for me as I was in for 7 days. Drains are grand honest dont be worrying - they wont come out ! Do bring face cloths & towels ( get someone to bring in fresh ones daily to save space in your bag! Send home all washing each day as well. Keeps the bag empty as possible for going home. DRINK DRINK DRINK LOADS OF WATER - this really helps with the healing process of your wounds, flushes out the anaesthetci & keeps your skin from drying up. Watch out for constipation which is caused by pain relief - nurse told me to drink hot water & kiwis in the morning & I swear it worked ! I could not settle to read books either but found magazines easier to flick through. Bring in mints as well, keeps your mouth refreshed. Bring in a wee fleecy blanket to keep the mastectomy warm - helps with healing - OH maybe that is just for recon wounds though - But I was told to bring warm fleecy blanket to keep wound warm for good blood flow. But that could be for the recon ld flap... Cant think of anything else so all I can do now is send you very best of luck for the op ! you will be grand. Big hugs xoxoxo Patricia xxx",

Guess we just have to get used to it - small price to pay & all that. The exercises defo help - I do them religiously every day, Remember to moisturise your arm massaging the creme in moving always upwards from your wrist into your shoulder blade - NEVER down the ways ( to prevent lymphodema) & put bio oil on the scar. I find doing the exercise just after I do this really helps. So this is just my experience but have been told by surgeon totally normal so hope this helps put your mind at ease.

I personally would never tell other people what to do in this matter as every person & situation is different & I am sure they have their reasons - their Mam being one of them. I have one session of chemo left but I have a young family so I really wanted to fire all I could at the hateful cancer !! I will then go for rads as well - At lease if the little fecker ever ever dares rear its ugly little head again I will be content knowing that I done all I could. But this is only my outlook on it & if I were in your partners shoes or anyone elses for that matter the decisions may well have been different. So sorry I cant help but what I really wanted to say was I think your partner is a very very lucky person to have someone so thoughtful in her life to come on to the site on their behalf. You first post really touched my heart & actually at first made me a little jealous as my hubby treated my cancer like a toothace and the chemo as a filling of a tooth ! So when I see someone who has such love & respect like yours it really touched me. They are one very lucky person & I hope they know this - show them this message from me !! Ha ha !! Anyway, whatever their decision is, you just being by their side to support them is all they will need. I wish you both every pray with the best of luck on your journey ahead.
