    "Content": "Hi Cat, I'm new to all this too & actually feeling nervous about posting on here!  We have a very similar diagnosis -- grade 2 , clear margins & clear lymph nodes. I got told about the ER+ & also HER+ when I got my other results (on 5th Dec) so have been on Tamoxifen since then. They told me there was little advantage in having Herceptin - I guess because other things clear so won't be having that. I am due to have radiotherapy & have appointment to see oncologist on Monday so hope to find out when I will start.  It is all rather scary & confusing but just reading about other people's experiences has actually calmed me down quite a lot! Too easy to worry about the what ifs & scare yourself silly!  Best wishes, Carole xxx",
