      "Content": "I felt quite ok about the outcome yesterday but today I feel anxious again. The not knowing I guess.. Is it normal for your arm to feel heavy after a mammogram? The top of my left arm feels like it does when you have an injection..although right side is fine  ",

      "Content": "Today I saw the consultant about my armpit ache and boob dent.. straight away he said he could feel a lump so sent me off for a mammogram and ultrasound. Both of which came back clear but he wants me to have an MRI and see him again in 3 months as apparently some breast cancers show up much clearer on the MRI and not at all on mammogram and ultrasound? Anyway, he said going on today's results I don't have breast cancer.. so that's good enough for me. So far so good ",

      "Content": "I saw my GP yesterday about my aching armpit and boob dent.. she gave me a jolly good prod (to the point I'm feeling bruised today) and she's referred me to the breast clinic. GP wasn't sure if she could feel a lump or if it was breast tissue. Hospital phoned today and I have to go next Tuesday (28/02) at 3pm. Glad the appointment has come through quickly but i'm now dreading it!  ",
