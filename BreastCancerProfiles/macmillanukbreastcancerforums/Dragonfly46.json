      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Thank you for your reply. I have looked further online and apparently some stage 3 cancers are operable and some aren't. It is usual protocol to shrink it first though if it is operable. Apparently my surgeon thinks it is as she is prepared to operate. She did tell me if she did it before shrinkage it would have been a different operation and it would be easier if it was smaller and detached from the chest wall. They hope the regime I am on will facilitate this. I do not want to get PALs involved as I have no basic problem with my two consultants - I am hoping before July they get together again. Dragonfly",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2018. I have a tumour under my breast in the chest wall and one in the breast. The one under is oestrogen positive and the smaller one in the breast is triple negative.  My consultant put me on Anastrozole to shrink the larger tumour and then referred me to an oncologist who added Kisqali (Ribociclib) to help with the shrinkage. At the time my consultant told me she could operate there and then (a mastectomy) but she would prefer to wait until it had shrunk somewhat.  I have been seeing the oncologist every 4 weeks for a repeat prescription. On Tuesday although there is some shrinkage she told me it was inoperable and she thought is should be zapped with radiotherapy to contain it. I said my consultant had said it was operable and she just said okay thats all right then! Meanwhile the other tumour is being untreated so I am having an MRI to see how that is going.  Now I am not sure who to believe. I am not sure which of them is the senior and which of them is in charge.  I am seeing both of them again in July - the consultant first and the oncologist later in the month.  I am not sure what to do or whether to just wait and see.",
