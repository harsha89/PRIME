    "Content": "Hello    I thought I would share with you my experience of Diep Flat reconstruction (5 Days ago )   In 2012 I was diagnosed with grade 3 Lobular Breast cancer in my left breast    Although I was vigalent and checked constantly I missed it  ( lobular Cancer presents as a soft thickening and not an obvious lump)   then one day whilst in the shower washing my hair I felt a pulling sensation in my armpit and found a tiny lump   At the hospital I had a mammogram, ultrasound neither of which showed any abnormalities    A biopsy was taken and two weeks later showed cancerous cells    So after Chemo radiotherapy two tumour excisions and node clearance, removal of my ovaries and tubes  I went on the waiting list to have a double mastectomy with Diep reconstruction it took a year for me to be called 17 /3/15 ...2 days before my 49 th birthday    The op took 10 hours they removed two ribs to get to the arteries they needed to use    I spent the first night in intensive care at the Royal Marsden in Fulham, then on the ward for 3 days, then home on the fourth day ( yesterday)    I feel bruised battered and generally rotten   but happy and hugely relieved    I have no Breast tissue or nipples to worry about    my risk of reoccurrence in the Breast is massively reduced !!   I am now going to be able look forward to a long and happy future with my family    so far I am recovering well and having had two previous C Sections the stomach pain isn't any worse and I don't have a newborn to look after    Consider your options and leave yourself time to decide    for me it was an absolute   thank you for listening    love    Budkin x                              ",
