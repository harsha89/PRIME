      "Content": "Hi We recently had the diagnosis of secondary BC in the spine. It\u2019s been a few weeks now and we have settled into a holding pattern. Still waiting for the biopsy results so getting more apprehensive as time goes by. My wife is currently ER+ based on primary cancer which was diagnosed and treated just short of 5 years ago. Currently having endocrine therapy combined with bioposphinates. I am operating as her proxy on the forum as it keeps her stronger at the moment to contain her exposure to \u2018stories\u2019. we've looked into the Care Oncology Clinic and have read Jane Mc Lellands book \u2018How to starve cancer\u2019. That is definitely a topic of interest and would be interested to speak with people who understand the metabolic pathways of cancer, maybe even used the information for adjunctive treatments. Beyond that I think it is just good for me reach out and speak with people going through the same thing. We have two young children 6,9 (that is there age, not their names). They are currently only aware of the symptoms my wife is experiencing and I believe that is all they need to know until we know more. So speaking with children would also be of interest. Thanks chris",

      "Content": "While I find the tone a bit blunt, I understand and appreciate what you are saying and no we are not expecting a magic bullet/wand. we just want the best chance of beating and or reaching the prognosis. That doesn\u2019t mean evade. If indeed it doesn\u2019t go that way then we will have tried. And as yet we have no real prognosis, until that is delivered we will not know how our future looks. Or if indeed there is cause to look at our options. Hope and fight is important, as is blind faith for some. I am probably not allowed to post links but there is a site which is run internationally providing free research based nutritional advice specifically for your cancer. \u2018Care across\u2019. I\u2019ve just received a guidance sheet which is quite good. It\u2019s doesnt say \u2018hey we can cure you\u2019 but it does say why you should eat or not eat x, y or z.",

      "Content": "Frustrated with the choice of language perhaps. Talking about clutching at straws seems a bit premature. but I do understand the sentiment. As for No and Yes, absolutely agree. We were about to be thrust into a big family meal. Too much too soon. I had to be more straight forward than I wanted to be whenI declined. I think a laying down of ground rules with all of the support network would be very useful. Thanks Chris",

      "Content": "Your story is very reassuring and similar to my wife\u2019s in many ways. I know it\u2019s no guarantee but still illustrates there is often life beyond stage 4 diagnosis. We\u2019re definitely in it for the long haul and as of yet don\u2019t know  the full picture. We know there is no other soft tissue involvement. Which is good. However two vetebrae have pathological fractures so bone strengthening is imperative now. Possible strengthening surgery to come if bone treatment goes well. We\u2019re waiting and I know there will be much more waiting to come.  Thanks Chris",

      "Content": "Thanks puzzler we feel this is definitely the case regarding treatments. The next generation of treatments is coming through and things are moving so fast. i read an article in the news about how, in a decade or so, cancer will be a manageable chronic disease. This is very exciting time for research.  And our thoughts are also that some of today\u2019s complimentary treatments could well be the building blocks of these bigger ideas. Time will tell. But thanks for taking the time to wish us well. ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the tips. I will seek out other support chats too. I feel like we\u2019re old hands at this after the initial treatment. My wife had neoadjuvant chemo, lumpectomy and radiotherapy. Then TMX ever since. Not so much good that has done :( I too am a little skeptic of \u2018therapies\u2019 but the book my wife read is very interesting and not only does it track the story of a person with cancer (the author) it also has a happy ending (so far). I am pretty analytical by nature and it makes a lot of sense. We\u2019ve been open with the Onc and they are happy for us to explore some of the ideas as they have no interactions with treatment. Now being Stage 4 means all bets are off. We will not be passive in the treatment of this disease. We don\u2019t expect any miracles but even if it empowers us to fight and learn more about the cancer then I think that\u2019s a good thing. i agree though it is not for everyone, although I would encourage anyone to read the book. Even if just to form an opinion. With respect to the kids, we\u2019re just biding our time. We have no prognosis as yet so we need to deal with that ourselves first. We thought it was the end three weeks ago when they told us... but this always has a tendency to make you feel like this. I worry about our next visit because we can live in cuckoo land right now but we know that\u2019s going to end very soon.",
