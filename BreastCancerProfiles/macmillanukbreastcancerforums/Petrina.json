WLE + 5 lymph nodes removed. 15 sessions Radiotherapy. started Tamoxifen 3 months ago.  relieved treatment all finished but am exhausted. constantly tired. tearful. anxious. everyone expects you to just bounce back to the person you were before. i will never be that person again. ! its very hard.  chemo made me go through early menopause. so as well as side effects of Tamoxifen going thru menopause too. not sleeping properly. i was tearful xmas day thinking is this my last xmas. who knows! but am trying to focus on other things fgor next 3 months until i go back for check up.  cry when you need to. i do. music helps me + comedies. you are not alone. take care xxx",

      "Content": "I seriously considered the cold cap but when I got to the chemo unit and the nurses there told me if it was them they would not use it as even though there is no guarantee that hair does not fall out with it but they advised me that the chemo will get to all parts of the body including the scalp - as there could be a floating cancer cell lurking there!  Had not thought of it in that respect - so for me I was glad they told me that.  I wanted to make sure I would not have to go through all of this again just to keep my hair! I was diagnosed in March and by end of November I have now had 4 sessions of Chemo, WLE and Lymph node removal and 15 sessions of Radiotherapy. Am now on the Tamoxifen for at least 5 yrs possibly 10  yrs.   My hair is short thick and 50 shades of Grey now!!!  Good Luck with it all. Petrina x",

Underneath there was a little nail already growing half way but I had long nails so it was painful for them to come away and come off about 3 or 4 days after it comes loose.   I still have little ridges on the new nails - but my last chemo is now over 6 months ago. Hope this helps. x",

It feels here we go again ! :(  It is really onlo now that it is hitting me with all I been through this year, and the exhaustion is now setting in! I had chemo then lumpectomy WLE and lymph nodes removed then 15 radium treatment and now starting at the beginning again. Am hoping its not come back already! Family never really saw me at my lowest after chemo - always put on a brave face and made sure my bald head was covered either with a scarf or wig.  Didn't think they could cope with seeing me like that.  Some friends kept away and messaged saying they couldn't come to see me as they couldn't cope!!!You always get others who walk across the street when they see you coming. Some people really can't handle the word Cancer. But we have to and have to be strong and positive to get thru it. xx",

I had joint pains everywhere - could barely stand let alone walk.  Crying with pain - I had Co-codamol but was prescribed Tramadol for pain relief.  Ask if you can get Tramadol for the pain. Thankfully I didn't need the further 2 chemos as they had originally planned as they decided to operate sooner.  I did manage to self inject after District Nurse did the first 2  . I so sympathise with you  but as soon as the injections stop the pains amazingly ease.  Stay strong. xx",

IDC  tumour size 3 cm. as i was quite fit n healthy i had chemo first only 4 i needed then they operated. i had umpetcomy and 5 lymph nodes removed. prior to chemo i had ct scan and bone scan. all routine tests. started tamoxifen in sept and finished 15 sessions of radiotherapy.  its been a rollercoaster ride. am now v v tired but its natural apparently. not being seen now until march. what i recently found out i have cysts on both my ovaries ( these were found from ct scan but i wasnt told til now!) but i been assured not to worry even though no further tests for those done! i await bracca test results in march. dependent on that i might have a big decision to make.   it will be tough but you can do this. you will have days when you think you can't continue but you will get strength.  chemo for me was the worst.  good luck with it all. before you know it you too will be at the end of it like us. take care and Merry Xmas. xxxx",
