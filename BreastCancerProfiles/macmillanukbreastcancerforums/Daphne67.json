      "Content": "One week to surgery and just been diagnosed with a second (new) primary cancer in the other breast. I was kind of expecting this in a way after the MRI/biopsy and thought I was getting my head round the first diagnosis (back in December) yet the new diagnosis seems to have knocked me for six and I feel numb. When I don't feel numb I feel angry.  Now I have a choice of a lumpectomy on that side or a bilateral mastectomy. I thought if that happened I would find it easy to opt for the bilateral but it's not that simple. If I keep my other breast then it's possible I may have to have a mastectomy down the line anyway, though I will retain some sensation in the other breast. I feel like I should opt for the bilateral mastectomy but then I will have no sensation at all. It seems like I have some big decisions to make at a time when I don't feel able to make them. I am also feeling pretty angry if I'm honest, not that it makes any difference, this new cancer, in the big scheme of things. The support network at Bart's is very good, psychologist and group support sessions but I am finding it hard to talk about at the moment to other people outside of this network. I have friends I've known for 30 years who just say 'keep me posted' rather than interact with me or call me. I don't  feel like keeping them posted.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I think take the advice given and use the helpline and/or have a chat to your BCN. I was due to have mine and it didn't impact on it or delay the surgery it but I did mention it. Also you would need to check if you normally take any painkillers etc for it as that may be an issue. All best for your surgery. Daphne",
