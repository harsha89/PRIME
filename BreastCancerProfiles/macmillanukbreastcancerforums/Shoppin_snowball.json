      "Content": "Hello  Bit of advice needed  Iam having a double skin spearing diep mastectomy surgery in April 18 and am wondering if anyone can advise post surgery underwear , I\u2019m not sure how soon after the op I will be wearing a bra I don\u2019t know what size I will be after surgery other than I will be smaller than what I am now (DD/E cup)  Do I buy bigger for swelling -do they need to be tight for support ??  I will have drains so not sure where they will fit ? Same with knickers to avoid my tummy scar -I\u2019m guessing Bridget Jones\u2019s  Any experiences or things that worked for you ladies would be really helpful  Thanks all  Claire ",
