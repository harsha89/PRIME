What would people recommend? I have been told non-wired bras, although I am worried i wont be able to manoeuvre myself to actually put one on. Was thinking big sports bra or a secret support vest instead - but al the while, I am worried about how I can put stuff like this on without over stretching etc....  any advice greatly appreciated....! :) ",

      "Content": "hey Jules,  well done for getting through the surgery - in my opinion (and everyone has different experiences) the worst is now over for you - i hope so anyway.  i am a teacher of small children, and did not return to work throughout my chemo. this did stress me out, as i was actually feeling perfectly fine to be there - but i kept away as i was worried about catching nasty bugs from the kids etc and did not want to miss any chemos through illness. it really depends on your job and how you are feeling - it may be good to do just mornings, or just afternoons - you never know how you will feel.  i am back at work now after 5 months off - and thank god - i was going insane with boredom!! i am starting RT in about 4 weeks ish and intend to work throughout  (luckily, the hopsital is about 5 mins from my house - so i can get there easily for the daily RT sessions). however, i heard that you can feel tired and maybe sore - so i will have to cross that bridge when i come to it.  stay positive though - and if you do have to take time off work - find a good hobby to keep you occupied! i bought a sewing machine and have created all manner of lovely items - it really keep me motivated! good luck to you anyway - hopefully your chemo will be finished by november and your holiday - so you can have a really lovely celebration. take care and rest up xx :)       ",

I had my final chemo last wed and I now believe that the 'build up' of side effects has crept up on me, all at once like some beast. I've been fine until now.... I feel like I have pigged out on about 20 big macs and have this horrible 'full' feeling making me really uncomfortable. That horrid taste in my mouth is still here and to top it all off, I now have the severe aches all over my upper body and cannot move! I have been sleeping really badly and waking in the night due to fullness and constipation, grim :( so am really tired too.... My face and skin are all so soft, which sounds nice, but it is a weird feeling, which I don't like so much (does anyone else get this?) and I also feel like I am about 20 stone! I'm fed up with it now, I am not moaning - just living with it, but tonight just felt like venting my frustrations!! Do any of you guys get the same kind of side effects. I am sure these are very mild and I know that some people get much worse!!!    ",

      "Content": "hey Siklady,  I have had the cold cap and it worked for me. I began FEC in december and finished on march 30th and I still had hair at the end. I had really long hair and was desperate to keep it. I had my first FEC on 13th Dec and my hair began falling out properly on NYE - and i had it cut to chin length  - against my will I might add!! On about the 6th Jan, after my 2nd chemo, I reluctantly had my hair chopped off to a crop do, like the one in my pic. My hair is still the same as this and having short hair, defo made the hair loss easier to cope with. I guess I am one of the lucky ones  in that respect, as I am certainly not as brave as those who cope with severe hairloss. So, i would say - try it  - take those pain killers before see how you go....you never know! on the whole exercise front, I am like you - I love going to the gym and was gutted that this whole experience would mean that I could not continue. I stopped my gym membership after the first op on the lymph nodes as was worried about using my arm and hurting myself further. I also had a PICC line, which meant no swimming. Throughout the chemo, I tried hard to go walking every day. Now it is practically all over, I am excited about re-joining the gym and being able to go spinning again, swimming  etc, although I imagine it will still be a while until I get to do body pump or running  -since I only had the op 2 weeks ago!! Everyone is different though, the chemo did not really wipe me out too much and i was able to continue as normal - but for other people it has. A positive attitude definitely saw me through it all and I always say that with a positive attitude you can conquer anything. Going to  the gym and keeping active sounds like it will help you out massively, so I really hope that you can continue and there really is no reason why you should not - just don;t tire yourself out too much! Loads of luck with everything - you'll be fine :)) xxx      ",

The nurse gave me these silicone foam pads to put over the top to stop any infection, but they keep ripping the skin open, which is grim :( i know this is normal and she did say it would get worse.......but urgh what a hideous thought. My crusty nipple is also peeling away too, but at least that is the not broken and sore.  Has anyone else had these problems? I am now 'airing' my boob, as i think this will help it sort itself out, instead of wearing the pads all the time...i really don't want the wound to keep re-opening everytime I have to take it off... any other advice on what i should do, but i am guessing grinning and bearing it is the only option!!! xx",

Glad the hair is doing well - mine is growing soooo much now  - obviously, it is still short, but some days i go out and all my new growth is sticking up through the longer hairs, it's hilarious!! uncontrollable!! my hair has gone quite wavy, which at first i thought was cool, but now I am not too sure...so i have been using my straighteners trying to tame it, although all my friends have been telling me off! i did use a hairdryer once, but the outcome was absolutely hilarious and i went about all day with some horrific bouffant with sticky up hair and spiky regrowth!!!! i have no idea when it is ok to start using all those products again, i had my hair cut once to get rid of 'the bush' mullet that had formed where the patchy hair loss was, but am now trying to last until after my holiday as i have a wedding and want it to look really fab and nicely styled for that! I finished chemo about 12-13 weeks ago now, but only got the straighteners out in desperation about 2 weeks ago. i've been using some serum and other products as well, but they are quite heavy on my hair.   my advice is do it and see how you get on!! but be kind to those nice new hairs! ps, still got the monkey hairy face, i bet i am the only one this bloody happens to!!! typical  xxxx    ",

Thought I'd mention it, as I am going to try this as well - although I only have 1 more chemo left, I have just started getting this weird feeling like I am in a lift or on a boat, kind of like my ears are blocked - very weird!! keep taking the pills they gave you anyway and I hope you are feeling bit better soon    take care :) x  ",
