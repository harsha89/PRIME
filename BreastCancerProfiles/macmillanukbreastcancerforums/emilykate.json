    "Content": "Hi TinyTears71, Thought I would share my throat issues with you. I was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Also spread to lymph nodes. I had a mastectomy and then 5 years on Tamoxifen. I was cancer free until November 2006 when the cancer returned with spread to lungs. Since then I have had many treatments but of interest to you is that during 2011 I developed a very hoarse voice which simply did not respond to any treatment including voice physiotherapy. I finished with Tamoxifen in 1999 but it was 12 years later before I had the voice problem. I was never offered any explanation as to the cause of this, although vague references were made to to the possibility it could be cancer related. I eventually had a Thyroplasty Procedure which means my voice has improved, but it is by no means perfect. Related or not! Coincidence? I do believe though that an appointment with ENT specialist might provide some resolve for you. Also, I had no pain or discomfort, but it was very tiring speaking for any length of time. Please do contact me if I can provide any further info. Look after yourself, EmilykateÂ ",
