      "Content": "Hi.. I know how u feel.. I'm only 36 n. I was diagnose IDC and I have 4cm lump which is huge.. And clear SLN, and I started my chemo FEC Last 31 of jan. .. Today is my 10 day and feel Little better and fighting!!! I think this logic of treatment Is called neo adjuvant if I'm not wrong.. At first I was so angry and I can't accept to go through chemo, surgery, radiotherapy but I guess they have experience and know what they r doing.. We just have to keep on believing that chemo is our friend and it will help us to go through this thing....even though having all this side effects we just have to fight it, try to eat proper food and get on.. I know it's hard but we have to think that we r strong!!! There are a lot of nice people in this forum and they r all willing to help and give advice u will see light us u go through and we have to think good and positive to ourselves.. If u see mc Milan office n ur hospital try to speak to someone there, they will answer and help u with ur questions.. I have encounter nice people there.. They will give u advice... Hope all goes well : )",
