I was diagnosed with TNC on 16 June and felt the need to get started immediately, but I had to have numerous tests & scans first.

Thank you to all you lovely sisters who have shared your journey and wisdom, I will sharing mine with you too, afterall Knowledge is Power!!!....obviously not too muh tho' xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies I was diagnosed triple negative 2 weeks ago. it didn't really mean that much to me, all I knew was that I had breast cancer and I was devastated. Having met with the registrar oncologist he explained it to me and also stressed that it responds well to chemo, that was something I needed to hear. I had a sentinal biopsy last week and am awaiting the results. I start chemo on 9th July. I am ready for battle. Dont get me wrong I'm no super hero and I know it's going to be the biggest fight of my life. But ever since I acccepted my diagnosis I wanted to get on and do something about it. I look forward to completing my treatment successfully and then hoping and praying it never returns. I'm so glad this site exists and that you wonderful women take the time to share your journeys and offer encouragement, keep well xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Denise Don't have any advice for you as you are a little ahead of me, but our treatment plans are similar in that I have just had my 3rd course of EC, one more to go. Then 4 treatments of Docetaxel.......like you not lookoing forward to it. Lumpectomy & radiotherapy to follow. Trying to stay strong & positive and be a Warrior Princess but as you and everyone else on this site knows it's bloody hard!! Anyway, I wish you well on your journey and hope you get some informative but not too terrifying responses, cos I'll be reading & trying not to run for the hills.....",

      "Content": "Lol - I have chemo brain and I haven't even started!! My scan is booked for 18 July but they are hoping to bring that forward. I went to my dentist on TuesdayÂ  who advised me that she wanted to pull out a vunerable tooth, which I had done this morning. When I spoke to my BCN she told me that I also needed a bone scan before my chemo & that they would also have to check to ensure my gum had healed well, So I have 3 factors impacting on my start date which I have little or no control over. So I have decided to let go and go with the flow! I only decided on this less than 24hrs ago and already I feel so much lighter! I'm glad you've had such a positive experience it makes it so much more bearable. Having those ladies to talk to as well is just great! Keep well & I look forward to catching up soon xx",
