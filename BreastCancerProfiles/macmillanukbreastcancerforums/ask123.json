I think he is probably very scared, and would rather hide underneath a blanket rather than facing what is to come.  Sending you hugs, hang in there xxxx ",

I don't think people really understand what you are going through, and probably by saying that you look well and that it's all nearly back to normal, they think they are being supportive.  But it all comes across as being unrealistic and insincere.  Before being struck by cancer, I don't think I could empathise myself.  I have had a mastectomy 3 weeks ago and I was telling my sister yesterday that I was surprised that I came out of surgery feeling relieved and quite unscathed by the experience, and she commented 'Well, people have implants for 'cosmetic' reasons'.  I didn't think much of it at the time, but only afterwards did it really start to sink it.  I have only been diagnosed in December, and have a long journey ahead, with my first round of chemo next Friday.  But all I can say, those who have really been there for me, are those I expected the least.  But everyone does try to help in the best way they can.  Stay true to your colours.  Let them shine - we like that!!!  Hope you like the lyrics. https://www.bing.com/search?q=true+colours,+cindy+lauper&form=IE11TR&src=IE11TR&pc=EUPP_DCJB 4:07 · HD You with the sad eyes Don't be discouraged Oh I realize Its hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all And the darkness inside you Can make you feel so small But I see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow",
