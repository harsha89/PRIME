      "Content": "I have finished all my treatment, which included chemo and radio theraphy, my last RT was end of Janurary this year. Now through the whole process i have been quite positive and everyone has said to me how well I have handled it and what a strong person I have been, which I appIreciate, but now I feel like I just want to be left alone and I feel guilty, because I hear all these people who's had a serious illness that it changes the way you look at life etc. I don't at the moment feel like everything is so much better and live every day as if it was the last\\, and I'm just wondering wheter anyone else feels like this, or is it just Me?

      "Content": "Hi Margaret, Thanks it's been so nice to get replies from everyone, knowning I'm not alone with these feelings, does help a lot. I realize that I don't need to beat myself up, if I do have a bad day once in a while, but luckely I have more good days than bad, and after having a good chat with my husband too, I know I don't have to pretend to be ok, if I'm not and that it's ok to feel a bit down now and again. I hope you stay healthy, thank you and take care. Gitte.xxx  ",

      "Content": "Thank Jo, I often think I'm alone with these feelings, but guess it's quite normal not to be jumping up nad down all the time. Most of the times I am positive, which is who I am, but when I do feel down I'm not good at sharing it with anyone and keep it to myself. You're right it is difficult to explain how you feel, sometimes I don't even know how I feel, and because of that it's obviously difficult to try and explain people how you feel. Thank you, it's nice to know I'm not the only one feeling like this. x ",

      "Content": "Hi Max, sorry I haven't been online for quite a while. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. I am thankfully a lot better now, and I had a long talk with my husband, I didn't want him to think that I wasn't strong anymore, silly I know, and we talked about how I was feeling, well i talked and he listened :0), and telling him how I felt, made me feel a lot better. I don't have to be positive all the time, and I realise that now, it's ok to be down sometimes and feel a bit sorry for myself , because of what I have been through. Thanks again. Gitte. xx",

      "Content": "HI Clair, for me personal RT was a lot better than chemo, I started RT about 3 weeks after my last chemo, it was at the same hospital and all of the staff were brilliant, they had time to chat with you and have a laugh, and they tried their best to make you feel comfortable. I was tired, but think it was beacause of the daily journey, but saying that I'd take that any day over chemo. My tattoos are hardly visible, I forget I have them, and my skin has only change slightly in colour, so I'm really pleased with that. I did feel a slight soreness, but it feels a bit like a slight sunburn. I hope it all goes well for you and good luck. take care Gitte. xxx",
