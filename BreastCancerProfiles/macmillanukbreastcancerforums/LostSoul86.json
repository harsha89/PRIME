It means so much, its such a scary time for us all, and as much as we are reassured constantly that it\u2019s probably not cancerous it doesn\u2019t ease our thoughts at all. I really hope your appointment goes ok would be great if you could let me no how it goes, mine is 25th June.  Dose your lump feel hard? Mine dose which is what I\u2019m worried about but apparently the fact it  is slightly mobile means it\u2019s a good thing! Please try not to feel to down, at any time you need to talk I\u2019ll always be here. Funny enough I\u2019m finding writing here a lot easier than talking to my husband. Talking to my husband / family members only seems to make them sad and worry that little bit more.  Really was lovely to hear from you! Xx ",

      "Content": "I really hope someone can give me some advice! I found a lump about three weeks ago now, I left it for two weeks and then went to see my Gp. My Gp said although it dose feel like it could possibly be a tumor she thinks it\u2019s more than likely to be a cyst as it dose silighty move. I have to be honest to me it doesn\u2019t feel like it moves at all it\u2019s firm and oval shape. It\u2019s in my right breast and it\u2019s only slightly visible on the out side. It\u2019s not painful but thing is I get pain in my left breast ( I no strange ) has anyone had this type of lump that has been Breast cancer?  My Mum had BC at the young age off 36 and My Dads Mum had it at 38. I\u2019m 31 very nearly 32.  My Gp has urgently booked me in for a mammogram etc had appointment through and it\u2019s nearly 3 weeks. I\u2019m going nuts always trying to google BC and symptoms etc. Thank you! ",
