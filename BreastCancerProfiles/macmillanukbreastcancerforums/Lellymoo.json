    "Content": "Had surgery for breast cancer Friday 9th Have had my first shower today but think I have got dressings wet. Not due to be changed until 28th August when I see my surgeon. Still have my drains in. Not as much pain as I thought there would be but numb under left axila. Am afariad to get wet in case start bleeding or cause infection, but felt so much better after shower.
