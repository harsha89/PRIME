    "Content": "I don't like the Brave the Shave campaign either. I never have. I've just list my hair..For which I don't feel brave or sad ....its just part of the treatment I'm having to have.  I made a comment about this on a Facebook link that popped up....and had several replies suggesting that I was being a spoil sport. I did also suggest that any length of hsir should be donated to  a wig charity such as Little Princess...which I believe macmillan suggest and encourage the shavers to do.  I still don't like this campaign....I think the words should be reversed to Shave for the Brave too.",
