      "Content": "Hey smiffy2512 honestly the waiting part is the worse. I had to wait 2 weeks for my results in that time I only told close family. I was very sore for a few days after my biopsy. When I got my results I was in such a state but all went quickly from there. I then told my close friends & honestly it was the best thing I did as they have all been there for me to rant shout cry whatever. I told my oldest daughter which was soooo hard we cried ALOT but then I was like we will get thru this be a long journey but we will get there. Since then Ive met my oncologist key worker my chemo nurse sooo many wonderful ppl and the support u get on here is amazing. I've just had my 1st chemo session yesterday and I went and brought my wig today. I'm so sorry ur going thru this but honesty will get better once u know what's happening. I'd say still go on holiday relax have an amazing time xx",
