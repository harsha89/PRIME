      "Content": "Sue,   I know exactly how you feel, I was in the same boat when I was diagnosed in 2011 - you should have seen the look on the face of the anaesthetist when I admitted to smoking more than 20 a day! I took almost four months to give up and it was a combination of the chemo, a book and CD called Stop Smoking in One Hour by Susan Hepburn (available on Amazon) and Champix. I actually kept forgetting to take the tablets! I stopped smoking on March 16th a Friday night and had no cigarettes as a safety blanket! I haven't had a cigarette since - not that I haven't fancied one occasionally! You can only give up when you are ready. I never thought I would be able to give up the habit after trying more times than I care to think. Don't add to the enormous amount of stress because you feel guilty for smoking, take each day one at a time, you will give up when you're ready.   Hugs, Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Saraf You're entitled to have a bloody big wobble - I've had three this week! And I don't expect it to get any better until I get the results from the bone scan and CT scan done on Wednesday. I had my mastectomy on 8th Dec after being told all the biopsies were negative (DCIS). But was told at the 2week review that 11 of the 19 lymph nodes showed a positive result for cancer although there was none in the breast. So you have a wobble, everyone here will be thinking about you and sending great big hugs. ((((((((((())))))))) Sue, xxx",
