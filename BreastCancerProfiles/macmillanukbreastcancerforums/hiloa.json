      "Content": "Hi there, I have no experience of the drugs your mother is on I'm afraid but realise that it can be very distressing when someone is struggling to hold down any food.  Is it possible for her to ask for some different anti-nausea medication which may reduce her vomiting? Ginger can help to settle the stomach a little as can mint or fennel tea and keeping the fluid intake up is important. Have you let her doctor know about her failing appetite and see what they have to say?  Sorry I can't really help at all but it is always best to go back to her medical specialists and check any problems out with them. Kindest regards, Hiloa ",

      "Content": "Hello Disy, Excuse me popping into the BC group but I saw the title of your thread and was curious.  My husband who is a cancer patient has developed tachycardia and has had it for about 7 or 8 months now.  There are 3 different types of tachycardia and treatment is different depending on the type. H has sinus tachycardia (which his oncologist puts down to surgery and ongoing treatment as he has never had heart issues before and was very fit pre cancer)  and has been told that he is better without treatment for it.  He does very gentle exercise and his resting pulse is down from well over 120 to about 90 now.  It hasn't caused any problems other than leaving him extremely tired and we hope that it will gradually continue to improve.   He had a 24 hour heart monitor to diagnose what type of tachycardia he had.  I am glad your GP is speaking to someone with more experience of heart issues but if you remain concerned maybe you could ask to be referred to a specialist. I hope you get some answers and the condition improves, Hiloa x",

      "Content": "Hi MamaSm It can really help to have someone to share your cancer experience with and there may be someone who lives near to you and would be happy to meet. I think cancer can make you feel quite alone and it can be really helpful to try and get some support. But if not have you had a look at the \"In Your Area\" section of the site (near the top right of the screen)?  If you enter your post code and say what you are looking for (eg support groups) it will list some of what is available in your area. And meanwhile if you keep posting in the Breast Cancer group you will get some very good support from others who may not live near by but certainly understand.  Hiloa",

I think she was surprised to be given options rather than a treatment plan as she thought the experts would make the decisions and she knows that my husband is always given a plan with his treatment. Good point about local recurrence not mets - thanks. I will pass on your thoughts and then we will see what she decides after seeing the oncologist tomorrow. Thanks again for taking time to respond, it is really appreciated, Hiloa x",

      "Content": "Hello, I hope no-one minds me popping in to ask a couple of questions.   I have just had a phone call from my lovely sister (53) to tell me she has breast cancer that has spread to a couple of local lymph nodes but no-where else and will most likely start treatment this coming week.  She has seen the surgeon who said she had 3 options. 1. lumpectomy with a 8% chance of recurrence within 10 years, 2. Mastectomy with 2% chance of return in 10 years (both 1 and 2 would be followed by radiotherapy and chemo and 5 years hormone therapy) or 3. Start with chemo first (as it will make surgery easier and it is easier to see which kind of chemo is most effective for her).  I should mention she is in Australia (which is really tough because with my husband fighting bowel cancer I won't find it easy to go out there and help at all). I just wanted to ask which option any of you would consider the best to go for and also if there are any questions you can suggest she should ask the surgeon and the oncologist (who she is seeing tomorrow). Thank you so much for reading, I know very little about breast cancer - my learning starts today.... Hiloa  x",
