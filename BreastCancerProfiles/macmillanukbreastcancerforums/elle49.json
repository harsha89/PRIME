      "Content": "Hope you enjoy your holiday. We went away in our motor home so no  flying but the different bugs in a different part of the country gave me the chest infection. Sounds like you are planning for the worst and hoping for the best.  That is what I have been doing through surgery, chemo and now radiotherapy ( 1 session to go - hooray) and have escaped worst side effects of 4 cycles of TC chemo and rads.  I can quite understand your being keen to get away as I am looking forward to getting back to my old style of living now. Wishing you all the best Elle",

      "Content": "Big risk is catching infection on flight as immune system is not so good. I went away after last chemo and before radiotherapy and caught chest infection and needed anti biotics from GP. Maybe your GP would give you some to Take away with you. Also think Boots have nasal spray that may help to avoid catching anything on plane. You probably already have hand wipes etc. Hope you enjoy your break. Elle",
