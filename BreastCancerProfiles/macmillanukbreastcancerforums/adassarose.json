Anyway I now have a pain just below my right shoulder blade which is annoying and makes it uncomfortable to sleep on my right side. It is no where near my operation site so I am unsure as to what could be causing this.",

If I am honest keeping myself busy is a welcome distraction from my illness, it still feels a bit surreal as I don't feel or look \"unwell\".  I have booked next week off, just to recharge my batteries. I don't have my outpatients appointment until mid December, in the meantime I have an education day and a pampering event to look forward to.",

I feel better than I thought I would, that's probably why it feels so unreal.  I feel a little tired but I think that is the combination of the treatment and travelling to the the hospital everyday for three weeks.   Getting your cancer diagnosis certainly does give you a new perspective on life to value those things that are important like family and good friends.",

I am definitely having radiotherapy and hormone therapy, the outcome of the test will determine whether I have chemo as well, but I hoping it does not come to that given the side effects. I hope all goes well with you too.",
