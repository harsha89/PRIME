    "Content": "Hi everyone, I just joined this group today. My 83 year old mother is in the middle of her 2nd of  a 4 course treatment of  Capecitabine & Lapatinib. She had a single mastectomy 18 months ago and lymph node removal followed by chemo and radio therapy then herceptin but the cancer spread to a bone area which was zapped by radiotherapy and now on this latest treatment as has some spots on her lung. She's very tired and seems depressed, nothing tastes right, sore mouth etc. Does anyone have experience of this, is it worth it in the long term as she says her quality of life has gone Any advice welcome on life expectancy with/without the treatment. Thanks in advance",
