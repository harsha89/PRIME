My oncologist didn't even mention cold cap I had to ask, was told it would delay start of chemo as only so many caps available and success about 60%. The thought of loosing my hair has been very hard for me  I don't like much about myself but l love my hair, I've decided to embrace my baldness. My reasons are I don't want any treatment delayed we do enough waiting anyway and just want to get it done and my life back, I don't want to spend any more time at the hospital than necessary, I seem to spend my life there now, I'm not sure I'd tolerate it and no guarantee I will keep.my hair. We have a wedding to go to later in the year and my husband is already bald so maybe he will wear the wig and I will go bald for the wedding to make a change! X",

      "Content": "Hi, I am Her2+ hormone-, I had Fec-T chemo last year and I'm still having the herceptin until June. I can only share my experience with suggestions that may make life easier for you. I had 3 Fec followed by 3 T. I didn't start the herceptin until I started the T part of the chemo. You should be given steroids to take and anti sickness, I wasn't given mine until I turned up for the 1st chemo, if the anti sickness don't work for you then ask for a different sort. You should have an echocardiogram before the herceptin starts and one every 3 months until the herceptin is finished. I chose not to use the cold cap, this makes the session a lot longer and I didn't want that but I'm sure someone who used it can tell you what it's like.I took an i-pad to keep me occupied during chemo sessions. You will need a thermometer and to take your temperature daily, I also kept an overnight back packed in case I had a raised temperature and had to go to hospital. Some people sail through the chemo with little or no problems, some people have problems with one or the other or both, I have to be honest, I was unlucky and felt bad with both whereas my friends mum on same regime sailed through with no problems.  It is all very doable and before you know it your chemo will be finished. I don't know if you have a big c centre near you, I am lucky with that as my hospital is Norwich which has a big c centre on site, but a big c centre is well worth a visit, it was there they told me about free prescriptions for 5 years (I'm 48) they also have a look good feel better workshop which I found wonderful. Hope this helps you.  X",

I was straight on with the excersises they are quite hard initially but important that you stick with it. 5 weeks post surgery I have almost normal movement back in my arm still bit sore at times but nothing to bad.

This is the third and last time my dog gets the kennel cough done, its squirted up her nose and she gets very stressed by it, she never goes into kennels as my brother moves in and looks after when we go away so I will not be putting her through kennel cough vaccine again.

You should also have an echocardiogram before they start the herceptin. I had a picc line fitted,it made the chemo so much easier, if they offer you one personally I think it's worth it. I would also say get yourself a decent thermometer as you will need to take your temperature every day throughout the chemo, you will be more vulnerable to infection so thermometer is vital for early warning sign. I would also suggest a bag with stuff to keep you amused during the chemo books, tablets etc. As for work I worked reduced hours after the opp but when I started the chemo I didn't work at all, it depends on how you  feel with it, it affects us all differently,  not gonna lie for me the chemo was tough and I ended up with couple of infections, but I did it and I'm out the other side, my friends mum had exactly the same chemo and she sailed thro without any bother.

Ginger biscuits, ginger beer and you can also get sweets called gingins which are string ginger flavour are ment to be good, I like ginger but found the strong flavour to much as I tend to get mouth ulcers.

Thought this wouldn't be to bad, I have a friend who's mum has just gone thro exactly the same treatment and sailed thro. Since my 1st docetaxel I have been in hospital 3 times once with neutrophinic sepsis and twice with cellulitis in the affected breast, I rattle with the amount of antibiotics ive had along with the iv antibiotics some given while admitted to hospital others daily visits to be hooked up on a drip. My last docetaxel was reduced by 30% and today's will be the same. Not worried about chemo today thrilled it's my last 1, little bit concerned that it triggers another infection but hay ho if it does it does we are well rehearsed in the signs to look for and what to do about it. Radiotherapy now been put back a couple of weeks but expected it so all good. At the end of the day we are all different some of us will sail thro, some of us will have problems along the way, but it is achievable and we will all get thro the treatment.

I'm just thankful I found the lump and acted upon it.  Since my diagnosis I encourage my friends and family to check themselves as for some of us waiting for the routine mammogram is to late. X",

      "Content": "Hi Maz73, I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma with a high grade DCIS, I was also told after surgery the node they removed was positive (macro metastasis) is what the lab report said, I went into immediate panic thinking the metastatic part ment I had secondary cancer.  I had further surgery for a node clearance which all came back as negative, I was also told the nodes had done their job and and caught the cancer before it spread to the rest of my body. I also had more margin on the second opp which was also clear, no signs of any cancer on the second surgery. I still needed chemo as mine was a Grade 3 which is an aggressive form. Is it the stage or the grade that is 3 for you? My stage was 2 even though it was in 1 node.  I was Er neg and her2 +. My diagnosis was Jan2016 I'm now back at work and enjoying life, before you know it the treatment will be behind you.  We are all stronger than we think we are, until faced with the challenge of our lives, then we see how strong we really are. Hope this helps and good luck with your treatment. X",

I would also have an overnight bag ready while on the chemo, just in case you have to go in with a high temperature. I'm not gonna lie chemo can be tough, we all react to it differently, it is also very doable. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi CEC It's all very scary to start with, we all have our ups and downs. I ended up having 2 opps 1st one lumpectomy and 1 sentinel lymph node removal, had to go back for 2nd opp as lymph node was positive and not enough clear margin on the breast tissue, this sent me into complete panic and meltdown. As it turned out everything taken on 2nd opp was clear so my meltdown turned out to be all for nothing. There are many ups and downs on this journey but we learn to cope. I'm now 2 chemo done with 4 more to go. I would try talking to your daughter again as I have found families support invaluable, I also think you may need help with you animals for some of the time, do you have friends who can help? I found staying away from dr Google helpful, this forum is by far the best for help and support. I also found keeping my mind occupied at quiet times by doing jigsaw puzzles helped me. Hugs xxxx",

I intend to apply the same principle during my chemo tho will have to be careful about infection, I am a carer so higher risk of infection tho I can do office work if I want and or the more able clients who are generally in good health so pose no more infection risk than going to see family or friends. From my point of view taking the next 6 months off which is what my oncologist suggested I do is not an option, while my company are great and supportive they don't pay sick pay and I can't live off ssp.
