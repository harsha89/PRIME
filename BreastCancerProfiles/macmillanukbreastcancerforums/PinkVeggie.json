      "Content": "Hi Mossum  I had 6xTch last year finishing in November - I found 1 overwhelming sick 2 new meds but exhausted had days when i thought i was dying 3 similar then my body seemed to cope better , maybe because i knew what to expect and had the right meds to deal with the side effects. At 3 I wanted no more ... but carried on after talking to some ladies with secondaries whilst I was in hospital ( neutropenic septis - that was a real joy !) when you get to three your half way there try and focus on that and just take it day by day - ask about dose reduction if you really are struggling but hang in there . Think all of us have been at the cant carry on point . Will think about you tomorrow and try to send some good  vibes your way ... Ann x",

      "Content": "Sons 27 and 25 both work away most of time , been up front since the dodgy mammogram sent me back for more tests , they know as soon as I know . I had to ring them to tell them cancer Dx and then the results from pathology , difficult calls tried to time to end of day. Both my parents had cancer and I hated being kept in the dark with one of them and not the full weight of what was happening with the second. Sons have told friends so they have support. It means this Dx is just another bit of normal (!) family life with them winding me up gently about being a baldy One son just diagnosed with Lyme disease so he's home currently and feeling sorry for himself ... Least he's not now expecting me to run around after himWe all have to do what's right for our families and the individuals within good luck Littlewombat with whatever you decide x",
