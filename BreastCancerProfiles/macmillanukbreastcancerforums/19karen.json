      "Content": "Hi hope someone can help my mum has finished her course of chemo and recently had her radio therapy she has a couple of herceptin treatments left, but has recently started having hot flushes and fainting attacks. She says the strange feeling she gets seems to come up the back of her neck into her head. The docs have checked blood pressure sitting and standing and seemed normal. Has anyone else experienced this. Xxx",
