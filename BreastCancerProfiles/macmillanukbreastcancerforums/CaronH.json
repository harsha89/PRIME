      "Content": "Sleep is the best thing if you can get away with  it!  Remember it is only temporary and it is important that you give yourself a break even if you are used to rushing around and being active! Try to do any 'jobs' when you can (i used to be good in the morning but exhausted by lunch so would get everything done early then put my feet up in the afternoon). Make good use of a slow cooker that just gets on with food while you sleep or make good use of friends who will cook for you!  ",

      "Content": "Hi guys! I had a RB mastectomy 2 years ago follwoing bc diagnosis.  I had FECT chemo and 25 doses of radiotherapy (Happy to help anyone with questions about either).  I've been waiting for reconstruction surgery and am now about to procede BUT have just had rubbish news that my sister has BC.  Am now worried about my cancer being more likely to return if there is a familial link and would like to have a LB mastectomy as preventative. Would love to hear from anyone in similar situation Caron",
