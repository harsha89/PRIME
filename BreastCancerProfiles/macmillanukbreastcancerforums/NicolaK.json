      "Content": "Hi Thanks for your response. I never thought that maybe it could be a reaction to the chemo possibly. It was to me the most horrendous 5 days I've experienced yet. I know everyone will have side effects and the tiredness I can deal with but my body shaking uncontrollably was just out of my hands. My partner said at one point it felt like o wasn't even in the room. I was in tears and really upset and couldn't calm myself down. The only time I calmed down was getting to bed as I exhausted myself with tears. I was doing exercises and going out short walks to help. My partner even took me out in car to get out house as I felt trapped but as soon as got home couldn't settle. I know you don't just sail through this but hope they can help with this as I just want to make it to the end but right now my positivity is away and I'm dreading the next treatment already and that's not like me.",

      "Content": "Hi I had my 3rd chemo session last Wednesday. From Saturday to Monday I had real issues with restless legs and shakey body. It was so bad that I could not control my body and felt so trapped. I ended up in tears all weekend and kept saying to my partner I can't do this anymore. I spoke to my BCN and she told me the steroids are playing a part in this. It really has knocked me for six coz I was feeling really positive about it all and now just feel really low and now on a bit of a downer and since my diagnosis and operations I've not cried since and now I'm an emotional wreck. Is this normal to feel like this? My advice fromBCN is to tell the doctor what's been going on and hopefully they can change the dosage or whatever. Thanks Nic",

      "Content": "Hi Julia Thanks for your response.Â  Yeah I'm due to see oncologist dept on the 29th December so will need to tell them how I've been. The tiredness has been a funny one for me as I slept as normal during night but after the 2nd insomnia kicked in so I'm on a very light dose of sleeping tablets and this time I'm back to sleeping but still with the aid of tsblets. This time was just horrendous so I really hope they can help and chance some of the dosages as I know people will be like just get on with it but for three days solid my whole body was shaking and partner told me at one point he felt like I wasn't even in the room. I was going to bed in tears aNd now I dread the next one so really hope oncologist can help me as I want to get back to feeling positive about getting to the end. Nic xx",
