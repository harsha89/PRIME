I wear a kitchen glove for chopping vegs.   I subsequently had Cellulitis for months ( Antibiotics sorted it out eventually),in WLE breast followed by mild  Lymphoedema in WLE breast. I have my next check up with Lymphoedema Nurse next Sat.  I have been on Anastrozole since Dec 6th 2013, changed to Arimidex April 2015. I haven't slept well since starting these tabs. After travelling to & fro work all I want to do is crash out on the sofa :-/  Enjoy the sun it's good for our bones :-) Judith xxx ",

The Oncologist did not organise a DEXA Bone scan before I commenced Radiotherapy and so I was told by a nurse clinician at the hospital that I had to request the bone density scan via my GP which I did. I think it varies where you live in the country . So my Rads ended Feb 12 2014 and had the bone scan in May 2014. A reminder for a follow up is in my phone calendar for March 2015. I have an appointment with Onc October 24th and will request whether I can go on Arimidex as insomnia and depression really hard. It's like having PMT all the time. I saw a Lymphoedema Consultant today and he thought it might be useful to try it also. I hope you feel better and can find a medication to help you too! Love Judithx x",

      "Content": "Hi Rosalyn, Good question! I'd just commented on this very topic just now to one of G'J's posts. Please see my profile and latest activity for that post. I was told by a nurse clinician that I had to request that test via my GP. The first GP I saw ( not my usual named GP) said why do you want that, I replied because my Oncologist had recommended it. So I did not hear anything for a while, contacted the surgery and found out that some mistake had occured at the practice & the request had not been placed/ got lost in the system. Then I saw my regular GP who chased it up. The scan was done at a private clinic as part of NHS partnership. So I had Radiotherapy 2014: Jan 22nd- Feb 12 , began Anastrozole & Adcal Dec 2013, had Base Density Scan May 2014. I have placed a reminder for a follow up in my calendar for March 2015. The result I had in May, read by my regular GP ( a diamond) shows that I'm heading towards Osteoporosis. So my recommendation would be start tel/ texting/emailing Breast Care Nurse, Oncology Dept, GP and find out who's organising this scan? I think it could vary from place to place. Wish you well.

      "Content": "Hello Keeker & Roslyn, Just read your post Keeker and can relate to what you write. When I had BASE bone scan at private clinic I was told when I asked about the results that the GP would receive a report, but not the Oncology Dept. I requested a photocopy from GP & passed it to Onc Dept for my file. Not sure where it went after that :-) My GP is interested in my treatment and has added me to her priority patient care list. The first time I heard of a BASE bone density scan was when one of the Radiologists mentioned it to me at the initial Radiography Planning meeting. He said you will get one. After that I heard nothing, the Radiologist did not say to me: you have to organise it via your GP. It would have helped if I had been given a Care Treatment Plan of what would happen, & who organises what, but I did not receive one. That's why it's important to keep very clear communications with everyone & get as much as possible in writing I feel. Regards Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Susie, A big welcome to you! Are you getting support with the Lymphoedema, do you have MLD? I had a WLE Nov 2013, 4 clear Lymph Nodes removed and then Radiotherapy: which finished Feb 2014. Since then I've had 2-3 bouts of Cellulitis in the breast operated on. Then in October 2014, had an official diagnosis with Professor Mortimer ( Lymphoedema Consultant) one of 2 in England, saw Professor Mortimer at his clinic at  The Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton for an initial consultation & diagnosis. Then I saw Mary Woods Senior Lymphoedema Nurse at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea. I requested a referral to Professor Mortimer via my GP who faxed the request to his secretary. Though depending on where you live,a  referral may need to come from the Oncologist. Professor Mortimer has an interest in secondary Lymphoedema as a result of breast cancer treatment. The details for Lymphoedema Consultants in the UK and elsewhere can be found at the Lymphoedema  Support Network: www.lymphoedema.org  I have paid my subscription and receive regular information. Also I have a medical alert card as part of my membership with the LSN. I am now taking Penicillin as a prophylactic ( low dose) for a year at least. So far the Cellulitis has kept away! It is a good idea too to wear a good support bra. I did not for a long time as this was not pointed out to me by the BC Nurse/ BC Team etc.Professor Mortimer recommended a sports bra & non wired. So I bought the Marks & Spencer 2 pack, one black, one white it comes in a wide range of sizes. I see a local Lymphoedema nurse who's paid by the local health trust to provide MLD to patients with Lymphoedema following treatment for breast cancer. I try to do regular exercise, but not wear myself out, I ache in the scar area and under arm pit area if I'm over tired. Keep the area clean & well moisturised with E45 cream regularly, don't use a disposable razor there and avoid carrying heavy loads on that side of your body. Also avoid extremes of temp eg too hot baths etc &  avoid midge bites,   cuts, scratches or grazes ( I carry Savlon with me everywhere). Apologies if you know most of this already! I feel it is better to have too much information & detail rather than too little. I wish you well. Hugs to you! Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Julia, I joined the LSN as was officially diagnosed by Professor Mortimer  with Lymphoedema ( with Cellulitis) in October 2014. Previous to that probably since the WLE, & 4 Lymph. Nodes removal on November 2013, I had bouts of Cellulitis which required courses of Antibiotics. Recommendations for Antibiotics are at www.lymphoedema.org. I was also advised by the Oncologist and Profesdor Mortimer to see the local ( NHS funded) Lymphoedema practitioner or nurse( details for registered ones on LSN). I received the care sheets free as I had taken out a membership of the LSN. The Radiated area, without complications  can take up to 18 months to settle down I was told. Cellulitis can develope into Lymphoedema which is why it's important to monitor any changes in the area. For Cellulitis that would be heat, pink or redness, pain and swelling. I have Lymphoedema in the breast area. Lymphoedema is a condition which can develop at any point, and affects approximately a quarter of people who have breast cancer surgery/treatment. It also affects people who undergo other types of surgery and treatment too.   Heat ( extremes of temperature are not helpful for Lymphoedema), it is advisable to drink lots of fluid and keep the affected area out of the sun. Also to avoid skin breakage or damage on the affected quadrant of the body ( where the Lymph channels try to flow). I believe that Tenerife does not have Mosquitos, trying to find a positive here;-)  As Helen says, if in doubt check it out!!  My GP was excellent and first diagnosed the Cellulitis in 2013.

      "Content": "Hi Amy 66, Regarding Radiotherapy have you been offered a DEXA Scan to measure your bone density ?  Will you be taking tablets ( AI's) to remove Oestrogen? I had  Rads Jan- Feb 2014.  Before they started I had 2 tattoos for the Radiologists to line up the beam. They are in blue ink and look like biro smudges, especially the one near my WLE breast. Not minute, suppose it depends on skill of tattooist.  The Rads do not hurt, it can take time to get the body lined up for the treatment. The Radiologists who treated me in Brighton Hospital were all  very kind and patient. I was advised to put E 45 cream on my treated area twice a day, which I did for 6 months. After treatment finished I felt   really tired for about 6 weeks. I think Rads : 1& 2 creams are available in some areas.  The after effects of WLE & Rads took about 18 months to settle down. I developed Cellulitis a bacterial infection  ( poss from surgery) and was  on antibiotics a number of months, then developed Lymphoedema in op breast which again settled down following Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) with a Lymphoedema nurse,via NHS ( referred by the Oncologist ).    I do have some Radiotherapy damage to chest wall, inflammation called Tieze's syndrome which means that the breast feels like it has a deep bruise all the time. ( I also had 10 titanium markers left post op in the breast for the Radiologists,  I was told a year later  by a doctor examining an X-ray with me)  Remember to drink lots of fluid and take books or music to listen to while waiting for the Rads room.

      "Content": "Hello, Keep an eye on the area, if it gets worse e.g. Redness/ pinkness increases, gets warm/hot to touch  and more painful, and swollen, & temperature,    then there may be an infection called Cellulitis, which will require a course of antibiotics. Untreated Cellulitis can result in  A&E. Foliowing a Lumpectomy, 4 Lymph Nodes removed and Radiotherapy I developed Cellulitis ( spotted by my GP), followed by Lymphoedema.  It took a few months of antibiotics followed by massage with a Lymphoedeman Practitioner  ( NHS). Eventually the area settled down, it was in the operated breast only.  Get it checked if you are not sure. Judith xx",

I started Anastrozole in Dec 2013 then went onto Arimidex ( initially for 5 yrs, now 10 yrs). I am 60 yrs work full time, live alone ( well have a rescue house cat >^\u2022\u2022^<. ),I cannot afford to retire. Following a week's commute to London all I want to do is rest.  Since 2012, I've had a relationship break up, both parents died, diagnosis of breast cancer,  plus an eye op!! The joys of old age eh?!?.  I also take 60 mg daily of Duloxetine ( Cymbaltum) anti -depressant for reasons, see above. I was reading about the side effects of this anti depressant yesterday and exhaustion can be one of them. I am going to reduce and gradually stop taking them. I don't like taking the Arimidex either,  but my Oncologist has persuaded me to keep taking it.  You seem to be doing all the right things. I saw a fitness trainer who works with older people, on Sat. I was unaware that the older you get there, is muscle loss. So I'm going to do some gentle ( esp on weak side) weight lifting. She also knows someone who has had bc who is now a nutritionist so that may help too. I would like to get advice about my requirements as probably lacking some Vit or minerals?   Sleep is very important too, I'm still working on that one and a social life :-) Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy, Agreed with all you wrote. I don't want to have to think of cancer returning at some point in the future. I am currently taking the prescribed medication post treatment with reluctance. Some days I can feel rage returning at the seeming randomness of it all. But would I have felt better if a test had told me with some accuracy that I was likely to develop cancer in a given time span? No. It is random, so being afraid constantly will not make any difference, just result in further stress and lack of sleep. In my case anyway. I worry about Lymphoedema spreading all down my arm and hand, which could happen, so every scar ache, or change in sensation I picture it happening... Really,  what my rational self says is we must try to look after ourselves,  but not obsess as it won't help with recovery. But in the early hours easier said than done. I wonder if this shock could be a likened to PTSD or is this too dramatic to say? I find that music and stupid comedy helps as laughing can counteract gloomy thoughts. Wish you well. Love Judith xx    ",

      "Content": "Hi ChloeCat45, Thank you for your excellent answers I really appreciate so much useful and interesting information!!! My understanding is that Arimidex is the Registered original drug and possibly has less unhealthy inactive fillers in it, than the much cheaper generic Anastrozole : but this could be wishful thinking on my part? I'm on Anastrozole Accord at present & can detect further aches & pains on the right side (op side), of body. I am right handed so maybe this makes sense in terms of wear & tear!  I bought Optibac Probiotics yesterday. Hoping it will help my immune system ( taking 500mg penicillin each day).  I noticed on the inside leaflet there's an Optibac product for those on daily antibiotics I shall seek this out as the everyday one was only available at the supermarket. Do you recommend any type of Green Tea? I bought Twinnings Simply Sencha Green  Tea pyramids. Not sure of difference between Sencha & Matcha? Some of the Green Teas are in powder form? I went for a whole leaf, Twinnings says steam dried instead of pan dried, again not sure which is better  medicinally?  I bought a stainless steel fit in pan steamer yesterday but now need a new saucepan as the steamer is 28cm & my pan is too small :-D.  I eat sweet potatoes as prefer the taste, and get carbs from oat cakes and Finn Crisp crisp bread : also the naughtiees: choc & Marmite Crisps :-) ! I am  taking Floradix   tablets which contain iron,  Vits B1,B2, niacin, B6, B12, C, folic acid, & herbal extracts.  Thank you again for such good advice :-) Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Chloe Cat 45, Thank you for this list which is very comprehensive and interesting! Thank you for listing all the different items! I was going to ask which brand of Anastrozole you are taking, then read back through some of the older  posts and saw TEVA.  I wondered if you had ever taken Arimidex ( Astra Zeneca) & if so how you found Anastrozole & Arimidex compare? I was taking Anastrozole Sandoz and have recently taken a month's emergency supply of Arimidex as the local Pharmacy had run out of Anastrozole. When I contacted the consultant via email for a prescription for Arimidex he left a voicemail to say that I should approach my GP for a prescription. This was a week ago. She had referred me to him for a prescription 2 weeks ago. I realise that Arimidex is far more costly and this is the reason why the consultant will not fax across a script to my GP. This is the second occasion that my GP referred me to the consultant as the expert in the field. I am now taking Accord as the choice at the Pharmacy was TEVA or Accord and I did not know which to take. In view of your previous comments re Accord it will be interesting to see how it affects me.  I do not take any extra multi Vits/ mins at present. I am putting Turmeric powder and black pepper over evening meal as a nutritionist recommended this at a Say Yes to Life talk I attended a year ago. I wish all the supplements you are taking came in one massive pill :-)  I'm considering drinking green tea again, but don't like it. I drink  1-2 cups of  flat white :coffee per day.  Rest : Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice Herbal Tea.  Do you have any views please  on \"Bio-Kult \"which contains 14 live bacterial cultures? Also \"Beta Glucan \" by Viridian? I'm taking penicillin each day as a Prophalatic ( avoid reoccurrence of cellulitis),  and feel nauseous each morning as a result. Also gives me diarrhoea sometimes. I realise that taking food supplements/ Vits/ mins/ is a very individual thing. I want to try to assist my health as much as possible.( Though I don't drink enough water :-/.) Might add I don't eat meat at all, avoid bread ( don't like it), drink little alcohol: now not with ex. Try to eat more eggs than in past. I love broccoli, carrots (cooked), fennel (raw), chicory/ endive (raw) rocket, avocados, nuts/ nut spreads, apples, blueberries poached salmon( M&S), tomatoes, lemons, oat cakes, cheese,  Tahini, olive oil. Weakness for chocolate :-/  ? Tell myself it's giving me iron :-[] Must admit  as I live on own, not keen on cooking at all, so vegs in the microwave with some fish/ cheese or nut spread does me fine. After work all I want to do is rest. ! Thank you for reading this far .... Judith xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Ally70, Welcome to the forum, good to have you on board! I agree it is important not to risk any cuts or scratches which may happen with disposable razors. My Breast Care Nurse  also advised using an electric or battery shaver. However, I would be wary however of using Veet as it may contain chemicals which could cause reactions in sensitive skin that is undergoing Chemo or Rads. I had a WLE 4 LNs removed followed by Radiography. I washed the pits using mild soap. Did not start with a deodorant until completed Rads, then used a Green People Roll on deodorant : Aloe Vera ( which has no harsh chemicals eg Aluminium and Parabens). Some believe that an accumulation of such chemicals in the Lymph glands is very unhealthy, and possibly tumour forming; though others dispute these findings.  After Radiotherapy I prefer to be a bit cautious with what I stick under my arm pits now. :-)  Love Judithxx",

Any suggestions please ? I would really appreciate it, sitting here with streaming nose. I have problems sleeping too. I eat broccoli practically every day!

The irony is that I had come off them completely at stage of diagnosis, but I was so shocked & angry that I asked to go back on them. My dad (90yrs) died 3 years ago and my ex split up with me, then I was diagnosed with BC. I have a 90yr old mum who lives in the country and does not know I've had breast cancer, as she deals with shock badly: emotionally collapses. I work full time and that keeps me going, and my mind occupied . Due to life events I don't have a family or relatives ( my parents both had difficult upbringings).  I live alone and find it hard. I am socialising, but it's a fine line between that and seeming \"desperate \"for company! Which let's face it is not attractive generally.  I think that if Anti depressants will support you relax, and get more sleep (do not work for me there :-( ) it's something to look into definitely.  Wish you well. e hug Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kate,  I had a WLE & 4 LNs removed in Nov 2013, followed by Rads Jan-Feb 2014. Since then I have had cellulitis, lots of anti biotics,  4-5 UTIs and mild Lymphoedema in the WLE operated breast!  I am 58yrs on Arimidex Astra Zeneca, Adcal VitD3, Citalopram 20 mg daily, Penicillin VK 500 mg daily ( to prevent reoccurrence of cellulitis,). I feel tired 70% of the time now. I commute daily from Brighton to London 4 days per week, & work from home on Fridays. I live alone, only 90yrs mum who lives in Wales. So every break visit her as no siblings.  I worry that the Lymphoedema will spread down my arm, but this is not an emotionally healthy way to live; so apart from sensible precautions to the op side quadrant of the body eg kitchen gloves for peeling vegetables and cleaning out the bath/ washing up- Also try to avoid cuts/ sunburn/scratches/ hot water/ harsh chemicals/bumps/burns/bites etc that is all I can do to prevent further infection.  Each day,  I have aching joints especially my back, and arm/ wrist on right side( right handed). I take Bio-Kult Pro-Cyan Pro Biotic from  Boots to help my gut ( penicillin each day). Also take Floradix Tablets to provide iron & Vits B& C. I am thinking about Glucosamine & Chondroitin and Magnesium.I try to eat healthily ( but too much chocolate if I'm honest .)  I find it difficult to relax and sleep well at night, though I think a pair of rescue Siamese cats would probably help !☺️ I saw a  Lymphoedema consultant last October who recommended wearing a sports bra, and not underwired ever again. My skin is sensitive following radiation, so even a soft bra feels rough.   Why should you have to \" grin & bear it\" feeling rough? Do you see a counsellor at all? I am seeing one at present for CBT, and find it useful. You are not alone Kate!! Keeping active is a good strategy. I did the recommended exrecises 2x daily for months- and did not get cording. I do them still but not so often.  Also walking helps when I feel irritable too. Look after yourself. Love from Judith xxx ",

Luckily, I have not had cording & try to keep my arms flexible to avoid this. I find it really hard to relax & often have insomnia and consider the Arimidex medication a factor in this.My thoughts sometimes go round in circles from redundancy to secondaries!  More so when I'm exhausted.  Sending you a virtual hug.

I agree with JMWatson it is important to speak to someone. I am waiting for further counselling: CBT, NHS funded so there is a waiting list. Maybe if you ring the Macmillan Helpline and see what's in your local area. Also do insist that you get a BC Nurse via the hospital or clinic you visited, if that's local to you.I saw two before found present BC Nurse who is kind and listens, also reads & answers emails. I live alone so this makes a great difference to me. I hope that you get some support very soon. Love Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm sorry that you are feeling so low. You have been through such a lot and at a young age too. When I was diagnosed with BC last November 6th, I was so angry I wanted to murder people. Then I was in shock for a long while. I feel down a lot on Anastrozole, tired, have joint pain & I think it's affected my eyesight too. In that it's more blurry, I had a cataract operated on and an implant about 7 yrs ago. The other eye seems to have got worse ( have a cataract in left eye too) & needs an implant in the new year according to Optometrist. I make myself go for walks and exercise. Most of time I have no energy. I also have insomnia which is difficult as my mind will not shut off. I would suggest that you contact the hospital or clinic where you had treatment and request a Breast Care Nurse. Let the BC Team there know that you need some emotional support at this point. Also you could see if there's a Macmillan Counsellor in the clinic/ hospital. I saw a counsellor for three months. I attend a Breast Cancer Support group held once a month at local Breast Care Centre. Maybe ring Macmillan and see what services / provision is available where you live. Is there more than one GP at your practice? Could you see another one? You also don't need to pay for prescriptions any more if you've had cancer. Get the form from your Drs surgery. I hope that some of this helps. It is always hard with not enough sleep! I know this. Look after yourself. Love Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Andreecorky and all,  Since 2012, life has been \"difficult\".  So I tend to think \"Why\" too! My dad (90) died in Jan 2012, my ex decided that same year after losing a lot of weight  that he wanted to relive his youth, at the age of 52. I moved from London to Brighton in 2013. I was diagnosed with BC in November 2013, had a WLE, followed by complications. Now better.  May 2016, my mum (92) died suddenly ( DVT), which has completely floored me! I have no family at all now, (  no brothers, sisters nor children ), except a cousin ( my mum & her brother were both adopted ). My dad had a difficult upbringing and as a consequence, so did I.  I live alone,  though with a strong willed cat! I try to get out there and socialise but  it is bloody hard! Believe it or not a very good sense of humour is buried beneath all this current gloom.  The Arimidex ( 10yrs ), makes me feel tired and years older than 59.  I'm off work through depression ( pretty obvious) have  just started counselling with CRUSE. I contacted the new Macmillan Horizon Cancer Centre in Brighton to see if they offer a \" Moving on \" course, they don't ! .So I am going to suggest that it might be an idea to do so. I did not let my mum know I had cancer as I did not want to burden her and now she has died I keep thinking that cancer will return, which is not a way to live.  Judith x",

      "Content": "Hi Denise,  Read your post & agree with all you say. The News presents us with generally negative \" news\". ( apart from the occasional Royal Baby / politician photo op) !  When you have stress & insomnia ( snap !!!), it makes everything much more difficult to cope with. I finished treatment Feb 2014. I too worry that it will return : unannounced!  I had no noticeable symptoms in Nov 2013. Worry is hard to damp down:-/ I take 20mg of Citalopram daily, work full time & try to eat properly ( mostly) & get regular exercise ( usually)! I will not watch \"The c word\" as I know that I would find it depressing. I get enough of that already ;-) with work,  & politicians rambling on about their promises (!) to create a better,more just society..!!! Haah! I hope that I can do some good in my work with unemployed young people instead.   In terms of lack of sleep, I refuse to take sleeping tablets as on Arimidex, AdCal VitD, Citalopram, plus Magnesium,  Vit B, & Pro Biotics!! Enough. Stopped taking daily Penicillin VK to prevent recurrence of Cellulitis as had daily Diarrorhea also:-/  Saw Onc in April 2015, & he said recovery from WLE, 4 LNs  removal & Rads was still ongoing! ( did not know that it takes this long).  I'm going to start CBT ( via GP referral) later this month and hypnotherapy via Macmillan Pychological Therapies Counsellor referral as have average 4 hrs sleep. Not really slept well since diagnosis Nov 2013. Always poor sleeper, even worse now! I live alone since ex split up with me 2yrs ago. That's certainly hard to deal with! I miss his company not his moods. Hopefully getting a cat May 17th :-) ( also sponsoring a Staffie Cross via The Dogs' Trust too). I don't have family close by, only have mum 91y in Wales. I have joined 14 Meet Up Groups so there should be some upbeat people there ! Enjoy your family and friends & try not to dwell on what ifs .. Big hug Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lilianc, This is an interesting Post! I had a WLE in Nov 2013, & 4 clear Lymph Nodes removed. In Jan- Feb 2014 I had Radiotherapy.  Soon after I developed Cellulitis in the op breast & then Lymphoedema. I had a GP Referral to Prof Peter Mortimer at The Royal Marsden in Sutton and he prescribed VK Penicillin for a year initially ( Cellulitis got better before then). Lymphoedema in op  breast is under control.  Towards the end 2014, I developed a riash  of itchy red marks under my bra line around the area where I had Rads. I saw my GP & asked for a referral to a Dermatologist.  I saw a Dermatologist in Brighton County Hospiral she examined them & said they were age related !! I find this hard to believe as I don't have them anywhere else and I'm 59 not 89! Yesterday I noticed another spot which is red, itchy & sore on the bra line. What I would like to know is, what are these? Are they an after effect of Radiation Treatment? Or are they in the wart / verruca family?   I also have a deep pain in the WLE breast and saw the Breast  Care Team Head Consultant at Royal Sussex Hospital who said the pain was caused by Radiation damage to the chest wall which could be temp or permanent and is known as Tieze's syndrome.   The pain is there with any pressure eg my cat placing one paw on my breast!  I'm going to follow up the red spots with another GP.

      "Content": "Hello, This is an interesting topic of conversation. My mother died In May this year  and dad in 2012. I am also an only child and would have prefered to have had siblings. When I was diagnosed with breast  cancer in 2013 my ex  came with me to my early treatment sessions ( I think out of guilt). He is currently dating a girlfriend 24 yrs younger than himself.  He is reliving his youth.  I don't have children, I read a term recently for this growing trend :  \" social infertility\". I spent years going on blind dates:  The Guardian, Time Out, Classic FM,  started when I was 22yrs , , travel : I visited countries on my own hoping to meet \" the one\"en route. I spent a number of years also not actively looking and still nothing happened.   I taught English in Italy  for one year and guess what ...nothing.  My last holiday, before I got together with my ex ( I met on a speed date) & who didn't  want children,  was a week in Sweden and Gotland  on my own, no I did not meet anyone.. Through the years, I have tried indoor rock climbing, joined various evening classes, went to parties, BTCV project in Norway etc etc  all to no avail !  I went out briefly with a Norwegian, but he did not want commitment ( had a 15yr son lived with his ex ),  just talked about food all the time ( his ex was a chef, hell I even queued up for James Martin's autograph for him).  When he described my interest in vintage and antiques as \" old crap\" then I thought thats it, enough.  My mother who had been adopted, was shy, generally pessimistic,  and had no friends,  This had an impact on me, I also had an unsettled childhood as they moved a lot. Different schools etc.  However I consider myself a sociable person in essence.   I have joined Meet Up and hope to get a social circle through that. My close school friend lives 7 hrs & 30 mins away in Wales.  Other friends, people from the past now live in Canada and New Zealand. I visited New Zealand in the 1990s. People change, a few years back a \" friend\" I met  at college who eventually got the lifestyle she desired in Chiswick, spent a lot of  time telling me how unhappy her marriage was, but how she could not afford to divorce.  When I subsequently contacted her regarding my own break up she was too busy studying a Prue Leith Diploma course  to see me.  I agree, it is not easy when you are alone and older.  I've contacted someone on Street Life App who's organising a get together for people on their own at Christmas in my local area.  This will be my first Christmas with no family.  Judith xx. ",

Her precise words were:\u201d I recommend everyone over 50 takes them\u201d. This immediately put me off High blood cholesterol could be a genetic factor, my mum had raised blood cholesterol and she was skinny and lived to 92yrs. Diet and stress could be contributing factors too.  Many medical companies\u201d probably\u201d  encourage GPs and aligned staff to promote statins for profit ? Or am I being cynical There are side effects with statins as with most drugs.  I think you have to weigh up the pros and cons. I am on enough drugs as it is  already,  so unless I can see the benefits, I prefer to pass on them.  Judith xx",

I requested Arimidex from my Oncologist at a check up in October 2014. He informed me that I would be taking the medication for 10yrs instead of 5 yrs & stated  that I need to speak to my GP about a prescription for Arimidex. When I let her know this , she said that it was not her area of professional expertise and that it was up to the Oncologist to decide. My local Pharmacist ran out of Anastrozole just before Christmas and had one month's emergency supply of Arimidex ( Registered maker Astra Zeneca).  I took Arimidex over Christmas and noticed an improvement & less joint pain. So I sent an email to the Oncologist's secretary requesting a script for Arimidex and I stated that the GP had referred me back to him. The Oncogist left me a voicemail message saying that he did  not have an issue with me taking Arimidex rather than Anastrozole, and said that it was the GP who would make that decision.  I am currently taking Anastrozole Accord brand and the aching is spreading to my shoulders and back. I had a basic bone density scan last May ( as no one told me I had to organise it via my GP). The results showed that I am moving towards Osteo porosis.  I feel tired and fed up, very hard  to work full time on an average of 4.5 hours sleep per night.  I believe it is the inactive cheap fillers which cause the side effects, in. Anastrozole but I could be wrong here.  Judith xx",

My first occasion in hospital was in 1987 ( prolapsed disc) which necessitated two weeks traction & one week bed rest. I was initially in a corridor in a busy North London Hospital, & by day three ( had made it into a ward) was so tired and emotional that I readily took the sleeping tablets offered by the nurses. I am currently taking Anastrozole, Ad Cal, Citalopram & Co-Amoxiclav. I don't wish to become reliant or addicted to sleeping tablets. In fact I don't like taking Citalopram either, I took it when diagnosed with Breast Cancer last November as could not contend with my feelings of rage & aggression. Since my diagnosis I have tried to ease my over active mind by meditation & to an extent this has helped. I note that you are a Buddhist. The internet is a truly marvellous invention! :-) I have looked at your blog and am very impressed by your determination and positive outlook in life in general and your achievements. You have used your influence for good and to aid humanity. We need politicians with your standards today. You are an inspiring individual. I hope that your health remains stable & if I reach an advanced age ( my mother is 90y) & my father was 90y, so there is a fair possibility, then I may well take a sleeping pill if I still have insomnia! I wish you well, Regards Judith xx",

However, I had read some where that there may be an increased risk of endometrial cancer with Tamoxifen and stated this to the Oncogist as a reason for my reluctance to change. I had also been informed by a nurse at The Royal Marsden Hospital ( Fulham), that a study was being undertaken by the hospital as to why so many women were stopping taking Tamoxifen. I saw Professor Mortimer at the RMH who diagnosed Lymphoedema & Cellulitis in the breast I'd had the WLE . So I'm taking penicillin for a year to stop the Cellulitis from reoccuring in addition to Anastrozole and Adcal VitD3.  I feel worried about the side effects associated with Tamoxifen, as it is an older drug and I can't face anything worse than I'm taking already.  I really don't know what to do apart from hassle my GP and see if she will write a script for Arimidex. ( Astra Zeneca).  The Oncologist said that if I took Tamoxifen then I could also take a topical oestrogen cream as the risk with this is very low. But I just feel worried and stressed as these AIs are supposed to be stripping the body of oestrogen so this  seems counter productive? Judithxx",

So getting nearer to an anniversary I 'd rather not remember too. My ex was there for me whilst I had my operation in hospital ( although he was texting his girlfriend just as I was due in theatre). I had been supporting him financially so his obvious reason for being there was not entirely altruistic. He came to my initial Radiotherapy treatment session because I was scared, I attended all the subsequent ones on my own. The TV advert is probably hard for many people to see, because it means different responses for individuals. The popular image is of a loving family and support group of friends flocking around, that is not the case for a great number of people unfortunately! Also many people with a support network can still feel very isolated as you pointed out in your email. The knowledge that you had that inner strength to go through that treatment will never leave you. It is brilliant to know that Macmillan is here for everyone and a rock to all. !!!

Is there a Macmillan Buddies or Volunteer scheme for example?  My ex broke up with me about the same time as I was diagnosed in November 2013 at the age of 56yrs. I went through the majority of treatment on my own as have no family apart from my mum who's 91 yrs and can't deal with any kind of shock ( she does not know I've had breast cancer). So I know what it's like to feel very alone.  You could contact Macmillan and ask them to intervene on your behalf with work? You are covered by the disability act. Technically work should not discriminate against you.  I saw a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor for three months at the hospital where I received treatment on a weekly basis and it helped a great deal. I was in shock at the time of diagnosis, my initial response was that I wanted to die too, as felt there was not much to live for, that I had a life in which I had achieved a lot of what is wished to achieve;  albeit no family or kids ( but I spent years trying to put that one in place), so give myself 10 out of 10 for effort :-) The Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor also referred me to a charity called Odyssey who organise and pay for holidays for people recovering from cancer.  So in September 2014 I had a lovely week's holiday in the countryside in Kent. I think GPs or other Health Care Processionals can refer you also to Odyssey. I also went back onto Citalopram 20 mg anti depressant which I had come off, at point of diagnosis. This was because I knew that I didn't want to experience the total rage I felt, which probably shot my cortisol levels sky high! As the other ladies ( & G'nJ ) point out there are also local support groups for people too. Love Judith xxxx",

This is our forum and we can write as little or as much as we wish!!  I don't feel inclined to take Tamoxifen at all, if given a choice. I had very bad PMS every single month from when I started my periods until they ceased at the age of 52 yrs. It could be I was deficient in Magnesium all those years? I had seven days of the month, when I felt well, then the symptoms of PMS would build up so by day 27/28 I felt about to explode: fluid re tension, tender gums, sore eyes, back pain, feeling of pressure on my head, tender breasts. I had this every single month.  I tried: changing diet, taking evening primrose oil ( helped), homeopathy, Bach Flower remedies, herbal remedies, acupuncture ( helped), exercise( maybe I was magnesium lacking?). The GP recommended that I go on the pill for PMS, I refused as did not want another set of issues. I was dreading the Menopause as a result of my experience. However, my periods tailed off & it was such a relief!! The menopause was not an issue, never had a hot flush in my life or night sweats. This I see as a blessing after awful PMS thorough out my reproductive life. My mum had no problems with PMS at all, so I don't know why I did? She did however have fibroids and a total hysterectomy in her 40a, they took it out whilst she was under the anaesthetic.  I do believe that the inactive fillers are the cause of the side effects, otherwise why are some AIs more tolerable than others? I have not tried Cipla. Accord brand for me is dreadful the worst medication I've been on so far.!! I wonder if Femara would help me? I don't feel inclined to take Letrozole cheaper version, based on my experience of Anstrozole. Best wishes Judith xxx",

Oh wait: I have Lymphoedema in right breast.  Lack of sleep is causing me to be lack lustre and irritable.  I have started CBT and found my first session really good, I had back pain all day so missed second session. Third session I over slept due to not getting to sleep until 4:00am. I saw my Breast Care Nurse yesterday,  who is lovely. She suggested I try hypnotherapy as the Breast Care Clinic Psychological Therapies Macmillan  Counsellor is interested in people trying it for relaxation. I would like to find a medication that I can live with for the next 9 years!!  Love Judithxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Small note of caution, I had a WLE & 4 LNs removed in Nov 2013. This was followed by Rads Jan- Feb 2014. Due to the type/stage of cancer found I did not have Chemo. Following the surgery and Rads treatment, I developed Cellulitis 3-4 times & took  antibiotics as recommended by the Lymphoedema Support Network www.lymphoedema.org . Cellulitis is a bacterial infection which untreated can become accute and require an emergency hospital stay. Fortunately I took anti biotics  which dealt with it; however the result is, I have Lymphoedema in the operated breast. It is mild but there permanently. I take daily penicillin VK to avoid a recurrence of Cellulitis as recommended by Professor Mortimer. ( Lymphoedema consultant).   I would suggest, watch the op side( or sides) monitor any redness, heat, swelling or pain, in case it's Cellulitis. Don't carry heavy loads so as not to put a strain on Lymph nodes area, which have been operated on or removed. Avoid extremes of heat/cold, bites, scratches, bruises, cuts , skin breakages to affected side/ sides.  Not everyone who has had Breast Cancer & the surgery/ treatment goes on to develop Lymphoedema, it is approximately 25%. I would suggest wearing a supportive, unwired, sports type bra. I went without a bra following surgery As no one advised me to the contrary. Please do the arm exercises twice a day , this helps prevent cording which I did not get. I now wear a non wired M&S sports  bra which comes in a pack of two, one black, one white.  Do have daily exercise, this will help with your recovery and emotionally helps too. I found reflexology at the hospital where I was treated really helpful and relaxing. Exercise also helps with the side effects of hormone inhibitors,  if you have to take these little \" treasures\" too!! I'm on Arimidex Astra Zeneca for 10yrs, unless Onc decides to put the  number up again ... Sincerely hope not ;-)  Acupuncture is brilliant, I had it for really Bad PMS every month in the past,: 58 now:-) . I tried lots: Homeopathy, Bach Flower, Herbal Med, changing Diet, lots of long walks. Only Acupuncture helped a lot.  However, as I now have Lymphoedema ( which can develop at any stage in the future), I would suggest a conversation about inserting needles in the quadrant of the body that has been operated on? I will email my Lymphoedema practitioner about Acupuncture, as I found it very beneficial too! So I do agree with Julie's view but, with a caution as to possible consequences. It may be that if the area of Lymph Nodes is avoided then it is safe?  I would be interested to know the view/s of Acupunture practitioners regarding the possibility of developing Cellulitis/ Lymphoedema in affected body area via needle insertion, as the key phrase is \" skin breakages.\" I will contact the secretary of Professor Mortimer Lymphoedema  Consultant too, for his views. If it is acceptable,  with the proviso of avoiding the quadrant, then I'm interested in Acupuncture as it can make a big difference I've found. Judith xx    ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I am 58 yrs on Feb 16th, and trying to sort out the Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) I am taking for the next 9 yrs as started Dec 2013. Diagnosis: 41mm, Grade 2 invasive lobular carcinoma of right breast associated with lobular neoplasia in situ. Lymphovasular invasion present. ER positive, PR negative, HER2 negative. 0/4 lymph nodes involved. WLE & sentinel node biopsy 25/11/13. I have been taking Anastrozole various makes the latest being Accord ( awful). Over Christmas my local Pharmacist ran out of the generics & gave me a month's emergency pack of Astra Zeneca Arimidex ( which I felt had less side effects). I contacted my GP for a prescription for Astra Zeneca Arimidex she referred me to the Oncoligist. I received a letter from his secretary yesterday. To summarise: he does not feel that inactive fillers are a factor in the side effects I experience from certain makes. He took part in a research team, which compared Anastrozle with Letrozole. \" A good proportion of women preferred Letrozole over Anastrozole\" ( why I ask?). His recommendation: I switch to Letrozole 2.5 mg daily ( note no mention of Femara in the letter). Then: \" If you do not get on with Letrozole then I would suggest switching to Tamoxifen 20mg daily which is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator and often causes less arthralgia than the Aromatase Inhibitors\". ( Tamoxifen may cause an increased risk of endometrial cancer). A nurse at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton ( Lymphoedema clinic: told me that research was being undertaken by them as to why so many women stopped taking Tamoxifen). I would be very interested to hear peoples' views as feeling very fed up at this stage. I currently have insomnia, fatigue, no energy, back pain, joint pain down right hand side, searching for words, eyes hurt. Feel 90y , same age as my mum :-( I saw my Breast Care Nurse at the clinic yesterday she listened and commented that I should see a GP and let them know how bad I feel. Also that I should request Arimidex Astra Zeneca or Femara. I have my next appointment with the Oncologist 21/4/15. I take Adcal Vit D3 daily and penicillin V ( to stop Cellulitis ) 250mg daily. Please could other people let me know their experience and any advice please? !!! Thank you. Judith x",

I saw my BC Nurse last Friday and see encouraged me to let my GP know how bad I felt on Anastrozole ( Accord).  So I took along the empty Arimidex Astra Zeneca packet & the Accord Anasrozole pkt & she finally write me a script for Arimidex : taken 4 months to get it. She wanted to check again that the consultant had ok'd which he had. Dr had also received a letter from my consultant ( I had copy) saying that I should try Letrozole if continued to have bad side effects. If this was the case, then I would request Femara. I have not taken an AI since last Wed and notice a difference! My aching joints are much better . I should pick up prescription at Boots for Arimidex today after work. I also am on Trimethoprim currently as have another UTI so 2 lots of Anti Biotic at once! Maybe they will have a party & invite Citalopram & Ad Cal along :-D  Love Judith xx",

I have insomnia, fatigue, joint pain in hand shoulder ( right handed) back pain and general lack of energy. The generic form ( cheaper) of Anastrozole is mixed with inactive fillers. It is the inactive ingredients which are thought to cause the side effects in some people. I'm on the make Accord at present which is awful. I tried Arimidex Astra Zeneca the original registered drug, over Christmas for one month as the local Pharmacist ran out of Anastrozole : generic/ cheaper. I noticed an improvement in my side effects. My GP has not prescribed Arimidex Astra Zeneca ( due to cost) . The Oncologist wants me to try Letrozole. ( Registered expensive original is  Femara). I am reluctant to try Letrozole for the same reasons I don't like taking Anastrozole. The Oncologist last October suggested Tamoxifen, I said worried about the increased risk of endometrial cancer on Tamoxifen. He did not answer that question . The Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton is currently under taking a survey into why some many women stop taking Tamoxifen. A nurse told me there while I was attending the Lymphoedema clinic for a diagnosis last October.  I was initially told would be on Hormone inhibitors for 5 years, then 10yrs last October 2014.  What do others think please? I know that some people have been successful in having prescriptions for Arimidex Astra Zeneca & Femara, but it seems to be an uphill struggle to be prescribed them. Love Judith xx.",

I was diagnosed with BC Nov6 13, had WLE, 4 clear Lymph Nodes removed. This was followed by Rads 22/1 - 12/2 2014. In June-July I developed Lymphoedema in breast operated on. Currently have Cellulitis, ( painful) and on Penicillin V Potassium for 3 months initially with a view to Prophalatic dose long term depending on results. I had the condition Lymphoedema & an infection confirmed this week at The Royal Marsden Hospital by a Lymphoedema Consultant. I commute an hour and half to London from Brighton. I live alone ( my ex and I split up last November after 10yrs ). I feel very alone at times, as have no family except my 90yr mum who was admitted to hospital last week. It's at times like these that I imagine that it would be good to have had children as I would not feel so lonely. Though my school friend in Wales divorced 10yrs ago and has had no contact with either of her two sons since then, even though she's a grandmother now. The Consultant ( and the nurse who spoke to me following the consultation) said that it would be useful to look at changing from Anastrozole. I am going to see if my Oncologist would prescribe Arimidex the original Registered drug to see if I can tolerate the inactive fillers better. I have joined social groups locally and try to get regular exercise as it helps. But it is hard when there is a lack of sleep to be positive. I have an Oncologist appointment on October 24th so will request a change of medication then. My BC Nurse is kind, but very busy. I shall see if she can attend or see me on the 24th October. I have made an appointment for CBT counselling, and on waiting list. I saw a counsellor for 3 months which helped at the hospital where I had Radiotherapy. I was also buddied up with a volunteer from Macmillan Community Buddies which also helped & was for 3 months too. I am going to look into the local Meet Up Groups. I attend a BC Support Group which meets the third Monday of each month for an hour & a half. I am going to look at getting work in Brighton, but as I'm employed by a Local Authority, this is probably going to be difficult. Truth is it is HARD to feel motivated when you don't feel well. The positive points of my day yesterday were finding £220 that someone dropped at Victoria Station, (the last amount I found dropped was £50 about 14 yrs ago.) also at work helping to arrange a meeting to support a young person in Care. I do enjoy my work ( Youth Work) as it is satisfying to make a difference and help young people move forward in their lives. As I had a difficult upbringing I can identify with issues such as domestic violence, and really try to support young people get into college / training and improve their lives in general. I know this is a long post, thank you for reading. I hope to get some sleep finally. I do wonder about another 4 yrs on this medication too! I hope that you can catch up on sleep too.

So on recommendation I changed brands and was eventually asked by the Onc if I wanted to try Letrozole ( Femara) or Tamoxifen instead.  But knowing that in some cases Tamoxifen can result in other SEs.  I said no. Last Dec 2014, the local Pharmacist ran out of Anastrozole & he provided me with one month's supply of the original drug:  Arimidex made by Astra Zeneca and I noticed an immediate difference in a decrease for me of SE. So I persuaded my GP to write me a prescription for Arimidex instead.  I still have insomnia and feel tired 80% of the time, but I don't get the aching joints any more. Judithxx",

Rads ended Feb 2014, I subsequently had a few bouts of Cellulitis & great pain ( different antibiotics given), then developed Lymphoedema  both were contained within the breast operated on. I had a consultation (referral via my diamond GP), with Lymphoedema Consultant Professor Mortimer at The Royal Marsden in Surrey Oct 14, who officially diagnosed Cellulitis, & Lymphoedema and accordingly prescribed Prophalatic  penicillin 500mg for a year initially. I am now a member of The Lymphoedema Support Network LSN www. lymphoedema.org There are recommendations on www about the  specific antibiotics to be requested from GP. Radiotherapy may produce further side effects. It may be useful to enquire about different antibiotics if you are in pain as untreated Cellulitis may lead to an emergency  and hospital treatment. I would be inclined to see what can be done for the infection, before having Radiotherapy on an inflamed site. I hope you get some further answers from the hospital specialists. Thinking of you.

I do eat strong cheddar cheese and have full fat organic milk in coffee and tea.  I take Ad Cal D3 1500mg 2x day in addition to Anastrozole.

Look at the picture objectively from the outside if you can. How would you advise a close friend who asked you for advice about this scenario?  Think of the people who ARE there for you & don't give the \" power\" to those who are apparently not, would be a good way of thinking about it I suggest. But yes, it is easier said than done.  My mother is 91 in hospital following a fall in Dec and I'm currently going tbrought the process of trying to find suitable residential accommodation for her in N Wales. I'm doing this completely on my own. Mum does not know that I had early stage BC in Nov 2013, as she cannot take any kind of shock due to her nervous and depressive nature. My ex split up with me the year I was diagnosed. I have no children. So you do have people on \"your side \" which is a blessing. The family that care about you will stick with you through thick and thin! Wish you well. Love Judith xx ",

The breast pain I have in operated breast IS as a cause of Radiotherapy. It is Tietze's Syndrome, one of the triggers is inflammation caused by Radiotherapy : Radiation.  So a relief not anything serious. He also let me know that I have Arthritis in the left hip ! This explains why I have pain all the time ( more or less) in that region.  So, now I want to know what is it exactly? The type and how to treat it? Also has the Radiotherapy made it worse etc etc etc! I have always been fit and done loads of walking: maybe I have worn it out? But I'm 58 not 85?   I  am taking Arimidex Astra Zeneca: started  on Anastrozole Dec 2013, various brands & had various side effects. Arimidex is the best for me now. Am I on it for 5 or 10 yrs? don't think I can stand 10 yrs of it!!! I can't take cod liver oil as repeats on me with gastro/ nausea etc. :-/. I am thinking of seeing a Nutritionist as would like more reliable information regarding vitamins/ minerals/ supplements and what to take? When I asked the Consultant if I should be taking VitK : 2 Mk4 or Mk7 along with the Vit D to aid absorption in the bones; he seemed suprised and repeated  AdCal VitD3, which I know about already & take on prescription.    So I did not get any information on vitamins there!  :-/  I am probably going across to the Miserable Cows' Club now as I feel more moaning coming along !!

I think that you may have joined a Scottish Group following your posts on here?  Although, unlike you I don't have any siblings step or otherwise. I do now have a rescue Siamese cat : Pia , who is very noisy and certainly fills up the silence :-D !!!! Yes,  it is hard to go through all this C*** alone, but please remember, whether you choose to reply to posts or not, you are not alone on here. Incidentally, I doubt whether ALL other countries treat their elderly in a superior manner to the UK. Please look after yourself and keep your chin up!! I don't know why your post today was deleted?

It took 4 months before I got a prescription for it from my GP. The side effects are easier to deal with, pain has subsided. I started AIs on Dec 6th 2013, so it is the drug that's easier to cope with I think, the various brands have different inactive fillers and these do cause different reactions in people. Good luck.

When I presented the letter with appointment time to the receptionist, she had another appointment time listed for me! Some services ( appointments ) are outsourced in Brighton. The extended scope practitioner that I saw had to cancel the appointment following mine due to the time overlap. He was annoyed with the appointments system, & suggested I contact PALs if I wanted to raise my concern. On that day, I was too tired and just pleased to see him,  Luckily the MRI was clear.

A Lymphoedema clinic / Nurse is the first port of call. My GP detected the Lymphoedema (& Cellulitis) in my breast which was operated on, last November. Lymphoedema is a side effect which may happen in the op area, or arm/ hand at any stage, as the Lymph Node Removal ( & Rads) may cause this condition, there is a build up of Lymph fluid as the drainage system has been damaged. It may be that in due course I will wear a compression garment on my chest,or have taping, I will know after appointment with Lymphoedema Consultant Peter Mortimer next month. I have Cellulitis at present, just 3 days to go now of Amoxicillin:though in some cases people have to take low dose of anti biotics for life to reduce reoccurrence of Cellulitis. The Lymphoedema Support Network has lots of useful information & and an online forum. www.lymphoedema.org.uk Wish you well Judith xx",

My ex ( who liked a drink ) decided he wanted to relive his youth & then I was diagnosed with breast cancer in Nov 2013!! It felt like everything was going wrong at once, and I had no one to turn to !!!!  This forum has made such a difference to my sanity ☺️  Avril said what I was going to: you can support your family through their difficult times, your son will stop drinking when he's ready. Your husband too. I know how your daughter might feel, as I went through something similar! As someone once said\" things fall apart so better things can grow\"!  Look after yourself.

Please contact your GP tomorrow and if he /she's not kind and understanding see another in the practice. Please also contact your breast care nurse as you are still in recovery and this pain needs to be sorted out for you ASAP. Ring Macmillan Nurses too and see what they say?  I live alone too, so know that it's hard when there's no one to turn to for a hug. ( or a friendly purrrr) Though I'm thinking of a cat as had one a few years back and it did make a difference.  You are not alone on here Sammi !! When I had my treatment I saw a counsellor for three months at the Hospital, she is a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor, is there a counsellor at your hospital or Breast Care Clinic? Are you in contact with local support groups? You could ring Macmillan & find out what local community groups there are? I had a volunteer visit me one hour a week for three months, this was through Macmillan. There is also TeamUp ( Macmillan) who help with shopping, housework and such like.  Can your painkillers be changed to ones which are more effective?  I'm sending you an E HUG. Judith xx",

I have tried Smear Test : 3 times at local GP practice: first practice nurse(PN) said \" I can give you some Oestrogen cream for that\" when I pointed out that I'm ER+ she shrugged and said\" you will probably need a general anaesthetic then\". I left surgery feeling humiliated. She also used two speculums that did not fit ( I've not had children). Second PN was lovely, kept saying relax, but it resulted in discomfort and bleeding. Third PN was equally kind. and treated me like a human being. She said that the muscle had not been stretched for a long time ( too true. ! ) & provided me with a plastic ( small ) speculum to take away and practise stretching the area. I can see the irony in this. No Pelvic Floor Ex necessary for me!! I currently am taking anti biotic for bacterial infection in op area, so exercise in THAT area on hold :-) Be kind to yourself and please don't feel that it is a some kind of weakness on your part ( as I did). Some of my Anastrozole side effects have settled down via Replens and long walks ( joint pains). Do get a bone density scan done too! I had to chase this up with my GP surgery as GP I saw did not follow through request, subsequent GP did and I had it last month. I'm taking Ad Cal supplement with Anastrozole daily. I'm to request another scan 18 months time. Also inform/ provide copy of scan to Oncologist as Drs Surgery does not forward copies on. Try also to get support emotionally : this has been crucial for me, as in my employment I'm am a Youth Worker who provides information, advice & guidance and care. Fortunately my lovely counsellor at the Sussex Cancer Centre is extending her time & providing another 4 sessions. This brilliant site has helped me feel less alone and I so appreciate it :-) I'm sending you a virtual hug and to everyone who reads this, love to all! JMP. X.",

This was followed by Rads Jan- Feb 2014.  I started on Anastrozone ( as 56y), various makes and found the side effects difficult, I then went on to take the original drug Arimdex Astra Zeneca in April 2015.  The Oncologist wanted me to switch to Tamoxifen ( or Letrozole ) last October 2014. When I said Tamoxifen increases risk of DVT and some other cancers ( and can thin hair). He did not answer. Currently I am in a lot of pain with arthritis in my left hip and pain  in the Sacro iliac joint and taking Co Codamol every four hours. It is especially painful lying down, so sleep is disturbed, and sitting, not easy as work in an office. In the morning it takes 30 mins or so for the Co Codamol to kick in & decease the pain. I sent an email to my BC Nurse asking about the % difference of recurrence if I stop taking the AI. She has not replied to my email. I have been seeing an Osteopath weekly since July and feel that my sacro iliac pain is probably caused by long term usage of Arimidex/ Anastrozole. My right side of the body is longer than the left. This has never been an issue or caused me pain until July of this year. I also have raised blood cholestrol which I read is one of the side effects of taking Arimidex. The previous GP in my practice wanted me to start Statins, I have not.  The current GP is trying to sort out my pain ( more useful) & has referred me to Orthopaedics & provided a prescription for Diazepam, when I questioned why? He said that it's a muscle relaxant and to take if the pain is severe. I don't feel inclined to take it at all. As far as I'm concerned, Co Codamol is something I would prefer to avoid. But paracetamol has not effect on the pain whatsoever.   I have only been on AIs since 2013 and the thought of being on them for either 5 or 10 years  leaves me feeling why live in pain all the time to prevent the possibility of cancer returning? Any recommendations for a comfortable mattress please? I have a Warren Evans( 2nd firmest in range think it was called Victorian)  but have had it quite a few years. It needs replacing I imagine.     I am interested to know others' views too. Thank you for reading. Judith xx",

On my dad\u2018s side there is no one.  My ex has been surprisingly supportive and visits me regularly to attend hospital appointments  with me etc. That does help a lot as I don\u2019t always take details in due to tiredness. I also have another friend who\u2019s been there for me. I\u2019m 61y and was hoping to work until 67y ( thanks politicians ). Now I don\u2019t know anymore. My work was with teenagers in a Local Authority.  For sources of support outside your family contact Macmillan and find out what\u2018s In your local area. Other places to offer support  are eg The Haven ( London I know of,  others you could Google), Maggie\u2018s Centres,(ditto),  Macmillan has monthly meet ups for people which offer support for those affected by cancer. You could see if that is offered in your region.   There is also the Penny Brohn for people adjacent to Bristol.  A lot of useful information can also be found at www.breastcancercare.org.uk   Why not set up a rota for your children to do various tasks to support their mum eg washing, housework, shopping, etc? Or if that doesn\u2019t appear to work maybe  an increase in rent to help with expenses of travel to hospital appointments and so forth.   This will help your family to feel more involved in your care.  Macmillan in some regions offers a Buddy system where a volunteer can visit you once a week for a chat or meet you at  cafe etc. There are also Macmillan volunteers in some areas who will do light tasks eg shopping, put out rubbish for those who have no other support.  Macmillan can also advise you whether there is a Macmillan Counsellor in your area or you could find out about counselling via your GP.( might be useful for your daughter).  If sleep is an issue ( lack of) you could ask your GP if they will prescribe Melatonin? My GP would not prescribe me sleeping tablets as I\u2019m on Chemo at present, There is also the brilliant \u201cAwake\u201d  discussion thread where peole can post well into the night (or day), and let off steam ..... :-)  Love Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Willow, No you are not jinxed!! It seems like this because random events of mismanagement, I would suggest have occurred. This compounded by your present health and emotional vulnerability are the factors involved, from an objective viewpoint. All the staff at Princess Royal Hayward's Heath where I had my WLE last November were so kind and professional throughout. The surgeon & anaesthetist & nurses introduced themselves to me & were reassuring & professional. It really made the experience easier. My GP has been truly inspirational throughout, from point of diagnosis up to the present time ( I never thought that I would rhapsodise about a GP ). She has totally supported me every step of the way. I currently have an organised & committed BC Nurse ( 3rd time lucky), who although extremely busy, reads and answers work emails. I saw a very kind Macmillan Psychological Therapist ( counsellor) at the Breast Care Centre at the local hospital where I had my subsequent Radiotherapy. She made very helpful suggestions for social activities, : as my ex who wanted to relive his youth,was seeing a new flame, it did not last ......:-) So I joined two support groups, so far, also been told about Odyssey ( a charity which organises breaks ). I have been on a Health Walk too, and will do more. I've tried meditation at a local Buddhist Centre with a volunteer \" Buddy\" organised by Macmillan for three months. The volunteer is a Buddhist, and I found meditation beneficial and relaxing. I hope this helps Willow xxxxxx When you are stronger decide what will help you disperse your feelings of hurt, anger and frustration. This site is for expressing all that we feel, and thank you for sharing. In Scotland, is there an equivalent to PALS? I wish you lots & lots of positive things!!! Look after yourself and give your husband a BIG hug: 200 miles wow. Best wishes Judith xxxxxx",

He examined me and I have Lymphoedema in the breast operated on and an infection/ Cellulitis. I will be on Penicillin V Pottasium 500 mg x 2 daily for 3 months initially, then possibly on an antibiotic for propalatic long term. I have seen a local NHS funded Lymphoedema Nurse via a referral from the Onc at the hospital. I saw her three times and she could not provide MLD due to the inflammation and pain. My GP faxed a referral to the Lymphodema Consultant's Secretary and I subsequently got an appointment. The Lymphoedema Support Network which I joined £15 annual subscription: provide a medical alert card and lots of leaflets by post ( I've got very useful info from them ). When I was at The Royal Marsden Hospital the Pharmacist queried the prescription from consultant as she had never heard of a prescription for antibiotic as a propalactic long term. As I had a spare \" How to treat Cellulitis\" from the LSN with me, I gave it to her. She said I've learnt something today! www.lymphoedema.org.uk No one mentioned the possibility of Lymphoedema to me prior to my WLE. I think Lymphoedema is more wide spread than is known! Good luck to everyone. Love Judithxxx",

He said my Lymphoedema was due to a number of things ie Lymph Node removal, and Radiotherapy plus having larger breasts. I have Cellulitis in addition in the op area, which is painful. It may be I've had an infection since the WLE op last Nov. Sometimes Cellulitis can occur for no apparent reason. You are right about taking anti biotics abroad just in case, very wise precaution.

I take Arimidex Astra Zeneca Tabs as ER+ ( been told for 10yrs, though at time of prescription was told 5 yrs by Onc). Also take Adcal VitD at same time as Astra Zeneca. Adcal  assists the bones and prevents thinning. Diet: look at Blue Roan's  very useful blog on Nutrition :-)  I have had some side effects from Breast Cancer Treatment, please see my profile page. As strange as it sounds I bought a jar of Organic, raw, unpasteurised Sauerkraut yesterday  :which is described as vibrant & living on lid:-)! Apparently it can help your gut by assisting with the good live bacteria. I had some yesterday and it tastes fine. I am on daily penicillin to prevent recurrence of Cellulitus so interested in foods that help my gut.  Also suggest a multi Vit & min tab if you feel tired. Magnesium is supposed to help with tiredness and low mood. ( which often go hand in hand I find). Judith xx",

I had a bone density scan in May 2014, which indicated that I was going towards Osteoporosis, I asked for a copy of the report for myself at the Drs as she was sent one ( but not me). I also took a copy of it and handed it to the Onc at one of my check ups , for my file there. As they weren't sent a copy either. ( Brighton & Hove area). I would ask your Breast Care Nurse for verification about all this, if she is not forthcoming or approachable, find another one; that's what I did. They are paid to provide support to people on this journey of ours. You should be able to receive information and a listening ear when you need it, and this continues after your active treatment ends too. I have put a reminder in my Phone calendar about a follow up check up bone scan, I think it's due in a year's time ( or 18 months)) need to look into that myself! You could ring and send an email enquiring about this scan & how it's arranged and by whom? You could also ask for a copy of your treatment file? If you don't receive a response, go in person to clinic/ hospital/ your GP and start the ball rolling! Wish you well. Love Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I had Rads Jan- Feb 2014. You get a planning meeting to discuss the treatment and for the Radiology staff to do various measurements. You should also be getting a date for a Bone Density Scan to assess  the bone health before you have Radiotherapy . Please ask your Breast Care Nurse or Breast Care Team who organises this and when? I was not notified that I had to request it via my GP so ended up getting the test in May 2014!  The Radiologist will put tiny tatoos ( should be pin prick size), on your skin to help them direct where to line up the Rays. The tatoos which are permanent don't hurt. I had no tats previously, now I have two! One between my breasts & the other under my arm pit. Ask your BC Nurse for a Macmillan leaflet on Radiotherapy and side effects. There will be information on this www too.You may get pen marks in addition at a session, these do wash off.  My advice is drink lots of water, rest, wear a soft bra at all times, put E45 cream or similar on area 2-3 times a day,I did this for months afterwards,  dont expose that side of your body to water/sun  that's too hot, avoid cuts, scratches, knocks, carrying heavy bags etc. It varies for everyone how much time it takes for recovery, I was tired for about 3 months afterwards from the Radiotheraoy treatment.

      "Content": "Hi Siani, I am 57y & going through cancer forced me to look at my life and what matters to ME. I was with a partner who's emotionally needy, though intellectually very smart. I think it's a pattern as my mum (90y), has lived her life with a glass quarter full attitude to everything. My dad who died at 90 was emotionally needy with very low self esteem. Please don't accept negative comments on your abilities or perceived lack of them from anyone. Instead focus on what you enjoy and can do :-) Anger CAN be used to drive people forwards, when I was diagnosed last November: my initial reaction was I wanted to die. I had achieved much of what I set out to do. ( granted I have no family except mum). Then I wanted to attack strangers ( & blame it on cancer). So, after coming off Citalopram 20mg not long before being diagnosed, went back on it (!), and felt calmer. Now I'm on Anastrozole for 5y, have Lymphoedema, & Cellulitis, though made appointment with consultant to see how I can sort L& C out. Taking Amoxicillin at present. I have sight problems too. Walking / exercise does help ( with my mood). What support do you have from friends/ family?Can you speak to people who are there for you & won't judge? Is there a Macmillan counsellor at the clinic/ hospital where you had/ have treatment? I saw one for three months & it made such a difference. She told me about the Odyssey Holiday. Are you in touch with support groups for breast cancer survivors in your local area? Are you in contact with your Breast Care Nurse? Is there a Macmillan volunteer Buddy Scheme in your area? I saw a lovely person for three months each week. I live alone ( ex in London). Last week I went on an Odyssey Holiday : free funded by Macmillan/ donations). There were 8 women there with various health issues and we all had different experiences of cancer. My ex had stayed in my place and on my return I spent from 13:00-10:45pm in different pubs listening to his problems & how depressed he is. Relationships should not be a power struggle, but team work I think. The break with Odyssey was just what I needed at this stage, emotional support, exercise and FUN.! Use that anger to try different experiences and new things. I also have problems sleeping ( chronic snorer), I will work that one out in the future:-D . Look after Yourself , Love Judith xxx",

I mentioned Femara/ Letrozole and he said: I will leave it up to you to make this decision. He also referred    me back to my GP for prescription. She said I must refer back to hIm as he is the specialist. I've been off work with an upper respiratory infection since Tuesday. Going to H& B to get Manuka 20. Oncologist also said I would be on Aromatase inhibitors for 10 yrs, as 5 yrs not felt to be adequate. I don't feel inclined  to take Tamoxifen. Regards Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi MamaSm.  I was diagnosed with initial Breast Cancer in 2013, had a lumpectomy, 4 nodes removed ( clear), low stage 2 so had Radiotherapy only. Post op, I developed Cellulitis in op breast followed by Lymphoedema in op breast. Fortunately that resolved with a few months of antibiotics and MLD with a NHS Lymphoedema nurse ( referral by Oncologist).  Then I was  NED and to take Anastrzole for 10yrs. I actually took Arimidex ( Astra Zeneca) after  badgering the Oncologist and my GP until they relented.  In December 2017, I had backache and Diarrhoea ( which I put down to Arimidex).  The GP I saw is married to an Oncologist, and she referred me for a scan.  On 4th Jan 2018, I was told by the Oncologist that I had Secondary BC stage 4 ( Mets). To say I was surprised and devastated was an understatement !!! Mets in spine and sternum and also the major one near heart.  I asked the Oncologist what the % was for Secondary BC. Her reply was one in three. I think that if that knowledge had been available to me on completing my Radiotherapy in 2014, then I would not have felt SO shocked in Jan 2014. However, I appreciate that not everyone would share my take on things. Once there is a treatment plan in place it will become more organised. Though the shock will take time to process. I still sometimes think it\u2019s not really true However, I have been taking oral chemotherapy tablets Capecitabine for a year Feb 2019. To start with 4x twice a day, ( SE too strong eg red and hot hands and feet and extreme exhaustion). Now on 3x am and pm and much better.  Main SE dry skin/ eyes/insomnia/ heartburn/ and lack of energy.  Also if there is  a Macmillan counsellor or Maggies Centre/ Haven,  do contact these excellent resources for complementary therapies eg massage/ reflexology/ reiki/ yoga / counselling etc.  Secondary Breast Cancer is underfunded in terms of support ie Secondary Breast Cancer Nurses. There is one, part time nurse where I live for the whole of the Health Authority !! Some areas have good support, others SNC nurses are not in place.   There are in some areas monthly social and topic meet ups for secondary breast care patients. I have been to the local one and the other ladies who attend are great. I thought it might be very depressing, but it is not. The Area SBC nurse attends  each one. The meeting is arranged via: https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/information-support/support-you/secondary-metastatic-breast-cancer  And  https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/information-support/support-you/secondary-metastatic-breast-cancer/living-secondary-breast-cancer-meet-groups  Keep posting and we will be here for you .

      "Content": "Hi Lindsay,  A big welcome to the forum! It is a huge shock to receive this news and it does help to focus on what practical measures you can do at this stage. I did not have Chemotherapy, there are many many wonderful ladies on here who can answer queries in this area.  Support I feel is vital now that you are going on the treatment path. From my experience, it helps to have a partner/relative/friend with you at meetings with the Oncologist/Surgeon/Radiologist etc as I found that I could not take in and remember all that was said. If you find yourself alone at any stage request ( before hand) a nurse to be present to provide support.  Try to get all copies of appointments & reports of your treatment etc sent to you. You should receive a treatment plan  Also ensure that you can be yourself and open up to your Breast Care Nurse. This is important as they are working to support you through ( and post) your treatment programme. I was allocated a BC Nurse who was insensitive to my situation at the first meeting. The second BC nurse worked part time was run off her feet and \" did not read work emails\". The third was brilliant, worked full time & returned work email requests for information promptly. Try to get appointments sent in post and emailed/texted reminders to you ( sometimes post goes astray).  When I left messages for my second BC. Nurse I did not get a prompt response, so for me the answer phone message was not a good option. Maintain a good relationship with your GP, see someone else if  they're not there to fully support you.  My GP has been very supportive and noticed when I had infection post operation as I was too much in shock to notice anything much at that stage . Find out whether the clinic or hospital has a local support group for BC patients. I joined one in April of  last year, it helps. Also see if there are Reflexology or Massage sessions available to patients, my local hospital had a volunteer each Monday afternoon. Depending where you live, there are Maggie's Centres and The Haven ( google for details). I also saw a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor at the Hospital for 3 months, that helped as I had split up from my ex & was completely alone following initial Radiotherapy session.  Macmillan has a lot of useful support booklets online.  Do the exercises as recommended by the Breast Care Team, don't go bra less at all, don't wear under wired bras again, ( risky), be kind to yourself, if you feel like crying, then cry, much more healthy than bottling up emotions. Finally write a list of Questions before meetings/ appointments so you can get the information you need eg like WHO organises what exactly? I missed a basic bone density scan before starting Anastrozole as was not told I had to approach my GP to organise it. So it took place later than it should have done. Hope some of this helps. Best wishes: Judith xx. :-) ",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, A very big welcome and a hug from me!! I checked your profile & in view  of your general health; I think that it would be wise to contact your GP, breast care nurse, ASAP.  ( you can still see a BC Nurse  even though you've finished treatment) and also see a Lymphoedema. Nurse in your local area. In other words, start contacting your breast care team contacts to get it investigated.  Details regarding Lymphoedema and Cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection : symptoms include pain, heat swelling and pinkness can be found on the website www.lymphoedema.org.   There are also details to be found on that www of local Lymphoedema  Consultants, I saw Professor Peter Mortimer in Oct 2014. He covers London & Sutton. Has a clinic at The Royal Marsden in Sutton and The Royal Marsden in Chelsea. Your GP could write a referral to see him ( mine did) or it may be a referral via your Oncologist/ Breast Care Nurse, just to put your mind at ease? I had a Lumpectomy, 4 LNs removed in Nov 2013, Rads which  ended Feb 2014. I had 3-4 bouts of Cellulitis 2013-14, took anti biotics.  Saw Professor Mortimer at his Lymphoedema Clinic at the RMH in Sutton he diagnosed Cellulitis & Lymphoedema in the breast operated on. I was prescribed Penicillin VK 250 mg a day for a year as a Prophalatic . I don't like taking penicillin long term, but was not at all well when I had Cellulitis. Professor Mortimer also recommended wearing a supportive sports bra ( non wired, don't suggest wearing a wired bra ever again). M&S do a 2 pack: sports bra one white/ one black. ( non wired) around the £30. To take regular exercise, he suggested swimming and to avoid extremes of temperature to that quadrant of the body. Also to avoid carry heavy items,  playing tennis, bowling or breakages of the skin on quarter side of the body. Hope this helps. Look after yourself. Love Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sandy, Welcome to the forum! Nice to have you with us all :-) What you are describing is normal, as that is a lot to go through in a relatively short space of time. Crying  is fine, much better bottling up all your feelings. Shock affects us in different ways. When I was diagnosed Nov 6th 2013, I was in disbelief as had my told by my GP's practice nurse that I probably had Mastitis, but after two failed lots if antibiotic I was referred for a mammogram and other tests and received the news. I felt enormous rage and only cried once on the day I came home from my operation ( WLE) with my ex, who did stand by me for that period of time. I know if I'm honest that it still hasn't sunk in that I've had and been treated for breast cancer.  Not sure if it would help you to speak to someone about how you feel? I saw a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor for. 4 months at the Hospital where I had my Radiography. It really helped to speak to her each week. The hospital also had a vounteer who provided Reflexology and Aromatherapy to patients too. There are Maggie's Centres and The Haven  in various parts of the country where people can meet up and get support.  Best wishes Judith x",

      "Content": " Hi rexsi78  Yes it is difficult experiencing cancer ( twice in my case), while single. Take it day to day I imagine.  Both my elderly parents have passed away : 2012 and 2016.  I have no children, no brothers and sisters, no close family. My mum was adopted and my dad\u2019s brother stopped contacting him in the 1950\u2019s. I found his details some years back &  spoke to him on the phone ( as his niece), his response was a casual \u201c Oh is he still alive ? \u201c ( Nice ... so I didn\u2019t bother again).  I found my mum\u2019s real half sisters many years ago, through an adoption organisation. They lived in London and the South East and my mum was happy to meet them and vice versa but ....they had nothing in common.  I live alone with a Rescue cat who provides company of sorts. I had to retire on ill health grounds  from full time work as a Youth Worker for the last 18 yrs with a North London Local Authority,  which I enjoyed.  I\u2019m now taking chemo tablets long term and have  daily stomach injections at GP ( blood thinners 1 in 10 with cancer can get DVT or blood clots in lungs).  I had blood clots in lungs which have decreased, also had a minor blood clot in leg a year ago. Started  the injections last Nov, DN calls at weekends: I hate needles !!! I hope to go on tablets instead at the start of June,  then maybe I can socialise more eg yoga Pilates volunteer gardening etc. As yet I don\u2019t have a network of friends where I live now.  Nights are difficult, as I don\u2019t sleep well, the Macmillan forum is a godsend. The Awake Thread on Breast Cancer is a good one to look at. Judith xx ",

I would rather hold a spider or snake than inject myself! I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve noticed getting any colder since being on blood thinners since last  November. I do catch BBC Garden\u2019s World for the delightful Monty Don ( Dolly the Sheep ... why can\u2019t Monty be cloned instead imagine 1000\u2019s of Monty Dons everywhere on the BBC on every programme..... Make a change from Huw Edwards reading the news !). I digress, yes I know about open gardens & The National Open Gardens Scheme,  the details are free online.  \u201cGardens Illustrated\u201d  is a lovely magazine too, I like looking at the pictures and imaging what could be if I had more energy. I usually browse through it at a shop or supermarket. If there\u2019s an article I like, but am not interested in the rest of mag I take a sneaky pic with my phone instead.  My way of reducing the carbon footprint. Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hello Fiona, I am so sorry that you feel so shit at present. I'm 58yrs and had a WLE, 4LNs removed in 2013, followed by Rads 2014. Physically it took me 18months to get over the op & treatment, in the main. The physical & psychological after effects are still there, for people who go through this disease at what  ever level I think. I'm on Arimidex for 10yrs. It could be that , shock, anger, extreme fatigue, pain, despair are all there seems at the present time. (Rationally you don't know this is your last Christmas.) Lack of sleep is AWFUL, I agree whole heartedly,  it stops peolple from having the energy to do even the small stuff!! You don't have to be anything other than yourself at present. That's all any of us can be! Think about your family & how they might support you, do you feel supported by them? What did help me was to do what I could, and let the other stuff wait ( or leave it completely). Also I spoke  to a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor at the hospital where I received treatment and went back on Citalopram 20mg. My dad died & my partner & I split up around the time I was diagnosed & I have only an elderly mother: so I felt at that stage: I did not want to continue. But that feeling passed, once I started receiving support from my Counsellor, & had a course of CBT referred to by my GP.   Now I'm two stone heavier with fat  round the stomach which I realise likes me & the feeling is not mutual :-) I had pretty bad hip & back ache since July this year, I had weekly Osteopathy since July  which helped and I'm finding walking easier again. I'm sending you a BIG e hug. Love Judith xxxx",

My hair is not coming out too much at moment, though I'm on Anastrozole for 5 yrs, so not sure what future will bring. I started work ( gradual phased return) last week. It was tiring ( 1.5 hrs commute each way). However, it's a start. I have ultrasound and X-ray's tomorrow on op area as have what appears to be Lymphoedema, hence no more heavy lifting. Got appointment with L Nurse on Thurs morning, as confusion over times last week. I'm still doing the recommended exercises by Macmillan until I know of ones which will assist me now. Had quite a bit of back and joint pain earlier on, so trying to be positive ( though not succeeding at present). My ex has been there for me at the serious moments, operation and early radiotherapy, but it is hard otherwise, there have been times when I' be wanted to let my mum : 90yr know. But who would benefit certainly not her. I intend to join more social groups, in two at present, again it's a start. I will look into \" Maggie's\" too. Thank you for letting me know about that. Match.com is on the back burner too! Best wishes JMP x",

      "Content": "Hello all, I've been taking Anastrozole since Dec 6th 2013. This week has been particularly bad emotionally & I've felt very down. I went through the Menopause at 52yrs and had no great sense of gloom, or depression. My side effects on Anastrozole, include lower back pain and pain in my feet. I'm taking Ad cal to counteract the bone thinning. I also have insomnia. I have not worked out which brand makes me feel worse ( though I'm on Teva at present). I got Sandoz for the next lot. I've also taken Accord too in past. Is Femara a brand of Anastrozole? My hair is also thinning too, as a result of these tablets. The Oncologist said in Feb that if symptoms persisted, i.e. vaginal dryness & UTIs, Tamoxifen could be tried in October. I don't know if that's a good idea though. I'm 57 and another 4 yrs of this is a depressing thought:-( I'm taking 20mg of Citalopram daily, ( higher doses can cause heart problems). I don't like taking anti - depressants and had come off them completely, prior to be diagnosed with Breast Cancer last November. Today neither chocolate nor a long walk helped me feel better and that in itself worried me. I had my final session with the Macmillan counsellor at the Clinic who's been wonderful & supportive. She suggested a course of CBT so I'm going to give it a go. I also have Lymphoedema in breast which had WLE. I am going to ask my GP if she can refer me to St George's Hospital to see Professor Mortimer. Or failing that see someone at the Lymphoedema Clinic there. I know breast Lymphoedema is less common than in the arm. The advice and information I've found has been on an American Lymphoedema website. Do others have this condition and any advice please? I saw a Lymphoedema nurse locally but didn't feel any difference after seeing her twice and I don't know whether I should wear an ordinary soft bra or a compression garment( not until I've had the referral). My BC nurse is on A/L until 22nd. It is hard in the middle of the night alone. Thank you for reading. Judith.",

      "Content": "Hello Heather, I am so sorry that things are difficult for you at present in terms of information and support. Yes a diagnosis of cancer does have a profound impact on life. I was very scared when I received my diagnosis last November. I went for a Mammogram, regarding another problem and the cancer was picked up at an early stage. I had no symptoms or knowledge it was there. I found the Oncology Team professional but kind. The BC Nurse who was appointed to me made flippant remarks regarding my work, & I knew that I did not feel at ease in her company; so I asked for another BC Nurse who although friendly was over worked. I felt as though I was imposing on her. I too tried to get through for information and ended up leaving voice messages. If you can get the email address of your BC Nurse, ( & anyone else) in terms of communication this could save time. I'm also Oestrogen +. I had gone through the menopause already, my problem had been REALLY difficult PMS every month, year in year out. So when the menopause happened I was dreading it ... but I was very fortunate and had no hot flushes or sweats etc... amazingly. I sought counselling via the hospital cancer centre, and have been seeing a lovely Macmillan Psychological Therapies Cancer Nurse Specialist. Also I contacted a local organisation of volunteers :Cancer Buddies organised by Macmillan who provide weekly visits to your home or out and about for an hour a week. This again is beneficial for someone to be there for you and listen to your concerns and help with information. The hospital counsellor has provided a lot of support and information too eg Macmillan Team Up who will help with domestic stuff eg cleaning, shopping, if you're not up to it. Though I got through it as was not that unwell. I have tried to keep active following my WLE / lumpectomy. I had Radiotherapy following op, which was ok. I was advised to put E45 cream on the whole op area breast: which I did. Also to do the exercises following op: did them. The Radiology Dept staff were wonderful, sensitive: I cried throughout one early session. More through lack of sleep and stress. The actual Radiotherapy is fine, they play music of your choice to relax you too. If you wish. I was on my own throughout this, with some support from my ex. Any port in a storm .... :-) I had also moved to a city where I knew no one. I felt VERY tired once the Radiotherapy had ended. The fatigue went on 2-3 months, probably compounded by delayed shock. Initially on being diagnosed, I felt in a daze, up & down, very depressed some days. Went back on 20mg Citalopram, as felt anger towards complete strangers! Now 7 months later, I'm on Anastrozole for 5 years. Had 2 UTIs had anti biotic, now take Replens daily via exemption medical certificate. GP should write a prescription, when you've at that stage. My GP has been wonderful, so supportive and kind. I may have Lymphoedema in the breast. Seeing a Lymphoedema specialist tomorrow. Advice to you don't do any heavy lifting of anything on op side in future. I have had joint pain in back and knees & feet, also some hair loss due to Anastrozole. I try to eat properly and take regular exercise to counteract the pain, it helps. Did you have a base bone density scan, before you started hormone treatment? I did not realise that I had to request one via my GP as no one told me this before I started hormone therapy Dec 6th. So eventually I requested one, & had it in May. It shows that I'm going towards Osteoporosis, I have given the Oncology Dept a copy of the results for their file on me, as GPs surgery does not post them on to the hospital. Also I need to remember to request a follow up bone density scan in 18 months time, from my GP. I have also joined a local support group for women with BC. They are really friendly, supportive and offer free Reflexology, Aromatherapy and Reiki during their support meetings. Meditation can help too, I went with the volunteer to a local Buddhist Centre for open drop ins. Also yoga can benefit people too. I hope some of this helps. I'm going to attend a workshop too by an organisation called: Yes to Life. There are a couple coming up in London, see www as there are probably events throughout the UK. Best wishes JMP xx",

If. X-rays are to be done, ask who will organise them? If things seem vague from medical staff, ask for clarification and get it in writing if possible. Make sure your team follow up on everything, within their capability. I'm thinking of you ! Look after yourself Love JMP xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Gilliemck, The recovery time varies from person to person. I second the others in that it would be wise to get things checked out with your Breast Care Nurse/GP/ Breast Care Team. I had a Lumpectomy + 4 clear LNs removed in Nov 2013, followed by Radiotherapy Jan- Feb 2014. ( No chemo).  I am taking Arimidex Astra Zeneca as Hormone +. Will be on them for 5 possibly 10 yrs.  Following surgery & Rads, I then developed Cellulitis ( Bacterial infection) in operated breast: which became red, swollen, warm to touch & painful. This was diagnosed by my GP who put me on antibiotics which I took for months. www.lymphoedema.org has lots of useful information on how to recognise and which antibiotics are recommended for Cellulitis, also how to recognise Lymphoedema.  October 2014, I was diagnosed officially with Cellulitis & Lymphoedema by a Lymphoedema Consultant Professor Mortimer at The Royal Marsden in Surrey, and prescribed  Penicillin VK 500mg x2 daily initially for a year. Fortunately for me, the Cellulitis finally went. So I stopped taking Penicillin April 2015, I am left with mild Lymphoedema in the breast. The point of this email is that the side effects can go on for many,  many months. I was told that Radiotherapy side effects can take up to 18 months to settle down. The healing and repair of the body takes time & this varies from person to person. The side effects of Chemo I can't speak for. Please get the area investigated. Also do keep up the daily exercises to prevent cording and lack of mobility in your arm. I did the exercises twice to three times a day for months and had no problems with mobility. Wish you well.

      "Content": "Hi June, I read your post and would like to comment on the reference to Lymphoedema. I'm 57 ( 56 at time of op). My understanding is that  Lymphoedema is a side effect of breast cancer treatment. I am slim, take a lot of exercise, but larger in the bust than you are. I had a WLE & 4 Lymph Nodes removed, Nov 2013, followed by Radiotherapy: ended Feb 2014. The act of surgery and Lymph Node removal plus Rads may lead some people, to develop Lymphoedema.  My advice to try to minimise the risk of developing Lymphoedema, would be to wear a supportive ( non wired) soft bra following surgery as much as possible ( this was not emphasised to me by anyone), To do the recommended exercises on a regular basis; to avoid any heavy lifting on op side, avoid rough movement/ stretching, to avoid cuts/scratches/bites/ bumps  to that quadrant of the body. To avoid strong perfumed deodorants, may cause skin reaction  (also not healthy as  usually contain aluminium and parabens) ; to monitor the op area for signs of change eg redness, swelling, heat, pain : which could be indicators of Cellulitis. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection which may lead on to Lymphoedema.  Sorry to bang on about this. But being overweight  is not a reason for developing Cellulitis and/or Lymphoedema. For more information on this topic, eg   \"What is Cellulitis?\" and \"Reducing the risk  of Upper Limb Lymphoedema\" , though I have it in the trunk ie where op was, please see:  www.lymphoedema.org    I wish you well on this path we all walk together. Lots of love :-) xx Judith xxx",

Sleep is so important try to get it when you are able to, even if that means it's in the daytime. I've been a poor sleeper for years: as my mind won't switch off ( side effect of work). My under arm is still numb but less so, due to nerves being cut. If you can go on short walks in the fresh air ( gradually build as you get better); this may help with sleep. Try writing down your thoughts and worries too: lots of people are here for you:-) Also see if there's a Counsellor/s available at the clinic or hospital ( or GPs surgery). I've seen a wonderful counsellor since Jan. I hope this helps. My GP prescribed sleeping tablets but I did not take them as taking enough medication already :-) You could try the usual : Nytol, Quiet Life, etc from Boots. I watched lots of daytime TV in the early days to take my mind off it. And I bought myself flowers and try to eat good food and not too much rubbish :-) ( or in smaller amounts).

GP referred me for mammogram and early stage breast cancer was picked up in top right hand side of breast.  Following this I had Lumpectomy and Radiotherapy and I'm on Arimidex  for seven more years.  A few years previously I had felt a lump which turned out to be a benign cyst.  I feel that your girlfriend could benefit from further  tests e.g. mammogram/ ultrasound to provide more information in this instance.

My life has not been \"normal\" either, but as my ex would say what is normal? And how would he know? I too live alone, late 50s, no children/grandchildren, or siblings either. My upbringing shaped to an extent me today: prolonged emotional abuse from a father ( the son of an alcoholic), and a mother who was emotionally dysfunctional ( adopted and treated like a domestic servant). My parents moved quite a bit too, so I never could settle at any particular school. Not a lot of money either. I grew up wishing my parents would divorce, at a time when it was not the norm. Being an only child can definitely have its disadvantages! I also did some travelling in my 20s &30s & worked abroad, which has been enriching. My dad died at the age of 90, in his latter years I no longer felt animosity towards him. I'm aware that I could live for a considerably long time! My mother who lives in Wales is now 90 too. She does not know I've had cancer, as I can deal with my distress, but NOT her's as well. My mother's final employer died of breast cancer. Anti depressants have helped me, the ironic thing is I'd just come off them when I was diagnosed in Nov. But better to be on them for now, than have feelings of anger and aggression towards complete strangers who don't share this \"experience.\" I have been off work since November, and since moving away from my ex : an intellectual and seemingly rational person who wanted at 50 to \" have fun & take lots of drugs & date younger women\" I'm now in a city where I know no one. However, I refuse to accept that this is how it's going to be for all times & I have joined 2 local \" groups\" because we are social beings in the final analysis! Why do people sit in pubs? ( Q for ex ) :-) My work was/is emotionally demanding and so recently having time to dwell entirely on myself has been hard. I have sought social support from Macmillan via a volunteer and also a counsellor at the hospital. You could consider this too, if groups are too much ( at this point). When I return to work, I hope to get over my non regular sleep patterns. Lack of sleep does not aid recovery... I wish you well. JMP.",

I agree with others' comments: follow up the whole line of communication back to your GP and check everything!  This is what I would consider doing : Find   out if there's anything you can do e.g. email your local MP ? When you email anyone (in addition to telephoning), copy in LOTS of people always  e.g. MP, MP's admin person,PALS,  your GP practice, hospital staff, local Macmillan centre,  etc etc. Don't accept waiting and doing nothing in the meanwhile.  Visit the hospital say hello to reception staff introduce yourself,  ( so they know who you are a face, instead of a number on a waiting list) Find out info in advance, look online does it give info on the BC Dept?  Send emails regularly e.g. once a week, let them know how it's affecting your health and emotional wellbeing ......and if you don't receive replies, telephone & leave messages.  Sometimes there are cancellations, you need to  be in their thoughts as much as  possible. ( in a nice way of course, always polite but PERSISTANT).  There are many reasons why lines of communication break down including: forgetfulness, items being lost, annual leave, staff sickness, changes in procedure, mistakes, laziness, lack of checking, assumptions, people not talking to each other, and so on......  As someone said on here \" the squeaky wheel gets the oil \" !  Love Judith xx ( originally from Gwynedd). ",

Avoid underwired bras in future. Not to carry heavy loads on op side. Avoid extremes of temperature on op side. Plus any breakages of skin.  I had 3 bouts of Cellulitis ( bacterial infection)  2013-14, followed by Lymphoedema ( mild) in breast operated on.  So at any sign of pain, redness, heat, swelling get the area checked ASAP.  I think it's better to be safe than sorry.

I had a phased return to work ( which is recommended by Macmillan ), and met a doctor at work ( Occupational Health Unit). It really does depend on the individual, and what sort of work you do, and your body recovering and healing. When you see your Breast Care Nurse ask her for copies of booklets such as Cancer and the Workplace, 10 top tips for Employers ( information for managers about how they can make it easier for you to return to work on an individual basis. These publications are on the Macmillan website too. You can also apply for a medical exemption certificate. My GP was great and wrote medical certificates in retrospect when I was unable to visit her. I returned to work full time last month. I wish you well for the 20th, take it one step at a time. Love JMP xx",

But not sure if eyes is from Anastrozole or because I am on Penicillin V Potassium long term to prevent Cellulitis returning in Lymphoedema area of WLE breast? I now seem to watch every little ache and worry about the risks of a reoccurrence. No, I never used to think about any of the small aches and pains in past either. Hope you get an answer to the pain in hip soon. I had a mamagram and US in July to establish for sure that I have Lymphoedema which I do. Also requested an x ray on my back which showed wear and tear plus further damage due to Anastrozole taking Ad Cal Vit D3 since Dec 13 too. Look after yourself. Hug Judith x",

And colds that went to my chest & caused loss of voice and bad coughing too, which dragged on for well over a week each.  I am taking penicillin every day for a year in addition to my other medication. This is to prevent a reoccurrence of Cellulitis  which I had last year a few times. Insomnia from Anastrozole does not help either! I had the flu jab early in November no idea if this will prevent anything?  So I bought some Optibac Pro Biotics to try and help my poor old guts:-)  I hope you feel much better soon.

My wonderful Dr who saw me  from diagnosis stage, through treatment and after & was my rock ( split up with ex around diagnosis ), left the practice at the start of the year. She was my GP for the last 5 yrs. She was so supportive and really listened when I saw her. Also diagnosed Cellulitis following my op.  ( I had another exceptional Dr when I lived in London who retired when a drug user tried to stab her). The other Drs at the practice are all male. Ok, but not the same eg one saw the blue boob ( post op) and said what's that bruise ? When he knew I'd had a WLE etc. Another has a nervous twitch & I found it hard to focus on what he was saying.  So I have got a different practice and seen one GP who is fine, but I will miss my last GP who has moved to London.  As for miserable cow club ...some pics c/o Pinterest my fav way of passing time :-) Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Puzzle, I had a Lumpectomy (WLE), 4 LNs removed in Nov 2013, followed by Rads in Jan-Feb 2014. Following surgery & Rads, I developed a bacterial infection: Cellulitis which resulted in the op breast being painful, very painful, hot to touch and pink/ red.   I was referred by my brilliant GP to a Lymphoedema   Consultant Professor Peter Mortimer, who I saw at The Royal Marsden in Sutton ( I live in Brighton).  I saw Professor Mortimer in Oct 2014, he recommended Penicillin VK 500mg twice daily for a year initially to deal with the Cellulitis. By April 2015, the Cellulliitis had gone & the Onc said you can stop with the penicillin. I had daily diarrohea too :-) Professor Mortimer also recommended keeping up with the post op exercises,&  stop wearing wired bras: as pressure of wires can impede Lymph flow in the area. He recommended a supportive, non wired sports bra instead. He said wear it in bed at night for support, which I did until the  Cellulitis went & the area settled down.  By summer of 2015 I could have Lymphoedema Massage with my Lymphoedema Nurse & so the whole of surgery & Rads took approx 18 months to settle down. I have a check up with my Lymphoedema nurse in March.  Things to avoid with the op quadrant area, are cuts, scratches,razor cuts, harsh chemicals,  burns, skin breakages, sunburn ( on Rads areas ), great changes in temperature. Also pulling eg carrying heavy bags, vacuuming, tennis: which puts stress on the area/ quadrant. Luckily I don't play tennis :-)  As I had the WLE & Rads on the right hand side, I was told to avoid injury/ damage to the right quadrant of the body ie the right side that the Lymph flows around as Lymph Node removal & the WLE put stress on the area which may not Chanel the Lymph flow efficiently and not deal with infection due the the WLE & LN removal. I carry a tube of Savlon antiseptic cream with me at all times. If I did get an infection in the area, I would seek the recommended antibiotics see www.lymphoedema.org for information. Untreated infection can lead to Cellulitis : high temperature & possibly a hospital stay. Cellulitis can result in Lymphoedema too if left untreated. Both these conditions can occur at any stage in the future. So it's important to take care & be vigilant. Important for MedicAl staff NOT to take blood pressure or put injections in the arm/ area either as this can put the area under stress/ introduce infection too. I have a Medical Card from the Lymphoedema. org. Some people wear am Medical alert bracelet in the affected arm. Not everyone develops Lymphoedema, I believe it's around 25% but I could be wrong here?  Wish you well. Judith xx A lot of useful information can be found at www.lymphoedema.org.uk  ",

      "Content": "Hi Broken Emi, A BIG welcome to the forum :-)  I remember my diagnosis moment well and being in total shock ( Nov 2013), my ex who was with with me at appointment was shocked too ( unusual for him). It helps to see the treatment process I feel in stages. Try to get support for meetings eg family, friends or your allocated Breast Care Nurse. They can take in what you might not. Also request copies of letters, your treatment plan. I used to  ( still do) email my Breast Care Nurse. If you don't understand anything ask for explanations and get it written down. From diagnosis point to back to phased return to work took a year for me. I'm now 59yrs. Recovery time varies for people. Be kind to yourself, rest as much as you need. Get others on board to help you with stuff eg shopping cooking cleaning etc etc. You can get through this! Love Judith xxx.",

      "Content": "Hi JD, No I don't think you are over reacting at all. You've been through major surgery and have every right to feel ill treated in my view! I would suggest contacting PALS as you may have been placed in an area which compromises your safety. I had my WLE last November with GA, this was the first time I'd had it since tooth removal at the dentist many years ago. I had my anaesthetic injected was wheeled through to the op theatre, then wheeled back to the recovery small side room ( with nurses present) where I'd had my initial anaesthetic. No other patients were present. Then my ex collected me and we got a taxi back to my flat. I am not happy about the way you have been treated! Even if they're over stretched and just keeping it together, it's your health that matters. Why were you expected to get up & sit in front of a TV? I was encouraged and helped by a nurse to get off the bed and sit in a chair, then given a cup of tea and a biscuit when I felt ready. Do you have a Breast Care Nurse to contact? I found a lovely person at the third attempt ( who's busy but reads and answers work emails).I'm seeing her for a catch up next Monday. If you are worried about your wound, see your GP or BC Nurse ASAP. I think the steri strips come off after 7 days, but don't quote me on this. Also be very careful, follow recommended exercises, and beware of getting Lymphoedema or Cellulitis which can occur as a result of the treatment for breast cancer, which can cause these as side effects of the treatment. I am sending you a hug & wish you good luck for Thursday:-) Let's us all know on here how you get on ? Love Judith xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kiwi Card, I had Lymphoedema in my op breast following a Lumpectomy, then  Rads(2013-14)  then got Cellulitis, followed by Lymphoedema in breast.  I had a GP referral and saw Lymphoedema Consultant Professor Peter Mortimer at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton. He prescribed Penicillin V antibiotic  which I took for a few months to get rid of the Cellulitis infection. He also recommended wearing non wired sports bras for support. I wear M& S two pack £29:00. He told me not to do anything like tennis ( I don't anyway) and to avoid lifting too heavy loads on the op side.  I saw a Lymphoedema Practitioner via a referral from the Oncologist and once the Cellulitis had gone she did some MLD on the area. Gradually it got better over about 18months, There is a lot of useful information at www.lymphoedema.org    Judithxx. ",

Many people recommend Ports or Pic Lines, there will be someone along who can provide links to these soon.  It appears that Ports are not offered as standard ( though Karang/ Lynn will confirm they are in Australia :-) ).   So it might be worth asking about the options available to you in addition to Cannulas.  Judith xx",

No one from my BC Team told me that I had to speak to my GP to request one, as the Health Authority ( Brighton & Hove) contracted them out to a private Clinic. So I had Rads Jan- Feb 2014  & the bone density scan in May 2014. Yes, you are supposed to have checks every 18 months I think. I was going towards Osteopaenia. ( or however it's spelt) Judith xx",

So in the HF season I take Loratadine daily plus a nasal spray, when it's bad as I get difficulty breathing on those days.   I'm going to try Curcumin as read that Tumeric is a useful supplement. I need to drink more water too and am working on that! Judith xx  ",

The cause of death on the Coroner's Report is pulmonary embolism and DVT.  The graveside service is next Wed 1st June at 11:00am.  I was much closer to my mum than dad, he passed away in 2012 aged 90. I am just trying to sort things out and have had lots of lovely messages from people on here and my work colleagues. Enjoy your holiday Denise. Love Judith xx",

I know what you mean by feeling alone! I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 6/11/ 2013. My ex actually came to appointments with me. But now I'm on my own, with no family, just my elderly mum ( 90yrs) in Wales. I'm starting to make friends locally where I live now, but it's a slow process. I'm on Match.com too as there has to be ways and means of meeting prospective partners in your 50s and 60s?  I too have Lymph oedema ( in operated breast) and saw Professor Peter Mortimer at the Royal Marsden Hospital (Sutton), regarding it. Professor Mortimer works in the London area and Sutton & is a specialist in secondary Lymph oedema caused by breast cancer treatment. I had a referral from my GP. ( excellent ) to see him. In addition to Lymph oedema, I've had Cellulitis for months, in the op area also. This is being kept at bay by Prophalatic anti- biotic.  The Lymph oedema Support Network www.lymphodema.org has lots of useful information. You are allowed to contact your breast care nurse still, for information, advice and support that is if she is approachable?  I'm still in touch with mine. ( the third ) who's very kind and is interested in my progress post treatment. I had an appointment with my Oncologist on October 24th and will see him next in April.  I shall be receiving Lymph oedema treatment at The Royal Marsden in London, got my first appointment next Tuesday. Flower you can do it! Make that call please !! Love Judith xx",

I was a low 2 and advised by the Consultant not to have Chemotherapy. My ex came with me to the op and first session of Rads & then I was on my own. I live alone too & know how difficult that can be.    I sought support from my Breast Care Nurse ( once I'd found a kind & sympathetic BC Nurse), my GP who was truly wonderful throughout from my point of diagnosis through to post treatment, and a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor. I saw the Macmiilan Counsellor for three months at the hospital and could let go of my feelings in a supportive environment. I contacted my local Macmillan community group and they arranged for a volunteer to visit me once a week for an hour for a chat eg local coffee shop or in my flat or for a walk. There was also the option of \"Macmillan Team Up \" in my local community with volunteers who organised shoping or light house cleaning eg vacuuming, but I was never that poorly.  I was off work from Nov 2013 to Sep 2014. As following op & Rads developed a bacterial infection : Cellulitis and was on Anti biotics for months, then got mild Lymphoedema in the op breast. The after effects of Radiation took about 18 months to settle down. As I'm Hormone + I took Anastrozole from Dec 2013 to April 2015 when I switched to Arimidex Astra Zeneca, which suits me better. These tablets have affected my memory to a small extent, definitely result in poor sleep, consequently I feel tired a lot of the time : 70%, I also now have arthritis of the hip and Tietzie's Syndrome ( Inflamation in the chest causing pain from the Radiation ).   Luckily, I have never had hot flushes, as did not have them during the menopause (52). Though had bad PMS every month instead! So there are some blessings:-).  Try to find what support is there in the community and on this wonderful website too! Love Judith xxx       ",

I asked my Oncologist recently  if I could try Arimidex (Registered drug ) instead to see if I could tolerate it more, and he tried to steer me towards Tamoxifen ( which I feel apprehensive about taking for 10 yrs), and oestrogen cream. When I repeated my request to try Arimidex, he  referred me to my GP for a prescription, and she referred me back to him. I don't feel supported now treatment had stopped ( Feb 2014). I feel very alone, and really little things do bug me  eg when I write full answers to posts here and don't even get a thank you! ( this is so petty I know) , and with the amount of sleep I'm getting at present, it's hardly surprising I'm feeling paranoid. Yes I feel angry, I'm on Citalopram and still feel angry. I think about stopping Anastrozole and am too cowardely to do so. I don't feel positive and get gloomy thoughts. I live on my own now and that certainly doesn't help one bit.  Though at work, I am very positive and do not show my true emotions. I saw a counsellor at the Breast Care Clinc for 3 months and that helped. My GP has referred me for CBT. and I have am appointment this week for an I initial meeting. I had an appointment  organised by the local health authority for Oct 29th and then they canacelled it and offered me an appointment tomorrow instead. My worry is that I'm going to get really angry with the counsellor ( male) tomorrow as I broke up with my ex last November too in addition to being diagnosed with breast cancer.  But maybe that is the ideal location to let it out.  Judith.",

I can't afford to take any more time off work, live alone and have no savings ( silly me). I don't drive, smoke, drink, live in a housing association flat, so can just about manage to juggle finances to work and pay bills etc. However, I find now, that I'm tired 80% of the time.  The flooding was caused by the Housing Association Maintenance Team not checking ( service charge: ha ha), the debris which had filled in the balcony/ gully outside the kitchen of the flat above me. This has happened 4 times in 4 years. I have made a formal complaint. The young couple who moved into the flat above me last March, were not informed by the Housing Association to check the gully outside on a regular basis. So from Feb 2014- Nov 14 it filled up with moss etc and flooded with rainwater through my front room ceiling on Nov 2nd. At some point I have to organise dates for the whole room to be redecorated yet again :-/  Thank you for your reply I hope that you are feeling ok ?

I rang and explained that I had just cancelled my credit card with bank. So by time I got there,  I condensed an hour into 30mins. it did help as I really needed to vent my frustration at that stage! I hope to see him again soon.  Today I felt  less stressed, though I'm still dealing with water damage from a blocked gully from outside the flat above mine. Latest occurred on Monday 3rd Nov. This has happened 4 times in 4 years. The whole room was redecorated by the Housing Association this year in Feb. I have put in a formal complaint now. I had a massive De Humidifier for a week which was taken away last Tuesday. However, still managing to commute an hour and a half to London from Brighton.  Saw a really interesting programme: Horizon on Dogs and how they communicate with humans earlier this evening.

I was subsequently offered the appointment on Wednesday with a male counsellor (CBT) and I thought it actually may be more beneficial for me to express my feelings in a safe place about how I feel being dumped by my ex. This will be one of my objectives in the future while seeing him. ( not sure what his CBT focus will be).  Sleep is still a major issue!

The physical has healed, BUT I wonder about reoccurance elsewhere and then try not to think about it.  I wish that I could say I feel better,  but I worry a lot. I have visited The Haven in Fulham and am having a course of Acupuncture which does help me. I don't know about the Macmillan Hope programme? I live in Brighton and a new cancer centre called New Horizon will be open at some stage this year.  I have seen a Nutritionist for  the first time and given up coffee and tea, but I don't sleep any better to be honest.  I'm taking multi vits/ mins to help liver etc. Citalopram anti depressant 20mg, taken myself down from 30mg per day.  I feel tired SO much of the time when I'm not at work. I'm 59 and used to have loads of energy.  This forum is really helpful as people here\" know\" what it feels like, once treatment is over and it is time to continue as before, only it is not like before.

When I was diagnosed in 2013, I was in total shock anod wanted to lash out at people, I felt such extreme rage. I saw my GP who prescribed Citalopram which I still take. Try not to panic & look ahead. Take it in stages, this helped me. I also saw a Macmillan Psychological Therapies Counsellor at the hospital for 4 months and this helped. See if there are any therapies eg Reflexology, massage at the hospital where you have treatment? I visited The Haven in Fulham last month and will have some acupuncture with them later this month. The emotional/ psychological after effects of cancer in my case are still there. It takes a long time to process I've found. Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lizane, This is SO stressful for you, I am  glad to hear that you have had full confirmation that the treatment can go ahead. But.. how do you get over the shock of being given an incorrect diagnosis?  Did the registrar make their  diagnosis based on their findings alone? Would it help to express how you feel to your BC Nurse and ask her if an apology would be in order for the distress caused to you? Or do you think the registrar made a genuine mistake & deeply regrets it? I think that the way the Oncologist conveyed the information to you and the impact it subsequently had on your health and stress levels; indicates ( from reading your email), that her ability to communicate with patients regarding  devasting news is currently inadequate. It may  help to express your feelings, to ensure that others don't have to experience a similar situation. People are only human, and mistakes do happen! But as we know, prevention is better than cure.  If it is not possible to speak/ see these individuals, you could consider getting their email addresses /contacting:  via their secretaries, and expressing how upsetting the whole experience has been, and that you are very relieved to finally have the \"correct diagnosis\". When I was undergoing treatment, I saw a Macmilan Psychological Therapies Counsellor at the hospital. It assisted me with the shock I was going through at the time of my diagnosis: Nov 20113. I had a delayed reaction and initially felt quite numb as though it was happening to someone else. Now, in March 2015, I'm still coming to terms with it, my Rads ended Feb. 12th 2014.  I wish you well. Hugs. Judith xx",

      "Content": "Hi Shirleymac, I had a lumpectomy & 4 Lymph Nodes removed in Nov 2013. This was followed by Rads Jan-Feb 2014. Following this I developed Cellulitis in the op breast ( not the arm). The symptoms were pink/ red skin, heat, pain & swelling. I was placed on Penicillin VK 250 mg twice a day for    about 11months. Following Cellulitis I developed Lymphoedema in the op breast. Cellulitus can often lead to Lymphoedema.   I did not have shakiness, but I was in shock and went back onto Citalopram 20mg a day. This antidepressant helped with the feelings of rage I experienced on being diagnosed. I also went through the majority of treatment on my own. I was off  work for a year due to ill health, and then had a phased return. I am a member of Unison and they helped with information.  It may help if you could talk to your Breast Care Nurse or a Macmillan Counsellor at the hospital you attended? I found it helped me a lot. There may also be complementary therapies eg Reflexology or massage at the hospital too ? I had a few sessions of reflexology and found this helped to relax my agitated state at that time.  www.lymphoedema.org    has useful information on preventing Lymphoedema and treating it.

Blood clots: That\u2018s useful to be aware of ( SBC Nurse a waste of space as not done anything trying to be balanced but no support there at all). I was told could take injections and do them myself but as I\u2019m alone ( ex down tomorro), I said no, dont like needles at all keep eyes closed. Weird,  as I was a trainee Veterinary Nurse at 18yrs and used to assist in operations. But human blood yeuch! Judith xx",

I know how you feel having had sleep problems since started on Anastrozole  Dec 12th 2013.  Tips  which sort of help are to try to have some regular gentle exercise, and not eat too late at night. Radiotherapy is very tiring, it took me 3 months to get over it. Please don't feel guilty about all this, your body is recovering. I tend to go on Pinterest in the early hours, others on Candy Crush!

So seen by triage, given IV Antibiotic and then waited for ages and then seen by two doctors who think may not be Cellulitis but DVT.   As blood clots can be a side effect of Chemo.  So, next had injection in stomach and released at 10:00pm and got bus home. I have to return to A&E tomorrow and Sunday for further blood thining stomach injections and have ultrasound on my leg on Monday. Now have heartburn, my friend who returned to London is coming back here on Sunday.  Feel tired but can\u2019t sleep!  Judith xx",

Currently they offer 5 days holidays in Kent & Scotland. I learnt about Odyssey from the counsellor with the Breast Care Team at local hospital. She put my name forward for the waiting list. I got a call a week ago, as two people had dropped out. So next week I'm off to Kent & looking forward to it as not had a holiday in years! The website is www.odyssey.org.uk. It has information on what they hope participants will gain in terms of confidence & emotional well being. Has anyone been on one of their breaks and do you recommend it? I realise that you can't give too much away about what happens during the stay. Thank you. Judith xx",

I checked yesterday with my  excellent Oncologist. I took pics on my mobile to save time of what I\u2019m taking to run by her ie what is safe for me to take. The SBC Nurse is unreliable unfortunately.  So, in my case I have VitD 3 and Calichew on prescription and take Tumeric powder on soup ( to take chemo tabs x2 a day), can also take 1 Magnesium tablet, allowed Cranberry tablets. Not allowed Vit K2 Mk7 tablets.  Judith xx",
