      "Content": "good evening allI have been for my onc appointment today, I am having Herceptin on 23rd Oct and 1st chemo on 24th. Problem is I have just googled the drugs and they say Carboplatin used for advanced cancer!!!! not what I thought I had - report was 1.7mm tumour and 1 of 13 lymph nodes - lumpectomy all lymph nodes removed and adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer to come. Is there something I dont know? also I am to have a kidney function test on monday in Nuclear Medicine (4 hours) is this normal? trouble is I didn't think of asking at hospital too busy trying to take it all in, now gonna have sleepless night I expect. Can anyone tell me they had the same plan for treatment, i thought the kindey function test would be on urine now very concerned. any thoughts guys Thank You",

      "Content": "I was so pleased last week! going to get adjuvant therapy scans clear small cycst on liver they thought so rescan in 6 months. Ye onc decided I should have a liver ultrasound just in case it NOT cyst WOW wasn't expecting that! all i can think of now is I have gone from believing treatment for cure, to OMG if mets in liver I am a gonner. Has anyone lese been through this and come out other side. ever since they said have ultrscound i have be fixated with liver poking and prodding, is it enlarged? does it hurt am i getting pains! havent slept since 2am and although i know i cant change things even if its not a cyst but how on earth do i deal with it my head is spinning my mind is racing and my heart is going ten to the dozen just like the day of my lumpectomy op when BP went sky high. I suppose i am being wingy but i cant help but put this in writing somehow comforting ithink. Also will my treatment plan change do you think they will still give me Hercepin etc. Only hoping someone recognises how I feel. Thanks Guys",
