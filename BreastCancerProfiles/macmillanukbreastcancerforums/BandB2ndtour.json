      "Content": "Hi careermindedoptimist Good luck with your journey and it\u2019s great that you are recovering so well after your op.  In answer to your question, chemotherapy really is not awful, but the process of getting your head round it beforehand can be a bit of a challenge. The modern Chemo teams & back up support are first class, and there is a significant amount of goodwill surrounding the process. I was told before Christmas that I had a 7% chance of benefitting from Chemo, which dumbfounded me.  However, my very jolly, positive breast nurse assured me that that this was a good & positive indicator to go for.  Half way through chemo now & coping well, after a slightly wobbly first 4 days following a treatment. Best of luck ",

      "Content": "Best of luck with your Chemo, Sassymama.  I too am going down the road of a 2nd go of primary breast cancer (but triple negative this time) after a number of years, and am now 70 years young. Following a mastectomy at end of October \u201817, I was full of foreboding and dread last Christmas before chemo. As soon as I got started, felt very positive and well supported by a Fabulous but desperately overstretched chemo clinic in High Wycombe, who provided a pretty glamorous wig.  Because of having chemo previously I have just had EC X 6, but my onc originally mooted the possibility of also having a taxol/ carboplatin cocktail to provide widespread protection. He changed his mind about this whenblood counts were rather slow to climb up to the required levels, for the first couple of treatments, & strongly advised to stick to 6 squirts  of Epirubucin & Cyclophosphamide.  Now I am cautiously pleased that carboplatin on its own may be more effective for TNBC than when combined with taxol, which apparently can be a tough old drug. It may be that I could need some help n years to come. EC hasn\u2019t been at all too bad, but looking forward to having some eyebrows, lashes & hair back again later this Summer. Best of luck to you with your current journey ",

I finished on May 9th & am now recovering normal energy levels & can see some short tufts of hair pushing through. So, I really hope your Chemo journey won\u2019t be too arduous,and that you will get loads of support & love  from your family and friends. ",
