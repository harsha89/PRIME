      "Content": "Hi Naz, I had a right mx and diep flap reconstruction back in April last year. Unfortunately for me it didn't work out too well as I suffered with a lot of necrotic skin and tissue and had to have two further surgeries and as such, it doesn't look too good as I lost some of it. The actual op is long but you obviously won't know about it. It is extremely painful after as you have your boobs and tummy pain to contend with and I felt like I had been hit by a bus. With the right pain relief though, this can be managed. I managed to be up and about very slowly after a week and you really need to take it easy. The scar on your tummy will be hip to hip but I can honestly say I have gotten used to it and it doesn't really bother me, although sometimes the scar still gets tender and your tummy feels too tight. The worst bit of your tummy for me at least is the new belly button, looks and feels wrong and I am still not used to it. I don't want to put you off or frighten you but it is good for you to hear the good and bad cases so you can make an informed choice. I think overall. I am glad I had immediate construction and that there is something there rather than nothing but not sure if the diep flap was the right choice for me. Best of luck with whatever you choose. You will be fine just have a good long think about it. Marcia xx",

      "Content": "Hi Naz, I would say that the pain lessened after a couple of weeks but to be totally free of pain, I suppose a good six weeks. As I said,  the first few days are the worst, I cannot describe a pain like it and I have given birth naturally four times lol. For the first couple of days I was on a morphine pump which was great, it just means you are not with it. You will have a catheter as you cannot get up to the loo for the first few days and you will have drains from each of the sites operated on. At the time it felt like the worst thing ever and I didn't stop crying but you do get over it and your body does mend. I have heard lots of people who have had the same op have been absolutely fine with it. I still have not gone back to work as for me, the surgery was the first step and then chemotherapy and only finished radiotherapy six weeks ago, I am looking to return shortly. I would imagine you will need a good three months off work as it really is major surgery. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any questions and I can send you a pic although as I said, mine is probably not the norm. Take care xx",

      "Content": "Hi Eleanor, I finished  chemo in October and the last T I had was by far the worst and the effects lasted for what seemed like forever. It took me a good three/four weeks to have a good day but it will go, one day you'll wake up and feel good. Until then, try a gentle walk every day just to get your body moving and mobile again, it worked wonders for me. Also I had a really weird pain/sensation in my big toes too but that also went after a while. I put it down to the T damaging the toe nails as you can even loose them if you're unlucky. Hope you feel better soon. Take care Marcia",

It has mostly thinned on the top but ok no real bald patches. Its really awful for the first ten minutes but then you could almost forget you have it on. Good luck with everything. Marcia xx",
