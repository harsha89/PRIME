      "Content": "Hi Katherine, Im on docetaxel chemo and had it a week ago for my 4th session.  I have been feeling crap ever since.  I have been experiencing a dizzy head whether laying down, standing up, moving as though Im on back of a Wurlitzer and no-one will stop the blooming thing - I always hated it when my friends wanted to go on at the Fair.  The feeling goes off very quickly but after it has had several swirls round and round - and so it that another side effect? has it spread to brain?   I then spent several times projectile vomit and decided to call the hospital who didn't seem to worried about the dizziness.  But I agree with you the sickness was like you describe migrainey - always projectile vomit and then gone I felt much better but still the odd dizziness.   I am booked in for a ct scan tomorrow afternoon, the hospital will ring me in the morning as a follow up from my call today, but I am worried about the spells as I am taking my 5 year old niece to Disneyland Paris on 12th Sept and hope that flying wont effect the head.  Anyone have experience of this sort effect?  I am also struggling with having 2 elderly parents one with early Alzheimer and the other stroke related - seeming oblivious to the fact I had been sick and then grateful wen I put their dinner on the table - I wanted the cuddle and fuss and didn't get it",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone - my experience of the sore throat, bad taste, ulcers, loss of taste - all of that - hasn't been very pleasant either. In particular as I cannot drink a full cup of tea now and believe me, I'm a tea-waller !   I have resorted to drinking Twinnings Lemon & Ginger (like a herbal tea).  I had it once when I had the flu and couldn't believe the effect it had on a raging sore throat which cleared up instantly and that is no joke.  My mouth this morning didn't belong to me, I was sick yesterday and have had today the ct scan injection which feels as though its in the back of your mouth and hadn't eaten for a while and, with no doubt the breath of 1000 camels drinking stale water BUT I had a lemon and ginger when I got home and PIFF, PAF,F PUFF the world was a better place - honestly try it. Also a good thing is sweets that make you go \"pppssssss\" in your mouth like sherbert lemons. My Dad always says it makes \"your a£$ho%e pout\" and they certainly do that  ! (I do apologise if I have offended anyone but a family saying which is certainly true when you know its happening !) With ulcers try a little cup of warm water mixed with biocarbonate of soda and gargle - that too works quicker than any mouthwash and is cheaper. Mx",
