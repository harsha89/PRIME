    "Content": "Hi Just read your post as I was looking for someone who had experienced the same effects as me in my arms. What you wrote reflects everything I am experiencing identically. I started letrozole in January but I am also on herceptin and have 4 more injections to go ending in October. I was led to believe it was the herceptin that was giving me this awful arm pain but after reading your post I'm now thinking it's the letrozole! Would love to hear what happened to you, have you got better, did the pain actually go? I really hope so cos not being able to get my coat on by myself or get dressed without being in pain is soul destroying!  Many thanks ",
