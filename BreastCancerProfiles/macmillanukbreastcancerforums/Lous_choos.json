    "Content": "Hi New to this site and posting lark! I was diagnosed with TNBC in July last year and have undergone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (FEC-T). I have also found out due to genetic testing I have the faulty BRCA2 gene, so am due to have a bilateral mastectomy and full node clearance (sentinal node showed of 5 taken; 1 = 2mm cancer, 2 x micro, 2 x clear) on 23rd Jan (next week). Due to me being chemo first and it has knocked me about a bit (but I feel ok now), does anyone know if this will effect my recovery time from the surgery? Will I heal more slowly? And if so what can I do to help myself? I am back on my fruit and veg smoothies now I can taste again (3.5 weeks post last T). I am walking as much as I can (with T legs!), and trying to get myself fit for Tuesday. Many thanks xxxx",
