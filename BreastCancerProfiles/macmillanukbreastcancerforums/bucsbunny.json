    "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy 5 months ago which was a breeze.  No radiation or chemo necessary.  But I was put on Anastrozole and absolutely hate it.  I have no energy and I could sleep 24 hours a day.  I think I am going to stop taking it and instead buy myself a 50\" 3D Ultra Hi HD Smart TV so I can live what life I have left in total joy! mogal129 So glad I found this site where women can talk to women.  My journey started over 30 years ago with a biopsy .. which I have had to date around a dozen .. most were clear, but ten years ago I was told that I was LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma in Situ).  The lower outside quarter of my right breast was removed, and I was pronounced with clear borders.  Having a routine annual mammogram, this year a small 1cm lump was noticed, and after further mammo's, an MRI & biopsy I was told I had invasive lobular and invasive ductal both in early stage in the right breast.  I sat about to find an all female group of doctors .. so glad I did the work.  My primary surgeon is the head of the breast center, plastic surgeon, and oncologist are also women.  Had a bi-lateral mastectomy March 1st and I must say that I am one blessed woman .. early stage .. found ductal in situ in the left breast, also early stage (so happy I did both).  The cancer had not gone in to the lymph glands .. now comes the decision to take or not to take Anastrozole.  I am 71 years old .. in excellent health .. very active .. what do I do?  After reading up on this medication, I am not sure I want to subject myself to the side effects, and possibly end up with problems.  I am thinking 71, and if I can have a good 10 more years .. in good health .. I do not want to take Anastrozole.  And do we really know if the medication gives us an advantage ....... any in put would be greatly appreciated.",
