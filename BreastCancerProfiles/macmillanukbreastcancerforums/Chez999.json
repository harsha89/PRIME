    "Content": "Hi wonder if anyone could shed some light on what may happen if things change. Over a year a go I found a lump which I had a biopsy and found I had non cancerous microcalcificarions.  On the day of diagnosis I was advised the hospital missed something on the mammogram and had to go in for further investigations under General anasthetic where they found multiple papaloma. I have been advised these could show sign of change at any time, therefore I'm to have mammograms every year for the next 5 year's. Are there any of you out there where things have changed and further things have developed? I'm aware at this stage I'm lucky to say I don't have cancer but feel I have a shadow over me for the next few years. Any help advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys ",
