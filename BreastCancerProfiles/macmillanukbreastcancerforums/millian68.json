      "Content": "Oh sweetheart you have had a bad time, we sound alike as Im the fixer and people come to me also. Im finding it hard to be fixed by others and the concern. I need a cuddle to as I am pretending im ok but im not and dont want to let my guard down. You sound a little depressed so perhaps another visit to the doctors, strong people get depressed too. I know that one as well but once on medication for about 6 months I was fine. Be positive and no matter what happens dont think anymore then one day at a time, what ever is going to happen you have to face it. Thats how I get past each day. I am sending you a huge cuddle and I you will be in my thoughts. Do you attend any support groups? The JR hosptal have one in Oxford and think its 27th November 7.30pm. Good luck and pray your swelling is only that and nothing more XXX",

      "Content": "Hello I am so up set I had multifocial stage 2 cancer and a masectomy with an implant reconstruction at the same time. Its been hard and painful but I thought I was turning a corner and reduced my pain killers. Then on Saturday I noticed a discoloured patch of skin, and I had been leaking some sort of fluid. I have worn my support bra 24/7 and thought it was friction as I was healing and the scab coming off etc. I put a dressing on and wish I hadnt because when I showered and removed the dressing it took a few layers of skin with it ouch! I then saw a almost yellow patch of skin so I called 111 and was told to go to hospital and he said I have the start of an infection so im on a course of flucloxcillin and back on codine and have a dressing. So has anyone else been through this and if so what happened? Any advise? I am going up to have my follow up appointment on Wednesday and hoping I dont have to have treatment as I dont think I will except it. Thanks in advance xx",
