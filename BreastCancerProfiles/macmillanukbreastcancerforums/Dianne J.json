      "Content": "Thanks for the info Im not worried about radiotherapy Im just feeling around for the possibility of me having to have chemotherapy- It seems a bit unclear over the criteria for requiring chemo- I know no one can tell me until they get the results from my operation on monday but I am looking for similarities in order to prepare myself if you know what I mean. Is anyone taking anastrazole and finding that its totally wrecked their sleep pattern? and makes them soooooo nauseous? I just want Monday to come now to get rid of this alien growing in my chest!!!! love to all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

I havent updated my profile and I first came on the Mac site after my daughter was diagnosed with a grade three brain tumour but now Ive got cancer myself.
