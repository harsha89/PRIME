    "Content": "It is a very anxious time, I know, and I was trying to be strong and cope with it all... but when it came to the crunch i bottled it! My sister phoned and was willing to take a day off work (school teacher) and come with me, and I realised I not only needed someone with me but that my whole family were worried for me too! My sister's support was invaluable, especially as we both realised that it was probably not going to be good news when it was the Breast Care nurse that called us in, holding a small folder :-( Have you got anyone who can go with you? Â Believe me, it's worth it if you have... someone to share the burden and give you hugs and a shoulder to cry on. This OL community is great, and there's always someone who can share things and comfort you... I've no idea why you were told up to 6 weeks... the average time for a biopsy result is 7-10 days, but often far less than that! I also don't really know why age should determine whether they're worried or not... although it's more common in the over 40s breast cancer can strike at any age. Wishing you good luck for your Friday appointment, xx",
