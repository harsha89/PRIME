      "Content": "Hi  Mine is also grade 3 drs say its 19mm by 13mm and that they have caught it early which is a good thing but because of my age and that i have no kids i have to see a fertility specialist to discuss freezing my eggs so that at a later stage i can think about having them, between that and the tests that need to happen before i see the ongologist, its alot to take in. But i do have a great support system and im just worried in case the ct scans and the mri shows it elsewhere but i know i need to stay positive until i see the ongologist ",
