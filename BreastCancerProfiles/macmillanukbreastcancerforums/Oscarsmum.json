      "Content": "Hi i think its a matter of time to heal. Im not lifting but using my arm. deff doing exercises as know with my mum she had prob with movement , although hers was a full masectomy. I have been sighed off for two weeks. Although we are dead at work and was considering taking a extra week . I will be doing radio therphy but nodes will tell me if chemo or hormone treatment will be needed also. . Going to seem a long wait. Seem to do a lot of that. Be pleased when i know cause of action its the not knowing whats next that gets to me. Been having odd down days where have everything going round in my head. Although trying to stay on a even keel. I am trying to look at it as hope the worse bit is over.i.e the op. just have to see what im like having radio therpy. Many have said it wipes you out...what are your experices please. Thanks for reply. xxx",

I also wondered how long this would be for. good luck with your appointment and treatment. ",
