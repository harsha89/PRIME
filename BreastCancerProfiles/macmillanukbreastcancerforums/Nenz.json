      "Content": "I had my  first Tax after 3 FEC last week. OK for 4 days then developed severe muscle pains - annoyed they did not provide pain killers in take home goodie bag. Pain increased across whole back over the next 4 days so much so I went back into hospital and breast clinic for some co codamol. Its now Day 12 and i still getting pain and am still on the co codamol - I thought the pains were supposed to last for 4-6 days - anyone else had this so long ? I have also stated to get bilateral breast pain although the boobs aren't tender to touch  - am I atypical or just like all of you ?",

      "Content": "I started chemo in Jan 2012. Had an NHS wig from one of 2 preferred suppliers.I have to say its better than my normal hair. I bought a £3.50 net to wear under it and have no problem wearing it for a full day. I bought one very near my normal hair style and colour and the fitter trimmed the fringe. Its deteriorating now and a very generous member of this community helped me by giving me hers when the breast care nurse refused another voucher. I have since found that she actually does not have the right to do this as the Cancer help website is clear that as an NHS patient you can have others if you need them after 6 months but she refused despite the impact it had on my dignity and self esteem I thought they were supposed ot support us but I have had nothing but problems especially saying they would do something then failing to do it .",
