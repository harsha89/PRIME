      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Had my WLE and SNB last Friday and am recovering well with very little pain. When i saw my consultant a few weeks ago, he told me that I had a 4mm grade 1 iDC. However, on my hospital notes (couldn't help it - had to have a peek!) it said: B5b - invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2 with focal malignant calcifications + high grade DCIS. There has been no mention of the DCIS prior to this.And what does the B5b mean? I thought it was just the tiny 4mm grade 1 critter! Where did this other stuff come from and why is it different from what my consultant told me? As I was discharged from hospital on the day of my operation, I didn't get a chance to speak to anyone about it. I haven't had a chance to think about it before now due to being surrounded by my lovely family and friends but I always feel better when I have lots on info and this makes no sense. Any ideas???",
