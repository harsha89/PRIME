      "Content": "I've just been diagnosed. Had BC twelve years ago when my children were in their early 20s. My son serving in Afghanistan. Now I have 3 granddaughters, one,two and three.  I've recently had a bunionectomy and the three year old has been fascinated by it all. Demanding an inspection of my toe at each visit. When she declares \" Its getting better\" . When I had the biopsy she spotted the plaster,nothing gets past this child. Yesterday she decided to check on its progress. To be honest I'd forgotten shed seen it. So we were both a bit confused?  How do I protect myself from her sharp little elbows and sharp eyes without coming across as an invalid or her patient? I teach so everything else comes as a chance to learn but this makes me nervous",
