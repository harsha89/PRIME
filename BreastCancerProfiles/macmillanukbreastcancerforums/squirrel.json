      "Content": "Hi everyone, i am newish on here, just had my second FEC for invasive ductal. My tumour was measured when first diagnosed. Does anyone know how long it takes to shrink or see some shrinkage etc ? I am having chemo first to see if it responds to the drugs. I havent been told and forgot to ask when i will next have a scan to see if it is getting smaller. What if it isn't, ?? What if it is but hasn't gone when they do the mx ? If it has only shrunk a bit after 8 treatments why not do a mx first....i know you may not have answers and i will ask the consultant next time but thse questions have been going round in my head. Some hospitals do mx then Fec-T, mine are doing chemo then mx then radio, ummm which is best, why the difference ?? Any advice /input would be great, thanks so much xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Nicky, thanks so much for your reply. I have also just seen a reply you made to someone else on here and wonder if i can ask you.....did you have a mx,reconstruction, then chemo and radio ?? I ask because, i am having chemo, mx ( no reconstruction), radio then recon later down the line. When i asked my oncologist if i could have chemo, then mx with reconstruction, then radio, he said no way as the radiation will have a bad effct on the skin of the reconstruction, may pucker the scars etc etc make it quite unsightly. He told me i would have to wait with one boob for a good 6mths after all treatment before a reconstruction, I wasn't happy, in fact i was shocked as i thought it could all be taken away and reconstructed all in one go...ho hum ! Thanks again, hugs, Debs x",

      "Content": "Thank you Karen, Debra and Sassy, your comments have made me feel easier. I joined the forum when i was diagnosed and have been lurking there in the background, reading away, gathering info etc but was horrfied by the stories of Tax thinking it would be me in a couple of months. I am an intelligent, down to earth person and know we all react in our different ways to these chemo drugs, with FEC i have been lucky, just a week of feeling lousy then 10/14 days of OK but tired. I was a happy bunny. The having heard the horror stories of Tax, i became more and more terrified, there were no \"good\" stories, christ what is this drug !!!! Somewhere  surely there must be ladies who did ok with it ? I asked my chemo team and they said \"hey the sickness is less in Tax, yes there is some muscle, nerve pain but don't worry, pain killers work \" so i was thinking, mmmmmm should be ok, if i take my pills and rest. Ohh I don't know, i guess i will have to wait and see. Black nails seem to help everyone, so i  will do that. I already use E45 on hands and feet. Like us all on here we just want the bastard to go, so if it is bad for a while then it's bad for the cancer too and I WILL be stronger than the cancer. Thanks so much again and please don't forget to post happy stuff too for us new to chemo. xxxx Squirrelxxxx",

      "Content": "OMG what the hell, i am scared stupid after reading all the awful sad messages about Tax and how it makes you feel. I am not even there yet but christ the thought is now filling me with dread and i can't sleep. The pain, how ill it makes, you the sore feet, mouth so swollen you can't swallow, more pain, spending more time in hospital then at home etc etc....one part of me wishes i hadn't read all the messages the other part is glad i have as in some minor way i will be prepared. However taking it all into account how the f**k can you prepare yourself for the trauma ahead !!!! I have been stoic and am dealing with the side effects of FEC, the constipation, runs, sickness, loss of my hair, not even really cried just gotten on with it all. But Tax.....no no no i am struggling with this. Really struggling. I know its a great cancer killer but i have never heard one person say \"it's not so bad\" everyone  just says it's a total bastard so i can't even kid myself i will be one on the few who have little side effects. I have big balls my family say....they wont be saying that soon will they :( Very sad and scared xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I think this is a general question but as I have breast cancer which has now spread I felt I have posted in the right place....hope so :)   I have started with gall bladder problems, on the last CT scan it showed I had gall stones. This isn't connected with my liver mets, as they have shrunk and I am doing OK. I am now on capcitabine but my GP feels I need my gall bladder needs removing but it seems I cannot have surgery whilst on chemo !  I have a very aggressive cancer and couldn't come off chemo to have an op. So I am a bit confused. The gall bladder pain is awful and the flare ups keep me awake all night. If this becomes an emergency then the gall bladder would have to be removed, so why can't they just take it out anyway to save me all this extra pain, sickness etc etc ? I understand I will be at risk of infection and healing will take longer but this is keyhole surgery and possibly less risky. Anyone else had ops whilst on chemo, unrelated to the cancer ? Thanks all xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee, you are right, I am in a bit of a fix. I had a chemo break before and ended up with over 20 liver mets and bone cancer for my trouble. The break was only 8 weeks !! I have had 3 different chemo types, now on capcitabine tablets and hoping it keeps the swine at bay. Then 4/6 weeks ago pain developed which has been diagnosed as gall bladder inflammation. Chemo tends to hammer my bone marrow and puts my white/red and platelets into a nose dive. Coming off chemo is a definite no no unfortunately. My onc just said to let him know when the flare ups occur, I have, they are now every night and some of the day. I will see him hopefully tomorrow, if not him then my GP. Just fed up as I want this little bugger taken out, don't need this pain plus the fight with the cancer. See what the docs say tomorrow and a big thank you for your kindness and comments   xxxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi, finished chemo FEC-T in April, I was completely bald. Sadly the cancer returned in August and am just about to finish Gemcarb. My hair before Gemcarb had grown quiet well about and inch but mostly in a male pattern baldness way. Hair round the sides and back and whispy but basically bald on top.   Looking at it now, I am still bald on the top down to just above my ears and have 1.5 inches of good hair round the back and sides. I look so bloody stupid, like Coco the clown. I kind of don't mind-ish but sometimes it just makes me cry and I feel so horrible. Had really hoped the wig could have been mothballed by now.   I will be going on capcitabine in a couple of weeks which probs isn't going to help matters and I suppose I should be more worried about sore hands and feet and throwing up than having no hair :( Just feel crappy I guess, worried sick about the secondaries and a not too good prognosis. Ho hum :( xx",

      "Content": "Hi Kate, yep i am with you on all you say. I have had the same symptoms,lumpy sore boob, tingling in my fingers, sore under my armpit, stabbing pains, aching, seatbelt rubs like hell, so i have got a little pillow which i pop under it. I have a hubby and a son 23 and a daughter 26. I was told about my lump thursday, they day before my daughters wedding !! I am going for a biopsy weds and then the results monday after. My chest seems to be aching all over, and like you i have flashes of thinking my whole chest is full of tumours. My hubs first wife died of cancer, my daughter is actually a step daughter. Both she and her mum have a P53 mutation, her mum died after giving birth to her leaving her dad to bring her up and my daughter at aged 20 had a preventative double mastectomy. So you can imagine my husbands fear when i was told i had a lump. he lost his wife, has a daughter with a vile gene mutation and now me !! Ohhhh happy days. I kind of feel calm though right now, weird. I guess come monday i will be a total wreck. I am soooooo here for you and anyone, i may be down but i am not out, please anyone message me. You are seem so lovely. God i do waffle heehee xx",
