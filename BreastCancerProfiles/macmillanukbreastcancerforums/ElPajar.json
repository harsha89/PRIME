    "Content": "Hello   I ,wonder if you could advise,  I am still trying to decide about radiotherapy,  had lumpectomy 17mm aggressive  4 weeks ago  clear removal,  and lymph nodes were clear on scan and investigation.  still bruised swollen breast and sore, doing exercises that's helping, I know I should accept this treatment, am on letrozole 10 days so far no side effects except night sweats, but am concerned re joint pains and other reactions,  as I have osteoarthritis in my shoulder as well as knees  I understand the phrase \"you're lucky, it was caught early\" lucky ? cancer? don't think so, think positive ? what else can we do ?sometimes feel so alone though.",
