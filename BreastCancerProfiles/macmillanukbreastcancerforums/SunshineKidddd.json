      "Content": "Hi all, I looked back on my cancer diary and saw that I first found a lump on the 21st of January last year. I'm having more chemo in February and it just hit me that it's been a year!! There's no real point to this just that my whole year of being 24 has been about cancer. It's just weird and I actually feel emotional about it which is new!!  Hope everyone is happy and well :) ",

      "Content": "Hi all, Firstly thank you all for replying it's sp comforting to know that however rubish things are, people like you make me get over myself, brush it off and think hpw lucky I am!! You are all amazing people!!  Young at heart I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend, I think it's great you take them with you in spirit on your travels. I get the 'you look so much better' now you can go clean the house, fix this and that ect I'm still so tired from chemo/ the major op, radiotherapy and have more chemo coming up, it's upsetting as I can't do what others want/expect.  I missed so much laat year like the last bit of uni where there was alot of social events and a trip. Family holiday to the lakes, gigs and concerts (I'm a musician so that was super runishj!!) So I think when I'm better I have alot of adventures to catch up on!!  Thank you again sorry for my moaning seasion there!! Wishing you all the best and thanks for the kind words too :)  Sunshine kid (Aimee)",
