    "Content": "Hi Lizzy, I was searching through the internet for answers to the same problem you had with your hair still falling out 4 weeks post FEC chemo. I am now 5 weeks post chemo, I used the cold cap and had 4 rounds of FEC. My hair is still falling out and I just wondered how you got on in the end. When it stopped shedding and started re-growing.Â  Did you use any supplements to help. I feel really down about it now and just want it to stop. Any help or advice you can give would be really appreciated. Thank you x",
