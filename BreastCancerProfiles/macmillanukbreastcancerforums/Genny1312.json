However life has changed somewhat with the onslaught of BC and as you say it is not just the chemo but the whole thing lack of exercise etc. For myself I suffered badly with pregnancy sickness and there seems to be a connection with that and chemo so I am always quite sick the day of treatment then nauseous for the next 7/9 days. I can control it pretty well with the anti sickness meds but also eating little and often whatever I fancy!! My poor husband has to make several trips to the shops to get my next demand!!

My family are great especially my husband,children and my mum & dad and they know that when all this is done I will be attempting to get back on track sounds like they have noticed ,I just mean they really don't want to see me worrying about my weight at this time so much more important for us all to get rid of this disease before we get back to our own normals. So Wendy you're not alone sounds like you carried a lot of extra fluid I do around my middle whilst on the steroids then it goes right down ( have just had chemo 5 so only day 4 so still on steroids so feel especially bloated!!) sounds like loosing the weight is down to finishing the chemo enjoy !!

      "Content": "Hi Syers, Just to say I had lumpectomy back in November with SN biopsy and axillary clearance with 1 positive node. I did all my exercises and my arm / breast area has healed well ( bit of a square looking breast with a nipple pointing to the right!! ) but hey ho all sorted. I still have pain from time to time especially with upper arm shoulder and back probably a lot to do with nerve endings being so involved so please don't worry perfectly normal. I had dissolvable sutures on top but of course what you can't see are sutures that are put in under the skin in layers. They can take up to 6/9 months to heal inside and in so doing can pull the tissues together so much that for some the area will appear quite lumpy again perfectly normal. I used bio oil on my suture areas breast and under arm when my scar was comfortable and gently massaged the area several times a day. Even if you are sitting you can gently massage the area on top of your clothes, just breaks up the tissues and prevents scar tissue forming ( the lumpy bits) Have a go takes a few weeks to notice any difference but it will work.   Also to say when you start chemo you may find you have pain again in the surgery areas again normal the chemo is just going around the body and will reach every part. Lots of positive wishes for Friday ,I have no. 5!! On Friday so nearly there as you will be soon all doable. Just ask as many questions as you want to the nurses are always keen to help and this forum is brilliant. Lots of love & hugs Genny xxx (by the way I am a nurse myself so advice has been well used in my career!!",

      "Content": "Hi Susie I feel for you I think we all get to the stage you are at and just want it all to end and normality to return. I too have finished chemo , I have to say the whole chemo experience for me was pants; every cycle I had I wasn't going to have another!! But when you reach that 3rd week you just know you must do it and do it I did. When it got to cycle 6 my ONC made the decision to stop (I had a chest pain episode the week before) I was totally taken aback I said really??!! Are you sure??!! But as he said he felt I had done enough with all the side effects etc and the risk of having no 6 for me outweighed any further benefit. So fab I was ecstatic and of course as he had made the decision I trusted him he is the expert.  So I guess what I'm saying is trust the experts they have been doing this a long time and they can only go on their huge experiences of treating patients. by the way I am a nurse so have some knowledge but still respect what the ONCs know. Also I had like you FEC all the way through and mine was 2cms stage 2 and had spread to 1 lymph node. I have had 3 rads so far a breeze compared to chemo and already chemo seems a long time ago .Look forward Susie take it day by day deal with it as you go and honestly you will get there that light is almost lit!! Chemo messes with your head and your emotions don't be so hard on yourself your entitled to feel as you do but honestly it will get better. lots of love &a good positive wishes Genny x",

      "Content": "Hi Denise!  Sorry just looking at posts now and saw your reply. We are very much the same except mine was not Herceptin positive so poor you your journey still very much going on. Sounds like you are doing everything to help get your life back on track although as we know life will never be quite as it was. I think take the positives and run with them. For instance we can be proud we have survived the arduous treatment and will carry on fighting the little blighters with anti hormones for 10 years no mean feat!! Another positive for me is losing my hair for me never an issue and I got to see how I look bald! Not too bad really and also got to wear a blonde wig fab my husband has always wanted a blonde wife! Showers in the morning are so quick too in some way I'm not looking forward to doing the hair drying pilava again!! The other huge positive is meeting so many lovely people both in hospital and on this forum. I know none of us really want to be here but as we are I think it is amazing great support for all of us even though some like me don't post as often it is great to read and get such reassurance from each other and we truly understand each other's feelings and worried. So yes life has changed for us all but there is a happy future out there that we all deserve and have worked so hard to get!! So as you say keep keeping on and keep in touch Big Hug Genny x",

I only work 15 hours a week so not too bad. I just know as soon as your back that's it you're expected to carry on and deal with everything so I'm not rushing.

      "Content": "Hi Carly i think you have had all the advice from the ladies above and would just like to tell you a little of my own experience which may also help. I agree the final decision has to be your  mother in laws but the more informed the better.  At  57 I was diagnosed with stage 2 with 1/11 lymph nodes affected. Was referred to as bog standard one to have!!(normally hate being bog standard but in this case I was more than happy!) the recommendation for me from there was lumpectomy,axillary clearance then radiotherapy and 10 years hormone treatment ( to me that's the worst part!)  So appointment with ONC with final results and discussion. There is another diagnostic test that was performed ,maybe your mother I law had,not sure what it is called but anyway it measures the speed of cell division of the cancer cell itself ,in other words how speedy the little devils are at multiplying! There are parameters that are ideal and mine was considerably higher than ideal. So the discussion!! The ONC said it would have been fairly clear for me to have surgery then RAD then hormone he felt the RAD would sufficiently kill off and sterilise the areas affected and would be happy if that was to be my decision .However he felt that given the result of the \"speed\" test and given my age (apparently quite young in chemo terms!) that I might opt for chemo. To me it was a no brainer( I am a nurse and just want the lot if on offer!) I opted for chemo . Soooooo now just had 2nd chemo yesterday. Everyone as you must know(midwife??) is different and chemo is not easy. Had to be admitted for the day after the first one as I had an allergic reaction to one of the meds and was very sick and nauseous but got much better after about day 10. So 2nd treatment adapted lots of anti sickness before and after had a syringe driver for 24 hours still nausea but nothing like last time much better. So what I'm trying to say is it can be adapted the medics really don't want you to suffer any more than you have to. My ONC also said he would be happy if I have at least 4 treatments so that may be the case. Sorry to have told you my life story!! Just feel it might help. For me it was the right decision,I would always have regretted it as it was offered but I do believe also the biggest protection for us hormone positive ladies is the dreaded hormones after. i wish you both the best decisions and hope it all goes really well. lots of love & positivity  Genny  ",

I am home now spent yesterday on a drip they tried everything and nothing seem to help much even the expensive drug Emend PeePee but I think it was too late I am sure all this is better to have pre chem. they did in fact give me more antis ness IV prior to chemo because of my history so I guess they tried. The last drug they gaveme was Levomepromazine which knocked me out totally evidently can do. They also were concerned about my flushed face chest and back thought I must have An allergy to the chemicals - haven't we all!   Home now and still feel lousy but have managed some dry toast so things are looking up!   good luck to all of you on the second cycle.

      "Content": "Hello lovely ladies!! Just lying in bed perusing the old posts and thought I would give you update after 2nd chemo. Much better ! The Onc removed one of the meds( said he thought that was the one causing the allergic reaction and wasn't particularly necessary for me (!!!!) ) I was given cyclizine & other anti sick prior to chemo I V and Emend by mouth all an hour before. After I had an syringe driver (battery operated pump) to go home with with cyclizine infusing for 24 hours. That is just put in under the skin in arm/tummy and it stayed in for 24 hrs. District nurse can remove or I did myself (they knew I am a nurse so couldn't get away with that one!) So I will have that each time now which has made a huge difference. Unfortunately didn't stop the nausea which kicked in exactly 2 hours after again But only 1 vomit rather than every hour and more controllable as I was able to manage som food to help. Now day 6 biggest problem constipation!!!! Something I never get!! I think it is all the cyclizine so that's my next challenge! Are so much home made soup full of veg and smoothies full of fruit seeds and loads of fluid yesterday that I think I overdid it soooooo uncomfortable !! Senna that hosp provide I have had 5 already so today should be explosive !!!! Anyway enough hilarity on a Sunday morning hope all you ladies doing well Love hugs  Genny",

I had a very pleasant experience for my first time nurses were all lovely didn't take as long as I had anticipated and was home by 2pm sorting out my new calendar. Then just 2 hours later I was overcome by awful nausea husband made me ginger tea took another anti sickness med but nothing was going to stop the first projectile vomit!! and it has continued every hour. Obviously cant sleep feel awful I think nausea and vomiting is the worst thing for me I think I can cope with the rest of what is to come but this is miserable. I hear there is a connection to pregnancy sickness and they asked me today if I had suffered that and I did severely so obviously true. I will ring hospital tomorrow and see if they can give me yet more meds! Have any of you had this so quickly and can you suggest anything?  Thanks for listening here we go again!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ",

      "Content": "Hello to all you lovely friends just needed to share with you that I've had enough!!! Chemo no. 5 last Friday usual routine (for me!) sickness nausea sickness bed,24 hours anti- sickness syringe into my tummy this time as arm developed a hard lump then wake up and off we go again. Next few days not too bad in the sense that once syringe removed the anti sick meds seemed to control things quite well then CONSTIPATION!!!!!!! Happens every time and I'm sure we all get it but this time despite the sennaside(!!) it seemed worse. My main problem is drinking, cannot even stand water when I've just had chemo so I try everything but I know that is probably the main reason. So basically I have developed a nasty tear ( anal fissure) and it is sooooooo painful. i am eating fruit/ veg all things that will help but being nauseous a lot I have to have what I fancy and can tolerate and take the nasty taste away. I feel I have done pretty well getting this far(5) and am very tempted to stop at 5 I just feel I can't stand this change in my otherwise normal life for much longer.  Can anyone suggest something to soften my stool( of course I could go to the GP but I'd like to try first) I am putting sudocrem on the sore area (well that's hit & miss can't see what I'm doing and the extra stone in weight certainly isn't helping!!!) So you see I've just about had it I made the decision to go with chemo even though it only gave me an extra 3% reduced risk of return I suppose I feel I've done more than I needed to but will I regret not taking that last one.........HELP!!!

I am 57 and hair like most of us very important(bad hair  day the worst for me shallow/!!) Had a very lovely persuasive nurse encouraged me to try cap sized me for treatment day 5th Jan. Have a lovely close friend diagnosed stage 4 ovarian cancer 6 years ago also persuaded me. She has used every time with great results-hair different texture to mine very fine stylish and always has looked fab thinner for sure but fab. Husband amazed I agreed to try as I had researched myself and spoken  to many friends who have gone through it (!!) most were negative. As a nurse myself who is very passionate about people and care, I understood exactly where this lovely nurse was coming from so I felt I could not say no, so agreed to try However home thinking, conditioner prior to treat ,conditioner after treat ,prolonged coldness, unable to wash hair for 3 days etc. all seemed familiarly unappealing. Cancelled cap prior to 1st session on 5th. Lovely nurses still tried when I went for treatment! Wig app also prior to first treat, wigs quite impressive she was also negative about cap as she said you will prob still need a wig as it will thin. My hairdresser said she will tweek and it will look great. So for me I am happy with my choice, for me-it is so individual and it must be your choice I love to wear hats and suggestions on the forum are great and I think I will find it easier going out and about looking tidy and hopefully still stylish in my new wig. Also when I eventually return to work (goodness knows when that will be as I am in health cant do) I don't want to stand out with a new very short haircut well at least not straight away! also bonus get a few wigs or at least one more for fun! I will and wear it out with your friends or hubby could be the romance you both need when he looks at you ,and in my case he will be looking at Cher (long dark fringed wig(!!!) then the spark might still be there!!! Anyway waffling now being so careful not to press wrong button. Good luck Jayne and all Just before I finish to say after 1st treat some may have seen brief post from me had extreme reaction back into hosp horrible totally dehydrated covered in red rash etc not to be repeated! I think if I had to endure all of that the conditioned manky hair would have been the last straw!! I am now day 5 and managed mashed potato and chocolate great combo and lemon curd(never in the house ) husband dashed to get! So on the up!! Sorry bit garbled I hope some makes sense Good luck to us all xxx",

      "Content": "Hello to all you lovely friends just needed to share with you that I've had enough!!! Chemo no. 5 last Friday usual routine (for me!) sickness nausea sickness bed,24 hours anti- sickness syringe into my tummy this time as arm developed a hard lump then wake up and off we go again. Next few days not too bad in the sense that once syringe removed the anti sick meds seemed to control things quite well then CONSTIPATION!!!!!!! Happens every time and I'm sure we all get it but this time despite the sennaside(!!) it seemed worse. My main problem is drinking, cannot even stand water when I've just had chemo so I try everything but I know that is probably the main reason. So basically I have developed a nasty tear ( anal fissure) and it is sooooooo painful. i am eating fruit/ veg all things that will help but being nauseous a lot I have to have what I fancy and can tolerate and take the nasty taste away. I feel I have done pretty well getting this far(5) and am very tempted to stop at 5 I just feel I can't stand this change in my otherwise normal life for much longer.  Can anyone suggest something to soften my stool( of course I could go to the GP but I'd like to try first) I am putting sudocrem on the sore area (well that's hit & miss can't see what I'm doing and the extra stone in weight certainly isn't helping!!!) So you see I've just about had it I made the decision to go with chemo even though it only gave me an extra 3% reduced risk of return I suppose I feel I've done more than I needed to but will I regret not taking that last one.........HELP!!!

      "Content": "Hi Lee Just read your post and thought I would also give you a little more positivity! It is such a daunting journey for all of us from start to finish but the start is always the worst,once you get into it you will find that time will just fly by,honestly!!  I was diagnosed last November with ER+8 and PR+8 invasive BC with small high grade DCIS but HER neg. I had WLEand axillary clearance with 1/11 positive. My plan of treatment was to be radiotherapy then 10 years hormone treatment. Then the oncologist explained about chemo and the fact that I was borderline would be a good idea to have to mop up any cells and to hugely reduce my risk of it coming back ,but also the hormone treatment would be my biggest protection. He then worked out on the NHS Predict tool based on age etc ( 57) that my risk was 3% better if I had chemo than not . I then asked for the result of another test ( can't remember what it's called!) which measures the speed the cancer cells divide ,the oncologist said the level he would be happy with is 13 and mine came in at 24 so as you can see not much higher but still speedier than is desirable. Because of that and the fact that I had a better outcome in my eyes and my husbands it was a no brainer I opted for chemotherapy. I can't say chemo is an easy journey and certainly different for everyone Lee but honestly so worth it for your peace of mind and future. I have just had chemo no. 5 ( Friday) and very proud of myself as it has for me been quite hard at times but so pleased I have carried on and my next will be the last!!  This forum is fab and you can read so many great honest stories and of course occasionally there is a story of secondary cancer which really makes you think; sometimes chemo was maybe not recommended or perhaps chosen and so unfortunately has reoccurred very hard to deal with. I also have 2 friends who had breast cancer 7 years ago and not offered chemo and it has now returned. I really don't want to worry or alarm you but all of this has really helped me to realise the choice I made was the right one. I think as you are HER positive you will be recommended to have it really think hard it is so so important for you to be happy with your decision but keep reading the stories here and I think you will be inspired by all these great ladies and men(!!) who post. Really it is all very doable just feels life has changed for a bit but I'm sure you can do it and we are all behind you!!! So enough rambling ( chemo brain kicks in quite quickly you'll soon find out! makes you a bit daft and forgetful nothing new there for me!!)    Sending you lots of positive thoughts for big decisions  Genny",

      "Content": "Hi Leen just before I switch the light off thought I'd do a quick reply. The Oncotype is the test that is not available for everyone so yes you may be right it may be for HER+ I don't know,but my ONC said it was not worth me paying £2500!! To have it as he still felt more in favour of me having the chemo as 1 node affected and the cell division was a bit higher than desirable. I think had I said no he would have accepted that but me(also being a nurse and fearing the worst !!!) made the decision to go for it and I am really pleased that I did. It is much harder when you are given the choice you just really want them to make the decision but I figured this was my best shot and may as well get it all covered at this stage. good luck with the next few weeks but once they are over with and you have your plan honestly it will get easier.

After that I was given IV anti sickness Cyclizine and steroid IV also oral Emend. I then went home with a syringe pump into my arm or tummy with Cyclizine administered over 24 hrs. After that it comes out. Alongside I had all the other drugs that have been mentioned already and I can say my vomiting and nausea was managed better however I suffered every time . So I can say ask for everything you can if it helps even a little that is something. I did get a bit sorry for myself as a lot of others having the same treatment did not have the horrid nausea that you and I have had.  Stick with it lovie I finished chemo 6 weeks ago and am now into next stage rads a doddle in comparison well so far!!! So lots of love I kept thinking as I was feeling so awful the poison was doing a really good job !! Xxx",

( this is a great place to be when you can't sleep always someone around to chat/listen) All of us on here have been where you are now and so appreciate how hard it is , we are with you and will support you all the way ; it is a great site with a lot of expertise and experience and you will soon find on this journey you will be posting others to help them. When you have a plan everything will be clearer in your mind, try to take someone with you as it is always difficult to hear and take all the information in at this stage but nobody will rush you so ask as much as you want to. Honestly this is the hardest time the waiting and not knowing specifics. You sound like a very grounded pragmatic lady who will cope well with a support network around you. Like you I have a job ( nurse) where I constantly look after and treat other people so when something like this happens to us it is in many ways alien as we are then on the other side!! I'm sure everyone on here feels like that though for me at times it is very surreal. But hey ho we have to just do what is offered and we will beat this very very very common disease!! i have just had chemo No5 and really the time has  zoomed by; and I will have radiotherapy followed by hormone treatment. So I'm nearly there and all the stuff in between you can do I have( by the way I am 57!) keep strong keep posting and we are here for you. Better get back to my book try a few more chapters !! From the start of my treatment I have adopted the spare room so my husband can sleep and I can do what a want marvellous!!! Sending lots of positive vibes & hugs Genny x  ",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah I am going through rads now , I have 5 more to go and have also asked about anti perp/deodorant as my hospital (Southampton) say that we are fine to carry on using it. The reason they give is to do with research and apparently there is no evidence to say that not wearing it is any more beneficial to treatment. But I agree there should be some standard set so we all did the same regardless of where we are being treated. It is confusing for us all when we are given conflicting information especially as it's our recovery and futures they are dealing with! What I can say though is my rads is getting through as my skin is very  red and sunburnt looking and the nipple area is especially sensitive. When I asked what to put on it I was told they are not allowed to recommend anything to us but if I was using Aloe Vera Gel then I should carry on!! Honestly as if we didn't have enough to worry about without working out what we should put on our sore skin ! I also had lymph nodes removed last November and the area is still very numb and I sometimes get pain which can be very sharp in the upper arm. I just massage it gently and it passes; I suppose it takes a long time for nerves to heal and knit back together so we will probably experience odd pains from time to time. The rads disturbs everything again and these symptoms apparently last for several weeks following the end of treatment. Oh it's all such fun eh??!!!  Hope we it all settles for you soon Sarah we are all learning sooooooo much!!!( none of it we ever wanted to know!!) love Genny x",

      "Content": "Hi June  Welcome to the best most fabulous supportive and knowledgeable forum imaginable! I am fairly new to this like you but have now become hooked!! You have had some great advice so far and so I can only reiterate all the above and just give you a comparison with my story. Like you I have a grade 2 BC for which I had a lumpectomy and 1 positive lymph node leading to axillary clearance( only 1 out of 11 lymph nodes removed was positive good news but still requiring removal) We all have a different amount of lymph glands removed depends really on how much of a \"scoop\" your surgeon makes which is why we all quote different numbers. We can easily survive without these glands we have plenty of others throughout our body!! All of us without exception have an increased risk of developing lymph oedema just because we have had a bundle removed small price to pay for peace of mind I think. The other ladies have explained about looking after your arm to avoid any problems all doable.  Like you I am a very healthy fit person and at 57 very active young(!!) passioate nurse- ironically spending 8 years of my career visiting corporate companies with my breast and testicle models!!! I would talk to individuals about their general health and talk about various cancers. With my rubber models I would demonstrate breast examination and awareness and also testicular awareness ( always hilarious as most men are very aware of their testicles but not in that way!!) it felt so worthwhile passing on my knowledge and expertise and little did I know that some years later I too have become one of those 1 in 8 statistics. Just being a woman and producing the hormones we produce makes  us as females a high risk . No point trying to find any other reason June it is nothing you or any of us have done we are just that statistic.  So I have had my first chemo 5/1 ( one test that is done when the cancer cells are looked at is how quickly the little blighters divide and grow in my case they were speedy little growers which is why chemo was recommended). I am now day 12 and really back to normal( whatever that is!!) bit roller coasters can't lie but basically you just have to go with it rest as much as you need and take every offer of help and support that you can. Sounds like you have some great friends let them help. My advice to you June whilst waiting is to prepare what you can for the weeks ahead. Create a sanctuary in your bedroom treat yourself to some new bed linen line up some gorgeous music to relax to good book etc . Make sure you have plenty in the freezer to tempt you after .  Make use of this fab forum 24/7 you can't go wrong and very soon you will find yourself posting and helping someone just like us!! lots of love and positive vibes xxx",

Chemo finished in April then rads 23 sessions (8 targeted as part of a trial ) finished 4 weeks ago. Almost journey's end!! You asked about Tamoxifen ; my oncologist started me on it after chemo but he did not prescribe it he wrote to my GP with an update and I then had to chase the GP for the prescription. I have been taking it now for over 2 months with little side effects the only one being slight nausea in the morning after taking it with breakfast so I have switched to taking it at night which seems better. I suggest you phone ur GP and chase them for a prescription then you can get going. I found I just wanted to get on with it as I felt psychologically that I was almost finished and now I am!! So good luck and keep asking questions this forum is great and the knowledge from people is invaluable. Lots of lov  Genny x",
