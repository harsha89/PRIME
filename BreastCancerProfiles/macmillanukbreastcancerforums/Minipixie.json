    "Content": "This reply has helped me so much! I have exactly the same and was feeling so disheartened. I said it feels like labour pains in a sense. Yucky tummy sore and bloated and food just seems pointless.Â  This chemo malarkey, I'm so over it now. Love the good days though! And counting it down now. Two more to go. Good luck with the rest of your treatment jackster31! Big hugs! Thank you toxophilite for helping me too",
