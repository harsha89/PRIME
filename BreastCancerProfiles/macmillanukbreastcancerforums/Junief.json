      "Content": "Hello. I wonder if any of you helpful Ladies have suffered a rise in your heart rate during your chemo treatment?   I had my 1st FEC chemotherapy 2 weeks ago and have subsequently been suffering from a rise in my heart rate - which I have not experienced prior to this.  I saw a Cardiologist and wore a 24 hour monitor to be told today that my average BPM is 98 (normal is 70 bpm). He suggests that this is high and the 'likely' cause is due to me being low, fatigued etc. from the chemo.  I have to go for an Echo scan next week to check all is working well with my heart.   Just something else to worry about! Thanks for listening. Junie x",
