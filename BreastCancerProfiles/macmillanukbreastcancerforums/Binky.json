      "Content": "Can I just add that there are some amazingly good wigs out there. I have two by Rene of Paris, and you cannot tell that they are wigs. The trick is to match it closely with your own style for shape and colour, then get your hairdresser to tweak the fringe a bit. Makes a bespoke wig almost. I wear allsorts at home - au naturel, bandanas, beanies and of course the wigs. Depends on weather; if it's cold/rainy , then on with the wigs. So nice and warm if you wear the little cap underneath. Go to the wedding with confidence and have great time - it will do you good to be at such a happy occasion.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy 5 days ago and the doctor said that I would need radio therapy when the wounds have healed. Does anyone have experience of this and can tell me:- (a) does it irritate the skin (b) should you apply any lotion, cream or oil before/after the treatment and (c) where there any unwanted side effects?",
