      "Content": "Hi.... The journey we are all on is not an easy one but in my experience I went into survival mode and that was my way of coping. My tumour was picked up in a routine mammogram and they say I'd had it for around 6 months with no symptoms whatsoever. Due to finding it early I was lucky enough not to have chemo so I had WLI and Sentinal node biopsy followed by 15 sessions of Radiotherapy and Hornone treatment for 5 years. The burning and pains you are having will be trauma from the surgery nerve endings being cut and with time it will ease. Good luck with your appointment next week and whatever they throw at you, you will get through . I found being open and honest with my family as to how I was and am feeling was best for me. Good luck xx",

I am 15 months post surgery and 12 months post rads and still coping with the after effects. My Surgeon prescribed Anastrozole Accord brand  as my hormone treatment which I've been taking for 14 months the side effects have subsided except for the  joint pain which I take low dose pain killers for. I intend to carry on taking them to give myself the best chance I can. good luck with your rads and for the future keep fighting x",
