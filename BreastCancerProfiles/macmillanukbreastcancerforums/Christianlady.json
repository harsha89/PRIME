    "Content": "Hi In my opinion everything you have mentioned are pretty much the same what you would get from NHS. Though the funding is lacking with my experience they have been really thorough with me from prior to diagnosis to now.  I am Oestrogen neg, progesterone neg but my HER2 is positive. I have been having my chemo in the last 3 weeks and going well without side effects that bothers me just very few minir things.  My chemo drug is paclitaxel (taxol) weekly IV and 3 weekly Herceptin (trastuzumab) for a year.  As HER2 is a fast growing and fast spreading cancer cell my oncologist has to ensure that my cancer will not come back.  Trust the medical team who are looking after you. Tgey will not try and do short cuts due to funding. Theur interest is your well being and for you to get better. Tgere are many leaflets and other reading materials that tge hospital offers. Read tgem and try to ask questions if something is not quite right. Get them to explain to you. You will have peace of mibd and you are in goid hands.  I will pray for you.  God bless Christianlady",
