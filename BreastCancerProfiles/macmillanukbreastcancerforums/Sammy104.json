      "Content": "Someone suggested to me to buy fake lashes, don't bother, ever tried to put fake ones on without the eyelashes to guide you? Impossible to get them straight! Didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the time, now mine are all grown back I can see the funny side, but thought I would just pass this on in case anyone else is as stupid as me! Anyone for a pair of unused false eyelashes?!",

      "Content": "I had the same problem after chemo, fine downy hair on face, like an overdue baby! Thought it was awful, but after a couple of months it started to go and now 10 months on am back to 'normal' all gone, so don't be tempted to wax, no need. Just another joy to get through! But much easier to deal with than some of the others, just don't look in the mirror, and if anyone dares to comment, sure you can think of an answer!",

      "Content": "Hi Mandip, I know we are all different, but don't get too worked up about it, I did, as my best friend  ( of 50 years) got taken off it, as on her second one she had a blinding headache, and they thought she had a brain tumour, so I was very dubious to say the least! BUT, I am now on number  12 of 18 is it? Anyway a year and so far, touch wood, have had no problems at all, go in have the injection in my leg, wait for an hour or so, depending on what else I have to do, and leave, feeling the same as I did when I went in and nothing changes at all. So think positive, do,as they say, 4 hours I think the first time, and hopefully you will sail through it. Suex",
