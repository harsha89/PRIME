    "Content": "Hi Janice I know exactly what you mean about the roller coaster ...I am having the mx the same day as you.  Next week I am having a sentinel node biopsy to see if cancer has spread to the nodes.  I am keen to have an immediate re-con as I really don't think I am strong enough emotionally and psychologically to deal with post op without a re-con.  Surgeon is pushing towards I think its called ld back flap.  I asked about an implant but that seemed to be very quickly disposed of as an option.  The reason given was that over time my 'good' breast will drop and the other one wouldn't!!   Does anyone have any ideas???",
