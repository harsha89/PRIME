    "Content": "Hello all.. I have just joined this site today and have lots of questions... some that probably cant be answered but I would be really grateful for any advice. On the 4th October I was urgently refererred to the Breast clinic.. I had a mammogram- ultrasound where they found 2 lumps and the radiologist got concerned about a \"mass\" that she also found near my armpit.. I have been having breast pain for some time now. The consultant did a core needle biopsy of the lumps that were found but tests proved inconclusive so I have to have a double biopsy on Friday :-((. I was managing ok up to this point until the senior sister called me back in before I had my biopsy and said that \"they are quite worried about you Sandra, how are you feeling\" this threw me a bit because I wasnt prepared to be asked this :-)I'm finding the waiting is driving me crazy plus lack of sleep.. I would be really appreciative if any ladies/men could offer any ways of distraction. Many thanks xxx",
