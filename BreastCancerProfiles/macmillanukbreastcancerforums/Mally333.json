      "Content": "Hi I do have to admit I find myself having a bit of a chuckle reading these posts. I'm experiencing word for word the exact same. My wife and I separated 18 months ago, before I was diagnosed with cancer, I choose to have my three 18 year old kids (2 boys and a girl triplets) live with me. Even though they can be a pain in the ass ( most of the time) not one day goes by when I think how things would have been if I had let the mother stay with them instead of me, just having them here and them doing ball all, means the world to me and, I can say with all honesty I would be in a very dark place without them. I do turn the internet off now and again when they over step the mark.ha ha. Regards Mally",
