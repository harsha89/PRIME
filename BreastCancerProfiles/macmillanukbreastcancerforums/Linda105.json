      "Content": "Hi Anne reading your and other posts about returning to work I though I would share my experience. I had my first chemo on 9 Dec and in the grand scheme of things coped well with the side effects to the point where I went back to work week two. I quickly got back into my long hours culture working full days and commuting into London, running around on buses, late meetings and getting wet in the awful weather. By the Friday of that week I had picked up an infection, high temperature and spent the next three days in hospital on IV antibiotics. I have probably learnt the hard way in thinking I'm OK I can do this! But it has made me think more about working particularly during week two. I had my second chemo yesterday (hence the early post due to the fact I can't sleep!) and I have been given daily injections from day 7 to 14 to boost my WBC to hopefully stop me getting further infections. Am I thinking about going into work - yes - but I am thinking of shorter hours to miss the worst of the commute and also a laptop to work from home. Like others on here I too am career driven and I want to be at work but others are right and I need to pay attention and do the right thing for me. As do you and hopefully my experience is a guide to perhaps what not to do! Whatever you decide I wish you all the best. Linda",

      "Content": "Many thanks for your reply, it's intersting that you mention my throat as both visits to the hospital are throat related the second visit I had tonsillitis. I am seeing my oncologist on Thursday and she did mention briefly that if I continue to be neutropenic after each session they may consider stopping treatment so hopefully she will discuss this with me when I see her. Hopefully I might have just been unlucky! Linda    ",

      "Content": "Hi I'm currently going through my second round of chemo and I'm looking for some advice. I am receiving FEC and for both sessions I have become neutropenic and spent time in hospital. This is despite having daily WBC injections from day 7 to 14 on the second session. I was wondering whether this is common and whether anyone has experienced the same. Also any advice on what I need to be thinking about and discussing with my oncologist in preparation for my next session would be welcome. Thanks Linda  ",

      "Content": "Hi JJ2 Many thanks for your reply. It sounds like you have been through the mill! and so far my experience is very similar to yours. Sensitivity was mentioned but no reduction to the strength was made on my second session. Mention was also made of stopping treatment if I continue to end up in hospital after each treatment and it looks as though the injections were the first intervention to try to stop infections. Alternative treatments were not discussed but I guess they wanted to see how I reacted to the second session as it may be that I was just unlucky on the first.   I'm not sure about undergoing further treatments if this is likely to happen after each session. A discussion with my oncologist I think!
