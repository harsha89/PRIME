    "Content": "Hi Amy, Hope this isn't repeated, I typed it out but something went wrong!.. Anyway, I've had two mastecotmy ops and both times I found that leggings and a long button through top were the easiest, the drains can go through between buttons (if you have drains) and I used a very small backback to keep them in, the amount of times I got up and forgot about them...ouch! Easy pull on leggings rather than jeans, anything you can do without having to really 'pull' is best. You will have movement still but will be stiff and sore and you need to be careful so no pull on stuff.  I've got full use of both arms now after both of min but will admit my left arm is still struggling but that's from the Sentinal Node Biopsy. Don't ever think any question is silly, it isn't....that's what this is here for. Good luck with your op, I hope all goes well for you and a speedy recovery... Marie xx amy66 Hi everyone I go into hospital next Thursday night ready for my mastectomy/ANC on Friday. I hope this doesn't sound like a daft question, but what is the best stuff to take to put on when I leave bearing in mind the drain etc? Also am I OK wearing jeans or better with something that doesn't take much fastening or effort to put back on? I have no idea of what to expect in terms of movement in my arm, it's my right side and I'm right handed.   Sorry if these sound like silly questions but I'd be very grateful for any advice/practical tips. Thank you xxx ",
