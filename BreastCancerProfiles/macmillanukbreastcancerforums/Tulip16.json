      "Content": "Hi Katiepie,  I've been a member of this community since March, but don't often post much as I feel there are ladies with far more greater issues than me which makes me feel a little bit of a fraud. However, had my planning meeting for 15 radiotherapy sessions yesterday to start May 17. The point of this post is when arriving at reception I was told they weren't expecting me until next week. Thankfully I had taken my appt letter with me which clearly stated I had the right time and day. Whilst waiting for someone come and talk to me, I felt myself beginning to wobble which confused me as I've been so positive about having BC up until now. Eventually someone came to talk to me at which point I burst into tears, I was completely floored by my reaction, I guess my emotions finally got the better of me. Like you I'll be joining the May group. I also got a negative response about R1 & R2 just told to use my usual moisturiser as long as it didn't contain 'sodium lauryl sulphate' (SLS) and same with deodorant. The only thing I was told not to do was shave, wax or use hair remover on the underarm on that side, and don't over moisturise (twice a day was fine) otherwise carry on as normal. I have brought Aveeno and have already started the a routine but also thinking of getting Aloe Vera from Holland and Barrett and putting it in the fridge as has been suggested by others for the cooling effect to use after each session. I'm beginning to get really anxious about side effects as I'll still be having sessions leading up to and beyond my son's wedding. Just hope that any side effects are manageable so that it doesn't spoil the day.  Hope your 'zaps' as they are called, go well. Soon there will be light at the end of this tunnel.  Love and hugs Tulip16 xxx",

Feel for you as these are big decisions, I have decided to have another go with fingers crossed.  Unfortunately only you can make this decision so whatever you decide (and I'm sure you'll make the right one for you) I wish you well and send my love.

      "Content": "Thank you so much lovely ladies, I've taken your advice and spoke to my RT nurse this morning who kindly fitted me in in her lunch hour, bless her. She gave me some special dressings to help with the nipple problem and told me how to carry on until such time the symptoms start to improve, which she seems to think should be just around the corner as she is certain I've now peaked with the side effects - hooray!! Told me to forget what my doctor prescribed especially after his comment that he THOUGHT it was a RADIATION RASH - well blow me down who would have guessed..........!!! For everyone about to or have just started RT, I wish you well with your treatment and any side effects are minimal. Love Tulip16 xxxxx",

      "Content": "I've not been online for some time, been rather busy going backwards and forward for zaps. Then my sons wedding in the middle of zaps, which was lovely and managed the day better than I thought I would. Have to say got away with very little side effects until about the 12th one when a red raised rash appeared, which was amazingly itchy, sore and painful along with a very sensitive nipple. Treated it with hydrocortisone cream, took piriton along pain killers as advised by the hospital and continued with plenty of moisturiser and drank loads of water. It's now over 2 weeks since I finished and still suffering even after going to my doctors who gave Dermol 500, which I can't say I've notice much improvement. Have hit a few walls of tiredness but nothing much to complain about. Am I making a fuss by asking the radiotherapy nurse for some advice or wait and see if things improve? I know we can still cook for a further 2 weeks after and need to keep up the moisturising and water regime or am I being impatient? Or am I'm feeling sorry for myself? Sorry to bleep on Tulip16 xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I see there is a discussion for Clinical Oncology, which has prompted me to ask this question. Here's a brief background - I go for results for a second WLE to get clear margins on Wednesday - another waiting game. My understanding at my last meeting with my surgeon which was pre second op, was that if the margins are not clear it would be a mastectomy (without radiotherapy) because of it being a high grade DCIS and 45mm and I was ER Negative (0/8). So I've been preparing myself for the outcome of this second WLE when I get two appt letters, one for this weeks appt and the other to see a Medical oncologist the following week.  So my question is what's the difference between the two types of oncologists? I thought a Medical onc dealt with chemo and other drugs or have I got this totally wrong and overthinking it with what they might be going to tell me on Wednesday ? I joined this site back in March and have posted a few posts but have been reading all the posts from afar, as I don't feel up to speed on things and I try to stay away from Dr Google as so many of you advise. I hoping someone will be able to help with my question.  Sorry for rambling but feeling uptight and anxious AGAIN......... Hugs to everyone going through this nightmare xxx",
