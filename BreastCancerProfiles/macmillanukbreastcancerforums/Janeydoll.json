      "Content": "Sorry you've found yourself here, but we're all with you on this journey and will listen and help with all we can.  I have found this site a wonderful support.  As with going privately for treatment,  I did just that. I was misdiagnosed initially by the NHS and I needed to speak to someone else.  I'm glad I did it.  I didn't lose my NHS BCN either because they don't just write you off like that, it's classed as neglect if they do. I gained a better personal experience and I'm glad I did it. You'll know what to do when the time comes, sometimes I just couldn't manage if I thought too far into the future.  Take care of yourself  xxx ",

I have a son who is 8 and he could not wait to see my bald head!  I think that's the difference between boys and girls! I'm sure your daughter will be fine with it. I had shoulder long hair that started to come away on Day 10 of my first FEC and I had to have it all cut off as my scalp was so sore I couldn't get it shaved . I'm hoping like you that by summer they'll be a bit of coverage , but I would have never had a different style in my life.  I love those little pixie cuts , it might not suit me but I can't wait to have a go !! Hope you're doing ok chick .... it's a comfort to know we all feel the same  xx",

It is normal to get the pain there, as where the surgery was has not completely healed.  Hope you feel better soon. It is quite painful but it does ease with time xxx ",
