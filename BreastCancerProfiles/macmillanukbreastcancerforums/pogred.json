      "Content": "Been to see my lovely breast nurse who was very positive about what I should and shouldn't do. She was very much in favour of keeping on with things but being cautious. Karate is ok but no contact and see how the sailing goes. Feeling much better about the whole thing and just looking forward to getting it over with on Friday. Thanks for all the comments they have been a great help.",

      "Content": "Hi All, I've had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy three weeks ago. I've now been told that the lump has gone totally but the first of the nodes showed cancerous cells. They now want to remove all of the other nodes. I don't know what to expect - how long will I be in for? How is it post-op? Any advice or comments greatly appreciated. Just to add to the fun it's triple negative so no hormone therapy just chemo. Feeling a bit gut kicked here as they told me it had been caught early so I was hoping that they'd got it all with no nodes but not to be.  Thanks  Sue x",

My friend who comes to visit armed with a hot flask of homemade soup and some fresh rolls from the posh bakery. My older retired male friend who posts funny videos and pictures on my Facebook to make me laugh and he has promised to take me out for a run in the car on my good weeks after I start chemo. My wonderful new Mac mates who know when to listen and are full of good ideas, advice and cyber hugs when needed. ",
