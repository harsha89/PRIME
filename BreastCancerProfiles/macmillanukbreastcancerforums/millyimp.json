      "Content": "Hello Jenny, I fully understand where you are coming from at the moment ,and your head will indeed be all over the place. I too was diagnosed 6 weeks ago,I was given the good news one week,that it is the hormone type I have ,it has spread to my sternum,and a couple of spots on my lung. I say good news because the letrozole I am on is controlling it .Then the following week we got the news they had found a lump in my bowel,which they thought was a primary bowel cancer. I had the colonoscopy ,done within 2 days my consultant asked for me to be telephoned straight away,the news was and still is brilliant, it is not cancer ,it is a begine polyp,which they want to remove in a couple of months time . So please do try not to jump to conclusions as we all do tend to do ,it could be your result comes back as mine did . I do hope so for you , Take Care Milly xx",

      "Content": "Hello to you all, I too just recently joined this breast group,Having been diagnosed with Breast Cancer 3 weeks ago.I am a Lady  aged 78,my husband is a Gentleman aged 83. My husband and my whole family were really shocked ,and told me how proud they were of me ,and of how I was coping. I have to admit I did astound myself with how I felt ,and seemed to be doing so well . I had the usual tests,mamogram,Ultra sound Scan.Core Biopsy, blood test ,and the CT scan. Waited for the results ,which I got and al seemed good,as the consultant said he would prescribe me Letrozone,this will not remove or cure ,but it will control. Then I had a full bone scan,that and the ct  scan were both abnormal.the breast cancer was also in the sternum,and a couple of spots in the lung. Again the Letrozole will deal with this as it is breast related. However there is also a lump in the colon ,at this point they do not know if it is a primary cancer or not.Once again I am in one mans land  of the unknown.Waiting for further test (camera)which I am told is nothing to be afraid of  as you are sedated ,and remember nothing about it after it . I was doing ok and we were all coming to terms with the Breast Cancer,now this has once again knocked us all for six. Till yesterday I was going along ok, yesterday I was happy and feeling postive ,today I am feeling the complete opposite,and weepy and so negative.(in tears when my husband is out of the room) .They are all trying to be so supportive for me ,I have tried to be strong for my husband and family ,but today I feel unable to be so .but still put on a face . To be able to talk with someone who is going through the same as me, and through the same stages I am at the moment ,could be so helpful, in taking the load from my husband and family. I would greatly appreciate someone being the same as myself and feeling the same way ,to be in touch.My tummy is going off and on(meaning  some discomfort sometimes with the feeling of needing the toilet ). I used to have this before ,so maynot due to the letrozole tablets,and poss just due to wind,as I do tend to make a lot ordinarily(sorry about this info) Sincerely Millyimp1322",

      "Content": "Hello to , JacqulineON, Mistymoley,and maggie may, Thank you all for your help,advice and information  along with all your kind words. Re side affects,I am not having any due to the Letrozole itself, Jacquline,what  I am having is the itching and soreness due to the location, and it being an open sore on the outside of my breast and under my arm. ,which the Nurse and my consultant said  would probably be eased by the antibiotic .But this hasn`t helped much ,they also say it is the healing that is taking place that is causing the itch and the location being the cause of the soreness. I have always believed this to be true,that when a wound itches it means it is also healing ,so I tend to try and accept the itching .The wind and discomfort I have ,I have had for many years now ,also the discomfort in the sternum ,so I know it is not a side affect of the Letrozole Tablets they have prescribed for me. I feel it has more to do with the stress of all this over the past 3 weeks ,then the latest curve ball on Tues ,that today has caused me to have the upset tummy, which would normally not have bothered me in this way,it would not have made me weepy ,as it did today .But I do appreciate your comments .And many thanks for your lovely hug and X ,they are always so welcome. Helen, It is hard yes indeed ,as I said to Jacquline re the Letrozole ,I know the wind /discomfort is not due to the letrozole medication.. So I am accepting of the treatment for the breast cancer,it is being in the land of the unknown yet again after just beginning to get our heads around that ,to find I now might also have primary cancer in the colon,and treatment for that to deal with.At this moment it does just feel too much to deal with in a positive way ,hence me feeling how I do at the moment.Thank you for telling me ,we are allowed to have down days ,you are so right ,and I must try and allow myself to have them. Maggie may, I do feel my nerves are being torn to shreds yes it is a most  nerve wracking time ,having just got the first lot of results  out of the way,and now find myself waiting yet again for more ,telling me whether or not it is what they believe it to be (primary cancer in the colon) or whether it is not ,and if it is then the treatment for it .Yes my emotions are all over the place,I will certainly keep posting in here  ,and once again thank all three of you for your kind replies. Take Care Milly",

      "Content": "Hello, I am a lady aged 78 years of age,I was diagnosed 4 weeks ago yesterday with Breast Cancer,it has also spread to the Sternum,and a couple of spots in the lungs. We were just coming to terms with that diagnosis ,when one week later I was told there is a lump in my colon,at the moment it is not known if this is cancer or not. This really shook us up,and now have to go to see another consultant to see what he says about the Lump.I was doing ok till yesterday when I got the App date,this has now greatly affected me ,in as much as I am shaking ,and so wound up it is unbelieveable. For the first time since the diagnosis 4 weeks ago I broke down in front of my lovely husband,I had tried all the time to just shed a few tears in private ,this morning I could no longer do that . I am Letrozole,as the above poster mentions,taking one per day,having the flushes yes, but more than that is the itching I have. My concern at the moment is to find a nutritionst ,as when on Letrozole it is adviceable not to have soya ,which is in almost every food and drink. The bread I eat has soya flour in ,all pastries etc have soya flour in them ,so please cam some kind soul help me out with what you can eat and drink that doesn`t have this in .It is said soya is the worst culprit and it also has the oestrogen ,which goes against the use of Letrozole. Thank you in advance Millyimp1322",
