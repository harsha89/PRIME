      "Content": "Hi worried, hate to be the barer of bad news but for me yes I have gained about a stone. I lost it during the RT and i was feeling great back to 12 st again now im 13 again. and its all around my middle I hate it as my legs have slimmed and arms but its all around my belly. I am re joining the gym this month to see if i can tone up. I am 45 So i will never be a super model size, althou when i was in my 20 30s i was size 10 12. I think the sheer fact Tamoxifen makes you go into Menopause if you are not already ads to it, I would not say I eat more, I just feel more tired as not sleeping and sweating like a pig and so then in the day i do \" graze\" but just been for a lidal shop not one naughty thing in there, Not even wine ! as it seems now i cant drink anymore it gives me a bad stomach ( great !) My trolley was all nice healthy fruit and veg brown bread etc, but having said that I was always healthy before and I still got bloody cancer, you cant win.!  I supose now its all about trying to maintain a weight and eat even more healthier. Some say not to take Tamoxifen on an empty stomach, I did find at night it was giving me terrible nightmares.",

      "Content": "Hi London lass, hope you are feeling a bit better today and had some sleep. Me ? no sleep the sweating is becoming unbarable at night. Im stripping off in hot shops whilst doing christmas shopping.  I am perimemo anyway but it was never anything like this last year. Dunno about you but I really dont like taking pills, Headache ones yea hang overs ( whats that ? I cant even drink anymore without feeling totally shit next day after only 3 glasses of wine ! not fair i miss my wine !) I am due to go see the oncon Monday, then Thur Acupuncture the only problem is I do not drive so it means hospital transport to the hosp for Aqu which mite only be 30 mins then another hour or more back home. I just dont have time ! I feel everyone who knows close friends and family think its all over, I dont feel at this moment in time its ever going to be over. The thought of living with 10 years of this drug feeling hot and sweaty all the time is quite frankly depressing. LIke everyone says why have they not developed anything to help deal with this side effect ? I did buy a lady magnet, got it on now. Dont really like wearing knickers to bed thou ! might try some tape at night- never been a knicker wearer to bed feels odd ! More clothing to make me hot as far as im concerned. Tried sleeping naked one night horrible. Need my little silky nightie, which of course has to be changed every night alongside with my bedding now every week !  I keep getting memories pop up on facebook... out with the girls, family meals, silly selfies and I look at me and think god I was so happy then I had no idea what was going on in my body. I spoke to the breast care nurse yday because im worried about these 2 lumps they found on a requested scan before i had RT unknown to me! I would not of known had i not got my docs notes as I FULLY INTEND ON SUING MY DOCTORS for misdiagnosis of 2 years !  I am adamant if they had sent me for a mammogram earlier it would of been a suspicious lump not turn to cancer lumpectomy and RT and drugs 10 years. If i had not gone back over and over and finaly when it changed shape back again I do not think i might of even been alive next year. Mine was Invasive. no noded involved but By christmas might of been a different story, Reading back over my hosp notes and Gps its so fucking obvious ! lady suspects a breast lump, lady has left breast rib pain, its all over my notes from 2014! lady worried as aunt had breast cancer ! omg HELLO !!! why was they not listening for the signs. I kept putting my faith in them and taking more and more tablets,  more blood test bloody asthma my ass !  I went Christmas shopping yesterday with mum, It fees strange not like before. I still think im going to die.! I keep thinking well this will  be my last Christmas then. And then i think about my house I love so much been here 20 years+ and someone else living here ! and digging up my garden where my beloved dog and  cats are burried. I keep having these black thoughts mostly about not ever having a man in my life ever again. (  I was married 18 years) . My house is not very clean or tidy anymore. I just cant be bothered. I did wall paper a feature wall thou 2 weeks ago. Is it me or does house work just not seem to matter anymore ? I look at the carpet up the stairs and think i shud hoover.... oh well cant be bothered. ! i do find the house work hard now and IF I HAD THE MONEY  i would pay a cleaner ! Mine is a 3/4 bed semi but an older house so lots of big rooms, it just feels too much especially having a dog with muddy feet and hairs its a total battle. I think back to when i was married, we used to blitz the house in the morning and take the kids out in the afternoon for a treat and it would stay like that all weekend. Now i can rarly get ontop of it. Does not help im selling loads and loads of clothes on e bay to try to make more money as pretty skint atm not working much well not at all. Self employed and working tax dont need to know about me being ill as i will not get any benefits! so im keeping stum ! my bank account rarely goes above 250 £300 these days, I cant ever see me now working my butt off for a high paid job. Everything has changed forever. How do we learn to accept this ? Suzie xxx ( sorry feeling down, no sleep again and no weekend plans again! and ex expecting  ME  to have kids all weekend so he can f^^^ off with his gf to a works party, its like my life does not matter to him anymore hes just out there enjoying his with someone new and expects me to slot in as baby sitter when its not my weekend for kids as he knows i have no social life with a bf!) ",

Im going to try with my lady magnet for a bit and acupuncture and see how that goes first. The sleep is a big thing for me.

      "Content": "HI Sacha, Im a year out from diagnosis and treatment. I had Invasive lobular cancer ER positive. My dx score ( the american test that sees if you would benefit from having chemo or not was low so no chemo) I had a lumpectomy ( big cut in underside of boob ) and had a cut to take out 3 nodes which was clear thankfully. I had the lumpectomy which I wont lie was painful but at least i still have my boob, I did get a v nasty infection after which made it drag on. I had 15 sessions of Radio therapy. Boring ! emotional, scary and very tiring at the end it was having a fatigue I've never known. I had been told that lobular cancer mostly effects older ladies yet i was 45 when I got it. I am not HER positive. There is a risk I read with Lobular that it can be hard to detect and sometimes appear in the other breast. At the moment I am cancer free having just had the first year mammo. But I will never let my guard down and will be checking myself very closely for the rest of my life. After the RT finished I went onto Tamoxifen for 10 years, took a while to get used to it and it bought on the early Menopause and i tried not to go on any more medication but in the end the hot flushes and sweats got so bad it was unbarable and now I take an antidepressiant called Venaflaxine which helps with the sweats but also helps with keeping you even and calmer as its a long emotional road ahead. Please try to build a repour with your breast care nurse as im sure you will be faced with lots of questions and you just need a friendly voice at the end of the fone sometimes to put your mind at rest. Every one is great on this site to help you with any questions and queries and worries you have  as we are either where you are now or been there and know how it feels. Hope this answers some of your worries Take care Suzie xx ",

      "Content": "HI Ruthie. My DX score was 12 and they decided I would not benefit chemo. I did however have 15 sessions of RT which im still worried about even thou its over. especially as 2 close members of my family have had heart attacks and had gone throu RT and sadly one died... ( she was in her 50s) Its a huge discussion to make and if i was put back in that position again I am really not sure I could do it. For me the loosing hair, eyelashes and eyebrows thing was just a sickening thought and make me more upset than the actual cancer ! which sounds real vain but I Just couldn't face it. Thank god I did not have to make that decision.... I struggle with the thought of recurrence its been only 5 weeks since my RT ended. so still very raw for me. I had a 40mm lobular cancer grade 2 no nodes involved margains clear. But i did sneek a look at my GPs screen and im pretty sure I read a risk of recurrence in 10 years time ( which seems to me when the drugs run out) When i questioned them about this they said i mistoke what i saw, untill they print off that letter then I will not belive them. I know it sounds all conspiracy type thing but I do feel they only tell us what we need to know. Such as RT the oncon never told me That my heart and lungs would be exposed to radiation. then when i did ask during it they said its only clipped. Im like CLIPPED I have perfect heart and lungs and you are poisoning it with radiation. Personally for me I would not want chemo. If that ment a shorter life then so be it. I know if if comes back I have already decided in my mind I would not put my body though that. Ladies that have hats off ! but for me no. I struggle with the thought of popping a drug for the next 10 years as it is..... Suzie.",

      "Content": "I know this is prob normal if you can call any of this horrible cancer year normal. But its been 7/8 weeks now since RT over I had a lumpectomy a few months before that, and well after the surgery yes it bloody hurt and I GOT AN INFECTION which set me back but once the wound and infection healed it was like recovering from any Op i supose/assume. Then came the RT. shooting pains, the rad burns which eventually subsided but now pretty much every day its hurting. Its not a pain I could describe its just there all the time. also ribs ache but then they did before the diagnosis and only stopped hurting with antidepressants which i stopped taking. I am concerned about the hard lump under the scar area too- how long is this supose to be like t his ?? i keep massaging it in the shower and after with creams. I am fortunate and give thanks to God that because it was a lumpectomy 6 months on now its starting to fill back out with collegen ( even thou it not completely level with the good one but i can live with that!)  I have an apt to see oncon in 2 weeks- im just fed up of it aching,. im sure the RT has done this as like I said after the surgery healed it almost felt as if I  had nothing done ( except visually and mentally of course) I can't lie on my side well either side anymore and cwch up in bed, have to sleep on my back. I also have to sit up very slowly its like it needs time to settle its a very odd feeling. Stages of waking now are ( oh no hang on I dont actually sleep anymore so im already awake) rephrase,,, stages of getting  OUT OF BED... think about it.... slid up the bed very slowly, sit up for 10 mins wondering how i got throu another sweating night and how im going to get thro the day,, leg swing over the edge of the bed another few mins to scan the room for slippers then and only then can I get up... usually loose balance and fall into the wall or trip over the sodding FAN ! THATS TAKEN PERMANENT RESIDENCE NEXT TO MY BED NOW.!! Any advice on the \" Norm \" for breast pain and lumpectomy scare mental issues and worries would be appreciated. Thanks Suzie. Much admiration to all ladies going thou/ newly diagnosed and living with breast cancer. Never thought it would be me posting on one of these forums.....",

Its horrible taking something that makes you feel so shit but your too scared now not to take it. Just had another shit nite not sleeping. I fall asleep ok as knackered ( ive been taking my sons melatonin tabs too her gets off the internet, you cant buy them here but i think they are on prescription so i might look into this, they do seem to help at bit, obv if im sleeping I do not notice how hot im getting but it must get to a point im so hot I wake up) What the heck is a menopause magnet ? I hear alot about bone mets, is this another word for its spread? does that then make it a stage 4 ? I have been worried about Rib pain from day one and still got it now which they will prob put down to the RT but i had it before, and its on the side of the B/C. I have had a bone scan so they said its ok, but i also read bone scans can sometimes miss it. No you have  not said too much. knowledge is power.!! I am one of these people I NEED TO KNOW.  I been suffering with black thoughts latly thou.... Being single 8 years since marriage ended and no male action for 5 of that 8 since b/c and all these side effects mostly the night sweats and hot day flushes I feel its a big stigma against dating. I had a date 2 weeks ago and as he had cancer too which was a shock announcement I decided to confess my year of hell and he pretty much lost interest ! I thought he would of understood more than your regular guy. I really thought we got on well. I feel damaged goods- as they years have gone on ive been a huge joke to most of my friends on the boyfriend front and i have built up a I DONT GIVE A SHIT ATTITUDE about men but obviously I do really and all the jokes have really started to hit home. Its got to the point i can't stand hearing my friends talk about their sex lives with their b.fs cos Ive wanted a new guy in my life for so long. Now, it feels like the goal post have been pushed further away cos as we know men are very sex orientated and for me now I don't feel that part of my life will ever come back. Im only 45- it feels so unfair to have had barly no loving for 8 years but now i feel like the door slammed shut in my face cos no man will want me cos of the side effects and the thought why get involved with her she will die soon..... sounds bleak but thats how i feel....",

Im not working atm as I am self employed so im pretty much just trying to keep ontop of the washing cleaning cooking etc, walking the dog and feeding my kids ( single mum now). I feel so uncomfortable I can't imagain working for someone now! I still get very tired its like a little job then a sit down. Im not sleeping either, the hot flushes are waking me up- bloated stomach seems to had subsided now thankgod ! I take peppermint oil caspsuals. What other issues are you facing, please tell me as if its something that might be the norm and I don't know I am the kinda person who needs to know to prepare myself. I am worried about being on the Tamoxifen 10 YEARS ! Have they really got enough evidence that this will help women long term  and beyond im only 45 now so 55 when it ends. I just feel that I will stop taking it and it will pop back up somewhere else from taking the tamoxifen so long... I can't help think of the drug as the enemy rather than the saviour... I am going to counselling, I have found this whole thing hard to deal with from start to end mostly because I have no support of a partner I think. My family and some friends seem to think im  over it move on kinda thing. They cant be more wrong..... SUzie ",
