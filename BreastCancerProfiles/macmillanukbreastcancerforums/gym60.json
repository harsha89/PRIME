      "Content": "Hi Kate,  Just realised that in my current emotional state that tho our treatment is almost the same mine was last year and not 2013........apologies for my confused, emotional state :/. Re tamoxifen, After about 6 weeks on it I was started a light bleed which was every day, after investigations the results all came back normal I came off the Tamoxifen so it was decided it was the culprit.  I did experience hot flushes and still do on Zoladex but only at night.  I might give the sage t tablets a try :).  Think the low mood is all part and parcel sadly. It is a tough road and not over when it's over.  Best wishes to you as well and take care, there is always someone on here to listen when it all gets too much. Love Karen x",

      "Content": "Hi Your experience and its timing almost mirrors mine.  I'm the exact same place, I was on tamoxifen but it caused problems so I'm now on zoladex. I feel the same if it's any help, too exhausted to resume normal life despite trying.  I walk a lot as well but after miss my gym classes which I'm too exhausted to go to.   I don't know if it's 'normal' to feel this way either  and not much help but you are not alone. Love Karen",

      "Content": "I'm glad someone has asked the question, I'm 54 and am 6 months post treatment surgery, chemo, radiotherapy and am currently on zoladex.  My sex drive has got up and gone since being on zoladex, feel exhausted all the time, sleep badly and worry all the time about my son (also has cancer) the rest of my family and wonder what happened to the woman I used to be. I met my partner 6 months before I was diagnosed and he has stuck with me through my treatment, I was very fit, had a high sex drive and a young outlook on life.  I feel bad not wanting sex and always being tired.......not what he signed up to when we met I'm sure. I'm not sure what the answer is but wanted you to know you are not on your own in this situation.  Lovely people on here giving good advice.  Best wishes to you all and Yvonne 17 hope things improve very soon xx",

      "Content": "Three weeks ago I found a lump, Iv been to the hospital, mammogram, ultrasound they have taken a biopsy from the lump and lymph glands.  They have already told me that it is cancer so Im waiting to find out what stage and the treatment that I will have to have.  Im really frightened and it has been such a shock, I dont smoke or drink, Im very fit and eat a healthy diet and until I found the lump had no obvious symptoms. (I am already on here in the carers group).  What makes it worse is my son was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma this time last year and has had a year of treatment.  All so much to deal with.  I wont get my results until after Christmas.  Any words of advice or help in any way would be a comfort.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Firstly don't be hard on yourself, you have been through such a lot, no one knows what it's like unless they experience it. You have done incredibly well to work at all!! Your should get sick pay from your employer while you are recovering. The whole thing is exhausting! My employer has paid me sick pay during treatment. Rads are no where near as bad as chemo ( not for me anyway) but it does make you feel tired. The emotional fall out from all of the treatment is huge and doesn't go away overnight. The help provided by Macmillan is fantastic and they can give you good pracital advice and emotional support when you think there isn't anyone. Take good care and know you are not alone. Xxxx",
