    "Content": "Hi all, Not used this site before but just wanted to say hello as today is one of those days when I find myself feeling a bit lost. One minute absolutely fine - next minute a snivelling mess! I was diagnosed with stage 2 IDC on 17.12.15 and am having a mastectomy this coming week. I'm 46 yrs old and although I somehow 'knew', it still came as a shock and still not got my head around it all yet. If anyone else, and I am sure there are many that understand this, then any support would be of amazing value. Thank you C.",
