      "Content": "I called Eurotunnel today but they would not quote due to me having possible ongoing treatment. Said to ring back when my treatment was finished. Really??  I asked what would happen if I fancied a holiday during my treatment. That question really threw them but I'm sure on this forum most people would see the benefit of a wee holiday. Anyway, I got cover through 'Good to Go' insurance £160 for 2 weeks cover for me and my husband perhaps I could have got cheaper but I was just glad to speak to a company that didn't slam the door when you say you're waiting for biopsy results I must say again that insurance companies who offer insurance but minus cancer cover are giving bad advise in my opinion. To the company that told me today that no insurance company would cover me as they all follow the same guidelines...YOU WERE WRONG!",
