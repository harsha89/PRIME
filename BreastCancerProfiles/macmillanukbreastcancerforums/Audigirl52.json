      "Content": "Hi Denise, I agree with the others, yesterday when I heard about the new royal baby I felt so happy with everything, then I saw the news about Rio Ferdinand's poor wife and I just cried - 34! and so quick, how can that be, I can relate to her poor children, my mum died when I was 9 of BC, so when I read about ladies who don't make it , it knocks me back so much.  I also think that every ache and pain is something major, I wish I could stop this, but I suppose it is normal now to think like  this. june 11th is not so far away, but so many ladies have pains and problems with these treatments, hopefully your oncologist will put your mind at rest. take care and enjoy the bank holiday weekend .

Good luck and merry christmas Janet xx",

Hope this helps you decide, I would say that you dont get a choice which group you are put in, it is random which put me off from the start! Love janet ",

I had a lumpectomy and radio therapy.  My oncologist said that so many tumours are picked up on this screening, so they are caught early enough, I am grateful every day for that mammogram saving my life.  Herceptin i think is a hormone drug, I take tamoxifen, it depends on your tumour , if its positive or negative, or estrogen receptive as to which drug you take. Good luck with your operation,  you will get a lot of support on this site - just don't google anything! Take care Janet x",
