      "Content": "Sadly Mistymoley I have asked for help so many times and nothing ever changes. it seems if i burst into tears, i get mopped up and then life goes on as before, they just dont hear. My husband lost his job as a manager about two years ago so he is now on half the wage he was on plus i can hardly do any hours now so we are really strapped for cash and wondering if holidays will be a thing of the past now, so getting help in the home is not an option. xx",

      "Content": "Hi, i just had to write and hope someone understands. I had grade IV invasive breast cancer in 2007 for which i had 6 months of FEC chemo,  then a mastectomy in 2008 and Tamoxifen until November 2010 when i had a recurrence and they switched my treatment to Zoladex which i have every 12 weeks. I am now still on this and my shins and hips are so so painful (and i have a very high pain thresh hold as i once worked as a  full time gardener with a fractured elbow for two months, before i thought it smarted a bit still and should get it checked!!!)  My shins throb so painfully even when im sitting down and when i get up in the morning i can barely stand weight on my feet.  I hate to moan but the exhaustion is unbelievable too and i only work about 15hours a week now but noone notices how flipping tired i am. My husband comes home from work and if i say im tired he says hes exhausted......the kids come home from school and college and say how tired they are and they all sit down.  I'm trying to keep the housework done, decorating done, garden done and noone seems to want to help with any of it. why dont they see im near to cracking up? zoladex has completely zonked my lobido too so i don't even get a hug or kiss now, it's like i'm not interesting any more. I don't want to complain too much to my consultant as i know the zoladex is working, well hopefully the joint pain doesn't signify anything sinister. Sorry to moan, but noone here is listening  ",

      "Content": "Thanks Dorothee, you are so right i am definitely at that breaking point. I go walking with a friend but take pain killers to do this but i love the outdoors so it is the best therapy. However its not with my husband and he doesn't seem to have a zest for anything in life. He says take it easy then does nothing to help so i get fed up with the mess and do it all myself still. Its so infuriating. Kids are 18 and 15 and do nothing either but i think thats just teens. I told my son (18) the other day that the drug was buying me time and not a cure but its made no difference, im here for convenience to them!! My chemo also damaged my heart so am on two heart pills which cause confusion and sometimes i need to be told stuff again and again and this irritates the kids so we fall out which i find most upsetting. I can sometimes look at something simple like car tax and just feel panic and think I dont know how to deal with it, something so simple seems ridiculous eh?! I was well supported through my illness but its like now im up and about again all is ok, why dont they realise how broken we end up inside? I'm starting to hate the person that comes home at the end of the day groaning about how tired he is......it shouldn't be that way. good on you cycling 5miles!!!!!! i might get to the end of the road!!!!   Thank you so much for listening xx",

Dorothee.....& Poolm4n how do you talk to someone who simply doesnt want to talk ? any chats we have had ends up wifh zero   change or with him grumpy .  i need to have someome with us i think so he may at least take notice.   Misty moley.......ive applied!!!!! very scary but having spoken to yoj guys i am beginning to realise that if i sit on the sofa between 9-5 im not being lazy. i seem to have an inability to rest and do really feel guilty if i even sit with a cuppa when he is at work.!   my big problem is how to tackle him. you are right about them thinking all ok as ive always been strong even when i want to drop on the spot. ive got work now and know it will tire me but my daughter wants to go out Later and i know i will make her grumpy if we dont go somewhere........vicious circle eh?! xxx",
