      "Content": "hi Karan, well done! I don't know if you can offer me any advice? I'm the same age as you and I've just been diagnosed and am also waiting a right mastectomy and sentinel lode biopsy in about 10 days. The thing is I just cannot decide about reconstruction or not. We don't know yet about radiotherapy (probable) or chemo (unlikely but not ruled out), and I honestly can't make my mind up. I'm a very active person, I run, (I ran my first ever half marathon recently, whilst black and blue from the biopsy and waiting the results!)  I garden, I do pilates and ballroom dancing. Obviously I'm very scared and the main thing is getting well, but besides that all I want to do is get back to being active as soon as possible, but I also am scared about how I will react to the mastectomy. I'm lucky to have a very supportive husband who will support whichever decision I make. The reconstruction options all look terrifying and other than straight forward implants, would impact other areas of my body which at the moment are still fit and healthy!  Please feel free not to answer this, but I wanted to ask, do you use a prosthesis in your swimming costume, or do you go without? Any advice gratefully received. thanks x ",
