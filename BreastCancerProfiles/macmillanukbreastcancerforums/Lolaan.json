    "Content": "I was on Letrozole for a year. My only problem  with it was a bad rash, tried to see whether by changing brand it would improve. Eventually was prescribed Femara, the original. Not long after starting Femara, I started having bad joints pain, it was bearable so I did stuck with it for a while, then decided to stop Femara  and take Teva, had a box left of it, to see if my pains would subside. I still carried on having joint pains, so concluded it was coming from Letrozole, but yesterday, I woke up with the worst back pain I ever have experienced, I could not stand up or walk for long, once I had found a position I had to stay there, moving from there was so painful. I've even experienced some spasm in my back, which I presumed was muscle spasms. It was lucky that it was saturday, because I could have never been able to go to work in the state I was. I have applied some warm compress on my back (didn't know if I had to use warm or cold compress), and started looking for some back pain exercises on the internet, but though I am a bit better, bending over is still very painful and today those exercises were rather short. Has anyone experienced anything like that on Letrozole, and does anyone have any remedies to get rid of that back pain. I certainly don't want to stop working or lose my job because of it.  ",
