    "Content": "Hi Anne I have just finished 6 FEC treatments. It's better to be driven as it can make you a bit foggy. I found that I didnt drive for about a week after each dose and then cautiously a short drive the first time. Not everyone is sick, and usually kicks in after several hours, if indeed you are sick at all. The medication is very good. There was always plenty of food around on the chemo unit. Luncheon bags. Also lots of drinks available. I always had brekfast, and a light lunch. I have a wheelchair user husband but no children, so no great demands at home. It really wasnt nearly as bad as I had  thought.The message I had from someone who had treatment 5 plus years before,was 'It's not as bad as some folk make out, and the worst part for me was losing my hair'. True!  That isn't so bad once you have got your 'head' round it.. Also I went out for evening walks, and day walks, but mostly stayed at home with lots of phone calls, cheery chums and emails, visits to my Dad, lots of books, and TV on hard disc.I did eat out side in 'safe eating venues'. I am looking forward to a celebration meal out Monday and looking round the shops. It wasn't so bad. All the Best Maria    ",
