I did wonder, however, how often mistakes could be made on letters or reports due a typing error, bearing in mind, in your case, the - & + keys are next to each other on the keyboard. I thought if sometimes people like yourself may have extra worry about treatments and diagnosis from what may be a simple mistake, but in the medical order of things the implications could be huge and make a big difference to a person's treatment and wellbeing. Hope you get it sorted out soon  Best wishes.",

I was also given lidocaine lollipops, to keep in the fridge, for use through the day which were very soothing although wouldn't help much with taste problems as they taste quite odd. I hope you both get it sorted out soon as it is very difficult when you can't eat comfortably on top of everything else. Kind regards and Hugs.",

They were the  very large sized cod liver oil capsules, probably the one a day version, by the look of them.  Maybe I should have swallowed them when I got home, they might've helped oil my joints. Even worse, I forgot to remove them straight away and didn't realize until a couple of hours after I got home.  We'd already stopped at a shop on the way home and had visitors when I got back. Nevermind.  At least I will know if I ever need to have one again and, also, so will any other ladies who are due to go for a scan, after reading this. Best Wishes",

While I was waiting in the cubicle in my little hospital gown the lovely Radiographer came in with a bottle of capsules, to see if I was ready.  She said, holding one of them in her hand, \"we need to to put one of these on your nipples\"  \"Really\", said I, whilst trying to imagine how they would fit and what would happen to the oil, \"so do I just snap them in half and use one on each side\" \"Nooo\" she smiled, \"You get two, one for each side\".  She then produced a roll of tape and handed me two pieces and said \"Just tape one over each nipple, we use them as a guideline to line you up in the machine and so we know where we are when the dye goes in\" I felt so stupid but this lovely lady did not split her sides or fall about laughing, though she could quite easily have done and I wouldn'tve blamed her. Anyway, all of the staff were brilliant with me and so helpful, especially when it came to getting me on the board and into the machine.  I'm still sore around the ribs and my arms aren't moving so well but I'm so pleased that it's done.  Now I can just hope that the result is of the better kind as my type of surgery is dependant upon this.

      "Content": "Hi everyone.  Having just been diagnosed a week ago, please forgive me not knowing the correct procedures here as I am new to it and not a natural posting messages sort of person.  When my consultant told me the news last week he gave me some guidelines on what my treatment will be, indicating that I will need WLE surgery (hopefully) followed by radiotherapy and then five years of Tamoxifen.  My concern is that I have suffered from severe chronic FM Syndrome for many years and also, following a fall last year, was diagnosed with Osteoporosis so I also have treatments for my bones. I am very worried about how I will be affected by the side effects of Tamoxifen as the list mimics most of the problems I have already experienced with the fibromyalgia and I don't know if I could tolerate doubled up pain etc.  I also read a couple of brief articles that suggest I may not be able to take my regular medicines while using Tamoxifen. Obviously, I will follow the doctor's treatment plan as getting rid of the cancer is now priority and I will cope the best way I can but I haven't been able to find out much about managing this type of treatment combined with regular meds for other illnesses. Does anyone have these conditions or anything similar who can give me some advice regarding my next steps forward?",

I hope I didn't come across as some sort of wimp when I posted my question.  I'm actually a very practical person and one of life's natural fighters but like all of you ladies I'm suddenly  finding myself in uncertain times. I agree some of the websites can throw out some scary, and occasionally downright weird stuff but you have no need to worry on that score.  I avoid most of it.  I stick to a  couple of trusted UK sites for any info I need and this has worked well for me over the past couple of years.  The stuff I read about Tamoxifen I found from the drug company website. Interestingly enough this is the site where I have obtained all of my recent information over the past few weeks.  Any stuff I have googled always brings up this one at the top of the page, thankfully. My next challenge is a purely practical one - How to fit me into the MRI machine next week. Thank you for your help.  Hugs to you tooxx",

I just wanted to share my very good news.  My surgeon was very pleased with the results.  The cancer was very small and it has all been removed. He also said that he had removed 7 lymph nodes and they were all clear.   As you will all understand I am feeling a lot more relieved and happy tonight than I did this time last night.  Even though I have had a very good team and they were all brilliant and even though the Consultant had told me that they were quite confident of a good result, until the actual lab results are through and they tell you officially, there is still that niggly feeling of doubt. I'm now full of optimism and ready for the next stage of battle, keeping things this way.  I shall plod along until I get my oncology appointment then be ready for the radiotherapy. Sorry if I'm waffling on again but I'm so pleased to be rid of the little parasite and I don't want any of it's little friends choosing to lodge with me again.

As for exhaustion and insomnia I think all of us on here will be suffering from those so you seem quite normal in that respect.  I've been trying out Mindfulness after I read a magazine article about it and I've found it very helpful just focussing on one thing and forgetting everything else. I've also been doing a lot of deep breathing about every hour, which I've found to be of huge benefit.  It's good just closing your eyes and thinking of nothing for a minute or two. Maybe some of the other ladies can give you more info about the appointments than I can which will help you nearer the time. Hope your mood lifts a little soon.  Sending you good vibes and Big Hugs xx",

The other main side effect is the hair loss but this is also a side effect of Tamoxifen as well. Hope this helps. Kind regards",
