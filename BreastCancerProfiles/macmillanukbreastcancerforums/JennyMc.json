Was just wondering if this type of pain/stiffness was normal after node removal?  It's not enough to take painkillers but is worse in the eve? Jen ",

I remember the same pain immediately after the op and am definitely getting more feeling back everywhere which includes lots of different aches and  pains - I should be grateful for the feeling back but can't help fear the worst! I've a check next week before my chemo starts so will mention it then too Jen xxx",

We got some pink wigs for her and I told her that the medicine made it fall it but will grow back and she hasn't batted an eyelid, in fact she keeps outing me and demanding I show everyone my baldy head!!!  I think the actual fact of having a 1 and 3 yr old means we are in a good position to cope with the fatigue!  I got both vaccinated for chicken pox which you are entitled to in the NHS too Jen xxxx",

I had drains for 2 weeks - I think my surgeon doesn't like to rush them... but I got little bags to carry them in and told my daughter they were full of calpol!  My 9 month old decided to crawl for the first time the day I came home just to really put me through my paces!  It was honestly all manageable as is the chemo, I've a great support system thankfully but I've kept all our little gangs routines and play dates.  Now I have a comparison I honestly think chemo is easier than a tired teething toddler any day xxx ",

Just wanted to say that I was diagnosed when my little boy was 8 months old (have a 3 yr old also). I'm coming out the other side now and have just started radiotherapy after a double MX and 6 cycles of chemo and if I can offer any assurance or answer any questions please don't hesitate to ask. In all honesty everything was doable and I have not once wished this time away- we've have a fab summer so far without this pesky cancer stopping us and so can you, you can and will do this xxxxx",

      "Content": "Oh ladies! It's just so horrible for you both. Waiting in limbo waiting for your results is rubbish,  but I honestly felt so much better when we got the plan of action in place and the ball rolling- I think it gives you some control back? i had an enlarged lymph node too that they biopsied but came back clear. I had no symptoms- I'm 37 also and had yearly MRI due to family genetics and history so I feel incredibly lucky. Mine was grade 3 multifocal- 9mm, 3mm and 5mm but they treated as a 5cm area of \"at risk of cancer\" so with that and my age etc I got the full works! I was worried about the aggressiveness etc due to our age but as my lovely Mac nurse says- while it goes against us a little , it also goes for us in the sense that we get all treatments available.   The hair thing.... actually the most liberating bit! Mine fell out first cycle so myself and stroppy 3 yr old played hairdressers and shaved it! I've more compliments bald than with hair!!! But you also have options such as the cold cap with I'm sure some ladies on here will tell you about. i had my eyebrows tattooed before chemo- best thing I did and I can get ready in seconds- handy with feral 1 yr old...  Of course I've  had some down days but I've also had some brilliant ones- the treatments are doable- there is a wide range of things to help side effects and some gorgeous complimentary treatments you can have to feel a bit pampered at some Macmillan centres.  I'm not exactly fighting fit- more slummymummy than yummy and I'm managing (with help and love) ok?  In regards to the size of your lump- you've just made a gorgeous human so there will be a number of explanations as to the size that may not be related? I had some cysts and blocked ducts going on too when I was diagnosed. i started to take a pen and pad to appointments- mum brain and chemo brain is hysterical so write it down and any questions you want to ask- I was forever bursting back in having forgotten to ask stuff! ",

It's on their website- I got my 1 and 3 yr old vaccinated last month. The receptionist denied all knowledge a first however I asked for a Doctor to call me and they confirmed and ordered the vaccines for me. It's a live vaccine so best to triple check with your doctor. My two were fine- no side effect and now we don't have to worry at nursery as there are lots of cases.  I got all the info on the NHS chicken pox website. Good luck with chemo- I'm halfway through- it's all very doable and Goes surprisingly quick!!! Jen xxxx",
