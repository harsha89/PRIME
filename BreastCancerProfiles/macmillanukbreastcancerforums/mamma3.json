      "Content": "Totally understand Aimee. Triple negative tend to have less nodes affected then again, it\u2019s more likely than yours to come back. Good n bad to all of them. Whatever it is - it\u2019s getting dealt with. That\u2019s the main priority. I\u2019ve just had a full Sunday roast and now begging out.

I went to hospital in my furry boots, big coat and a scarf (not a woolly one) just in case I got cold. I didn\u2019t need them to be fair but I did sip on a cuppa. All I would say is make sure they wet your hair through, lather your hair with conditioner and if it doesn\u2019t feel tight, tell them.  It didn\u2019t bother me at all but I\u2019ve a pretty high pain threshold. I think if you\u2019re determined enough, you can put up with anything. I\u2019m doing it to minimise any disruption for the ankle biters so I\u2019ll do what it takes. Just get through the first ten minutes and you\u2019ll be fine. If it works fine if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ve already ordered a wig, got eyebrow stamps and eyelashes. Lol x",

They were very thorough with the cap, I\u2019m a total needlephobe and was dreading the canulla more than anything. It was doable. It isn\u2019t as bad as you think - I guarantee it. The cold cap is fine. It is a bit uncomfortable but it\u2019s ten minutes to get through. It\u2019s worth it to me to try and keep some hair. I\u2019ve been fine so far since. But of a sore throat, bit of tummy ache, didn\u2019t have a fantastic sleep and ate everything in the house on the first night.  But I\u2019ve been known to do that pre chemo so?! Full kip last night. It\u2019s doable.    You can and will do it x",

I know some people have s couple of paracetamols before they go but I didn\u2019t bother. Get a cuppa so you can sip on it but honestly, I\u2019ve had worse hangovers! And for longer - lol.  Just think that\u2019s it\u2019s not permanent and it\u2019s just ten minutes of discomfort and the rest is totally bearable. I didn\u2019t go to bed until about 12.30/1 and literally ate my way through the house! Total scavenger. I woke up about 5/6 but just had a couple of hours later on in th me day. I slept fine Saturday night and have done since. Constantly hungry tho but I\u2019ve eaten well. Take some water/dilute to bed with you. Hope this helps xx",

It should have been offered automatically but wasn\u2019t. You are much more likely to have the mutated BRCA or BRCA1 gene if you are triple negative hence the testing. Hope this helps  xx",

      "Content": "Morning Vicky I\u2019m triple negative and just started chemo after a lumpectomy to remove the lump. The FEC chemo treats triple negative (mine is just EC without the F but there are other hospitals that continue to use all three). I\u2019m having TAXOL after that (second treatment of chemo - again, this is used for triple negative and has good results). Then radiotherapy. Good for targeted treatment for triple negative although I\u2019m not sure if that is still offered after mastectomy. You\u2019d have to check. Triple negative just doesn\u2019t respond to hormonal treatment so chemo and rads are key.  Hope that helps in some way - there is a group for triple negative people and that might help too. Your FEC is already helping the TN so don\u2019t feel it\u2019s not getting any help! Keep feeling positive xx",

I had my lumpectomy and Sentinel node biopsy on the 23rd March and am all healed and was back at work this week. I went for my results last week and was over the moon that nodes were clear. I received a copy of the letter sent to my doctor this week and the diagnosis has now changed to invasive ductal carcinoma (medullary like). Whilst this is still rare (about 4-5%) it\u2019s not as rare as previous (<1%). I\u2019m off to see my oncologist on the 19th April. I just wondered how you were getting on xx",

      "Content": "Hi all Well I\u2019ve been to my oncologist appointment and have to say I was pretty disappointed. Just like you Me63, is come away from my initial meeting with my surgeon with a really detailed plan (pre-surgery). Even with a \u201cif this happens, the next stage is this\u201d \u201cbut if thus happens, the next stage will be this). However, I came away from my oncologist meeting without any detailed info other than the two different types of chemo I\u2019d be having (of which I can\u2019t remember the name EC?), that would be for 3-4 months (once every three weeks). I said from the beginning I would cold cap. However, she then said I\u2019d then undergo weekly chemo on another drug (cannot remember this one) and they don\u2019t offer the cold cap with that so would be pointless trying the cold cap on the initial chemo. As I wasn\u2019t expecting this, I didn\u2019t really question it. I\u2019m also anaemic so on iron tablets which is fine.  Feel a bit deflated now as I\u2019d got my head around the cold cap (no pun intended ), chemo every three weeks etc etc and knowing what\u2019s what.  So - bit knacked off today Emma x",
