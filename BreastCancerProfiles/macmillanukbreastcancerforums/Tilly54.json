      "Content": "Hi all, I finished chemo in October and had a lumpectomy on 1st December. I was told a week before Christmas that the lumpectomy hadn't worked so now face having a mastectomy - I'm not worried about this as it means there will be no worries regarding new lumps etc However, although my hair has started to grow I just don't look like 'me', I have also put on over a stone, I had a photo taken New Year's Eve but just look so hideous on it that there is no way I'm showing to anyone. I'm trying hard not to moan to my family and friends but they just don't know how it feels to lose your identity in such a horrific way - it's my birthday tomorrow and my mom asked what I wanted - I only want hair but especially a fringe , mom told me to be sensible but to be quite honest there isn't anything I want or need except my hair. I have been referred for counselling which starts this Friday but will it work? Sorry for moaning but there's only you lovely ladies on here who truly know how I feel.",

      "Content": " Hi, I've got stage 2 breast cancer which has not spread, is invasive but not aggressive.  I've had 3 sessions of docetaxol and due to have the first of 3 FEC sessions next week. I've been very very lucky and suffered hardly any side effects from chemo. I'm due to have surgery in December and radiotherapy in February when I can finally return to work (I work in a primary school so off due to all the germs) Tomorrow I have a mammogram booked and will see the breast surgeon too. I want to know is it worth asking my surgeon, as my tumour has shrunk greatly, can I have surgery now and forget the last three sessions of chemo? - to be honest I just want my life back Thanks xx  ",

I asked the breast surgeon for my life back today, he said there was no way they could speed it up but assured me that surgery would be done asap after chemo. my tumour has shrunk significantly and I had genetics result back today too - not brca! Thank god! Sorry for whinging but I really am fed up of all of this Tilly x",
