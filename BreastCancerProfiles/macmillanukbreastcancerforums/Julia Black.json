    "Content": "Hi All   I wonder if anyone can help me. I have a dear friend whose wife has Triple Negative Breast Cancer.  After initial diagnosis she underwent a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy.   However, a year and a half later and she has been told she has a tumour on the lung.   Can anybody advise if they have had experience of recurrence with triple negative and if so what treatment options were discussed.     The more informed before appt next week the better.   Many thanks to you all.",
