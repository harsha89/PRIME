    "Content": "Hi everybody. Had first day at work on tuesday after finished chemo and radio in march, absolutely shattered and think ive gone back too soon. Doctors wanted me to stay off another couple of months just to get myself pulled back together but work has been a pain, no phone calls or anything. Wondering whether i shud put another sicknote in and push for my ssp1 form, has any of you brave ladies been through anything similar? Allison x",
