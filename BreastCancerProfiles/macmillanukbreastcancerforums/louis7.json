Glowing in the dark would be the best perk eh?! x",

I get real achey joints and love deep, hot side of warm, Epsom salt baths but I start RT in a couple of weeks and fully expected to have to wait until it's all finished to have baths.  Any advise or thoughts welcome!",

      "Content": "Hi Kate! Nice that we are in sync (that sounds weird that anything much about all this could be nice - but you know what I mean )  Odd that you didn't get FISH results.  Neither do I get how you could be expected to pay for any treatment.  Has anyone else on the site heard this?  I don't mean to concern you, I'm as in the dark as you and it really seems that everyone has different treatment.  perhaps you can ask here or check on the Macmillan helpline, for peace of mind. I'm not surprised all this had you feel teary, it's enough to get your head around without these uncertainties.  I had a really low weekend last week and I think it's important to roll with it.  It's harder for you with a little one, I hope you find time to purely put yourself first.  I do know you are doing great, that you have endless support here and I hope this past weekend helped - we've had bright blue skies, freezing but lovely and sunny with it As for blue tatts - you had to be different eh?!    I don't know about you but I still have a blue, going green, nipple from my opp.  Hoping it will eventually return to 'normal'! Will be thinking of you this week, especially Thursday.  We got this X",
