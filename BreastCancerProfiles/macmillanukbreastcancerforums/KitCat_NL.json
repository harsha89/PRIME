    "Content": "Hi mam to 3 I am still waiting for the 2nd lot of tests for HER2 to come back... Apparently these need to be checked by 2 people and only one person has checked the result. In a way, a similar situation and incredibly frustrating as i am still not sure what my treatment will be (the first test came back as borderline HER2 positive) Wishing you strength and patience and enjoy being a mam to 3!
