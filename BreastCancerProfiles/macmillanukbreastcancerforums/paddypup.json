      "Content": "Hi  Sorry if these are silly questions, but I just keep mulling them over in my mind.  I tend to overthink and over analyse things which does not lend itself to a good nights sleep! Firstly, my daughter is currently going through neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and from what I have read on here, it seems common for a marker clip to be put into the tumour site so that its location can be clearly determined after the chemo has done its stuff.   What I am wondering is how can clear margins be checked post surgery if the chemo shrinks, or better still, totally demolishes the tumour(s), when no markers have been placed?   Secondly, as in my daughters case, there are multiple tumours, how can we be sure they are all of the same type when only the presenting tumour was tested under biopsy.  Is it safe to assume they are all going to be the same?  The multifocality was only discovered on the pre-chemo mri so came as a shock to us all.  Would it make any difference to her treatment if for example one was her2- and one her2+ and how would we even know? This was not something I had considered previously but have now read numerous posts from others who have indeed had different types of tumour within the same breast.   I do not want to give my daughter anything else to think/worry about (she is very young), as she has enough to contend with as it is so thought I would ask on this fountain of knowledge.  Hoping someone can quiet my overactive mind. Thank you",

      "Content": "Hi Kiwi06 I am so with you here.  My daughter was just 23 (now 24), and I have done nothing but ask why why why.  I don't suppose we will ever know but it does not stop the wanting to scream and shout at the world, and myself for failing to protect her from this, irrational as that may be.   Life can be so cruel and unfair.   It is a very heartbreaking and emotional time and the waiting for the plans to be put in place is the pitts.  My heart really goes out to you and wanted you to know you are not alone.   I will think of you and your daughter on the 2nd.  Big hugs pp",

      "Content": "Hi.  I cannot help with your hospital policy, but my daughter had a portacath fitted using mild sedation and local anaesthetic only.  The procedure itself was very quick.  The longest part was sitting around waiting for the sedation to wear off.  She was up and out within a couple of hours - straight to the nearest food outlet as she was starving!   No issues or lasting effects, other than some beautiful bruising - but this is to be expected.  She was initially told it would be done under a general anaesthetic by the  breast care team, but apparently it is now rarely done that way.  So if you are worried about having a general it might be worth having a chat with the team.  I also think different hospitals favour different placement of the port.  My daughters is sited just under her collar bone, but I have heard of others having them fitted into underside of the upper arm.  With your previous surgeries, this may also be something for you to consider.  As for being easier to cope with - we have nothing to compare it to but my daughter finds it so easy and is glad she has it.  It also means she can shower normally and not have to worry the same way you would with the other lines, ie. covers and taping the dangly bits down! .  I suppose everyone will have a different take on which is best, but certainly the port so far (it is early days), has earned its stripes.   Hope everything goes well for you. pp",
