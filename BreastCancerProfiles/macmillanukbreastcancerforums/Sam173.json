      "Content": "Hi FiveJays I found my self in your situation a few months back my wife was Diagnosed with Breast Cancer in April and had the Lumpectomy to remove the lump 4cm and a sentinal node biopsy these result was it had spread to five of the lymph nodes she the had all of them removed in a second operation. The surgery then the results will determine what treatment regime they will advise your finacee to take My wife also has Ulcerative colitis and I was concerned the treatments would effect this but we have been assured it does not other people have even said their symptoms eased during Chemo and we have three children as well  She did not have any scans or anything like that until after her surgery which I thought was strange as well and asked the relevant questions She is now having Chemo x 6 and then Rads x 6 My advise is to write down the questions you need to ask and make use of the diary type book they given to you as everything seems to be a  blur for the first four or five weeks We where open with our Kids they are 13 , 10 and 7 and explained everything to them. You have a long rooad adhead of you both and if I can help with advise then please respond I am usally on this site oonce a day as I find it helps me deal with what iis going on sam173  ",
