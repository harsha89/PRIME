      "Content": "Hi. I started on zoladex and letrazole three months ago. When my surgeon suggested hormone therapy he gave me leaflets for both drugs. I took them with me when I went to my GP for my first prescription.  The doctor arranged the DEXA scan, only after i asked and she read up on it, got the test weeks ago but no one interested in the results, not been received at GP and I was told to phone the hospital myself if I wanted them. I asked the nurse about my cholesterol as the leaflets said my treatment can cause high cholesterol.  The nurse asked where I got the leaflet as if I was being paranoid.   The leaflets on individual hormone therapies are available from breast cancer care and it might be useful to get the leaflet, see what you need checked and ask your GP. I was discharged from onc and told my GP will take care of my treatment now. But I really feel it's up to me to make sure everything is covered as the GP's are really not that interested. Take care Keeker",

You only have to declare it after you have been offered the position. Several job applications include a section on disability but my understanding is you don't have to complete this part until you have been offered the job, and only to be used by HR or occupational health assessment, however many large employers have positive discrimination so you get a guaranteed interview if you declare it.  However the reality is quite different. I was asked at interview what I had been doing for the last six months. How could I answer that without mentioning cancer? I was back out on the street within five mins. The legislation says if you have cancer, or have had cancer. So you are covered by the legislation whether you agree or not. No one will use the word cured. Even people who had cancer many many years ago are still covered by the legislation.   You are not classed as disabled for everything. You don't qualify for the free bus pass or blue badge for example.  It is so very confusing,  as I am single I can work 16 hours and get working tax credit to make up my income I think. I just think I will use the legislation where it helps me.  Take care Keekers",

I didn't need chemo but the one where the man falls after being told he has cancer was me on the 28th jan. The reality is we are alone going through treatment but the lucky ones like yourself have close support. I was recently asked \"would I like to help fight cancer\" by a  fundraiser.  My first thought was to say I am already fighting cancer thanks very much. My emotions are very raw and all these adverts are driving me crazy, some take me right back to the feelings I had months ago. I did bake for the macmillan coffee morning but refused to attend any coffee mornings as I won't be the token cancer patient.  I just hope these feelings will fade over time but it still surprises me every time I am forced back to those days, those feelings, that pain.  So much of the damage of breast cancer seems to be mental more than physical, Take care Keeker",

You don't say what you are seeing onc for, I got rads and at the first appointment they examined me to check I was healing ok, they discussed rads and mentioned my hormone therapy,  that was a lot for one appointment.   I had already decided not to take hormone therapy until after rads so I had a list of questions written out. Unfortunately I was so stressed I can't understand my own notes when I wrote down the replies. I also took the chance to get the oncologist to run all my figures through his computer to see my personal results, it helped making my decisions. I got the time scales I could expect to wait which was great. I hope your appointment goes well,  Take care Keeker",

I don't think the nurse can really make a diagnosis but she checked you out and it obviously wasn't whatever what she was checking for. It is very frustrating when you don't get a definite answer as to what has caused your symptoms and this fobbing us off with 'probablys' is often the best we can hope for.  If you are really  worried about this then I would speak to your BCN and possibly try and see your GP. You have had a big op and it can take ages to get over, both the physical operation and also the emotional stress. I hope you feel better soon.  Take care Keeker",

A round trip of 120 miles. When I had problems my BCN only worked 3 days a week and every problem was met with \"pop in and I'll take a look\" so I contacted my local hospital myself and asked to speak to the BCN there.i had loads of problems after surgery and she was always there even though technically I was not her patient. After rads I insisted all my care be transferred to local hospital and it was no problem. Maybe you could try that.

When I was getting my mammogram I asked the lady to show me what she was looking at. She showed me the calcification on my scan, this had never been mentioned,  I asked for a copy of my pathology report and got the BCC leaflet \"understanding your pathology report\". It turned out I had IDC, DCIS and malignant calcification. Only the IDC had been mentioned up to that point. It made no difference to my treatment but it has made a difference to my decision to take my hormone treatment. I did think I would refuse this treatment but after finding out there was three cancers in there I will carry on. There was limited time at appointments and they only mentioned the most important one. I would agree that the best thing is to write down any questions you have, your BCN can answer a lot and you do forget a lot during appointments and kick yourself on the way home that you forgot to ask things. If you want copies of reports and doctors letters just ask. I found mine very useful.  Take care Keeker",

Constant aches and pains, poking yourself to check but most of all hoping it's all a big mistake.    You can't really start fighting until you know what you are fighting against.

I was given the booklet \"understanding breast cancer\" by my nurse and found it useful in working out what questions I wanted answered. Keep a note pad close by. Write down questions you have. Your breast care nurse can answer a lot and write down answers, you forget a lot. You will be more focused once you know what you are dealing with and have your treatment plan. We are all different, our cancers are all different and so our treatments are different. Just now it's all about coming to terms with having cancer, and dealing with other people and that's not easy,  telling everyone you are fine when screaming inside.  Whatever you feel is normal, take your time and don't push yourself too much. You have had a hugh shock and it's ok to have the wobbles,   I hope you stick around and let us know if we can help. We've all been there.  Take care Keeker",

As you have had a mastectomy there's nothing left to zap,  I was not given a choice but when I checked with my oncologist he said the percentages were the same for both treatments. Your cancer was er+ so the tamoxifen is to stop another cancer forming,  it's a hard drug, some people really struggle with the side effects,  there is a leaflet on the breast cancer care website for tamoxifen take a look and write down what you need to know. I can't take it because of the risk of blood clots so I'm taking a different hormone therapy but I think they all thin your bones so I asked for a DEXA bone scan to check my bone density,  that way if I get another next year I can check if my bones have thinned, my treatment can also increase cholesterol so I got that checked as well, I feel we do have to check all this out for ourselves and make sure we know what could happen taking these drugs, no one in my medical team suggested any of these things and I really feel they should have. One lady I went for rads with already developed a blood clot and my friend who had cancer 9 years ago breaks a rib if someone gives her a hug,  which could have been prevented if someone had told her there was a high risk of osteoporosis and given her pills to prevent it.
