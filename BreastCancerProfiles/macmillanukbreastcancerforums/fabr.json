    "Content": "There's a wonderful video on YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuwJZZbP5ew - showing a young girl having her hair restored for her wedding, very emotional. I went to this place as well (Mark Glenn Hair Enhancement - www.markglenn.com) which is in Mayfair, London but I didn't have what the girl in the video had as they felt I had enough coverage to have normal extensions.  However, their extensions are not the usual human hair type, instead they are made from a synthetic fibre, so they're lighter on the head.  The other important thing for me (because I have a sensitive scalp) is that they don't use any glues or chemicals to attach the hair.  I'm due to go back next week to have them replaced but they've given me so much confidence (although at £450 I'm living on beans on toast to pay for them :-) but then it did take two people over 5 hours to put them in!).  The hair looks great and I've had no problems with the extensions apart from feeling a little sore for a day or two after they'd put them in.  Hope that's useful but above all, there are lots of options out there ladies, keep looking!",
