    "Content": "Hi, I'm Karen and know exactly how you feel it was the same for me. My husband didn't go with me to the hospital just said he had to go to work and when two weeks later after having part of my kidney removed and woke up at home feeling ill, I rang the hospital and they said I had to go back he just sat at the computer playing games and did not offer to go with me, later that night I ended up in intensive care and a few hours later lost the remainder of what was left of my kidney. Your not on your own there are many people in the same position as you unfortunately. I hope you are on the mend and do get the support you should have. Karen",
