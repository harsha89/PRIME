It's different here in Scotland we get a wig on prescription but when my journeys over if the wig is still ok I'll be donating it for somebody else to use. Somebody else on this forum recommended Anna Bandana for head wear so I've ordered a few things from there because its cheap.  Good luck to you too.",

      "Content": "Hey Lellyv, Unfortunately I have no advice to give you but am in a similar situation. I also live alone and have been diagnosed HER2 +. I was diagnosed on 28th Feb and like you have to get chemo first but because there is no availability of heart scans till the 9th of April - I probably  wont start treatment until the following week. I'm finding it all pretty surreal to be honest as I feel well and at present look well. What I've decided to do this week is clean my entire house, batch cook and freeze dinners in case I feel poorly and do a Tesco delivery shop of things I may need. Have you looked in the chemotherapy hints and tips section ( actually this might be on breast cancer org uk) - Im on both.  I'm also going to go and make an appt to look at wigs because I'm not going to try cold capping. Although I have read everybody responds to chemo completely differently so what I'm doing is really probably just keeping myself busy and distracting myself. Let me know how you get on. onwards and upwards on our journey. We can do this x ps There is lots of advice on this forum I have found it really helpful.",

It's just to see if there is anybody else on here with recommendations/ personal preferences for wig shops in Glasgow. Would like to get my wig before I lose my hair so that I can get used to it.",

I feel well, have a head of thick highlighted hair but know I need to get a wig now as in a few weeks I won't have hair. I'll try and get an appt with Parruche wigs then maybe and sandwich in between the lunch I have planned with friends - lunch at Atlantic brasserie before chemo takes over and I can't taste the same. Onwards and upwards - and again thanks for your reply",
