      "Content": "I started a similar thread back in August so hopefully what everyone told me on there was a help to you! I had my first chemo on Friday.  In the end for me (which may not be the same for everyone) the benefit of an extra 5 in 100 being here in the future was enough to get me to do it. My Gp said to me that in the end it's not about numbers as you don't know where in the 100 you are going to be...you could walk out the door and be fine, or you could benefit from chemo.  He said he'd hate for me to get a year down the line and wish that I had done more. And believe me...weeks ago I would have done anything not to have had chemo but now here I am doing it! It's a very personal choice and you have to weigh up your own situtation and come to terms with your situation and when you do you feel calmer, still very very scared, but calmer.   A friend of mine who is an oncologist said that if I was his sister he'd be f***in well insisting I have it! That was good enough for me!  Again, though I don't mean to sound pro-chemo because it is a personal choice and I know others have decided not to - but remember it is a choice, which is empowering. I hope things become clearer for you soon.  Loadsa love. xxx",

You're bound to feel stressed right now, it's natural.  Any news re your scan results? (Hope I've got the right Rebecca!)",

And each time it feels so much better afterwards.  Just an anecdote on men - my boyfriend often asks me why I am crying - I think they need to have a specific trigger, like an appointment or something, when often times it's just EVERYTHING! Glad you are feeling a bit better lovely. xxx",

      "Content": "I had my surgery last thurs (so 4 days ago) - lumpectomy and SNB.  I felt fine after surgery, home the same day and relatively 'normal' the next day.  But on Saturday and Sunday I was exhausted (which I expect is quite normal) but I have also been feeling really low emotionally.  I expected to feel relief and yet I just feel jolly sorry for myself, snappy and angry and very 'on edge'. Is this normal?  Have I been expecting too much of myself? I'm sleeping about 12 hours at night and napping again throughout the day.  I just wondered what experiences other people have had with similar operations. I felt that I would be happy that my C lump was out but I just feel a bit lost....while it was there I could feel it and feel that it was small and it didn't feel so scarey somehow, but now it's less tangible and I feel like the C is scarier as I don't know if it's anywhere else in my body....does that make sense?  Also, my lump sight is quite swollen and bruised - how do I know if it is a seroma and needs draining? Also, I'm a bit lost re wearing a bra - is it a good idea or not?  So far I haven't worn one at all as all my bras are underwired.  Any advice on all of the above appreciated! Thanks in advance and I hope you're all doing as well as possible today! HUGS xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone!  Thank you so much for all of your advice - it makes such a difference!  It seems like there's always a few gaps in the info that you get from the professionals....no one gave me any advice on bras as I would have gone looking BEFORE surgery! oh well....I'm sending my mum on a shopping trip tomorrow and we'll return any not needed!  I will also look in to the links you've all provided if I have no success in the High Street. I also spoke to a breast care nurse today and she seems to think that my swelling/bruising sounds normal.  I have opted to have my dressings taken off by my practise nurse at my Dr's on thurs so I can also get everything checked out then.  Feels a bit odd that no one has seen it since I left the hospital on thurs! The nurse also said to listen to your body and sleep/rest if needed. I have allowed myself to give in to the tiredness today and have just lounged around and have felt so much better for it!  Easier when the Boyf is at work as he's always trying to get me to get up and get on with it! Men! ;) I've been using the old trick of hitting the sofa with a rolled up newspaper to get out my anger!  Works a treat! Thanks again for all of your replies! x",

Thank you so much for your speedy replies!  Do you all spend the day on the computer??? ;) Everything has been so odd since my diagnosis - so many ups and downs of emotions already!  Today I am really freaking out about dying!  At 35 you don't expect to be facing such a thing. Also I wanted to ask you guys...about how quickly a diagnosis of Stage 1 can become stage 2, or 3 etc etc. When I have my first MRI this week will I get results from that straight away? I feel like I can cope with the diagnosis I have at the moment - small lump, surgery, radiotherapy - but I am freaking out about it spreading somewhere else! I guess having the initial rough diagnosis of fatty necrosis changing so quickly to cancer I am freaking out that every time I have an appointment it's going to be worse news.  I know that you probably don't have the answers to these questions but I needed to get them out of my head! jenny x",

I am looking at a lumpectomy & radiotherapy.  I am 35 and am already a sufferer of M.E. so I've had it rough for ten years already.  I don't have children so I have also been referred to a fertility specialist just in case.
