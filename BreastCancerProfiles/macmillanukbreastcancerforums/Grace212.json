    "Content": "Hi Maria W i too have done the same being strong armed bullied was how my oncologist behaved. Even to the point of adding additional personal comments when writing to my Gp.  I don\u2019t have a problem with conventional but the blinkered outlook tells me I am on a conveyor belt.  My diet lifestyle mindfulness etc. all created a gap in my immune system why and how was it compromised? How do I rebuild it? Having chemotherapy would reduce it further and my body would be exposed even more when I was sitting going through everything with the nurse I stopped counting at 21 when it came to risks \u2018but we have medication for that\u2019 was said at the end of each sentence all medication comes with side effects... [Edited by Admin] Why do blue zone areas around the world have lower risks and lower risks of recurrerance? I am responsible for myself and my choices chemotherapy does not cure but can help slow progress this can also be done in some cases via functional medicine too quality of life for me is better than to go through excruciating pain mental, emotional and anxiety.  Stress is a known cause of cancer feeding off those chemicals.   Please note that this is my own personal opinion and I am not judging anyone chemotherapy as said can help but I have opted out. i wish you well on your journey stay blessed  ",
