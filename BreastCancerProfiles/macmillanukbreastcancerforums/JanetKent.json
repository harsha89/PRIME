      "Content": "Hi - I have just been reading all your comments.  I finished chemo in October but then had radio that finished in Jan and still making me tired.  I too put on weight during chemo - I blame the inactivity and all I fancied to eat was sweet things!  Really want to get the weight off now and start to feel better about myself.  Good to see there are others out there feeling the same way.  I tried to join Slimming World on line tonight only to be told at the end of registration that they couldn't take people with cancer - great!  I find it difficult exercise much due to the fatigue and I also have problems following axillary clearance.  Any hints on how I can shift this weight or will it just take time?  ",

      "Content": "Thanks for that G n J.  I guess SW are covering themselves and it makes sense - just frustrating for us!  Thankfully not on hormone tabs!  Was only on steroids for a few days at start of each chemo session but I guess they still had an effect.  If anything I thought I would lose weight what with sickness, the mouth symptoms and generally feeling awful!  ",
