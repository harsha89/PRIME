    "Content": "I had some counselling over the phone, with the cancer counselling trust, it's for a limited number of weeks. It helped me to talk. I feel that my experience of cancer will always affect my life and i have not fully moved on. I too want to begin a counselling course because i feel that there is limited places to go to talk bout cancer face to face in my area. I hope that you do find somewhere or someone to speak to and that you go onto become a counsellor, offering the much needed face to face, low cost, assistance.",
