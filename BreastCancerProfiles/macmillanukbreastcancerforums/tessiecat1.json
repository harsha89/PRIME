Had rads, still solid lump. Comes round to April this year and my first mammo, & eventually able to push for an ultrasound, which showed a small seroma.  That was drained and although still got the solid lump (seems smaller), it no longer hurts, can sleep on that side.  I'd always thought a seroma was squidgy/softer/sloshed around, and that a BCN should know the difference between a seroma and scar tissue. Humph!  Good luck anyway and keep pushing for an answer - you know how you feel. xxx",

Ha. Also, if you have hormone tabs like me now, I have found that losing the weight is really much more difficult.  However, am just at my target, having lost 8stone, so pretty happy about that.  Do give SW a go in time, as it really is about healthy eating and not a diet!!  Good luck to you through chemo and beyond.

The Doctor's Chemist wouldn't even order it, so went to Boots, who had promised they could get it. But ....  Every time I went into Boots I had to check before I left the shop, only to find it was a DIFFERENT BRAND. Grrr. I was told about making an appointment with the Pharmacist in Boots for a Prescription Check Up, only takes about 5 mins, but I was able to ask for what I wanted and explain why it was necessary.  The previous time I'd been in, the assistant had said 'oh, that costs £65, we can't order that'.  The Pharmacist said he would order it (never mentioned the cost, so I didn't either!), and he said as it had to be specially ordered,  he would order 6 months supply at a time and leave the other packs with my name on.  Good job my hubby was there as well, or I would have kissed him (the pharmacist that is!). Rather annoys me that we have to go through all this palaver, but got there in the end, rather like my wittering on here.  Do hope you can get the Accord brand without any further trouble, just stick to your guns. Arrgh, side effects  - needless to say I've now got osteoarthritis in spine and hands, which I've put down to the anastrozole - even though also taking Adcal D3, which is supposed to help that. Got my second DEXA scan in April, so will see then what damage has been done from 2 years ago. xxx",

      "Content": "Hello Kazash, could have written your letter myself! Been 2 years on anastrozole, now found to have osteoarthritis, particularly bad in spine. Have had second DEXA scan which showed worsening osteopenia (have been taking Adcal D3) and nearly 2\" height loss. Took myself to Oncs and now taking bisphosphonates and told to change from anastrozole to either tamoxifen or exemestane. As I'm post menopause decided against tamox and will be taking my first exemestane tomorrow (that is of course if Boots will eventually have it in stock!!).  I've also had tendonitis in thumb, had corticosteroid injection which has sorted that out. I take 20mg amitriptyline at night and now get to sleep, and can get through without waking up with back/leg pain - do need to get up for loo, but able to get back to sleep - something I had not been able to do for months.  Have put EVERYTHING that is now wrong with me down to the anastyzole (even though it could be me now at the great age of 63).  It seems to be the devil or the deep blue sea - even the exemestane give side effects of joint pain. ARRGHGHGH, so does the bifossywhatsits - took my first one Monday (and shush -  managed to sit/stand for 1/2 hour and didn't feel nauseous, or have any other pains, perhaps I shouldn't look at the side effects leaflet, but so far so good). I saw a BCN, even though I'd asked to see the Onc, and BCN had to go rushing off and see Onc for advice, then thrust the tamox & eme leaflets at me, said to make up my mind & ask my doc to prescribe them, no info on the bifossy at all, moan, whinge, and moan again. Still, I'm still here and even though I'm like a crab getting down the stairs in the morning, movement does ease up after a while.  Am doing lots of exercises to improve bone strength and keep muscles moving.  Don't really feel much back pain due to the amittrip - which I find amazing, but it did work.   Oooh, have wittered on far too long. Hope some of it gives you some help.  My doc has been fantastic, always with the belief that 'something can be done about pain', so very grateful to her - she's been more help that BCN!   You should not have to continually suffer pain like that. Do you have a good doc? Hugs to you. Let me know how you get on. xxx",
