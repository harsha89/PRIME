      "Content": "Oooh that's a good tip re: steroid before 4pm -  mind if I pinch it? It's 5pm atm but still a vast improvement over the horrendous 10pm I took it last time. Just seen oncologist before chemo tomorrow. My first Docetaxol three weeks ago has shrunk the lymph node in my neck by almost 50% and he thinks it may well have done the same with the liver mets but obviously can't be sure. I cried when he told me and he put his arm around me - I really feel he cares, unlike the sadistic ***** I saw last time with AC. He thinks my liver is a little annoyed but not due to the mets = more likely chemo related. So after a bit of research I've started myself on milk thistle tablets to try to soothe it a little - can't hurt and if it means avoiding having to lower the dosage as he suggested, it's worth the money. It's already got rid of the indigestion I've had for precisely 3 weeks tomorrow so that's added icing to my cake of a day. No doubt I shall not be so cheerful tomorrow on the second dose but I think I can happily cope with any side effects it has to throw at me, now that I know it's working. Hope everyone else is doing well and that there's a little good news for everyone this week.",

      "Content": "Re nails: I HAVEN'T tried this so don't know if it works - however I personally think it's worth a try and am doing it tonight.  I have black nail polish a-plenty 'cos I'm one of those weirdo black clothes/makeup people so I'm doing that. I also have some (don't know if I'm allowed to post link but googling \"UV protect nail varnish\" should lead you in the right direction. I have the one on Amazon and it's currently £6.19 but it may be cheaper elsewhere. My thought is that if it's the UV rays causing the damage to the nails then if this blocks UV light from reaching the nails then it's worth trying. (for me, at least. Use at your own risk though I can't see how it would hurt - it's only a top coat.) It protects nails from yellowing due to UV rays - now I didn't buy it for that - I bought it to try to protect white vintage Star Wars figures from bromification (yellowing in the sun) but never got round to it. I'm digging it out and sticking it over the top of my black. Like I say, I have no idea if it works and won't be able to report back for three weeks but it may be worth a try if you come across it cheap enough somewhere. ",

      "Content": "I wish I could hug you too. I don't normally do hugs - I specialise in the kick up the backside method but you sound like you need a  hug. I was terrified 15 years ago when I did AC - I had a phobia of vomiting (thanks doggies!) not just your average dislike but a true, \"oh god someone's drinking alcohol on TV - are they gonna throw -  change channels NOW or I'm heaving\" phobia so was dreading it. But I overdosed on the metaclopramide, drank so much ginger ale you could smell it through my skin and i sailed through it.  This time I had specific fears - blood clots, mainly because that's what my mum died of - but once I spoke to the nurse, told her I was about to move into minor panic mode because of the blood clots, she sat me down and explained the signs, what to do, what they would do and you know what? I felt so, so much better about that, stopped worrying and went back to attempting to break the world record for cans of ginger ale held in one under-counter fridge. I think what I'm saying is forewarned is forearmed  and knowledge is a great weapon against fears - the chemo nurses are brilliant and pass on all these little tips and tricks that they've heard from the other ladies and they can really allay your fears in the meantime. It's hideous, yes. It's horrendous. There will be times when you swear you can't do it - but then you remember WHAT it's doing for you and you will decide it's worth it. I look back at AC now and honestly, I say it was a walk in the park. My overwhelming memory/impression is that it was like a massive hangover minus the headache - queasy, tired, couldn't think straight, thirsty.....but four months of that scored me 15 years cancer-free so when the oncologist asked if I wanted to do docetaxol I not only said yes but put a please and thank you very much on the end.  The AC didn't get much worse as time went on. I got more tired and more fed up at being denied blue cheese but the other effects pretty much stayed the same. I was told this is the same for most chemos, barring hair/nail loss. Will you be yourself again? Only you can answer that but for me, I can say I'm not. I still have dark circles from back then and I still have weak nails but mentally,  I changed for the better. Little stresses that would have sent me into a tailspin have just sailed past me for the last 15 years. There was a long power cut because of snow. My neighbours were running around like headless chickens. Me, I just shrugged and got on with it. I know there's worse things out there than missing Eastenders and having to eat a sandwich for tea. I went out and did things I wanted to do and had always wanted to do. I do think that in that respect, it changed me for the better. I think you will find that you come out the other side still \"you\" but stronger and with a deeper appreciation of the mundane.  You can do it. I was the whiniest baby ever and I did it. ",

      "Content": "She says the milk thistle won't hurt but might not help. It's cured my indigestion so it's a bonus to me anyway - I read somewhere that antacids can be bad for liver damage - blocking bile or something and as i said, whilst I don't have liver damage, I treat the mets as though it is when considering alcohol, meds etc. It just makes me feel I'm doing something myself - probably not but a positive mental attitude can't hurt. I feel ok today - tired, but that's the steroids not letting me sleep. Better without the cold cap - it was thinning anyway so no regrets. It's had the hell  bleached out of it so a refresh is probably a good thing.  My dad just dropped the bombshell that he has bowel cancer and btw he's off to Skegness in the AM so I can't even go and see him or read his information - he's very vague abut the whole thing. Says'it's curable but I have my doubts given his age and habits and family history. I feel so bad - what do I do? He only has me and whilst I will do everything I can, we all know how chemo works. Hope we're all doing well today, anyway. Sorry to just bang on about me - off to catch up now.",

I sort of had to really gulp to get food down - sort of a power-gulp! Someone advised me to try a spoonful of honey before each meal - I tried it but it didn't really work although it did see off a minor indigestion issue. I never found out what caused it or how to alleviate it but I drank a lot of cup-a-soups, Horlicks and Bovril/Marmite along with eating things like ice cream, tinned fruit,  porridge, yoghurt and rice pudding. I lost a little weight but I could easily afford to do so.  My go-to sickness remedies include sucking a frozen grape or sipping ginger ale (not beer.) I hope it gets better for you - it's not nice at all. ",

The first round wasn't fun - but if the second is the same, no problem. It's bearable. I know the odds are that it will be worse because of accumulation but I can at least hope. No hair loss as yet - cold cap may be working. No nail loss as yet. A little weight loss - easily affordable but keeping a (sore) eye on it anyway. Hot/cold and very thirsty which interfere with a good night's sleep but in the  grand scheme of things, not major. Leg pain - horrendous but brief and gone now, thankfully.

      "Content": "Hi Weeblemum - I will check but I got the idea from an American study where they gave 50 children with cancer milk thistle and 50 children with cancer a placebo. The milk thistle group had much better liver function tests and a significant increase in the number being able to tolerate the higher rate chemo instead of having the dosage lowered like the placebo group so I think it's worth trying - however I will check with the chemo nurse today. Thank you so much for the concern  - it's much appreciated. I didn't see any contraindication but as you say, it's always worthwhile checking.  I also looked into quinine for cramps but I ruled it out because it suggested it wasn't to be taken by people with liver damage. I don't have liver damage as such but when it comes to tablets, alcohol and so on I pretend that I have liver damage. No sense straining it further and what are liver mets if not some sort of damage?! For the cramps I found a couple of flannels in the dryer/on the radiator and then placed on my calves did wonders, as did a banana but if your potassium/magnesium levels are normal then the banana may not help.  Thank you so much for the best of luck - I'm looking forward to it in in a weird way. I'm expecting it to be better now I've made the decision to dump the cold cap and swerve the resultant three day headache plus the extra hour sat there looking like something out of Star Trek and plus, this one will make it a third of the way done. Plus - retail therapy after! I allow myself a tiny treat spend as a reward for getting through it - today I think new jammies are on the cards!",

I had chemo on the Thursday and on the Saturday night, I was sitting watching Casualty in the same position I always sit - sort of on my left hip and thigh - and I got the most horrendous deep bone ache in both hips that intensified until I gave in and took a naproxen anti-inflammatory. It continued on and off for a while and made me waddle from side to side like a penguin. It did make it hard to walk any distance. I also got stabbing pains in the shins that were intense but momentary. I'm not really the age to expect arthritis so I believe it's the chemo. I hope you find a solution - it isn't nice and just, to me, served as a reminder that I'm ill when I'm really trying to ignore it all and carry on as normal. ",

He said it wasn't overly concerning, but if it continued, he may lower the dosage. I want to swerve that at all costs because the first high dose shrunk my neck lymph node by a good chunk.  Google tells me that he meant my liver has high enzymes because of the chemo. Dr Google also tells me that coffee, green tea, fish, avocado etc can clear the enzymes. My question: If I overdose on the aforementioned coffee, green tea etc, and clear the enzymes, am I just hiding the damage from him or am I actually helping my liver cope with the chemo? Like am I wallpapering over the crack  before selling the house instead of getting the pink finish out?  Thanks if a) you understood what the heck I'm on about and b) have any thoughts. In other news, what the hell happened to my tea? It tastes like rusty spanners. As a 20 mug a day woman, (yes, twenty, 2x10, 2-0 - no typo) I'm devastated! Haha!

      "Content": "Glad you survived it. I found it much easier than the original cap but it didn't seem to work for me. That said, my hair was in very poor condition - I'm no stranger to fortnightly powder bleach and daily heat tools plus I could sit on it (haven't had it cut for years) so I expected it. Ah well, it was in such bad condition that it could do with starting again. Every cloud has a silver lining - ooh - silver. I have some metallic silver hair dye that I never got round to using - was scared it would look daft. Now's my chance to use it on what's left - if it looks ridiculous, no matter - it'll probably be all gone by next week. BRB......   I've chatted to other ladies who haven't abused their hair to this extent and they still have most of their hair if not all. One has to wear a strategic flower clip in her hair where the cap didn't quite touch one part properly so I think the trick is to make sure it touches all of your roots/head. Hopefully it works for you. Had my third  chemo yesterday. One the last steroids have been resentfully gulped tonight, I shall be halfway through - for now. :)",

      "Content": "Hiya - yes, you have to wear the cold cap every time you have chemo. I wore it the first time with AC but it gave me a blinding headache and I ripped it off after ten minutes - this was the old cap though that came straight out of the freezer.  Now I'm on Docetaxel and I wore the cap for the first round. It wasn't THAT bad - now it's a pumped antifreeze filled cap and if you can get through the first ten minutes, you'll be OK - the headache goes away. I didn't bother for the second round because a) my hair had started falling out anyway and  b) it adds an extra hour on to your treatment time.",

      "Content": "Fifth out of six Docetaxel complete. Had it on Thursday and doing OK so far - funny taste - tea tastes like dishwater but other than that, doing fine. I have to say it was made much easier by the CT scan results showing that the metastases are all \"significantly reduced\". Amazing how that news can make the chemo seem so much easier to deal with.  Hope everyone else is doing OK and that the side effects are leaving you all alone!",
