      "Content": "Hi, don't think I am using this correctly but here goes, I had a right breast Mastectomy 6 weeks ago was healing nicely until drain removed after 10 days and an infection set in and I was back in hospital on IV drugs, since then and after discharge from Hospital the scar is more painful, I can feel where the drain was in my back. But worst of all I was coping emotionally until the day before yesterday, now I am crying all the time and I am completely exhausted. Is this normal? Hopefully someone can help.",

      "Content": "Callie69 Hi Headwitch Like you, I didn't discover the on-line community for a while. I'd had the op, chemo and rads before i joined, just left with Herceptin and Tamoxifen now. I don't post very often but I check the discussions obsessively every day !! I think it helps to put things into place just knowing that there are others are out there. Hope you can enjoy the weekend.",
