      "Content": "Hi everyone So I had my 6 month follow up yesterday ( 7 months post op) My consultant noted that the breast I had the op on is bigger than the other, hadn't really noticed but do now, ( always been an A so don't mind bit extra but is this a normal thing to happen after lumpectomy/radio? I also asked him about the yellow crusty stuff on this nipple, he said for 1 in 100 it could be cancer in the milk ducts but said he wouldn't investigate further till my 1 yr mammogram in August as it might settle down and be nothing, not exactly reassuring BUT am refusing to worry. 7 months on am feeling great despite the TamoxifenðŸ˜„ Thoughts with you all Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi Sandi i had a lumpectomy last October and rads in January so one year down the line and all wellI too have lumps around my scar. My consultant said it is scar tissue and I am seeing someone about having some laser treatment on it as it is still a bit stiff and still a bit sore to touch. Always best to check it out but just wanted to tell you of my experience God bless Sue x",

Good luck with your results, hope the anxiety gets sorted Thanks for the reply xx",

      "Content": "Thankyou! I asked the pharmacist today and she said that magnesium is fine with tamoxifen. I have bought magnesium citrate which is apparently the purer form, hoping it will help with the tiredness/cramp and muscle aches, worth a tryEsp when I googled lack of magnesium and I seem to have almost all of the symptoms Sue xx",
