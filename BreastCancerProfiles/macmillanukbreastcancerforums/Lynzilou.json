She still has the drains in, which are really uncomfortable, and the muscle which they transferred from her back twitches every time she sneezes - have you read about that during your research?  There is so much going on all the time isn't there?  You think that the mx is the end of the upheaval, but there are extras!! In the meantime we are dreading Monday - each time we hae been to see him he has had disturbing news............ Thanks for your help Love Lyn x",

I saw an American site on Google which had special tops with pockets at the hem to carry the drains, but I can;t find anything in the UK which is similar,  but I suppose I can save a bit by using a supermarket plastic bag!  Thank you for that tip! I suppose she will be sore and restricted in movement for quite a while?  When you say \"my hospital\" - is it as a patient or nurse/doc? Thank you for your good wishes, I really do appreciate your contact. Lynxx      ",

Good luck for Monday, keep strong xxx Love Lyn  ",

I so agree with you about getting rid of the lump, we feel the same way and just want it out.  It's great news that your lymph nodes are clear, that must be such a relief for you. And chemo - yes, horrible to go through, but you know that it is really finishing off everything else.  And, I suppose the Winter is the best time to be wearing a wig with it being cold!

I have just phoned the ward, but she is still in theatre - that's 4 and half hours so far, and the nurse said she will probably be in recovery for a couple of hours afterwards, so we may not be able to see her for the 3.30pm visitng time and have to wait for tonight. How did your mum cope?  I am finding it so difficult too.  It should be me, not my daughter. It's great that you did not have a lot of side effects with chemo - we have been told about ladies who have been sick all day long and so tired they can only lie on the settee all day - I suppose it's a lot to do with how you view it all, you have such a positive attitude - are there different types of chemo?   I don't know a lot about that stage, I have had enough problems trying to come to terms with the mastectomy. Talking to you is good therapy - thank you for taking the time and trouble, I do so appreciate it. Love Lynxx",

My daughter has still got the drains in, over a week later, and thankfully, the fluid seems to be less consistently.  In the first couple of days, one of the drains was less, and you are optimistic, then the following day it's back up again!    I agree that it is best to keep the drains in as long as possible, the alternative is for the district nurse to extract the fluid daily with a syringe - and needles are not our favourite item in the world - I know you agree with that! We saw the surgeon on Wednesday, and he is happy with his work, altho' the recon is a completely different size and shape.  We are having the post mx results next Monday, so once again, we are counting down the days and waiting........... there is such a lot of waiting isn't there?

Also, a chair by the side of the bed is a good idea.   My daughter is worried about sleeping because she is having the back flap recon. op at the same time as the mastectomy, so her back as well as her front is going to be sore - the drains on a chair is one less thing to worry about.
