You shouldnt be worried whether you think you should be here or not-when you are worried about something like results for a test its always good to have some like minded people you can turn to! Just take each day as it comes and keep yourself occupied to try and take your mind off it. Good Luck and i hope everything turns out for the best, Best Wishes, Em xx",
