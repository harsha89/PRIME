      "Content": "Hi Daydream thank you for your thoughts and kindness. I do think quality of life is more important and that is why I am at this point because I feel ok considering what's happening to me but I know as soon as I start the new treatment that will change and I don't feel ready to do that.  I hope you cope well with your treatment when it starts and your brother too it must be so hard for you coping with all that's going on and I wish you strength and love.  (((((Hugs))))) from Redd xx ",

      "Content": "I saw onc on Friday was told I would need to start a new chemo regimen as the previous two have not kept cancer at bay. I had breat cancer 9 years ago and had lumpectomy chemoand rads and all was good. Last march 2016 it was back and spread I had chemo which knocked me off my feet but I got through it I had mastectomy and lymph nodes removed but couldn't have rads. I was put on another chemo and was told on Friday this isn't working so I will need to start another different chemo.  I feel as though I've had enough and am thinking no more. I don't want my family to see me going through this constantly and I don't want it for myself as I know it won't go away and I'll be having treatment for the rest of my life no matter how long it will be. I'm sure people will think I'm wrong to feel this way and I should fight harder but I am oh so tired of it all. I put my words here as I don't want to share my feelings with people I know. ",

      "Content": "Thanks Caroline, Mags and Sue for all your thoughts and words. I have decided to speak to my onc but getting her secretary to call me is always a waiting game as I've found in the past. This just adds to how I'm feeling so I'll make another call tomorrow and leave yet another message and see what happens. So annoying grr.  Last march after I had been diagnosed I was given Taxotere/Carboplatin it was so hard and I felt so ill I missed most of summer as I was in bed under a duvet freezing or in the bathroom doing what we do, I said I wouldn't go through it again after the first time 9 years ago but I did and it was awful. Radiotherapy wasn't an option and I had a mastectomy which I have coped with quite well, no reconstruction. After scans and blood tests the chemo wasn't too successful so I was put on Capecetabin an oral chemo my dose had to be reduced as my blood count was affected and was feeling ok but could feel the nodes in my neck were growing which I knew wasn't good, although one of doctors I saw a few weeks ago asked If I'd lost any wait as this would make nodes appear bigger ( I haven't lost weight) and swore not to see him again as I felt he wasn't listening to me. Anyway I saw my onc on Friday and was told to stop taking the Capecetabine as not helping and I should start a new chemo Erubulin which will have similar effects to the first lot. I really don't want it as it's just another drug that won't succeed but I do want to speak to my onc regarding my doubts.  I'm waiting for a bone scan as my ribs and back are causing me pain I know I have hot spots in the sternum from previous bone scan, I also have two tumours in the brain which were picked up from previous scan which totally shocked me but apparently they are benign and slow growing but due to me having vision problems and becoming clumsy I'm having another head scan. I know it could just be chemo brain and age related as my husband says but we will see. It's all too much to take in and at present I am in a fugue and feel very lost.  I'm sorry to be so negative and I really am not a negative person ( honestly) and thought I was doing ok and getting on with things and feeling lucky to be feeling so well considering! I've now hit a brick wall.  Thank you all for your support I know you are all experiencing your own battles and wish you all well. xx  Redd xx ",
