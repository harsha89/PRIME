    "Content": "after having my lumpectomy and a few lymph nodes removed ,i am now getting worried as to what i will be hearing on 11th december. Concerned that the cancer may have gone to lymph nodes, i have been quite possitive but my emotions still all over the place,i work in a large suppermarket and feel i carnt be the jolly and smiley person my job warrents me to be, especially at this time of year  when everyone is rushing about and getting bad tempered,it will just take that one person to be grumpy and horrible and i know i will just loose it . Had my surgery two weeks ago tomorrow hopefully my g.p. will sign me off ,i carnt cope with work just now.",
