      "Content": "Hello, just wondering if anyone has any advice regarding travel insurance. My mum was diagnosed with breast ca in may 2011, had surgery, radiotherapy and is now on the hormone tablets. My sister and I have arranged for her to go to America for a holiday to visit my sister and when trying to get insurance I was shocked to hear what price was being quoted (in excess of £300) for a 19 day trip, almost as much as the flights :( It just seemed as soon as I mentioned cancer, they either wouldn't cover or the price was extortionate! I realise that America is pricey for insurance, just wasn't expecting that! Anyone had similar experience? Thank you! X",
