      "Content": "Hello all. Im a 38 year old woman who has had my 5th baby 10 weeks ago today. I was breast feeding at 1st on and off for about 2/3 weeks but decided to just bottle feed. I think my baby was 5 weeks old when i found a lump and was getting pain in my right breast.  I went doctors and he thought it was a blocked duct due to milk and breast might of been infected. So he gave me some penicillin of which I wasn't taking all the time due to forgetting. So I noticed it was aching still on and off over the weeks and the lump was still there. As I noticed my partner was feeling my breasts during special time I was getting anxious. We was also having unprotected sex so weeks went past and I was starting to feel nauseous in the mornings which made me think I was pregnant again. So last week Thursday I went back to doctors because the lump is still there. She felt it and bought another female doctor in to feel too. She also said that the previous doctor that gave me the penicillin shouldn't of given me that and should of referred me then. She said its mobile the lump and not still but if was still could be more sinister. So she's referred me to the breast clinic at my local hospital for 8th February. But what I forgot to mention was I've been feeling sick every morning without fail for the past 3/4 weeks. I've just finished my 1st period since given birth so I know I'm not pregnant. I've been looking online that breast cancer can spread to the liver and can cause nausea which can be worst. Is this true? I'm so scared. Having to wait till next week and then finding out if it is cancerous is frightening. All I can think about is what if it is? What about my children? Will I get to see my 10 week old grow up? I'm so scared all I can think about",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissie39 thank you for your kind message. I forgot to say I have absolutely no milk left and no pregnancy hormone so don't think I'm hormonal. But you are right I have to stop googling. I just don't know where this nausea has come from.",

      "Content": "Hello mistymoley. I didn't think anything about it being breast cancer until after last week when I had my first period. But like I said before I was experiencing nausea a few weeks before when I thought I was pregnant. I finished my period yesterday and am still waking up every morning feeling sick. I dd do a test around 2 weeks ago and that was negative so I don't have the pregnancy hormone still. I might do another test but I doubt I am. I just hope this lump has something to do with my pregnancy and changes to the  breasts after. Thank you for your advice and I will keep you posted.",
