Our middle boys sobbed about an hour after and when I hugged him he said he was scared something bad was going to happen my reply I'm fucking terrified but I will be OK.  Kids are resilient and they will bottle things up and one day they just start talking.  ",

      "Content": "Violet blue Hi all, I've recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm 37, and after having various tests it appears that have two areas of my breast that need to be removed. My consultant talked me through my surgery options, and even before that appointment I felt that a mastectomy was the right choice for me.  But I'm scared, it's a big deal losing my breast. Absolutely reconstructive surgery is amazing, but it won't be the same. Can anyone share anything about how they made their decision, and if you had any regrets or anything you'd do differently. I know each case is different. I still feel young, my breasts make me feel feminine, now I'm having doubts if I'm making the right decision.  Any advice is welcome x Hi I'm the same age as yourself I had a diep flap surgery in November.  I had a mastectomy and reconstruction on the 3 November they used the fat from my stomach to reconstruct my breast.  I don't regret my decision it was the best option for me.  Yeah I have a scar from hip to hip and yeah I have a fantastic boob.  I have no nipple has it was all connected to my breast cancer.  I am seeing my consultant at the end of this month to make sure he is happy with everything and to discuss having my other breast lifted and filled to make them the same size.  Yeah it is hard to look at at first but once the swelling goes down it looks good.  If you any advice please get in contact  xx ",
