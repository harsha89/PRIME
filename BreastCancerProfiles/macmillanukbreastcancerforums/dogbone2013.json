      "Content": "Hi i have only this wk been diagnosed with breast cancer..a great shock and alot to get my head round it really confused by the outcomes of what they intend to do.  Apparently they did not expect to find cancer of this type.. phyllodes tumours...telling my husband and daughter was the hardest..I have to go back in 2 wks to have an operation .. being the main earner has added a lot of preassure in terms of i only went back to work this wk after 25 days..and with winter coming it really bothers me knowing I wont be able to fill our tank up for heating throught he winter..My husband tries to make light of things by saying its not important...but being a born worrier to me it is...Guess everything to deal with ontop of depression which I already suffer is bringing me down despite I put on a brave face....",

      "Content": "I have already had 1 op on the 27 August  thats how they found out that i had a rare form of cancer...they said they are removing the lump and tissues far back to the marging and hope they have removed it all... it is Cancer they had said ive got..cause i had to have them repeat it to me.. I will read up on it even though I was given info by the macmillan nurse present at the time of being told..she is great guiding me an all..I just thought It would be nothing cause this lump ive had since 1987 and ive had it checked regularly..only this time it was bigger that usual and slightly uncomfortable which is why they removed it...even they did not excpect me to have it...but thanks i will look at this info..",
