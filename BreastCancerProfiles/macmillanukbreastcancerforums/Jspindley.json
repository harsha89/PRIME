      "Content": "Coastal-lady Hi everyone  Quick q if I may. I was diagnosed with stage 2 lobular BC in my left Breast last November. Since then I've had a mx (no lymph node involvement) & immediate recon, gave Chemo a swerve and went straight to 15 sessions of rads. I've been taking Anastrozole for the last 3 and a half months. I started with Accord brand but experienced sever joint pain - to the point where I could barely hold a pen & my 89 year old mother was getting out of a chair quicker thank I was. I also experienced severe rib pain. I switched to arimidex and the symptoms were much reduced. But last weekend the rib pain started again but this time on my RIGHT side. It's now v severe. And again I'm having problems getting out of a chair ( should I change my chairs ?!!) I'm pretty sure it's the ARIMIDEX but it is super painful & of course my normally subjective Brain has started to go into overdrive.I've started my phased return, but am now dreading long car journeys etc as I understand the OCCH Doc is quite unsympathetic. Anyway this is a long bc winded way of asking if anyone else has experienced the stabbing rib pain on ny version of Anastrozole plse ? I've been told repeatedly that I no longer have any cancer left after they removed my tumour- but with this pain, I'm imaging the worst ! Thanks for your help in advance.   Coastal-lady Hi everyone  Quick q if I may. I was diagnosed with stage 2 lobular BC in my left Breast last November.

Thanks for your help in advance.   Hi, my BC was identical to yours..After taking Letrozole for about 3 mths I was in so much pain with aching muscles and bones, felt like a 90yr old!..my oncologist suggested I took calcium and D3 but after I did a lot of research I mentioned to her that Letrozole may weaken my bones and that I needed Magnesium and K2 to help with the absorption of the calcium...I get these now on prescription after also educating my GP who didn't have a clue! Please try this combination and read up about Magnesium, it is an AMAZING supplement as it works with calcium absorption and is a muscle relaxant! After taking it for a week or two I had NO pain! I feel wonderful!...I have had replies from so many people who have suffered with terrible aching muscles, they have thanked me for this knowledge!..Don't worry! the pain is a side effect from Letrozole, Armidex, Anastrozole etc..I have never taken supplements in my life but believe me Magnesium will work for you! My GP was reluctant to give me it on prescription, I explained to him that it is given intravenously to people who have heart attacks, seizures etc as it relaxes your muscles, I also told him 80/90% of the population are deficient in Magnesium as we don't get it in our diet! He wasn't convinced my Letrozole had such horrible side affects! Thank god for the wonderful NHS but glad I did my own research!  Coastal-lady Hi everyone  Quick q if I may.

      "Content": "...my GP told me my bone scan was fine, I told him \"of course it is!..I had the bone scan at the same time I started my Letrozole and I am taking calcium!\" GPS are NOT knowledgeable about supplements...my second bone scan showed a deterioration! I insisted on the supplements and said I will stop taking the Letrozole if he didn't give me them as I am not suffering like that! To be honest if he had refused I would have just bought them 'cos they are my saviour!..the only one I pay for is K2, I am 63 and don't pay for prescriptions. My  Oncologist sent a fax to my GP saying I must have calcium D3, I then bought the Magnesium but can be expensive so now I get them on prescription, suppose it depends on your GP!... Hope all goes well! Coastal-lady So the GP thinks it's the Arimidex as my body settles into its new regime. I'll watch it like a hawk but hope the aches and pains do settle.  My GP wouldn't discuss any supplements until I have had a bone scan - which I get.  But to be ready to hit this hard when I have had it next month, I'd also be grateful for the details of the supplements mentioned plse !  Thanks again for everyone's replies. So kind of you to take the time. Onwards and upwards !  The supplements I take are: ADCAL D3 (calcium dosn't absorb without D3) LAMBERTS MagAbsorb VITAMIN K2 (from Holland and Barrett)",

      "Content": "I wrote on here a couple of years ago as women were saying the side effects of Letrozole were awful, i.e. Bone, muscle pain, no energy..I couldn't get out of bed or hold a cup of tea, it was unbearable...please believe me when I say MAGNESIUM is amazing! Please read up about it! I use LAMBERTS MAGNESIUM (they supply the NHS)..no more pain and lots of energy! I have been thanked by so many people!..I actually get my Adcal d3 and Magnesium on prescription. No disrespect to GPS but they are not clued up on supplements! ",
