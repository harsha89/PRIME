    "Content": "Hi Wendy I am so sympathetic! I used to work for a Spanish company and all the Spaniards wanted the heating on 26 degrees & all the Brits wanted 20. The office used to swing from ice station zebra to a swamp depending on who had fiddled with the thermostat last. If you\u2019re cold you can just put on more layers but if you\u2019re hot what can you do ... strip off all your clothes?!? Hope you get a good solution. Will they allow a desk fan if not? Our place doesn\u2019t allow anything that you bring in, so sometimes I\u2019m sweltering. x",
