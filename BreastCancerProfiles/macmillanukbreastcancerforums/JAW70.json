    "Content": "Hi Harridamen. Firstly,  just want to say big hugs. I'm quite a bit older than you (47) and lucky enough to have grown up children, I salute anybody going through this with small children. I was diagnosed with a right side 18 mm invasive ductal Grade three papillary breast cancer in early September last year,  with only 1/21 nodes involved. ER+ PR- HER2 -  my first thought was who's going to look after my cats! Then the kids, then the husband. I've got to get my priorities right. Personally, I found the not knowing and constant waiting the scariest part. Like you, I was also imagining it had spread everywhere and had pretty much written myself off. So, I had my mental wobble, screamed, cried and was generally awful to everybody around me then dusted myself off and tried to hold it together. Still not quite there yet but getting there slowly. I find the anti-depressants a great help. I initially had a lumpectomy at the end of September but the margins were questionable so decided on a mastectomy without reconstruction, I also had a full node clearance. As somebody has already mentioned, the nodes are there to catch such things and mine hadn't spread beyond the first one. Due to various reasons, I didn't have that done until the first of December. I found the operation surprisingly easy and felt ok but you need to pace yourself and keep up with the exercises they give you. Again, due to various reasons, I didn't start Chemotherapy until the 23rd January. Just had my second round of EC and currently rocking the Sinead O'Connor look :) I find the worst part of chemo to be the frustrating exhaustion so if effected this way, try and arrange extra support for you and your daughter.  The chemo nurses pretty much have a tablet for anything else. I've got another round of EC to go then nine weeks of Taxol, not sure about radiotherapy yet, then up to ten years of Tamoxifen. I'm one of those people who need to know every last detail about what I'm dealing with so was constantly on google, although at times it was a bit like watching a horror film, one eye closed behind the cushion and too scared to look at the screen. As somebody has already said, if you'd prefer not to know, stay off google. Don't look if ignorance is bliss.  Please find some support, sometimes all you need is somebody to listen and give you a hug. The breast cancer nurses are pretty good and can provide info on support groups etc. I'm not one of those people who likes groups of strangers so it's either close friends and family for me or on-line forums like this. I found once I had all the information and knew what was happening and when, I could (mentally) deal with it better. Signs of a control freak coming out I think? Once again, big hug, deep breath and kick its behind :) ",
