      "Content": "Hi KiwiCardi I just wanted to add that my mum had a mastectomy with lymph node clearance and she said that the pain under her arm was worse than the chest area. She is about 10 months on now and the pain has been gone for a long time. She did get down with the pain st first but picked up with painkillers and often one mild codeine at night. It will lessen. Hang in in there xx",

      "Content": "Hi Gina thank you for your help and hoping that your pain eases as quickly as possible. It's good to know about the drain not hurting when it is removed as someone, unhelpfully, said it would be very painful! I will sort out meals etc until she is feeling better and I suspect my boys are going to get a rapid introduction to 'how to do housework' Kusmi x",

      "Content": "Dear All My mum (78) is having a mastectomy with full node clearance next week and I wondered if anyone could tell me the best things I can do to help her and anything I should be careful not to do or look out for? I will be there for the first week and then my daughter will be around until the start of the new term but neither mum nor I really know what to expect and we don't know anyone who has had a similar op. Many thanks Kusmi",

      "Content": "Hi I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or has some advice? My mum noticed her breast had swollen and went to the GP. It was noticeably swollen, red, hot and had orange peel skin. Tests showed a 5cm mass with swollen lymph nodes. The skin by this time was deep red. After the op, the surgeon was amazed to find that only 3 of the 39 nodes removed were cancerous. The others were swollen but it wasn't cancer. No cancer was found in the skin. Now, 10 weeks later the redness is returning. It's on the chest area and a bit on upper abdomen. It's not infected and every time someone new sees it- such as the radio therapists- they look a bit concerned and say keep an eye on it. Â She's triple negative and turned down chemo due to her age. I can't find anything helpful on the Internet but if is is worrying, why does no one know what it is or seem to want to check it out further? It's paler in the morning than in the evening. Any thoughts appreciated. Kusmi",

      "Content": "Thanks- maybe I'll give the BC nurse a call. Yes she's having radio t but it was red before this. I thought things were getting easier but I think, as I say to my mum, it's a long haul kind of thing. She does have some lymphoedema but, I'm just concerned that redness was one of the initial signs right at the start. x",
