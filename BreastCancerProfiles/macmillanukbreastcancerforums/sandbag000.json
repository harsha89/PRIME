      "Content": "Thanks so much for your reply.Â  My mum has had an above the knee amputation. She is 68 years old and very frail from the chemo-she had every side effect possible from severe vomiting to horrible thrush in her throat and mouth. I just hope that she can cope with this latest setback. Thank you you have been very helpful. My mum lives in Oldham. Regards Sandra.",

      "Content": "Hi , An occupational therapist is doing a home assessment on Tuesday my sister will be there,so hopefully we will have a better idea of what needs to be done. My mum rang me this morning to say that she is in pain with phantom leg pains,but on the bright side she is no longer bunged up! The oncologist has spoken to the nurse in charge of mums cancer treatment to say that the chemo can start again at a later date but my mum will not hear of it- and to be fair I don't blame her. Thanks for reading this. Cheers Sandra.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I could do with some practical advice. Here is a brief description of my mum's situation. She has breast cancer and was having chemo.Unfortunately she developed blood clots in her leg and had to have it amputated on Tuesday this week. My sister and I are both so worried that she will not be able to go home and will be put somewhere where she does not want to be. She lives alone and I live miles away. Her life has been about walking her dog and meeting her dog loving friends and if she can no longer do this she will be devastated. Is there any practical help out there. My mum is refusing to have any more chemo or the planned herceptin treatment.We are obviously very worried as well on how this will impact on her chances of survival. As a family this has devastated us. Thanks for reading this.",
