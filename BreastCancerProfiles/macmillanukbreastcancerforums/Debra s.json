      "Content": "Hi Jules, I had the LD Back Flap Reconstruction last July.. I asked my Surgeon to try to do it without putting in an implant (not that I did not want one but just thought it was something else to go wrong !!). Anyway Op was 8 hours long.. I woke up feeling not bad. Was attached to a Morphine Pump - which I only ever pressed once ( when I got confused with light switch lol).. I can honestly say whilst I was obviously aware of the operation I never had any real pain. Was only on Paracetomol.. Was in hospital for 6 days. I was a bit shaky afterwards and it took me a while to get my strength back. I had 3 drains in.. Two were taken out before I left hospital and remainder was in for 7 weeks !!  which did drive me mad must admit. But I put it in a bag and once I felt better put it over my shoulder and was out and about.. As said before you do have a large scar across your back.. I had some problems with scar tissue so was reffered to Physio which helped a lot.. To be honest I dont even think about it now..  In Dec 2011 I had a reduction, uplift on other breast,and nipple reconstruction. Was really pleased with results but was a bit disappointed that breasts were still significantly different size. When I saw my Surgeon he explained he could only reduce the other breast so much or it would go out of shape. So now I am booked to have an implant fitted in April.. I am quite surprised you have been told you cant have implant as you have had RT. I was advised not to have it before RT but was fine afterwards. I have never regretted having this operation... Anything you want to ask please do.. Regards Debra",

Compared to chemo R/T is a doddle !!! apart from being tired I had no side effects at all. I used the aqueous cream dilligently and also only used Simple Soap.. Worse thing really was the hanging about.. I changed my appointments till about 15.00 everyday as previously I was going at 13.00 so it limited what I could do in the morning.. There seemed to be a quicker turn around later.. I did find that my arm ached a bit (as it has to be in one position) mind you I could recite the measurements after a while !!!! Went back to work in July and am feeling very very well.. Best of luck Regards Debra  ",

      "Content": "Hi Chelle Hope all goes well tomorrow. I had chemo in 2010 (3 of FEC & 3 of Tax). Yes I felt exactly the same, scared but happy with the treatment starting. I had a good reaction to chemo, felt grotty first week but quickly improved and by 3rd week I was here there and everywhere !!! Just listen to your body and if you need to rest try to.. I used to drive to hospital and back. Did not used to kick in till few hours after. I am sure you have been told but FEC makes your urine go red for first couple of days ( just so you don't freak). I used to have a light meal before I went and just soup later. Remember to take the anti-sickness meds (even if you don't feel sick). Good idea to write stuff down, tell Doc your side effects and he can give you something or your meds may need tweaking. I did lose my hair after 2nd chemo but although I was dreading it,it was not as bad as expected. In fact when my own hair grew I used to miss that wig when I had to get up 30mins earlier to blow dry my hair !! I would have your holiday in Devon, but maybe best to wait till treatment is over before going abroad. Good luck, and let me know if you want any more info. Regards Debra",

      "Content": "Hi Roscoe & Jo My name is Debra, I was diagnosed in Nov 09 and had a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy. I finished treatment in June of this year. They took 9 lymph nodes and 2 were shown to have slight invasion. Although surgeon was happy all the cancer had been removed my Oncologist advised me to have a course of chemo \"just to mop up any little blighters\" followed by a 15 day course of radiotherapy. Doc said the radiotherapy was again more of a precaution, to the chest area. I was advised against having the reconstruction at same time as mainly as you say the radiotherapy can damage it. In fact when you sign the consent form for R/T it does say that.  I was also advised to wait at least a year after treatment as Docs had found your body copes with it better. I am hoping to have the back flap reconstruction next year. The worse part for me was leading up to the operation. Once it was over I felt it was\"out of me\". I started chemo 6 weeks later (6 sessions every 3 weeks). I was very fortunate in my reaction to chemo as I recovered very well. R/T was a doddle compared to chemo !!!  I went back to work in July and have been fine. I wont go on and on but anything you want to ask please dont hesitate. Regards Debra  ",

I did feel rough the 1st week but soon improved and by 3rd week was bombing round the shops. Whatever your side effects YOU must tell your Oncologist as they can change them or give you something. My worse side effect was Constipation. I found it better to have a light lunch before I went and then just some soup when I got home. I was never sick and found effects did not kick in for a few hours. When you have Tax you have steroids so you feel ok for first couple of days. Big hugs and good luck. Regards Debra",

Was then told 2 out of 9 lymph nodes were infected so was recommended to have chemo & radiotherapy. Started chemo 3 weeks later ( 6 sessions of Fec). I had a good reaction to chemo and did not feel so bad. Then had 15 days of RT. I waited a year and then had LD Flap recon. Which was amazing. I then had \"boob job\" on other breast. I found this was the worst time. Once treatment started I felt more in control. Pls ask if you want any more info. Regards Debra",

I was losing about 350 mls initially. It's what they call a \" closed wound drain\" so you come home. I had to have the District Nurse in and also had to see my Breast Care Nurse. As I said it was fine. Take a bag into the hospital and once you are able to get up just put them in the bag. Normally the Breast Nurse will give you a leaflet with excercises to do. I was then referred to physio which I went to for about 6 weeks. You wil probably see Breast Nurse and Physio whilst still in hospital. Take care Love Debra Xx",

When I got the results they took 9 nodes and 2 were infected although there was no spread anywhere else.. I think that apart from dealing with the diagnosis when you have never really had to go to the hospital throughout your life thats scary in itself ..  You are then confronted with all these appointments and tests. My Oncologist wanted me to have chemo more as a precaution and they like to start it about 6 weeks after operation. I think that when time pass's you will be grateful for the speed and the care you have received.. At the moment its all so scary.. Hope you get on ok today... Love Debra",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon, Glad you are coping, it is very difficult.. But definitely helps hearing from people who are/have going thru the same. I think the pamphlet re the excercises tells you the ones to do whilst in hospital and when you still have drains in. My nurse said best one was to do was like brushing your hair. I would imagine its quite difficult to wear a bra when you still have the drains in, I think I put one on about 3 weeks after the operation. I saw my nurse 3 days before operation and she gave me what they call a \"comfy\".. It has like cotton wool in so you take out or add to match your other side.. I was told I could wear this with my normal bra and sellotape a couple of 10p pieces to weigh it down. Personally I preferred to wear it with a proper mastectomy bra, as I found it moved around.  Yes the bra has a pocket  that you put the prothesis in. When it comes to the proper prothesis I was amazed how much time is taken over it. They like to wait till about 6 - 8 weeks after the operation (so any swelling has gone down). You are then measured exactly the same as other breast.. To be honest you would never know the difference now. They told me that if I put on weight/lose weight I can go back and have another fitting. I had to have chemo that started 6 weeks after operation. I have lost my dad to cancer 6 years ago and when he had chemo he was so poorly  - so I was absolutely dreading it. But in fairness it was not as bad as I had imagined. I was poorly 1st week, bit better 2nd and feeling relatively well the 3rd. Honestly - this was the worst time before the operation.. I remember leaving work the day before the operation and sobbing as I drove my car out, wondering if I would ever come back !!! Dont hesitate to ask anything else you want... Regards Debra",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon My name is Debra, I was diagnosed in Nov 2009, I had a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy. I finished treatment in June this year and have been back to work since end of July. I am hoping to have a reconstruction op next year. I know exactly what you meant about \"being in a fog\" from when I was diagnosed it was 2 weeks later that I had the op. I did work up to the day before, and now when I think back I I must have been in a daze. On the morning of the op I was pretty calm and luckily was 1st patient to be operated on. From when I woke up I just felt it was out of me !!. I never had any pain at all from the op, just had paracetemol and anti-inflammatory medication. I was up and about the next morning. I assume your breast cancer nurse has given you info on excercises ?? there are some that you can do immediately after operation. I religously did mine and have never had any problems with my arm. One thing I say is once you are up and about they will put the drains in a bag. I got a chair and put it by the side of the bed so the bag rested on that and I was not worried I would kick it off the bed in the night. My surgeon let me come home with the drains (which I was pleased as one drain stayed in for 2 weeks).I just had the District Nurse come in everyday to look at it. I was told I could drive after 4 weeks. My nurse said if I could do a 3 point turn without any pain then it was fine. I had the proper prosthetic fitted about 8 weeks later, and although I will be pleased to have the reconstruction op, the prosthetic is so good, no-one would notice. One blessing about having it this time of year (I had mine in dec 09) is that you wear coats and jumpers so if you dont want to wear a bra initially its not a problem. I would say to you to buy the proper mastectomy bra. Mine were from a company called Royce - which I got from Debenhams online. Best of luck for the op and if you want any more info please dont hesitate to contact me.. Regards Debra  ",

So with all the visits and questions it went pretty quick.  When I woke up I was attached to a morphine pump and saline drip. Both of these came off the next morning.. When I wanted to wee the nurse initially gave me a bed pan but I could not use it so got up and used a commode..  It was the best feeling in the world the next day when I could use the proper toilet !!! If your husband does visit you straight after, you are in a gown and blankets over you so no-one can see anything..  I did not want my Mum to come with me beforehand but she got herself in a right state so she did come..  As I was a long time in recovery she came and sat with me there..

I lost my hair with Chemo, since it grew back I have never really been that happy with it.. Tamoxifan has not helped and it's quite fine and thinning - especially on the crown. I have spent an absolute fortune on hair products in last 4 years and whilst some have been better than others, none I gave been really happy with. Whikst looking at Marks and Spencer Website I saw a 3 Step System from company called Swell. They did a trial size for £23.00 for shampoo, conditioner & root complex. So I bought it not really expecting a lot of difference. But I am so pleased with it. It took 3-4 washes for my hair to look better. It has much more volume and stays in the style for longer. My hair also looks thicker at the roots. It is not cheap but for me it has improved my hair. You can only buy it in certain M&S but can order from website. Amazon also sell it. Thought I would just pass this on.  Regards DEBRA",

The problem with chemo as apart from how it affects you 7 - 10 days after is when you are most susceptible to infection and that can be the dangerous bit. I am sure you have already been told if your temp goes up past 38 deg you must go straight to A&E. I think as its so close to end of term it might be better to take the time off. Saying that I had a really good reaction to chemo and by the 2nd week I was much improved. Having the summer holidays will give you a good indication of how your body will react. Regards Debra x",

Once they have got your correct diagnosis and you have a treatment plan it becomes easier to deal with. I remember feeling so ill and convinced it had spread but my Nurse said it was shock. Once I had the operation I felt \"IT\" was out of me.. I like you was told from the beginning the Surgeon thought it was 99% cancer. I could have hit him then - lol..  Now I think he is amazing.. Treatments are not easy, I was one of the lucky ones and had hardly any side effects from chemo.. Try to make a list of questions you want to ask as your brain goes to mush !!!

A year later I had LD Flap Recon, beforehand I had asked if it could be done without an implant (not that I had an issue about that but just though something else to go wrong). I was told I could have as long as I had a reduction on other side. I know what you mean about \"perfectly healthy breast\" but felt best option for me. So 4 months after recon I had the recon. When I woke up I could see there was still a significant difference. I was then told that breast can only be reduced so much as otherwise it goes out of shape  -  as you can imagine I was not happy as if I had been told that I would have had the implant.  I then had to wait over a year for my Health Authority to get the Lipofilling Machine. I had 2 operations for that  -  3 months in between. Although it made a difference the original recon had moved towards my arm.. Doc decided to reposition the reconstruction, I had that op in March this year and am so happy with results. So to answer your question I dont think its anything to do with your friend being a Nurse, its dependant on Doctor & Health Authority. When I had Lipofilling it was taken from my leg, but can be from tummy buttocks etc.. I think you have to try to pursue the Lipofilling as it does make a difference. Regards Debra",

I had Chemo & RT in 2010 and then a year after treatment finished I had a LD Flap Reconstructon. I asked for this without implants (if possible) as I just thought this was something else to go wrong. Surgeon said that was fine as long as I had reduction on other side. So thats what happened, I recovered well from Recon op. Had no real pain and got movement back pretty quickly. Had reduction later in 2011. Unfortunately I was never told that the breast can only be reduced so much otherwise it will go out of shape (I would have had implant if I had known that) So Breast was still significantly smaller than other one. I had 2 further lipofilling operations last year which although made a diference was still not enough. So finally in March this year Surgeon repositioned the reconstruction and I am very happy with the results. You will be offered a prosthetic to wear before Reconstruction. To be honest I was really impressed with the level of detail that went into the fitting of this, and it looked great. Despite the delays in sorting this I still feel it was the best decision for me to have a delayed reconstruction. Regards DEBRA",

Make sure you do your arm excercises as you have to keep your arm in one position, and whilst the actual treatment was only minutes it does take some time to get into right position.

When you ring later it may be worth asking whether you can go to Recovery to see her.. When I had the Mastectomy they told Mum she could come in there.. When I had Reconstruction she was told I would be back in Ward about 7.00pm so she got a taxi.. Sat in the Ward for a couple of hours and then Surgeon came to see me and he took her down to Recovery to see me. One of the weird things with the Recon is that it has to be kept at a warm temperature for a few hours after op.. I woke up to find, what I can only describe as a tumble dryer hose in the bed attached to a heater !!!  it was soooo  hot (as it was July). I had to ask them to turn it off as it was making me feel sick. My Mum did find it difficult, we had lost my Dad 8 years before to Cancer so when I first found the lump I did not tell her until I was diagnosed.. I think in retrospect that was a mistake as that upset her even more.. Once your daughter has had op you will feel better.. Chemo normally starts approx 6 - 8 weeks after Surgery. To be honest you are better dealing with one thing at a time. Once she is feeling better you will have the information meetings to go through it all. Hope she is ok (and you of course !!)..

      "Content": "Good Morning Ladies, I was diagnosed in 2009, had mastectomy. chemo, RT, Recon - I was 46 when diagnosed.. I started taking Tamoxifan in 2010, like most people my periods stopped during Chemo, had no further periods. In January 2013 I started bleeding slightly - nothing major so did not take to much notice. About 1 week later I suddenly had the most awful vaginal bleed, it lasted for a couple of days and then stopped completely. It did freak me out so I went to see GP. He said immediately I had to be referred to the hospital as any unexplained bleeding after not having periods for so long has to be investigated. I was even more shocked when I received phone call 2 days later for the appointment the next day at the Gynae Oncology Unit !!. By this time you can imagine how I was feeling, anyway went  hospital. Although Doc could not feel anything abnormal she said I had to have further tests a week later as they have to treat this as a possible recurrence.. So had an Ultrasound & Probe ( believe me BC Tests are sooo much more dignified !!). I then saw the Consultant a couple of days later. She told me that my Womb lining had thickened so they had to do an examination with a camera. She told me straight away that there was nothing suspicious but the Tamoxifan had caused Womb Polyps  - some had broken away and thats what had caused the bleeding. As you can imagine I was relieved. I was then booked in for a Womb Scrape, couple of weeks later. I spoke to my Oncologist who was going to change the Tamoxifan but my Estrogen Levels were to high. I have had a few incidents of bleeding since, so have been told the Polyps are growing again. So I would urge any of you that have had unexplained bleeding to get it checked out. Regards Debra",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I had mastectomy in 2009 and then reconstruction operation last year. My body \" loves\" drains.. After MX they were in for 2 weeks and after Recon was in for 7 weeks !! So became a bit of an expert !! As previously said you need short sleeve front fastening PJ!s. I got mine from M&S, Per Una. When you come round from operation drains will be attached to side of the bed. Once you are up and about I found best thing was a canvas bag from Primark that had long handles. You can pop drains in there and put bag on your shoulder. When you sleep get a chair beside the bed and put drains on that. So you are not worried about knocking them off. Once you come home district Nurse will come in to change bag and calculate the loss. It has to be less than 40 mls to come out. I had no problems at all with them. After Recon I just put them in bag and went out and about. Hope this helps, anything else please ask. Regards. Debra xxx",

All treatment finished in 2010..  I am now really well and feel fine.. This is the worst time, once they have agreed a treatment plan you know where you are..  Of course its normal to be shell shocked.. I remember a few days after diagnosis I went into complete shock and was convinced it was everywhere.. I lost my amazing Dad in 2004 to Cancer.. That I think made it worse initially as all I kept thinking about was him.. The treatments are amazing now.. I was told that if you were unfortunate enough to get this insidious disease Breast Cancer is the \"best\" one to get !!!..  Yes I did lose my hair in chemo but I felt to put up with 6 - 8 months of feeling crap that would hopefully entail me to live a lot longer its worth it..

To be honest for me the worse part was between diagnosis and the operation.. I got myself in such a state, everytime I had a pain I was imagining it had spread everywhere.. I had a long chat with my Breast Cancer Nurse and she said it was shock.. Once I had calmed down I felt better in myself.. Once I had the op I just felt it was out of me..I recovered very well from op and started chemo 6 weeks later, which although was not great I coped with it very well.. In my area (Essex) the operation has to be carried out within 4 weeks of diagnosis.. I waited 2.5 weeks... I was at a group meeting last week and a young girl 27, was there she also carried the faulty gene and had opted for a double mastectomy.. She was doing really well and just baout to have a reconstruction.. If anything you want to ask please dont hesitate.. Love Debra",

I had a CT Scan 5 days before the operation. I was absolutely terrified of the results as I lost my lovely Dad to cancer 6 years ago and he was diagnosed through a CT Scan. I asked the surgeon the morning of the operation, luckily all was okay..  I have learnt with this illness its not necessarily where you get it, its where it gets to... My surgeon did not want me to have the reconstruction straight away as he wanted to see if I needed further treatment.. I did have chemo and radiotherapy.. I will tell you that I had absolutely no pain at all from the operation. I was on a morphine drip when I woke up but that was taken away the next morning as I did not need it. I was up and about the next morning.. As I said before I feel really well.. I am back to see the Oncologist this afternoon for my 4 monthly check.. Feeling a bit jittery today bit think I will always feel like that now.. Hope you get your genetic results in time... Take Care Love Debra",

Once I had the op I felt it was out of me. I had a better reaction to chemo than I thought.. I lost my lovely Dad to cancer 6 years ago so for my poor Mum it was a terrible shock. So I can imagine how you are feeling about telling your parents. On the subject of your friends, you find out who are your true friends !!! a colleaugue of mine at work has been absolutely wonderful even though we were not that over friendly beforehand. I lost my hair after 2nd chemo, I did buy a wig beforehand and for me personally it was the best thing. I do think you have to deal with each stage as it comes. if you are having op first deal with that.. I was told before the op that they would have no results until 2 - 3 weeks after. I then saw the Doc and was told they recomended chemo and r/t. I had 7.5 months off work, went back in July and I have been really well.. Have had no lasting side effects from the treatment. I am hoping to have a breast reconstruction op next year. As you seem to have realised whatever your worry/query there is always someone on this site with some advice.. Take care Regards Debra",

I then saw the consultant, i think they have a meeting beforehand with Oncologists to discuss treatment. They took 9 lymph nodes and 2 were slightly infected.. Also did a auxillary clearance and was graded at 2. That was on the wednesday and I was given an appointment to see Oncologist on following Monday. He felt that the best course of treatment was chemo and radiotherapy, mainly due to my age (46).. They like to start chemo no later than 6 weeks after surgery. I did lose my hair and had decided to buy a wig beforehand..  Which for me was the best thing as I did not want people thinking about what I may have had.Everyone is different and you do whats best for you. I am still wearing it and have just made a hairdressers appointment for Dec to have my own hair done !! what I will say is that it was quite nice when I was not feeling that great just to come out of the shower and put my head on !!! I did find its best to deal with each stage as it comes along. So wont go into chemo (apart from was not half as bad as I thought) until you know what your treatment plan will be..

I like Tinkers had a pretty good reaction to Chemo, felt not that great first week, bit better 2nd week and relatively normal 3rd week !!! It does scare you all the known side effects but everyone is different.. I  cant really add more advice than Tinkers has done but as she said make sure you tell your Oncologist of every side effect.. I had bad indigestion but Doc immediately prescribed me something to take..  My worst side effect was constipation.. I used to have a swig of the mouthwash everyday and although mouth felt a bit furry !!  I never had any ulcers.. Make sure you take the prescribed anti-sickness medication, even if you dont feel sick YOU MUST continue taking it for the course. If you are going to have Taxotere (normally last 3 cycles) just be aware you take steroids for this just before chemo and whereas FEC has an effect within hours Taxotere (for me) took a couple of days to kick in.. Listen to your body and if you need to rest make sure you do..  I did struggle a bit with improving over the 3 week period and then knowing I was going to be unwell again.. But its a means to the end !! I then had 15 days of Radiotherapy, which was a doddle compared to chemo..  Since then I have had a breast reconstruction, then an uplift and reduction and am going into hospital this friday for an implant to be fitted.. It took some time to recover from treatments (and hair to grow lol) but now I feel really well.. Good luck Regards DEBRA  ",

If they are the same, please dont worry about injecting yourself.. It really does not hurt.. just remember to alternate injection site. Normally you inject into your tummy so just do alternate sides.  I was a bit wary about preparing the needle but once I had done it a couple of days it was fine.  Had no side effects apart from aching lower back.. As we are all paranoid about every ache and pain we get.. I did ask Oncologist and he said its \"where the bone marrow is being stimulated to produce white cells\"..  I never once had a low bllod count and am sure was down to these injections. Hope this helps. Regards Debra    ",

      "Content": "Hi All I was due to have a small implant fitted last friday, after undergoing mastectomy (2009), and reconstruction op (2011). Had a call from Consultant on Thursday saying that he thinks I would be better to have Fat Transfer Procedure as opposed to implant. Just wondered if anyone has had this done and how it went and how do they feel about the results.. Thanks Debra  ",

      "Content": "Hi Gillian, Thanks so much for your reply.. When I had the mastectomy I had no pain at all.. I also had the morphine pump  - like you pressed it to see what happened.. made me feel sick !!  so pleased did not need it !!! I will buy a sports bra, did you wear it in the hospital ??.. How long was it before you was allowed out of bed in the hospital ??.. I will have to have a reduction on the otherside  - I think about 6 months later..  Also if you drive how long was it till it was ok ??  sorry to fire all these questions at you !!! Thanks Debra",

      "Content": "Hi Gillian, Thanks again !!!  I was not sure whether they fitted you with a catheter.. I was like that with the mastectomy up about 10pm and in the chair the next morning.. My remaining breast is quite large, but I am happy to have a reduction that side.. Doc is going to do op with view not to have an implant but if he feels needs to will put one in. Will have to sort out my \"glitzy drain bag\" again !!!. You are exactly right regarding learning from other people.. Thats why this site is so good.. I could drive after 4 weeks with mastectomy but did expect it to be longer with this op. Thank you again  -  and I am sure I will have more questions !!! Regards Debra",

      "Content": "Hi Annabel, Just to reiterate what's been said before, this really is the worst time. Just waiting for results. I hope that you get the all clear but if you don't it may make you a bit more reassured to hear from someone who has come out the other side !! I was diagnosed in 2009, had mastectomy, chemo, radiotherapy. Then in 2011 I had Breast Reconstruction, which I am so pleased with results. Yes it was tough but the treatments are amazing and I now feel really well Good luck for results. Regards Debra",
