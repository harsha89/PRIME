    "Content": "I have just gone through chemo and radiotherapy and lost my hair during that time. It has now started to grow back. I don't have any children of my own, but have nieces who I'm very close to and who are also sensitive. I'm also a teacher. I wasn't sure how to talk to my nieces about cancer as I knew they would see some differences in me, so I thought it was better that they knew. I spoke to a friend who works for a charity that supports children and their parents who are dealing with cancer. She explained to me that in her experience, it is definitely better to talk to children about it all. Children are definitely more perceptive than we realise and notice things when we think they don't. My friend also said that children can get quite angry and feel left out if they're not told what's happening. She advised me to share with my nieces the book called 'The Secret C' by Julie A Stokes. It's a cartoon book that explains about cancer and its side effects. Some of it wasn't relevant so my sister read the parts to them that were. At the time, my nieces were 11 and 7 years old. The 7 yr old, like yours was going through an over-sensitive time but I've been open with them the whole way through. They've seen me gradually lose my hair. It was a slight shock to them when they saw me with less hair, having had long blonde hair all my life but it definitely seemed to help that it was gradual. I also tried to make jokes with them and they even tried on my wig which they thought was hilarious. Totally understand what you're saying but having just been through chemo, although it wasn't as bad as I'd expected, it would be very difficult to keep a secret from children. I wish you lots of luck and hope that whatever you decide to do, it all works out well for you.",
