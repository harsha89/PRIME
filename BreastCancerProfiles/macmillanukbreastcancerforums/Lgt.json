      "Content": "During my 4th Oncologist appointment on Friday for 4 of my 6 TAC session i mentioned that my breathing had become really tight on even short walks. I had an ECG yestrday that has shown a small leak in valve that goes back to lungs. Heart itself looks ok  I dont have another appointment until 20th July for oncologist to discuss although i have been told will need follow up. I have had no surgery as yet or no radiation therapy ( i am advised i will need approx 20 after surgery) as reduction is the first step of which im please to say has reduced over the 3 treatments i have had by 3.5cm. I am worried that this valve problem will effect my treatment. Anyone had anything like this.  I know the oncologist will be the best person to ask but seems a long way off till next clinic.",
