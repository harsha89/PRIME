      "Content": "this is so me! I was diagnosed July 2013, grade 3 aggressive but not spread. It feels like ever since diagnosis I ache and always fear it coming back. I live life totally and appreciate small things much more, but it doesn't take much to knock me back. I have a very sore elbow which doctor says is tennis elbow and sore shoulder blade and a new one is sore neck. It's not one thing on top of another it's one thing after another. Terrible disease which no one who hasn't had it can understand the mental anguish. I can't find any courses etc in my area (Kent) but I trudge on with the help of my very supportive husband. I too have met lots of lovely people. Try to look for the positives. It's hard, but they are there. xxxxÂ ",
