      "Content": "Jbelle Just wondering if anyone can help me with easing my anxiety attacks. Have had anxiety attacks since I was diagnosed but lately, it is on a daily basis. It is getting worse as I feel nausea, no appetite, chills, sad and crying for no reason. Have spoken to my doctors and they said that chemotherapy has made me menopausal and Tamoxifen has surpressed my hormones, therefore causing this. It is really so difficult to handle my anxieties and it's physical symptoms everyday. Doctor said that there's no cure and my body needs time to get used to its present condition. Is this really true? It is really horrible living like this. Really appreciate if anyone could advise. Many thanks  Hi Jbelle, I finished my breast cancer treatment back in may. I was put on letrozole. 2 months in I had started to get anxiety and I felt awful. Phoned  my breast cancer nurse and she said the letrozole does not cause this, and as I had suffered with this before it's was just coincidence. I read up on these pills and everyone of them can bring on anxiety because it is lowering our hormones. I stopped taking mine and I do feel better but now have to control the anxiety. My doctor gave me propanolo which is very good. I am also on antidepressants.  I now have got to go back and see my cancer doctor because I am hormone positive.  It is a horrible thing to have but you will get better. Sue x",
