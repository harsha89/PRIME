    "Content": "Violet, I have had a very bad back/shoulder spasm and I am about ten days post lumpectomy. I think it's due to me overcompensating a little on my left side whilst protecting my operation side.  I'm wondering with having the double mastectomy are you protecting a little too, and holding your posture differently. I get the lying on the floor in agony thing. I have radiation down into my arm too with numbness in my fingers. Of course all manner of panic has set in, with me thinking it's something sinister. But, I have spoken to GP and physio and they reckon it's due poor posture and I've been prescribed antispasmodics.  Try not to panic and hopefully things will start to settle over the next few days. That's what I'm hoping for myself. x",
