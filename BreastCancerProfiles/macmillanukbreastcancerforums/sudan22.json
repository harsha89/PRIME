      "Content": "Hi My mother 75 yrs is also on LAPATINIB drug 4 tab per day along with Primma. Her case cancer spread to plural effusion. I am also not aware of the possible outcome of the drug. Oncologist advised to do few tests chest X-ray and ultrasound and blood tests after taking above drug for a month. Based on the positive result she has plan to give LAPATINIB for 6 months As a side effect, could u please let me know how u manage to control nausea and vomiting, sleep disorder and loss of appetite if you have come across in case of your mother. Still will appreciate if someone can throw more light on the above drug. Thanks",
