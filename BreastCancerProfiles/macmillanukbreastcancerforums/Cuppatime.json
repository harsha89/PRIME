I did have a few hot flushes but they seem to have gone now - I've been on L for 5 months now.  I had arthritis before and don't think my aches and pains are any worse.  The only big SE I've had is a reduced appetite and taste which is something I never thought I would have!  I've lost 1 and half stone but the hospital didn't think that was too bad!  I'm happy as I had fought for a long time to loose some weight but don't want to loose too much more.  Christmas goodies helped a bit, and hopefully SEs will diminish.  The other one I developed was excessive saliva.  This again has improved thankfully.  My Onco doc hadn't heard of it being a SE of Letrozole! All good wishes for 2019 xx",

      "Content": "Hello All Does anyone else take Dr Reddy's brand?  I was given this by hospital pharmacy and decided to stick with it as the SE didn't seem to effect me too much, and didn't want to run the risk of changing to another brand that gave me worse SEs.   It proved difficult to track down a local pharmacy who could/would stock it for me, but eventually I did and they get it on 'special' order for me.  My GP also agreed to write on my repeat prescriptions that I was to have this brand.  I have been told a few times that it is very expensive.  If this is so, why is it handed out in the first place?    I did ask my oncologist but he didn't know!     A very happy new year, and lots of love to all xx",

So onwards and upwards.   Lots of love, and hugs to all",

Got there early but was kept waiting about 20 mins with no apology.  Then went in to find one of the radiographers was a young male.   Bit of a shock as I  was expecting the ladies I had seen on Friday!   Came out with only a few minutes left on my car park pass!     This all sounds very minor to your problems now I've written it down Taralou ,  and I do hope things improve for you. Take care J x",
