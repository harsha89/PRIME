      "Content": "Hey everyone. I was diagnosed a month ago with HER+ ER- Grade 1/2 BC.  I have completed round 1 of my chemo and I\u2019m now really struggling again with anxiety. Im finding myself comparing my story to others and reading and fearing the absolute worst. I\u2019m terrified that at 30.... this is it for me.  Where are the positive stories and do people really get through this successfully because at the moment I just can\u2019t see it :-( X",

      "Content": "Hi ladies - I feel I\u2019m a bit isolated in my diagnosis as I can\u2019t find many other people with ER Neg BC!  I\u2019m stage 2 - predominantly due to size (5cm) but no known spread to lymph nodes. I\u2019m undergoing pretty gruelling TCHP chemo before any surgery in a bid to reduce the size.  Is there anyone else out there who has some positive stories about this type of BC? I know everyone is different but I\u2019m 30 and so scared of spread/ recurrence and keep reading that ER- has more chance of coming back and spreading!!  Any support would be great!! X",

      "Content": "Thank you for the quick replies ladies! I really felt I was in the minority and all I kept reading (googling) was that ER neg was not good and doubled up with HER2 was even worse!!  I have since been told by my oncologist that they actually prefer to you to be her positive now that Herceptin is on the cards! So I felt a bit better about that!! Xx",
