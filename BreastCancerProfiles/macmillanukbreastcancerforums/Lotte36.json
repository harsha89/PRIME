      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new to the group but thought I'd share my experience with you. I am 3 weeks post mastectomy with reconstruction (implants). I was diagnosed with DCIS however due to the amount my only option was to have a mastectomy. I chose to have instant reconstruction. Honestly the whole experience has been much better than I thought. I stayed in hospital for 3 nights, was up and about the following day. I had to go home with a drain, which stayed in 2 weeks and the pain is manageable with paracetamol, which I never thought it would be. I am still swollen and see my consultant every week but so far very straight forward. This is obviously the summary version but if you want to know anything pls ask x",
