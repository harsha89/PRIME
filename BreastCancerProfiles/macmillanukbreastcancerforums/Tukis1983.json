Underarm area felt a little tender so I decided to have a feel and discovered a small lump. I'm absolutely sick with fear and panic and  thinking the worst. I don't understand how I cud have a lump if I had all my lymph nodes removed from that area. ",

I was in contact with my nurse this morning so just waiting for a call back. I didn't have reconstruction. I had a double mastectomy with auxiliary clearance. Thanks for taking the time to get back to me x",

I know what you mean about making time for your children I'm doing the same, less housework more play. Deep down I fear I won't be here to see them grow up and I just can't bare the thought. I'm 29 years old. I know that I have nodes involved but don't know how many yet. Are you finished with treatment ",

I feel so guilty putting them through this. I know that sounds silly but I do. I wish their little childhoods could be perfect and carefree. Everyone says it gets easier I just hope that is true. X",

Surgery took more out of me than I was expecting but it's upwards and onwards today again. It's a rollercoaster ride that none of us ladies want to be on. As you say jo it's gaining back that bit of perspective. Results tomorrow which I'm not looking forward to but il deal with that then too. Tomorrow is another day as they say.Hope everyone is keeping good. Thanks everyone I just needed a bit of a meltdown sometimes it's good to let it out xx",
