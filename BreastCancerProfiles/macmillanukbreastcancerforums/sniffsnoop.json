      "Content": "Hi Clair I didn't do the scalp cooling treatment as I read the literature and decided it wasn't for me. Basically I didn't want to spend the extra time at the hospital. Throughout my treatment I have met many ladies who have had varying stories of success. Not one of them has told me they regretted trying it, even those who still went on to lose their hair. If it's important to you, and that's what counts, then it's worth trying. Because I wasn't trying the scalp cooling I was actually fitted with my wig before I started chemo. An appointment was made for me to meet the 'wig lady' at my chemo unit but practices may vary. You get one 'free' wig on the , never ended up wearing mine as I never felt right in it but it was gorgeous and looked good.  I have met lots of people that have bought themselves several styles on line and said they're not too expensive.  Hope all goes well with the cooling, just keep the wig for back up, the chemo nurses can make an appt I'm sure Love Max xxx",

We don't allow ourselves to think about what is happening as we need all our strength to focus on treatment. However once treatment is over I think we finally allow ourselves to think about what has happened and it can be a difficult time. I had what I called a 'dark' period but fortunately it didn't last long and I'm sure yours won't either. Once the dust has settled on it all you will pick up and feel much better about it all. But be assured from the many people I have talked to this is quite a normal way to feel and no, it's not just you so don't beat yourself up about it. You don't have to be bursting with the joy of every new day, for one thing people would probably think you were mad! Just allow yourself time to deal with it all. Hugs Max xxx",

I am now halfway through 18 cycles of Herceptin and on Tamoxifen for 5 years.  It's ok to feel scared, everyone does mostly it's a fear of the unknown. We worry what it will be like to have it, how it will make us feel. I promise you it won't be half as bad as anything you're imagining. No-one gets all the side effects but we all get some. The best advice I can give you is to tell your team everything you suffer from as they can offer help with everything, if your pills don't work, tell them and they'll try some different ones. Please do not suffer in silence, it's hard enough without suffering anything you don't need to! On the plus side, I have now been back at work 4 months and it's like I've never been away. You will come out the other side of all this crap and life will be back to normal before you know it. Look after yourself,  wishing you strength and remember just because you have a little weep now and then it doesn't make you weak. Let it out and come back fighting. Love and hugs Max xxx",

The side effects are horrendous but you will get through it it just probably doesn't feel like that now!

Although I had been told it's not ideal my onc said it would be ok as the cannula would be in and out in a few hours. I think it's more if you should be hospitalised and on IV antibiotics that it's not possible to use the affected arm due to the high risk of infection from a cannula that's being left in situ. In a perfect world I think they prefer not to use it and would definitely never take blood pressure on that side. I for one was happy for them to use that arm on those two occasions due to damge to veins in other! Love Max xx",

Your situation is different with having a double mastectomy. Did you receive a chart from breast nurse with various exercises to do? I can't stress enough the importance of doing them. I had days where it seemed like too much effort or that it would make things worse, but honestly they really help. I think the fact that I'm right-handed helped too as I did things and moved it more automatically than had it been my left-hand. Well that's what I put my swift recovery down to! I can still 'feel' it when I lift my arm above a certain height but as this isn't an everyday occurrence, nor does it cause me any pain, I can live with it. I did have some 'cording' but because I was able to move my arm, over time I stopped feeling for it so can't be accurate as to when it went but 10 months on it's no longer there or if it is, its not obvious or detrimental.

I didn't use the cold cap because it didn't worry me to lose my hair, in your words mine was hardly 'my crowning glory' either, also I didn't want to spend the extra time at the unit on what was already a tiring day. Having said that I was offered the option, told it doesn't work for everyone but can be worth a try, given lots of information and left to make my own decision. On the positive side I had the opportunity to 'start over' with no hair colour damage etc, now it's growing back.  I fear like some of the others that the damage has already been done to your hair. Is it really worth the discomfort and time if it's already loose. As with everything it's your decision to make and ask if you really want to. I found it quite liberating having no hair, was not worried by anyone else's looks at my bald head, wore some wonderful scarves on occasion, nothing expensive, primark mostly, and got creative. The wig was never my 'thing' too hot and uncomfortable and never felt I looked like 'me'. Another plus is that after years of shoulder-length hair I have had so many people comment that I would suit short hair, that's the way I may stay. Would I have the courage to try that without this happening, who knows! It's a very personal choice - save your hair/shave it off, wig/hat/scarf, or bald but it's always great to hear what others think. Wishing you well with your treatment Love Max xxx",

Slightly concerned but not overly worried as there was no lump. Had mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy all in one day but nothing was found. Then the focus seemed to shift from my breast to the lymph nodes, all concerned kept saying they were swollen though, again, here I could feel nothing. What followed was around 5 weeks of going for biopsies, ultrasounds, etc on Mondays and back for results on Fridays. Not complaining was glad to get my results so quickly. Eventually in March I was diagnosed with breast cancer the lump was against my chest wall and I never would have felt it.  I don't tell you this to make you worry but to reassure you that you're doing all the right things and not ignoring things or going away when they tell you you're too young. I am much older than you at 45 but with your family history you should and are being alert. Once all this is done at least you will hopefully be reassured. If the worst comes to the worst and it is breast cancer then like me it will be caught early due to your vigilence and refusal to be fobbed off. Wishing you well and hoping it all turns out to be nothing but never give up if you feel something is wrong. You know your own body, they don't. Love Max xxx  ",

I returned to work in December last year, after 9 months off having treatment for Breast Cancer, to a job where confidence in what you're saying, a thick skin and determinaion are a must, so you can just imagine how the first few months panned out.... My confidence was at an all time low, feelings of panic when I felt out of my depth, emotional outbursts for no apparent reason! Fortunately, unlike some, my work have been fantastic - 'watching' me but in a good way, stepping in when they could see it was becoming too much, letting me take a breather if necessary and just generally listening to my emotional ramblings some days - that always felt good to let it all out, to say it out loud to somebody and be reassured that I wasn't going crazy. I have noticed that the last few months I have come on in leaps and bounds, feeling good, feeling confident, feeling more like the 'old' me but with a new perspective too. I am now able to concentrate on the things that really matter and let go of the things that just don't! I am no longer 'the woman who had cancer' am just Max. Not that anyone ever made me feel like that, with time and distance I can see it was ME that thought they were thinking that! I think after what you have been through your feelings are completely understandable but I promise you, you won't feel like this forever, it will get better. Just allow yourself the time and don't rush things. Wishing you well Love and hugs Max xxx",

I asked this question on here a while ago whilst swapping stories with too ladies and neither had experienced it. Mine tends to be as I wake in the morning too I actually cried one morning it was so sudden and painful lol. Mine is in my calves not experienced it in my back thankfully. I've been on Tamoxifen since Aug 2010 and it's very random how mine occur. Love Max xxx",
