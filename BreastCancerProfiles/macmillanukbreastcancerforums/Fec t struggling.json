    "Content": "Hi Ella 70,  Sorry to hear of your cancer & you are going through exactly what I did. I bit the bullet & told my friends on facebook & being honest they have followed ny journey giving me support every time I had something to say. I felt it gave me a reason/excuse not to answer questions face to face but they always asked how I was which I suppose I always said \"yea not too bad thanks\" easiest answer going. I felt it was the right thing to do for me at the time but everyone is different. I started writing a diary which also helped. Happy birthday & good luck with whatever your treatment is you can do this & always stay positive  Dawn xx",
