      "Content": "Hi Babs I finished my treatment for IDC grade 3 and one of 15 lymph nodes were affected . Had chemo and Radiotheraphy which finished in Sept last year. Was due to have reconstruction surgery after my masectomy , and other breast removed in April. Unfortunately I had to have two teeth removed and so my surgery has been put back until June I am \"gutted\" to say the least. It just seems to all be taking soooo long. I am still off work, and can't face going back until I have all my surgery. I am worried about my job, and about the op and am feeling very low at the moment too . Sorry to drone on, but just wanted you to know your not alone. Good Wishes Mashley",

      "Content": "Hi I am having reconstruction surgery in April. I have an expander at moment, so am having this taken out an implant put in, and a masectomey and immediate implant all at the same time . sorry that all sounds a bit \"Garbled\"!!! Anyway I saw my dentist today who on checking my teeth says I need a Root Canal filling on one of my back lower molars. When I spoke to my surgeon a few weeks ago she mentioned infection through Root Canal fillings. I don't know now wether to just have the tooth extracted. My dentist wants to do the the treatment before my surgery. Sorry to drone on !!! Thanks A Worrier",

This is just what my surgeon was referring to.. I asked her about anything affecting the implants,and she mentioned infection, even Root Canal treatment. I may try to speak to her sec tomorrow. Thanks for your reply",

      "Content": "Hi Kiera I have also had a mx nearly a year ago. I have had chemo and finished rads end September. My surgeon is doing my surgery in April, which will be removal of my expander and insertion of implant, and removal of right breast with immediate reconstruction . I will be having implants, as only a three hour op compared to ten hours for a Diep. I just don't have a problem with having implants, and a shorter op and shorter recovery time. Sorry to ramble, but this is just my opinion . Love n Light Mashley",
