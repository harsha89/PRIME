      "Content": "Hi everyone Little wombat I understand where you're coming from about your daughter. I have, for a long time, had a semi strained relationship with my eldest daughter.   In the kitchen the other day she banged her head on a cupboard door, I automatically went to give her a cuddle, immediately I get \"Mum, you know I don't like being touched\". I was having a 'scared it might come back day' and promptly burst into tears. Then everything is such a drama with me, er excuse me?! I only finished my treatment 6 weeks ago, I think I'm entitled to feel a little raw now and again. I explained that I was feeling a bit scared and the response was \"you don't have cancer now\".  Basically, it's over now, get on with it. We ended up having a huge row about her insensitivity and lack of understanding, apparently it's all a bit much for her. I have tried so hard not to bother anyone with how I feel now that my treatment has finished, and even through my treatment you do your best to shield your family as best you can. Sorry, rambling, based on experiences with my daughter, I've found the best way is to just let her get on with it. I find if I keep saying I'm sorry for whatever it is I'm supposed to have done, it seems to her that she is fully justified in her actions. Don't apologise for keeping it from her, you had your reasons, (obviously you wanted to protect her until you knew what was what). I'm just completely normal with her, I get the cold shoulder for a couple of days and then she starts speaking again. I don't bring up what happened.   Apparently she's still waiting for an apology from when I asked her to get some lemons for me and she asked for the £1.80, I told her I thought she had a nerve as she lives here rent free and any money she gets is her own. According to her I was rubbing her nose in the fact that she doesn't have much money. I told her she will be waiting a long time for that apology, i.e. never. By the way she is 25, gets £500 a month, is using it to pay debts off, which is why we are not charging her board as I hope the sooner she gets it paid off, the sooner she will be able to have her own place again. Not sure this will be at all helpful, just wanted you to know that I understand where you're coming from.",

I've just started my second week of rads and would feel much happier knowing that I am using something that has been so effective for other ladies. Hopefully I haven't left it too late for it to make a difference. Anyway fingers crossed for a sympathetic doctor calling me back. It's just the constant worry of 'what if' regarding my skin and makes me feel quite anxious sometimes, even though the treatment itself is pretty easy and I am very lucky to only have a 10 minute drive to the hospital.

Also found out that I've got an ear infection so a prescription for that as well.  My local pharmacy said I can pick the creams up on Thursday, really pleased.

Obviously as time went on and I learnt to live with what was happening and started my treatment plan, I calmed down and was able to be more rational about things. I have made changes to my diet, cut down on diary, red meat, sugary things and increased fruit, veg, fish, but that was mainly because I have been recently diagnosed with familial high cholesterol, which I am starting treatment for at the end of November (oh goody!). I assume I will be put on statins which opens up another cans of worms as I know there is evidence that they are not that good for you, but there is also evidence that they can prevent recurrence of BC. Decision for another day. I even bought Professor Plant's book, which I found interesting, but I don't know, I guess it was too strict for me. I just don't want to go through life not having things I enjoy just in case my cancer comes back.  I agree with Julia's nan, a little bit of what you fancy...",

I've had it about 6 weeks. Spoke to my GP who didn't think it was anything, but told me to keep my eye on it. It hasn't changed at all. I thought it was a spot or bite to start with, but after various bombardments with creams etc, it's still there.  I personally know that it's not anything as I had a ct scan 2 weeks ago on chest, abdomen etc, so if it was something it would have been picked up. Sorry I'm waffling, should be asleep. Anyway what I'm trying to say is, it doesn't matter what I say, it doesn't matter what anybody on here says. You have to see somone whose decision you trust and find out one way or the other. You are making yourself ill, you need to get it sorted. Waiting for results is crap, but at least you will know. There is no point second guessing. Insist on seeing who you want and insist on getting tests/biopsy/whatever carried out on it. We all feel for you hon and we are all here for you. Next time I shall be wanting to hear about definitive results. Come on, you can do it, we are all behind you. Feel the fear and do it anyway. I shall be telling myself that as my chemo starts on the 30th and I'm scared sh*tless. Lots of love to you",

I was bawling my eyes out and continued to do so for quite a while, imagining all sorts of horrid scenarios for myself.  I can relate to how you feel about your hair, I was exactly the same, I think most of us are, all I can say that for me the thinking about it going was much more stressful than when it actually went.  To be honest my scalp was so unbearably painful I was glad to get it shaved off. No, it's not nice, but like everything else it's doable. I finished my chemo in June and now have a full covering of hair, albeit short. I saw a lady at the hospital yesterday, wearing a turban and she just thought that I just had short hair and was very excited to learn that it was only 3 months growth. I could see her thinking hmm that could be me 3 months after I finish.  We all think we're never going to get there but we do, good days, bad days and in between days. I think we need the sobbing days, horrible though they are, to release some of the stress and fears that we feel. It's just another way of coping and processing what is happening to us and never feel that you are less than strong because you feel like this. Hope you get your heating fixed quickly",

I was really worried about it being painful, but the lady was lovely, she said not to suffer and to let her know. The right one was okay, just a few seconds of gritted teeth. The left was more painful, but when I said that was as far as I could go on the pain front, she said that it would be fine and left it there. So all in all not too bad, now just the wait! Also had my first eye test since chemo (finished last June) and my eyes haven't changed at all, which means no change in 3 years and I didn't have to pay! So pretty pleased with that as well. Sending lots of love to everyone. Edit: My lovely BCN has just rung me to say my results are back and it's all clear, she didn't want me to have to wait and be worrying. What a star! Not a bad couple of days",

I hope you are feeling a little better this morning and that it was just the night time getting to you. Off to chemo myself now, which I absolutely dread. ",
