      "Content": "Hello Kelly, when we are told we have breast cancer the whole world stops and all you can hear is the word CANCER.  Its hard for us to make any sort of decision at one of the worst times of our lives.  I was bombarded with loads of forms, tests and doctors and nurses telling me what was going to happen, sign this form, sign that. I couldnt take it all in, information overload.  You have to try and stand back and decide yourself what you want and then not feel guilty about any of it, its the only time we can be selfish, we need to get better for our families and ourselves.  If you had decided to go for the trial you would have caused more stress for yourself and thats not needed.  I only did the trial because ive got three girls and they mentioned that they would check to make sure that they would see if there was a chance of them getting cancer, thats the only reason, selfish on my part some would say Please try and not worry too much about how big your lump is, im only talking through experience, i also had a 3cm grade 3 lump, and after the first chemo they were so shocked to see it had started to shrink, and after the third chemo its basically gone, they can just see the tag they inserted and the smallest amount of tumour, im onto my fourth chemo of six.  So good luck to you, its scary times but there is some good news out there, sending hugs to you xxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kittycat, Dont be worried about any of the tests you are facing.  Im at the same stage as you, and like yourself terrified.  Ive had my bone scan, and it was plain sailing, injection of radiation is only a little bit and i wasnt told to stay away from any of my children.  The machine doesnt cover your whole body, you have lights and nurses all around you, they even had the radio on when i had mine, so i just laid back and tried to stay awake lol.  Picc line inserted today, and i was a complete baby, imagining all sorts of pain, and i can honestly say please dont worry, the thought of it is worse than the actual thing.  I had a local which i didnt even feel.  Im not saying this just to help put your mind at rest, its actually the truth.  We build these tests up to be something to be so scared of and they arent.  OF course i wouldnt have any of them through choice but you and me dont have a choice, so try and relax and you will wonder why you worried so much beforehand.  My chemo starts monday so again im a bit nervous, just wonder what my side effects are going to be, if any!!  Positive attitude everyone says, well i think im positive i cant quite tell lol.  Think i will have a few glasses of wine like others on here. Good luck to you, sending you big hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "I was told on Thursday that i have got breast cancer, im shocked, upset, very scared as im sure you all were and still are.  My doctors havent told me much yet, if anything to be honest.  I was in total shock when i was told and all i could hear was the word cancer, every word after that i couldnt hear.  All i know is that the lump is 3cm, ive got to start chemo first.  How long i have had it, i dont know as ive had breast pain for quite a while also pain in my back the same side that the cancer is, has it spread?  So many questions are buzzing around in my head but im afraid to know the answers.  How will i cope?  My mum died of womb cancer 3 years ago and i will never get over that.  She was so brave, never cried and always positive.  Wish i could take after her but at the moment i feel like a 4 year old, im hurting and scared and want my mum.  Im actually 48 years old lol.  I have 3 girls and having to tell them broke my heart so i have no choice but to be brave and put on a face to show my girls that everything is going to be ok, but inside me i breaking up.  Im not scared for myself its my children. They are not ready to be left on their own.  im hoping to make a few friends on here that will be willing to listen to me moaning and telling them how scared i am as i cant let my family and friends know how i feel, it wouldnt be fair to worry them anymore than they already are.  So heres to new friends and a fight ahead of me. xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi ya Janice, so glad you are recovering well and im sure you are a very brave woman.  You are right tho, there is nothing i can do to get off this ride until its over i realise that.  Im off to the hospital on tuesday 10th April to find out a bit more.  All i know at the moment is that i have a lump which is 3cm and that ive got to have chemo first.  Hoping its to shrink the lump and not because they already know its spreading, my mind is playing bad tricks on me at the moment , i dont know that im accepting this, i think its more that i still dont believe it.  Im sure it will sink in very quickly once i start treatment.  Im hoping your kids were a support to you as you are on your own.  Im lucky that i wont have that problem, ive got a good husband and great kids. You take care, and its lovely to think there are people like yourself ready to listen to me xxxxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi ya Irene, im so sorry to hear that you are on your own.  You are right, it doesnt sink in to begin with does it?  Ive just been to the hospital today to find out what my plan is, ive got a grade 3 cancer, quite big apparently so ive got to have an operation next week like you to have lymph nodes removed.  Then chemo 6 sessions, then operation to remove lump then radiothephy.  What a mess this all is isnt it.  Im so lucky to have my family around me so will not be going through this on my own.  I dont know much about all this at the moment but i do know that the cancer nurses are so helpful and you can phone them anytime.  Tell them how you are feeling, they may be able to help you.  Ive only been on this site a few weeks but already have found some wonderful people willing to listen to me.  Dont worry too much about the housework, that is always neverending!!!  Tell your family how you feel, as you say they are supportive so maybe they can help you around the house.  Sending you a hug xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Trisha, isnt it a shock when youre told you got cancer.  It happens to other people but not us.  Im just getting my head around it now.  I went for all my tests and information day on thursday.  Was bombarded with so much information i couldnt think straight. But everyone i met was so nice and kind.  Ive got to have a tag inserted onto my tumour in the hope that when i start chemo it may get so small they cant find it when they operate after my chemo.  Then got an operation to remove some lymph nodes removed on 8th May then chemo starts 10 days after that.  What a road we have got to travel down, but already ive found some lovely people on here and feel i can have a moan and they know how i feel, instead of moaning to my family as i dont want to burden them too much as they are so upset and i feel if i moan at them they will worry more.  Feel free to have a moan or chat to me any time.  sending you a hug xxxxxxxxxxxx",
