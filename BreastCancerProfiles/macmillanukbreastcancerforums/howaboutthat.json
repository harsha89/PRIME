      "Content": "Hi LH60 I cannot help regarding the lumpectomy as I was only offered a mastectomy. Original diagnosed with DCIS high grade and spread over a large area. They said a lumpectomy would make my breast very out of shape. I went ahead with the mastectomy back in January 2019 and at the same time had a skin-sparing mastectomy with implant reconstruction with the view to have a full reconstruction at a later date using fat from my stomach. Once the breast was removed it was tested and a  stage 2 cancer was found but nothing in lymph nodes and was HER negative so lucky for me I did not have to have any chemo or radiotherapy. I was very nervous about having to have such a operation but the pain after was short lived and I think it was a small price to pay for getting rid of the cancer. Had I not had the breast removed then my situation could have been so much different now.  Its is hard  when you are given options to which direction to go. But you most never be hard on yourself for whichever direction you take. Its all doable and before you know it it will be all behind you and you can live life to the full.  I do have to decide now if I want my implant removed and have a full reconstruction  but for now I am happy with what I have got. With cloths on no one can tell. Without cloths on is a different matter but then its got to know that the cancer has gone.  regards El ",

Mine was with a nurse (not a breast nurse) they ask lots of questions about your health, take your blood pressure etc.Think they take bloods and also test for MRSA. They also give you some info for the day of the op.  Good luck with your operation. What are you having done and when is it due to be done? El",

As I feel very lucky with how my treatment and results have gone so far.  I am seeing my consultant on Tuesday to speak about the next steps. I don't have to decide there and then.   Its good to find out from other women what their experiences are.  El",

      "Content": "Hi Amalie Thanks for your reply. The recovery time is not really any different to my silicone implant so it seems as if this is standard. Its a shame I couldn't have had the DIEP done in the first place as I would not now be in this dilemma.  I must admit I feel a bit of fraud when there are lots on here having to have lots of different treatment and  all I seem to have to worry about is should I or shouldn't I have a full reconstruction. Does your breast feel natural and do you get any pain around it?  regards El",

      "Content": "Hi   Thanks for replying to me. I would have gone for the immediate DIEP but i would have had to wait a lot longer to have the breast removed. It all comes as a shock and I just wanted the breast removed asap. I was diagnosed with DCIS so I knew that I would loss my nipple. When the breast was removed and tested it revealed a stage 2 15mm cancerous cell, so this was the right decision for me. If I had waited longer who knows what size the cancer would have been.  I am really pleased with the look and outcome of my implant but just don't like the fact it is a foreign body inside your body and will need to be removed several years down the line.  Still need to do lots of thinking.  Hope your recovery continues to go well. Have you got to have any chemo?  El",

      "Content": "Hi All I had a right side mastectomy back in January 2019. Had stage 2 breast cancer but nothing in lymph nodes and was HER negative so lucky for me I did not have to have any chemo or radiotherapy. I had a skin-sparing mastectomy with implant reconstruction with the view to have a full reconstruction at a later date using fat from my stomach.  Has anyone else had this done and if so have you gone on to have the full reconstruction? I am in two minds as what to do. The implant breast looks good, my surgeon has done an amazing job and with cloths on no one can tell that I have anything done due to having my own skin. But and here is the but its very hard to touch, heavy and you know its there and its a foreign body which will need replacing some time in the future.  I would be gratefully for any advise from people that have had a full reconstruction using fat from elsewhere. How was the operation, recovery etc regards El ",
