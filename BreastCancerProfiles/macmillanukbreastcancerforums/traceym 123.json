      "Content": "I'm 29 and waiting for my referral to clinic after finding a lump.  I haven't told anyone yet; I know the stats are quite firmly on my side and the chances of it being something scary are tiny, so I initially thought that it would be best not to worry anyone unless it turned out to be something to worry about.  Now I'm finding it really hard - if I'd been asked a month ago if a 2 week target for referrals sounded quick I would have said yes, but it's been just 4 days since I saw my GP and the wait is doing my head in.  I'm getting more anxious with every passing hour - however much I tell myself it's going to turn out to be nothing, I keep fixating on the fact that it could be.  I feel guilty for being so preoccupied when I don't even know the diagnosis yet.  I just don't know what to do with myself, and would appreciate any advice from others who have gone through the same.",

      "Content": "Thanks Colin and Kate. It's great to be able to come here and know there are others who've had the same experiences, worries and everything else. It makes me feel less neurotic and nuts. I've spent most of today online looking at various sites, reading about the experiences of others etc. I can't seem to stop and I already know google is no friend in a situation like this, but I'm struggling to think about anything else. Just want to be able to snap out of this and get a grip. Yesterday I decided I would tell my other half today, but I bottled it. He know's something is up, asked what was on my mind, but I shrugged it off. Really don't like keeping him in the dark but I just didn't know how to start the conversation. really wanted to wait until I had the appointment through, just seemed less harsh if instead of saying \"there's maybe a problem\", I could say \"there's maybe a problem, BUT on X date I can go find out for sure\"... Don't know what to do. Colin I have my fingers crossed that you get the good news you're hoping for, and that you get the chance to enjoy an incident free Xmas sometime soon x",

      "Content": "Thanks Rachel. I'm glad I found this site as everyone has been so welcoming and understanding, it has really helped. Still waiting for the appointment to come through, I never would have guessed 7 days could drag like this! Fingers crossed it won't be too much longer. It's the not knowing that drags you down. My mind keeps turning traitor and imagining the worst. I know I'm still well within the two week guideline but at what point do I start harassing my gp to check I wasn't forgotten about..?! This was the first time I'd been to see her since registering and I don't want to start off as a nightmare patient :/",

      "Content": "Well it turns out the hospital sent a letter to my old address initially, so the day they called with a new appointment was 2 days after i had been due to be seen (which would have been 6 days after GP appointment).  Minor annoyance but I've updated everything now.  It looks like everything is ok, I had ultrasound/FNA of  the lump and they think it is a cluster of cysts.  Need to wait for results before I know anything for certain but the doctors seemed confident it wasn't anything to worry about, so big relief :)  turns out i also have another cyst on the other side, and they're 100% sure about that one.  it feels like such a load off, the past 2 weeks have been a bit of a stress-fest.  I just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who took time to offer words of advice, it really means so much to me.  i am very humbled by everyone i've encountered here - even with so much to cope with you have all been so welcoming and full of great advice.  I just want to wish all you all the very best xxx",
