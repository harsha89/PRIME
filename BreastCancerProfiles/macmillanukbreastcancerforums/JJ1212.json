      "Content": "Hi jjtoo, I have been lurking on the site for sometime too but your post is the first that I have responded too. I understand your feelings at the missed opportunity for an earlier diagnosis. After a routine medical in 2013 I was referred for an ultrasound on a small lump that the doctor could feel but did not show up on the mammogram. The ultrasound showed a cyst and I went away totally reassured by the ultrasound technician. Eight months later in March 2014 the cyst doubled in size overnight and a referral to the breast clinic revealed a 3cm grade 2, ER+8, mucinous tumour which had been developing behind the cyst. I had a WLE and 16 nodes removed (all clear) and, after getting a low score on the Oncotype DX test, 15 sessions of radiotherapy and Tamoxifen for 10 years . My surgeon explained that the cyst had masked DCIS and had I been seen at their clinic it would have been aspirated and perhaps the cancer could have been caught at stage 1? The cyst had suddenly grown because of a bleed after my 9 year old fell over and landed hard on my chest.  I found it really difficult to stop thinking \"if only\" and kicking myself for having been too easily reassured, not having gone back sooner and also \"what if\" the bleed hadn't happened and I had remained in ignorance until it had spread. None of the energy I spent on that thinking helped me of course but I found it very hard to stop the loop.",

      "Content": "Hi Jan, I was 52 and perimenopausal, the ultrasound technician suggested that changes in my hormone levels could have caused the cyst to form. The type of cancer that I had is more common in women of 70+ and even the consultant at the breast clinic was unsure what he was looking at so I have accepted that it wasn't that easy to diagnose (well almost). I am doing very well now thank you. As I didn't have chemo my treatment was over quite quickly and while I do have some aches and pains the side effects of the Tamoxifen are manageable now that I am sticking to the same brand. I hope that your treatment plan is sorted soon and that all goes well. Best wishes, Jane     ",
