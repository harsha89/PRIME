    "Content": "HI, I was diagnosed end of June with a grade 3 lump in my right breast, which I found myself being only 34, no screening. I have had a lumpectomy and node clearence, 4 were involved. Also I have had to have a termination as I was in the early stages of pregnancy as my oncologist told me he couldn't treat me the best he could if I was pregnant, couldn't even send me for a scan to see if the cancer had spread. Heartbreaking after my partner and I have been trying for a year.  Since then I have been told my cancer is ER pos and 8/8 Her2 neg, which in cancer terms is supposed to be good, but in baby terms not so good.  I cant even harvest any eggs as that will pump my body full of hormones which my cancer thrives off! Anyway, I have just had my 1st lot of chemo last week, and i was petrified, but after the sickness stopped 2 days later and I started eating again I don not feel too bad, except from a sore arm where my picc line is. I have cried and cried as you can imagine, but even though my story is pretty horrific and upsetting I have still heard worse. Your not alone in this journey, and you will gain a great strength in finding a mentor who has been through it and come out the other side. I felt so alone at the beginning thinking this is an old womans disease, but now i know its  not just me, breast cancer can affect anyone at any age, and us younger women have to stick together and make people more aware. You will get through it hun, be strong, cry of even have a large glass of wine, its you time now and you do what you feel you want to do to get through it. Lucy   xxxxx",
