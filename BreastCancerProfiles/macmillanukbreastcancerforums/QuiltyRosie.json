      "Content": "Hi, I am 53 and was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in November 2013, had a lumpectomy with lymph nodes removed, followed by radiotherapy. I started on Tamoxifen in January 2014 (so 21 months). Six weeks ago I had severe pelvic pain so my GP sent me for a TVU which showed a thickening of my endometrium to 12mm. Not vastly thick (how thick is too thick?!) but enough for me to get a two-week referral for a hysteroscopy and biopsy. The first attempt at a hysteroscopy was a fail - they couldn't get into my uterus at all because of a stenotic cervix, so I had to have it done under general anaesthetic two days ago. The surgeon seemed to think that the changes were caused by the Tamoxifen and I am anxiously waiting for the biopsy results. My question is this: even if, God willing, the results are clear, will the Tamoxifen continue to affect my endometrium? Has anyone out there had similar problems, and what treatment have you had? I don't think I can go through the worry and the whole hysteroscopy thing again. Is a hysterectomy an alternative? Please help! ",

      "Content": "Hi G n' J, Thanks for this. I will post the same question to the womb group. The trouble is at no point in all this did I actually see a gynaecologist to discuss any of this; all the surgeon said just before the procedure was that he thought the thickening was tamoxifen induced, and that I would have to wait up to six weeks for the biopsy results. In spite of the two-week referral by my GP it took six weeks for them to actually do the biopsy, and I have not been offered any other appointments or treatment. The hospital discharge letter said that my primary care follow up would be done by my GP. I am very upset that there seems to be no joined-up thinking by the doctors and I'm not entirely sure what to do next. ",
