    "Content": "Here in NZ I have heard of clients being turned away from massage appointments so I asked my oncologist if it was ok to have a massage or not. He told me that there was nothing that a massage therapist could do to make my lymphoma worse or better for that matter and that I should go have a massage if I felt like it. He said there was no reason not to have a relaxing massage and I have NHL! Meg NZ",
