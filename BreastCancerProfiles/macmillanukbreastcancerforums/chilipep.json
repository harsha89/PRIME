      "Content": "Hi Georgie, I can't imagine what you're going through. It must be surreal to think you're undergoing one procedure only to be told it may be a far harsher one. I have fingers, toes, everything crossed for you and a positive outcome. If you do have to have the mastectomy, my experience is that I had a double mastectomy at the start of December. Nearly 7 weeks on, I'm almost back to normal and it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.  The things I found difficult in the first week were getting in and out of the car when I was being taken home after the Op/back to the hospital for appointments. I needed someone else to fasten my seatbelt, open and close the car door. Lying down was really difficult, as was getting up afterwards. If you can get your hands on a V shaped pillow it will make all the difference.  I was fine to cook for myself, do the dishes, do the washing etc etc. I couldn't reach very high and I couldn't carry anything heavy (great excuse for getting someone else to put the bins out!!) Other than that, I felt a bit delicate but OK.  Immediately afterwards, it feels as though you can't use your arms because each time you do it strains your chest muscles. This passes really quickly though, you'll be amazed at your body's ability to heal itself.  Wishing you all the best. ",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here so sorry if I've posted in the wrong area. I had a double mastectomy about 6 weeks ago and have expanders. I've been for my first 'pumping up' session and although I can see a breast shape start to take place, there is a huge indentation across the middle of each breast shape.  I was wondering if anyone else could advise how long it will look like this? I'm feeling too sore to use any padding/wear a bra and so everything I wear looks slightly odd. I'm returning to work next week and only my boss knows why I've been off. I'm worried that I'm going to be really self conscious about this.  I've been told that total expansion (before permanent implants are fitted) will take around 6 months. Am I going to look this way until then? It's OK if I am, I just want to know that so I can deal with it and nobody seems able to give me an answer. Any advice welcome :-)      ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply Helen :-) In answer to your question, 36D so pretty much the same as you. I don't know what Becker expanders are - I may have those? Not sure. All I know is these are temporary, implants will be fitted later.  My current shape is quite hard to deal with. There is a huge indentation on both sides. I've had one fill up so far. I feel like such a fecking wuss for even moaning about it. But it is really troubling me.  x    ",
