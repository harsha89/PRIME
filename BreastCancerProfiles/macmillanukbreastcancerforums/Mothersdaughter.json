      "Content": "Hi there, I am new to the group, I had lumpectomy, lymph node removal and reduction of left breast just over a week ago. The scars are all healing well, so much so I no longer have to wear dressings on two of them. I wanted to ask if you can use bio-oil on the scars to stop them from drying out and help them heal better, won't see Dr. until Monday and wondered if anyone else had used bio-oil? Many Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi there,  Is there anyone that has had Docetaxel for breast cancer? Had my fourth chemo session three days ago now and it was my first Docetaxel, as my chemo drugs have been changed. The oncology nurse told me to expect aches & pains, which I am getting now, starting with my legs, feet and back. Temperature is normal, so def not infection. Taste has also gone, not enjoying any food or drinks and can't sleep. Any hints, tips? Will the pains/aches get worse? Not sure what to expect?  Thanks for reading xx",

So hard to keep your strength up when you just don't even want to eat or drink. Keeping regular checks on temperature, which luckily seems to be ok at the min. Hope I can figure out a way to get on with this xx",

Can't live off them. Water is vile, as is any juice additive I have tried. Just going to have to get on with it I think xx",
