      "Content": "Hi. I am about to start chemotherapy in a couple of weeks' time for triple negative breast cancer. I will be on my own with my only young teen daughter. Has anyone does this? I have no family here other than my daughter and husband and he works away. Can't really ask him to stop work for 18 whole weeks, but getting worried about coping. Has anyone else done this? Any advice would be much appreciated. ",

I think this is what everyone is saying in general: that it's tough, but could be managed if no serious side effects.  I do have a few friends who can help. Of course nearly all of them work full-time and have families, but I know they will do what they can to help.  My husband is now staying home for the first one and am hoping it won't be too bad so I can cope with the rest. Hope you are recovering well now and all the very best. Love and hugs. xxx",

One friend in particular has been texting me nearly every day and although she works pops round when she can to see how am coping emotionally.  I think the unknown frightens me, but I feel reassured that you other people are doing this on their own so it's doable.  Thank you for your reply and all the very best with the rest of your treatments. xxxx",

I wouldn't mind feeling 'high' at the moment: I remember when I had gas and air while giving birth and feeling 'brilliant!' :)    Luckily, friends have offered to drive me backwards and forwards and I am learning to say yes now, rather than pretending I can do it all! Hope your treatment is going ok and all the very best to you too.  Lots of love and hugs. xx",

I've always had some sort of sickness thing in my life: v bad morning sickness, vertigo, sickness after anaesthetic, car sickness. I have mentioned this at the oncologist appointment and she said she will bear it in mind when they give me the treatment. Fingers crossed she will ask them to put something in early one. It's a shame really that it's 2018 and we still have to have the same poison for treatment that the used to give more than 25 years ago! On the other hand, maybe we are lucky that there is something they can give us. Am trying to stay positive, although it is hard sometimes. Thank you for your reply and advice. All the best to you too. Lots of love and hugs. xx",

Amazing! you are the second person to say that they coped well.  I guess the reaction is def very individual.  I am trying  to take a walk every day and am eating sensibly for the first time in 20 years! So fingers crossed. It's wonderful that the treatment did not stop you from having a semi-normal life.  All the best to you too. Lots of love and hugs. xx",

I now have a date, 29th of June, so am cooking and freezing etc. After reading everyone's replies (than you everyone!!!), my husband has decided to definitely be home for the first one.  We had a long discussion about \"your money or your life\" and we are going to see how the first one goes. He can't be home for all of them, but I am relived that at least someone will be home for the first one. xx",

Thank you for your reply.  I've had a few friends offer to drive me to the hospital, so that is a relief.  I do worry about how my daughter will cope, but she is sensible and unless I am very poorly, she will be alright hopefully.  I am doing everything possible now to get ready, from cooking and freezing to even buying sick bags so my daughter doesn't have to deal with that if I can't. Fingers crossed that the side effects will be too bad. Thank you for your advice and all the very best to you. Love and hugs. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Needaname.  I am new to all this and didn't know how to reply to your earlier post about being on your own. That must be really hard! Have you got a friend or a family member who can help? My best friend lost her battle with ovarian cancer two years ago. She literally separated from her husband and a week later was diagnosed. But, myself and a few other friends helped her and I hope she felt that she was not along. We took turns to help with appointments or helping round the house. Do you have someone nearly who can help?Have you got a treatment plan yet?   I get my biopsy results on Thursday and all I think about is how my daughter is going to take it. We are a very small family with only me, my husband and our daughter.  I am shell-shocked to be honest. Friends say to stay positive and hope for the best and I don't know why I can't. She is so happy and blossoming and now this car crash into her whole existence.  I haven't told her anything yet. Waiting to get all the details so I can answer her questions.  Have you told your children yet? All the best.",

I had my daughter at age 40 and she is only 13 now and I am devastated for her sake.  We are very close and her world is about to come crashing down. Is there anyone out there who is in a similar situation or knows someone in a similar situation. This is my first posting, so thank you in advance.",
