      "Content": "Hi all,  Well I finally thought having been through chemo with a couple of extra rounds thrown in for luck as FEC didn't work but docetaxel did ( they were tough, no denying it), I would be on way to the next stage.  Surgery all scheduled and then bam!  Had my dose of Herceptin on the Tuesday and by Thursday my arm was sore to touch. Started to get bright red and felt like it was on fire.  Got worse and worse, by Sunday  Temp 38.4.  Into hosp and been here since . Bummer.  Eventually they removed my picc line and I'm on enough antibiotics to sink a battleship.  The real disappointment though is that my surgery has been cancelled and I won't be able to have my next Herceptin    on time.  The thing I've been worrying about is that after suffering all that chemo I'm now effectively not having anything and I'm worried that the tumour will think  \" fantastic I can grow again\"! I know it's illogical but I can't help it.  I'm sure my surgery will be rescheduled soon and they will get another picc line in somehow for me to have my Herceptin ( I can't have it subcut) but they won't consider it until all the infection gone.  Anyone experienced similar? ",

It looks ridiculous!  The only time I have ever had a curl on my head was about 1992, when I paid for a very expensive perm, hated it and had my hair cut short!  Got no idea what to do with the birds nest that is now perched on my bonce purporting to be my hair!  Will it ever return to normal?  ( I know the colour won't but apparently grey is trendy!) I'm hoping the curls will drop out and everything will even up as it grows. Fingers crossed.",

      "Content": "Hi all,  I had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal on 4th May and I still have a bright green large \"splodge\" on my boob near the scar. It's quite large and doesn't appear to be fading. I'm assuming it's the dye used during the procedure. I have washed and washed it but it's just not going! Can anybody tell me if this will eventually dissapear or on top of everything else  am I stuck with a green boob!  Thanks. ",
