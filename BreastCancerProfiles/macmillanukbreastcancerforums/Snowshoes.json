      "Content": "Hi I'm about to have my last lot of chemo on Thurs and was told that the last two would be the worst.  Like you I seem to have sailed through the frist 4 with very little side effects except the the normal hair loss and tiredness for first few days. My fifth one knocked me sideways took 7 days to get over it, just general feeling of no energy to do anything, bloated the whole time, constipation (even though taking Movicol).  Tightness in my left arm where lymph nodes removed, convinced myself I was starting to suffer with lymphodema (spelling??). I count myself lucky that like you my symptoms have been very mild, but I too am fed up with it now and although  I am please my last chemo is on Thursday I am also dreading the way I'm going to be feeling after it.  I realise it is only for the week and as you say others have had it a whole lost worse, but sometimes the only word for it is URGH. Hope you're feeling better soon.  xx",
