We need to \"spread the word\" so that those in high places take their responsibilities seriously and stop playing with lives. Take care, and a peaceful New Year to you and those you love and cherish. Christopher.  :-)",

      "Content": "Hello sweeta 1,                              I lost my Partner of 25 years to metastatic Breast cancer in early August;  she was 74 years old, and had her last reminder for Mammogram scan in 2009.  Result : no sign of cancer. She did not have another \"reminder\" letter after that, as Jenny was then over 70 years old - a 4cm lump was found (a chance visit to the GP for an unrelated matter) in 2013.  I believe had she had a Mammogram done in 2012 (three years after the 2009 scan), Jenny might have been saved.  Ladies are expected to remember, three years later, to ask for Screening when you reach 70.  Not good enough. We need to get the Message out there about the absolute importance of regular Screening - in the USA, yearly checks are recommended.  This has to be the way forward - people are being missed and are dying as a result of this irresponsible attitude by those who should know better - and not put cost before lives. I am male, but have a passion for this because of the above.  Please, if you care about lives of dear ones, pass on the Message - i have started a Petition through Change.org (Breast cancer Screening) and the more who sign, the more chance of reaching government and implementing change. I'm not on Facebook - note you are, perhaps a good way to spread the word... Thank you for reading this,                                                  In sympathy with all who suffer / are suffering as a result of this frightful disease (and current policy which must be changed).                                              Christopher.      ",

      "Content": "Hello to all of you on this Site,                                           I have written a Post re. the importance of sending out Reminder letters for Mammogram appointments - let's make 2016 the year in which Breast Screening Reminders are sent out to all females, regardless of whether you are 47 or 70 years old - should be sent whether females are 15 or 90 years old. Please pass on the Message and we can all help to potentially save lives ! Thank you for your time and kind regards for the new Year to all of you. Christopher (Chris.). ",
