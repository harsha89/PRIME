      "Content": "Thanks G n' J, my sanity has its ups and downs but managing to stay positive on the whole so far. I've got the Macmillan book and have read all of it, it was really useful and also had a recon talk with my breastcare nurse yesterday who has been brilliant and gave me a lot more info as well as showing me some photos of implant reconstruction done by my consultant which didnt look as bad I'd expected after seeing the images in the book. They said it would just be a couple of lymph nodes to check that they were clear as the scan didn't show up anything there so I'm hoping for the best as far as that's concerned, hopefully it'll come back clear. ",

      "Content": "Thanks Carolyn, I opted for the implant as my local hospital do that and it was the least invasive option, any of the other options would have taken longer with longer recovery times and I would have had to go to another hospital where they have a plastic surgeon - I just wanted to get it done asap and to try and get back to as near normal as possible (although I realise that normal will never be the same again)  I think the practical side of things are worrying me most at the moment like being unable to do things and losing my independence, having to rely on others - I'm rubbish at that, lol ",

      "Content": "Thanks for that Carolyn, it's doing the things I take for granted that I'm dreading not being able to do - like being able to do my hair, dress in my usual clothes (everything I have goes over my head - nothing front fastening!!) , drive my car and pick the grandchildren up (ages 4 & 1) -  cleaning up doesn't bother me really, although my hubby  is not an obsessive cleaner he will do the basics, lol - that will have to sort itself out Shopping, I'm planning on the Internet route so shouldn't be a problem, just facing my shortcomings will be the trial - I'm not used to relying on others - usually the other way round - I'm the one that looks after everyone else.  As I'm writing this I'm thinking \"what an idiot\", get a grip, but ",

      "Content": "Thanks Grogg, my DCIS covers a large area so it was recommended to have a mastectomy and not a lumpectomy, a bit of a shock at first but I keep telling myself it could have been so much worse as it doesn't appear to have spread anywhere else - hopefully they will confirm this after my op. Just getting more anxious as it approaches!",

      "Content": "I had a left breast mastectomy with an immediate implant reconstruction on 23rd May. 2 1/2 weeks on I am still sore but getting better every day. The 2 worst bits for me were firstly the drain bag which I had in for 10 days, it was uncomfortable and restricting but the hospital provided me with a bag, which I attached a long strap to and wore it over my shoulder which made it a bit easier (it hurts like mad if you get up and forget about it) it's now a week since the drain came out and I'm moving about much more easily. The second thing was awful constipation because of the painkillers, I have never experienced anything like it - I contacted my GP who gave me some Laxido which helped get me moving again, it took a few days but I'm back to normal now (I also stopped taking the cocodomol and just stuck to paracetamol, preferring to be a little less comfortable in the breast area rather than the bottom area) I'd recommend having a supply of Laxido or something similar and taking it from the start if you can. Apart from that front fastening, loose clothes are a godsend, I got a couple of soft front fastening bras and a few shirts which I'm still wearing till I get movement back in my arm properly. Doing the excercises every day is important too, not too much but as much as you can manage, that too is getting easier every day. I'm starting to feel like I can do a bit more now, I've rested every day and my husband has sorted meals out and kept the kitchen clean and tidy, I'll get to the rest of the house at some point when I feel able, probably next week, till then it can wait",
