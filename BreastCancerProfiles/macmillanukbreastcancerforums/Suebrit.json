    "Content": "Hello Ansi, it's highly unlikely that you are still posting on this forum as it's now October 2017 but I wanted to say thank you your post made me laugh. I have been crying all day, I have been on letrozole for two years now for breast cancer prevention and I'm really struggling with permanent blues. I also have reflux which gives me a sore throat every time I eat and this had become a trigger for me to become sad. Anyway three years to go Hope I make it!",
