      "Content": "Hi there, Thank you for sharing your comments about the Macmillan adverts, and I'm sorry to read your posts and the upset they have caused. Of course, this is never our intention when trying to raise money or to raise awareness of Macmillan\u2019s services. I want to reassure you that we are very much aware of this discussion post as it has been running a couple of years and we have responded previously to concerns raised. I've passed your most recent comments on to our feedback team. If you have anything you would like to pass on directly, you may like to do this via our feedback form. Kind regards, Jess Macmillan Online Community Team",
