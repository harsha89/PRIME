      "Content": "Hi Emily  I too have been diagnosed recently with HEr2 and ER and lol    on Christmas Eve... and like you was thrown into turmoil of trying to get to grips with everything and finding it so scary and daunting . But as you have found out there is so much love support and hands on face it , done it and overcome  it advice .  That made such a difference to my ability to cope and some days i did only just manage to hang on to coping by a small thread . I am post lupectomy and 2 cycles of fec chemo in and getting to feel more in control and although in the early days I was a mess of bewildered emotion and fear of the unknow. As I write this i struggle to convey all I would like to in offering you support so i will jump to practical advice  take all the help you can,so that  when your friends offer help , best to bat that straight back ask for a specific task such as lifts  or having the kids for tea on certain nights, dont be shy ,your friends and family need to be needed... they cant do the medical stuff but they want so badly to do something, give them a job they so they feel they are fighting this with you , become a team to get you through this. My first chemo pushed me to my physical limits with severe headaches , crippling stomach cramps and hideous nasuea etc ( I have had 4 kids ) i thought i was tough but this absolutely floored me for a week . I asked for stronger drugs to cope and was given a more expensive drug called Epimed ( i think ,sorry thrown the packet away ) but wow it was a revelation ........ they dont give it out as standard due to cost , but if you have a young family you need to have all the help you can with the side effects . this drug made such a BIG difference  Order head scarves and hats i found suburban turban really good fitting and stylish Book your wig fitting asap as it takes a while to get it as you have to order one after the fitting  Take laxatives as the constipation is horrid and usually followed by he runs!!!! ooh are you being treated at Leicester Royal as that is where I am receiving my treatment ? I always feel that we run the 'race 'of treatment and it can feel a long way to the finish line but we  get there with our friends and family cheering and urging us on every step of the way, you will triumph and get to that finish line , Although it probably feels like a marathon and some ones tied your legs together !!! I so hope this has been some help ,its a comfort to me to read that someone has the same cancer to me and the double wamee of treatment for both types , maybe that is the key to this , not feeling alone.  your friend Juliet I",
