    "Content": "Hi, can't say I have heard about fasting. I have just had my 3rd session of chemo and didn't feel to bad with the side effects so far. I have tried to eat as healthy food as possible, e.g I have lots of fruit and veg, buy organic when possible and have cut out booze. I have read that cutting out dairy is beneficial, not so much for the side effects but in reducing the growth of cancer cells. Hopefully you will not be to bad with the side effects, but make sure you take the anti sickness pills and if you do get any bad effects make sure you tell your breast care nurse who can try different drugs.",
