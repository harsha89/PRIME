      "Content": "Hi Mariana. I am fairly new to this site too but the support that you get on here is amazing. I am 72 and also live in Kent but this is a big county so you could be miles away from me.  I am so sorry to hear about your problem and cannot imagine what you must be going through. My heart goes out to you if you are anywhere near Medway Maritime hospital there is a fantastic support group who meet on the 1st Tuesday of the month in the evening and you would be surrounded by ladies who are so welcoming. Please come along if you are in this area and I will see you there although as I am going in for a mastectomy on Thursday I am not sure if I will be going on 4th Dec. I can give you a contact number though. If you are not in this area check out with your Macmillan nurse whether there is a group in your area keep strong Ros x",

This lasted about 45 minutes and The following day I had my  first appointment where I had my picc line fitted and I think that I had a blood test at this time.Also at this appointment I had my first chemotherapy where they hooked me up to a drip but because of the type of chemo I am having the nurse has to sit with me and put in the chemo by hand into my picc line. This lasts about 45 minutes and I am then able to go home. The hospital has also given me all my appointments until the end of chemo. As I have a picc line fitted I have to go once a week to have it flushed through to prevent any infections. You might not have a picc line fitted but because my veins are not strong enough I had to have one. I was quite happy to have one as it means I don\u2019t have to have cannula put in each visit I hope I have answered your question but as I said hospitals don\u2019t all work the same Good luck and I hope your chemo goes well.

Having said that I want to thank all of you who have taken the time to reply to my post. It has certainly given me pros and cons and I think that on balance I won\u2019t go for the implant. I have an appointment to see my Macmillan nurse today so will also talk it over with her. I am 72 with a very active social life and I just want to get this over with although I perhaps am being a bit too simplistic. I understand that if I have the implant my body could reject it and then it will mean further operations. My surgeon seemed so surprised when I said I didn\u2019t want the implant so I changed my mind and said I would go for it but I was in shock as I thought they would have removed all the cancer with the 2 lumpectomies so this news came as a bolt out of the blue. I still have 3 weeks to wait for the op. Apparently the tumour has been removed but I have a lot of pre cancer cells remaining and as I am HER2 positive they need removing. Thank you to you all and good luck with all your battles. ",

We are human after all and the nights are long! i was diagnosed after a mammogram in June. I had no lump or outward sign of cancer but I was one of the forgotten ones who was not called for the final mammogram. Thank goodness I attended when I got the letter as I thought quite wrongly that I did not need to go for any more mammograms.  Again a sincere thank you from the bottom of my heart as I don\u2019t feel quite so alone now and if you do have a meet up please count me in",

I think I can live without a breast although the scar is not pretty. I really hope that I am making the right decision and I have to phone my nurse tomorrow to confirm my decision as I wanted a night to think about it. I must be the most indecisive person going as I sway between the implant and the prosthesis but the prosthesis is getting the final vote All your comments have helped me to come to this decision. If I was 20 years younger I would have no hesitation in going for an implant but the prosthesis that I was shown looked and felt very real and if something goes wrong with it I can get another one without the need for any further operation. i was also told today that I will need chemo and Herceptin which I did not think I would need so it all just seems overwhelming at the moment.

The reason it has taken so long is that I had to have 2 lumpectomies and there are still cancer cells remaining which has resulted in me needing a mastectomy. In between the lumpectomies I had to wait for the histology reports (2 weeks) and then wait for another theatre slot. I live in the South East of England ( Kent)  and it is so busy here with long waiting lists for anything. However the cancer teams are very good and the Macmillan nurses are excellent and very supportive. Do you have them in Australia?  I am hoping that I will be able to get a theatre slot in the next 2 weeks now I have made my decision not to have a reconstruction  i hope that everything is going well for you and that you are now cancer free.

      "Content": "Hello JayJ. I was diagnosed with lobular cancer which is HER 2 positive and following 2 lumpectomies I had to have a mastectomy to get rid of the cancer. I decided not to have a reconstruction after lots of advice on this site and have not regretted it for a minute, it is so easy to just put a prosthesis into your bra and nobody would know the difference.  Buy yourself a good bra and a front fastening one is best. I bought a couple one from M&S and one from Royce lingerie which is the one that I found most comfortable. It os supposed to have healing properties and has no seams which could irritate your scar. If you look at their website and go to post surgey bras you will see it. It has front poppers but the only problem is that they only do it in that awful beige colour. It is a bit more expensive than Marks at £36 but worth it. Anyway to get back to the operation I had no problems. I had a seroma which had to be drained once but it was fine after that and I must say that the wound was nowhere near as painful as I thought it would be.in fact it is still numb now 2 months on.  Just make sure you do the exercises so your arm does not seize up and follow all the instructions they give you. I had my mastectomy in November and I am back to normal now going down the chemo route. I just wish I had had the mastectomy straight away instead of going through 2 lumpectomies first. i was only in hospital overnight and they took the drain out before I left which was probably a bit quick which is why I got the seroma. I am sorry that I cannot help with the DCIS as my cancer is different. I will be going on to Herceptin in March I think. Please keep posting on this site as I don\u2019t think I could have got through all this without all the helpful tips but remember that everyone reacts differently so just get as much info as you can and then make your own mind up. Good luck with your future treatment as you cannot have it easy with your husband with Parkinson\u2019s. My heart goes out to you Rosie x",
