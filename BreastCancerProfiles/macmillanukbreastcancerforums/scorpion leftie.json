      "Content": "Hi Moresleep Really appreciate your help. The TRAM is sort of a last resort these days  - I\u2019ve come across a lot of threads from about 10 years ago but not much recently.  I had my follow up appointment with the PS yesterday and he has put my mind at rest somewhat by drawing out how much of the muscle he took as a percentage of the entire set.  He said I can start resuming normal duties - my no housework break is over Xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had left MX with immediate muscle sparing TRAM reconstruction. Just over 6 weeks post op and just about feeling myself again.  Whilst wounds etc are healing well, I'm concerned about what I can lift and shift in the future. My surgeon reassured me that I will still have enough muscle to resume exercise and stuff and it would really only stop me from doing stuff like back flips (no I'm not a gymnast!), however there is a  hospital in the US that no longer offers the TRAM due to the limit on the weight you can lift post op. Anyone out there been through the TRAM ? What was your personal experience? ",

      "Content": "Hi Violet25, I totally agree with all the ladies that have replied thus far. I had a left side MX followed by a muscle sparing TRAM reconstruction just over 6 weeks ago (was scheduled for DIEP but my blood vessels were too small which meant a higher risk of failure for the flap). My wounds are completely healed, however my stomach still tightens over the course of the day and I still get pain in the breast. I developed chording about 3 weeks after  (my own fault for overdoing the knitting I think) but that seems to have improved with the extra stretches I am able to do now. As for the shooting pains, I was told they can go on for up to 6 months whilst the nerves repair themselves. For me, 5 weeks was almost like the turning point when I felt well enough to go out more and start doing more around the house. I went for my first trip to a shopping centre at the weekend but did chill on the sofa whilst hubby whizzed round the shop!  I'm 49. Doing the supermarket already is pretty good going! Take Care  and take it slow and steady. xx",
