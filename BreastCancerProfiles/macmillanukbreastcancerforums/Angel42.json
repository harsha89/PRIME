      "Content": "Hiya,  I\u2019m new to this group but was on the triple negative breast cancer group.  I\u2019m asking this for my sister who was diagnosed with triple negative BC two years ago, no lymph node involvement. After chemo, radio therapy, lumpectomy, capecitabine oral chemo she then discovered another lump in nearly exactly the same place. Cells that were missed apparently and have grown since treatment stopped so a double mastectomy and reconstruction later in Nov 2018 my sister asked if there was anything she could take for prevention.  She tolerated chemo very well the first time so thought this would happen again.  My sister had her first lot of Carboplatin for prevention on Tuesday, weds night we ended up in A&E as she couldn\u2019t keep anything down.  I guess we wanted to know anyone else\u2019s experiences of CARBOPLATIN and any good anti sickness drugs.  Thank you all.  I never ever want to see my sis suffering like that again x",
