So much so that although I was told I would be in until at least Monday, they let me home Sat afternoon.  The surprise and joymwhen I rang my husband I wish I could've seen his face.  He can't seem to do enough for me... Long may it last.  My drain was hardly needed on the Friday night and my arm movements were \"fantastic\" they said. My appointment for the biopsy is the 14th October, but I feel Very Confident. More than I have before. I am very lop sided as they have not put a full implant in and it'll be 4 to 6 weeks before they start doing that.  So I shall get in touch with the breast care nurse to see about a filler for my bra,    But till then my good old baggy sweaters Thank you ALL for your kind thoughts will be back again soon. Love  Celia  XXX",

It's like having a lot of Cat-naps.  I would LOVE to lay down at10pm and wake when the alarm goes off at 6. I'm also suffering alot of panic/anxiety attacks.  The goalposts have moved so many times.  What was originally DCIS is now cancer. with extensive DCIS in the right breast, hence the mastectomy. I also have alot of \"what ifs\" My best bet just before bed is a milky ovaltine. I too have been tidying, but mainly so son/hubby can find things.  My houseis organised chaos, but I KNOW where everything is. Good luck with your op Hugs to ALL cELIA X",

It sems that if my body has rejected one implant it may well reject further implants.   The other alternatives are the \"flaps\" which I REALLY didn't want to go thru. Which is why I went for immediate implants. The other problem is that I have  eczyma attacking my scars, and I could pull my hair out, along with the breast (which I don't have any more    lol)  I've been prescribed creams, and they clear it up very well. But..... as soon as I stop using it, it comes back.     But hey ho....... I'M STILL HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!   Thanks again Celia    (aka wench)",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon, Been thinking of you.  I too went thru my house like a \"dose of salts\" so my husband and son didn't have to bother too much with the cleaning.  My son was going to keep on top of the laundry after he finished work (and he was pretty good too for a 23 yr old \"boy\" (lol)  My sister also made several meals to put in my freezer, as if it was left to husband/son we'd be living on take aways or fry ups!!!!!!! My husband agreed with me, that I should do whatever the consultant suggested as they know best.  They are dealing with these problems 24/7.  I do not regret it for one minute. Like Janet I went for immediate reconstruction. I was tender for a while, but am gradually getting some feeling back.  Once the swelling had gone down I was able to wear my normal bra (a mere 36 B) and feel quite fine.  No one would know I'd had the op. I start the inflation this Thursday, and although I'm not too sure of the proceedure I KNOW I'm in good hands. You have MADE THE RIGHT DECISION andin a few weeks you'll wonder why you were so worried.   I was cutting back my conifers yesterday.  less than 5 weeks after the operation. All the best for Monday, and shall look forward to hearing from you soon. You are in my prayers nightly Love Celia X",

The consultants wouldn't advise such an operation if it wasn't necessary. I had my first op. to remove DCIS at the end of June, then another to remove more tissue that had cancer cells in.  They found I had extensive DCIS so to avoid it becoming full blown \"invasive\" cancer, they removed my breast.  I had immediate reconstruction, with an implant 4 weeks ago.  I am up and running (literally) and am just waiting to hear from the hospital for the reconstruction to continue.  I do Thank God everyday that I listened asnd took the consultants advice.

I too had extensive calcification in my breast, as I said before, and my lymph nodes were clear.  They do do a biopsy on the breast once its removed, and I've needed no chemo or radiotherapy.  I also had immediate reconstruction. They've placed an implant in the breast, at the same time as the mastectomy, and  I've heard today that they start \"inflating\" it next Thursday. The scar is \"no big deal\" it will fade, so I've been told, and I'm not going to have a nipplereconstruction or the tattoo around it.  Yes I've shed a few tears but each day it gets better.  I not shed a single tear since my operation. I read alovely verse in a Sunday supplement, (about a week after my diagnosis:-  Yesterday is history,  Tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift, that'swhy it's called \"the present\"   Think about that one.

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in June last year. My GP thoughT my lump was a cyst. It turned out to be DCIS. After my first op to remove the lump, they found that it had spread. I had to have another op, together with lymph nodes being removed. They were clear. They then discovered that my breast was FULL of pre cancerous cells so off came the breast.  That was 12 months ago. My husband had been out of work for 12 months, and I was doing general house cleaning for 3 people in our village. I had only 2 weeks off work after each op. You must listen to your body, do your excerises, and when you feel that you've \"nearly\" had enough S T O P.   I also had implants inserted at the time of my mastectomy, with regular inflation every 6 weeks.  I was able to go on walks with my husband, due to him being out of work, which also helps. Again only as far as I felt able. My husband got a job on the 11th October, and my results were for the 14th, my sister came with me, and I was given the ALL CLEAR. I had no radio and no chemo.   Remember listen to your body, it does tell you when to stop. All the very best  Celia  ",
