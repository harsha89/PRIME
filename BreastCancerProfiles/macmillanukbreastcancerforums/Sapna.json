      "Content": "Hi to all of you who replied! I am overwhelmed by the response and am truly grateful to you all for your kind words and wisdom. I had my appointment today where the result of the second biopsy came back as noninvasive. However the surgeon said it was high grade and that he recommends removing the tumour and the sentinel lymph for biopsy. He said that he will know more after this procedure. It may turn out to be invasive.????? Anyway I have surgery on Saturday but have to have a 'wire' placed in the breast on Friday. Idid take a good friend( a fellow club member) who was able to explain things later. My brother came too but was very emotional understandably. I sat my daughter down today and explained the whole thing in the most positive way could. She was amazing!!! I know it's not plain sailing but at the moment I'm feeling calm. I know I'll freak as Friday approaches but one step at a time. Now I've got to tell my friends...and boss...",

      "Content": "I am 50 with a teenage daughter and have just been diagnosed through a routine screening. I've had 2 biopsies and get the result of the 2nd tomorrow and discover the extent of the problem. My imagination is going crazy and am terrified if it has spread to lymphs etc. I know I will have to have surgery but fear everything! Anyone been throughout this lately?",

      "Content": "Hi Esther, Thanks for your encouraging reply. I wasn't sure about work on the healthy breast. Iwas worried about that but thought it was the least ofmy worries. I will talk to the surgeon about this. Did you have this done as part of your treatment or was it separate?I am in London. You sound very optimistic and positive. The word invasive sound so doesn't it? Sorry for sounding Ike a rambling fool but just processing it all at the moment. Will keep you posted. Good luck with RT and tamoxifen. XxSapna",
