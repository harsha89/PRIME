      "Content": "Thanks for all your replies.  It has put my mind at rest and I do intend telling my Oncologist when I see him this week, although I did tell him about the increase in night-time visits to the loo after Chemo no.3 and he did'nt make anything of it.  I haven't drunk any alcohol since my diagnosis and I don't drink coffee anyway.  I do like my tea, although I am down to one or no cups a day at the moment as it tastes foul with the changes of taste I have had!  Even water tastes disgusting but I am making myself drink plenty as I know if there is any chance of infection then that's what I must do anyway.  I'll  just be so relieved when I have finished the Chemo, but then I'm on to Herceptin and Radiotherapy so dont know if my poor bladder will get chance to recover! Thanks again",

      "Content": "I am having FEC chemotherapy - had number 4 (of 6) 2 weeks ago.  After no. 3 I started going to the toilet a lot more -  4 times a night on average!  However, my temperature was fine, I didn't have 'burning' or any other symptoms,  had my urine tested but all was ok.  This last time however - no. 4 - things have been considerably worse.  I am going a lot more in the day as well as night, everything else (temp etc. all ok), but sometimes I feel an urgent need to wee and then find I have to squeeze it out to start it off! Some days are okish and then other days I'm on the loo about every 30 mins /hour!  I must tell you that I do drink plenty of fluids, but always have done, so have not really increased my total input that much since I started Chemo as I have always drunk several litres a day anyway.  I spoke to the BCN last week and she just said that the Chemo can effect the mucus linings of the bladder and other parts of our innards!  My question is, does anyone else have this, will it get worse after no. 5 and 6 and does it go back to normal after finishing Chemo?  My Oncologist did say he was looking to reduce my doseage of Chemo after this one (nothing to do with the bladder probs) so maybe this will help?",
