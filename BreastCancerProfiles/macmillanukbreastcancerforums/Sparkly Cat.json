    "Content": "I'm 33 and this September I got engaged, Yay! The following month I discovered a lump in my breast and it's cancer.I feel I've been lucky in a way because I have had 4 different doctors tell me it feels benign, and countless others tell me it's rare to get breast cancer at my age, so I was very lucky my GP took it seriously and referred me for a needle test. I'm currently waiting for biopsy results on another lump they found in my other breast- yes I have 2! This second one is bigger and only shows up on MRI scans; the numerous examinations, ultrasound, and mammogram I had failed to spot it, so if it wasn't for the first little fella I might not have found it until it was lots bigger. Lucky really.",
