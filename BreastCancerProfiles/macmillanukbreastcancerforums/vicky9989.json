      "Content": "Thank you so so much for your lovely replies Annie, Wendy and June, it has calmed me down! especially when Annie you mentioned that your aunt had breast cancer and went on to live to 101! Truly amazing! It gave me the reassurance that if it is BC it doesn't nessesarly mean life will be cut short, so thank you so much for that ❤️❤️ Also have took your advice and tried to push myself and take girls out of the house to stop me dwelling, and it does work once I'm out . I wish you all the best in your journey, huge respect and love to you ladies that have gone or are going through it ❤️ And of course will update  you when I know more. Vicky xxx",

I want to live until I'm old and grey and to watch my babies grow   I will try my best to step away from google from now on as it's feeding my anxiety xxx",

      "Content": "Good evening, I've been lingering for a few days and I really need to talk to someone. I'm 27 and have only really started to examine my breasts properly this last month or two. Well I found what feels like a pea sized lump on my left breast, went to the doctors and originally she wanted to wait to see if it disappeared after my period in 2 weeks but I went back today as noticed my nipple sinks in a little bit when laying down and I now have a scan next week. I have totally convinced myself I have it and I won't have long left. The only reassurance I am taking is that it seems to move around quite easy. I have no history of breast cancer in my family but I am worrying myself sick, I can't focus on anything else and I'm finding it hard to carry on with life, just constantly sitting on my phone googling I have two young daughters and I'm so so scared. Is anyone in the same position at the moment waiting for tests?? Petrified",
