      "Content": "Has I had a nipple sparing skin sparing double mastectomy and immediate reconstruction using implants on Thursday 10th may... I had four drains still have 3. Two are draining under 50ml one (placed near the implant) is still draining 50ml... im desperate to go home I'm not in any pain. But the surgeons are advising against it as the drain near the implant is still draining to much fluid...I asked if I can not just empty it but they said no because of the 'risk of infection' which could result in having to remove my implants . Anyone else had this problem???",
