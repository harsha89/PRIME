I\u2019m sorry for this late reply but I\u2019ve only just got use to using the site. I\u2019m due for a second CT scan next week. I find the worse part is going back to the oncologist for the results. I\u2019m always so fearful. Sending all best wishes.",

      "Content": "Thanks dear for getting in touch. The kindness I\u2019ve received restores my faith in humanity. I find the hardest part is the unpredictable nature of cancer. But, today I\u2019m okay. I never say I\u2019m battling cancer. My approach is I\u2019m living with it. Still hate it though!! ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with grade two breast cancer in June 2018 which has spread into my bones. The breast cancer team at my local hospital decided not to perform breast surgery, I\u2019m in my seventies. I have been prescribed Letrozole. However, I\u2019m confused I\u2019ve read that Letrozole is more effective after the primary site cancer has been removed. Any help please.",
