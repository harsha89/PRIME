My cancer is oestrogen based so limited with that. I looked on the forum some months back and bought the yes range moisturiser and lubricant but it doesn't help. When me & my partner try sex, within seconds i am red raw and screaming in agony! Not in a good way!  Is this the forever now? I am currently on herceptin and tamoxifen. Tracey x",

Like you said (and a friend of mine) if we don't speak up about poor care and treatment then nothing will change and this idiot will continue to give poor care to other people. I don't want anyone else to feel the way i did so i will be complaining for sure. Thank you for giving me the strength and support i needed. Tracey x",

      "Content": "Hi all, just looking for some advice. I went to see my oncologist consultant today as i was advised by my herceptin nurse and the chemo nurses. I am having problems with peripheral neuropathy and wanted some advice and my herceptin nurse suggested pyridoxine a vitamin b6. But my consultant dismissed everything i said, didn't offer any help or advice and basically said these side effects are to be expected. He then asked if i was back at work yet and when i said no he said \"oh you're skiving then\" I came out feeling humiliated and very angry! I am now awake at 3am thinking i do not want to see him again and change consultant but i dont know how easy this is, has anyone else changed oncologist? I am left feeling more bereft and alone than ever even though I've got so far and now in radiotherapy and apart from the herceptin and tamoxifen I'm nearly finished treatment. Any advice would be helpful.",
