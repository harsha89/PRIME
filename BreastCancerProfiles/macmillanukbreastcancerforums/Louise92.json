Secondly my name isn't Tia, it stands for Thanks In Advance, I should of made that more clear    My lump doesn't hurt until you apply a bit of pressure on it. When the doctor was examining me it was quite painful and sore, otherwise you wouldn't know it's there. I've come to notice that it's got bigger as Well. The big C word petrifies me, I've had 2 major losses in my family within 2 & a half years because of cancer so it's quite daunting.   Thankyou all again for replying x",

      "Content": " Hello everyone, I'm 25 years old and I found a lump in my right breast Tuesday night. Now normally I'm not the one to go the doctors, buut my partner insisted I get it checked out. So I went and to my surprise they referred me to a breast clinic. The doctor said there was definitely a lump there and it could be a cyst.   I'm just wondering what everyone's lump felt like? Wether it was movable? Soft or hard? My lump is movable, however it feels like it's attached to something :/ it's very hard and the edges feel smooth and the shape of a kidney bean, other than the one side that feels attatched to something. Just looking for some advice if anyone can help?  TIA X",
