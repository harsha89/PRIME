      "Content": "I have lost 2 nails from my right hand (thumb and index finger) with the middle finger looking to follow shortly. Unfortunately for me it was the whole nail and underneath the nail bed was dark purple and ridged - looks hideous.  I am more upset about this in a way than my hair loss as I can't disguise it and I always had long, strong, lovely nails.  Guess this is just another of the unpleasant side effects we have to put up with as cancer sufferers and in the greater scheme of things it's a minor.",
