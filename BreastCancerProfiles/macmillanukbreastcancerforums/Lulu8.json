      "Content": "Hello. Thank you Londonlass for replying to my cry for help. He did not even say anything about the little lump. Just that he thought everything looked fine?! I did wonder if he had X-ray vision!  I have spent the last day or so looking at the private cost and to be honest we don't have the money so would have to borrow it which we would do if we had to of course. However this consultant is also the man in the private sector for my area and I really don't want to see him again. I have found a clinic outside my area but would have to wait until tues to call for prices.  Pals sounds like a great idea - i will definitely look into that.  Thank you again - I've been at such a loss.

      "Content": "Wow you ladies are all incredible. I have to say I am in awe of everything you have been through, going through etc.  I will confess I had no idea of all the different types, names, places that cancer is and affects so have had to google to understand more. I agree completely that they push for you to detect your changes, seek medical help, be pro-active and so to be treated like this is what makes it so bad. To have a consultant in a specific breast clinic look at your breasts for the first time and declare \"they look healthy to me with no changes that I can see\" is totally wrong. The nurse in the room with us didn't say a word but did follow me out down the corridor and gave me a card which she underlined the numbers to call to chase if not hearing anything.  I will take on board all you have said and become pushy where I can but ultimately my stress is getting worse and i can see I'll end up having to borrow money to have a mammogram. I will say though that nothing was mentioned about an ultrasound - should this be standard or would I need to push for this as well? Thank you so much for all your help x",

      "Content": "Hello. Thank you so much for replying. This is my biggest fear - that the reassurance is inaccurate. That all the time waiting is delaying potential treatment should it be necessary. I'm so sorry that you have had to go through all of that. I hope you are getting better treatment now? I was at the breast clinic seeing the consultant and having googled since it would seem this man is the main person for my county NHS & private!!  Not sure how to go about self referring for an urgent mammogram - but will look into it. Thank you again for your support. It is really appreciated x",

      "Content": "So finally had my mammogram today via NHS (private cost was way too much so had to wait for NHS appt)....since my visit to the consultant two weeks ago I now have a lump .  The lady who did the mammogram was amazing and although painful on the left breast was so understanding and easy to talk too. Now to wait....she advised I would hear by next Wednesday if anything has been found and further tests needed. Hope all the ladies who responded to my last posts are ok?? ",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm really in need of some advice. I have had pain in my left breast for 7 weeks. It has got worse. It has now started travelling into my armpit and my arm has a kind of dead arm feeling. My nipple is so sensitive and I feel like there is a pulling inside of my breast from my nipple inwards. The pain is a dull ache all the time but throughout the day it becomes a throbbing fire type pain. On the area around my nipple there is a small lump like a spot but has no head to it. I believe that my breast is pulling towards my armpit. After three visits to the gp I was referred to the breast clinic and I finally had my appt today. The consultant made me feel like a little girl with anxiety issues. He was very arrogant and bolshy. Did not seem to take anything I said in to account and didn't even ask my family history. His examination was thorough, although despite me telling him the pain was inside my breast and I can happily touch the outside of it fine, said that as I did not hurt when it was touched the breast tissue was obviously ok. HE could not see any changes - not that he'd seen me before! He told me that because of my \"anxieties\" I had \"put 2 +2 together and equalled 5.  I calmly explained that I had not done anything like that. That I was concerned because my maternal aunt had been misdiagnosed with muscular pain in her breast and when the cancer was finally found it was too late - it had travelled to lymph nodes, bone before hitting the spine and then the brain. She was 49 when she died and it only took a year. He then said that was unfortunate. He agreed to send me for a mammogram but I would have to wait for an appt. He had the power to send me today but chose not to. I am so worried. The pain is not any better. Pain pills are not touching it. Apologies for such a long post. Any advice??",

      "Content": "Latest update - have been advised that as consultant appt was only Friday I have to at least wait a week before any chasing can be done. That this consultant is the main one for both NHS and private care in and around my area! He is so highly thought of by anyone who has dealt with him - they think he's wonderful. I'm beginning to think I'm going slightly mad - I have no idea why my appt was so awful and why he treated me so badly when he is allegedly so great??  So am back to waiting until Monday before I can chase again. I live in north Hertfordshire so the hospitals mentioned are quite far away and unlikely I would ever get an appt there.  Feeling deflated x",
