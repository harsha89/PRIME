      "Content": "Thank you all for your wonderfully kind and supportive words - I really appreciate them.  I've not been around here much as I've been coming to terms with everything, but I did read your messages and felt a little better each time. So...update from me?  It's invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, 2 tumours (5cm and 4cm) in my right breast.  The bigger tumour at the side of my breast actually HURTS, is that normal???  The FNA didn't indicate any cancerous cells in my nearby lymph node at this point, but we won't know until surgery for sure.  It's hormone receptive, so I'm on Tamoxifen now, and the schedule/order of other treatments has changed a bit.  I'll be having mastectomy, probably with immediate reconstruction, in early-ish January and starting chemo soon afterwards.  After that, almost certainly radiotherapy to my chest wall at the very least. I'm not feeling too bad right now, though I have days when I'm less positive.  I know I'll get much more ill (from treatment) before I get better, but that's just the price I'm going to have to pay to beat this. On the bright side, my friends and family are being amazing - so supportive!  And my sense of humour is holding up so far.  I'm due to see my BC nurse tomorrow to discuss surgical options, and I'm having an MRI on Thursday to check my other breast as my age means the mammography wasn't entirely conclusive. Hope everyone here is having as good a day as possible, and that we all come through the other side of this crazy battle kicking. Gill x",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, So...I'm pleased to meet you all, but I can't say I don't wish it were under different circumstances for all of us.  ;) My name's Gill.  I'm 40 years old and a bombshell dropped into my life last week when I was told, after tests at the local breast unit, that I have breast cancer.  I don't know very much more at the moment, though scans show that the main tumour is probably 8-9cm and there's a small one nearby, but in the same breast.  I had all my staging tests this week (x-rays, ultrasounds, bloods, bone scan) and the big results/treatment plan meeting is next Tuesday. I'm finding the waiting really difficult, because now that I know this thing is there, I just want to get on with treatment - however horrible it might be - and do my best to get through it and (eventually) on with my life.  Although we don't know much for sure right now, the consultant's first opinion was that neo-adjuvant chemo, mastectomy and then radiotherapy would probably be the recommended plan, perhaps followed by hormone/biotherapy depending on what the biopsy analyses showed about the tumour cells' response. I'm grateful to have found this forum, and also grateful that I live in a place where we have a fantastic breast unit, cancer centre and Maggie's Centre.  For the most part, my strong sense of humour is holding up so far, but I know that it's not very realistic to expect that to continue indefinitely, especially when I'm going through treatment and feeling rough. Hope this finds everyone having as good a day as you can. Gill x",

      "Content": "Hello RadDad, Firstly....congratulations - huge, warm congratulations - on your recent wedding to your love.  What an awful time to get such frightening news. For the record, I'm 40, Stage IIb breast cancer (invasive pleomorphic, to be precise, which makes me a bit of a rarity!), diagnosed in November 2013, skin-sparing right mastectomy, immediate expandable reconstruction and now undergoing FEC-T chemotherapy, with Herceptin to follow.  Then radiation, then tamoxifen.  The full house, as my nurse put it! As others have said, that stunned, numb feeling is very common at first when it's all new, crazy and suddenly your expections of how your near future is going to pan out are completely turned upside down.  I didn't even cry, really, for at least a week after I found out.  I couldn't think, wandered around like a zombie, and couldn't really express myself.  I kept looking at my 5 year-old son and wondering if he'd grow up without his mummy. After that, things all moved fairly fast (waiting is an awful but inevitable part of the process, however) with treatments, tests, surgery, consulations, chemo....then I'll be having radiotherapy and so on.  Honestly, I have a suspicion I'll get right to the end of treatment, then completely break down with post-traumatic stress disorder or similar.  I think it's natural to go into survival mode, just pressing on with each step needed to beat this awful disease. These forums, a few choice and sensible websites (as others have said, BEWARE GOOGLE, DANGER WILL ROBINSON!) and my medical team have been incredibly helpful and supportive.  Yes, it's a very scary diagnosis, but as many have said, treatment has come along in leaps and bounds in the last couple of decades and the outcome for breast cancer is now much, much more positive than it's ever been. Your wife will need all your support, love and reassurance, and it sounds like you're absolutely prepared to give it.  Make sure you get some support for yourself, too, though - it's hard watching the person you adore going through such a traumatic experience, and it will take its toll on both of you.  Making sure that you're fully supported - both as a couple and individually - will help give you the strength you need to fight through all the challenges ahead, and help you to look forward to the probability of long, healthy and cancer-free life in the future. Sorry if I'm not being all that coherent right now.  Blame chemobrain and tiredness!  ;) Huge best wishes to you and your bride.  You can do this.  Honestly - if I can, anyone can. Gill x EDITED TO ADD:  I didn't see you say where you're from, but it's well worth seeing if there's a Maggie's Centre within reaching distance.  They're a wonderful organisation dedicated to providing all kinds of support (for free) to those affected by cancer.  They've been a big help to me, and to my partner.  x",

In my case, the mammography and sonography were conclusive enough that I was given a diagnosis of definite cancer, right there and then.  I guess it varies from doctor to doctor, but mine certainly didn't hold back on the truth when I asked for it, and I appreciated her honesty.  I doubt a doctor would play things down, or up, without a good clinical reason. Good luck for you results, EmmsieD - I really do hope the results are good, and that you don't have to join this club we're all in.  But if you receive bad news, know that there's a very well-practised and well-oiled machine out there to help you through everything.  And of course, we'll be here too.

I presume you have an allocated breast care nurse (or rather, that your mum does)?  She should be able to give you some reassurance, answer any questions you have, refer your mum for counselling and so on, so it's probably worth giving her a call. The surgery will roll around sooner than you think, so perhaps spend this time finding out what you can from the BC nurse, putting some support into place, and preparing your mum for her operation with some nice button-up-front pyjamas (she'll need them for drains, etc.), slippers, a good book or two, and anything else that might make her stay more comfortable.  Oh, and those heart-shaped mastectomy pillows are a huge help, or at least were to me - so comforting and soft when you've had a lumpectomy or mastectomy, and lymph nodes removed!  I love the ones my friend gave me. Best wishes to your mum, and to you.  It's a difficult time, but she WILL get through this.  I'm 3 weeks post-mastectomy now (I'm 40), and feeling much better, though I'm a little nervous about my upcoming chemo.  It's a hard road, but a very well-trodden one.  Thinking of you.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a skin-sparing right-side mastectomy with reconstruction, and I got the pathology report back a couple of days ago.  Apparently the type of cancer I have is fairly rare, so I wondered if anyone here shared my diagnosis and wanted to hook up for support? The type of cancer I have is ER+, HER2+ Invasive Pleomorphic Lobular Carcinoma.  I had a huge primary tumour - 63mm - with others, plus widespread DCIS and LCIS in that breast, but stunningly we caught it in time for there to be no lymph node involvement.  I had six axillary lymph nodes removed on that side, and none were malignant. I'd be grateful to find out any information that any of you might know about this fairly rare type of breast cancer.  I know that HER2+ and pleomorphic cancers tend to be more aggressive, but beyond that I can't seem to find out much!

I know that some clinics are set up for quicker results than others, but in any case it's possible that you'll know - one way or the other - on the day.  I attended the Edinburgh Breast Unit, and went on my own because I thought that the worst case scenario would involve me having biopsies (plus all the stuff before that) and then going home for a week's wait for results.  However, my mammography and ultrasounds were conclusive enough that I was given a diagnosis then and there.* This will PROBABLY NOT happen to you.  The likelihood is that you'll have a clinical examination and/or mammography/ultrasound....and be discharged as they find there's no presence of cancer or anything else that's worrying.  Alternatively, they may find something like a cyst, and it may or may not need to be drained. It's probably not malignant.  Statistics support this. However, even if it is...there's a very expert, advanced and well-oiled system out there for those of us who are found, unfortunately, to have cancer.  You will be supported, held, and treated with the best that our world has to offer in the way of getting rid of it.  You will find that you have more strength than you ever dreamed possible.  And on the days when that falters a little, and all the days in-between, you'll have forums like this, full of strong, supportive, open-hearted people who know what it is to LIVE with cancer, and beyond. However worried you are (and again...it's probably not cancer!) you will be OK.  Honestly. Keep in touch and let us know your results?  :-) Gill x * Yup, I was on my own.  Wish I'd known how things can work out, as I'd have taken someone with me!",
