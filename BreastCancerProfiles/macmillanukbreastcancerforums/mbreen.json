      "Content": "Hi! My daughter has just popped up with a case of chickenpox, and I don't know what to do.  I have had chicken pox in the past, but I am also undergoing chemotherapy for for breast cancer.  We don't have any family in the area to support us, the 24/hr, 7/day a week hotline number my oncologist gave me is not answering, and it's a bank holiday weekend, so the gp won't be open on Monday.  Does anyone have any advice about this?  Has anyone had to deal with this before? I'd appreciate any help or advice.",

      "Content": "Hi! In March I was diagnosed with Stage 3, Triple negative breast cancer, and it was just the kick in the pants I needed to make the time to finish writing the book I've always wanted to write.   It's a nonfiction book that touches on topics such as love, death, cancer, education, goal-setting and healthcare.  It is also about my experiences being born in the Philippines, growing up in the American South, and living an expat lifestyle in South Korea, Denmark and England. If you're looking for some summer reading, you can find the book available for the Kindle at: http://www.amazon.co.uk/30ish-Mahalia-Breen-ebook/dp/B00KXH19N2/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_kin?ie=UTF8&qid=1402652971&sr=8-1&keywords=30ish Or if you prefer paper, you can find it at: http://www.amazon.co.uk/30ish-Mahalia-Breen/dp/1499146639/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402653106&sr=8-1&keywords=30ish Stay strong!
