      "Content": "Morning everyone  I am new to this site and just trying to navigate my way around the site. A couple of weeks ago found a large and very tender lump in my breast it was hard to detect as it is behind the breast . It can only be felt when my arm is raised . The biopsy confirmed it is cancer, even the mammogram couldn't pick it up   . I have been suffering from back ache and rib pain for some time now ,so obviously I'm very worried that the cancer is actually somewhere else as well . I have a clinic appt next week to find out the grade and type etc  I am trying to stay positive but I'm fearing the worst . Just wondered if anyone had any words of wisdom and any tips on keeping positive . I am normally a very happy positive person but I am up and down in my moods some days I'm ok and other days I go to pieces. I know it must sound extreme but it's such a roller coaster of emotions . Kind regards ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone  This is only my second post on the site I was diagnosed with BC on the 15th March at the age of 51, I'm 2 weeks post lumpectomy and lymph node excision  x 6 . I saw the cons last week and I'm triple negative BC with a grade 3 tumour , lymphs were all clear luckily. They didn't really explain anything else , when I've googled TNBC it's all doom and gloom . Although  I'm trying to stay positive I keep having occasional panic attacks and I'm very scared of recurrence in the next couple of years .  This has been a massive shock to me and I feel at times I'm struggling with the diagnosis . I know this must be normal in the first few weeks just wondering if these feelings always remain .  I start FEC chemo soon then radiotherapy but haven't been given dates yet . I would be grateful of anyone's experiences or advise .  King regards  Kath ",

      "Content": "Hi D  Thank you so much for yr reply it really does help chatting to others who are going through a similar journey . It must have been such a shock for you , but I have found myself embracing the little things in life and looking at the positives for example : I have a supportive partner , the chemo will be continuing into the summer and hopefully will make me feel a little happier as I can enjoy the garden and nice walks . I am good at putting make up on and can do eyebrows well  I don't have children to consider so can rest whenever I want . I know that a lot of women might not have these things in their life and I've got to think myself lucky in a way that I have these things . I do worry about my future but hopefully new treatments could be available in the next few years for triple negative cancers . They say the journey is a roller coaster and I'm finding every day is different . I really hope we can chat and support each other through this as I know it will get us through .  Regards  Kath ",
