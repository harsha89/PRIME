      "Content": "DIEP Flap or Implants...How to choose? Options \u200e22-01-2016 09:09 PM Hello Ladies,   I was looking to learn from your experiences on the reconstruction choices you have made.   I have just finished my chemotherapy and will now be having my surgery. As a BRCA1 gene carrier. I have opted for a double mx with immediate reconstruction. However I'm still undecided on which route to take.   my main concerns with DIEP are the long recovery time and the scar which will be hip bone to hip bone. Also what is the cosmetic result like? With implants, the higher risk of infection is a concern. Also the fact they would need to be replaced further down the line.   I'm 31 and yet to have any children, I'm also a C cup. Thank you for reading.   Naz ",

It is ultimately your decision to make, which for me, makes it that much harder! I'm sure when your time comes, you will do what is right for you. I would discuss it at length with your oncology team. Thanks. Naz",

      "Content": "Hi Marcia, Thank you for your reply. I'm sorry to hear you had a rough time. Wow the pain sounds intense. For how long did this last? If you do work, when did you go back?  The tightness of the tummy doesn't sound like much fun! I had a SLNB back in Aug 15. My scar from that is still tender. This concerns me for the tummy scar which will be much larger. Thanks for your thoughts. Naz x ",

      "Content": "Hi Ellen, Thanks for your reply. I'm due to meet with the plastic surgeon for my possible DIEP flap on Monday. So I hope to raise my concerns with him then. It actually is the stomach pain and recovery time, which scares me the most about this particular procedure. The flat tummy is a bonus, minus the scaring! Do you have feeling in your breast? I'm glad the pain is subsiding for you. I hope your radiotherapy goes well. Thanks. Naz x",

I'm not sure if I will need radiotherapy as that has not been confirmed yet. Although, as you say with the DIEP, this hopefully should not be an issue. Thanks. Naz",
