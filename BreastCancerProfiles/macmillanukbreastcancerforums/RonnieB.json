      "Content": "I had a breast reduction of my left breast (as I didn't get clear margins on a lumpectomy) about 12 weeks ago.   I have been wearing crop tops but am quite conscious that I now have different sized breasts (my right breast is a 36FF and my reduced left breast is probably 36C) and without proper support, the right breast is quite a bit lower than the left one. I understand that I will be eligible for a reduction of my right breast in 6-12 months' time but would like to find a temporary solution in the meanwhile so would be very grateful if anyone else could recommend the best way to \"even them up\".",
