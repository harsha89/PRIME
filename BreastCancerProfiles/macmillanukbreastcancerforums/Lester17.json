I had it cut to a chin length Bob in preparation, it has thinned a lot especially on the top but with a hat on I still look like I have a full head of hair as it stayed really well round the front, back and sides. I finished chemo just over a week ago and it's already starting to thicken up and as soon as I can will get it cut short. Good luck and I hope all goes well Iona Xx",

My question is though it is still shedding and I don't know whether to just leave it or give it a good, but gentle comb to stop it appearing everywhere?
