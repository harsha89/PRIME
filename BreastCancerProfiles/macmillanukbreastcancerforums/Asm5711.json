      "Content": "What a whirlwind. Two months ago I was living life at 100mph hour with three children, work and family life. Tomorrow I face my first chemo session. I found a mass that proved significant and have since had a lumpectomy and nodes removed.  At pre-op they advised 2 out of the 30 nodes were positive (good start), however the lumpectomy margins were not clear (not so good start), indicating that it had spread...plus, I needed Herceptin (very bad start!!). Treatment plan is now chemo, surgery to check if chemo has done it's job, then radiotherapy.  So, bloods, heart scans and consent all done today. 8.30 start tomorrow morning. I'd like to say I'm positive but my overarching feeling at the min is fear. Terrified if I'm honest. I know though that this is the fear of the unknown. It has really helped reading of all your experiences and knowing signs, symptoms and tricks to help the journey.  Keep up the fight. You have each given me inspiration.  Thank you xxx",
