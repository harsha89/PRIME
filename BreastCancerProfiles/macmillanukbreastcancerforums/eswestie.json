It's really strange, I have redness all around the nipple and the nipple itself is a paler colour and almost white at times! Anyone else had this? Elaine x",

      "Content": "Hi All Some advice if anyone can hep me please. I had a lumpectomy for a small 10mm invasive tumour last December  and seven ymph nodes removed, all negatve. Following this I had nineteen sessions of radiotherapy. I also had a post op infection. I got the all clear in January. Since them I have lymphodema in my arm but wear a sleeve as prescribed by the lymphodema nurse. The last three weeks my breast has got progressively more red and swollen and hard. I went to my GP last night and he felt a 'lump the size of a plum' in my breast which was so painful when he located it I nearly shot through the ceiling! He acted very worried, has put me on antibiotics in case its an infection but has arranged an urgent scan for me Monday. I am obviously thinking the cancer has returned with a vengence. Has anyone else experienced thiis type of reocurrence so soon after the intial diagnosis and removal? I had a quick look on the net and redness and swelling is indicative of a breast cancer reoccurence. Just thought I would see if you guys had anything to add to advise me. Thank you all so much for reading. I am quite scared at this moment in time. Love to you all Elaine xx",

      "Content": "Hi Chilli and Lulu   Thank you so much for you advice and answering my post. You have allayed my fears and really laughed about the Dr Google remark.....so true! My cancer was a Grade 1. I will post on here to let you know how I get on, to be honest I was starting to worry about Inflammatory BC as my breast appearance matches all the signs and symptoms and looks like all the photo's......but as you rightly say it would be unlikely at this stage. Thank you again, it meant a lot to not feel alone. And its a good place to come and share. Good luck with your progress through this illness and please feel free to write to me if I can every lend an ear or help in anyway. Lots of love Elaine xx  ",
