I am a really strong person as a rule also and I am always at the gym/running and taking part in OCR's (tough mudder style races - 15 a year!) which really helps with my PTSD.. so I'm hoping to keep that active lifestyle up to keep my head from exploding  Best regards, Kate x",

I walk every day anyway with my labrador but can I run during it, obviously some days tiredness will dictate my activity levels but can I go for a swim etc?

This is from sustained childhood abuse and my control over my emotions has always been hard as I get regular triggers and flashbacks which is incredibly difficult to cope with and, on the top of that this chemotherapy journey is really affecting my mental and emotional health to the point where I think if I have any further treatments it will affect my mental health long term. I hope you can understand my reasons behind this decision and I have told my family and close friends this evening and they are all supportive in my decision, if it turns out to be the wrong decision then I guess its something I will have to live with but for now, I have to think about my mental health in the here and now..   I wish you all the very best in your journeys and much love xxx.",

In the last 6 weeks I have had 2 surgeries to remove my cancer, the last one was 2 weeks ago tomorrow where I had a full lymph node clearance and more healthy margin removed as it was a bit close.... anyway, yesterday I returned to hospital for my results and I'm cancer free... back to hospital on Monday morning to see Oncologist for treatment. Chemotherapy has been mentioned but not 100% sure that I will be offered it but I'm expecting it to be offered as the cancer had spread to 1.5 of my lymph nodes during the biopsy hence the clearance operation thereafter... I'm not sure if I want chemotherapy, not because I'll potentially lose my hair, that really doesnt matter to me but its the sickness and generally feeling icky afterwards.. because basically I'm being bullied at work by my Boss, he approached me last year and wanted to sleep with me and told me that if I didnt, he would make my life hell... well, at least he's true to his word, he is making my life hell and I can't afford to leave, I can't afford to sick leave during my treatment as I dont get paid sick pay and there's no-one higher to take this too and to be frank I think it would make things worse for me, I cant get any help with regards to money as I earn too much. So basically, I'm stuffed... my only option is to take radiotherapy for the 3-3.5 weeks and then start looking for another job, I'll also be on Tamoxifen for 10 years... any suggestions please?  what would you do?",
