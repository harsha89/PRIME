    "Content": "Hi, I too have this injection the day after my chemo. Have had three so far and have not had any side effects. I am on an accelerated Chemo drug trial, so have chemo every two weeks. Judging by my path results the injection has certainly done it's work as my white blood count is higher now than before I started my chemo ! Good luck, Sandra.",
