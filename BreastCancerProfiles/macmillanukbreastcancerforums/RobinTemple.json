    "Content": "Hi guys! My heart goes out to my friends who too have been diagnosed with breast cancer. I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer Stage 4 cause they initially saw a lesion on my right lung, now gone. I waited along time to share, but I am ready. Many people have said, you've got to share how you survived 6 rounds of chemo and kept your strength. Well, first of all, I thank God for keeping me and giving me the alternative medicine strategies to keep strong. The first thing I did 10 days before first chemo treatment was go on the MSM/Vit C protocol. I still take 1 tbsp. of MSM powder, 1 tsp of Vit C Buffered powder and a little bit of Stevia  3 X day. Morning and evening I add 1 Tbsp of super collagen powder by Neocell with 100 mg of HA.  3 X day I take 4 capsules of Qi Vive by Activeherb. The bible says herbs for the service of man. If you want to know more let me know, but I did not have the neuropathy talked about, the mouth problems, and the major loss of strength. There are things to take to boost RBC and  prevent infection and viruses. I had some nausea first four days after each treatment and had some hair loss. I continued to eat raw. Very important. Grace to you all. I am scheduled for a partial radical mastectomy this Friday with radiation in future. I look forward to my complete testimony coming forth. Please research the MSM/Vit C protocol. Very important! It reduces toxicity and the body's inflammatory response.  I have heard and believe it does help the chemo more effective!  I believe you will be amazed! I even have friends on it now that don't have the challenges of cancer. I have a friend who has fibromyalgia that followed my recommendations and has had tremendous relief from pain and inflammation. The Drs. are amazed because I didn't come in for treatment till things were quite advanced. My surgeon said \"I heard you had a miraculous response to the chemo\".  She had not seen me since she put my port in several months before.....Love to all, Redfire007",
