      "Content": "You'll look back on all this and realise how strong and determined that you are..  I'm 2 years on from initial diagnosis and my story/situation is very similar  November 2014 I find out that my husband of 25 years is a serial cheat.  December I find a lump in left breast January 2015 I'm accidentally given positive results over the phone by hospital admin worker whilst booking me in for CT scan.  February 2015 mastectomy.  Then it's all a blare until all treatment finished (including divorce)  All is good now, and I look back and wonder how I coped really.  I'm now on the waiting list for diep reconstruction, and although I'm worried about such a big operation, I'm going to put it out of my mind until I get an actual date.  Keep strong, you WILL get through it! ",

      "Content": "I can totally relate to that... I found a lump whilst shaving under my arms, back in November 2014. I knew it was going to be bad news.  I went to GP and was referred within a week.  Had all the tests and was told it would be a 10 day wait for results.  4 days later, I received a call from an admin worker at the local hospital, asking me if a particular date was suitable for an ECG.  When I asked what that was for, she told me it was normal procedure before starting chemotherapy!  That was how I found out I had breast cancer..  The surgeon, professor Audisio, was very apologetic as was the BCN, but could not explain why I had been informed in that way.  Anyway, all is well now after all my treatment, apart from the awful aches and pains from the exemestane I take  Best wishes to you, it'll pass by quickly once your treatment starts ",

      "Content": "Hi I too was on letrozole and was switched to exemestane because of the joint aches and pains. They were horrendous!  I have now been switched to tamoxifen even though I'm post menopausal, and I have been taking this for around 6 weeks.  I have NO joint pains or aches now, so I'm quite happy to carry on with it.  I was told by the oncologist that the letrozole and exemestane were the 'gold' treatment and its procedure that you are started on that to see if you're tolerant to it.  He was going to put me on another one but I can't remember the name of it now, but agreed that as its a similar drug the side effects would be similar.  It may be worth giving tamoxifen a try? ",
