      "Content": "Hi Kit-Kat,  I hope this finds you well.  I am now nearly 4 weeks post chemo (I had 12 week taxol). My hair started falling out after the 10th cycle, which was nearly 6 weeks ago, and hasn\u2019t stopped falling out since and I can\u2019t see any regrowth as yet. I also had 4 cycles of AC back in the summer - the 3rd and 4th cycles were delayed and, even though I lost hair back then, it started regrowing so I was surprised it started falling out again as I was told it wouldn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s too soon for me to expect hair regrowth but can you please give me an update on your situation - I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re hair regrew and you are feeling better and wondered how long after your last chemo you noticed it? Thank you for any info you can offer, Jane ",

      "Content": "Hi Leolady56, No, of course I don\u2019t mind you mentioning - thank you for your input.  Yeah, I know some of them date back a while but I was replying to someone who posted in April this year, so just wanted to know how they were getting on really... Fingers-crossed my hair will stop falling out soon - although there\u2019s nothing I can do about it and will just have to let nature take its course! Although, 1 minute I\u2019m ok about it, the next I\u2019m a all emotional but I guess that\u2019s just par for the course. Thanks again for getting in touch, I appreciate it. Take care.",
