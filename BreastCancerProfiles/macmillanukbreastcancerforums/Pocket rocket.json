      "Content": " hi all I\u2019m hoping if some of you could answer a few questions I have firstly I have been diagnosed with grade 3 invasive ductal Breast cancer ER+ PR+ HER2 negative. I have had a therapeutic mammoplasty and axillary clearance. 2 tumours (very small) and 2 lymph nodes affected. I have my first oncology appointment on the 30th October, does anyone have any idea of what type of chemotherapy drugs I will be given? Just so I have a vague idea of what to expect. Also how soon after the oncology appointment have people had to wait to start chemo after that appointment?  Also how soon after chemotherapy does your hair start to fall out? I\u2019ve decided to just shave it all off before it starts falling out, I don\u2019t want to do it to soon as my hair grows really quickly. I have always had short hair and have been having it cut shorter and shorter each time I have it cut. I don\u2019t want my children seeing my hair fall out so once it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone over and done with. Lol Emma x",

Mine has got worse with each cycle, from what I've researched it's the F part that's doing it. It's now almost unbearable (sticky saliva) I've tried everything to make it bearable but I'm struggling. Everything I eat or drink is making me gag! Has anyone dropped the F part of their chemo? Thanks Emma",

How about you? Helen xx hi Helen I have had, lumpectomy with reconstruction and node clearance. Was supposed to start chemo in the next week or so but histology showed a further very small lump in the margin, so I had to have an MRI to see if there was any more, turns out I have another lymph node affected (1 out of the 2 I have left!). So I'm back in for surgery on the 15th sept for more margin to be taken out around the 2nd lump and the affected lymph node taken out. Then it's chemo, radiotherapy for me too. Maybe we will see each other around the hospital, I seem to be there a lot at the moment! I've started calling it my second home! Emma xx",

I have to go for an MRI to check there is no more then back in for surgery again. Which puts starting chemo 6 weeks behind. Luckily only 1 out of 25 nodes removed was affected. Has anyone else experienced having more than 1 lump?",
