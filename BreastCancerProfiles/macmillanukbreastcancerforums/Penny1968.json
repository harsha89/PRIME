      "Content": "Hi Amy66 I had my mx a year ago. I took pj's with a button up top. I bought soft top bra's from Asda - as you can step into them rather than put them over your head.  I wore these for about 8 weeks in the end as they worked well with the \"softie\"  A big baggy grandad style shirt to wear home (I wore my jeans) The BCN gave me a lovely heart shaped pillow which was great for the car journey home to put between the underarm and seat belt.  As for movement, my arm was fairly stiff, but as soon as the drains were out l started the exercises given to me.  Good luck. Hope all goes to plan. Penny",

My thumb nails just peeled off within a week of my last T.  They were sore for a good few weeks! Chemo just keeps on giving doesn't it! I didn't cover them, just used lots of hand cream and rubbed vaseline on them at night.  I had my 16th Herceptin today and am glad to report my nails are fine now!",

The nail beds looked bruised, eventually all fell off. I cut them really short in the end. But am glad to report that now they look perfectly normal! So they should recover, just takes a bit of time. ",

      "Content": "I read the article but stopped once she started on about the fasting.  Great that she could afford to get the hair piece, good for her.  She said that losing her hair was \"more frightening than losing her breasts\" - not a statement that I can relate to at all. I can think of many more things worse than being without hair for 9 months.  But then again, I would happily walk around with a bald head - so not a true representation of most women. And that's the crux of my issue with this article. We all \"got through\" treatment in our own ways. No one way trumps another! ",

      "Content": "Hi.  Your reaction is perfectly normal. The fear of the unknown is worse than the treatment. I had FEC-T last year. I would speak to the Oncologist/BCN before you take any vitamins.  You will get lots of advice and support on here, ask as many questions as you like, we've all been there, done it (unfortunately!) I found the first 3 days after FEC the worst, nausea and feeling light headed. But then I started to improve. My taste buds were destroyed and I suffered with a very dry mouth through the chemo.  Don't be afraid to ask the chemo team for anything that will help. I was given lots of anti sickness drugs and even if you don't feel sick - take them. My biggest tip of all - drink as much water as you can! I tried to drink at least 8 glasses of iced water a day.  Good luck for tomorrow xx",

      "Content": "Hi Gillian,  I had a Portacath as I also had rubbish veins. It was put in (under sedation) 4 days prior to my first chemo (FEC-T) and stayed in until my 18th herceptin treatment nearly 14 months later! All my blood tests were taken from it, it was then removed under local anaesthetic 4 days after the last herceptin! Mine sat just under my collar bone, but a friends was just by her armpit. I was extremely grateful for it. Never had any issues. And pretty pain free. For me there were no downsides to having it, only pluses. Good luck with the chemo. Xx",

My hair fell out just before my 2nd FEC, but eyebrows and lashes held on until the last of the T.  Strangely by the last chemo the hair on my head was beginning to come back.  I now have a full head of hair (was fortunate to have a short style to begin with.) My eyelashes are back, just not as long as they were before   Eyebrows are back but need a bit of help with an eyebrow pencil as definitely thinner than before. ",

Like you I wanted life to get back to normal as quickly as possible. And 15 months on I am happy with the decision I made to not reconstruct. I use a variety of prosthetics and have a very supportive husband. The surgeon advised me that should I change my mind then the door is open for recon in the future.  It is a very personal choice and there is no right or wrong decision, only what is best for you.  Penny xx",

I was Diagnosed Dec14, finished my Herceptin in Feb16.  I won't lie its is gruelling and at times downright scary, but in other ways it's made me a better person.  The first few days are the worst, once you start treatment you will feel more in control. There is great support on this site and I found it invaluable whilst going through treatment. Especially in the middle of the night when wide awake due to the steroids from chemo.  We've all shared experiences, fears and tips to help get you through. Cry as much as you want! It's ok! Any questions you have, ask away! ",

      "Content": "Hi Emily!  I had the FEC-T chemo, followed with 18 rounds of Herceptin. As mentioned in a previous reply, this is started with the 4th chemo (the T part) As you are Her2 positive I am pretty sure you will be offered Herceptin.  One question for you: Are you getting a \"port-a-catch\" fitted?  If you can, get one! It sits under the skin, mine was under my collar bone and all the drugs and blood tests are administered though it. It really does make life so much easier. I didn't notice my lump getting bigger, mine was under my nipple an hard to feel - I went to the docs as my breast \"dimpled\" and had been sore for a while.  Tips for you! Chemo -  Have someone come with you if possible Drink lots of water Take all the anti sickness drugs. I was a nail biter for 46 years, and was told by the Onc stop, which I did! Paint your nails black. The T part of chemo will be cruel to them!  People won't know what to say or do! You will get some very strange comments.  Accept help if it's offered. You may be offered the cold cap to reduce hair loss. I didn't - I had very short cropped hair to start with.  Hair started falling out on day 20, so I went to the hairdresser and had it shaved off! Eyebrows/lashes went at about chemo 4 - a tip from the Onc worked, I never removed my mascara just topped it up every morning. Did I say drink lots?!!  Where are you having treatments? Look out for groups, get togethers, coffee mornings. I looked at chemo as my cancer fighting ninja drug, and if I felt like cr@p it must be nuking the cancer cells! We are all here in this unique group and will help in anyway we can. Stay strong, you can do this.  Penny",

      "Content": "Emily - am sending you a big cyber hug xx Sorry if we have overwhelmed you with info, in the days to come, you will start to feel more in control. I promise. You have only just been diagnosed, trust me, these are the worst days. I didn't stop crying for nearly 2 weeks.  Hopefully when you see the Oncologist again, you can take all the info from here and it will start to make sense.  I would say the most important thing is to get in contact with the Breast Cancer Nurse as they are invaluable. Mine was on call 24 hours a day, and would just listen to me moan if things got tough! We will still be here to help when you need us Take care Penny",
