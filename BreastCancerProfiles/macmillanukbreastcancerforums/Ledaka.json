      "Content": "Hi Angie  i had my flu and pneumonia jab 3 days before my last chemotherapy. My consultant said to have it quite close as your blood count will be better in order to fight any bad reaction. I did feel slightly unwell over the weekend but nothing too bad. Been fine with 3 rd cycle of chemo no bad reactions. Susie.",

      "Content": "Hi mandy  I'm wondering if it makes a difference in which chemo you're on. I have womb cancer and on paclitaxel and carboplatin. There is a grey area about giving flu jabs as I spoke to 2/3 of my team before going ahead with it. What they have to weigh up is the consequences of getting a bout if flu or pneumonia during theowest blood count time. Not a good place to be with lowered resistence. so I think with certain consultants they have to make that decision and stick with it. Like I said I had pneumonia in one arm and flu in the other on same day. 3 days before my next chemo so my blood count would have  almost back to normal. Susie",
