      "Content": "I have not had my hair loss YET!!! However I have ordered hair weaves from www.heathershair.co.uk. Arrived within 2 days!! These weaves are an alternative to wigs as I\u2019m not sure how I will get on with one. The weaves are sewn on to soft headbands and the idea is to go under a hat with some hair showing. They do need a little trim when they arrive BUT.... these are totally FREE!!! You pay p&p and they will ask for a donation which is completely up to you. All done by volunteers. I am very pleased so far.",

      "Content": "Thought this chemo was a piece of cake! How wrong am I??? I have got up this morning and just feel awful. I really can\u2019t explain how I feel, no energy, my mouth and tongue feel strange, I\u2019m crying and just now realise this is what I\u2019ve got for the next few months. I have been so positive since diagnosis, I suppose as I didn\u2019t feel ill it has all been a bit surreal until today! Now I just want it all to go away and wonder if I\u2019m going to get through this with my sanity still in place. I know there are people a LOT worse off than me , and much braver, so I\u2019m sorry for whinging",
