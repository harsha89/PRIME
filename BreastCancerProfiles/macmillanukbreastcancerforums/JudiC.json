      "Content": "Hi, so sorry you're feeling so down, it is so early for you that its not surprising you're feeling so down. Don't forget that general anaesthetics alone can make you feel very low and yours was only 4 days ago. Most of us on here are a bit further along the road and while we have all had our VERY low times, we are also getting times when we are feeling positive, mainly due to reading all the 'good news' posts on here. try to think of all the positives you've got already - WLE rather than Mx, SNB rather than having an axillary clearance or removal of lots of sample lymph nodes. Fingers crossed for a good path report from the SNB. Grade 1 is brilliant - celebrate! ER/PR+ve is brilliant - Tamoxifen may get some bad press BUT its a miracle drug offering really good outcomes for ER=Ve cancers, as are the AI drugs for this type of cancer too. Hopefully in a little while we'll see you on here offering positive thoughts to other newly diagnosed women,but in the mean time - don't beat yourself up. You're allowed to be down at the moment but you are surrounded by love and positive thoughts on this site. Big hugs xxx",

From mild redness thoughout the treatment, which finished on 20th Sept, I am now 1 week after first chemo and it is hot, red, very soar and twice as bad as it ever was while having the treatment. Having it at different hospitals and the BCN where I'm getting chemo said she wasn't familiar with radiation reactions. BCN at R/T unit just advised same skin care as before and rather seemed to dismiss me as I'd finished with their care. Has anyone else had this? Any suggestions?",

Neutropenic means your white blood cells are low, this is checked before each chemo and is often prevented by an injection given at home 24 hrs after each chemo round, in your tummy fat. Can do this yourself, or get a loved one involved, my daughter does mine, or a district nurse will call in. mets is short for Metasteses, secondary cancer that we are all hoping to avoid, but if they do come are usually in the bones or liver following breast primary.

The oncologist took me off the tamoxifen and I'm having TC + herceptin, finishing TC next month but then Herceptin for a year. I'm now worrying reading on here about women still on Tamoxifen while on their Herceptin. Whats the general thought? Are many of you on both or has anyone been told to stop the Tamoxifen? I can't get the image of the Oestrogen receptors all running wild, feeding the cancer, without the Tamoxifen blocking them. The chemo nurses are great but all have to toe the party line, ie agree with what the onc says! All thoughts gratefully received! Judi",

Its such a bright spot at the end of chemo, that any delay now just feels so much worse than any other time of the year. I'm there with you with all your side effects - wondered why my nose was sore, I hadn't thought of loosing nose hair until you mentioned it! My nose is also bleeding, which I was a bit worried about but obvious when you think about it! Tax after Rads is the pits. My onc called it 'Recall radiation effect' which I googled and apparently your body sort of reactivates the radiation skin damage as a response to chemo, again something I hadn't been warned to expect when I finished Rads, but a relief to hear. I though the cancer was back in some horrid inflammatory way! So feel free to have a good winge, your husband loves you (mine commented this morning that 'not many women get to see the shape of their heads'!!) and we WILL be finished by Christmas.

The pain over my scar gets worse every day, my ribs feel bruised and that seems to be spreading round my back. In my worst moments I'm convinced its rib metasteses, (despite being lymph node negative and  clear margins). My breast is still sore and red. I mentioned all this at my last check up a month ago and was dismissed, and he even said 'it may get worse before it gets better'. Is this true? Does everyone have this much pain? Though I know I was fortunate, I now keep wishing I'd had a Mx. Sorry for the rant, I just want to get on with my life and forget the last 6 months, (even got 3 mm of new hair growth!) but when I can't even lie on my right side, I just can't. ",

I'm not starting R/T for another month or so, only just had surgery, but having worked as a radiographer for 30 years I would like to tell anyone in the UK, that therapy radiographers ('technicians') should all be compassionate and understanding. These qualities are as essentail as the technical and scientific expertise that they have.There are specially trained MacMillan radiographers in many units who should be there to offer support as well as speaking to the lead radiographer. PALS, BCN etc. No-one should have to suffer this indignity and lack of care.

I'm wearing two hats as I work in education and training for the NHS Breast Screening Programme and my current other hat is a natty beany covering my Taxotere thinned and patchy head! Some researchers, specifically Scandinavian but also from the UK, are very anti screening and feel all the money should go into research and treatment but.. 1300 lives a year are saved by screening. Until such a time as we can identify which DCIS will progress and which won't, then the decision for treatment MUST remain with us, the women affected. Hopefully this final, independent report will lead to greater information for women to make their own decisions, but crucially will stop the anti screening campaigners from gaining more publicity. The main danger is if anyone refuses treatment when treatment is their best bet due to misinformation and misinterpretation of the report.

They also say that there is no point in my daughters having early screening, (they're currently 20 and 22) but should have yearly screening from age 50, (hope I'm around to remind them!!). Both my sister's and my cancers were 'true intervals'. ie not seen at routine screening but then presented 1 year later. Mum's was before screening was offered so we don't know but expect that was the same. Its interesting to see the differences in treatment over the years - Gt Grandma had a Radical Mastectomy told to stuff her bra with a sock and died within 2 years. Mum had a modified mastectomy and an external silicone prosthesis. She survived 5 years before getting bone and liver secondries. My sister had a Mx with TRAM flap reconstruction and is alive and well. I had an additional screening at 18 months so was picked up earlier and have just had WLE and clear lymph nodes - start R/T on Monday.

Screening mammography will detect tiny DCIS, many of which may never go on to become full blown invasive cancers, but some of which will. There is currently no way of knowing which. Before screening was widely available, these pre invasive cancers were never seen. Only those that became invasive and thus had 'signs and symptoms' - lumps, dimples, skin puckering etc were investigated. Do we really want to go back to this? My cancer was seen at screening at 3mm of invasive, with 2 cmsof DCIS around it, I was thankfully lymph node free but my cancer was also HER2+ve and thus I am going through chemo and Herceptin. If I hadn't been screened with no symptoms, my cancer would have grown rapidly and my prognosis would have been worse. If I had been screened a few months earlier, it would have still been DCIS and an even better future outcome than the one I thankfully have. We have the information, we can choose.  Choice 1 - don't go for screening, take your chances Choice 2 - if diagnosed with DCIS at screening, accept treatment OR DON'T - wait and see if it becomes invasive. Its not a political issue, the choices are there for us, thank goodness! SIMPLES!",

      "Content": "Will do Joy, do you get the tummy injection 24 hours after chemo to stop the neutropenia, the one that makes your bones feel like they've been run over with a steam roller!!? It seems to work as my white count has stayed good throughout.  I take your point about hydrocortisone also being a steroid, but worth a try. Lieing in bed at the moment feeling like I could roast chestnuts on my face, very seasonal(!), so worth a try for next round. Goodluck for Dec 5th xx",

      "Content": "Firstly, well done on having DCIS picked up before any invasive disease (IDC), though that must have been such a shock to have it in lots of places and needing a mastectomy. The best person to ask about the fold in your LD flap reconstruction would be the Breast Care Nurse who works most closely with the surgeon who did your op. Did you get given a contact number for her? If not, why not call the help line here and ask one of the help line nurses?",
