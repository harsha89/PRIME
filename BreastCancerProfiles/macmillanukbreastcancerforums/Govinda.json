      "Content": "Yes! I agree with you. I get cravings for all sorts of weird things and just eat what my body obviously wants. Like salty things, crackers, olives, Ribena juice, tomatoes and yeah, icecream+++ Pork pies too! I figure eating ANYTHING is more important than nothing, especially with the weight loss factor involved. Listening to the body helps all round.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm about to start weekly Taxol for 12 weeks following my four gastly A/C chemo sessions. I'm curious to find out from those with the voice of experience, how it went for them? In particluar the side effects? I have been told no more nausea - true? What about taste? I have also been told the tiredness will be more due to the weekly visits than the drug - true? Plus I've heard joint pain, nail ridges/flaking and the usual risk of infection are part of the course. Cheers.",

      "Content": "Hi Jen, Just trying to understand your post. You have had a mastectony with no node spread, decided no chemo (don't blame you, it sucks) but this is your second time having cancer, is that right? What I really want to know is about your first cancer, breast? node spread? Type of chemo you endured? I have just finished my four A/C chemo treatments and start the weekly Taxol on the 9th. If my cnacer comes back in years to come they can operate and take out what they want from where they want but I won't be going back for chemo the next time around. Cheers.",
