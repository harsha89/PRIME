      "Content": "Really helpful as i already have to deal with atrial fibulation. I will print out your reply when i go for any consultations. Some concerns as i have found out that there is not a cardiologist on the group that dicussies my care plan and when i suggested a cardio oncologist to the nurse they seemed to not have met the idea. I will certainly bring these concerns up with the consultant but at the moment waiting for path results from surgery. Many thanks.",
