      "Content": "Hiya. I had my right breast off 2 1/2 weeks ago in my mastectomy. I'm only 37, so young to lose a breast. Your breasts represent femininity and having one off seems daunting. But I'm amazed how nice and neat it all is. The stitches are inside, gone are the days of awful stitch scars. The false boobs are great these days, such a choice, and bras, swimwear, also lots of choice!! I was thankful my cancer was in a body part they could remove (as opposed to middle of my brain etc). Lots and lots of women go through this, take comfort in the fact you are not alone. Good luck xxx",
