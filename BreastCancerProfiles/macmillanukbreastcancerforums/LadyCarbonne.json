    "Content": "Hi Ed my herceptin treatment was stopped after 4 sessions as my heart dropped to 40 it got back to 55 in 3 months but after 1 session dropped back to 45. It's as mistymoley says checks and balances I've had no herceptin since February but had regular echos and ct scans to monitor everything. I trust my team and they have trained for years so they know what they are talking about.  Stick with it and go with the flow. Easier said than done at times. ",
