      "Content": "Hi The three books ive read and were recommended by a friend who had prostrate cancer and had researched extensively were the Rainbow Diet by Chris Woolams and Your life in your hands by Professor Janet Plant, I also have the Plant Programme by Janet Planet which is full of healthy eating recipes.  In both it says about eating lots of colourful vegetables and fruit, also the nourish book by Penny Brohn is very good and was recommended by my oncology sister at the chemotherapy day centre. Remember its a personal choice but eating healthy does help with some of the side effects,  Tesco do a wide range of dairy free milk, butter, cheese, yoghurt, milkshakes, I still have porridge , cereals, custard, but use soya or almond milk and use pureed friut or honey to sweeten things, at Christmas i even made a Christmas cake and pudding that was dairy and sugar free, made some chocolate and beetroot brownies yesterday using dairyfree chocolate and dates to sweeten it instead of sugar having it with dairyfree ice cream as not been able to eat after last lot of chemo, and wondered if it would stimulate my appitite, as used to have such a sweet tooth before being diagnosed, soya does have levels of phytoestrogen that mimic the action of the bodys own oestrogen so limit how much you eat of it. Hope this is of some interest but its a personal choice. Xxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi There's a lot of writing about eating dairy, about oestrogen and growth hormones in our meats and also sugar feeding cancer cells.  I have given up milk and cheese and have almond or soya products instead and feel alot less bloated after meals. But I do still have a treat when out for a meal which I enjoy and if you fancy something then eat it in moderation. I mentioned about no dairy to my oncology sister who said it was a change for life, she recommended the book nourish, the cancer care cookbook which is full of tasty receipes from chocolate brownies to smoothies and stir-frys.It rrecommends eating plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit and tells you the nutritional value for each meal i am making a turkey korma with spinach and pistachios and spiced flatheads tonight for dinner, one of the receipes in the cookbook.

      "Content": "Hi I'm had my mastectomy 31st October and started chemotherapy on the 11th December, suffered with indigestion and heartburn from the first chemo, just completed 4th out of 6. I mentioned it to my chemotherapy nurse and they prescribed 20th omeprazole which I take once a day and has helped so much. She did say you will need to take it for the duration of the chemotherapy. I've just had my first docetaxol and I am suffering with pains in back,legs, pelvis in fact most joints!!  You're doing well 2/3 of the way through only 2 more to go. Xxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi i finished 6 sessions of chemo the end of March,  at the time it seemed to go so slowly inbetween each treatment, first week you feel awful, second week okay, third week nearly normal, not able to sleep the night before as knowing what was to come, but looking back it did go quickly, despite being hospitalised three times, twice for infection and once when the chemo leaked into the surrounding tissue of my hand and burnt it and caused an infection in it!!! Look at it as one less treatment to go, drink plenty of water when you have the chemo and try to get fresh air, even if its wrapped up in a blanket sitting on a chair in the garden like I did!! It's amazing how quickly your body starts to recover after its finished and you will get through this. I also started knitting as it seemed to take my mind off the sickness following the pattern, on good days go for a short walk to stop any muscle wastage in your legs and enjoy the fresh air, for the constipation I took the senna tablets but also got a stronger laxative from the hospital aswell and found eating soups with plenty of vegetables in it helped as couldn't eat solids. You will get through this and there is light at the end of tunnel, each time you complete a treatment it brings you closer to end of that tunnel, I wish you all well for the rest of your treatment and hope everything goes well, sending you all a big hug xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Bjez Sorry to hear your having a rough time, I too suffered with terrible sore throatso after each cycle of FEC-T. It started with the 2nd cycle and got worse. I also had difflam and an aniseed gel which didn't really do anything so I was prescribed antibiotics after each chemo from the oncology department.This helped so much. Once the chemo finished my throat was okay. Take care  Sending you a big hug  xxxxxxx ",
