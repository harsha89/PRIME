    "Content": "Have just had 3rd dose of Docetaxel and have just realised dose I have been given last two times seem very high compared to advised dose on web sites of up to 100mg.  My first dose was even higher (145mg) but had bad reaction so reduced by 20% to 115mg, but as I said now having checked dose still seems higher than recommended.  Can anyone else advise whether this is a standard dose and they have been given this too? Feeling quite worried now but nothing I can do as have just received it today.  Any advice appreciated.  By the way first three doses were FEC.",
