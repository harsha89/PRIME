When i went for results afterwards to be told you are cancer free it's a great day.  Now I've just started tamoxifen and waiting to go to radiotherapy. Take one day at a time x",

Called in for results on 22nd, another examination and boobs measured from all angles. Results weren't the news i was hoping as saw something on left as well. Back for contrast enhanced mammogram on 3rd Jan as Xmas slowed it down, and left boob was fine but i have it in right boob. Had my pre op 4th and now gotta see surgeon on 12th to see if his 'provisional' surgery he has booked will go ahead. I hope you get good news. The waiting is hard. Don't google as hard as that is or stick to English Cancer groups. My BCN told me to steer clear of American sites. It has gone quickly so hang in there xx",
