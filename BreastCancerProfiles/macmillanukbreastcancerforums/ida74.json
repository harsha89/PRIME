    "Content": "Hi Sara, I\u2019m was diagnosed with occult breast cancer in 2014. I had an axillary clearance on my left side. I went through all the treatments, radiation and chemotherapy. It\u2019s 4 years since my cancer was diagnosed and I have a check up every year. It was scary and I empathise with what your experiencing right now. I was 46 when diagnosed. I\u2019ve come through the experience and was totally lost with diagnosis thinking it must be somewhere else in my body. I had the usual MRI and was dreading the worst, luckily it was occult breast cancer and no trace anywhere else. I had a further MRI last year and the radiologist found a suspicious mass. The first biopsy was negative and the radiologist wasn\u2019t satisfied so a further biopsy was carried out, nightmare wait, but luckily it wasn\u2019t cancer. The only advise I can give is to have as much sleep as possible. Have whatever you fancy to eat, it my case malteesers and Greggs sausage rolls were my food craving during chemotherapy. After the initial stages of chemotherapy I ate much healthier options, lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, oh and green tea. I did go through a very severe menopause which was grim. I\u2019m now through it all now and looking ahead. I hope your through your chemotherapy now as your post was January 2018. Stay strong and remember you will come through this experience a stronger person. Thinking of you Ida (GS)",
