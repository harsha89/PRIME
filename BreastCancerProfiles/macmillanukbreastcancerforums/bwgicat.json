    "Content": "I'm really sorry for your loss and can perfectly understand your need for answers. I had a huge lump which was very prominent by the time I had my biopsy but suffered no pain. However, I was told that a tiny lump can be far more aggressive but not having pain is usually a bad sign (i.e. it's cancer), my lump may have been huge but this was only because it was closer to the surface and not hidden, a good thing I'm told.. One thing I've learnt is that it seems almost impossible to second guess cancer or even recognise the signs, I've spoken to so many people all with breast cancer and having radicals and we all have different stories, different symptoms and different treatments. I'm sorry if I'm not being very helpful but if you're worried that your mum has been suffering in silence and ignoring the symptoms then the chances are that she didn't, sometimes it can be very hard to spot and maybe she knew nothing until the diagnosis. I really didn't even consider cancer until I got the actual diagnosis despite the lump, biopsy and mammogram, i wasn't in denial I just knew that 80% of lumps are non cancerous and decided not to worry until I had something to worry about. I'm sure your mum could have been the same. Sorry for the cliches but take one day at a time, it will get better and if you didn't love her so much then you wouldn't hurt so much, and it's that love that'll get you through. Good luck Angi",
