      "Content": "Hi Ansi - came across your old blog while researching Letrozole and anxiety and noted that (at the time) you were off on a four hour trip to Devon which, before being prescribed Citalopram, would have put you in a tailspin. That's me to a T! All day, every day. Anxiety, sometimes shakiness and more skipped heartbeats than I can count (though fewer than 50, I'd say). I've been on Letrozole for 3 years but whilst on it, was diagnosed with another small bc in the opposite breast where I'd had DCIS in 1999 (so 3 bc diagnoses in 15 years up till 2015 though all small, non-aggressive, and no lymph node spread). Have had 2 mx, 2 lots of radiation and Letrozole. I was prescribed Paxil for anxiety but decided not to go ahead due to awful reviews re coming off it. If you're still on Citalopram, how have you found it? I sometimes feel so down with the anxiety that I cannot function - everything is too overwhelming. Does anyone else suffer from skipped heartbeats with their anxiety, due to Letrozole? I do hope you're well now and that you are able to shed some light for me. Xo ",

      "Content": "Hi Whathappened - thanks for your input. I've had a resting ECG done (no palps at the time) + blood tests (thyroid, iron etc.) and all was fine. These palps are purely one-off skips, up to 6 or maybe a few more, per hour. My pulse otherwise is quite regular. I've read a lot about ectopics (skipped beats) and apparently unless they're accompanied by breatlessness, nausea, dizziness and/or sweating, they're usually nothing to worry about. I've seen my gp twice since they first started and he still thinks they're caused by anxiety (and he's a pretty thorough doctor). My husband has had afib and I know his pulse at the time was totally erratic, not regular with the odd skipped beat, so I'm pretty sure on that one, but nevertheless, they're off-putting when they do happen. I've also read that Letrozole can cause non-life-threatening heart problems so I'm thinking maybe this is what it is. But I'll definitely go back to my gp if they don't settle.",

      "Content": "Hi NJ, thanks for your post. I'm doing well, getting the odd skipped beat but mostly after meals. I can walk our dog at a fairly brisk pace with no problem but anxiety definitely exacerbates it at times. My husband has had afib and I know exactly how his pulse felt then - totally out of sync (mine isn't like that). It's definitely a lot better than previously I'm pleased to say. Take care!",

      "Content": "Hi Kismet1, I realise your post is old, but wondered how things are going for you now. I too suffer from palpitations (mostly 'skipped' heartbeats) and have been on Letrozole (Femara) for about 5 years (need to be on it an extra 2 years as I had a third bc, opp side, 2 years after my second...first was 1999, DCIS, only radiotherapy, no meds for that one). For about 18 months I've been getting the skipped beats, and sometimes short runs of faster beats including the skipped ones, and am very aware of my heartbeat generally. Have had 2 ECGs (one showing skipped beat), and thorough stethoscoping and been told my heart is fine. When I'm busy I don't seem to have it as much...or don't notice it. I've been told it's linked to anxiety, which I've suffered on and off for years and it's definitely worse on these meds - I'm finding even the thought of going on holidays can fill me with anxiety! Have posted before and have been told these can be  s/e's, though not common, of Aromatase Inhibitors, though most aren't warned when they begin taking them. I can't wait to come off Letrozole in 2 years' time - I can't remember what it's like to be 'me'!",
