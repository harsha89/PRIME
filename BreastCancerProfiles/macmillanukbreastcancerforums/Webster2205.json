    "Content": "I hope I can be of some kind of help to a lot of you out there. I was diagnosed march 2012. First ever mammogram (before I was 50) luckily. Routine. Just got called up early (I was 50 in May) 2012. I've had other medical problems and a liver scare the year before which were nothing. Nothing could prepare me for the year ahead. I'm a positive person and a half full not empty person. After call back I was told. I had two areas that were cancer. The word rang through my head and I asked am I going to die. Nurse piped up not from this - but you will one day!!! I cried constantly for 3 weeks every single day without fail. I wad booked for surgery in March and told that a wle for both areas was possible. Then radiotherapy. Ok. I'd come to terms with it. When biopsies back the stages were worse and told the Oncology appt was made. He was lovely. Told me as I was young ( yeah right) chemo would be my best chance of cure. Cure was the ultimate word. He told me I'd have to have my long locks cut and chemo wasn't great. I cried again as everything went in two week cycles. He looked at me and 'you are going to be alright'. I clung to that. So having been told chemo would start on my 50 th birthday, he postponed to the following week. Surgery had gone really well. Sore and 4 lymph nodes removed as 1 a bit dodgy I recovered physically well I had 5 x FEC used cold cap after having my hair cut off but unfortunately after 2nd FEC day 16 my hair went. I managed to keep a fringe and a back bit (like a monk),,!!! Had load of scarves false eyelashes and some weird eyebrows for a while which now makes me laugh. 5 FEC as I couldn't have last one as too Ill. 3 blood transfusions n several stays in the wonderful marsden sutton and most time in bed. Ok so then rads was a walk in park for 25 sessions u do cook after this but creams potions and dressings good. So that sounds like hell right. Here I am 1 year after rads finished back at my normal job being my normal self have had one year mammogram which all ok and my hair is shoulder length and I look normal. 5 year tamoxifen job done. Now this is the person who sobbed saying I can't do this. You ruddy can. Believe in the professionals. Go with the flow. Cry like a baby. Think you look ugly. Take help when people offer. Don't be proud. I had fantastic support around me but chose to be quite private. You ca n do this really u can. I don't post a lot but have a couple of special people i have met along the way that I still see. I just wanted to say when u are at your lowest look at the positive posts. They really helped me along the way x",
