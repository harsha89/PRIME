After years of fighting to be tested for the brca1 and brca2 gene, and only being tested once I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August, I today got the results and I haven't got the gene!! Some good news for a change!! Still going through chemo at the moment, with rads and maybe full lymph node removal to follow once chemo is finished, but at least this is one less thing I have to worry about! I cried with happiness when I got the call. Â Now I'm off to try my wig on as most of my hair has fallen out today, but I'm still happy :-)",

Not sure how I feel, it's weird! No more appointments, no one mauling me until my next mammogram, no more pills and injections! Just been on a spending spree courtesy of Mr MasterCard, I'll worry about how to pay it off later! Lol! And booked a short break in Poland, the same break I had to cancel when I got diagnosed. Big sunshine holiday next year once my hair has grown back and I can lose the wig :-) Been through a lot but it wasn't half as bad as I was expecting, especially the chemo. So for any of you recently diagnosed, hang on in there, it's doable and time flies by! And good luck to all xxx",

My nipple is like a pontefract cake after the radiotherapy but it's all good :-) Nefertiti I started Tamoxifen a few weeks before my radiotherapy, I don't think it made any difference to be honest. Radiotherapy was a breeze, just very tiring and the skin under my boob where my bra seam is went tender and started peeling but they gave me some fab spongy dressings to put under so my bra didn't rub. Just remember to moisturise the area 3 times a day. I had to get some cream for my nipple as it was itchy as hell, and as every woman knows it's not easy to scratch your nipple! Lol xx",
