      "Content": "Thank you. I hardly slept last night and I think I have been pushing everything to one side and now I have to deal with it. I'm so worried eveything is going to change. My daughter is nearly 1 and I'm so worried I won't be able to look after her as I do now. I hate the not knowing about what they are going to do after the chemo. Hoping I will feel better after I know what I'm facing. I know what you mean about the Euros but at least I can say I'm going to bed earlier with no questions asked!! When do you start chemo Mary? Xx",

      "Content": "Hello, I was told 3 weeks ago that I had cancer :( I had found a lump in my armpit and got referred by my doctor to be checked as my mum had breast cancer last year. They \"think\" its breast cancer as the lymph node they biopsed had cancer cells which had qualities of breast or ovarian cancer. Iv had an ultrasound, mammogram, bone scan and CT scan and they couldnt see anything. They sent me to a different hospital for an MRI and then had to go back for another ultrasound and a biopsy on the areas that looked \"different\". I dont get the results until wednesday but they are starting chemo tomorrow as it has already spread to lymph nodes. Has anyone else been in this situation? I feel like im fighting something but I have no idea where it has come from :( xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you for all your wise words. It's such a minefield! I hadn't look at it from the removing a good thing point of view. My main concern is my daughter as silly as it sounds, she is nearly 1 so has no idea what's going on ( which is lovely and such a distraction) My mum was diagnosed with BC in 2010 and it crushed me, prob worse than it is facing it myself. I don't want my daughter feeling like that and I think that is why I want to do anything to prevent that. Probably sounds silly as its my body which will be changing dramatically. I think I have alot to think about and am going to write it down to talk to the doctor and see what he thinks. I have been told it is hormone positive in my breast but not my lymph nodes. But as there are 3 areas in my breast they seem to saying masectomy is the way to go. My head is buzzing but wanted thank you all for your wise words and support. Big virtual hugs to you all MistyT xxx",

      "Content": "Hello All I had my first lot of chemo yesterday and it was confirmed by the breast care nurse that I do have breast cancer. Not something you would think I would be happy about but I was so worried about it hiding as they had to do an MRI to spot it. Only found out due to it spreading to my lymph nodes. Feeling tired today but I have been able to nap as my mum came and picked my daughter up after lunch. I haven't spoke to my doctor about the next step after my chemo yet. I have an appointment on 27th to discuss everything with him. But the breast care nurse told me they were thinking a mastectomy. I want to ask doctor about the pros n cons of having a double mastectomy as I'm 25 and I'm worried I may have to go through this again. I know that doesn't mean it wouldn't come back elsewhere or in any tissue that they couldn't remove but I suppose I'm just trying to think my options through. Did anyone have a double mastectomy even though only one breast was affected? Or does anyone have some words of wisdom for me? Thanks xxx",
