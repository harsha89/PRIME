Like you, I have had a lumpectomy with clear margins and one clear node removed. After four sessions of radiotherapy my nipple and surrounding area is red today. Like your mum I am almost 71, so hearing about her survival cheered me up. Have a wonderful day! Cecilia xxx",

Have you asked Macmillan Support for financial advice? Also, can you get a second opinion on your treatment? My heart goes out to you and your husband. Hugs xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Kim, I think it is diabolical that you should have to make that choice. What treatment did you have for endometrial cancer? I am 70 and have had a lumpectomy with clear margins and one node removed which was also clear. I am undergoing radiotherapy just now and have been taking Tamoxifen for four weeks. My quandary is whether I should continue taking T after reading that it could lead to endometrial cancer. The \"Predict\" chart seemed to indicate that it does not make a significant difference to my survival rate,so is it worth the risk? I am in the Glasgow region. Are there any other oldies out there who would like to compare notes? Ceely.x",

      "Content": "Hello JWI, reading your letter made me very sad. Perhaps by taking so little time off work you have made light of the treatment. This young man is selfish and ignorant and makes me worry that in my youth I may have behaved thoughtlessly (I'm 71). Your line manager should try to make him understand your difficulties. On the other hand, Try to ignore his comments and make use of any trolleys etc. Lots of people in the workplace are unable to do heavy lifting. Â If your boss knows and is okay with it there is no problem. A good rant is good for us now and then. Take care x",
