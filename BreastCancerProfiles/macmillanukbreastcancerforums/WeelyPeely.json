    "Content": "Just found this website and been reduced to tears reading my story from other people ( I have been that Duracell bunny). I was dreading the Taxotere after 3 doses of FEC and had to have a central line inserted to have it administered as the FEC had hardened my veins. I wear iced gloves during administration to try to reduce nail damage - same principle as the cold cap. I have also painted my nails dark and wear gloves when outside. My fingers feel as though someone is squeezing them with pliers but my nails are still there just not growing very much and easy to break. It was lovely not to feel sick with taxotere after the FEC experience but the diarrheoa was bad but controllable with codeine phosphate - immodium did nothing! Make sure you report back on your side effects as my second dose was reduced which made it much easier to cope with. There was a fellow patient in the unit who had lost one or two nails but they had come off slowly and there was a new nail underneath so you're not left with bare finger ends. I was dreading the joint pains but they have been pretty mild and no worse than being achy after exercise - I still walk every day and this helps with the fatigue. Keep in mind - it's just medicine to make you better and all side effects can be managed. My hair is growing back - it feels like fuzzy felt! Hope all goes well - I have my last of 3 next week.
