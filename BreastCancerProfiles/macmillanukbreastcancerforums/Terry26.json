    "Content": "Highland Mum My Dad was diagnosed with Grade 4 NSCLC prognosis 4 months! He was not going to take that info lying down! So he volunteered for clinical trials and that also meant chemo etc. Nobody ever says that chemo is a walk in the park but luckily with all the relevant anti sickness drugs and support from his Mac nurse he managed it very well. Over the next 29 months he had several holidays abroad, went back to playing golf! I thank my lucky stars that we had a great oncologist, a bloody determined Dad and great support from his lung cancer team. We had extra Christmases, 21st Birthdays, grandchildren accepted into Uni and lots of other things that he was able to experience with us. The NHS really worked for us and the conventional treatment did too. We followed lots of other alternative therapies as well, diet, exercise etc so hand in hand they were. I hope your treatment goes as smoothly as possible, my dear friend who had exactly the same treatment you are about to embark is riding around on her horse as I type this, 11 years down the line and as fit and happy as ever!! Terry xx",
