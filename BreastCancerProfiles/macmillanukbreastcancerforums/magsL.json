    "Content": "Hi Wendy I had my op in February this year, during my radiotherapy I saw my oncologist who explained and showed me on her computer how she worked out radiotherapy treatment explaining clips were placed and left in so she could work out the area treatment was to cover ie how far lymph nodes were removed etc ensuringÂ that the appropriate area is treated hope this makes sense and helps. Best Wishes MagsL",
