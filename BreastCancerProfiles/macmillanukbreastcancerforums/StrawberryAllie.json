    "Content": "Hi, I start my chemo w/c 7th July and I am going to give the cold cap a try.  I am having the Paxman(?) system and I have been told that it has a 70% success rate.  My oncologist recommended I try it, so I thought I would give it a go, if it doesn't work or I cannot tolerate it then I will stop, but I want to give it a go. Good luck! Allison",
