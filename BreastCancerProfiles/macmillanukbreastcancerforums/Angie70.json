      "Content": "Hi fellow chemo warriors Yesterday I had my third FEC - given new anti-sickness drug Emend after very bad vomiting last time.    Much better this time - not been sick (yet) but feeling a bit queasy.    One new development is that I am retaining fluid - drinking lots as recommended but not peeing much - I have put on nearly 6 pounds overnight.   Fluid is listed as a possible side effect for Tax but not the FEC.    Maybe its the Emend or just me?    Has anyone else had this? Thanks ",

      "Content": "Thanks Kate Maybe it is just me - it has now eased and I am peeing fairly normally but my worry is that the wretched stuff wasn't being flushed through my system.     Now on day three still feeling queasy but no vomiting this time thank goodness.    Guess I will have to mention it to the doctor at next pre-chemo appointment and probably get even more pills to take!",

      "Content": "Hi Elena I was the same as you after first FEC - it does pass - try and eat little and often and drink lots - I found eating actually helped, although had to force the food down.   Listen to what your body fancies - I could only face toast and marmite at first.   Ginger biscuits also highly recommended.    I don't want to worry you but I was much worse on second FEC - then given Emend anti-sickness drug - ask for this for next time - I don't think they give it unless you ask.   It has made a real difference for third FEC - still mild nausea in the morning for three days but very manageable.    You are not being a wuss - the first treatment is horrible - not knowing what to expect and worrying about the months ahead - its a rocky road but one we seem to find the strength to go down. ",

      "Content": "Hi fellow chemo warriors Had first TAX last week after 4 FEC - different side effects - at least I havent had the sickness and nausea this time.   Still feel completely wiped out but my main problem (at the moment!) is that my mouth is really sore and I am struggling to eat.  My usual chemo diet has been savoury stuff but this is now making the mouth worse.   Have substituted toast and marmite for bread and jam and bland soup is going down OK.   I don't have a sweet tooth anyway and from day one of first FEC I haven't been able to face anything remotely milky so dairy products are out.  This is not a good to lose weight!!!     Any experiences of acceptable foods during this phase would be greatly appreciated.   Also, what have chemo ladies used to help with the mouth soreness - no ulcers yet.    Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Mel Also home alone and coping with start of hair loss - first chemo 5th August.   Haven't cried yet and trying to be positive but I'm sure it will hit me soon.   My hair is my best feature so its a big thing for me.   I can't face having it shaved - but mine isn't coming out in clumps yet just a steady flow of stray hairs.   However I have asked my sister to bring her hairdressing scissors when I see her at the weekend.    There are some really nice hats and turbans around and I have also bought a false fringe which looks quite good with my new turban.    I have a really good wig - very near my colour and style and it won't go grey!!    So looking on the bright side I will save a fortune on hairdressing bills.   Can always go for the Joan Collins look if need to look glamorous (ha ha!!!).    As you say another step in this awful journey - stay strong but cry when you need to.
