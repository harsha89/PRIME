    "Content": "When i was told i had a tumour i new deep down it was cancerous even though my gynecolgist thought it was ia fibroid. Anyway i told him to remove the uterus in tack so if it was cancer i was doing everything possible to stop it spreading. When the results came in my consultant was floored because not only was it cancerous but a rare form that doesnt react to treatment. All they could do was remove ovaries as it is hormone senstive. Now i have to be scanned every 6 mths. The reason i tell you this, is i was totally on my own dealing with this so rather than let it drag me down and have my head go into overdrive i threw myself into work and anything else that would block my thoughts. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, i give my number to others whom also had cancer and helping them let it be with benefit forms or simply talking and listening also helped me cope and deal with what i was going through. I still have to deal with 6 monthly scans the last 5 yrs but helping others make me cope. If you want to chat on phone that is ok Imelda",
