      "Content": "Hi, I'm very sorry to hear that your wife also has issues from her LD flap.  Mine was done 17 years ago but I was not given any knowledge about how this it would affect my back. My brilliant chiropractor has been helping me understand its significance and is also slowly releasing the scar tissue.  With hindsight I wish I had known so I could've addressed it sooner rather than as a result of a separate incident.   I'm happy to share more info if it would help in any way.  Linda",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, I do hope you are healing well and most importantly that your recovery is the beginning of a new journey.  With an early awareness of how your back may possibly be weakened, I feel sure that finding a specialist physio/chiropractor who fully understands the biomechanics of an LD flap would optimise any impact.  I chose this particular surgery because I felt it would help on an emotional and practical level as I was very active.  At the time it did just that.  Our extraordinary bodies can and will adapt especially if they are given the correct and timely support they need.  Hope this helps, Linda",

      "Content": "Hello Lucy, I am new to this site and online forums but I went through all this 17 years ago.  I too got a really quick appointment which which totally freaked me but was also a comfort in that I was being looked after and taken seriously and had less time to speculate.  The waiting part is the toughest so do try to keep your mind distracted.  A friend made notes for me which was also really helpful as my mind went blank at the time.  Will be thinking of you, Linda",
