    "Content": "Hi everyone I am new to this group just wanted some advise or someone to say this is normal, Was diagnosed with breast cancer last year had chemo which I was sick all the way through had six sessions in all, had 15 sessions of radiontherapy which finished just before christmas which left me feeling sick and  very tired.  Even though all my treatments are finished I feel so exhusted sometimes I find it hard to even walk up the stairs, just sitting down dosent help I am trying to  do daily tasks like hoovering washing that type of thing but you know sometimes just listening to the telly wheres me out, I then get frustrated with myself then I get vey down I remember feeling like this with my chemo a little, however its worse now then before its hard to focus on things, I am sure my family think I should be back to normal now, for example my sister said you have finished all your treatments you should be back to normal soon. I feel like I am letting my family down and my husband has stood by me the whole way through I dont think I can tell him I feel so tired all the time even though he knows something is wrong. Does anyone have any advise please. Thank you",
