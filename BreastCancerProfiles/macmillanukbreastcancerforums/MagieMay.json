    "Content": "I had a masectomy and immediate extended lat dorssi breast reconstruction last year. All seemed fine at the time, but after 4 weeks started experiencing backache on walking and \"nerve\" pain in my back, together with muscle spasms in my reconstructed breast. A year on and I've exausted the range of nerve mediceines, I have really bad side effects, After first lot of Botox treatment I said I'd never have it done again (for muscle spasms) but the pain consultant said it was best way forward, so 4 weeks ago, 2nd botox injection. By end of week 1 I had not known such pain and now after 4 weeks can raise my arm above my head, but not straighten it my reconstruction is so uncomfortable that I am thinking of asking them to remove it, it pulls right from near my shoulder blade on my back. Has anyone out there had any similar problems. The consultant does not want to cut the nerve. My back feels like someone has cut a lump out of it ( which they have) and taken too much so it feels tight all the time. I have done all their exercises, gone swimming wtc but nothing helps.",
