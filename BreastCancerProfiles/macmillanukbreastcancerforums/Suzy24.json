      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply - it is the waiting and not knowing what we are dealing with that is the worst - its strange because they dont know where the primary cancer is because apart from these strange lymph nodes around her body everything else looked ok unless it is a new cancer - that would be very bad luck - 3 different cancers in 5 years !! Whats so upsetting is her prognosis was so good both times being caught so early - its such a shock !! I really appreciate your kind works and I will give the helpline a call thanks Suzy xx",

      "Content": "I am new here and could really do with some info and support for my poor Mum, she is 69 years old and 5 years ago was diagnosed with Uterine Cancer (MMMT) she had a full hysterectomy, lymph node removal and cervix removed, lymph nodes were clear and she was staged at Stage 1 so no further treatment needed however she had to have a hernia repair as her bowel was protruding through the muscle wall. Then 2 years later a routine mammogram detected a lump which turned out to be breast cancer she had a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy and has been on a hormone drug since ( like tamoxifen but different name) her lymph nodes were tested and where clear so again she was very lucky and was stage 1 again  - we really thought she had been lucky but she hadnt had an mri scan for a couple of years so had one 2 weeks ago  but only of her pelvic area ( she is under different consultants for both cancers) the mri showed some enlarged lymph nodes in her pelvis one was pressing on an artery and could cause blood clot so she has been injecting daily. They ordered a full CT scan which she had on monday and today has been told that they have found other enlarged lymph nodes in different parts of her body - one is on her shoulder/neck and they want to take a biopsy and I believe there are others, her major organs looked ok and they was no large mass  or tumour seen, obviously we are devastated - how can she have been stage 1 both times and it keep coming back - is this really bad news or is there something that can be done  for her ? We are all beside ourselves, we are such a close family and at christmas time too - :( Any advice gratefully received thank you xx",
