      "Content": "Hi I was the same. Lump found on mammogram in September. Had lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. Cancer was grade 1 with clear margins and clear nodes. Had radiotherapy for 3 weeks and started on tamoxifen. Felt very tired following the radiotherapy and emotionally drained. Now feel great and have returned to work. Feel very lucky that it was detected early before a lump could be felt. My heart goes out to many of the people that post on this site and wish I could hug you all.",
