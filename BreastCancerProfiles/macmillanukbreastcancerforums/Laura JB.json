    "Content": "Hi Maggie, I understand how you feel. I suffer too and I've just booked a hypnotherapy session that I hope will help me deal with the anxieties that I have during the time waiting for more tests and results. Being the person I am, I suspect I will be anxious about each stage of the journey, but just about different things, so I need to learn how to deal with it. Maybe hypnotherapy will be the answer. Well done on getting through all your treatment-that's an enormous series of hurdles you have successfully got through so well done. Laura xx",
