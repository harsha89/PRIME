    "Content": "All of the comments in this forum are so very true. I actually made ice cubes from the cranberry juice and had them by my side to suck on all the time. I found a spray in the drug store that was for the common cold, it was much easier to spray down the back of my throat instead of sucking on pops and such. And it had a sort of numbing sensation that distracted my attentions for a wee bit. Warm peppermint, camomile and ginger tea soothed the throat and helped calm me. Also, beef and chicken bouillion in the ice tray make for a nice drink and a little nutrition on those days that nothing stays down. I followed my chemo treatments with a trip to the specialty ice cream shop for just plain ole' vanilla bean ice cream, had to go immediately afterward and then the following hours and days didn't seem as bad. Try not to smell the food so much as it may be easier to process. Keep your mind busy and sleep if you are tired and don't become a hermit go outside and get fresh air. Always have drinks and food next to you at all times so even if you can take one drink or one bite it is accessible and you can just reach over and grab it. Move your bed closer to the bathroom so you are more in control of your comings and goings. Don't try to take care of everyone else for now let them take care of you. Don't be afraid to cry, let it all out but then find the good things in your life to concentrate on and smile at least once every day at yourself in the mirror. Listen to music all the time, it is a very good friend. My best wishes for you as you are going through this rocky road. Remember you have friends here to chat with when you are feeling down.",
