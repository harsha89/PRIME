My BCN told me this was quite normal, also my skin was very tender to touch, thankfully this has stopped, are you doing your exercises 3 times a day? apparently this is a must to regain full movement in the affected arm. Well done with stopping the smoking, how are you feeling without the nicotine ? I am an ex smoker, but I miss them so much.",

The side effects for me have been mild, sore eyes, sore mouth, pins and needles in my hand and feet, but my GP has given me prescriptions to sort them out, as the weeks have gone on I have felt very tired, so i just put my feet up....... but everybody reacts differently, hope this helps a little, xxxx",

I saw my oncologist on Friday and he told me I am to have 12 more rounds of chemo and then a month of radiotherapy which is what I expected, he also told me that I have a high risk of the cancer coming back, this threw me a little and it was wasn't till I  came home that the words sank in. My question is, if I have had a mastectomy and 31 lymph nodes removed, how can the cancer come back? and where would it come back? I was feeling positive, but now I am very worried, please can anyone make me feel better, thanks xxx",

I cannot stop you worrying but it was not as bad I thought, I was not in pain, more  discomfort and relief. My op was at 1.00 pm and when I came around there was a friendly face to greet me. I was kept in overnight as I ask to, and was discharged the next day with pain relief ( I only used them for one day). Fill your fridge with your favourite things and let your Hubby look after you xxxxxx Please remember why you are having the Op.",

I asked if radiotherapy would increase my chances of getting Lymphoedema she said NO because RAD would not be directed under my arm, it would be directed around my shoulder and collar bone, that put my mind at rest for the time being.
