      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, A breast cancer diagnosis does indeed make you dizzy! I got mine in April and still struggle to make sense of the change to my life. I also have a grade 3 lump (nodes clear). I have just (a week ago) completed chemo and will have surgery (lumpectomy)  in the next month. It was very difficult telling my children especially my 11 year old daughter. I read the Macmillan book 'Mummy's lump', answered all her questions honestly. She still gets upset when I am feeling poorly from chemo and both my children hated it when my hair went. But they are resilient and I keep reminding them (and myself) that it isn't forever. Tough times. Sending my very best wishes to you. Lots of us in a similar position to support you Nic xxxxxx ",

      "Content": "Hi, I have invasive ductal can carcinoma 2cm. I was diagnosed in April and have just had my final chemo (FEC-T). This week I meet with the surgeons to talk about my lumpectomy. I have seen in discussions that some people are able to combine their lumpectomy with a double breast reduction, I wonder what the criteria for being able to have this done is?  My boobs are just too big and would love a smaller pair. I would have been prepared to have a mastectomy (if it reduced the chance of cancer returning) but Have been told this isn't the case that I will have a lumpectomy. Any information most appreciated.

      "Content": "What a great forum this is. Thanks to Hedgewitch, Tracey, Grogg  and Judy for sharing your experiences in so much detail. We have all been through so much. It is great to hear when people come out the other side loving their boobs (I am sure this isn't the case for all). My tumour is in the top left quadrant so I am not sure if that lends itself to reduction or maybe they make several incisions. I will let you know what the surgeon says on Friday. Thanks again for your time. Nic xxxxxx ",
