      "Content": "Hello everyone, while helping my friend through breast cancer treatment we did all the normal fundraising activities, but i decided to do something a bit different, with the help of a good friend we set up our own website, offering information on everything to do with breastcancer including alternative treatments, what i am looking for is some feedback on the site, so if you could spare a few moments to have a good look around, and leave some comments i would be most gratefull, thankyou http://www.breastcancersearch.info",
