      "Content": "Hi Grogg, I know the thead was quite a long time ago, but I am now in the same position as you having had my op about 2 weeks ago, my Surgeon did a fabulous job too (Low grade DCIS)  I am going to see the Head Honcho in the Radiotherapy department on Friday. to discuss treatment. I was just wondering did you ever think about not having radiotherapy?  I'm just a bit worried and I know the chances are pretty slim, but it can happen. If it all starts again in the same breast, then if you did have previous radiotherapy you can have it again on the same area (As I believe) Glad all is well Pip   ",
