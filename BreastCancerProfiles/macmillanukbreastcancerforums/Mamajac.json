    "Content": "Hello. Found a lump two weeks ago. Last week had mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy and got results today. Pathology isn't even finalised but they reckon one lump of breast cancer. Doesn't look like it's spread to lymph nodes. So they're saying it's likely I'll get lumpectomy and radiotherapy and probably chemotherapy as well. Took the news pretty well, I think - at first! Now it's sinking in and my head is fuzzy and I feel on the edge of panic. Ugh. Anybody out there just been diagnosed? Or anyone who has similar situation and can offer words of wisdom? Floundering here!! I think I need a strategy to cope with the rising panic too.",
