I don\u2019t want sympathy but sometimes you want acknowledgement that you\u2019ve been through a really bloody hard time.  Xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi all I finished treatment end of October 2017; had mastectomy (left breast) and reconstruction & Chemo. I feel it\u2019s only now that it\u2019s really hit me that I had cancer! Emotionally it\u2019s hitting me much more now.  I guess cos during treatment I was just trying to get through each day, particularly with chemo as I suffered really badly with side effects. Im not sleeping very well (a side effect of anastrazole I think) and have bad dreams about the cancer coming back. Does anyone else have this? Also even though I tried cold cap, I lost my hair. So look different - which I think is making me feel nervous about going back to work and how people will react. Most of the time I\u2019m pretty positive but some days it is hard. I just wondered how others have found things after treatment and how it was getting back \u201cto normal\u201d. Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Hi I had a diep flap reconstruction which was a big op but I'm glad I had it.  (First time I have stayed in hospital ever)!! I know people mean well but when people say about my hair \"oh it'll grow back\" - I know that! but it doesn't make it any easier.  I loved my hair :( Also there is still pain on my tummy and boob where I had the reconstruction, not bad pain more sore and feels odd cos its numb, that stuff people don't see, you have to deal with on a daily basis.  Also the worry of the cancer coming back - I'm struggling with that at the moment. I feel like its only now it is hitting me - I had cancer !  I'm due to go back to work after Easter, I couldn't work I felt too ill and am really nervous, it feels like starting a new job. It is good to know that others feel the same and that I'm not going mad :) Please babble away we're all hear to listen.  My name is Moira, age 53. Thanks xx",
