      "Content": "Hi all, not been on for a while since my wife was given the all clear but i have a question... My wife had triple negative BC, chemo, lumpectomy and radio. that all finished maybe 8 weeks ago but she is suffering with back pain so as you can imagine she is absolutely convinced she has some kind of secondary in her back/bones etc. speaking to the oncologist following radio he seemed happy it was muscular and the BC nurses just refer to him. now then, i trust he doctors, they've been great throughout but she is nervous, i know she is and i'm not sure what i can do to convince her it is ok. she is pushing for some scans but we don't seem to be getting anywhere. has anyone else had experience of back pain following radio? i've read a few bits on line saying side effects can be here there or anywhere but peoples actual experiences are always more convincing with them being in the correct context (if you get what i mean!). Thanks, Matthew x",

      "Content": "Hi, yes she had chemo but no ongoing medication with her bc being triple negative. It's just hard to convince her it's nothing, even if it is just to put her mind at rest the scans/blood tests will be worth it. I believe she is just doing a lot more now than she has for the last year, we've two young kids so days are pretty hectic. If it keeps bothering her we will probably go down the gp route as the breast care nurses are adamant it's nothing (fair enough). Thank you all x",

      "Content": "Hi all, my wife is having her last chemo (6 cycles) for triple negative breast cancer next week and although this is obviously good she is now starting to worry about the next step. i guess it is natural, we've had the re-assurance of seeing the consultant every 3 weeks for last few months and now it will stop, her breast lump is no longer able to be found but she had lumps in her lymph nodes which have lost maybe 50% of the size but no more. the consultant said this isn't a bad thing, the treatment is about more than lumps, its about minimising what needs to be done with surgery so a remaining lump isn't necessarily a sign that the medicine isn't working any more! im not sure what im asking to be honest, im struggling to think what to say to the wife, ive no idea. all i know is what the consultant has said but i know that now the treatment is coming to an end all the bad thoughts are creeping back, it is like the beginning again, meetings and scans etc. How have other people found this stage? the consultant said that lymph nodes can be scared from tumours and maybe the lump will not disappear completely, that's probably right, she knows better than us obviously! sorry for wittering on, just thought id type this to see how others found this part of the process so i could share it with her. Thanks and all the best x",

      "Content": "Today my wife was given the all clear following triple negative breast cancer, 6 rounds of chemo, a lumpectomy and a detached retina bizarrely. she still needs some radio but they have confirmed she is NED and can relax a bit. This site has been a massive help for us both, she's not on here but i've been on a lot and i know as a resource ive found it such a big help, i know i struggled a lot at first, perhaps anxiety or something but being able to talk to others in the same situation really put my mind at ease, i cannot thank you all enough. its amazing how people take the time to be on here, during treatment and after. perhaps you feel obliged, i kind of do now and will definitely check in now and again because if you only help one person feel better it is worth it. This terrible disease affects too many people, its stolen a year from my wife and my kids but she is still here and cancer free so i'm sticking two fingers up to cancer and were going on holiday. Keep smiling people, i know it doesn't work out like this for everyone and i guess this will always be a part of our lives now but its certainly moved our focus and made us realise how precious certain things are, work to live don't live to work, enjoy your time with the family and remember what really matters. I sincerely hope each and everyone one of you lives long, happy lives, thank you again, you have all helped me and my family x",
