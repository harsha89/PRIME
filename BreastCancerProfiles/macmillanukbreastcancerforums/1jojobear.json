    "Content": "I've only just signed up today. My mum who is 79 has just been diagonised with stage 4 breast cancer, but looking at her you would never believe it. These last 4weeks of waiting for test results have been hell and all I can feel nowÂ is numb. I'm having trouble sleeping as I can't switch off. I'm trying to be a support to my mum, but I'm struggling myself. Any recommendations ???",
