      "Content": "My mum is in hospital at the moment breast cancer spread to her bones and now liver(we're still waiting to speak to the doc) me and my sister are trying to let as many people know as possible but its difficult to know where to start without going through my mums belongings.my dad doesn't seem to realise that she is so ill one thing has shocked me though my mum had a lot to do with the church and was a regular helper etc at various events etc but no- one has even bothered to contact her, send a card and i have let them know.... i thought one way of looking people up would be to go on friends reunited site. anyway that was a really sad story and it just proves what can happen .",

Again i say you find out who your friends really are. This site is also a great help.",

      "Content": "Since my mum died on Sunday i have done alot of thinking. When she first started having pains in legs docs thought it was her veins when really she should have delved deeper and sent her for a bone scan as by the time she did have one it had spread. my mum was always too trusting of the docs and nurses and never complained, asked questions etc",
