I think I'm just still trying to get my head around things, when I was initially referred to the breast clinic I honestly thought they would say it's nothing so to be told I have cancer was a massive shock as I'm only 29.  Sam x",

Sorry I'm only just messaging back, had my sentinel node biopsy yesterday and wasn't actually that bad, bit sore today but nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be! Once my wound has healed I will start chemo as they want to shrink the tumour before operating on it, keeping my fingers crossed that it just completely gets rid of it! Bit anxious about chemo but it's on my side and it's going to make me feel like s**t but it's also going to make me better :) so just got to take the rough with the smooth xxx thank you all again for your lovely responses xxxx Sam xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Misty, I finished chemo on the 19th and it honestly was nowhere near as bad as I through it would be. I had the t first then the fec, the t wasn't too bad, kept my eyelashes, eyebrows and never fully lost my hair. I found my rough days where 3-5 after the steroids wore off and by rough I mean fatigued and not feeling completely with it! But everyone's experience is the same, if your coping ok on the fec I'm sure you'll be ok with the t, just take each day as it comes, I wrote a diary of how I felt for the first 7 days as t is very predictable so how you feel on the first cycle will probably be the same on subsequent cycles, that's what I found anyway xx ",
