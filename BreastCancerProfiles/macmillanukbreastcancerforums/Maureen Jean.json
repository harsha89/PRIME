    "Content": "I only came on this site yesterday, but have already found it so helpful. Thanks very much all of you for taking the time to write. I was diagnosed with bi-lateral breast cancer at the end of October. The tumour on one side was large so they put me on chemotherapy first. This worked well, and I had few side effects. The tumour was reduced by 75%. Next Monday (11th August) I have surgery for bi-lateral mastectomy!! They will take out all the lymph nodes on one side and 10 on the other. Later will have radiotherapy, but not for a while. So this has been a very very long journey for me. I was grateful to read of all the comments about swelling and numbness and the difficulty at first with the exercising. These are the things that concern me. I keep wondering what I will be like this time next week! I have found it helpful to read your comments as I feel it equips me better for the immediate future. Were you in a lot of pain when you woke up from the operation, or was it more discomfort? It is getting back the use of my arms that concerns me most. I understand some people, although they exercise, are still unable to raise their arms. I am praying about that!! Can't bear the thought! I live fairly near lots of you - Margate. The surgeon at Margate Hospital is a woman - Miss Sharp - who has an excellent reputation. By this time next week I will have experienced her skills!",
