    "Content": "Hi guys, This post is about my mother in law.  She has just told us that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer 6 years ago. Now she doesn't feel well and she has fungating wound on her breast, so she told us about her diagnosis. She didn't do anything, didn't go to any doctors and I don't even know if she has been formally diagnosed or not, I suspect this might be just a palpation.  However, now she has this fungating wound so even if there is no formal diagnosis, we need to do something.  The problem is that she lives abroad (Russia) and she is afraid of going to any doctors. I am considering what is the best thing I can do. Ideally, I would like to bring her over here (London) for consultation and treatment, so she can stay with us. But I don't know where to go for it, which clinic or doctor - any suggestions? As I won't have any referral (she doesn\u2019t have any) and this is clearly a private consultation. She is one of those people who would be extremely difficult to persuade to go to doctor. So I don't know how to persuade her to come over here yet. I think my first step should be to find some solution for her breast wound and how to care about it. I found a number of websites on this, but not sure how to proceed, perhaps I should consult with a local nurse here in UK and then contact my mother in law over phone and suggest her what she can do with it. But how to arrange a consultation with a doctor/nurse here who is experienced with such wounds and without having a patient here? Or perhaps there is any online/over phone service that I can use to talk to doctors/nurses and get their advise. Does anyone here has any experience with any of this?   I will be extremely grateful for any feedback and suggestions/ideas. Andrey",
