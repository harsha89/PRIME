      "Content": "Hi there,  Im no expert on the sentinel node biopsy but just thought I'd share that I had exactly the same op as you last Wednesday.  I had reconstruction at the same time and also had a lump under my arm.  They removed two out ofthe three levels of lymph nodes.  I must say they have done a great job and I haven't been in much pain at all. II've just been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen.  I think that they do a sentinel node biopsy when they don't already know if the nodes are affected during a mastectomy or lumpectomy and then if that is positive they go back and remove all nodes but as I say im no expert. Anyway good luck tomorrow and it really wasn't as bad as expected.  Rachel ",

      "Content": "Hi there,   I have been thinking of having my ovaries removed and am going to discuss it again tomorrow with my oncologist.  She mentioned about having zoladex injections but I'm 33 and you can only have them for 2 years so im thinking removal of my ovaries may be more long term but she said there are disadvantages doing this so young.  I am hoping to have the gene test and if I carry the gene will definitely have everything removed!  Take care everyone Rachel xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there,  I had similar surgery a couple of weeks ago and my underarm is very sore. I had 2 drains in and the second will be removed tomorrow.  My cut for the lymph nodes is quite far down my side rather that under my armpit so have been able to wash with a flannel as I have waterproof dressings on. I have been a lot more positive since my op but worried about getting my results tomorrow.  Keep strong it will get better. My mum had the same op as me 17 years ago and she has been fine since. Im only 32 so feel upset that im going through this so young.   Rachel x",
