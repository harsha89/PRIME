    "Content": "Hi everyone, I've recently had two lumpectomys and am seeing oncologist next week about starting radiotherapy. Apart from the pain and swelling and general feeling of yuck, I've also been told to stop taking my HRT medication - I'm 46 and had a hysterectomy a few years ago and was told I needed to take it as I was under 50. My issue is that I'm having major trouble sleeping and the night sweats/hot flushes are just getting worse and worse.Â  Has anyone experienced anything similar? And if so, did you find a solution? Am knackered and just feeling really down with it all :-(",
