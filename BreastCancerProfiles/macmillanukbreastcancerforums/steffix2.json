    "Content": "Hi Fec is a combination therapy known to be very effective against Breast Cancer. I had the Fec combination Chemo 6 years ago, kept on the strongest dose and given 8 treatments instead of 6. First 2 were difficult but after that l did not have to many problems. Yes l lost my hair but was prpepared for that. The main thing for me and others l knew on it at the time was the metalic taste it left after about 10 days to about 16 days. It is a harsh treatment but its proven to beat the fight against cancer. Good luck on your journey and god bless",
