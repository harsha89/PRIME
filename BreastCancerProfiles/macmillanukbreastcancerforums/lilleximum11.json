      "Content": "Well I'm not sure about chemo at the moment but decided to do it as I'd not be able to cope with my hair and I'm glad I have as I was informed on Tuesday I'm to have a Breast reduction cos my assets are really big and radio side affects will be worse for me and/or it may not work properly so my lovely surgeon has talked through everything with me. also with me having fibromyalga she wants to minimise the pain from radio I could have. I've been wanting a reduction for 13 yrs so I look at it that I was sent this B*tch for me to get my reduction at last. She gunna try deduce me by approx 5 or 6 cup sizes omg xxxxx I think that's about right.  At the moment im a GG/H gunna get reduced to approx D cup xxxx ",

      "Content": "well on Friday 11/9/15 I'll be having my final chemo. On wed 9/9/15 I had my genetics bloods took I'm having braca1&2 tested so call mates think I'm crazy wanting to know if got a fault in my genes but I want peice of mind and if I have then things that are of risk to me are being removed. These so called friends also think I'm being selfish but they don't realise it was a fluke I found my lump it was grade 3 and we all know that worst grade u can get so if I'd not found it when I did when I finally showed things could have been a hell of a lot worse; they don't seem to understand how serious this could have been. My underwire bra which at the time a flaming hated saved my life xxxxxx Huggles to all and hope everyone is doing well xxxxxxxx    joey-Sarah xxxxx ",

      "Content": "Thank you all I'm sat here crying at the moment (sorry) I did have second biopsy yesterday (Monday) got pre-op today but cos of the biopsy I have made my mind up I want mastectomy I'm big chested so the Bi*ches will appear long before I notice them.  I suffer MHI and have been told it's hard enough taking news in without having MHI my CPN has been told of my dessicon and she thinks because it's all I've thought about and finally decided that it's a good idea as even a cyst I'd panic which yes I know is normal todo once you have been dignoised with BC.  My 14yr old daughter knows as much as I do but my 4yr old daughter only knows I have poorly Boobie I have the big talk with the younger one to do soon. My eldest daughter doesn't live with me so I can talk with her over the phone about it all. this weekend my eldest daughter is home so we have agreed that we will sit and look through her book and talk more and I'm gunna give her links that she may want to use.  Thank all again Joey-Sarah xxx",
