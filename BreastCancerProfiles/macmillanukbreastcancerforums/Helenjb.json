MRI showed shadows in liver, spine and breast. Getting CT results tomorrow. I am so scared. I'm 40, 2 girls age 10 and5, I don't want to though I all again. The leaflet they give out talks about palliative care,treatment only, no cure n it terrifies me.....",

      "Content": "Hello all, well worst news was given Wednesday. Secondary breast cancer in chest wall, spine and liver Nd recurrence in breast. Even though I knew really, it was a shock. Unfortunately the treatment plan they had in mind was no good. They wanted to give a new drug, progetta with docataxel , as progetta is only licenced to be given with docataxel . But last time I was allergic to docataxel so they have to see what they can do now. Scared, so scared. Bottom line is, we have to see what happens after chemo. Herceptin for life but if tumours haven't shrunk after chemo I'm not sure what else there is to do. I keep looking at my girls and wondering if I will see them grow up.",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying ravven. I used chat on here a lot with my first diagnosis but I drifted away as I got stronger. I'm not very positive at the moment but I will get there. It scares me that if I hadn't pushed about a pain under my arm I would still b ignorant. Consultant said nerve damage but I didn't believe nerve damage would start 2 years after treatment. Will post tomorrow, have MRI at 1 and onc appointment at 2...",

      "Content": "Thanks Dorothee, I'm not ready for counselling yet. I don wan people to say there there it's ok, cos its so not! I just want tomorrow to be over so I know what is to be done. I have a fab breast nurse, who cried with me when I got my new results. I can talk to her. The thought of telling my mum, the kids, my school. ( I'm a primary teacher) is overwhelming. It's all overwhelming. We had a birthday party for my youngest yesterday and it was all I could not t cry, kept thinking, what if its the last birthday I see. It's the idea of it not being curable that scares me. How long can you live with it, what is the quality of life? My hubby is wonderful, but quiet and I don't want to say all this to him.",

I know that I need someone to talk me through the 'what if I don't see my girls married?' Thoughts. If I sleep tonight I will be amazed. It could all be nothing, it could be bad, it's the waiting that's horrid!",
