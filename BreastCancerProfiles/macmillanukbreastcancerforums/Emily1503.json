      "Content": "What a way to spend a Thursday evening after calling nhs 24 I'm now sitting in the out of hours at the local hospital! My symptoms seem to be getting worse daily and this evening the pain was so intense, like being stabbed in the nipple with a hot burning needle and a small area beside the nipple became swollen with a rash. I only called them to see if I should try and push my clinic appointment (17th) forward. Do you think they will do anything tonight? Tests etc? Xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone! Just looking to ask a quick question! I'm currently waiting on my first urgent referral to the breast clinic after different symptoms in my left breast and the gp finding a very tender \"area of concern\" behind the nipple (though she said she couldn't feel a lump!) tonight I was sitting on the kitchen worktop and my husband lifted me off (my arms around his neck and legs around his waist) well when he lifted me, his chest pressed against mine and the pain in my left breast is unreal... seriously throbbing now! I've just taken some painkillers and whipped my bra off but wondering if it's something I should alert my gp to even though I have been referred or has anyone any other advice? Thanks xx",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply! Can I contact the breast clinic directly about my appointment do you think or is that usually done through the gp? It's just that from what I've read on here, a fast track appointment is within 2 weeks although my gp said she hoped I'd be seen within 2-6 weeks (she did say she was putting it through as an urgent referral though) the pain is now only easing off and that happened about 6 hours ago!xx",

Tbh mine have always had quite prominent bumps, even more so when I was pregnant with my 3 kids! The dr had noticed that on my problem breast, it's as if the areola has spread, almost bruise like with thickening of skin and prominent veins running through. Do you have any of that? Hope Thursday brings you good news and sending lots of wishes Em x",
