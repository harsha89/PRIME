    "Content": "Gina I ended up so breathless my final docetaxel was cancelled. I was admitted to hospital, checked for a possible clot in lung, had heart scans in case the docetaxel/Herceptin combo had damaged my heart. My resting heart rate was through the roof! I was discharged, still breathless and none the wiser! Weeks later when having another CT scan a nurse commented on my blue lips (hadn't noticed myself). I then twigged it was asthma. I've since found out that excess stomach acid (common after chemo) can cause asthma. Mine wasn't picked up on because I had no wheezing, the stomach acid was getting into my lungs. I had a sore mouth and assumed it was the docetaxel coming back for another little go! Not so! I've since been prescribed Lansoprazole to dampen down the acid - what a difference!!!Â ",
