    "Content": "Hi.. I had a single mastectomy with immediate DIEP recon, just over 2 weeks ago. It\u2019s early days in terms of my recovery - I\u2019m still very stiff and sore - but suspect that would be the same regardless of the route I\u2019d chosen. What I can say is that I\u2019m delighted I decided to do it all in one go and that I went for a DIEP. They\u2019ve managed to keep the same overall shape (mine was a skin-sparing procedure), and although the scarring is dramatic at this stage, I can already see that it will look amazing in the end. I\u2019ve lost the nipple (I had DCIS), but otherwise, it looks pretty much like me. I also have an amazing flat stomach - flatter than it\u2019s been for 30 years. Another factor for me is that I\u2019m self employed, so didn\u2019t want to have to take 2 periods of time off work if I could possibly avoid it. Yes the recovery period is longer, but it\u2019s only a matter of a few extra weeks or so.",
