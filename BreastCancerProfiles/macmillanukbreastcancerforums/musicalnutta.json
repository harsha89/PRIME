      "Content": "Hi Both I had a mastectomy with reduction, node clearance and reconstruction done 3 weeks ago tomorrow.  After having been through chemo it was so much less traumatic and painful than I expected.  I had no stitches or dressings to deal with just glue over dissolvable stitches. I had two drains in which kept producing over 100mls every 24 hours each for nearly 10 days with one and up to the 10 days with the other.  But this is quite common with a larger bust.  I had a morphine pump initially in hospital but once that stopped I managed with paracetamol or no pain relief at all.   Even I was surprised as to how low the pain levels were it was more discomfort than pain.  The arm and arm pit are still much more painful than the breast.  But I manage to do most of my exercises without too much discomfort.  I have been very fortunate in that I only have an anchor shaped scar/wound on the breast and they were able to do the node clearance through the same incision rather than having to cut the arm put.  My mum had an incision right the way around from behind the armpit and around and up to the breast bone. So it depends on what your surgical plan is. So many different ways of doing the same thing!  As I had no wound in the arm pit I was told I could use a natural deoderant with no aluminium etc in whereas mum wasn't allowed to use anything for quite some time. I was also recommended Sanex Zero shower gel by my nurse for cleaning the area.  I found having a thin heart shaped pillow under the arm the most comfortable and I have a thicker one to rest the arm on just to keep the pressure off the drain sites. I still carry it now, especially in the car for all the bumps!  I was really nervous about having the drains out as I had heard they hurt when coming out.  The one in the arm pit was uncomfortable but it was over so quickly. The one in the breast didn't hurt at all-Iwas still waiting for the nurse to do it and she was standing there with it in her hand!  My nurse gave me a runners bottle belt to put my drain bottle in to fasten around my waist. I looked ridiculous with two on but it freed up my hands. Also a cross body bag or a wine bottle bag were helpful.   I found a front fastening soft crop top type bra an absolute godsend. Especially keeping the remaining breast vaguely under control to stop it pulling.   And I sleep in it too so there is no tugging.  It also helped hold the drains close to the body too. I got mine from Asda online, not expensive and wash and wear like a dream. They have a nice selection online only and one of the few places that do G cup post surgery bras.  Three weeks on I am able to use my arm much more but I have needed help with most things up until now. I have tried to make sure I moved my arm as much as possible as soon as possible so that I didn't get a frozen shoulder.  Sorry for rambling on-trying to cover as much as I can remember. If you have any questions please drop me a line. I hope everything goes as smoothly for you as it has for me.  Jen ",

      "Content": "Hi Dee You sound like you have had a bit of a rough one with the surgery. Sorry to hear that.  Lovely that your daughter was able to come over and help. My mum, having been through all this 5 years ago came to help me. It's amazing all the little things that help. I haven't come accross the moon pillow before!  When do you start chemo? I did chemo first and finished my 6 rounds at the start of May. I'm due to start radio in a week or two and I've just started my hormone therapy.  I get my first inflation of my implant on Tuesday that should be interesting!  I tried driving for the first time today also! Managed just fine but I might not tell my partner just yet it's quite nice him doing all the driving for a change!! Lol. I hope chemo isn't too bad for you.  Jen  ",

      "Content": "Hi Cassa I had pagets and a tumour. Mine wasn't that bad even right up until surgery.. it took 3 visits to get them to biopsy everything and then discovered it was cancer and pagets! They said it still only l9oked like a little patch of eczema!  I had chemo followed by surgery and I am due to start radio soon.  The only time pagets has really caused any kind of 'issue' was surgery as they had to remove more skin and as I was a 38G..... that was quite a lot. But the surgery went well and I have an expanding implant it and so far have had no post surgical complications. I'm only 7 weeks post surgery tomorrow and still going strong.  I'm not as big as I used to be but it's all a work in progress and who knows where I will be at the end of treatment!  I don't know if any of this helps but if you have questions.... feel free to ask.  Good luck.  Jen",

      "Content": "Hi I finished chemo in May and my hair had already started growing back. Some had never gone but I attached them with the scissors!  I had my first trim about 2 weeks ago so it was all even. I have a pixie cut and have been without wig for 6 weeks or so now. Letting the air and sun to the scalp will have done it good. I've also been using Lee Stafford's Hair Growth range. Whether it's helped or not my hairdresser said it won't do anything harm and smells lovely! ",
