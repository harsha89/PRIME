    "Content": "I found my very small lump by chance, and thought it was just a cyst (I get lots). It was not visible, was small and felt as if it moved a little. I only went to the GP because a friend told me to get it checked out - and I am so glad I did. Do not delay. 90% of lumps are not cancerous, but you are not wasting anyone's time by getting it checked out.",
