    "Content": "Hi I'm not sure whether I'm posting this in the right group or not, but my Mum was diagnosed with grade 3 Breast Cancer in June. It was found through a routine mammogram, so it was a big shock to the system. She was told that she had 2 lumps in one breast, she has had the operation to remove the lumps and was told that they had caught it in time and the cancer hasn't spread. Mum was told that she would most likely need Radiotherapy, purely as a preventative. She's now been given different options, either have the Radiotherapy or have Chemo. The Chemo was suggested due to it being a grade 3 cancer She is undecided and I know that she's stressing about the different options, obviously it is her decision at the end of the day. I feel useless watching her go through all of this. I'm scared for her and I feel selfish for getting upset about it.  At the moment, all I can do is offer my support to whatever the decision is, but I hate this whole situation. My family are all being supportive, however I can't talk with them about any of this. I don't really have a confidant.  I think this post is more a chance for me to get my thoughts out. Is it wrong for me to be feeling this way?",
