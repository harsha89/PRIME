      "Content": "Hello, Thank you for the information. It\u2019s good to know and is useful as my lovely GP is very open to listening/reading information that her patients have gathered regarding their condition. She has referred me to the hospital physio and also some counselling for helping me deal with my menopausal symptoms. How successful these will be remains to be seen - it is a start. I have found that my pre existing problems with my neck are indeed worse, the GP doesn\u2019t think the chest tightness is affecting it but I am not so sure. The physio should be able to determine whether it is or not. It\u2019s a start but I am glad to have your and the other information I have been given so that I can take it with me when I get my appointment. I\u2019m not sure if it will be a physiotherapist with experience of breast cancer patients.  Iwill keep you posted",

      "Content": "Hi Pica Pica, sorry I have been so long in getting back to you - I am not getting very far which is why I haven\u2019t been in touch. The physiotherapist told me that my problem is without her experience and took extensive notes, gave me some more exercises and said she would speak with the MacMillan nurse here. I have just spoken with the nurse and she is now going to speak with my doctor and take it from there. I explained that what I really need is to get a diagnosis so that I know what I am dealing with in the first place. I also told her about your diagnosis.  I hope you are finding ways to manage all the effects of your treatments, I have also been having some counselling over the last few weeks which is helping to put myself in a better place. I hope you are too. X",

      "Content": "Hi Pica Pica, just read your \u201c10 months post op\u201d blog. Very interested - I think that you are right to keep asking as from my experience this certainly doesn\u2019t go away. I have been doing all that I can without help and it\u2019s like trying to keep the tide from coming in. I just don\u2019t think I can do it myself and it certainly gets worse when I exercise less.  I will be seeing my GP tomorrow and keep you posted.   Mrs C",

      "Content": "Hi Pica Pica,  Good to hear that you have a result - at least you know what you are dealing with. It does sound familiar as the seromas that I had were loculated. I am now, apart from a very small area around my second mastectomy, quite flat. You can see the line beyond which my muscles can\u2019t go and the ribs underneath - the skin tight over the top. I did not have radiotherapy but had very hard immobile lumps which I have massaged very vigorously on a daily basis over the last 2 years. I wonder if I had the same thing as you and am now left with just the scar tissue. I have now got a appointment with a senior physiotherapist at the hospital September 12 so will hopefully get some answers . It is helpful to know what you have discovered. Whether the is much that can be done may be a different thing but I will be happier to know what is going on.  I also have been given the details of a meditation and mindfulness group which I will contact when I get home next week  - I\u2019m visiting my Dad just now. I will let you know how I get on with the physiotherapist . I am not holding my breath through I will be very happy if they can help. If I get a diagnosis with no satisfactory solutions then I will seek a second opinion as I have discovered in the past that treatment from NHS can vary greatly from similar professionals working privately - my husband was offered a tendon release operation as a last resort for severe tennis elbow. It would have been disastrous for his job. When he went privately to a recommended physiotherapist she sorted him out with a lot of manipulation over a lengthy period. I\u2019m a huge fan of the NHS but it is under a lot of stress nowadays.  Don\u2019t give up on finding a solution that will suit you better, it\u2019s still relatively speaking to me, early days for your scar tissue. Despite having radiotherapy it is surely better to have some form of treatment to dissipate the scar tissue- and better  sooner rather than later - I have a lovely GP but she\u2019s not specialist in her knowledge of cancer related problems and is very open to any suggestions that I may have if I have the research and adequate information to give her.  Good to hear from you, I\u2019ll keep in touch.",

      "Content": "Good speaking with you as well Pica Pica.  It helps talking with someone who has a similar problem. I think an ultrasound is next - the MacMillan nurse is going to liaise with my GP - she asked me if I would like one and I said that I would be glad of anything that could help to diagnose what my problem is.  I am less stressed now that I\u2019m trying to find out what\u2019s happening, not so sure how I will feel if I can\u2019t get a result.  The counselling is helping me - there was a lot going on before my cancer diagnosis - it hadn\u2019t gone away while I have been dealing with the results of my cancer and still needs to be dealt with along with everything else. I have never talked so much about myself ! Having been feeling so bad I will appreciate it all the more when I get back on track. I will let you know what I find out and how I get along. All the best. X",
