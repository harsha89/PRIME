    "Content": "I understand how down you are about putting on weight. Through by womb cancer (hysterectomy and oopherectomy, followed by my breast cancer I've put on a stone and a half!!! Gone up between two and three dress sizes!!!! Had loads of steroids when having my chemotherapy ..... gone into a very early menopause ........ gone middle aged!!!! Trying to come to terms with my new shape and throwing out my size 8 and 10 clothes ....... Like you, family and friends all say I look much better for the extra weight, but I feel so unattractive ......... so fat ........ No matter what I do, I can't lose it .......... think I'm just going to have to come to terms with the new shape and get on with life .....",
