      "Content": "Hi Clair Thank you so much for your reply. Like you I can't stop running my fingers through my hair and pulling more out!!! I have a wig and a few lovely caps but I will look at the website you suggested as I need some scarves (don't think I will want to wear the wig all the time)!!! I think it's just the fact that I have just come to terms with my mastectomy and now I'm losing my hair and I have always made an effort to do my hair, make-up and stuff. But you are so right - it's not forever and i have been really positive up to now. Tomorrow is a new day. Hope you are okay. Sounds like the cold cap has really helped you. xxx      ",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your replies - they really made me laugh and I feel much better today. I love the 'lady garden' comments (I call it my foo foo - think that comes from having daughters)!!!! And it is so true that you can find positives in everything. Soon I won't have to wax, shave, pluck or trim!!!! Nor will I have to shampoo, condition, blowdry or straighten!!!! I have worked out that that is going to give me at least an extra 6 hours a week. Now I need to think of something I can with that time. ANY SUGGESTIONS? Please keep it clean!!!! HA! HA! Thanks again for the advice, tips and support. It really does help. Hope you are all well and enjoying the beautiful sunshine.

      "Content": "Hi Ruthie I know how you are feeling. I had my mastectomy in March and started chemo 13th April. I had my 2nd chemo yesterday and I am feeling okay. Like you I really liked my hair and was very scared about how I would feel. But I did take the good advice given by the fantastic people on this site and I had my hair cut short. Although it is upsetting when it starts to fall out I think it would have been a lot worse if my hair had still been long. I decided to get my husband to shave my head on Tuesday night and I did cry. No matter how much you try to prepare yourself it is a bit of a shock seeing yourself bald. But I woke up yesterday morning and felt a lot better. No more hairy pillows, blocked showers or loose hair around the house. I spent the morning trying on my hats and scarves and decided to give my wig it's first outing. I wore it to the hospital for my chemo and the staff and patients made me feel much better. Today I was brave enough to go out into the garden 'commando' style and it felt quite liberating. I am really suprised by how quickly I have accepted my 'baldness' as I have always made an effort to look my best and take a lot of care in my appearance. You have to find the best way for you to deal with it but all I can say is that it is not as bad as I feared. Deal with one day at a time and some days you will feel low but these do lessen and you get through them. Accept when you are finding it difficult and talk to someone. Embrace the good days and do something everyday to make yourself feel good whether it's going for a walk, having a pamper or meeting a friend. Big hugs to you. Stay strong. xxx",
