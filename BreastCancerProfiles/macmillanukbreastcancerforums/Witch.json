      "Content": "Hi Caz , I had my 5th round of FEC chemo on 13th March and yep I've had the same symptoms as you awful constipation and the feeling that there's something laying at the top of my throats drinking is ok but eating takes for ever and it's like the food is just sitting there . I've been drinking Mango juice because I can't taste anything but need to dilute it as it makes my mouth sore , but I think it helped with the constipation but took 3 days . I might phone my chemo nurse and ask her advice . I haven't been much help I'm afraid but just wanted you to know you aren't alone . Sending big hugs and love from \"Witch\" xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone When I first saw the advert I did think WHY get people to shave their head ! Losing my hair through chemo wasn't pleasant wearing a hat/wig because I felt self concious was nice especially in hot weather being bald is a constant reminder of the treatment I and many other people have gone through I did think maybe I was being over sensitive I can see I'm not alone in thinking it's in poor taste ! Im sorry Macmillan but you have got this so wrong !! I appreciate the work and support that you do but I will not encourage my family and friends to shave their heads it the last thing I want .
