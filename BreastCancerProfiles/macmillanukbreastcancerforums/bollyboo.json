      "Content": "LondonLass Thanks ronstar, hopefully my body will adjust, eventually! Have woken this morning feeling rough! But hopefully the pain relief will kick in soon! I need to remember I am a year older today......so I need to expect the odd niggle  clearly I'm well past my best before date  But I haven't lost my sense of humour!! Xx Hi London Lass You sound amazing, but doing too much too soon. I was a breast care practitioner with a large well known company for more than 20 years. One of my key tasks was working with HR and helping breast cancer patients (our staff) back to work. We had overwhelming success by re starting work gradually. For example, as we were in central London, I would recommend avoiding rush hour either side of the working day. I would build up their hours as to when their best energy levels were, so if you sleep badly, early morning may not be best for you or maybe it would, if you can get home early for a sleep.(and help with the baby). I used to help my patients work just a few hours on alternate days for quite a while, adding an hour extra each week if they coped well. Is there somewhere you could lie down mid -day ?  Our staff working in stores were put on light duties , not lifting or handling anything which could give them pain and fellow staff would more than understand this. Do you have an occupational health department ? This is one of their key roles, or should be. You say you can't cut your hours , are you sure. A good boss will do everything to help you adjust. Can you do a couple of days working from home? Could you have a day off in the middle of a 5 day week. Can you have more help with your baby (the most exhausting of jobs I ever had !!)  Try and brace yourself for a meeting with your manager/ HR/ Occ Health- whoever you work with, maybe job sharing for a while. You need to believe it will definitely benefit you (and your employers) in the long term. Massive respect for you . Good luck x",

My husband was increasingly breathless over a course of 2 days.and it was a pulmonary embolism which was treated fast with anticoagulants . He had no leg pain from a dvt to alert us. Best of luck Annabelle x",

      "Content": "Hello , very sorry to hear your diagnosis . My husband had a breast lump which was lymphoma (not yours ) and has had 3 cycles of chemo so far and is responding  . My best advice is to ring The Lymphoma Association. I had Dawn who I kept ringing and ringing  and was wonderful. Freephone helpline is 0808 808 5555 They have very informative booklets and also Leukaemia Research (0207 405 0101) have a helpline and a booklet on Non-Hogkins Lymphoma.The lymphoma Association cover concerns about fertility, hair loss, clinical trials, basically everything. Once you have a treatment plan in place you may feel less helpless. Treatment is very tiring so I would suggest start planning for help with whatever you need. My hubby definitely cant work with it but was very ill before diagnosis. If you are going to be treated at a large centre of excellence, you will be in the hands of experts. We chose Southampton rather than our local Isle of Wight, despite the tiring journey. Other bits to sort out would be your teeth, as dental work during chemo is usually a no-no. Buy a soft baby toothbrush and difflam mouthwash and difflam spray ready. They dont like you flossing.This can all be prescribed free at the hosp once you get going.   Have a smoothie maker or blender to hand . Try and research the drugs you are given , for instance procarbazine means you cant have mature or live cheese ,advocardos and a whole load of other restrictions. Your cancer is of your lymphatic system, so your immune system is affected and even without chemo, you will be prone to infections. Dont have any live vaccinations (as in shingles) but ask about flu and pneumonia jabs. Buy a good thermometer. we bought a digital one for the mouth and it's been very reliable but I know they use ear ones in hospital .I would also either follow this wonderful community or see if Macmillan have on line community for Lymphoma.   Things we wished we had known before day one of treatment. Is there a Macmillan centre at your hospital for you to have a rest. Usually what happens is you go to the lymphoma clinic where you see a doctor in the morning. You have bloods done usually an hour before this so they can assess if you are fit for chemo. Then you have to wait 4 hours for the pharmacy to prepare the prescription and have chemo nearby if there is an oncology centre. Try to take someone with you to take notes and collect any other pills/injections whilst you have chemo. Good if they drive you home. Learn to report the slightest concern, you will be given emergency info and its proved valuable to us. Keep people away who have a sore throat or colds. Educate them that you have little or no immunity to their germs. Carry anti bacterial hand wash everywhere and a pack of wipes. Become basically OCD! I wish you so much luck and support. xx",

      "Content": "singagirl66, i so hope by now you are feeling a bit supported and soon get a treatment plan and can start ticking the months off. In the early days before we met the chemo lymphoma team, Dawn from Lymphoma Association was more than amazing. Just gather all the help you can around you .Try and keep warm and have a comfy bedroom and a warm sofa. We learnt to make more of the tv and ask friends to recommend dramas. (just watched Apple Tree Yard !!!) much love Bolly xx",
