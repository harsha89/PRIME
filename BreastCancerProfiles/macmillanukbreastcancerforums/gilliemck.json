      "Content": "i finished chemo and radiotherapy two months ago. All seemed well, then i felt as if I'd be hit by a bus........every joint in my body ached so badly,could hardly move. pain has eased quite a bit now, except pain in breast, where i had surgery and radiotherapy. is this usual? the pain is so bad I'm not sleeping,can hardly move my arm as it causes pain. I had triple neg breast cancer,so I'm not on any meds now.Â  I think i just want to be reassured this is normal......and its not something sinister. feel my head will burst with worry, trying to be positive for all around me as I don't want them to worry.",
