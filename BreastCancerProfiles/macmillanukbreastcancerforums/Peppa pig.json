      "Content": "Evening. I had a lumpectomy and two lymph nodes removed just under 2 weeks ago. The arm the nodes were removed from has had a really strange sensation for around a week. It's my skin, upper arm, and is like friction burn / rough lace aggravating the skin / sunburn.  Any tips on how to reduce this? Thanks x",

      "Content": "Hi there. I had surgery 2 weeks ago and had results appointment today; I too am now waiting radiotherapy and have appointment with that consultant early April.  I have been very clear from the start that I would not work until treatment (not including hormone meds) has finished.  Emotionally I don't believe that I would cope, nor physically due to the effects of emotions. Also, I don't believe that my job is the best to do whilst being treated for cancer (I work in palliative care). My GP has currently signed me off until towards the end of April but is willing to extend if needed, the current timeframe was agreed before my results appointment today. Xx",
