    "Content": "Hi, I'm day 6 into my first cycle FEC. To be honest i'm struggling with the psychological side of feeling very lethargic, also (don't know why) but i'm shocked how quickly I feel lethargic and listless. From normal energy to Zero !!!!  However my main question is please can someone give me advice about th generalised discomfort? Am I ok to take paracetamol, I have no temp or any other symptoms. I'm taking my anti sickness and Gaviscon tablets are my new besties lol.  #Knewthiswasn'tgoingtobeeasyBUTOMG!!!!",
