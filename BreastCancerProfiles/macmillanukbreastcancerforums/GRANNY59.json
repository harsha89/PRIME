      "Content": "Hi Connie1993 welcome to the forum. I am so very sorry to hear about all that has gone on for you and appalled at what is happening for you. Too young?????? How dare they if they have confirmed that you have that gene then you should be being offered options and not just told we will see you when you are 30. There are two  things you could do right away. 1) Make a complaint about the way you are being treated and how closed a mind your Oncologist has had with you. The hospital must have a complaints department and I would put pen to paper now and get that sent in.   2) You could contact the MacMillan Line in the am or until 8pm tonight and ask for their advice I feel sure they will be able to offer you some support to move this forward for you. Please keep in touch and let us know how you get on and we will be here for you as long as you need us to be. Meantime im sending you some huge big hugs. xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Addison welcome to the forum. Sometimes it has been known for Mammograms to not pick up things but as far as I know it is rare for that to happen. Breast Cancer doesn't always run in families I have none in mine either but still got it it doesn't discriminate unfortunately and often strikes when we least expect it and catches us on the back foot. Dropping the anger is good but you need to maybe drop also that search for 'why', because there isn't an answer and you will drive yourself mad looking for one and blame yourself for something that is so random none of us know which one of us it will strike and we have no control over.  They wont know many of the details until the area is out and sent to pathology who do the staging etc and then you will know exactly what you are dealing with and what treatment they are proposing for you. It sound to me like you are one feisty lady pushing them to re-scan and catching things as they did good on you for doing that many people don't always feel able to do that. It is a scarey time for you right now but we will be with you every step of the way so you wont go through any of this alone. Im not sure about the choice but its good that there was one as if they had thought it was so bad they would have opted right away for a full mastectomy so there is some positive in there. Please keep in touch and let us know how you get on as we will be thinking of you. Meantime Im sending you some huge big hugs. xxxxx",

However, that does not make it any easier to accept that things have changed when you probably had only begun to get your head around what has happened for you. Yes people can and do work when having chemo but we all react differently so you will need to play that one by ear and take each session as it comes. As you are about to start a  new job on Monday could I suggest that you make contact with the Macmillan Line as there are specific guidelines about Cancer and the workplace and these may be helpful for your new Managers and the Macmillan Line have  a welfare  tem who can advise you.

      "Content": "Hi Ginacarla an interesting topic and like you I have had the cipla brand a few times and they are awful for the side effects so you have my sympathy. I had asked a pharmacist colleague of mine why I couldnt get the same brand and she said that each chemist gets a delivery from a warehouse that uses a picker and so that meant that each chemist could in theory get a different brand so to ensure the same brand I would need to trail round about 10 pharmacies. So like you I have put up with god awful side effects for months now until recently when I had a strange experience. Hubby went to the chemist for me to pick up my prescription and phoned me to say that the pharmacist wanted to speak to me which I did. It said on my prescription I was to have the Accord brand but they were unable to get this and hadn't been for some time was there a brand that I preferred? Now that was a novelty!!! I have opted for TEVA  which they can get and have assured me that they will try their best to ensure I get this which I have for the last 2 times and I can tell you the side effects are definetely less and whilst still there nowhere near as debilitating.  I'm like you and have been told I could stop for a while but not keen to do that as I am not brave enough for that so just keep taking the pills. I wonder with all the comments on here if we could persuade Macmillan to help us to compile a letter to see if we can change this as as you say 10 years of this is not very encouraging? Sending very best wishes for now .xxxx",

It is interesting to know that a prescription for Paracetamol for example from a GP costs £35 to the NHS when they can be bought for under £1 in any supermarket.  Im in Scotland where we get free prescriptions but the same plans are afoot already. I do agree with you though that there should be exemptions to this but from what I can see and read that will be the case. However, as you say it will depend on the way this is interpreted by NHS TRusts etc . It always amazes me that NHS Trusts have to save millions of pounds and often able to do some of that which makes me wonder what were they spending the money on when they can afford to save all that money?

Your gp has done exactly the right thing in referring you to the breast clinic as that is where the knowledge and expertise that you need is. It could still be another fatty lump but you won't know unfortunately until you get to the breast clinic . Please stay OFF Google it is unreliable and if you feel anxious now that will only make you worse stay here where the info is reliable and the people at macmillan are great. If you wanted to talk to someone try the Macmillan phone line number on the bottom of this page they are great listeners. I sometimes wonder if our hubbbies take the head in the sand approach and convince themselves that it will be OK possibly because they are a wee bit anxious themselves.  The only thing I can say is try to keep busy it will make the time pass quicker and please keep in touch and let us know how you get on.

You will be sore and as you say this is to be expected but it doesn't always make it any easier to deal with so hope you are managing the pain with some form of pain relief for you? Its difficult to say what the back pain could  be it could be the way they have had you moved around in theatre or it could be that it is the way you are holding yourself and believe me when you are sore like like then we do hold ourselves differently to protect our sore breast. Alternatively it could be that maybe you are sleeping more on your back at the moment and again that's possible as you try to get a comfy sleeping position after the surgery. Maybe it's worth giving this a couple of days and if this isn't easing off then I would pop along to the GP and get them to check this out for you just to put your mind at rest. Hope the recovery goes well and look after yourself. Sending some huge big gentle hugs for now. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Tray46 and a sad but warm welcome to this forum. Sad because you have had to find us but welcome because we all know some of what will be happening for you right now. The size of your tumour would be a consideration I imagine as to whether you would have had a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. When all the results come back they are discussed by with a Multi Disciplinary Team and a plan is put together for you for any further treatment or none required and that is standard for us all. It sounds like the results were not all back hence the delay I imagine. That said it is probably better, but stressful I know to wait and then everything is back and a full picture can be put together for you. The waiting is the pits and none of us would tell you anything different I dont think, except to try as best you can to keep yourself busy until they do come back as you cant do anything in this time until they do. I appreciate what you husband is saying and most likely he is trying  to remain positive to keep you positive but Im not sure that you should be running back to work just yet as you have to recover from this big op and there are all sorts of feelings that go with what has happened for you as well.. Im not surprised you are upset the whole things sounds like it has come as a complete shock and you have had no time to get your head around what has happened for you. I assure you you are perfectly normal in that and  in time that will pass but for now you just need to take a day at a time and recover and get those results back and know exactly what they have said and then move forwards. I am under no illusion that my last sentence sounds simple but is not in any way simple and you have to take whatever time you need to feel better and not what others tell you you should do. There are lots of knowledgeable folks here on the forum and I feel sure that one of them will be along soon to offer some re-assurance for you and also to let you know that we are here for you whenever you need us to be.

As far as I remember they put a dye in before surgery and release this during surgery and it goes to the tumour as  a marker. They always test the Sentinel node first and again if I remember right if its not in that one then it hasnt gone to the lymph nodes at least thats how mine was. Like you I only have one wound and the next part will tell them the grade and stage of the lump and the node biopsy. This next bit is the pits waiting for the results the time seems to drag but it will be here before you know it.

The waiting is awful and your mind goes into overdrive and you havent even had time to process whats happened to you.. It may yet be something to do with breastfeeding and your gp is on the ball for you.  Its sinking in whats happened and so quickly its liek somebody has picked youi up in a tornado and you cant get back to get your feet onto the ground but you will.

You are not selfish at all  you have come to the right place to talk and get your thoughts out on print where others can see them and try to help. Now breathe!!!! Otherwise you will drive yourself mad. You are scared and thats normal when anyone fnds a lump but please remember that not all lumps are cancer and hopefully yours will turn out not to be that either. However, if it does turn out to be that then breast cancer is totally treatable nowadays and many people go on to lead full lives after treatment. Thiursday will seem like an age away for you but i will come round and your gp has done exactly the right thing in referring you as that is where the knowledge and expertise is that you need. try to keep busy it will make the time pass quicker and please stay OFF ggogle as that will scare you even more and it is not reliable. Others will be along soon aas well to offer reassurance for you and someone is always here so keep posting as you feel able and keep deep breathing to reduce the anxiety Thursday unfortunately wont come any quicker. Enjoy time with those children of yours and plesae keep in touch and let us know how you get on as we will be thinking of you.. Sendign huge big hugs.for you xxxx",

I get why you might think it would be best especially after your experience with chemo and of course no on can make the choice but you. Personally I took everything they threw at me to make this bloody cancer go away and stay away but everybody is different. please let in touch and let us know how you get on and sending big hugs for a speedy recovery for you xcx",

Its a bit of an individual thing which I imagine is not of much use in response to your question.  2 weeks post surgery is a bit early I think to be considering a job where it is physical as you are still healing from the op and this can take some time to get back to any degree of normality for you to be able to do your job. Does your company have any policy on how much sick leave you are allowed? If it was me I would take as much as you can as you will be tired and dependant on the outcome of the pathology from those lumps and lymph nodes will determine the treatment plan for you. Maye when you have that treatment plan you might be in a better position to know what kind of treatment you will need and the timeframes for this. Dont underestimate what your body has been through and may still have to go through with treatment. Take it easy while you can and if you need more time off than is ok for your company please give Macmillan Line a call as there are special rules governing people in the workplace and Cancer. 08088080000.

Im wondering rather than be upset/worried about this ,if you felt able to pick up the phone and have a chat with the Radiotherapy unit as they would probably be the best people to advise you regarding this. I don't know enough about this to answer with any useful information hence my suggestion that you ask them for further advice. Im wondering if you are able to let us know which supplements you are referring to as this may help others to answer.

However by me answering your post this will bump it up the list and hopefully someone  may be able to help with further information. If not I wonder if you might like to post in the Ask a Nurse section as they may have more access to relevant research which may be available re your query.

I didn't have a mastectomy mine was lumpectomy with node removal but personally I went for front opening nighties but that's just me I imagine front opening pj's would be ok as well. They may give you exercises to do after the surgery and its so important that you do these as they will help to get movement back in the arm. You may have  a drain in to start with immediately after the op but different hospitals seem to do different things so you may not have this but its a possibility.   I'm not sure that you will have a catheter in when you wake but you can ask them about this when you go in. Hubby taking some time off is a great idea as you can concentrate on your recovery and be totally pampered for  a week. It will depend on lots of different  variables as to if 1 week might be enough but as you say 1 week may be more than enough for you to deal with so maybe play that one by ear. I love the last bit about some support briefs- is that a just in case buy???  We are here for whenever you need us and I will be thinking of you. Sending some huge big hugs meantime. xxxxx",

The waiting is the pits because your mind goes into overdrive and you convince yourself of the worst case  scenario and many of us do this so your wife is not alone in that but keeping busy is the only way I found to distract myself from the waiting game. Please tell her if you can gently to stay OFF the internet it is unreliable and each persons cancer is different to the others so the treatment plan will be devised which is unique to your wife and no one else although there may be similarities in treatment. Newspapers are designed to grab the headlines and sell plenty of newspapers and they often report on only the worst case scenarios but there are many many positive and good stoiries that never make the newspapers as they dont sell the newspapers the same. It is likely to be a rough few days for you both until Thursday comes but once you have the results you will have a treatment plan put in place and then you will know for certain exactly what you are both dealing with. Maybe for now its about keeping your wife busy and giving her plenty of hugs. Meantime I think you could do with some hugs as well so sending some for you xxxxxx",

Seromas can fill up really quickly and can be problematic especially in the early days after surgery and lymph node removal. Do you have a breast nurse that you can call at all? If so I would give them a  call and ask if someone can have a look at this lump for you it could be related to the surgery or another small seroma forming but until someone sees that and has a look you are not going to know that for certain. This would at least put your mind at rest. Please let us know how you get on and thinking of you. Sending some huge big hugs. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

It can be really hard cant it making choices and it would be so easy for us if  others made them for us but we both know thats not how it works and unfortunately it has to be down to us in the end. Have you mentioned how you arm feels after the SNB this may be cording which can be troublesome but fixable  I developed Lymphodema in my breast after the SNB but now being treated for that and it is working to kick this old Lymph system of mine back into full operation. I imagine it is always a risk after this type of surgery but many people dont get get it and some do so no definitive answer to that one. The issue with the lymph nodes is complex and thats why they will be wanting to remove them to improve the chances of completely eradicating this disease for you. There is not right or wrong answer but you need to make the decision that gives you the best chance of beating this disease and none of us ever get any guarantees of recurrence it is something we all  fear but have to learn to live with and never lose hope.

I think we all have that fear and I'm not sure that it ever truly leaves is but most of the time these things are totally unconnected and turn out to be nothing to worry about hence why I think a trip to the GP to get some medical advice would be worth ti if even just to put your mind at rest.  Please come back and let us know how you get on and Im sure some hugs wouldn't go amiss so sending some huge big hugs your way for now. xxxx.",

I like you have to be grateful for the screening programme I was certainly a bit older than you when picked up but I wouldn't have known there was anything wrong as I couldn't feel anything but a lump there was and yes it was Breast Cancer but hey I am a 18 months down the line and I am still here causing untold mischief and getting on with life as best I can. The lump that you may feel could be internal swelling and bruising if you think whats on the outside of us then think what the inside this could also  be some scar tissue forming around the area and this can feel lumpy as well so most likely to be that rather than anything growing as you are thinking.  Are you taking someone with you when you go to get these results? It is recommended that you do and believe me when I tell you that it is so worthwhile as often you may be so anxious and naturally so that you don't take everything in that they are saying but the other person can often remember  things that you don't..  Hope all goes well for you at the results appointment  and we will be here for you every step of the way if it turns out to be what they think to could be.

      "Content": "Hi Roche welcome to the forum you are right in what you say when you say what  a year you have had. First of all 3 weeks ago fr your op and going for radiotherapy is not a long time for you not just to heal physically but emotionally and mentally as well and that part can take  a bit longer. If you are able to take more time off then if i was me I would as you say yourself you are not sure if you are ready and whilst maybe going back would be a good thing in that it would keep your mind occupied, in another way it pulls you down as well as trying to deal with ongoing treatment. Only you can make that call unfortunately. How long does it take to heal? Well there is a question if ever there was One? How long is a piece of string is the answer. We all heal differently physically but the mental recovery from Cancer can affect us all in different ways and sometimes thats the bit that takes the longest. Dont push your self too hard you need to take whatever time you feel that you need. This beast of a disease comes into our lives completetly uninvited, turns our lives upside down then leaves we hope for ever. The lasting impression it leaves on us though is harder to deal with sometimes and again we all deal with that differently. Your body is telling you that you need to rest as you are so tired so listen to your body and your own thoughts and do whats best for you.  Meantime Im sending some huge big hugs for you.xxxxxxx",

It is completely understandable that you fear that it might be back but I'm not aware that any of those symptoms you describe are related to breast cancer at the start. What you are describing sounds like menopausal symptoms and the flushes and dryness are both common when they shut off our oestrogen. I wonder if it would be wise to make a trip to the Gp to discuss all this as there are others meds that can be given although I think most of them have similar symptoms but maybe worth a try xxxx sending some big cooling hugs xxxxx",

I don't know if there is such a thing I'm not very good with insertING links but I'm sure one of the lovely ladies on here might be able to its an article by a psychologist about life after cancer and I'm sure you will resonate with everything he says. Cancer changes us all somewhat I think and we are never quite the same but often that's a positive thing because you start to focus on you your life and what's important to you and all the other crap that life throughs up at us becomes pretty unimportant in the big scheme of things. You will find the path that is right for you believe me you will but it will take time so don't be too hard on yourself cut yourself some slack and celebrate being a strong woman who has  survived cancer and if you can get through that you can survive anything. there is always somebody here to listen so please keep in touch and sending huge big hugs for you xxx",

I have been having something similar and was on an Oestrogen based vaginal cream prior to the breast surgery and mine was er+ as well so cant use that now but the Nurse Specialist I saw has given me something else to try. Do you still have contact with anyone at the breast unit as they could maybe help with this if you discussed this with them I am sure they will have heard of this happening many times. Alternatively you could post your question in Ask the Nurse on the site as they may be able to answer with more details than I can. Its not nice bit it is related to our Oestrogen being switched off by the meds so dont put up with it see if you can see a lady GP and have a discussion with them. They may want to examine you just to rule out any cervix issues prior to putting you on anything. Hope you get it sorted out, x",

In answer to your question I think we are all different and some experience fatigue and some of us dont its not an easy one to advise about. You will know it when it comes if it does because it will take the feet from you and you will feel as someone has pulled the plug out of the socket. If that happens listen to your body and rest as much as you can as this will be helpful in managing any fatigue. Drink plenty of water before and after the treatment as this helps to keep you hydrated.  If you are able to and need to take some time off work and rest this takes its toll on your body and can take upward of a year for us to get back to any degree of normality whatever normality is. Good luck with the rest of the treatment and please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. Meantime Im sending you some huge big hugs. xxxx",

You have had your mammogram and biopsies have been taken so there is no way of knowing what type of breast cancer you may have if indeed it does turn out to be breast cancer until those biopsies are back. You seem to be asking about mastectomies when the diagnosis is not yet known and you may be scaring yourself even more and  I completetly get that you are anxious and this is normal for us all at this stage. The only thing you can do at this point is wait until the results are in and then we will be here to support you in anyway we can but please stay OFF google it is unreliable and not indiviudalised enough and likely to scare you even more. I hope Im not sounding negative as I dont mean to be but I can tell you are scared and thats ok. Dont put anything into your head until you have had the results and you know exactly what you may be dealing with and we will be here with you and for you every step of the way.

You are doing the right thing though going to the GP and you are right in that they will possibly want you seen at the Breast Clinic. You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel nervous and past history is taking you to the bad place but again any of would feel the same and as you say this could well turn out yet to be nothing to worry about.  I wish I could say something to you to make any of this any better but you know the drill and tomorrow is the start of the process seeing the GP and getting expertly checked out. Will be thinking of you tomorrow and do please keep in touch and let us know how you get on as we will be thinking of you.

Ah the keeping busy stage well the best thing to do is keep so busy with different things that you don't have time to dwell on any of it and when you go to bed you are so tired that you have to sleep. My house was begging me by the end of the waiting period to leave it alone as it was cleaned to within an inch of its life. There isn't an easy answer unfortunately but its ok to feel upset and scream and shout at the unfairness of everything  as much as you like. When you go to any of the posts there should be  a blue reply button and you just press that and start typing and then press send . If you want to start a new conversation at the top of the main page there should be wording that says \"start a new conversation\" and you press on that put a title in the heading ,start typing, then press post and your post should come up.  its ok to have a practice we are not in the least formal on here and as I said we are here for you every step of the way so keep in touch and keep super busy. When that thought comes into your head get up and do something and hopefully it will go away. Forgot to say that there is an awake thread in the Breast Cancer forum for the night owls so if you cant sleep and want to chat just go on there awake thread Just press the link I have included and it will take you straight there.

The Radiotherapy should be ok although it can make you very tired but that doesnt happen for everyone and you dont actually feel anything with Radiotherapy. It can affect the skin being treated though so look out for any redness and tell them right away. I hope that you get back to living life as before but I often wonder if any of us are every the same after Cancer it changes us in ways that we hadnt expected and leaves us thinking and feeling differently about things . I cant comment about Tamoxifen as I am on Letrozole but they do have their own side effects as well but all manageable and the folks on here have lots of tips and ideas about managing the side effects and I feel sure they will share these willingly with you.

I know it may feel like a long time for you but 15 days is not really that long for the recovery and especially if you have a haematoma. It will go down but it will take time to do that. My friend has had a haematoma from a biopsy from her breast and it is only now going down after 4 weeks. Have you tried an  ice pack to see if that helps take some of the achy part out of it. If any of it gets hot or red you need to see the Nurse as that can be an indicator of infection. It is early days yet for you so take it easy and keep doing the exercises they gave you as this will help ensure that your arm regains full movement. In the meantime Im sending you some gentle hugs. xxxx",

I remember mine hit me at exactly the same point as you that said you are a good deal younger than me but it is not pleasant and takes the feet from you. I'm not surprised that you are exhausted after all that you have been through your poor body has taken some beating and it will take as long for it to recover again. I think we all get tired when we have periods and add that to having radiotherapy at the same time and your whole body is being bombarded. Are you able to take any more time off until your Radiotherapy is completed? The reason I ask is that it can take it out of you and keeping ploughing through can lower your immune system at a time when you need it in tip top form and that leaves us open to silly bugs etc especially in the workplace. I think it is fatigue and all I can suggest is that you rest as much as you can and listen to your body and relax. The other thing to do is maybe ask when you go for your next Radiotherapy session I feel sure they will be well used with answering this question and can hopefully offer you some re-assurance. Drinking plenty of water before and after treatment helps a little as well. Meantime Im sending you some huge big hugs. xxxxxxxx",

I noted that you had not had a reply so by me replying this bumps it up the ladder a bit and hopefully others will see this and respond with some advice for you. Like you Ludo mine was Lobular breast Cancer as well and like you I had all sorts of weird and wonderful sensations in the breast for at least a year after treatment ended but I am assured that this can be the case and that it is the nerves all healing and they dont always tell you that stuff so it is worrying. Im glad that you have been checked out and they cant feel anything but maybe they could do an ultrasound to see if there is anything there or if it is just healing maybe you could ask about that. In terms of bone scans I have one every year but not to check for Cancer but to check for any signs of  Osteoporosis as I am on Letrozole and that is known to have some of these issues for our bones. I'm not sure if that is of any help but I feel,sure some of the other lovely folks on here will be along soon to share experiences and hopefully offer you some reassurance.  Meantime Im sending some much needed huge big hugs for you. xxxxxx",

My response is in response to you saying you have found some pea sized lumps and think this is cysts. Well I agree, that this could be cysts but what is vital here is that you make  a GP appointment right away and get this checked out and it may be that they refer you further to the breast clinic and whist that might sound scarey they are the people that will tell you whether that is cysts or not after some tests.and full examination for you. My understanding of the Mammograms is that for the screening programme these start at aged  50. I am lead to believe that this is because the breast tissue at that age is less dense than when we are all younger but I'm sure some of the other lovely folks on here will pop along soon with some further advice.. However please do pick up that phone and make a GP appointment to get those lumps checked out by a medical professional.   Please come back and let us know how you get on.

I dont believe that there is such a thing as a typical breast cancer lump they can be other things and the only way to know for certain is to go to the breast clinic and for biopsies to be taken if that is felt neccessary. I wish I could say something to reassure you but it really is a waiting game unfortunately until you get to the breast clinic. It is a difficult and scarey time for you and the waiting is the worst. Pleaase stay OFF google it is unreliable and not accurate as breast cancer is very individualised and google is very general. I hope it turns out to be something other than breast cancer but if it is it is treatable and many people go on to live fulfillig long lives. It could be lots of things though before that. Please keep in touch and let us know how you are gettign on and please feel free to keep talking if it helps there is always someone around. Sendign huge big hugs for you. xxx    ",

You have done exactly the right thing going to the GP and they as you will know have done exactly the right thing sending you to the breast clinic.

The waiting is the pits though and I completely get that. This could be anything  and it could be scar tissue or a lymph node if you have any there now?

      "Content": "Ho Sheppy529 welcome to the forum.                             I can't actually believe what they have said to you what a cheek they have got telling you to just wait longer don't they understand the term fast track? There are targets they havex to meet for referrals to breast clinics and it might be worth finding out about these also maybe your gp could intervene on your behalf. Either way being overstretched is not your responsibility and if it was me I would keep phoning them until I got an appointment. This is your life not theirs time to get assertive and tough methinks. please keep in touch and let us know how you get on . sending very best wishes xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Charlene70 welcome to the forum. The drugs you refer to are of the same kind of drugs designed to shut off oestrogen production. To my knowledge Tamoxifen is prescribed for women who are pre menopausal and letrozle for women who are post menopausal. I suspect that both drugs will have similar side effects and none of them are very nice but when your tumour is oestrogen positive Im too afraid not to take them but I think it is an individual decision possibly in discssuion with your Oncologist or breast nurse. Please let us know how you get on and what you decide..Sending you some hugs in the meantime. xx",

I think we all live with it and deal with it in different ways and I dont know if it ever truly leaves us.. You are allowed though to have down days and a good cry bt it sounds liek you are confident of picking yourself up dusting yourself down and starting all over again so thats good. (I can feel a song coming on with those last words but I will restrain myself) Hope you feel better soon and remember you are a survivor dont let cancer steal anymore of your life than it already has. Here are some hugs to brighten your day xxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Oks welcome to the forum. I am so very sorry to hear about the problems that you are experiencing. Well done for getting through the surgery at least one part is past for you. Seromas often form after surgery and can take some weeks to rectify themselves and can often need draining unfortunately but they do eventually stop and then you can begin to heal fully. It is common to take the drains out at the time that they have but sometimes they leave them in for a bit longer but all areas seem to  be different with this. I am hopeful that maybe one of the lovely ladies on the Breast Cancer forum may be able to offer more advice re this for you and they will be along soon. Meantime Im sending some huge big gentle hugs your way.xxxx",

Please don't compare yourself to anyone else as we are all different and all respond differently if we didn't nobody would have any need for a forum such as this where they can post concerns and get help. It does sound that despite all the pain you have that your team are being very thorough and doing a full check of everything before they write to you or see you which is positive. Waiting for the results is the pits the waiting takes its toll on us and can and does affect your mood so you are not alone there. I hope you get the results soon and please keep in touch and let us know how you get on. sending you some huge big hugs for now xxxxx",

It may be to do with treatment etc but it is always wise I think to get this checked out with your GP. If you are able to get an appointment with them then it might be worth doing that if only to offer you some re-assurance. Sorry to not have been of much help but please let us know how you get on, Sending very best wishes. x ",

      "Content": "Hi Jessief04 first things first welcome to the forum you have come to the right place for support and chat while you wait for that appointment. The fast track is put in place for the breast referrals and this is a standard target that is set by Governements. So that may explaine the quickness of the appointment. It sounds like the GP has written the letter and said what they suspect but they have to always suspect Cancer with lumps until proven otherwise so that may just be them being cautious. That said you are going to exactly the right place at the breast clinic as that is where the knowledge and expertise is that you need to determine exactly what those lumps are. Bringing someone with you is also advised as there may be lots of bits of info to take in so two sets of ears are better than one and If you are like the rest of us at these appointments you may be anxious and not take in all that was said perfectly understandable given where we are. If and it is a big if. If it is  Breast cancer it  is very treatable today and there is no reason to suppose that you will not see your children grow up in fact no reason to suppose that you wont be dancing at their weddings or cuddling your grandchidren. Its a scarey time right now for you all but just come on here anytime and get as much support as you need to get you through to that appoinrment. Please stay away from Google it is unrealiable and not indiviudlaised enough. Hang in there and sending you some huge big hugs for now xxxxxxxxxx",

If it helps to reassure you a lot of the feeling you are experiencing are normal for many of us but not nice just the same.  Yes you can be referred for Counselling and maybe your GP could do this for you or if you have a local Maggies Centre they may be able to offer this for you as well. There is an article by a Psychologist a Dr Peter Harvey and if you type in the name on the internet you will be able to read his artiicle and if you are anything like me you may recognise yourself in there and cut yourself some slack for the feelings you are having.
