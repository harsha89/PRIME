    "Content": "It's very simple to treat this. You'll get eye drops and a cream, and within a few days you'll be rid of it. I've had this 3 times this year. The last time, I knew I'd soon see a cyst, a day before it appeared and I didn't bother seeing a doctor as I already had the treatment at home. There are home remedies that may help. Heating the area helps a lot. It may sound odd, but really helps, I put a hard boiled egg, warm but not too warm on the eye and rolled it around the eye for a while, while laying down with eyes closed. I hope this helps",
