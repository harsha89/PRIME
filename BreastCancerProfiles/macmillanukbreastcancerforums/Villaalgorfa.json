      "Content": "Hi jane I searched zoladex and exemestane and found you! I know you posted two years but wondered if you had any advise, I have been on these drugs since April and all of a sudden in July I became very achy.  All my joints are painful and I become very stiff. I swim go to the gym and attend yoga classes.  I\u2019ve been taking glucosamine since August but have noticed no improvement. Did you or do you still suffer with joint pains?  I hope you are well, anita ",

      "Content": "Thanks. I have been reading people\u2019s posts all year now and find it very comforting.  Family and friends have been amazing but they just don\u2019t understand. When you feel like you can move on something else hits you and with me it\u2019s the painful  bones and joints - I feel 90! I am swimming and going to yoga which helps but it\u2019s when you stop and sit still!  I had grade 2 stage 2 with an oncotype score of 20 so avoided chemo (I\u2019m 49). I hope the chemo goes well fir you and let us know which drugs you end up on and how you\u2019re doing. Xx",
