      "Content": "Hi Lynne. I had the oncotype test done a few weeks ago, got the call last week that my Oncotype score was a 7. My oncologist said there would be no benefit to me having chemo. I still havent met up with him yet to go through exactly what the number means in terms of reoccurance odds though so if anyone has any insight on that, it would be really useful to share. Katie x",

      "Content": "I am hoping others have had a similar sort of experience. I found out 5 weeks ago I had breast cancer, was told it was 7mm IDC. Treatment would be lumpectomy, rads, Tamoxifen. After first lumpectomy results came back, 5mm IDC with 2cm of DCIS in surrounding area. DCIS was low/intermediate grade and tumour was in fact grade 1 stage 1. They also found a tiny 1.2mm drop inside one of my lymph nodes. Only issue from my consultants point of view was that the margins werent clean so further lumpectomy was required. second lumpectomy results came back - margins still werent clean (DCIS left behind). Now i am scheduled in for a mastectomy tomorrow, just on that breast. I had an MRI Friday and am worried that something will show in the other breast too. I have had a mammogram and ultrasound but i have heard so many stories of things being missed, misdiagnosis etc. I am so nervous and thinking the absolute worst. I am 31 years old and thought i was coping okay but it seems everything i thought would happen has changed so much in such a short space of time. anyone with similar stories please get in touch. katie x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Unfortunately the MRI revealed another tumour on the other side of the same breast (that was removed yesterday with the mastectomy). I am beyond devastated. It's more than twice the size of the original tumour. I am now back at square one, waiting for original diagnosis. Every time I go back to see my consultant the news gets worse. I am at my breaking point....",

      "Content": "Hi Julia No I am home now. I only stayed in overnight for the mastectomy. I am feeling horrendous today, my stomach is in agony I think it's to do with all the medication they have given me. Constant shooting pains starting from the pit of my stomach and shooting all the way up. So painful and I have barely slept.  I am so upset that they found the other tumour 5 weeks ago, and it has taken this long to find the second. I had even had an oncotype test on the original tumour, which had come back as a score of 7 so I was told no chemo was necessary. Now all of the previous results and tests are obsolete. I have gone 5 steps forward and 10 steps back.  Thanks for your kind words. Katie x",
