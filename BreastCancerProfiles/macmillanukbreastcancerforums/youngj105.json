      "Content": "If you use Facebook there is a really good group you might like to join, they can probably give you any information you might need. It is based in the US but has members from all over the world and some excellent links to research articles etc.  The address is www.facebook.com/groups/BeyondthePinkMoon There is also a book, available on Amazon, The Pink Moon Lovelies, Empowering Stories of Survival. It contains the stories of 50 women from around the world who are breast and/or ovarian cancer survivors and also previvors (people who have been found to have the BRCA gene mutation).  My story is included in the book. I also run a support group on Facebook for ladies with, or caring for, someone with breast cancer. You can message me on my personal profile, www.facebook.com/jill.young.7330 There is plenty of information and help out there, I hope you find the information you need. x",

      "Content": "If there are any ladies who, either have breast cancer, or are caring for someone with breast cancer and would like somewhere more private to find support I run a support group on Facebook. It is a 'secret' group so is very private. We have currently 138 ladies from across the world as members. If you would like to join this is the link to my profile where you can message me requesting to join. www.facebook.com/jill.young.7330 ",

The group is absolutely private, I cannot even post a link to it because of it being a 'secret' group. You can only join the group if a friend adds you so if you would like to join please send me a friend request. Jill",
