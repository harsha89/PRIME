    "Content": "Hi everyone.  I'm on a bit of an information hunt -  so if any of you can help,  it would be much appreciated.  My mum has secondary breast cancer. It's now in her bones,  scalp,  etc She is currently on Megace as her cancer is hormone receptive.  However,  we are having problems in sourcing it from her pharmacy.  We've asked all over our region and it seems to be all out of supplies.  Is anyone else experiencing this problem or is it a big administrative error in our part of the world?  And to offer a bit of hope to you all -  she was first diagnosed with breast cancer nearly 30 years ago.  With prompt treatment,  regular discussions,  lots of trials of different treatments  -  we've all made it through.    Keep the faith everyone and look after yourselves.  Thanks all! ",
