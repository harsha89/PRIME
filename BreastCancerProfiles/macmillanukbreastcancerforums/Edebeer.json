      "Content": "Hello there. My name is Ettienne and my wife Tricia was diagnosed with Grade 3 invasive breast cancer. It was a terribly hard journey for her, as I am sure you can appreciate. So many things went wrong, from implants to nearly dying of under anaesthetics, countless appointments, endless waiting, and horrid treatments, FEC100, Taxotere, radiotherapy, Herceptin and on and on.    I thought that I did the best I could at the time and after all, what I call our Fire-Walk, we sat down and reflected on how we got through this together. So we decided that we would like to help ladies (and men)  in the future having more meaningful support from their loved ones, especially their partners.   We are almost complete with a \"how to book\" for partners and friends that we hope will change the process and journey for future ladies to a more holistic supportive environment where we draw our strength from, at home. It is for this reason that I am in this sacred space looking for any topic that we have not covered in our book and that you may feel was valuable to you in your journey.  I'd like to know if anybody would be so kind as to give me some advice and suggestions as to what a man can do to be valuable to his partner during breast cancer.  What are the best things to do and not to do so that you feel completely supported and that you both can learn and come out the other end stronger? Together we can and must help the future cope better with this \"Fire-Walk\" Thank you for your time. Kind Regards",

      "Content": "Dear Flopsyuk. Thank you for your message and concerns raised, I appreciate your openness and honesty. It is not my intention to advocate any spiritual remedies. My response was intended to agree with Optismistic that the emotional aspect of treatment can still be observed even when a complete life change has been adopted.  When I mentioned that my wife changed her complete life outlook never having to deal with this disease again, I realise that I should have said, never having to deal with the potential of this disease again in the same way. Things such a yoga have benefited my wife by relaxing her muscle tone in her arms, chest and back, it has also allowed her to focus on deep breathing which has helped lowering stress and enabled her better sleep. I do not pretend nor do I profess that yoga can or will heal cancer, however it is a wonderful tool we both could do together with markable benefits to our relationship.  This book is not about projecting our beliefs and values onto others. The intention of this book is to offer partners of women who are affected by BC a whole range of experiences that were helpful during the journey. Its contents are mainly our own experience and reflection afterwards on how we could have made the journey healthier for both of us. It is for this reason that I am appealing to you for the valuable input so that we can help future couples through this journey. Again thank you for your message and I hope that your journey is filled with many blessings. Kind Regards Namaste.",

It was only later that we discovered open conversation about fear, anxiety and roles, and as you've said we had no experience but knowing what we know now would have spared much loneliness in fear and anxiety for us both.  It is very helpful to be reminded that open conversation is an essential part of the journey. Hope you stay happy and blessed. Namaste.",
