      "Content": "Jo.   Hello.  I read your blog.  I was diagnosed on 8th Augus, had biopsies taken from breast and suspicious lymph node on the 11th. Got the results on the 22nd of August.   Grade 3 IDC with lymph node involvement.  Initially I was told HER 2+ although was told they would be doing further testinG. I am borderline positive for Estrogen.    Then I went for lots of staging scans, tiny spot found on liver but too small to say for definite what it is.  Going to have it rescanned with the hope it stays the same and doesn't respond to treatment as that would confirm spread.   So I was due to start fec-t on September 14th but ejection fraction results were low.  So has heart echo and repeat ecg.  Results came back better but onc thinks tch will be best plaN.   So. Hopes to start tch last week but then got word that I needed to go for kidney function tests with the radioactive dye.   So I had that yesterday so fingers crossed the resujts are fine.  On Monday I went for mammogram and ultrasound to confirm baseline before chemo. However new tumour areas were found so I got more core biopsies.  Hoping it's scabbed up enough for chemo which o hope will finally start tomorrow.  I never expected things to go smoothly but it's been one thing after another.  From the initial 5 week wait for my urgent referral. - I went private for initial consultation which meant I was seen on the 8th of August instead of the 30th.  My breast hurts everyday.  Every day it changes shape and I have watched my nipple all but disappear.  I had to stop my anxiety meds as they may have affected my heart results.  I was started on tamoxifen two weeks ago to try and slow down the tumour growth till chemo starts so I am blaming that on my grumpiness.   I am a lone parent to an 11 and 12 year old.  I am getting tired of being strong and I just want someone to tell me it's going to be ok.    I am deep cleaning my house again today in anticipation of starting chemo tomorrow.   My sons break off on school holidays tomorrow for two weeks (we are in Scotlan) and although glad we don't have to get up for the school routine  I am scared of the side effects.  I know you will all understand.     I am feeling very sorry for myself today.   I will have a good cry though and get it out and feel better after.  X",

And all being well I finish on the 19th Of jan.  I had my mid way ultrasound in November and I am responding well to the chemk. One of my breast tumours has dissapeared all together and the other which was the biggest is shrinking in all directions.  it has been suggested that I will have a single mastectomy in February and full lymph node removal.  My tumours were affecting the skin and also one was right behind my nipple hence the suggestion of a full mastectomy.   At the moment i don\u2019t want any reconstruction butvwill listen to what the surgeon has to say.  I am having full node removal as a biopsy at my initial diagnosis showed lymph involvement.  I have a holiday booked to Turkey at the beginning of June and my team want to make sure I am finished this treatment to go.  If they removed some lymph nodes there is a chance I would get recalled for further surgery which would likely interfere with the holiday.   I may get radiotherapy too, guess it depends on the pathology. i was sadly also diagnosed with a secondary met in my liver.  Had been a suspicious area from the staging scans but too small to be sure.  The mid way scans showed that this are had too shrunk with the chemo which means it\u2019s cancer.  I am hopeful it continues to shrink as my team have a plan for me.  So in them I trust.   I am devastated and scared but not letting the worries about tomorrow steal my joy from today.  I have every intention of being around as long as I can for my children.   Take care  x",
