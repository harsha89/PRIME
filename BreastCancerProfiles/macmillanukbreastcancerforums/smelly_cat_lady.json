Don't wait for someone to explain or try to remember later to ask, try and ask why when you're told things or they will weigh on your mind. That's why I took my husband to every appointment (and continue to do so) All is not lost, you can still have a coil fitted but it has to be a normal one, not one that is hormone impregnated like the mirena. How old are you? Have you discussed the possibility of early menopause?",

I have only been taking it a few months and haven't seen any obvious effects on our relationship so I wonder what exactly is going on with you as you don't give much detail. I was talking to my doctor yesterday and he was explaining that the side effects are similar to menopause (I am in my 40's) and it's difficult to tel the 2 apart. That would explain the mood swings and the hot flushes. All I can tell you from my side is that don't take it personally, we still love you and want you around, it's just hard when your mind is all over the place! My husband would probably tell you to retreat to your shed! I have read some advice on here suggesting evening primrose oil, starflower oil etc but maybe your wife should see her GP? Anyway, good luck x",

Now the good weather is here, I have been going 'alfresco' and even sported the shiny pate look at a top notch restaurant at a special occasion on Weds night. People are very accepting and I have got to the point now where I think if someone stares then thats their problem, not mine. Have just noticed that ny eyebrows have nearly vanished but reckon I can draw them in if I need to, aftrerall if the Duchess of Cambridge can wear the look ......! I was more upset than I thought I would be but I feel the same as one of the other ladies, it's just another thing to tick off the list, it won't last forever and it's a new experience. I particularly like standing under the shower and listening to rain drops keep falling on my head..........!",

It really came in handy when the canvassers were out for the local elections, you've never seen a clip board disappear so fast when I answered the door!!

How many times you're asked he most ridiculous questions and how annoying it must be when patients think they are the only person in the world that has cancer??!These people have lives and families to hold together as well as treating some of the most seriously ill patients in the hospital. Why don't you stop and consider how lucky you are to be able to tap into the fantastic resource that is the NHS? And it's free! Why don't you stop and consider how much this treatment would cost you in the states or how you would be treated in a 3rd world country? Yes, I know that doesn't excuse poor customer service but have a heart! I'm quite ashamed of some of the pathetic whinging on here!

I bought some coming back from Singapore and it really helped to re-establish my sleep patterns. You also need to have a 'go to bed' routine, which tells your body that it's time to sleep and can start to wind down. Turn the tv off, have a nice warm drink and make sure your bedroom is well ventilated and dark. Try and go at the same time every night even if your eyes are drooping and Mr Sandman has already made a delivery and if possible don't kip in the daytime. Works for me :0) Personally I would avoid too many strong sedatives as doctors seems to be all too keen to write a script without finding out the real cause of your distress. Still, you can always sell your temazepam on a street corner when you're down at the supermarket in your jamas at 3am! Good luck!",

      "Content": "NG, I found your post very difficult to read and have found many similar on this site to be very depressing. I admire the way in which you have recognised your own health issues and by confronting them are dealing with them well. I am touched by your concern for your mother, have you thought of telling her how much you care for her in general and as you say, what upsets her, upsets you. Some people are 'fixers' and feel that they need to mend or fix a situation when all we need is a friendly ear and compassion, just talking sometimes can make you feel better. Perhaps you have other family members or close friends that could help shoulder the burden and don't be afraid to ask, I have found that help can come from the most unexpected quarters! Even the smallest gesture can speak volumes. An offer to cook for me recently really raised my spirits. Having breast cancer is not a death sentence, it's a reason to live and although your mother's prognosis sounds grim, please try to look on the postitive side. You will find on this forum (within the gloom and doom) some very good advice and some occasional hilarious nuggets of humour. It's a very supportive community and you are never alone. Good luck x",
