Blood tests today were not good enough, so I go back for more tests tomorrow but I should be ok to start on Weds, apparently.  I played a gig at a local festival yesterday and felt so good!  I'm hoping SEs can be managed with good meds and I can still play at least some music. Good luck to everyone having chemo this week - each day is a step closer to the finish line... Angie x",

Has anyone had a radioactive isotope heart scan for Herceptin heart monitoring?  Apart from sounding like something from a sic-fi movie, what is it like? Onwards and upwards, ladies another day has almost finished. Love and hugs Angie x",

It's so hard not to feel as if we are being vain, but we have had a tough deal with BC, and our appearance is the most obvious sign of it. Feeling good about ourselves matters in so many ways and we have to love ourselves and be proud that we have got through some nasty procedures and treatments.   I hope you had a happy birthday, Tilly, despite feeling as you do.  I found myself feeling very emotional on my birthday, but had to keep smiling for the family or we would have all ended up in a weeping heap on the floor.  Me and my lot are not great at sharing difficult feelings but we are good at looking after each other so I did get some lovely treats and could enjoy my birthday meal with hardly any chemo taste in my mouth!  ",

Then day 10 I had no energy whatsoever and spent the day sleeping and sitting in bed not even reading or knitting but watching the storms... Feeling much more myself today and yesterday and helped hubby strip the lounge wallpaper for an hour.  My hair is very thin now an dI am waiting for it to disappear altogether later this week.  I don't go out without my new hat which I am very pleased with (Claire's Accessories, sale bargain!) and will get going with the wig when I visit my grand-daughter later this week.
