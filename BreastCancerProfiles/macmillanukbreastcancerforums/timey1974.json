      "Content": "sorry if this is the wrong group to post on but my wife has just had her first chemo last week and i want to be prepared and look after her as much as possible for when her hair falls out. Is there anything people on this forum can recommend to look after the scalp once the hair is gone. Is using something like Johnson baby oil advisableÂ ?? Any advice on products, remedies etc would be very much appreciated",
