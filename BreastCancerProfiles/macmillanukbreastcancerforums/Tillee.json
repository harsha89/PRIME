    "Content": "Hi You are definitely not alone! I have had a very similar experience...mastectomy two months ago currently having hormone treatments and radio therapy. I have had no reconstruction so that's the only difference, I'm 47 now.  I read your post with interest as to how I may feel one year on. All in all the same worries! But the positives were reassuring. It seems that you have more positive days now, I hope so anyway  X",
