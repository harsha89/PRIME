      "Content": "My \"waterproof\" stri strips fell off yesterday under my arm. Don't know where they are! Lol same place as my winter hats probably (searched  whole house can't find 3 hats and fingerless gloves).  I was in the bath with the dog. Ok so here is the laugh! Decided my not so white dog need a bath last night. Managed to lift her in but could not lean over to wash her! Stripped off and got in with her! Expecting my daughters to come home and find us but no! I'd left the key in the lock! One was sat outside for 15 mins messaging me! They were both banging on the door as i came back downstairs. So daughters not happy I lifted the dog and were locked out and dog not happy cause she hates having a bath.  And i still haven't found my steri strips! Post op check tomorrow and top of scar looks like it has been infected. Results too. So slightly worried. Fed up of being told what to do when. As I'm on my own to tonight I'm going to sit in bed with me boobs out! Massage my cording in the old arm pit and watch episodes of Castle! My life my way. Getting my mojo back!  Shirl I hope your mojo bounces back to you. It's bloody hard I know but we can and will deal with this!  Soft squishey hugs K x",

      "Content": "Glad it went well.  I have the house to myself tonight for the first time since my op 2 weeks ago. Just me and the dog. Soo looking forward to it! Daughters and boyfried have been great. But I can do things now and they needed to be told they can acknowledge off a bit !  Appointment tomorrow to find out how many \"several\" nodes means and hopefully that they got all of Barry out! They certain hand trouble finding him to put the wire in. I was almost late for my own op!  Wasn' warned about the gurgling noises my boob made after so that was a bit of a shock!! Hilarious as we were all listening for it to do it again!! Rest, take as much pampering as you can get but do your exercises!  I started them before the op and have very good mobility but still have some cording going on!  X",

      "Content": "Hi  I've just started having had 2 sessions out of 20. When I had my scan to. Measure me up they said I'd need to be redone for the booster sessions. So Friday I'm half undressed for a scan when the onc came in and said no its ok I'm going to calculate it all from the clips! Apparently when they take the lump.out they put clips around the border.  The booster bit is calculated to hit these borders! Where as the first radiotherapy is a more blanketing coverage. Although 52 I was told I have \"young dense breasts\" so this is why. You'e got to love some of these doctors when they tell you that!  I've been practicing having my hand above my head for about 15 mins and would recommend it. Although the it' still uncomfortable it' better than it could be! Good luck   K x",

      "Content": "Hi All! I've not kept horses through this but have had a dog who sleeps on the bed with me and loved to lick my bald head! I'm the one who picked up in  the garden after her too.  Yes you could pick up an Infection but you could also not if you are careful. She is now so excited that we can go out for walks again. When I put any sort of head covering  on she expects to go out! I do Rainbows and brownies and didn't pick up a thing from them during chemo. Parents were really good at keeping sick girls away. However just getting over my op and because I'd let my guard down my OWN daughter gave me a cold form hell!! 3 days in bed plus 2 weeks of sniffles! Back on the cats claw for me then!  It's your life and your cancer only you can decide if you can deal with horses and dogs. I did get to a point where I felt I was being told what to do all the time. Had a hissy fit and decided it's my life everyone else can deal with it!  Go with you gut. But pace yourself don' t over do things. If your horses are your way to relax then so be it do it.  Hope things work out. Hugs K",

(Lost the older one mid chemo) Was just about back to 2 miles a day when I had my op. Was back out with her a week later. ( when all the people caring for me had gone back to work and left me in peace!) Mind you we only do about a mile each walk now as chemo left me with peripheral neuropathy in my hands and feet. The cold seems to.make them worse do we might be a bit curtailed this week!  K Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all. Diagnosed 4 weeks ago with triple negative bc and at least one lymph node involves.  Waiting for oncology appointment to start 6 cycles of chemo before either lumpectomy or mastectomy depended on result from another lump being investigated. My problem apart from bc causing swelling under my arm is that I am self employed gardener! I've already lost 2 customers who could be without some one regularly. Everyone else do far has been great. But will I be able to work. From what I can see I may be capable but shouldn't in case I pick up an infection or something. Also being self employed and technically single (have bf but do t live together) it's going to be messy claiming anything. Advise please anyone  gardened whilst having chemo?",

      "Content": "Hi This is the same course of treatment as me. Fec -t chemotherapy now done. Op jan18. The put clips 8n to identify lumps the had looked at (!) And then one into the tumour. The idea is to find it when the chemo has shrunk it. Which in my case it has done. The next stage is to find the clip under mri and insert a wire so the surgeon can find my now slightly bigger than and oxo cube tumour. When you first get diagnosed they tell you so much it does spin your head!  Use this site for more information of your local  Macmillon centre will have lots of helpful advice.  Hugs x",
