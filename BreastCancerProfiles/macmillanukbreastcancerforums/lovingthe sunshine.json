      "Content": "Morning everyone. I am new to this but have found your discussions really helpful!  I had a lumpectomy 29/5/18 with sentinel nodes and 2 glands removed. One out of the three showed cancer cells so I have to have chemo. My oncologist appointment is next Thursday.  The cancer was grade 2 Invasive Lobular.  The consultant said the tumour has gone and surrounding area is clear.  I\u2019ve sort of got my head around having chemo and feel grateful that they\u2019re giving it to me!?!! I think that iF there is anything else there it\u2019ll \u2018mop\u2019 it up!  Before being diagnosed I suffered from night sweats but they went straight after surgery, however the last 3 nights they\u2019ve returned! I feel a bit anxious thinking that something is going on! Has it spread already? Have I got it somewhere else?  I\u2019m on no medication or treatment at the moment.  I am 49 so could be connected to the menopause?  Has anyone else experienced this? Thank you x",

      "Content": "Hi  Thank you.  It\u2019s always good to hear off others and put things into perspective!  I really don\u2019t want to panic at every little thing but sometimes it\u2019s hard isn\u2019t it.  I think I probably read too much too as I read that night sweats can be a symptom of cancer then was diagnosed!  I\u2019ll definitely write things down to ask on Thursday.  Thank you x",

      "Content": "Hi Thank you!  Sometimes you just need to hear the facts.  I just read them think OMG! But hadn\u2019t read that they\u2019re not connected to breast cancer! I know I have to take medication afterwards but will have to have something compatible with varicose veins as I suffer with these. I will enquire about the ER/PR. Thank you.  It really helps to talk to others who are or have been through this!  Thanks x",

      "Content": "Hi.  Good for you! I\u2019ve decided I will do the same once my chemo starts. I know I would find it harder waking up with it on my pillow every morning.  I also agree with \u201cone year out of your life.\u201d  Write it off then carry on!  I\u2019m waiting to see when my chemo starts which I\u2019m finding hard, just want to get it started and get on with it!  Keep strong and positive!  Xx",
