      "Content": "Hi Tilly, thank you   - I was initially going to be doing exactly the same, lumpectomy and radiotherapy. I'll be talking to my nurse this Fri but this chat while waiting is very useful. It's so hard emotionally! especially when you've just spend 2 weeks telling your family how fin you are!  thanks for hugs x",

Do suggest anything you think might be useful to ask  : ) Couldn't discuss reconstruction at last appointment, too much in shock and my lovely team did recognize that and give me this week for adjusting my life spectacles on a changing picture....",

      "Content": "My dear Ruby Rose I'm in Bristol and 55.  Not so young, old enough to know better haha! How sad about your mum. I think the consensus is to crack on with what's recommended. I just wonder if anyone every didn't and whether it was a terrible decision. I've met a woman at Penny Brohn who's decided to cure her cancer naturally through diet etc and she has told me her tumour has shrunk 20% at her last check, however I have a more aggressive cancer found now and I don't like that word aggressive! I will try to talk to her too as I am interested in getting my body to work better for me!  lots of love to you  Lindsay ",

      "Content": "Hi folks  I've had worse news post surgery - what was thought to be a small grade 2 cancer has also shown up some grade 3 in the upper part of the breast. I was beginning to feel almost ok about my scar, the breast doesn't look too bad, and now...surgeon tells me because of the fact the cancer is sited in more than one site, and that the MRI didn't pick up this grade 3, only the histology report, they recommend a mastectomy.  This has been a hell of a shock and knocked me off my perch. I'm looking for a mastectomy buddy who might have been through similar or who can reassure me that mastectomy is the sensible way to go - seems so drastic from where I was only a month ago. Surgery scheduled for 30 August or 14 Sep, I feel like I've entered a parallel universe and things seem to be going too fast for me. : ( So looking for a buddy to ease me through this and help me accept it - I feel like a horse that is about to refuse the fence!",

      "Content": "Hi Jo thanks so much for this kind message, yes they propose immediate reconstruction but I won't be discussing that until I meet surgeon in a fortnight, unless the nurse is going to on Friday, I wasn't at all ready to even think about that a week ago...So yes I need to find out more about that too.  Lumpectomy not failed - just that the MRI didn't pick up that the top patch was, in fact, cancer. Which alarms me a bit. Makes me wonder What Lies Beneath? Snakes and Ladders absolutely!  I wrote my surgeon a limerick where he was the Hero but I've now written another where he's a scalpel happy villain. Black humout can only go so far though and then I'm back to the Kleenex pile..... Lindsay x",

      "Content": "Thanks for sharing something so intimate Jo. I am single so this is hitting hard, I was just plucking up courage to start dating again after a fairly difficult relationship ended, so confidence is a bit low anyway! Anyway we can only hope for the best but I'm just dreading the idea of actually having hormones suppressed to the extent your bones could be affected! loss of hormones during menopause made me go off sex, dryness, low libido, the lot and this is bound to do more of the same!  Doctors were sod all use if I'm honest. That's what made me go for HRT apart from the eternal flushes, looks like maybe that has done me no favours whatsoever. I don't want to carry on being single if I can help it, would love to be married even at 55 never have been! what an uphill journey this seems to be.  It's really good your husband can talk about it - so many people can't Lindsay x x x ",

      "Content": "Thanks Trish, it looks like it has to be  - when I asked What happens if we do nothing and monitor, both nurse & surgeon said almost in one breath, Oh Please Don't, they have given me a window of 2 weeks to think about it, ie they've given me 2 possible surgerydates of 30 August or 14 Sept. I know they've caught it early so the surgeon says that part of the news at least is good, but I'm just wondering where are the stats and stories about the ladies who DON'T take this drastic prescribed route? The trouble is even though my dad died of  prostate cancer I am still woefully ignorant about it and so much info just seems like radio noise - I just cannot seem to digest all this, I know I need to move from my emotional brain to my logic brain to help me make the sensible choice. I'm through all the jagged crying spells I think but devastated is a good word for how it feels.  How are you feeling now? I live alone so am worried about loss of strength/practical ways to cope? Is any help available with say cleaning/gardening through any route do you know? I am leaning so heavily on my very busy friends!!! Thanks Trish, bless you x",
