      "Content": "Hi Ruby Rose, thanks for responding with your experience - I really appreciate it. Yes, I\u2019ve got a wig already in case I need it and will get my hairdresser to trim it so it\u2019s more like my own hair.  I\u2019m glad to read that you\u2019re hair has grown back and that you\u2019re very happy with it. I\u2019ll just be happy if I can keep enough so that it looks \u2018usual\u2019and that I can get away without the wig. I\u2019m also putting on the make-up - even when I go for chemo. It makes me feel better and I\u2019ve also been paying more attention to my skincare. Thank you again Ruby Rose Love, Rambler x",

      "Content": "Hi NiceCuppa, totally agree with you. I washed my hair today and have noticed that I\u2019ve lost some hair at the crown along with at least with major thinning all over. All in just under a week - it\u2019s left me gutted and like you, tipped me over the edge today, but I have a wonderful partner to help me. But its the hair that has sent me low - I can cope with everything else. I just want this shedding to stop! Thanks for taking the time to reply, I really appreciate it and am sending positive thoughts to you ",

      "Content": "Hi, I started my first chemo on the 30th Jan and used the cold cap. Hair-wise all was fine until last weekend when I started shedding hair. I had second chemo with cold cap this week and this morning brushed gently to find that I had to clear my brush five times due to the amount of hair loss. I\u2019ve been constantly shedding since last Saturday and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to stop. I\u2019m finding this very hard to cope with as I\u2019ve always had long straight fine hair (I\u2019m 50). I had it cut into a shoulder length bob ahead of the chemo and am only washing it once a week and don\u2019t style it and am following hair care to the book. I\u2019d appreciate it very much to hear anyone else\u2019s experience of hair shedding: when did it stop (if all), how much hair lost etc. I realise that hair shedding/loss can\u2019t be predicted as it\u2019s so dependent on the individual and their treatment, but any advice, personal experience or morale boosting would be so very welcome at this time. ",
