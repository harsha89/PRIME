I was fine but made sure I didn't try and do too much - I drank plenty of water, wore a hat and used plenty of factor 50 - I really enjoyed my holidays! I also got a letter from my oncologist stating what my diagnosis was, the active treatment I had received and that I was fit to travel. We are fortunate to have travel insurance through my husband's work health policy and they simply asked for a copy of the letter and suggested that I carry a copy with me just in case I did need any medical attention. I'd check with your oncologist but can't see why not. You are not traveling to a country that would raise concerns about medical treatment but do make sure you have travel insurance. Best wishes xx",

I do find that being out in the fresh air and countryside for a walk or similar is really uplifting as well. A trip to the seaside sounds wonderful - must try and do this but living in the midlands means it is a long way to the coast. Today I went into work for a visit and was greeted with lots of hugs and smiles - such a positive experience. everyone was pleased to see me but were insistent that I must only go back when I am ready to. There is another folk club next week and I have arranged to play some tunes on my fiddle provided I am not feeling too sore from the radiotherapy.  I have certainly learnt to enjoy simple things and not take for granted how uplifting they can be. i know that they are going to help me as I continue my treatment and recovery.

I haven't felt up to trying it until now (I finish radio therapy on Tuesday and throughout/since chemo that would have been much too far). I knew it would take us far longer than it used to so wanted to take some drinks and snacks for when I got tired and needed a boost. After a search in the cupboard I found an old 'bum bag' into which i managed to fit my phone, sweets, bottle of water etc so everything did not have to go in my husband's rucksack. The 'bum bag' will certainly be ok for now but not really suitable for when (I hope) we can get back to longer walks and hills. x",

I have gained weight during chemo - I think it is a mixture of not being as active as I usually am (I would be on my feet all day if i was at work and we walk regularly), the effect that losing my sense of taste has on my choices of things to eat (I love fruit and salad but simply can't stand to eat them except in week 3 of the chemo cycle and many of the things I can manage are not the healthiest of foods), not being able to stand the feel of food in my mouth for a few days each cycle, eating 'treats' to cheer myself up and the effects of the steroids. My friend however lost weight during chemo particularly when on T as her mouth was so sore and she had so many ulcers that she barely ate. I was overweight at the start of treatment as attending Slimming World - that is currently on hold.",

      "Content": "We are going on a much awaited holiday to France at the end of next week so I thought I would nip to M&S and buy myself some new underwear. It turned out to be an annoying and upsetting experience. There they were the display stands and row upon row of brightly coloured, assorted styles, pretty lace, funky material, sexy lace under-wired bras (with matching knickers) whilst there were just a couple of stands of non-wired bras in mainly white with a couple of options in black or a kind of beige/flesh colour. My choices were very limited - i just wanted something a bit prettier, and dare I say sexier, than the functional support bras that took up most of the non-wired stand.  I am ok about my slightly mis-shaped boob and my scars, you can't tell that it is smaller and a different shape to the other one when I am clothed. I know I am almost 3 stone overweight but I'm slowly losing the excess and I don't have an issue accepting the oddly shaped flabby bit around my underarm area that is a result of my surgery. Surely it isn't too much to expect to have more choice of bras - maybe something in a funky colour or material, something pretty or sexy that comes with matching knickers? I know that prior to surgery many of the under-wired bras would not have been my fit but I had far more choice. I did manage to buy a couple - one functional and one more lacy (one of only 2 or 3 styles that were available) - but i came home and cried. It just upset me. I know there are other shops I can go to so any recommendations are welcome!  ",

We are going to Pont du Gard early on Tuesday morning (16th) and then on to Uzes for lunch and the afternoon with friends who are staying there. Les Baux is on our list of places to visit and also Arles, Avignon and the roman site just south of St Remy. We may also drive down to the camargue but I'm wary about the reports of insects/mosiquitos I have heard. The plan is to get up and go out early to visit places so that I can avoid being out in the sun during the hottest part of the day.  Best wishes x",

I have days when I just about manage to get to the end of the working day and other days when I am fine. The current problem with my arms is making things more difficult. When I do start to increase my timetable then it will not be my specialist subject which bothers me as it will be more 'stressful'. I really feel for those of you who are in a less fortunate situation. I will be seeing my GP but also need to wait until I have some answers about my current arm problem. The head understands that an increase in my teaching timetable will be gradual so that will also be helpful. I am also considering going down to 4 days. Best wishes.",

Once a style was chosen she ordered it in about 7 different colours - the nearest ones to my existing hair. A week later and it was appointment 2 when I tried them all on and selected the one I wanted. She then trimmed it for me to get the style how I wanted it.   I have worn my wig and a variety of head coverings during treatment. My wig has fooled everyone and people have been amazed when they find out it is a wig. At £67 my NHS subsidised wig has turned out to be less money than I would have spent on hair products and hair appointments in the last 7 months plus I can get ready so much more quickly I have tended to wear it mainly when out in public particularly during chemo when I felt vulnerable. I'm comfortable now wearing head coverings in public but still wear my wig if going out for a meal or to an event.  Hope you can find something you feel comfortable with. Best wishes",

I am trying to keep my mind occupied as well as recovering from the surgery and doing my exercises but find myself worrying about every little twinge in my body. Backache and stomach ache are causing my mind to run riot and I'm sure that the worry is only making them worse. Wish I could stop this as I'm alternating sleepless nights of worry and fear with ones where I do sleep due to sheer exhaustion. I've tried all my usual tricks to aid sleep but still find myself struggling - probably not helped by having a limited sleeping position due to the discomfort after surgery.  Some days I am fine, the strong woman that so many family and friends say I am but at other times I find myself overwhelmed and in tears that seem to happen unprompted. I assume that this happens to others not just me.   I'm struggling this evening and do not want to burden my wonderful supportive husband anymore today as he has an early start in the morning. I just felt I needed to voice all this, to try and put it into words. Thank you for reading x",

I'm looking forward to feeling able to walk further. I have some needlework I could do, colouring books and plenty of books on my kindle to read but often find it hard to settle to things. I have read several books recently but do not always remember what they were about - I think I need to read more slowly as I tend to rush to find out what happens next. As for weird dreams - I haven't any to report. Hi Patsy plum - I wondered how you were getting on x You are right about the crying - i don't try and pull myself together as it is best to let it happen rater than hold it in. I think my husband is now used to this and just offers hugs or a hand to hold for as long as i need if it happens when he is around. As it is half term I will have a few visitors this week which will help with the low points in the afternoons. Xx",

I did smile at the thought of you measuring for curtains at 4am.  I have never used eBay but I might give it a browse, maybe it will help cure the sleeplessness.  It is all the 'what ifs' that bother me. If they need to do more surgery I can't see it being anything other than a mastectomy and I'm kind of ok with that - if they need to remove any more of my breast it would be better to take all of it. It is the worry that it has spread that I am finding the hardest to cope with. After initially being told it was a small early find and likely to be a LWE and rads it then became only one of two nodes were clear and we found 2 other smaller lumps so we need to remove more tissue and nodes. I know this was to get it all out and check how far into the nodes it had gone but it is hard to stem the fears and worries. ",

I also found it good to listen to my iPod at bedtime as this helped me to stop over thinking everything.  Is there a friend who could go with you to your appointment? It helps to have someone with you. I have recently completed chemo after having 2 surgeries to remove a lump and my lymph nodes. It has been tough at times but it is doable and knowing that other people have got through it helps. I'm a worrier and usually try and plan everything well ahead but have learned to take things a step at a time as I had no choice and I've been amazed at how much difference that had made.  Someone reminded me at the start of my treatment that whilst it was new to me it wasn't for the people treating me. They had training and knowledge and for them it was their daily job. I expected people to trust me to do my job so I should put my trust in the team doing their job for me.  This forum is a great support and help -  it is on here where you feel free to ask things no matter how silly you may think they are.  Best wishes x",

Apparently the back of my head is very well covered and looks like I may get a few curls when it gets longer - not that I can see it but several people have commented. I'm being 'brave' and going without headwear except when it is very sunny (don't want a sunburnt scalp). I wasn't sure if I should be flattered or insulted (given the state of my hair) when someone who didn't know about me having cancer commented on my funky summer hair do.  Wish my head hair would grow as well as the unwanted ones on my chin!  I'm off on holiday to the scare the French in a couple of weeks - all notions of trying to look cool and sophisticated are out of the window. I shall just smile. x",

You can do this....Try really really hard not to plan/ think ahead.....(because we are trained to do this professionally it's what we do all the time)....but in this we need to stop ourselves doing it.Things change along the journey and all we are doing is exhausting ourselves when we need every ounce of those energy beans. Nothing prepares us for this  .............I tell myself that I have come this far and I'm going to see tomoro and give it everything I've got!\"  I'm usually a strong person and my husband tells me I am stronger than i think but 2 nights ago I woke up in the small hours sobbing.

I have found that my appetite and sense of taste during chemo has been considerably disrupted making it necessary for me to simply eat what I can actually stand to have in my mouth. Texture as well as taste has been an issue.  I am just recovering from my last chemo and although I have gained weight it is not something I felt able to deal with whilst undergoing treatment. As my sense of taste returns I will go back to eating more sensibly and hopefully I will be able to enjoy the foods I have found completely unpalatable during treatment.  Slimming world is generally a healthy way of eating.",

I had a LWE and sentinel node biopsy but then needed the next layer of nodes removed and a cavity scrape as the first surgery showed that there was more than initially thought and some nodes showed cancer cells. This was followed by scans and I am now halfway through chemo.  I am a worrier and had many sleepless nights thinking about all the what ifs - I think we all do. You will receive lots of support on here so don't be afraid to rant and share.  Whilst I don't have a young child I lost my father in July and have an elderly mother with health issues who lives 3 hours drive away. On hearing of this the BCN referred me for counselling - ask your nurse about this as it should be available and will help you.  I still have times when I feel overwhelmed by it all but have learned to try and focus on each day and stage. Waiting for results and the uncertainty is always hard.  Best wishes x",

I am also fully aware of the importance of the adverts in raising awareness and very much needed funds. It is true that we always think that things will happen to other people not ourselves. My mother-in-law had a mastectomy and rads about 5 years ago in her mid 80s and as a family we have contributed to fundraising much more since then.  Whilst I haven't posted about my situation on Facebook (friends know via private messages and FB had been a great way to keep in touch whilst off work and a source of much love and support from them) due to the way the internet and such things work adverts pop up that link to other searches etc you have done.  Since sharing my diagnosis with friends and colleagues I have been surprised by how many of them have direct experience of similar surgery and treatment.",

I don't know anything about my lump except that it is cancer and was about 15mm - I have not been told anything about the type yet. I suspect that you might have seen the same advert that sent me into a bit of a state (the one where they say how many thousands of women die from breast cancer). I was doing ok with the other adverts I had seen but that one just sent me into a panic and tears. It is so hard to 'keep it together' and not be in a state of constant worry. I keep reminding myself of the 6 people I know personally who have come through all of this and are living full lives a good number of years after their treatment. Sending you hugs x",

It is shorter on top and is taking longer to grow back plus it is either flat or sticking up in random places but is tameable into being encouraged to go in one direction with a bit of mousse. I suspect it may also become curly on top.  It isn't as grey as I thought it would be - hadn't seen my natural colour for years and my mum says it is generally darker than it used to be.  A friend who completed her chemo 9 weeks before me had hers coloured using an organic vegetable based product from Holland and Barrett I think.",

      "Content": "Hi Jen,  Working during chemo treatment depends on how you are on the treatment and what the demands of your job are. I know that there are a number of people on here who have worked and those like me who have not. Some people seem to work in week 3 of each cycle when you generally feel better. I am a secondary school teacher and apart from the fact that I simply would not have had the energy to do my job nor would I have been well enough to cope with it I was advised that it could be dangerous for me to work due to contact with lots of people carrying germs etc.  There is a lot of information on here about side effects and what helps plus you can also join us on the April chemo thread. We are all different and will experience side effects to a different extent. Some people have very few and continue to work apart from a few days each cycle. You will not know how you will be until after your first session. I think there are certain protections whereby your employers cannot put pressure on you with regard to when you work but others will be able to advise more about this. You are not messing people around! You do not yet have sufficient information nor knowledge to answer their questions.  Do check out the information on here about how to prepare for chemo. There are also some threads about working if you search. Best wishes",
