      "Content": "hello,  I know, work should be the last thing I should be worried about. I am 32, I have been diagnosed with breast cancer and I will be undergoing chemo soon. I am worried how to approach work about the possibility of going part time. I work in a dental lab and I think its just too dangerous to be in there when my immune system is at its lowest. I also get the impression they're comparing me to a family member of theirs who still manged to work while having treatment (in a completely different job). I don't want them to make my life harder. can I get someone professional to speak on behalf of me? will I be punished later if I want to go full time?  my work offers no benefits of help, I have been told I will get ssp and I have to use my holidays to cover my hospital appointments.  any advice on how I can approach this. thank you ",

Unlike work who basically isn\u2019t giving me nothing apart from offering ssp. My contract doesn\u2019t say otherwise but this has come as a shock at 32 years old. I have applied to have a dna test to see if I\u2019m carrying the brca gene as my family has quite a lot of early cancer deaths. I went for my first chemo on Monday and got told it hadn\u2019t spread to my lymph nodes. So hopefully i can be mended. ",

I can understand your sons situation as it is easier when your in a place of familiar comfort and support so if there\u2019s one thing I will learn from this is i won\u2019t be scared to ask for help.  I have been to the Maggie centre before my first session. They were very helpful and positive. I will be hopefully getting myself out and about after the first sickness days have passed.  Thank you x",
