      "Content": "Hi there. I have the expandable Becker implants, had right side done in oct and left side done 2 weeks ago. They are hard to start with, as will your chest muscles be after each fill, but they do settle down and soften after a while - might right side is now soft and I can move it around a bit. I massage bio oil on them every day, massage is supposed to help prevent capsular contracture and the bio oil is good for scars too xxx",

I do have some swelling under the arm which should go away naturally but my surgeon says she can drain it if need be. You can get really good soft bras from tk maxx, they're the Marilyn Munro range and come in a 2 pack. Xx",

      "Content": "Treatment isn't nice, no point in lying about it... But it is doable. Like I say I was devastated when I was told I needed it, cried non stop for 2 days, but it's not as bad as you think it's going to be. I had FEC-T, had worse side effects on the tax part but everyone is different. A lot of it is mental, must be because hormones are all out of sync. It seems at the start like it's a long way off but it does go in pretty quickly. At the time I desperately wanted my nodes to be clear and no chemo required but with hindsight I'm glad I had it to give me the best possible chance of no recurrences. It's a horrible disease and as cliche as it is, a positive mental attitude is half the battle :) xxx",

      "Content": "There are so many different treatments, my onc says finding two people at the same hospital with the same diagnosis is like winning the lottery. It all depends on age, size, type of cancer, grade and composition and also how many lymph nodes are affected. They don't really know everything for sure until the full lump is analysed. I was strongly ER and PR positive, HER2 -ve and grade 3, invasive ductal cancer. I have mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy in oct and one lymph node came back with a small amount of cancer in it. I was hoping to avoid chemo but my surgeon wouldn't take the chance.. I was devastated, BUT I got through it, finished 4 weeks ago. It did go in much quicker than I expected. Just try to take one thing at a time, focus on your op and then worry about the rest. Good luck with everything xxx",

      "Content": "I'm also BRCA2... Had LB MX and immediate recon in oct and going in for same on RB later this week. I'm 28 and had hoped to start a family within the next couple of years, but that plan has been scuppered! I froze embryos pre-chemo, and plan to be on tamoxifen for 10 years, with a break after 5 to try for a baby. Then I want my ovaries out. Originally when I was told I was BRCA2 +ve the geneticist said it was unlikely to 'hit' before 40 and I found my lump that evening, so don't want to wait too long before having them out!",
