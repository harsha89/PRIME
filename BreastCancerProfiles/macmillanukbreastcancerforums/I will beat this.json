      "Content": "Hi guys I don't know if any if you remember me posting last week about the amount of pain I was in after my 1st round of docetaxel. It started with pain in my legs then travelled to my upper body. On Sunday I went to hospital & was admitted. With that chemo your sent home with an injection for 5 days that apparently builds up your white blood cells. I had a bad reaction to the injections making my white cell count drop to 0.4 which is way below what it should be. Because it dropped so low I caught an infection in hospital. The doctors have said they want me to continue with the injection next time and to be prepared because this can happen to me again. The only way I can describe the pain is childbirth with no baby at the end. I'm due to have the chemo again on 13th feb & I'm absolutely petrified",

I always say positive mental attitude. Stay strong and use all the family & friends support you can. On days you have appointments see if a friend that gives you a good laugh & cheers you up can attend with you. Maybe go out for lunch with them after. Make it something to look forward to. Xxx",

So do we need to be in tears infront of them before they realise WERE NOT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE and we can't do the things we would like to. Do we enjoy having a bald head and 1 tit.

Docs have said to me their treating me for a bloodclot as a precaution until I have a scan today to rule it out. If it's not a blood clot its Lymnphedema . How stupid of me. I've just realised not only am I swollen down one side I've not been able to wear my regular bras because I'm very swollen under the arm. So Im sure the blood clot will get ruled out. So now where do I go from here. What will the treatment be. And what will the complications be. One thing I have noticed over the past month is I could have a tiny spot and if for some reason the tiny scab comes off I loose quiet a bit of blood from it. ",

I just want you to know I had my examination, mamogram, scan & biopsy on the same day & was told to come back about 6hrs later for my results. I did have an advantage over most because my cousin was a childminder for the BCN and she really looked after me, but it goes to show you it can be done. I hope it's not the dreaded. There's no point in telling you not to worry because we've all been there & know what it's like. I will be thinking of you on tues & praying that your be ok. Good luck Hun & keep us updated. I hope it's goods news. Xxx",
