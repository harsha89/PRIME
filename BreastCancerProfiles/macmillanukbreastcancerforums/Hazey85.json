      "Content": "Thanks for your speedy reply George and Jackie and yes you might be right think I need time to adjust. It's probably a shock to the system. If doesn't clear up like you say I'll see GP. I think any new twinge or pain and I panic. Oh blimey you have a good memory I went to see consultant who examined me and was happy it was just normal lumpy breast tissue so I will keep my eye on it and I'm due my 1st post dx mammogram in June so not long to wait. Thank you for asking very thoughtful of you xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, started taking tamoxifen last Monday and have this constant dull headache that doesn't really get any better. Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this and if it will go over time and it's due to the sudden hormone changes?? Not sure if trying a different brand will make any difference?? Thanks for taking time to read xx",

Yes this is what I'm experiencing like a pressure in my temples and a bit fuzzy from the minute I wake til I sleep, trying to function normally but finding it a bit difficult then getting stressed which doesn't help the headache. I'm glad yours settled and I'm hoping mine does too xx",
