I've heard people, not necessarily on here, say they even avoided going to the cinema etc, in case they picked up a bug. Madness. To be honest, I carried on as normal and did and ate what I liked. I may just have been very lucky but I came out the other side relatively unscathed. I'm not saying ignore the advice, but you could spend hours peeling all your fruit and veg diligently and then pick up a bug while on the bus going for your treatment. I suppose what I'm saying is there is an element of chance in all of this. Being sensible is sensible but you can't avoid every risk.",

Since my diagnosis I have been prone to bouts of paranoia, thinking they may be sugar coating or flim flaming. I think there is a stereotype image of these professionals scrutinising scans and discussing our bits and deciding on what's best for us, and then, when all the info is in, imparting edited version of their wisdom to us poor mortal thickies. I think this may be how it was in the past. I feel so much more confident that I am being told the truth as they see it and that nothing is being hiden from me.",

A malignant tumor is a cancerous tumor and vice versa. So, if you have been told your tumor is cancerous it means it is malignant. Sorry if this is labouring the point, but I think it's important you understand what you've been told. Like the others have said it is really important you find out who your BCN. It is a shame she wasn't there when you were given the news, or at least you given her details. This is usually what happens.",

It says in moderate to severe depression psychological therapy should be offered as a first line treatment and that antidepressant meds only used if in conjunction with talking therapy. It also says that therapists must be trained professionals in child and adolescent mental health. Has your SD been referred to CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services). If the GP has identified moderate to severe depression, which from the treatment plan appears to be so, then it seems to my mind this is indicated. I agree, it is a worry. She obviously said enough to the GP for him/her to be quite concerned. If she really is depressed than hopefully this is being addressed appropriately. However, in my own work I have seen many people who have gone on to develop a dependence, not so much the medication, as it's not addictive, but on the whole caring that is elicited in these situations.",
