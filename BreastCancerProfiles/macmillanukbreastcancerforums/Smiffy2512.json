      "Content": " Hi all having been diagnosed stage 2 BC just over a week ago - 16mm lump in left breast and at least 1 node showing cancer 1 small lump no cancer am considering best next step for treatment. Have been advised lumpectomy/WLI with radiotherapy and removal of all lymph nodes. If 4 or more lymph nodes show signs of cancer followed by chemo with possible CT scan to see if spread. I would prefer CT scan first to establish if already spread as no results yet of proliferation rate so how do they know it's not growing really quickly and spreading whilst I wait up to 31 days for surgery? The nurse I questioned re private treatment without private healthcare was very dismissive and said treatment the same but have had two friends with cancer who have been private immediate CT scan,  one showed cancer had spread so change to first thought treatment and one showed no signs of spreading. I have an appointment tomorrow at private hospital to discuss CT scan and treatment to pay for lumpectomy with follow up treatment radiotherapy and if needed chemo on NHS. Anyone else been down this route and have advice. Thanks in advance ",

      "Content": "Thanks Julia I went to private hospital today for a discussion and decided on having a CT scan on Wednesday this week privately as I think this will put my mind at rest and then I am going to wait for my appointment with the NHS. Soooooo many people say this is the way forward so,I have listened to those that have been through this and it feels good to have made a decision. I will have my pre op with NHS Wednesday with my CT scan in the afternoon and take it from here.   Thanks for your advice.",

      "Content": "Hi Grannie I was diagnosed almost 4 weeks ago. Had a marker put in one small lump, which following biopsy was found to be non cancerous and I then paid privately for a CT scan which showed a number of shadows in my lungs. I was due to go in last Tuesday for a WLI but once they found the shadows they have now changed my treatment plan.... They are unsure what the lumps are but now what to do chemo first with a combination of Taxotere, trastuzumab and Pertu2umab to see if the lumps in the lung shrink. If they do, bad news they are cancer and if they don't good news.  I am devastated I had my treatment plant for BC in my head and new where I was going but now feel totally at sea. I don't even have a date now for any of this to move forward as it not urgent - according to the oncologist. No, not to him it's not .... I fell like I am back to square 1 with no diagnosis, no treatment start date and will be waiting until half way through 6 sessions of chemo, one every 3 weeks before I know whether I have lung cancer. I had even said good bye last week to work colleagues on Friday, taken Mondayboff to prepare myself for Tuesday and then had to go back to work as I don't get paid sick- felt really stupid when everyone asked me whatbinwas doing back in. I just want a date for this horrible inconvenience to start so that I can start to move forward. It really is shit....",

      "Content": "hi all just a quick note. yeah yesterday went well and my bloods were back up, my chest port worked for,the first time and chemo round 2 down. Felt good to,have no issues this time. I hope the rest goes as smoothly. Still,there from 10am to 5.30 which makes for a long day but don't mind if all goes well. Complaining to the ward manager and my oncologist about the way treated by nurses previously might have worked. today I have the most awful stomach cramps and nothing is staying in. Have taken Imodium but I know deptarment say if continues you need to ring them. Any idea what they domif you ring them. imhave kidney scan booked for,this afternoon to see what showed up,on my recent CT scan. Dr thinks, it is a cyst. I am worried about what it might be but don't want to cancel appt due to waiting time but not sure I can manage to go at the moment Anyone else had to get support re diarrheoe ?",

      "Content": "HinJulia thanks for your response. I told my friend today and whilst devastated initially she very quickly said we will get through this together. She we have to still go on our booked holiday next week where we will have a fab time seeing the world together, eating, drinking and maybe even crying if we have to and we will come back and get on with this inconvenience and come out stronger. So glad she was so positive. You really never know what people are going to say and she does not live near so had to tell her over the phone which made it more difficult. Thanks for your email.",

      "Content": "Hi all new to this sight and the thoughts surrounding breast cancer. Found a lump last week went to Dr as mum had breast cancer and passed away from secondary bone cancer and I have been on HRT patch for 11 years following hysterectomy due to endometriosis. Mammogram, ultrasound and discussion with consultant led to them telling me it doesn't look good and that almost definitely breast cancer. I had 3 biopsies taken from area and from node as inflamed and that was Tuesday. Still really sore and not sure if this is 'normal'. They might have told me but I don't remember. Am going back next week to get results and talk treatment- to tell family to give them a heads up, or to not tell family that is the question? Am supposed to be going on holiday a week Sunday with best friend for a few days shopping and sunning in Abu Dhabi -go, don't go, tell her when I find out results before we go, don't tell her as feels selfish and might ruin holiday...... Such confusion. How do you tell people ? Any thoughts from anyone would be much appreciated. Have to return to work tomorrow and really don't feel like it.... Again what to say, to who and when.... Xxxx",

      "Content": "HinFiona thank you for response. I have had a few responses to my email, all which have been really useful. I decided to tell my sons a couple of days ago what was going on and they, and their partners have Ben really supportive. I have explained that I am waiting for my results but that all,things are pointing toward it being Bc. They were fantastic. Immediately said we will all get through this. Won't be easy but whatever happens we will fight it together which I never doubted but it was good to hear. I now wait till Thursday when I get my results proper but I am trying to remain in a positive mood knowing that together we as a family can get through anything. Thanks Chris",

Have practicing what to say out loud - a bit like I do before doing presentations at work - and has made me feel more powerful about telling them. I think now so that I can prepare them. That's how I would want to be told so gut feeling is going to give them all I know tonight and follow next week when I know more. Xxxx",

Can I get results and then go private for any surgery and then back to nus for further treatment if necessary. I keep,thinking I am a bit ahead of myself having not received full diagnosis yet but they seemed pretty sure following mammogram, ultrasound and discussion. Hope you can help thanks",
