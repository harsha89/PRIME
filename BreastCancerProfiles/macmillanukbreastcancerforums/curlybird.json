      "Content": "Hi Wynneth I had a mastectomy with node clearance at the same time in July. I returned to be drained 7 times. The whole area was like a hot water bottle (not hot) you know how water in a hot water bottle swishes around when you pat it. I was going twice a week to be drained at first then as it settled once a week. It did stop though. Luckily no infection. For anyone reading this about to have the op, being drained didn\u2019t hurt as the area the syringe went in was still numb, for me anyway.  Hope it slows down soon for you. Take care Helen x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone  I started my first of FEC yesterday, surprised it was given in syringes. I also tried the cold cap. First time it was put on the front of my head was burning and nothing for the rest. They switched caps and it was then cold all over, no burning. I have thick (now short) hair so maybe more insulation. I found the experience ok apart from looking like a plum! Overall the day went well. my friend bought me a heated fleece shawl from Lidils £16.99. Towards the end I felt a bit chilly and the shawl was great to snuggle into. I felt rough last night and a bit nauseous but feeling better this morning, fingers crossed. Good luck everyone xx",
