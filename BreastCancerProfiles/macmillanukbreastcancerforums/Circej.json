    "Content": "Hi, Great news about how much your tumour has shrunk I also had chemo first and saw the surgical team to discuss surgery 3 weeks after my last chemo session, the week before my hospital sent me for a CT scan, MRI, mammogram and an ultrasound (if you don't know if these have booked your breast cancer nurse should be able to chase for you). I had surgery 2 and a half weeks after that ( 5 and a half weeks after my last chemo), from everything I read beforehand 4-8 weeks is the normal wait and they won't operate before 4 weeks have passed after chemo, as your immune system has to recover. Hope that helps!",
