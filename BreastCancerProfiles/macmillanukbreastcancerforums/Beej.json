    "Content": "I agree completely, although I've not seen the Corrie story. I think that it was sensitively handled at the start with the diagnosis, but I struggled with Jen post op wearing low cut tops in many scenes, seemingly functioning as normal in between chemo, no sign of side effects and her hair appeared to be her own with the wig used only as a prop for comic scenes. It makes it all look like following the op life pretty much continues uninterrupted for Jen and I just feel that if a programme is going to tackle such a tough subject, they should think about they present it. Deciding to have chemo is not a light decision and if someone watches that and thinks it will be a breeze, they're in for a shock.",
