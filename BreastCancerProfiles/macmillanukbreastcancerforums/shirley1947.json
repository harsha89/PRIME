    "Content": "Hi sunshine, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in March of last year, I had a mastectomy in May, they also removed 16 lymph nodes. One lump was 13cm the other 8cm, 2 lymph nodes were infected and it was a worrying time before I was told that it hadn't travelled to anywhere else in my body. I had 4 chemo sessions to begin with, I did have a lot of nausea and everything tasted metallic, I then went on to have 12 biological chemo, which wasn't as unpleasant as the first 4 but my hair fell out again. After finishing with the chemo I had 25 radiotherapy sessions which were every day but I am clear of cancer and although I have to have injections every three weeks for a year my hair is growing again and I feel so much better. Don't be scared put your trust in the doctors, they do know what they are doing and you will get through this. You will feel very tired so let others help you with the children, the housework and cooking meals etc. it's a long journey but there is a light at the end of the tunnel, you are young and your body can fight this, if I can do it at 67 you can. God bless you and your family, if you don't mind I will add you to my prayers for your healing.",
