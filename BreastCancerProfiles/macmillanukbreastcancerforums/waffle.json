    "Content": "After 1st Tax i wake up with no feeling in my ring and little fingers and have to shake them loads to get circulation back into them, the locum oncologist who to be honest was poo as she was more interested in talking to a sales rep on her phone than listening to me, didn't even seem to be remotely bothered, i still have numb patch in end or little finger. Had such a bad experience with side effects that i am really worried as i need to be able to use my fingers, toes were effected also but seem better now, and really cold feet?",
