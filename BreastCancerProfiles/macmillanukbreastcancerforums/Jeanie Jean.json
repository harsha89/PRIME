      "Content": "Hi Vicky I had the same chemo regime as you. 4 of EPI and 4 of CMF CMF stands for Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil 5FU (CMF) The CMF is much kinder to the body than the EPI. Any questions then fire away. Best wishes, Jean xx",

      "Content": "Hi Vicky Don't even think about the radiotherapy just now. Believe me it is a walk in the park compared to chemo. The only real annoying thing about RT is the fact that you have to attend hospital every day for the treatment and the treatment only lasts a few minutes. Please feel free to ask me anything about EPI and CMF. As far as I am aware, for the past year there have only been 2 of us on this regime and the other lady no longer contributes to the forum. Hope all goes well with you during your treatment. Best wishes, Jean xx",

      "Content": "Hi Vicky It will be the usual regime for the type of BC that we have. If you click on my picture you can read my story from start to finish. Remeber everyone reacts differently to the cancer drugs, so you will not necessarily follow the same side effects as me. As far as I am concerned the worst side effect was losing my taste buds. All food tasted like old socks when this happened. They always come back, though, so it was great to look forward to tasting things again. During the loss of taste, I could only taste things like fresh pineapple, tomato juice with lashings of Lea and Perrins sauce and curries! Best wishes, Jean  ",
