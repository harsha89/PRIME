      "Content": "Hope everyone had a lovely Christmas. I did my last chemo on Dec 10th, in my mind I was so excited and  thinking yippeeeeee I can have a good Christmas cas i'll be back to normal (almost). Thing is, EC wasn't too bad, I'd be back to normal after a week or so and with Docetaxel  first cycle was very painful but was prepared for the other 3 so with painkillers they got much more bearable. With that I thought I would be ok now and ready for surgery but I have these weird sensations/ pins and needles in my hands and feet.. my legs are so, so heavy, walking takes so much effort and I think I have fluid retention, elevating my feet and drinking loads of water doesn't seem to be helping. My hands hurt when I stretch them out and not to mention the fatigue.. walking from one room to another is so tiring, I have to sit for a minute or two..  yet I can't sleep much so I lie in bed and stare at the tele.. Have lots of sch work I could be doing but can't concentrate on anything, not even to read which I like doing.. omg I know I'm feeling worst than I did throughout chemo ..  (mind you, I'm glad it's over) Did anyone feel like that after chemo? What I find strange is when I go out (which isn't that often) I feel like I'm about to faint, don't know if its the wig that makes me sweat like mad lol :-) but my eyes get wobbly/ feel like they're spinning and I start to feel like I'm intoxicated.. honestly If people only knew the ordeal  we're going through..  they look at me and say you look well, thank God you've finished chemo but if they only knew how achy and frustrated I'm feeling............... Don't want to run to my GP for every single thing... thanks for listening to my ramblings , I just want to throw it our there, cas I'm wondering if its just normal.. Njoy your evening and hang In their guys hugs Lizane",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie, I did my mx and immediate diep flap reconstruction exactly one year ago. I was looking forward to the nipple reconstruction to \"finish off\" because though I am so grateful to have 2 breasts, I think I would prefer the nipple reconstruction as well. I was put on the waiting list to get this done soon but now something else has come up I am In limbo at the mo and don't know what is next. I just hope and pray all will be well. Whatever you decide, I am sure it will make you happy. Sadly, I have not undressed fully  infront of my boyfriend  since I did my surgery, I always have my top on and I read posts like what George says about his beloved Jackie and keep thinking am I selling myself short with this person I am with, I think I would be comfortable being naked knowing he wouldn't freak out but I am very uncertain... Inspite of my reservations, I am so grateful to have life and if it means being nippleless then hey.. I still have all my limbs and I know I am beautiful. Have a blessed day",

      "Content": "Hi Skippy. Hope your sister is feeling better today. I'm not medically trained but I think all those injections to boost white blood count will cause some pain because they cause bone marrow to get swollen... I was on one called Filgrastim, it had to be taken for 8 days after day 2 of Taxotere chemo and first cycle I ended up in Emergency, I would describe the pains I felt as mind blowing...I honestly thought I was dying.. But after the first cycle  it wasn't so bad as I was prepared for it.. I think the key tip is to start taking painkillers a day or 2 before so they're in your system. All the best Lizane",

It seems that sometimes we don't realise how lucky we are  or that things can indeed get worst so we have to be grateful for mercies. I said what I said about not being topless since my surgery because of things that he says that makes me uncomfortable to want to show.... been with him for a long time, we have a lot of history and though I keep saying this journey has taught me to not sweat the little things and to not put up with bull.. sometimes I think I'm accepting less than I deserve. He's sometimes the sweetest person and he' been supportive at home during some of the worst times during treatment, picking me up at appointments or from chemo... but he never once came to any of my appointments or to chemo with me, most of which I went to alone... and my two occasions at the hospital for my mx surgery and another surgery he did not once visit me.. he was always at the end of the phone but didn't come to visit because he doesn't like hospitals or lot of men go off their partners when they see them looking a certain way in the hospital bed so........ I don't even argue about things anymore but sometimes I sit and think wow... I look after this man and though he says the right things.. the actions sometimes says another... guess I'm just a walkover!! Anyway, it is what it is.... I hope you are well and happy, Warm hugs",

My nipple reconstruction has not been postponed, I have been on the waiting list for that surgery since October but now my care team is doing some investigations into some hip pains I am experiencing, they haven't confirmed what it is.. bone metastasis? avascular necrosis? other? so waiting to see a bone doctor..  I don't know if this will interfere with the nipple recon.. the pain I feel first thing In the mornings when I try to stand or walk is so bad I think this will take priority. I am hoping for the best...... You asked how long it took for my stomach to settle down.. my surgery was January 29th 2014, they had to do surgery in May to clean the area, because tummy and breast would fill up almost to discomfort and was too much and too thick to drain.. they kept me in hospital with drains for 9 days and 2 wks after it filled up again... I was going back to see the surgeon up to July 2014 regarding the areas filling up.. I eventually decided to just leave it and see what happened.. I think it slowly reabsorbed and I noticed this around October/ November time. Saying that, I do still sometimes feel like the tummy area is a bit stiff.. I saw the surgeon 2 wks ago and he is still quite puzzled why it kept happening.. strange thing my dear. Have yours settled down any since? Sometimes we just need to give it time, I do know it is a worry. All the best and warm hugs.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone.... I am scheduled to start Chemo on Monday, 4 of EC and 4 Taxotere (hope I've gotten the types right, everyone on here seems so versed in these terms).. Anyway, I'm a Secondary school teacher and being told everyone responds differently  to chemo drugs, I haven't yet signed off work to accommodate that and with only 2 weeks left before the school year ends I thought i'd  try to ride it out and see how I feel each day.. Trouble is i'm wondering with the low immune system travelling on public transport to and from work and working with children who more often than not have very poor hygiene... and (not being disrespectful to Anyone's religion) but  Ramadan will be starting soon and working in a school with a high percentage of Muslim kids, they tend to spit everywhere... For those of you who's been through Chemo, do you think its better if I just took the time off? My employer is very supportive so time off isn't a problem but I was trying to save as much of my paid leave as a mastectomy has been predicted and with that, hopefully all goes well I am hoping to go down the route of immediate recon... What do I do? What would you do? Tell me what you think please... Also, I had 3 lymph nodes removed less than 2 weeks ago and lifting my arm like b4 is not without strains.. I'm wondering is the chemo will interfere with full healing ... As you all say in one way or another, being diagnosed with bc is a life changing experience, right now i'm scared of the journey, anxious to start treatment and  beat this bugger but in the mean time I wish I could tell my mom who would no doubt comfort me and tell me what to do. Keep fighting the good fight xxx Warm hugs",

Thank you so much to George and Jackie, Anna, Sue, Cathy and C for your responses. I must say they were spot on and really helped me. Up to 2 days after chemo I was thinking \"wow, no nausea, I feel fine!\" and Bam, on day 4 the aches started.. lasted a whole week with high temperature, a call to the ambulance service and a visit to the hospital on day 6 when I honestly thought I was going to die from the unbearable, crippling  pains I was getting up and down my spine/back. Not to scare anyone but it was frightening.. I was told that on top of the Taxotere it was the Filgrastim injections I was taking to help boost my white blood count .. What  was scary, after a week of pains, fever I was told that the hospital the ambulance took me to didn't treat me as they should have.. instead of just giving me painkillers and sending me home, they should have taken cultures, admitting me and giving antibiotics etc... but thank God worst didn't happen.. Hopefully, now that i've seen what it is like I will be better prepared for the next 3 cycles.   Please everyone, continue replying to people's posts because you have no idea how helpful and uplifting a thought... a piece or advice.. a kind word is.   One Love Lizane",

While I was going through chemo, it seemed like I had forever to think about it but for the past month i've done nothing but eat, sleep and live \"what should I do? What should I do? and it's the hardest decision i've ever had to make. I've met with both the plastic surgeon and my breast surgeon and gone over the pros and cons of each option, I've read up and watched videos, looked at pics and it doesn't make it any easier.. I will have to do a left mx and my initial decision was to use tummy tissue (diep) for  immediate reconstruction ...but I think the fear of having 2 surgical sites got to me and all I kept thinking about was it must be very painful to recover from all that, I don't want to have so many scars and  the risks!! .. just constant negative thoughts .. So I requested an appointment to speak to my Breast surgeon again and after much consideration, sleepless nights and prayers I've decided to go with my gut feelings and guidance from the professionals and do the diep... After all, using implants while a shorter op and recovery time, has risks just as the bigger op but as the good Doctor said, its a long term investment.... my mx and immediate reconstruction will be in 4 days and yes I'm scared but I'm trusting God and the good doctors that i'll be fine.... After breaking down crying when I left the doctor's office today, I came home, took a nap and I'm feeling rather calm now...

I know you will find the same inner strength, not to mention strength to fight when you think of your 3 kids. I'm 36, was diagnosed May 2013, I was devastated and cried for about 2 weeks, only stopping when I managed to fall asleep.. but since that time I've managed to do 8 cycles of chemotherapy over a six month period, 6 of which cycles I was there by myself, attended many appointments by myself yet again, lost my hair, eyelashes, brows etc, walked around with a picc line for those 6 months of chemo, something I was dreading .. had a mastectomy and reconstruction plus so many other bumps along the journey yet I coped and I'm doin well and believe me, at the start of the journey I didn't think of myself as a strong person, but as I said my dear  you never know how strong you are until strong is the only choice you have.. I won't say you won't get those very sad days, or those sudden outburst of tears but you will cope because if you're like all of us on here, you are willing to do whatever it takes to fight for your life. ..I'm 2 wks post surgery and thinking there is light at the end of the tunnel but we are all here to hold each other's hands.. before you know, six months would have passed and though sometimes things will seem like it's taking forever, you will realise it does go quickly. Hang in there and you will realise there is nothing you cannot ask that someone on here will not respond to. Take care and all the best with your treatment Lizane xx Enter your message...",

I was called because there was a cancellation but had chemo that day and wasn't able to attend so they do call you up at short notices when there's a cancellation. It was really nice though I felt completely at ease to take off my wig in public and try out the make up tips. I got a nice little goodie bag with all sorts of make up.

I thought it would be hard but as everyone say on here, you develop strength you didn't know you had or you do what you have to do and it's all in the name of building our immune system to prevent infections so ... I used to do it in my thigh (the fatty parts) lol.. and a slightly different spot each day and the remove it from the refrigerator 30 minutes before you use it. I don't know if you were told otherwise but I wasn't told upfront to remove them from the refrigerator 30 mins before ... the first time I took it from fridge and used it straight away,  2 days after I was in so much pain , I had to call an ambulance and was admitted in hospital for a day with an infection.. It was then that one of my chemo nurse asked me if I had allowed the injections to rest 30 minutes before using so... Those are my tips, once you start you'll be fine.. Use the alcohol pads to rub the area, you won't even feel it. Let us know how u get on :-) Lizane",

They're not telling me what's wrong; just that the MRI shows fluid and abnormalities in the hip joint and until I see a bone doctor and get a bone biopsy done they can't confirm or rule out anything. So more of the waiting game!!! The onc said they can't explain what it is... It is just too much; the waiting, the not knowing, the worry,  the anxiety!! Going through breast cancer and all it's treatments once in a lifetime is just too much for any person to have to deal with.. and just  a year after all that I am here again, going out of my freaking mind!!  I am just praying it turns out to be arthritis.. To make things worst, cyct on the ovaries need to be investigated since I'm on Tamoxifen. Oh Universe can't we get a break here!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone had a similar experience that turned out to be not related to previous diagnosis? I don't want to even say it.. I keep thinking, ok 4 Lymph nodes were negative when tested so surely its not???

Initially, at work I would go into explaining the treatment plan to those who were made aware of my illness.. now I sit back and think, hold on, that's just someone you work with, its not a friend so you should have just said i'm fine.. Nowadays I use i'm ok and stop there, unless its a close friend or family. It's sad to say but sometimes I think though some people are really genuine and want to know how you are, some are just nosy and want to know so they can pass it on in their little discussions/ gossip.. In my opinion, its not trivial, what I would say is it's up to each of us to answer how we want, but I think I will continue to say i'm fine to some, I think we can all sense the genuine how are you and answer accordingly.. . Sorry to hear about your recurrence, but continue to be strong and trust in your breast care team and the vast improvement in technology and treatments. Warm hugs to you and take care until ...

I have stage 3 invasive breast cancer and after an mri they spotted a 2nd or possibly 3rd lump in the same breast.. now awaiting results for that, I am really hoping they are benign as the doctors think cas Lord I cant take more bad news..  I am 35 and initially thought i'm only 35, too young or this but coming on here I realise that there are so many people younger than I am, and i'm not alone.. All I keep thinking is I don't want to die... Its scary ... Thanks for sharing, it is somewhat comforting.. Student midwife, you are not alone. God bless and good luck ..",

I'm recovering well I think, based on my breast surgeon's repeated \"remarkable! remarkable\" :-))..  I'm not sure what the strange feeling with hands/ fingers are about, whether nerve damage or side effects from the Taxotere.. somehow I don't think it's the latter as it's only been this way for the past week or so... today it feels like I have scorched my left hand with steam or hot water.. finger tips feel (but does not really look) blistered and yes the slight numbness/tingling sensation. The right hand is not nearly as bad as the surgery side.. no clue what's going on. Have an appointment to see onc tomorrow so will speak to my breast care nurse. As for the seroma, I don't know why I laugh but I do, the one in my tummy has a rippling effect when I touch it, I'm not panicking yet though as the surgeon explained to me what would happen if it got too uncomfortable so.. Thanks for the good wish.. P.s. Would you question your oncologist  much if you were told you didn't need radiotherapy? I did 8 cycles of ECT chemo, did mx .. 0/4 lymph nodes negative.. tumours in the same area of left breast removed with clear margins, and had shrunk from 20mm to 9 mm and down to grade 2 after surgery. I don't want to get too excited yet about not having to do radiotherapy but what if it will help prevent recurrence?? I was told I will be on tamoxifen but should I push for radiotherapy?

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am so happy at the moment for the lifeline but so, so cross that these Doctors are playing with my life and have me on the scariest roller coaster ride ever. Since early December it's been uncertainties, ups and down and now I've been told this (happy to hear this but do these doctors realise what they're doing to my mental state?!! To not have to go through the situation from scratch, After ct scan,x ray, mri, I was told by oncologist that it might be bone mets in hip, but not sure cas it didn't show up on scan like typical mets... they weren't sure so they would refer me to the orthopaedist who is the bone expert.. saw him on February 3th, he said it didn't look like bone mets... looked a biit like AV but to be sure, he would get the Expert Radiologist to look at scans... went back to see Oncologist on Feb 18th, she sprung it on me that the Orthopedist had called her to confirm that it was indeed bone mets, I broke down, not being able to ask any question to clarify anything. I left her office in tears, on the train all the way home etc etc.. u can imagine the devastation I was feeling.. forward a week after that, on February 25th I went back to see another oncologist, the one incharge of radiotherapy this time.. now I have all my questions written down... I ask how do they know its bone mets if they haven't done a biopsy of the hip bone?... her answer was the Doctor's experience and the mri scans?.. I ask can the affected area be operated on, she says no , operating on hip would be a major surgery and no guarantee they would get it all, as its already spread from breast.. I ask is it outter bone or inside bone, she said bone marrow involvement.. I ask do patients survive for very long with bone mets, this woman tells me blatantly, not longer than 10 years, no empathy nothing.. I a 37 years old, straight away I'm thinking omg I'm going to die.. do I start planning my funeral? Do I stop working? Do I start telling those family members who don't know? All these questions... she said its now terminal and they can try and treat it but meds only work for a time and then stop so I should just live my life and try and enjoy the time I have left ... I leave there being told I will be starting 2 weeks of radiotherapy and denosumab injections for the rest of my life. And I should stop taking Tamoxifen because they're changing it to letrozole and zoladex .. I ask her, should I still go to my Friday appointment with the orthopedist since I've already been told that my diagnosis was confirmed by him, she says says yes....I leave there thinking I'm goin  to die sooner than I think, omg how, why? .. Sorry, just trying to express how I was feeling....  I go to my appointment on Friday, Feb 27th.. the orthopaedist ask how I am, I said devastated, it's not everyday I'm told I have a terminal illness. he asks what was the last thing I was told.. I tell him they said it was confirmed that its not AV but its bone mets and will start treatment on March 6 th.. he starts to apologise and explain that the Expert radiologist was on holidays and it was the registrar who confirmed that it was bone mets, but that was not the case because now the expert radiologist has examined the scans and said it is 100% Avascular necrosis and not bone mets so he will put me on waiting list to do surgery (core compression ) to try and correct the issue...I ask are you sure? he says yes and its been sent off to wherever.. I ask how soon to you get the results from your testing place he says he doesn't know but see the emails that topman says it is not bone ..s  guys can imagine the relief when he said AV  is the lesser of two evils, ... that was after 5 on Friday so couldn't get to speak to oncology team or breast or  care nurse... I am just so upset that they don't check and make sure they are 100% before they pass on a diagnosis to patients!! I have to wait until tomorrow to try and get through to the breastcare nurse and the oncologist's secretary but I am going to insist on a bone biopsy.. and express my upset about the turmoil and stress they are causing me.. How would you guys handle this? Thanks, Lizane",
