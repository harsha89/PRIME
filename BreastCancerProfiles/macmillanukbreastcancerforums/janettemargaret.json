      "Content": "Thank you Gillie, this really helps. I like your idea about a treat before/after radiotherapy.   I think my wobble started with the planning session.  I was really surprised at how emotional and vulnerable I felt, lying on the bed with the CT scanner - I didn't feel as much of a wuss before/after surgery. I felt really self-conscious as well with three people hovering over me, more so again than with surgery.   I'm sure I'll be fine once it all gets underway.  Thank you for your support and kind words.

      "Content": "Hello all,  I'm a newbie to the site, had my surgery back in February and am due to start radiotherapy next week. I declined chemo as the predictor test the oncologist showed me didn't seem to offer me a significant benefit weighed against the side effects of the chemo and I've been feeling really well, after having three lots of antibiotics to clear up infection from the site of my axillary  lymph node clearance. I've been positive and trying to keep my spirits up.  I have a husband (who is lovely, but like a guard dog at the moment), 17 year old daughter and two sons (late twenties) both on the Autistic Spectrum.  I also have some brilliant friends.  However, yesterday and today, I just felt like utter crap.  I just wanted to lay in bed and shut the world out.  It was a real effort to get up and get dressed and do something useful.  I don't know if it's because I was feeling so well and now with the radiotherapy looming, it seems like I'm been dragged back into the world of cancer.  I know I'm being highly dramatic, but wondered if anyone else has felt like this with treatment coming up? I'm also very conscious that there are people who have had it worse than me and feel like I should sort myself out and give myself a mental slap around the ear.  What on earth is the matter with me?
