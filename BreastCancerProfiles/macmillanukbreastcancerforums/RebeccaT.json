      "Content": "Hello Ladies I was diagnosed last week. I've had my bone scan, Appointment with oncologist is next week CT Scan and heart echo booked the week after that. My surgeon wants me to have chemo first to shrink the tumour which is about 3cm as he will try to avoid a mastectomy, although I will lose the nipple. (The tumour is behind the nipple). Then I will be having radiotherapy. This may be a daft question so bear with me! When actually having chemo do I have to wear a hospital gown or my own clothes? Am I able to wear make-up and jewellery, (and a wig when I'm at that stage)? Can my husband be with me throughout? Will I be on a bed or in a chair? Also, how effective is the cold cap? If I still have hair loss and look patchy I will wear a wig anyway so wonder if the discomfort of the cap is worth it if I still end up with a wig. I'm a model and intend to work throughout my treatment as much as I can. I'm being open about the cancer, I'm blogging on my website about it. Finding these forums has been fantastic. Rebecca x",

As I do plan to work as much as I can, I'm beginning to think the cap may not be for me even if it allows me keep my hair. as I do have to faff with it rather...blow dry, straighteners pretty much daily and it seems this would not be a good idea. I may be doing photo shoots au naturel as I want people to see that \"sexiness\" (I'm a glamour model) comes from within and is all about attitude.

I've had an immediate Becker Implant which still needs a couple more saline inflations but all looks good so far. Radiotherapy, herceptin and tamoxifen next. I'm due to have an implant in my good breast in two or three months to even them up (I'm so tiny my surgeon couldn't reconstruct that small so I'm going up a couple of cup sizes). I'm now thinking I may as well have a second MX and recon as I must have a slightly higher chance of  cancer in the remaining breast having had it already and the thought of more chemotherapy makes me feel physically sick. (I had chemo pre-surgery to try to shrink the tumour but this didn't work). I had a hard time with chemo both with the physical side effects and the impact of losing my hair and having bad nails etc and being so incapacitated by it. I think I would refuse chemo again and that's not good. Your thoughts, please, ladies. Rebecca x",

      "Content": "When I first began chemo my nurse told me to eat a bar of chocolate a day (Green & Blacks heard of this and sent me a year's supply!) to compensate for the weight I would lose. Pffft! I only gained. I've had chemo, surgery, rads and am now on Tamoxifen while I wait for more surgery. I've always eaten very healthily but  now have to eat less. I only gained 10lb but on me, (my normal weight hovers around at just under 7 stone) 10lb looks a lot. And it's all relative, isn't it? It's about how we feel about ourselves. I am finding it much slower to lose than ever before. I've just started weight and resistance training again so hope that will help. I know I will gain once more after the next surgery. Rebecca x",

Yes, sadly she died after ten years. Her family are still so mad about this. A few days ago I told my husband I understood her decision as sometimes I feel we have had to sacrifice so much to rid me of the cancer. He said no sacrifice is too great to have me with him and when I'm thinking rationally, the same applies for me. When I was diagnosed my first thought was I'm not leaving my husband...no way, no how! So when I think clearly, ten years of life as it was (although I guess the final couple would be pretty grim) versus 30 years of life as it is now....it's a no-brainer. It's a compromise but another thirty years of his smile and his gorgeous bum, thirty years of cold crisp mornings, thirty years of fresh ground coffee...yep, I'll have that, please, albeit at a slower pace! Oh and radiotherapy will leave you shattered but it's gradual and at least if you know it's going to happen it somehow makes it easer. I've put the kettle on...fancy a cup of something? Rebecca x",

I found working again a big milestone as it marked a return to some sort of normality...albeit a different normal from before. What I do find hard is people's sympathy and kindness, it makes me cry! So I don't like it when I'm treated with kid gloves and yet sometimes I want to shout \"Ahem! Cancer patient here! Let's have some sympathy!\" A few weeks ago my son got married and it was the first time I'd seen any family for over a year. Oh my word! I was so fed up with \"Don't you look well. I'd thought you'd look really sick.\" We can't win. Emotions all over the place and unpredictable. People won't let us just come back into the world as if we'd nipped out for a loaf of bread when that's how we want it (and they won't fawn over us when we want that sometimes). I have one friend who asks in hushed tones if I'm alright...one day I may just yell \"No, I've had blooming breast cancer. Of course I'm not alright\" because I think that's what he wants to hear. His intentions are good though. I've rambled, sorry. I guess I'm trying to say it does get easier.

But my cancer was ER+ so I now have no soya nor other foods which contain soya and man, that stuff tuns up all over the place! The main culprits though are soya products and licorice but soya lecithin is common in chocolate and processed foods. With regard to your bones, there are plenty of foods rich in calcium (dark green leafy stuff, chick peas, sweet potatoes etc) and many spreads, nut milks and cereals are fortified. However, chemo and letrozole and surgically induced menopause have increased the risk of a decrease in my bone density so I have drugs to compensate. Rebecca x",

Now, after 8 months I feel far less tired though certainly not as I used to be but as said by others, it's the whole treatment which wipes us out.

I find I don't ever totally relax. We don't have the type of sofa on which I can splodge or nod off but I have found that sometimes I can nap quite successfully on the bed mid-afternoon so I just let it happen. When I used it for the pain, Tramadol used to knock me out in an instant but I don't want to go down that route now.

Seriously, just give the donation. Keep your hair.

      "Content": "The Sunday Times contacted me. Of course, they published such a teeny tiny quote that they made me sound ungrateful. http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cancer-survivors-dismiss-bravery-of-charitys-head-shave-fundraising-vfmh7btr8 Here what I actually said: It\u2019s hard to write this without sounding like a bitter ungrateful old bag! I am not that at all and am often hesitant to comment negatively lest I appear so. Fund raising is a wonderful thing and lord knows, without it I wouldn\u2019t be here today but sometimes people get it wrong. Macmillan raise vast amounts and for this I am truly grateful but the wording this time was wrong. There is nothing brave about shaving your head! I understand it\u2019s something people frequently do in support of friends or family and that Macmillan felt it would be an opportunity missed but that word BRAVE\u2026no, it\u2019s not. Shave your head, shave your eyebrows, pull out your eyelashes, endure surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and all the never ending, permanent side effects of treatment and even that\u2019s not brave. We have no choice. It\u2019s that or die\u2026not much of a choice.   This is what I wrote in the Macmillan forum:   I hate the campaign. There is nothing brave about shaving your head and I love the term \"hero martyr\". When I see people doing this I want to say \"Oh cool, well done. Now you need to have six months of chemo and surgery...not so brave now, huh?!\" I'd rather people just gave the money. When these brave souls look in the mirror do they see a shaved head, money raised and even feel a little smug? When I looked in the mirror I saw a life threatening illness. I was not aware of the Marks and Spencer Bra Strap campaign so I looked it up. Hmmm\u2026I should think it was very upsetting to those women who no longer have anything to put in a bra. Even reconstructions (as I have) don\u2019t sit well in a bra. On top of all this, the nature of social media can make it all so much worse. The \u201clook at me\u201d culture, the filtered selfies really rub it in. It\u2019s easy to take a selfie of your pretty bra strap, with your hair looking lovely and your skin soft and dewy. It reminds us of what we\u2019ve lost. Also, the amount of people joining in with trending hashtags, contributing nothing is galling. I do not wish to sound bitter nor ungrateful but if I sound resentful, I am. I cannot stress enough how grateful I am to people who raise money for research and care. Twenty years ago my cancer may well have killed me. Because of these generous people I saw my son get married, I had coffee in the garden at 6.00 am today, I will have another forty years of garden mornings with my wonderful husband (I fully intend to reach 100!) But please, don\u2019t rub it in. Don\u2019t remind me, don\u2019t make me feel a lesser woman. During my treatment I wrote this on my blog: Not angry\u2026 I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s not anger I feel, nor injustice, nor even WTF? but resentment. A couple of months ago I was unaware that I had breast cancer. I was fit and healthy, stupidly happy, had reached a very good turning point in my work and was loving it. Finances had been tight but TB and I were just getting it all sorted. Life was blooming good! I think a lot of us keep quiet about feeling like this because we should just be grateful for our treatment (and I am) but I hate that my life has been changed FOREVER. I loved it just the way it was, thank you very much xx I am a big believer in Pay it Forward and two or three times a year I donate a portrait for a charity to auction. This makes me feel good, very good but never brave.   Regards Rebecca",

      "Content": "Thank you, all Misty, although I am the non-parent I am very involved in all aspects of their lives, which I love. It's me my step son comes to first and I'm honoured that he trusts me above others. Looking for attention seems obvious but it's only when she does that that she doesn't get it! We've found successful ways of dealing with her fake moods...even she laughs about it afterwards. Oh and yes, she's a child...why would a doctor give a child Prozac? What does fill me with horror is someone so young starting on any drug before uttering a single word to a counsellor. LittleGem we are familiar with CAMHS as my step son was declared by his mother to be \"not normal\" and she insisted he be assessed for ADHD and behavioural problems. He was assessed as being an intelligent, highly inquisitive, confident ten year old with no ADHD or behavioural problems. But the assessor did suggest his mother seek counselling for her anger! A big part of me believes my SD is feeling left out as her brother was the centre of attention and now her mother is getting attention. She has always loved having something wrong to moan about (some people are just happy like that, aren't they?) and I think this may well be a cry of wolf that has had consequences. But I won't dismiss the possibility of depression, I just HATE the immediate use of drugs. My husband suggested I ask you ladies as he knows how you all tell it like it is. The children live with their mother and if we decide to ask that the drugs be withheld, he wanted a little back up, so to speak. By the way, I do hate the term step child....it sounds so unaffectionate and I love them deeply. Please, do still let me know what you all think. Is drug therapy the norm these days or am I right to be concerned? Rebecca x",

      "Content": "This is rather off topic but I know you ladies pull no punches and will give me your honest opinions. My thirteen year old step daughter, whom I adore and who adores me, is a bit of an attention seeker and a \"wallower\". She seems to enjoy things going wrong for her and has been known to make this happen so we all rally round and say \"There, there\". That's a very simple description of how she is, but I'm sure we all recognise this trait. When she forgets to be miserable she is fun, delightful company and has a wonderful time but of course, she prefers the attention, although as we all see through the ruse she doesn't always get it. She googles everything and has all the symptoms she reads about (as does her mother and grandmother!). She decided she is depressed...google told her.  Now, we didn't shrug this off as depression is a serious matter. Her mother took her to the doctor who has referred her for counselling, which I think is good but has also, immediately, given her Prozac, which I think is very very NOT good! Surely, counselling first to assess whether or not she is suffering from depression then to help her resolve it and if that fails then a little help from drugs. But drugs right from the start? If she was my daughter I would change doctors. I'm familiar with the awfulness of depression and the efficacy of Prozac but also I have seen bad results. Am I over-reacting? Rebecca x",

I had small breasts, 32A and even the smallest implant was bigger do my surgeon was always going to augment the other one. I about a second MX; I thought if I'd had breast cancer once I was more likely to get it again. My oncologist said this wasn't so and wouldn't sanction the MX for that reason but was happy to sanction it for cosmetic reasons. It gave me a better match and as a model that's important to me. I'm now 32C. The first new breast (Bruce) was zapped with radiotherapy so sits higher then the second (Willis) and is much firmer...almost solid...I could have someone's eye with it! He looks as though he is permanently in a push up bra, so when I do where one, they are well matched. Even without, they're not so bad. With regard to nipple recon, my surgeon was able to leave my areolas with the idea of using those to make the nipples then tattoo new areolas around them. But I have some sensation in them and I will lose that if I go for recon. So I've chosen to leave them as they are. There are photos and all  complete account of my treatment and recon on my website, there's a link on my profile. If you'd prefer a \"safe for work\" version just let me know and I'll send you a link. Rebecca x",

I was told this is because my breasts are small and dense and the nerves are all very close together. On Thursday I'm having a coil marker placed against the lump so, I shall be having a double dose again. But because I know how painful it will be I'm already getting nervous. I know being anxious will make it worse so I'm wondering if I could take some co-codamol before the appointment (or Jack Daniels!)",

If you're comfortable using toys, a small vibrator (you don't need to switch it on) and a little lube is a great start. You're in control of it and that makes a huge difference to how relaxed you are. Also, one trick is, how to put this without being too graphic...when you meet with resistance, try pushing it out with your vaginal muscles as you ease it in. Trust me...it really does work!

General anaesthetic, overnight stay, negligible discomfort and hardly visible scars. Yesterday I had my Becker implant filler ports removed under local anaesthetic. The side which hadn't received radiotherapy was quick and painless. The radiotherapied side had me on the ceiling and very vocal. My surgeon said the rads had caused adhesion of the port. The amount of anaesthetic is based on body weight; I weigh under seven stone and the amount I was given just wasn't enough. My surgeon did give me several top ups, took me over the limit and eventually I felt nothing. But Jeez...that was some pain! So,  a heads up to any ladies planning this removal...be prepared. I think the fact I was expecting a simple, pain free proceedure made it worse for me. All surgery is now complete. Four more Herceptins and a few more years of Tamoxifen/Letrazole. 18 months of crap but all so worth it. Rebecca x",

All has now been removed, repaired, reconstructed and I am almost as fit as I was before. AND YET!!!! My elbow hurts a little at the moment (no doubt due to the weight training I have resumed) but my stupid head keeps hinting at cancer in my bones. I had a CT scan and bone scan before treatment started and all was fine. But I still worry. I get fleeting moments of panic. I really don't think I'll ever lose that and will simply have to learn to live with it. As for the guilt, I understand that. Last week we attended my husband''s godfather's funeral...cancer beat him. This whole cancer thing is a bag of bollox! But it does get easier to deal with. My life is good again now. It's a different sort of good but it is good. And yesterday, I went to a friend's daughter's 8th birthday party and then afterwards went to the pub with a handful of friends...my first visit to a pub in over a year!

I have friends with chronic, degenerative illnesses (MS, AS, MND) and they will never improve. I thank my lucky stars I only had cancer. \"I only had cancer\"...not a sentence I ever thought I'd say. I guess, what I'm angry at is that I loved my life just the way it was. Now it's different. It's still blooming good, but I didn't want it to change and feel I lost control for a while.

The first, Bruce, always looks as though he is in a push up bra. The second, Willis looks much more natural but clothed, they look fabulous! Unclothed I think the difference is very noticeable but others tell me it is not at all. Rebecca x",

I make my living from my breasts and it took me some time to accept I was going to lose one and therefore lose my income. As it happens, I've chosen to lose both as my reconstruction is excellent and a second mastectomy will give a better match and I WILL continue to work. But it was just one of many considerations, many emotions, panics, adjustments, impacts that I had to deal with. With regard to your boyfriend's comment, a lot of people think like him. They have more sympathy for the young or the attractive. But I do think, as you say, having been through this with you he should have thought before saying it. It's a real shame for all of us.

A couple of months ago I was unaware that I had breast cancer. I was fit and healthy, stupidly happy, had reached a very good turning point in my work and was loving it. Finances had been tight but TB and I were just getting it all sorted. Life was blooming good! I think a lot of us keep quiet about feeling like this because we should just be grateful for our treatment (and I am) but I hate that my life has been changed FOREVER. I loved it just the way it was, thank you very much xx   Two years later I still feel that resentment. The cancer took away so much more than my breasts but somehow I mostly carry on almost as if nothing happened. But sometimes I scream and stamp and want to hurt the whole world. Rebecca x  ",
