      "Content": "I cannot tell you what to do, only what I myself am doing.  I am 73 so there are perhaps different reasons.  I was diagnosed just before Christmas with Pagets disease of the nipple, which had been present, but mis-diagnosed since June 2017.  The current delay has been for heart checks prior to surgery which should be this week, I hope.  It is hard to even think of myself as a cancer patient, but I am!  I have decided t go with bilateral mastectomy; there is a 10% chance of it showing up in the other breast and I dont even want to think about it again.  I have a very large bust and am actually pleased at the prospect of being able to go braless at last!  I think I have to wait for post op biopsy to know if I can exhale, I believe it to be non-invasive but.....A girlfriend of mine had the gene for breast cancer which she pre-empted with a bilateral also.  I think for you, you just have to take your doctor's advice and get a second opinion if you are still unsure.  I coud have had partial with radiation, but I have seen my husband through radiation and there is damage to the blood supply which limits future options so preferred not to.  Your hubby is clearly not concerned with THAT loss only the possibility of losing YOU; a good man.  Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Your post rang a chord.  I was diagnosed with Paget's 6 days before Christmas; but it had been there since June and was variously, wrongly, diagnosed and treated before that.  I am supposed to have a double mastectomy next week, but I am 73 and a bit overweight so that are doing profound heart checks first apparently I have some slightly blocked arteries and I hope to know more today.  I may have to have balloon angioplasty first but I just want the cancer off, out, away!  Various scans showed no lumps but the biopsy showed malignancy so I am hoping it is in the milk ducts only and not invasive but I don't know.  I have always been too large up top and quite like the thought of going braless, apparently reconstruction is not an option for me because of the length of time I would be under anaesthetic.  Finding out about all this good stuff is a bit of a shock to the system even though it is good to know.  I veer between being very funny, pragmatic, and weeping. I live 5,000 miles away from Britain so not so much access to support that I know of. I look after my 85 year old husband and have seen him through stage 4 metastatic melanoma to full recovery but his mind is going now and have just got a live in carer.  The point being my husband is not so much support. One of my son's is, and my step-daughter but don't want to burden them.  HELP, please.",

A relief to have made a decision and here is where I will have all possible support and I think that is good for healing.  So can I bawl now or wait for later.......",

      "Content": "So you had it exactly the same length of time as me, and it has not spread.  That is actually a relief of sorts, I read somewhere that it was slow growing so that must be true.  Also that is very often diagnosed late as it is mistaken for something else as happened in my case. Pathology here takes ages to come back so it will be two weeks or more after surgery before I know if mine has spread, although I imagine the surgeon will have an inkling.  Nothing showed in a mammogram and CT scan, no lump, no calcification, nothing, just DCIS cells. So I have a week and embarking on a mini fitness programme, off to swim my 50 laps. Hope you are now feeling less pain. Lots of love, Erica",

      "Content": "Mavi Hi!  I was diagnosed 6 days before Christmas and was supposed to have surgery this Monday but the applecart tipped a little when they decided to check my heart, then check it again, then more checks.  So I wait to hear but am not so good with the waiting I want that thing OUT OF ME!  I have never thought of myself as a potential cancer patient, none of my family except one cousin have had it, a ton of other things but not cancer.  CANCER...ME?  It took me a good couple weeks to get my head around it, during that time I didn't want anyone to know - I had organised a family Christmas with seventeen staying in the same house so would not have wanted to cast a shadow over that anyway.  I think of myself as practical and pragmatic and I am but when people are kind to me I lose it, and occasionally when by myself I just bawl.  But bawling won't cure it or help much either, although I say to myself I am ALLOWED to cry if I want.  I am so so glad to have found this site, it does help to talk to those in the same boat and I hope to find out more about my specific type of cancer which is Paget's disease of the nipple.  Good luck to you. xo",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, Yes I know exactly, someone who knows!  How long did you have Pagets before it was diagnosed?  Today I was given the date for my surgery, next Tuesday the 6th, my mother's birthday lol. I live in Jamaica and am not aware of any support groups here but this McMillan site is wonderful and found another US one as well.  Have had so many questions answered not sure any are left n the list for the doc.  I was cool with losing both breasts but as the time grows nearer I find I am getting the flutters a little.  I cannot have reconstruction, not now anyway, I am 73 and a little overweight so they want me under anaesthetic for as short a time as possible.  I can decide if I want it after, I just am not sure how I will feel, glad or sad - I am 42DD so to some extent it will be a relief. I hope you are feeling a lot better and not having too much pain. Much love, Erica",

      "Content": "Well, I had my double mastectomy on Tuesday Feb 6, delay was due to the doctors wanting more detailed heart checks; I am 73 and a little overweight. I was quite glad to wake up in recovery, had a sort of euphoria, little pain, and huge energy.  Going to write a short story about all the hysterical events of the week but not here and now.  I turned out to be allergic to Pethedine and morphine so the biggest challenge was pain management.  Home since Monday, drains came out Sunday but a lot of fluid is becoming uncomfortable, see doc tomorrow. My question is: IF the post op biopsies are clear ( please, God) what is the percentage risk of the Paget's returning?  Is it zero?  Or is there still a risk?",
