Take care xxx",

I'm going to be thankful that the chemo was relatively kind to my body,  I'm going to believe that the chemo is doing its job even if I can't feel it and I'm going to give my children and husband a 'normal' Christmas.  All the negativity can go in a box until the 30th when I get my scan results and see the oncologist.  I think that People with 2 x grade 3 lumps, possibly no node involvement, have survived this horrible disease and so can I.   I really hope I can continue with this thought over Christmas.  Jo xx",

      "Content": "So today I am 44 years old.  The 'gifts' I experienced today were: A complete meltdown at 7.30 that it was my birthday and the multi agency team were meeting today to decide on what I have and what is going to happen to me A call to the Macmillan nurse who reassured me that there would be a course of treatment for me, the 5cm tumour and 2cm tumour weren't the end of everything and there is hope. Another meltdown that if I have chemo it may not work and then I'm left with nothing Another meltdown that there wouldn't be any mastectomy bras or inserts for a 38JJ cup A final meltdown where I was convinced everything would have travelled round my body by now. Then I remembered that my real gifts were: Gorgeous cards and pressies from my lovely husband and boys 4 birthday cakes A lovely Chinese takeaway An evening spent with my family, (punctuated by trips to the toilet for meltdowns) Not the best birthday I've every had by any stretch of the imagination but I am blessed with things that have nothing to do with my current situation.  Now to steel myself for my appointment on Wednesday. I then remember that all of these meltdowns are based on a very incomplete picture and we don't even know what we are dealing with apart from that 'it's big and looks very suspicious but the armpit looks clear'.",

I'm having chemo first in the hope of shrinking my lump ready for a WLE but if this doesn't work I was worried about mastectomy, not for fear of losing my breast but of being lopsided.  I'm a 38jj (but I've lost a stone since my dx so probably a bit smaller).  My bmi is over 30 but I'm very active and I think in proportion(!) but from what you've said I'd probably wouldn't be offered recon.  I'm not worried about being flat but If I was losing one breast it would probably help my balance to lose the other one too but I doubt they'd agree to that for that reason.  I have plenty of time to research and to watch what happens to my lump but it is something that's been playing on my mind.  Jo xx",

I'm constantly on the forum, partly to look for people with a similar diagnosis who are doing so well and coping with treatment, and partly because I don't feel so alone when I'm on this forum.  I haven't started treatment yet so that is worrying me (I'm being unreasonable here as I was only diagnosed on Wednesday!). Having chemo first then surgery. Everyone responds differently and you are experiencing shock.  I've experienced a roller coaster of emotions and there have been moments when I've forgotten completely but then it hits me again.  You are going through a terrible time but you can do it because you have to for your beautiful family.  I'm here if you need me.

I'm not in pain at all, it's just a little uncomfortable and isn't getting worse.  I've read that it can cause chemo to be delayed or the dose reduced.  I definitely don't want this to happen.  Does anyone have experiencec of this?

Does it hurt?  How long did you wait to be seen and get the results?  Ideally I'd like results prior to surgery so that if it's positive I can have everything at once.  If it's positive what does that mean?  Any information would be appreciated as I don't want to google. Thanks jo xx ",

I've been economical with the truth and said I found a lump and that I've had it tested but I'm waiting to find out what it is. I've said that I'd probably have to have a small op to remove it and said that I'm not worried so he shouldn't be. Now I'm being overly bright and breezy but screaming inside. This is horrendous.

Just before dx I started my dream job as a headteacher and I managed to work through treatment with reduced hours.  I\u2019m fitter, healthier and thinner than I\u2019ve ever been.  I have finally achieved a healthy work life balance and spend lots more time with my family.  BC was a horrible shock and a really difficult time but for me it really was the wake up call I needed to really change my life.  This forum was a life saver in the early days and I still pop in for a visit now and then to see how people are doing.  I\u2019m on holiday this week in a very wet Wales so have had time to read more posts.  So apart from the odd worry worms about recurrence I can really say that I am feeling really good.  If you\u2019re just starting out then I can remember how you are feeling and it does eventually come to an end.  Then it\u2019s time to live your life again and make the most of every moment. With best wishes to you all. Jo x",

Waiting for biopsy results. I'm convinced my lump is growing (rationally it is probably bruised from the biopsy). I'm convinced the news will be terrible next Wednesday due to size and they won't offer treatment. I'm ready to fight anything but what if they say it's too big to do anything about. I can't speak to anyone else about these fears as I feel it is all my fault. I check my breasts regularly but thought it was just the ligaments in my very large breast hardening as they travel south. I'm a 38 JJ. I went to doctors when I felt the lump but I've obviously missed for ages as its so big. It isn't really a lump but an oblong. Now I'm feeling all sorts of aches and pains that weren't there two days ago. The wait is awful. I can't think of anything else and trying to be normal around my children is so hard.
