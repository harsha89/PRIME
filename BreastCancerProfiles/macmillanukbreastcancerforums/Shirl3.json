I was diagonosed on sept 8th. Started treatment 5 weeks later fir 13th of all days. First chemo waiting 3 hours before treatment so drained before I even started. Next day started with a headache which got worse, had some chest pain so ended up at a&e overnight then transferred to the hospital where I was having treatment. Ended up having a ct and mri scan to rule any bleed on the brain, luckily came back clear. Everything had caught up with and was put down to stress and anxiety. Ended up back in after being home a week with headaches back. Given meds which have help. 2nd session of chemo was ok till 4 days after then started with dizziness and shivering. Ended up in as thought it might be an infection, luckily it wasn\u2019t. Turned out chemo meds are to strong for me and my body can\u2019t cope with it so next time they will reduce the meds.
