I went out for afternoon tea on Sunday for my sister-in-law's birthday.  I wore my wig and got so hot I felt positively unwell.  Back to sunhats or lightweight caps for me now. Good luck for tomorrow.  We can do this. Sandy",

      "Content": "A positive note of encouragement for anyone currently going through EC. I have just completed 4 rounds of EC and had my mid way MRI before the next stage of my treatment, which will be 12 x weekly paclitaxel with three weekly herceptin and petuzumab.  I am having chemo before surgery as I have multi focal grade 3 Her2 +++ and ER+ tumours. Yesterday my oncologist sent me an email confirming that the EC has given me a complete response.  \"Complete disappearance of the cancer in the breast and lymph node.\" Obviously this is wonderful news for me, but the reason I am posting this is to offer hope and encouragement to anyone else currently struggling through EC.  It does work and it is worth it. I had a hard time with EC.  I was hospitalised with neutropenia twice, and then the C part of the EC was reduced by 20% for the last two cycles.  I felt like I was going for a full set of side effects and there were times when I was reduced to tears and wanted to give up.  So stick with it if you are struggling through.  I still have the next 12 weeks chemo to get through, then mastectomy and radiotherapy so I am nowhere near home and dry buy it is very heartening to get good news along the way. Good luck everybody on this awful journey. Sandy",

I wouldn\u2019t insult you by pretending chemo is easy. It was tough for me. But it passed and now it\u2019s over, as it will be for you. It works. It killed all my cancer. I would advise writing off the time you will be in chemo but looking ahead to better times. It passes and then it\u2019s over. Listen to your body and rest as much as you can. And you don\u2019t yet know, but you might be one of the lucky people who sail through it with minimal side effects. You can do this. Be kind to yourself and very good luck. xxx",
