      "Content": "Hello What Happened I so agree with you and I guess it all depends on our diagnosis We are all different and some have no choice but to take these drugs I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking but.... Did your oncologist really talk to you about your prognosis and the chances of your cancer returning as mine didn\u2019t and I only saw the consultant under him who just talked about my radio therapy, to be fair I was so frightened too and a mess in my head at the time to ask the question so much was going on I couldn\u2019t cope with too much information but I do wish he had just told me straight when he told me I would be taking Tamoxifen and why as I did not get the chance again to really discuss about my options and again my reviews through my radio therapy no one really talked about the drugs or said anything about the side effects to me when I asked all I got was silence and the words yes but they are very rare. dont get me wrong the hospital and my care team were amazing so kind and caring and at the time your just focused on getting through your treatment and ringing that bell I need to ask the question about my prognosis tomorrow when I see my clinical specialist nurse and hopefully that will help me decided what I must do. I think it will be good for you to talk to McMillan nurse to get the right information about the drug your taking and let you know that it\u2019s ok for you to be concerned about the medication your taking we have every right to choose our treatment and if we feel uneasy about it be able to choose an alternative. personally I really believe in quality of life and it would be different if I were a young women with a family if I\u2019m lucky to live another 10 years I want to feel well and be as healthy as I can not put up with ten years of miserable side effects.I want the right to choose and if I decide to give it a go on a drug I will try who knows I may not have any side effects wish me luck for tomorrow. take care of yourself and keep strong I\u2019m here if you need to talk Friends and family mean well but I don\u2019t think really understand unless they have walked the same path as us on this site . Is it ever over for us and sometimes it\u2019s very hard to look forward it\u2019s always in your mind hopefully it will get better.xxx",

      "Content": "Hello what happened to me your post makes perfect sense I do so understand your concerns I think you and your friend are so right to question what medication you take and the effect it will have on you and you body  i don\u2019t think there is any thing wrong in challenging your doctors and asking questions I think quite often we are so confused worried and upset about being told we have cancer we just do as we are told and are so grateful for the care and kindness our  care team give us that we don\u2019t question just get on with it. I suffer dreadful with depression and anxiety and cos of this side effect of low moods and anxiety with Tamoxifen was so very worried it would make me much worst. Also you read such horror stories on line about it including cancer of the uterus my two sister were both on it and there side effects dreadful and with my oldest sister cancer returned in her other breast so no wonder I have been having nightmares about taking it. Since my treatment ended and I am due to start Tamoxifen the fear became so great that I decided to ring the McMillan help line number for helpthey were amazing so understanding and helpful put me on to a nurse who I could really talk to who understood about me struggling she told me my care team should have a specialist nurse I could go and see and this is what I have done going to see her on Monday to talk about an alternative two friends of mine are on ANASTROZOLE and the nurse I spoke to said the side effects of this drug are much better yes there is the bone thinning which is a worry but they give you supplements and a thing calle ZOLENDRONIC Acid which help the bones they also give you regular bone density scans. I am going to ask about this drug tomorrow I think you really have to weigh up the side effects and the benefit of the drugs take your time discussing it with your nurse. If you are not happy say so and try and find out as much as you can why don\u2019t you ring the McMillan line I\u2019m so glad I did and ask to speak to a nurse who will understand and try to ease your worries you can ask her about your concern about the drug you are taking my brain has been like jelly all through this having such a hard time making myself heard about the way I feel but since talking to McMillan it has helped so much.I wasn\u2019t even aware I had a specialist nurse to talk to Good luck my friend let me know how you get on and remember keep asking questions and do what you feel is right for you.xx ps the ask expert on this site is very good to and the nurse sent me links to good websites that were a help .So glad I joined this site it\u2019s so nice to speak to other ladies that understand.",

      "Content": "Hi Im now four weeks post rads and waiting to see once again my oncologist nurse to discuss which hormone therapy is right for me as I was prescribed Tamoxifen which I refused to take due to side effects and the funny thing is my nurse couldn\u2019t figure out why I was prescribed it in the first place as she said it\u2019s mainly for younger ladies not me who is well past the menopause and about to hit 60 sob! can any one out there advise me about ANASTROZOLE as I\u2019m thinking of joining that club! I have a friend who has been taking it for 5 years with very little side effects just wondered if any one out there has positive things to say about it too I have struggled so much with the fear of taking these drugs cos of the side effects. The only thing that gives me doubts about taking it is the bone thining side effect as I suffer with neck and spine arthritis so gonna ask for a bone density scan if it\u2019s agreed it\u2019s the one for me. I know Tamoxifen is supposed to protect your bones but it\u2019s not for me. As my cancer is low grade my nurse did suggest about going down the healthy life style route with no drugs but I think I should give ANASTROZOLE a trial at least then I can say I tried cos of course I\u2019m worried about the cancer returning as all 3 of my sisters have had breast cancer one with secondaries and she was on Tamoxifen. Seems to me your damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t..",
