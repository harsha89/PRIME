      "Content": "I took my bra off the very night of surgery last week. I use a small cushion between my side and arm to support my breast and that has worked well for me (stops my breast flopping to the side). I have to lie on my back to sleep using the cushion but that's ok. As I am quite busty anyway, I always wear a bra during the day as I hate not being supported. I bought an M&S sport bra which has been brilliant. It doesn't have any seams over the cup area, is made from a soft neoprene type fabric and zips up the front. I could only find it in purple but it has been the best. Buy a back size and cupsize larger than your usual size. Good luck getting comfortable.",

      "Content": "I was sitting at my breakfast table reading these posts not really realising that I am a success story! All of a sudden it hits me that I have been so very lucky. Two years ago today I was waiting for my second breast surgery and had my treatment plan to follow in the months ahead.At the time it was a terrifying prospect and now I find it hard to believe that it was actually me that went through that whole process which probably sounds quite odd!! Automatic pilot took over and I more or less handed my life over to my medical team. They were all amazing and I will be forever grateful for the care I received and to my Macmillan nurse for being there. Today I have a scar along my right breast as a reminder but I hardly even notice it any more. It has become a part of who I am. One year ago I had no idea I would meet an amazing man who I have fallen head over heels in love with and we are now in the process of planning ahead to buy a new home and make a life together. I have a new outlook on life as a result of having cancer and in a strange way I think it has made me a better person. Who knows what lies ahead one year into the future but I am ready to face it head on and make my life as positive as possible. Yes, I really am incredibly lucky and grateful.",
