Already had a surgery and my cancer was removed completely. For chemo , my oncologist did Oncotype Dx and Li-67. my Oncotype Dx recurrent score 26 and Ki67 is 11%. so want to know whether chemo will be beneficial in my case. ",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for your reply. I had been recommended not have chemo by my oncologist. As you have mentioned that we are not experts so I have decided to go-ahead with the decision of my oncologist. Hope all works fine for me. Now I am having my radiotherapy treatment alongside with Tamoxifen.",
