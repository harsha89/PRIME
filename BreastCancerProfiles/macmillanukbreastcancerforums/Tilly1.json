      "Content": "Hi Sarah I agree with Julia that you should ring your bc nurse. I had a haematoma, which is a blood clot and fluid and can give you flu like symptoms too, shortly after surgery. it couldn't be drained manually so i had surgery again to remove it (I was still in hospital at the time) that's not to say the same procedure will happen to you though. A couple of weeks later I had more fluid drained manually by my nurse, it was still a bit swollen after but felt so much better.  I hope you can get it sorted and please let us know how you get on.  Tilly xx",

There are many people on here that will totally sympathise and support you so you are not alone. I always like to put a brave face on bit sometimes we can't always do it so why not let your family know how you really feel? Or if not could you join a support group or arrange counselling with your doctor/BCN? Nobody should have to go through this horrible nightmare without some kind of support. Coming on to this site will hopefully be a big help as I'm sure you will get lots of advice and support From all of the lovEly people on here.  Another big hug to you tilly xx",

I still need to have an insert as my boobs are not the same size but this is fine for now. Perhaps you can try a different size or maybe even take the wire out of your normal bra So you can still wear your size? Not all my bras were mastectomy bras, as long as there was enough of the bra to cover the softie and hold it in. Hope this is of some help to you.  Tilly xx",

Again I have been lucky in that my work have been very supportive and still are (I need more time off next year for more ops) but they were very insistant that it was all done through the correct procedure ie: occupational health. i wasn't allowed back until I seen an occ health nurse and they had to assess me, we agreed on my hours of work and I was also offered counselling. As cancer patients we are covered by the disability act so that there is no discrimination so if you need time off for more ops then it shouldn't be a problem.

I would speak to your manager at work who should be referring you to occ health through your hr system.

You are doing the right thing by just having time wih your family to let things sink in. no matter how positive and strong we all try to be the tears still come, even now after a year I can still have tears.

The staff were wonderful though and I did feel very well looked after. when you go in to hospital they just take over and I had every step explained to me, the anaesthetist was chatting say and then the next thing I knew my nurse was waking me up.  I was lucky in that I could have an immediate reconstruction but after nearly a year it's still ongoing (had a few problems that delayed the process) I've still got a couple more ops to have but I try not to get stressed and take one day at a time.
