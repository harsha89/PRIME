      "Content": "thank you for replying it seems every appointment iv had its always more bad news, as first i was told it was DCIS and very treatable, then after i had the lumpectamy it turned out to be grade 3 aggresive cancer, and now with the lymph nodes not looking good i think iv gone into shock. i think i do need to talk to other people that are or have gone through this that understands the emotions.",
