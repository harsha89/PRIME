    "Content": "Hi I use the make 'shock absorber' (cheapest I found on amazon) which I used pre-op but I was also asked to by my surgeon. At first I noticed a little discomfort but once the exhaustion set in I stopped noticing and now I don't notice anything.  I also wear a t-shirt that says 'Yes it's fake because my real one tried to kill me!
