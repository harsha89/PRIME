      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief and Lainy r, Thanks ever so much for the oncotype graph.  I''ve decidedvthat if intermediate, I'll opt for no chemo. If high, then decision made for me really.  I've read your bio Elaine, and I'm in the same situation as you were but my 20 mm tumour was 57 mm when removed plus a bit more as 2nd op was needed as margins weren't clear. Hence been upgraded to a 3. Good news is clear margins now & lymph nodes clear.  The wait for oncotype dx is awful, but hopefully get results this Thursday.  I've been sitting at home since surgery & between appts doing nothing, putting on weight, not exercising & feel tearful & miserable. Before this, I was travelling to work & back 4+ hrs each day, in a very stressful job & getting home about 8pm each night. A very busy life, now on hold hold waiting for results  from week to week. Can't focus on anything.  Also feel guilty that my situation isn't the same as others here, who are facing huge battles. I'm an all or nothing person, and am in limbo until I know my full treatment plan. I know it's radiotherapy & letrozole,  but hope not chemo too. I'm such a wimp! I read today about a new test called Endopredict,  not yet approved by NICE but available privately. It's supposed to give a more accurate prognosis & prediction score. I'm going to mention to my Oncologist on Thursday. Have you heard of it? My surgeon has been draining my underarm each week where nodes were taken for biopsy. It fills up quite quickly & is the size of an egg.  Does anyone know if this will eventually stop? Glad to hear you're having a fabulous break Elaine. Hope to follow suit as soon as I can plan. Thanks for listening xx",

If you read my bio, I think our results were similar, except the size of our lumps differ.  I had private health care too, had the oncotype with a result of 11, which recommended that chemo wasn't  needed.   Two lumpectomies,  15 sessions of radiotherapy, 10 yrs Letrozole. Diagnosed Sept 2016. My Oncologist said I could have chemo if I wanted but as the Onco Dx result suggested it wasn't needed,  i.e. there would be no tangible benefit, I opted not to have it. Please don't get anxious. If you are worried,  perhaps speak to your Oncologist? All the best, x",

Saw my Oncologist for first appt. three weeks ago & I took out my six months HRT supply & asked if I should still take them.  His face was a picture, he said \"how did you manage to get these past a surgeon & two anaesthetists?\". He grabbed them and said, you're never to take them again. At that point I'd had two surgeries in two weeks, having recently been diagnosed so it was all a whirlwind. Now of course I know that my cancer loves estrogen,  and I'm learning lots from you ladies.  I have a fan on throughout the night & windows open too.  My hot sweats come with a Brucie bonus called brain fuzz. The other day I took some recycling to the supermarket, got out and the  car rolled slowly forward. Oh my God,  I dived into the car and pressed the hand brake. Thank goodness it wasn't a steep incline.   I was also trying to explain how I like my eggs and the word just wouldn't come to me. I could see poached eggs but couldn't find the name.  It's happening more & more, maybe it's this roller  coaster I'm on! Should I be worried or try some mind puzzles to exercise my saggy brain Off to hairdressers this afternoon to give myself a bit of pampering to take my mind off the weight I've put on!
