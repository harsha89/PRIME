    "Content": "I've just finished 6 cycles of FEC and like you, felt fine before hand.  Everyones symptoms are different but my oncologist told me to be as active as possible to be fit for the next round!  To me, the symptoms felt like a hideous hangover combined with flu but only for a day or 2. I walked every day (except treatment day and the day after) even if it was a somewhat feeble potter at first and just kept going.  The steroid gave me the worst side effects but that was only for 3-4 days each cycle.  The first is the worst as you don't know what to expect but then it becomes routine in a not very pleasant way! You'll be fine and before you know it, out the other side with extra bounce in your step! Good Luck with it all",
