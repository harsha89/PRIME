      "Content": "Hi Gaynor. Yes, my temperature was consistently low throughout my chemotherapy treatment but I believe you need to worry more about it rising too much. It is important to check temperature regularly, which is why TPR rounds are done on hospital wards.  You know your own body so if things just don't feel right and you are worried please don't hesitate to contact your breast cancer nurse to put your mind at rest.  Chemotherapy is not pleasant I know but hang in there. Approximately a year ago I was going through the same thing, I felt terrible and I thought it would never end but of course treatment does eventually finish and the good news is that I feel absolutely fine now. ",

I won't lie, I felt worried and nervous wondering whether I had made the right choice. It is up to you of course but I would grit your teeth and accept all the chemo they want to give you if you can possibly stand it.

Instead make a point of reading all the positive posts by the many cancer survivors who are doing really well. It is 18 months since I was given the 'all clear', I am a fully fledged \"Neddy\" (as George calls us) and even the dismal weather cannot dampen my spirits. I'm the one walking around with the big sunny smile on my face because I realise how fortunate I am and how lucky to have been given this treatment, difficult though it was getting through it at the time. Just hang in there and hopefully one day soon you will be feeling the same.",

Well guess what - radiotherapy was an absolute walk in the park for me. I had no adverse reaction at all - absolutely none. I was so surprised! (I was however allergic to the high factor sunscreen that I was told to use so I was just careful to keep out of the sun instead). I actually found it so relaxing lying there on the couch, with the radiotherapy machine gently whirring away above me, listening to the soothing background music that I nodded off a few times!
