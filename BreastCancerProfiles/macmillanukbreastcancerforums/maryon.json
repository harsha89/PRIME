      "Content": "Thank you for that. I feel reassured it's c ellulitus and not gout . they took blood to rule out gout today. When something like this happens on your affected arm you worry it's start of lymphodema.  I have my first T weds after 3 fec. I'm hoping it doesn't affect me too much as I already have dodgey hip joint and arthritis is lower disc enough to cause pain when walking.  I remain upbeat and determined to stay positive. This Trojan horse C will not infect my motherboard! I believe thats what they call nerve centres of a pc!",

Shopping I dread doing, I get breathless and sweaty,find it traumatic at times.I wasn't in best shape before but was doing gym 3 times a week to build stamina, now a simple walk is too much. I am going to speak to consultant next visit and get checked out.",

      "Content": "Hi there I complained about dryness of mouth at chemo the other day wish I had before. The nurse gave me biotene to try and what a difference it made!  It's a saliva replacement gel. It's brilliant and leaves your tongue feeling so much better. Ask for some on prescription when you go next.  As an added info, I was told by a friend to use a soft children's brush and euthymol toothpaste to minimise mouth ulcers. I have barely had any mouth ulcers since 3rd chemo. I still swill with difflam mouth wash that hospital gave me as well.  Hope this helps people. ",

But its so much better having a line in, it saves you running risk of veins in hand being damaged and makes it so less stressful having chemo. Embrace it and don't fret",
