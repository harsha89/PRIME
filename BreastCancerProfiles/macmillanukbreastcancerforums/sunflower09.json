      "Content": "Hiya you lot x you all sound like your doing real well. chemo is different for so many of us x I'm on the other side now just over a year since I finished. Scary at the time but like someone has already said, you get through it cos you know you have to x I took sweets as one of the drugs has a funny effect and made my nose tingle x and a teddy just made me feel better x there is one thing I would say, is that loosing your hair is scary but I found it helped by shaving my head when I noticed it was falling out fast, as you can't see the short hairs so much. I got pretty scarfs that I wore at home - there are ones that keep your head cold, let it breathe they are more expensive but good. I choose a long wig like my hair was before and my friends thought it was fab x I brought clips I could use it pin parts up to have different styles x  creaming is important, a pain in the back side but I got really niva plain but very soft body cream and it was very good. X comes in large tins with a blue pattern on top. X also baby creams were good as they are soft on your skin x hope this helps and ask any questions you want x my hair came back the same by the way, almost in a bob now x good luck x I'm sure you will do great x it is nerve racking, but every session is one closer to the finish line! One goal at a time x ps......staying cold free is important too! Anyone who had a cold was banned from our house! And sure enough I had all 6 on time and cold free!",

      "Content": "Hiya well my hair did come back the same colour and straight but unfortunately I've had grey hair since I was 21 and was hoping for my original brown colour to grow back x no such luck, so back to dying it x (31 now, was hoping it would save me some money) i lost some of my eyebrows and eyelashes but not completely x I bought some really good brown eyebrow powder to make them look less patchy, got it from my local beauty place, expensive but lasts forever x I still have mine now and still use it as it defines better even when they grow back x i wore fake lashes when I went out and didn't put mascara on towards the end as it makes it more obvious x although wearing eyeliner instead was good x Although good news my brows and lashes have grown back longer and thicker! And my legs are now less hairy!  Keep going and stay warm x",
