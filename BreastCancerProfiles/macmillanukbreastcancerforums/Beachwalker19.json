      "Content": "eliza44  Hello, firstly sorry for you diagnosis. Personally, I would go back for the mastectomy on the side they offered and ask about a double (no harm in asking and explaining your fears) as I was told they usually do a double mastectomy for hereditary Breast Cancer or as reasons already mentioned.  I had a left side mastectomy in October on a lobular invasive tumour.  Which was 63mm and was hormonal after tests. I decided on reconstruction at the same time, so an implant in and had 2 sentinel nodes removed, then a lymph node clearance 3 weeks later. All went well, healed ok, a bit of lymphoedema (swelling.) but that\u2019s more common in 2 ops. I\u2019m now on chemo as a precaution I could have had radiotherapy and anti hormone tablets, but when my Dr advised chemo for more peace of mind as I\u2019m only 48, I thought about it and wanted to throw everything at it. I think it would put your mind at rest if you went for the mastectomy. Wishing you all the very best, let us know how you get on x",

I\u2019ve been very lucky so far only had chemo mouth and a bit of dry skin and slightly constipated!  Cold capping so have hair atm.  When I was diagnosed in October we only told hubbys mum and sister and my two closest friend, nobody else knew. I didn\u2019t even tell my 4 children, 2 are older and live away from home. They knew I\u2019d had a lump removed but not a mastectomy. We waited till after New Year to tell them. So many things going on, my mum was ill, we had youngests bday then Christmas and I only decided to go for chemo as a precaution just before Christmas. I could also give everybody a clear picture from diagnosis through treatments.  Have told a lot more ppl now as with chemo it\u2019s pretty hard to hide. My friends have been great. Family are ok, my mum took it better than I expected but she had just had a biopsy for bowel cancer and was luckily clear but feels guilty now! She thinks it should be her, I understand because I felt like that when I was diagnosed I was just glad it wasn\u2019t any of my kids. My Two younger kids are ok getting lots of support at school and we talk about it at home.  Hubby however has found it hard he doesn\u2019t really want to talk about it, he was alright at the time of diagnosis as I think there was a goal, an aim to get through, the ops, the scans, the meetings with nurse and consultant but now he comes to chemo will me, but doesn\u2019t have much to say at home.  I know how lucky I am with the ppl I class as my true friends and because I haven\u2019t felt unwell as yet we have been able to go out for coffee or they are coming to see me when they can.  Coming here is very important for comfort, support and friendliness, someone is always here to help. I hope all you ladies will come here often x",

      "Content": "Tray46 Hello, so sorry you find yourself here. I had a left side mastectomy with sentinel nodes removed, reconstruction with gel implant too, 62mm invasive lobular tumour (Hormone receptive.) Non sparing nipple, as the lump was close to the nipple. I\u2019m 48. I also had to have a node clearance 3 weeks later. The waiting was, for me the worse bit, as silly as that sounds. As I waited for tests results from scans etc, not going to lie it was horrendous. I didn\u2019t tell our children when I was first diagnosed in October, infact I waited till after New Year to tell them, all they knew was I\u2019d had a lump removed, that was it! Not about the mastectomy or cancer. It doesn't necessarily mean bad news, my team meet on Fridays so could be the same at yours, they discuss everything then get you back, it\u2019s easy to say Don\u2019t Worry, but absolutely normal to do so though. I just tried to keep as busy as I could, my house had never been so clean! You are on an emotional rollercoaster so don\u2019t beat yourself up about feeling emotional, I could go from laughing to crying in 0.5 seconds! Answer to moving on, hard one, do you have to move on yet? Should you? It\u2019s all very early yet and I\u2019m thinking your still reeling from diagnosis and surgery, I couldn\u2019t even think clearly the first few months, it was only really in the New Year I came to terms with everything.  Get lots of support, from your breast care nurse, your gp, family etc. Let us know how you get on, wishing you well x",

No loss of appetite I\u2019ve been very lucky. I take lactose to help with the bowels .  Only two bad sides cold cap hasn\u2019t saved enough of my hair so it\u2019s super thin and big bald patch at the back!  My Oncologist said at least 80% of ppl have total hair loss with Docetaxel so eyebrows and eyelashes too, so I\u2019m prepared for that and the Filgrastim can causes hair loss and thinning too, so I\u2019ve decided tomorrow I\u2019m not going to bother with the cold cap. I have a nice wig I\u2019m happy with.  I\u2019ve taken 8 steroids tablets today and cried three times! Twice I have no idea why! I was told to take the steroids before lunchtime as I can suffer from insomnia.  Ive painted my nails, got a base coat and dark varnish from a cancer care website.

      "Content": "Pollydog  I was diagnosed with invasive lobular BC last Oct, 7 out of 21 of my lymph nodes were affected, so had clearance 3 weeks after mastectomy. My tumour was also over 5cm. I was asked about the Optima trial too. I really didn\u2019t want chemo, so thought I\u2019d just go ahead with the randomised bit of the trial and hopefully get Hormone Therapy...No, didn\u2019t happen I was told I got chemo. I was told the computer picks ppl at random, the first lot have chemo, the second have their tumour scored, if score is over 50 those ppl get chemo as well and the others have just Anti Hormone Therapy . After I was told I got chemo I told the oncologist no thanks. However after another appointment with the oncologist after Christmas, I decided to go ahead with chemo and throw everything at this. I was told like you by my surgeon the tumour was gone, all the tissue was and that he had got it all and he was very confident that was it. I have 4 Children and a Stepson, whose girlfriend was expecting a baby. My eldest daughter wants to try for a baby within the next few yrs after getting married last year and my younger 2 were only 15 and 13 and all I could think was \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t do it\u201d, I know my children need me and I would never have forgiven myself if I didn\u2019t do this. I\u2019m not sure they would either. I want to be here as long as possible. Has it been easy...No, but definitely bearable. I\u2019ve lost hair, my eyelashes are going too, I\u2019ve had nosebleeds, have to inject myself with bone marrow boosting meds, niggling little effects but I\u2019m alive! Obviously ever case is different but I\u2019m sure the oncologists do their best for each patient and they are the ones in the know.  Im 5 out of 6 chemos down now and im finding it harder since switching to Docetaxel but I don\u2019t regret my decision, I ache, feel tired, have virtually no taste, bloating etc but I know when I look in the eyes of my children, I\u2019m doing the right thing.

I told the oncologist I wasn\u2019t having it. But whether it was because it was Christmas, (I love Christmas), I just thought about Christmas in the future with my kids  and with grandkids. I decided I would go for it, I did actually change my mind again but in the end after speaking to the oncologist again I got a start date for January .  Yes Optima is a blind trial so I don\u2019t know which category I was in. The Dr doesn\u2019t even know. He said he would always recommend chemo to someone so young! (I was 48) with it having spread to the lymph nodes.   I think taste loss is temporary yes, with my 1st 3 treatments it was only the first week after chemo. But some ppl don\u2019t get this side effect.  If you want to private message me anytime it\u2019s no problem.

So I worry about the cording in the right arm as they are really struggling to do the chemo bloods with numerous attempts to draw blood with little success.  Please let me know how you get on with your surgeon next week.

Will still try and pop on when I can.  I haven\u2019t got a date for radiotherapy yet, my oncologist said it would be three weeks after chemo but he had to ask me if he\u2019d referred me! I have a meeting with a different oncologist so wether he is discussing this with me I\u2019m not sure. I was lucky I tolerated EC really well but  Docetaxel a little less with pretty bad pain after the 1st one but better on 2nd, feel tired day 4/5 for a few days aches and pains and developed Hand, Foot Syndrome last time, Doc thinks it\u2019s likely to happen again around day 10, just as I start to feel a better lol. Still positive vibes now, another hurdle over and moving forward. I\u2019ve try to keep my energy levels up by walking 4/5 miles a day most days, was going great till the Docetaxel I\u2019m too tired on the days as stated above Wishing everybody all the best for chemo and the mildest of SE\u2019s Gentle Hugs Tina x",

I think I might email my oncologist\u2019s secretary to ask about this. Regarding hair, I basically don\u2019t have much, I still wash it with the Simple range of shampoo and conditioner but I recently attended the Look Good, Feel Better session and received skincare products, make up and something for hair and scalp called Nioxin. I\u2019m giving it a couple of months to see what happens first. I still have some eyebrows but would love my eyelashes to grow back ASAP. Im using Revitalash and Revitabrow products atm so fingers crossed. Hope your radiotherapy goes well, I guess I\u2019ll be joining that thread next. Wishing you well Tina x",

Have hair loss, barely any taste left, some other minor effects, but no real poorly side effects.  Im sure your chemo team will give you info on your treatment including any other meds you might need.  They usually do your blood pressure, temp etc and will have checked your bloods if you had them done 48 hrs before. They will put you at ease, I shook all the way through my first chemo, it wasn\u2019t the cold from the cap either, it\u2019s the unknown I think.  I didn\u2019t bother with the cap from 4th treatment on, too time consuming for me, I\u2019m now in and out in less than 2 hrs.  I couldn\u2019t colour my hair so wasn\u2019t going to go out without my wig anyway lol.

Just radiotherapy to go. Hopefully regain hair and eyelashes along the way. My hands and feet are ok atm, but likely to flare up.

Seeing oncologist tomorrow so will see what happens there.  wigan59 so sorry you aren\u2019t feeling well. I can\u2019t answer your question, your body has been through a lot. It\u2019s going to take time I guess to recover. I keep thinking what a nurse said to me about when you think about being pregnant, it takes 9 months to grow a baby, so it can take 9 months to recover, get back in shape etc. She said when having chemo for 6 months, think 6 months to recover and then double it lol, I know that doesn\u2019t seem much of a consolation but I just think she means to give yourself time to heal,  it only physically but mentally too. Maybe speak to your GP or Macmillan unit if you have one close by. I\u2019d also like to know about taste as I think my taste buds have left now....I did just read an article about a lady who is rediscovering her taste buds and she said food has never tasted so good I\u2019m going to hang on to that.  Hope you start to feel better very soon.  Tina x x",

At a referral to the Breast Care Unit on 2nd October I had a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy.  The Dr spoke to me explaining he thought it was cancer. I had no other symptoms other than the lump. I\u2019m 48, so not old enough for Mammograms.  On 15th October I was back to be told it was what he expected and as lump was quite large he wanted to do a mastectomy on the Saturday 20th, he explained we could wait and decide what we wanted to do, but I was of the mind if he could do the surgery in 5 days time I was going for it as opposed to waiting.  The waiting is horrendous. I had a chest ct, an abdominal ct and bone scan to see if it had spread anywhere else as it was in the lymph nodes (I had node clearance 3 weeks after the first op.) Luckily all scans etc were clear and my breast nurse told me the results over the phone as that\u2019s what I wanted.   I didn\u2019t tell my children till after Christmas. They knew about the lump,  that we thought it was a cyst so was removed but I wanted to have give them the whole story. Telling them everything in one go, and having a treatment plan in place, made it a bit easier on them, the younger ones are 15 and 13. I didn\u2019t want them to be wondering and waiting for test results it was hard enough for us.  Wishing you all the best and I hope you get good news x",

Are you having radiotherapy?  Yes my drains were because of mastectomy and nodes I think, because I had one drain after the lymph node clearance I had 21 lymph nodes removed 3 weeks after my mastectomy as is the first place cancer can spread too.  Let us know how you got on x",

      "Content": "Hi JayJerome  So sorry to find yourself here. I had a mastectomy last October with 2 sentinel nodes removed. I was ill with the antibiotics but soon got anti sickness meds and was going ok.  I was in hospital two nights, felt tired for a few days but i wasn\u2019t in pain. I\u2019d say after the drains came out on day 14 I felt pretty much back to normal.  I got some front fastening pjs, some zip up hooded tops as it\u2019s difficult to move the arm and your not suppose to lift your arm up so I was told to keep things at waist height, no reaching up in the kitchen cupboards for a couple of weeks. You don\u2019t say if your having immediate reconstruction or not If you are, Do you have a compression bra? I was giving one of the sexy things at the hospital but bought some online in my preferred colours.  I still have some numbness in the breast area and loss of feeling under my arm but 3 weeks after my op I had node clearance so that\u2019s probably due to that. The breast area healed quickly and I had no problem with it. I had nerve damage from my underarm to my elbow and still see a physio although this is so much better, no pain in my arm now.  I wish you well, anything else you want to know, send me a message, I\u2019ll get back to you.  Hope everything goes well for you x",

      "Content": "Hi noswad1,  Firstly, So sorry you find yourself here.  Shock is I think, what most people feel. In fact when my surgeon gave me the news, he said,  \u201c You do understand what I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t you!\u201d  I think everybody will tell you, waiting for the scans and then the results is really the worse bit, because it\u2019s fear of the unknown. Please try not to worry, I know it\u2019s far easier to say than to do, try to keep busy, arrange lunch with friends, do whatever you can to try to take your mind off it for a bit. My house has never been so clean as it was when I was waiting for results. I was the same as you, I thought it would have spread, you just can\u2019t know till you get your results. Wishing you the best of luck, please let us know how you get on. Gentle Hugs x",

One to go then 3 docetaxel.  At my 2nd bloods appointment it took 5 attempts to get blood as I have deep veins apparently.  The 2nd chemo was ok but I kept getting a pain in my hand and arm they kept saying the cannula was in perfectly but I was wondering if it was the cyclophosphamide as I\u2019ve heard it can be hard on the veins, the nurse was very nice and did slow down pushing it through.  I am massaging it the arm and hand but thinking if my veins are that deep is it doing any good! So I too would appreciate any tips or suggestions. Wishing you well x",
