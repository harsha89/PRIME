Please do this nurse a massive favour and write an account of what she said and how it made you feel. Date and sign it. The next time you visit the unit give this to either this nurse or the ward manager. Say it is feedback on her practice for her to use for her revalidation.

Because they tell you things and you are so emotional you can't remember. I hope very much that these areas are benign or cysts and that is still a possibility. But if it is bad news you will find yourself on the treatment conveyor belt, you will be quickly and efficiently treated and breast cancer has excellent outcomes. Really the results and any treatment needed are completely out of your hands so there is no point in wearing yourself out with this emotion. Easier said than done I know. Now is the time to get on the phone to someone calm and reassurring and get them over for a chat after your husband has gone to work. I recently had to have a MRI of my spine and my lady vicar came round the evening before and was lovely and calmed me right down. The scan came back normal but I don't forget how scary it all is.  This time tomorrow you will know and will have a plan to sort it all out. It is scary but lots of ladies on here have been through it and come out the other side. I will be thinking about you xxxx",

Apparently it decreases the % of recurrence significantly. They give you tiny dots of tattoos to guide them and that is the only lasting thing I have from the radiotherapy. I had no skin damage apart  from a little  pinkness and a little rash afterwards and you get tired towards the end. To be honest it was no big deal for me.

Below is a link for a research article about it, quite heavy reading, I know, but I skip to the conclusion. Also they do creams and lozenges.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898618/  I realize supplements are not to everyone's taste and will understand if removed Love  ",

Something similar happened to me, I think they drip feed you information as they think you can cope with it. I was really upset that they had had a meeting and planned all my treatment before I even knew. However the good news for you is that you are now in a very efficient system that all these tests are being done to determine the very best treatment available for you. I know its like a rollercoaster that takes over our lives, but trust the Docs...they will sort you out..when the results are in the treatment will start..don't worry they will look after you like a princess. Test result days are the pits and my thoughts will be with you tomorrow. Remember breast cancer is very very treatable, I forget the % but its good. Ladies on here have had complete response to chemo. Hope this has helped a bit...I replied because I saw your post and did not want it unanswered. Good luck for tomorrow lots of love",

The first hat is a sort of aging hippy hat....I take Ashwagandha powder sprinkle it on my cereal and in my coffee, its about £3.49p its a central nervous system relaxant...and obviously more relaxed = less pain. https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ashwagandha Curcumin is an natural anti inflammatory and I also take this, its for the Letrozole aches and pains, I will put a link up for this  https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/turmeric Right the second hat is a nursing cap. As a previous writer has said for nerve pain they can prescribe Amitriptyline, this used to be prescribed for depression but now found to be useful for nerve pain, this also works on the central nervous system, Gabapentin is another one. At the moment you are on medication for mild-moderate pain the reason they are reluctant to put you on moderate-severe pain meds is of course the side effects. The next step up is codeine based stuff like Co-Codamol with all the constipation issues plus drowsiness. After that its morphine based stuff...Butrans patches 5mcg or 10mcg, they might be an option, maybe ask if you can try a Transdermal Analgesic Patch . Then there is Morphine sulphate tablets but there are strong side effects and you are looking after children so I don't think its appropriate. You absolutely deserve to be pain free, if it was me I would go with the natural stuff and also push the Doc for a low dose of Amitriptyline 5mg at bedtime and push to try a Butrans Transdermal Patch 5mcg. Hope this has been a bit helpful  xxx",

Everyone at that clinic was waiting for results same as me, I know this because one of the health care assistants who organise the clinic was explaining to someone why they had to wait so long. I was in the consulting room, it had a bed in it but I was sat in a chair as nobody had told me to strip off or get on the bed. Anyway I could hear the staff laughing about something and I was glad because I thought they wouldn't be laughing if they are going to come in here and tell me bad news. My surgeon came in and said straight away...'clear margins and clear lymph nodes'  they were the best 6 words anyone has ever said to me. She then said she was going to refer me to the Oncologist for radiotherapy and was going to give me a prescription for Letrozole.  I was so happy and the next day my boyfriend took me to the seaside and I had a meltdown at some pensioners but that is another story..",

So I did thanks to great friends on here and Whathappened in particular who made me laugh telling me her funny MRI stories and giving me lots of support.

I was thinking maybe the lump is hormone related due to the hormonal upheaval of pregnancy? Of course the doctor is doing the best thing sending you to the breast clinic to get it checked out due to your history. If your worst fears are confirmed and that hasn't happened yet...it will be another primary diagnosis and treated as such. As your know from experience the waiting is the worse thing, made worse by your hormone levels which must be all over the place. Try and keep calm, nothing has been diagnosed yet, when you pick your daughter up from school give her a big hug and spend some lovely time with her xxx ",

I am sure someone more knowledgeable than myself will come along and direct you to it. Thank heavens for the Anastrozole, so glad it seems to be doing its job....helping you get on with day to day activities, you are obviously a lady who views her glass as half full rather than half empty.

I didn't tell the staff at the radiotherapy center what I was using and they kept saying 'isn't your skin doing well..it will break soon'...which it never did, every time I had a new radiotherapist they commented on how well my skin was holding up. So I am a big fan. It actually makes my blood boil to think it is withheld due to cost.  Print out Dreamthief's reply make several copies and give them to anyone who could write a prescription for you.

The person who tells you is a breast care nurse and what really upset me is that they already have had a team meeting to decide your treatment. So you are given a pack of information and an appointment with a surgeon and they tell you if it is ER+ that means if the tumor is feeding on estrogen, which is a good thing because its more treatable. For me and probably most people it was a horrible day, but in the end my treatment has not been too bad, just lumpectomy radiation and tablets.  I will be thinking about you tomorrow, good luck and let us know how it goes ",

      "Content": "Hi Theresa, I really hope the Exestamane works out for you and you can tolerate the side effects. If it doesn't work out there are other options. When I had side effects (from Letrozole) I looked into it and found out that very low doses of the drug wipes out your estrogen I will put a link up https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/sites/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/files/Femara.pdf daily doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg Femara (letrozole) suppress plasma concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate by 75% to 95% from baseline with maximal suppression achieved within two-three days. Suppression is dose-related, with doses of 0.5 mg and higher giving many values of estrone and estrone sulfate that were below the limit of detection in the assays. Estrogen suppression was maintained throughout treatment in all patients treated at 0.5 mg or higher.  So this article which is by the makers of Femera the original drug says that 0.5mg completely suppresses estrogen. That is 1/5th of a tablet...so I cut the tablets up and take a small piece every day. Also another option is DIM and Indole-3-Carbinol. DIM short for Diindolylmethane cruciferous vegetables including broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. It is the most studied of all I3C metabolites and is thought to be superior to IC3 as a chemoprotective compound for breast cancer. I will put a link up for the DIM as well https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/diindolylmethane  I hope you don't mind me flooding you with so much info but I didn't want you thinking you had run out of options Best Wishes",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 60 postmenopausal osteopenic women. They were divided in two groups one group were administered 1gm calcium+ vitamin D3 1 mcg /day and other group were administered 1gm calcium+ vitamin D3 1mcg+vitamin K2 45mg/day. All the patients were investigated for bone marker undercarboxilated osteocalcin, N Telopeptide and bone mineral density. RESULTS: It was observed that group I that was treat with vitamin D3+calcium had less percentage improvement in bone mineral density and reduction of undercarboxilated osteocalcin and N telopeptide in comparison to patients who were treat with vitamin K2+vitaminD3+calcium observed had more percentage improvement in bone mineral density and reduction of undercarboxilated osteocalcin and N telopeptide. CONCLUSION-According the results of this study vitamin K2 to be more effective as a protective agent than combined calcium and vitamin D3 administration in cases of osteoporosis. ",

The ER8 means that the cancer cells will starved by taking am estrogen suppressant like Letrozole (that is the one I'm on) so the ER8 is good news. The HER2- means she wont have Heceptin. I'm no expert of course. I know it's rotten having to have treatment when you have had a healthy life but many ladies on here have had chemo, surgery and radiotherapy and it is an interruption to their life, not an end, nowhere near. Personally I got away with surgery, radiotherapy and then the Letrozole for 10 years. Anyway practical things you both could be doing....probably she will be starting treatment very quickly so stock the freezer/cupboards, buy some front fastening PJs, buy some cheap  comfy stretchy bras from Asda or similar that you can step into, alert any good, sensible mates who might come round and cheer her up. Prepare yourselves for maybe 6-12 months of disruption to your lives. Make her step away from the computer and go out for a lovely lunch then persuade her to join this group. We are a friendly bunch and she could chat to women going through the same. You're a good husband, and she's lucky to have you xxx",

I understand the need to work...to contribute and be a part of life. I take Curcumin and Ashwaghanda for pain that I have in my back, they are natural anti-inflammatory and do help. Maybe you could ask your Oncologist if they are allowed. https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/turmeric https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ashwagandha Have a lovely rest this weekend. ",

At the breast clinic they will probably do a mammogram ultrasound and maybe a biopsy. Its a good idea to take a couple of paracetamol before you go because its a bit uncomfortable. Then I'm afraid its another wait for results :( waiting seems a feature...we are always waiting for something.  The result of the biopsy is what determines the diagnosis. There may be other reasons for your problems with your breast but the doctor voiced one of them and that is the one thing nobody wants to hear. You have faced up to going to the doctor and now facing up to the next couple of weeks is hard, but you have done another smart thing in coming onto this forum. Someone is here night and day, to give advice support or listen to any fears. Ladies on here have been where you are now and have come out the other side. Keep talking to us and hold on xxx",

The problem is you're now in a system like a sausage in a sausage factory.

Use this time to do the things you have always wanted to do. I have just been to London on my own looking at all the museums.  Do things that that you want to do without any timescale or limit. Time to think again if your symptoms/side effects make life uncomfortable. Money is irrelevant when cancer rears its vile head. Thinking of you and hoping for your peace of mind and calmness.  ",

What you are going through now is the worse bit, waiting for the results, its the utter pitts. When you have a diagnosis and a treatment plan at least you can get on with it. I live on my own and it was scary. I had a 12mm tumor found last summer and I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node taken out, I only had this operation and radiotherapy it was okay, though other ladies have tougher treatments to contend with. I sincerely hope the biopsy turns out to be benign but if it doesn't they will already have had a Multi Disciplinary Team meeting and decided on your treatment, this bugged me that they knew before me, but it means you can get on with sorting this out. I'm sure lots of others will soon come on and reassure you. Hang in there, this will get sorted xxx  ",

I had grade 1 stage 1 ER+8 August 2015 lumpectomy rads Letrozole.  Reason for MRI is I had bone scan in April for back pain. The scan showed loads of degenerative but also small suspicious area at Thoracic Vertebrae 7 which could also be degenerative but small focus of metatisic activity can't be entirely ruled out hence the MRI six months down the line.  In your case there are no reasons to look further. You're already on the best Al and the herceptin. If you think about it all of us who have had cancer will have had cells circulating in our bloodstream but all the doctors can do is give us drugs to starve the receptors and hope it doesn't grow in another organ.  I know it's really hard to stop worrying and enjoy life because that's what I'm trying to do myself at the moment and all I can think of is the suspicious area when today I could have had a lovely day with my fella. Try to believe the herceptin and the Al are starving and killing every cancer cell and I will try and believe the Letrozole is killing mine. Sending loads of hugs xxxc",

Take two paracetamols before you set off to your appointment because you can get a bit sore. The biopsy results are the key to finding out what treatment you might need and the waiting is awful but once they find anything you are very quickly dealt with. Lot's of ladies on here have been where you are and come out on the other side. Mine was three and a half years ago and I only had a lumpectomy radiotherapy and tablets, so not so bad. I know its no point saying don't worry, but if you come on here and read the posts it will reassure you. Sending hugs xx",

You need stronger or different type of painkiller. Codeine is rubbish.  As it is Saturday go to Boots chemist and ask to speak to pharmacist privately  and explain the situation.  The strongest over the counter painkiller is called PARAMOL it is in a black box and is mix of paracetamol and Dyhdrocodine which is synthetic morphine. It's for short term use only, this is short term and for a valid reason. Obviously rebook GP and be insistent about better analgesic. Maybe the tumour is pressing on something causing this ache.  It's not right you're in pain with all the cancer stuff to face. Sending hugs let us know how you go on xxx",

This feeling won't  last ,it is something you are going through, not something you are going to stay in forever. I was diagnosed in Aug 2015 and I stick around on this site to 'haul the newbies into the lifeboats' as Carolyn28 says. There are many stages and grades of breast cancer with different receptors which can all be treated. For example my tumour was 12mm and was grade 1 stage 1 and ER positive and I just had a lumpectomy (scar almost invisible now) 15 radiotherapy (doesn't hurt at all) and tablets for 10 years (that's another story, pain in the arse). So although it is utter poo to have the thing at all it may not be as bad as you are thinking. They don't know a thing until they have those cells under a microscope. Hold on these day's will pass and keep on posting, that is what we are here for, to haul you into the lifeboat, honestly you're not going to sink xxx ",

What happens is that they have a meeting and decide on your treatment and then when they give you the results there is a plan of treatment to give you. I myself was very cross that loads of people knew I had cancer before I did. But the reason is that a group of experts come together to give their input, years ago it would be one (often male surgeon) who would make the decision what would happen to your breast.  So is it annoying that these people know about your cancer before you......Yes very But much better to have a group of people all giving their best input and when you are told the news...then they can say...'and this is what we are going to do about it'. I am sorry you are upset...probably the breast nurse who lied to you is upset also and will be carpeted",

Absolutely worrying and scary for you but they won't know a thing until they have results, it could be unrelated. When you go on the 30th they will possibly do a needle biopsy under ultrasound (take 2 paracetamol before you go) and then if its anything to worry about you will get an appointment quite quickly and they will have a treatment plan in place. I wish I could tell you the times ladies have been on here with lumps and then there is a sigh of relief when its nothing to worry about. But obviously with the nodes already spotted its worse for you. You have done a smart thing coming on here to talk, we are here day and night, for support advice or just for you to vent.

Oh Lou...these horrid tablets I am supposed to be on Letrozole, which made me dizzy then I started getting heart bangs and booms. I'm too scared to stop em all together so taking minuscule amounts and waiting for appointment with cardiologist. So to answer your question yes go and see the doctor about it all. Another thing you could do if really worried is ring the macmillan number and speak to one of the nurses, they know all about this stuff. Good luck x ",

However if you are passed all that I cannot see any objections to a multivitamin, I take loads of supplements. Vitamin D3 and K2 and a vitamin B complex, vitamin E drops for starters. The other things are herbs or food extracts which are supposed to be cancer helpers. Oh and I take 2 spoonfuls of flaxseed and 2 cups of Rooibos tea this was okayed by the chief medical officer of the UK when there was an open forum. Best Wishes ",

I had a 12mm grade 1, stage 1, tumor taken out by lumpectomy, I had nothing in my lymph nodes, so I had 15 sessions of radiotherapy then Letrozole a hormone inhibitor tablet. I managed to work at weekends all the way through the radiotherapy, it was tiring but doable. Because I had a lumpectomy and no chemo my life has had much less disruption than many of the ladies on here who have more surgery and chemo. So I would say yes, this is a much bigger thing than flu the treatment brings changes to your body, the radiotherapy and the hormone tablets have side effects we could do without. Also there are psychological implications, you have had cancer and you will always think differently now. But I think you and I French, have hopefully dodged some of the bullets and life will soon get back to a new 'normal'.  My best wishes for the rest of your treatment, keep in touch let us know how you go on x",

I have had this pain in my pelvis it started about 6 months before the breast cancer was diagnosed, I foolishly swung a heavy trolley up a ramp and I thought the pain stared then. So its been there off and on ever since, never told anyone about it. This last weekend it got go much worse I could hardly walk, pins and needles in my toes. Went to the doctor Monday, had x-rays and bloods to be taken Thursday. So I don't know if I should continue taking the Letrozole, is it that causing the pain in the sacrolliac joint? Or is it bone mets and I've had it all along?  I'm coming to you asking these questions because I'm going to see my daughter and see her wedding dress thats just arrived and its supposed to be a happy day, and if I pour it all out to you it gets it off my chest.

I'm always having weird shooting pains in my arms, I've had it for years. I had a bone scan not so long ago and I have degenerative disc disease so probably pains are due to that. I know it is impossible to stop worrying. But I hope my little story has given you a glimmer that the shooting pain could be caused by something totally innocent. Give that lovely baby a shower of kisses and take heart that you are going to be here for his graduation in 21 years xxxx",

The boob gets a bit hot and pink and you're knackered at the end, I worked a 12 hour shift every Sat night, but it was worth it to lower the risk of local recurrence. I hope you don't mind but I put your stats in the Predict tool and you gain 0.5% chance of survival at 5 years and 1.5% at ten years by taking the tabs. I know it's not much. But to your doctor who might be seeing 200 ladies a year that means 3 more ladies survive through taking the tabs. Of course it is your body and you must do what you think best i was just putting my view forward. Best of luck what ever you decide xxxx",

You have indeed been abandoned.  By opting for palliative care rather than active treatment you deserve more than a prescription for morphine.  I'm just trying to wrack my brain how you could receive support if the hospice is not responding. The district nurses you mention are probably responsible for physical care like dressings but they are very pushed for time.  Please contact the district nurses and ask who is responsible for your end of life care plan....because you will have a named nurse and then tell them your needs, which at the moment seems to be befriending rather than nursing care.

At least you got the letter and know that the biopsy is going to give you the answers you need. When I had my ultra sound the lump looked like a little pebble on the screen it was 12mm. Because of my age (I was 52) the probability was that it was cancer and it was, but stage 1 which has very good outcomes. When you do get the appointment for your results there will have already been a Multi disciplinary team meeting, that is a group of experts will have had a meeting and discussed your results and decided on a treatment plan. This is one of the reasons for the delay in you getting the results, very annoying but it is really a good thing, because in the old days you would get one consultant, usually male deciding everything. But this is all running ahead because your results may be  benign. Meanwhile, when you have had all the scans its just a matter of waiting for the Lab report",

It is very difficult for any of us to say don't have the chemo because we would always be worried we had influenced you and then you could (God forbid) be in the 2% of women who would have benefited from it. However you are more than a statistic and your life is about much more than breast cancer, so what I am saying is only you know what is most important to you.

I am on Letrozole myself and know the nasty side effects...but it is there to protect you and me from the cancer coming back. The Statin which has recently been in the news (the other day) has been cleared of many of the accusations against it and it protects thousands maybe millions  from heart disease and strokes. The diabetic medication.... I take it you are tablet and diet controlled...is there to prevent damage to your body from the diabetes.  Most people don't like being on meds, but looking at your trio I would say they are a friendly helpful bunch. I hope this answer gives you an alternative view. I'm sorry you are having problems, stress through serious illness like breast cancer is enough to give us anxiety and memory problems.
