I am waiting to start chemotherapy to be followed by radiotherapy and 5 years minimum of daily hormone tablets. Rest when you are tired if you have kids or partner insist they help with housework , the less stress you have and the less work you do the quicker your recovery will be. Carry on with the exercises you have been given. But don't overdo them you will suffer for it if you do, but do what you can every day. Take care and rest your body needs it.",

      "Content": "I had mastectomy and all lymph nodes removed last March,(on my daughters 17th birthday). Movement in my arm was quite restricted for some time, but, the excersizes I was given helped me to regain movement, I now have full movement but still some cording, but this could well be because I didn't do the exercizes as much as I should have done or for as long as I should have done. I have been fortunate in that as yet I have not had lymphodema. you just need to take extra care not to get cut. We have several pets and I refuse to feed the ferrets or gerbils to avoid the risk of getting bitten or scratched. If i need to clean the cat litter I use extra care of wearing disposable gloves.  If you have any concerns talk to your breast care and/or surgeon, they should be able to reassure you.  The inconvienience of temporary restricted movement is a small price to pay to know that the cancer has been removed.",

I can only o very little in the house at a time before I need to rest. I guess it is something the cancer itself and the treatment causes.
