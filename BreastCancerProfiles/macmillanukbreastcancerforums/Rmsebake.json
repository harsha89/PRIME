      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm a newbie to your site. I was diagnosed with invasive ductal BC with a tumour of 47mm two weeks ago, I am having my op tomorrow, left breast mastectomy and SNB.  Obviously not very happy but have decided I'm going to try and not  waste my time worrying about it and try to look past it. So, I wanted to ask about reconstruction - what are everyone's thoughts about the different options as I have no idea what to choose. Thank you R",
