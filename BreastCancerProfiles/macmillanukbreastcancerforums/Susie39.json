      "Content": "Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer yesterday. Surgeon and Macmillan nurse were so caring. I have a lumpectomy on 12th June, followed, six weeks later, by fifteen sessions of radiotherapy. Five years of tamoxifen and yearly mammogram. Whilst I am so grateful it\u2019s been diagnosed at an early stage, I am feeling very scared and can\u2019t sleep. Any tips for coping?Â ",
