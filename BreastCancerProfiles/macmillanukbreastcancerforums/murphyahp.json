      "Content": "Hi, I'm so sorry to hear about your problems after reconstruction. I had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in December. I did the exercises and followed all the instructions and thing weren't too bad until about 9 weeks post op. My reconstructed breast got red and sore and before I knew what happened I was rushed back into hospital very ill with cellulitis. I was in hospital for two weeks with this and am now home and hopefully doing ok again but the breast is now an awful looking thing. It's very tight again and my back seems to be getting sorer. I'm doing all the exercises again and pray it will all loosen up a bit but the breast has now gone so badly out of shape it's horrible. The scar, which was halfway down on the lower half is now a very deep sunken valley and where they drained some fluid is also scarred with very deep grooves. It's impossible to even see the scar now never mind check that it's ok. It's very difficult to get a nights sleep as well. To be honest I am very disappointed with the reconstruction and feel these possible problems were not explained to me beforehand. I would still probably have opted for reconstruction but at least I would have been better prepared. I feel guilty for complaining when others are going through much worse but sometimes.... I hope you get some solutions to your problem and get some relief soon Aileen",

      "Content": "Hi Elvy, I'm sorry if my post is causing you to worry but I feel I definitely didn't ask enough questions before my operation but when you hear the word \"Cancer\" the brain goes funny. You are in a different place so make sure the surgeon answers all your questions. If you had your lumpectomy in 2001 and everything is ok surely your reconstruction will be completely different than for someone who has had a full mastectomy . Ask them to explain what is the difference between the reconstruction you will have and what it would be after a full mastectomy? Mine was called an LD reconstrution but I'm sure it must be different in your case. I was checked on a weekly basis for the first month. They were very surprised when I developed the cellulitis so far down the line and said they had never seen it at this stage before. I now know that cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissue and skin and, in my case, they said I must have been carrying some bacteria that was dormont for a long time. Cellulitis can be very serious if not treated promptly as it gets into the bloodstream and can travel to other organs. Will your reconstruction involve any implants? At one stage they thought I my infection might have been caused by the implant being rejected but thankfully it wasn't. Regarding Lymphoedema (swelling of the affected arm), I think this only becomes a really serious issue of the surgeon removes lymph nodes but not too sure so again I'd check with the surgeon. I have good movement in my arm and have some simple daily exercises to do to help with this. I have to be very careful not to put too much pressure on the arm or lift anything heavy etc due to the risk of Lymphoedema but this may not apply to you at all. I know it's very difficult for you to make this decision but everyone is different and for the few who do develop problems there are loads who never do. I truly wish you well and hope it all works out for you. Aileen",
