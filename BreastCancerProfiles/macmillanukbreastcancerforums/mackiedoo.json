      "Content": "The surgeon found a third 'type' of cancer in the errant and removed right boob. I have an MRI coming up to look and see if there are any bothersome places in this aging body. My question is this: The IDC and ILC are both greedy little buggers and aggressive - they didn't find the ILC until the mastectomy. It didn't show on the mammogram either. I'm considering having another mastectomy on the left boob - not now, after chemo has finished and this blimmin pain and soreness has gone from the first one. My boobs have been dense for a long time and don't show any signs of improving - and that could mean that cancer may be missed. For me, I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea as a preventative measure - because the chances of either cancers appearing in the lonesome left boob are fairly strong and I guess, left alone, may well turn out to be a very nasty surprise a bit later on ... Whadya think?",

      "Content": "Hello jacqui I had ILC, IDC and DHIS all in the right boob, but it's the IDC and especially the ILC that worry me - especially as you rightly say, with the incidences of recurrance.  Of course I would rather not have to consider another Mx at all because this one that I had 12 days ago is awfully painful, sore and needs draining every couple of days - they took out the drains last Friday even though one was putting out 80cc still each day....so it's all building up and I'm raw,,,,kind of, especially having to excercise the arm too. I'm glad that you think along the same lines - sorry that you ever had to think about it though. I can't imagine having both removed at the same time, when one is painful enough - I salute you and your strength! It was enlightening and welcoming to know that yours was picked up with an MRI - I am due one, just waiting to find out when, at present.  I had wanted a PET scan as they are brilliant, but although they have a PET machine here in Cork, for the past two years, they do not have an operator!!! SO a very expensive machine is gathering dust and patients are sent to Dublin for their PET scans from literally all over Ireland!   I guess if the mRI is positive for the left boob for any hidden cancers then they will tell me it's what should be done anyway - only I wanted very much to get the chemo over with first - ....but reading your post, I wonder if it's not a bad idea after all to get the other Mx done and delay chemo if no other mets show up that they can see.....difficult situation....not a welcome one really if you know what I mean. Not a good day at all really, today - feeling so nauseous for several days with no appetite eitehr - did you feel the same after your Mx's. Tramadol does nothing but block & bloat my stomach and make me feel worse, so I have limited myself to one capsule of oxynorm a day (10mg) and that I take after 7pm, otherwise if I take the two that they suggest, I cant go to the loo and feel 'out of it' all day and night.....but I think it''s the Oxy that is making me feel sickly......swings and roundabouts eh! I hope your day has been ok - when did you have your Mx's?  Believe me when I say that my heart goes out to you - and I sincerely hope that this is an end to the blasted invader for you xxxx",

      "Content": "Was your cancer ILC or IDC (Invasive lobular cancer or Invasive ductal cancer) or was it perhaps DCIS Nikki? As your decision was not a cosmetic one obviously, your wishes should have been taken into consideration not matter what.  Who out of all of us, wants to think we may have to go through this god-awful thing again - let alone the pain and soreness of the debilitating surgery !! I know that surgeons wll go all out for preservation of the breast - but I also wanted a Mx when we only knew about the IDC, let alone the ILC, as IDC is also common in recurring.....saying that, I'm not brave at all and can't imagine what it must be like to have undergone a double Mx, when this single one is causing me so much grief physically and put me on a real downer at present mentally too. I feel for you Nikki xx",
