    "Content": "I went on holiday 2 weeks after radical mastecomy & found a bikini from Amoena & a swimming cotume from women zone in Warrington. Not cheap I must admit but hadn't time to shop around both about Â£40.00. Unfortunately as we are in a minority things are more expensive. As it is now coming up to winter there may be bargains to take advanage of. Have look at Amoena, Nicola Jane, Women |one & Bouncing Back. good luck. Wiggy x",
