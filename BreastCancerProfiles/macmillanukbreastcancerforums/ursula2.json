      "Content": "    i wonder if they would do your radiotherapy  and then give you longer to think about things .Are you planning immediate reconstruction?     For me   i knew i wanted rid of my breasts  once diagnosed , i knew it wouldnt remove all risks as it can come back in the small amount of tissue left  it lessens the chance and i've got a lot of life to be living   i haven't bothered with reconstruction and couldnt be happier   hated  the period of time when i was lopsided. remember although massive operation  they would not offer it you it  they thought too risky sorry i cant be of any real help in your decision making   i just wanted to say  having a double masectomy isnt the end of the world and it does give me as fellow faulty gene sufferer some sense of control over my body    ",
