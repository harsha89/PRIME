    "Content": "Hi catlover. Your situation sounds similar to mine a bit. I noticed my nipple looking different over xmas, tried to get a walk in appointment to get things started but like you were told, they can\u2019t refer. So I went first thing on the 2/01 to my GP who found a lump and has referred me straight up and my appointment is Tuesday. I\u2019m dreading it but glad everything\u2019s happened so fast. It\u2019s definitely only been there for a short time. I\u2019m also youngish (34), with no family history of BC, a good (extremely healthy) lifestyle and I\u2019ve had cysts before (not in my boobs) so I\u2019m hoping things go in my favour. Nevertheless it\u2019s an extremely worrying time.Â  I really hope things work out ok for you. xx",
