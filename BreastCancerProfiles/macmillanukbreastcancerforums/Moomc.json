They think mine is grade 1, slow growing, 11mm, oestrogen receptive & not in the lymph nodes. I\u2019m not certain but I think as your going straight to radio either you possibly didn\u2019t have it or the results where good. Sending hugs xxx",

I think if it oestrogen + then it is slower growing as well. Fingers crossed I get the same results as you tomorrow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for. Sending hugs xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Frillyflower, Mine was 12mm, just over 1cm and they don\u2019t think it\u2019s spread to my lymph nodes, I had my surgery 10th May, possibly your May be something like me. Surgery to remove the lump & the first lymph nodes just to check them. I had to be at the hospital for 10am & knew by surgery would be in the afternoon, had an ultrasound then an injection of the radioactive stuff, lots of chats with nurses, my surgeon etc. Was in theatre at 3pm & Home by 7.30, a bit sore & groggy but starving  Spent that night & the whole of the next day resting in bed but was pretty much ok after that. Just the wait now for the results & that\u2019s probably harder than the surgery if I\u2019m honest. My family have grown & moved out and my husband works shifts so lots of time on my own to \u2018think\u2019, I try my best to be as busy as possible when I\u2019m on my own, right up until bedtime so hopefully I\u2019m so tired I can get a decent sleep. This is all doeable as this site proves daily, just cry when you need to but don\u2019t let this take anymore away from you than it has to, take back some of the control. Sending hugs xxx",

      "Content": "Morning  Frillyflower & welcome. Your diagnosis sounds very similar to mine, routine mammogram, then recall where they done another mammogram, ultrasound & biopsy, dreaded 2 week wait for results of BC, 1cm ductal & looking like it\u2019s not in my lymph nodes, diagnosed 18th April.  I had my surgery 10th May to remove the lump WLE ( wide local excision) and removal of the 1st lymph nodes SNB( sentinel node biopsy) and just waiting for the results of my surgery and forward plan on 30th May. Your treatment will possibly be something similar to mine, no doubt your mind is working overtime, I know mine did, but I will say so far things have been nowhere near as bad as I imagined, the waiting is possibly the hardest part as you feel out of control. Don\u2019t google ANYTHING, just use the sites stated on here or your mind will explode.

They left to do the thing but then came back in & said I wasn\u2019t lined up properly but it was only the floor one so I was ok but they had to start moving the bed again to get the right place, they also forgot to give me the little screen to watch as I\u2019m left side so I just had to guess with my breathing. the thing is it just stresses you out a little for the next one also as I expected my skin has started blistering & itching so I have 2 dressings on & hydrocortisone cream & antihistamines good luck to everyone today no 8 for me so just over half way through just hoping my skin holds out  sending hugs xxxx",
