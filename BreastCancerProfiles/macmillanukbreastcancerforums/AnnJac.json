Good luck with all your planning and treatment ",

The surgeon would like me to lose half a stone before op if possible.  I have put on loads of weight during chemo - comfort eating and sweet things tasting best.  So just as taste buds are beginning to recover, and Christmas, I need to watch what I eat!  Oh well - choose food carefully and keep portions small. . . . .   I was planning to lose weight after surgery so if I do some now I will be ahead of the game!",

      "Content": "Hi. Just back from my appointment with the breast surgeon. The MRI shows that there has been a good partial response to the chemotherapy. The tumour is still 5cm but instead of being a solid mass it is now like a honeycomb. This is quite a normal response from a tumour that is not too aggressive apparently. But what this means is that i will have to have a full mastectomy and full clearance of all my lymph nodes. I will have a reconstruction at the same time as the surgery. This operation is not done in York but they have made me an appointment for 19th December at Castle Hill, Cottingham to see the surgeon there. Don't know the time yet. It is expected that surgery will happen between 12th and 31st January. There will be a number of tests that I will need prior to surgery to check that tummy fat is all healthy with good blood vessels for use to make a new breast. If i need work on the other breast to balance things up this will be done in York but at a later time. I am going ahead with my final chemotherapy on 12th December. Whether I need radiotherapy will depend on the testing of the diseased tissue. But belt and braces \u2013 probably. Then hormone tablets for 10 years. Not what I was hoping for \u2013 but the new breast will probably look better than one with a lump cut out of it. I will be in hospital for 3-5 days. Full recovery about 12 weeks but should start to feel better after 2 weeks and much better after 6 weeks.",

He is happy with the results of the 5 I have had. And he reminds me that each chemo is harder to deal with than the previous one. But the surgeon wants me to have surgery as close to 4 weeks after the last chemo as possible on the basis that the chemo stays in the body for 3 weeks \u2013 but my cancer is still there and so they want rid of it as soon as possible after chemo has finished. And i am already 2 weeks post chemo and appointment in 2 weeks time to start surgery process would take me to 4 weeks post chemo. Oncologist didn't seem worried about that but would see if he could get me an earlier appointment. But that would only be a week maximum. So if i don't have last chemo then surgery could be 6 \u2013 8 weeks after last chemo rather than 4 \u2013 6 weeks after last chemo. The surgeon says the last chemo may kill some more cells. The oncologist wasn't worried he was happy with what had been killed already. Surgeon gave impression she wants me to have last chemo. Oncologist not bothered. I asked why they targeted 6 chemo. Oncologist said they like to do a minimum of 4 but 6 is traditional! So now i don't know what to do. Have the last chemo or don't have the last chemo?",

I aught to feel euphoric that this part is now over but am quute tearful and overwhelmed.  But I have had a nice day with a visit to my work and seeing my colleagues was so lovely.  And no I must get my body and mind stronger to face surgery and radiitherapy.  So more walking, more outings, more visiting - each day i hope to feel a little better.  And it is a relief to know I havent got to go through all the chemo joys again.

But things aren't always text book.  I am 14 weeks post right mastectomy, DIEP, with full node clearance.   Unfortunately I have had some problems and I am still not healed to the new breast.  Thin skin led to skin necrosis and i have a large open wound under my breast.  Skin grafts to be done in next couple of weeks so I can move onto radiotherapy.  I also have major fatigue issue but am beginning to suspect that Letrozole is contributing to this.  Been on Letrozole for 10 weeks now. I suggest you discuss with surgeon and his team - and you could wait a few weeks and see how quickly you recover. Good luck with op.  Fingers crossed you sail through.  ",

What a blow though when you thought you had it all mapped out!  Cancer is like that and the curve balls catch us by surprise.

I have had neo adjuvant chemo with a partial response but still need a full mastectomy.  So - full mastectomy, DIEP flap reconstruction and breast reduction to good boob - all planned for the one hit operation.  I have some silly questions for you ladies who have done it before me. I have ordered some front fastening post surgery bras in the size suggested by consultant - smaller than I am now.  Did you find front fastening easier to start with? PJs or nightie?  I normally wear PJs and thinking of getting some front fastening ones for easy access to wounds.  And easier to get on? Will I have a catheter when I wake.  If so would nightie be easier? I am having full node clearance so will getting clothes over my head be hard to start with? Sleeping - would a v shaped pillow help in the first few week?  I assume it will be hard to fully lie flat to start with? I'm asking hubby to take some time off when I come out of hospital.  As a general rule will a week be long enough?  He might drive me nutty if more than that! Also ordered some light support briefs. Anything I can do to prepare apart from trying not to panic and to keep walking! I will probably think of loads of other stuff.  MRI Monday, prep op Friday and then ok.   Many thanks in anticipation",

So my advice - see whats normal for you and then just take temperature if you feel someting could be wrong. All the best.",

I didn't make my 5500 steps yesterday - was about 800 short.  Hubby was home and I don't potter about so much when he is home.  But have done it today.  My visitor this morning had to cancel so I went bra shopping (yet again!l this morning and then dragged myself out for my one mile walk this afternoon.  No nice pics today as the walk was very urban around housing estates.  Need to go out early tomorrow as popping in to work for a catch up over lunch and then hospital in afternoon.  Will seem strange when I can't call in at work anymore (I am retiring on 31st May).

      "Content": "No particular walks for the last few days although apart from today, when I visited 92 year old Mum, i have achieved my 6000 steps a day target.   Friday saw an emergency trip to hospital as PICO dressing was being very efficient but was full after a day and a half.  So new one applied and seems to have settled down.  So that day was hospital walking and general pottering. Saturday was quite fun - looking for a hat for the Royal Garden Party.  Didn't find one but was fun trying hats and fascinators on.  Decided I don't like fascinators.  Not many hats in shops (apart from specialist shop when they were £250 a hat).  So ordered one on line from Debenhams (£30).  If it's no good i can take it back.  So retail walking. Took Mum out for lunch today - she lives 80 miles away.  Her car has given up the ghost and she needed to decide whether to get a new one - at 92!.  I think she has decided not but is struggling with some of the independence she will lose.  Taking her to look at mobility scooters in a couple of weeks - that might improve her quality of life as we could put in our car and we could have a trip to the seaside which she hasn't been able to do due to poor mobility and a fierce pride. Lots of lovely walks from you all this weekend - well done.  Lovely to see.  Keeping my target at 6000 for another week at least - don't think I can do any more whilst I have this awful wound issue. Hope you all have a lovely week ahead xx",

Family weekend ahead including my lovely 18 month old grandson.   Hoping for cuddles but he is very lively! Swimming sounds wonderful.  Very jealous xx",

Anyway - got distracted there!  We have decided to do a skin graft next week or the week after.   He needs to look at his list and see where he can squeeze me in.  Local anaesthetic.  So fingers crossed this works.  Then nurse decides that she will put some jelonet with gauze on the wound and my \"snug\" bra will hold it in place.  I did tell her it wasn't that snug as F cup one side and B cup the other . . .   So got home and guess what dressing had slipped; bra stained with blood.  So luckily I have a box of various dressings from the last 13 weeks and i have dressed with the most comfortable dressings I have and ordered some more from gp surgery.  I will do my own thing with wound until I have the graft. Still got no energy, get breathless and legs very heavy.  But lets get healed, then I can start radiotherapy and once that is done I will try and sort out everything else.  I reckon it will be end of May before radiotherapy starts.  Not much walking being done but I have decided not to push myself at the moment.  I will try and get out though for the sake of my mental health.   I could do with a Little Henry moomy! Enjoy the lovely weather everyone.",

Phone rang at 12.15.  It was the hospital to say they had been expecting me at 12 for my skin graft today!  No telephine calls or letters telling me about this!  I am an hour away from hospital but agreed to drop everything, drag husband away from preparing for his golf holiday tomorrow to drive me there and back and got to hospital by 2pm.   So I have had my skin graft done under a local anaesthetic.  Didn't take long - took me to theatre at 4.10 and back at 4.50.  So i now have a huge plaster on my leg and another on my breast.  Back next Tuesday to check boob.  Dressing stays on leg for 2 weeks undisturbed.  No pain at moment, think I may still be numb! Can't drive for a week.  On my own for 3 days from tomorrow.   I was hoping to take myself for treats.  But guess it is binge TV - certainly tomorrow.    Love everyone's pics.  Was planning a Bluebell visit this afternoon - but at least I can see them in your pics.

Met colleagues for lunch yesterday as part of my retirement farewells (I am having a few such sessions). But it did make me very sad.  My management team - so the people i worked so closely with.  But my replacement is doing a good job, differently from how I would do things (but that's fine), and the office didn't fall apart because I haven't been there.  I put it down to my leadership having got things into such a good state!  But I will miss them and it was lovely to see them all together and have a nice social lunch.  And my hair is now longer than most of them.  Mind you two are quite bald, one shaves his and the other two probably still have longer hair than me!  (All men).  But I did feel quite down as I left them.  Normal I suppose.  The end of such an important part of my life.  Work was my job, my hobby, my life challenges - and I did enjoy it so much.  It gave me such a buzz to be involved in exciting projects, to work with such talented people, and to lead a team that achieved fantastic results which were recognised nationally within the industry.   I am meeting up with the colleagues I did a masters degree with (we graduated 2 and a half years ago with me by far the oldest in the group at turned 60 then - i was honoured that work sponsored me at such an old age!) for an evening get together next wednesday.  Alcohol will be involved with these 30 and 40 year olds!  So i have booked a hotel.  Then the following day I am having lunch with my head of service and my management peers.  Then on the 24th is my formal leaving do where there will no doubt be speeches etc!  I have my dear mate Simon lined up to pull funny faces at me so i don't cry!  Then the pub and then a few of us will grab a pizza.  Then that will be it (although retirement day actually 31st May).  It will feel so strange. Sorry - that was a bit of a waffle on about my retirement!  And in the middle of all those events is my trip down to London for the Royal Garden Party!  Hopefully you are all well xx",

My plans for today - waiting for microwave repair man this morning but if he comes early i will walk to local Aldi to pick up salmon and salad.  10 mins walk each way.  Then I have a cake date this afternoon (so not going to have lunch  . . . ).  And walk to Cake D'Licious (lovely name for a tea room) is about 15 minutes each way.  And i will use the upstairs loo rather than the downstairs one (every little helps!). Hope you all enjoy your walks today and when I go somewhere more exciting I will share pictures (in Whitby for new year).",

Anyway following your walks with interest and enjoyment.  Keep voi g and hopefully in 6 weeks I will be walming with you inbetween radiotherapy sessions.",

Healing is still slow.  Saw the plastic surgeon yesterday and he thinks it will heal.  But seeing him again next week to assess progress and make decisions as to whether to go for skin grafts.  He wasn't happy with the dressing regime and I felt it was my fault.  But I had been doing as instructed by the plastic team dressing nurses.  So he told me I needed to get dressings checked at gp practice on Friday and put a different dressing on.  But couldn't give me any spares.  So I made appointment for Friday but woke up this morning with dressing soaked through with blood and leaking.   So phoned gp and got an emergency dressing appointment and saw a lovely nurse.  She cleaned it all up, measured wounds so we can record progress, redressed it.  Wrote me a prescription for spare dressings and arranged to see me in a week so she can give me some more support through this.  And then gave me a hug! Not at my usual practice and in centre of York with no parking but she was so lovely I will go back for continuity.   Have seen 5 different nurses at hospital - and they are lovely too but no continuity.   Sorry - that rambled on.  You only asked how the healing was! But I am persevering with moving and have exceeded my 4000 step target every day.  Hope going back to work is not wearing you out - take it easy. Keep going everyone - we can do it.",

Healing doesn't seem to be improving so I am going braless for a few days to see if that helps.  Not seeing anyone so the quite disturbing body shape and oozings won't matter.  Got appointment on Thursday for pathology results and ongoing treatment plan.  Had heads up that more nodes were cancerous than had been thought - 4 rather than 1.  No idea if that is skmething to worry abiut so I'm trying not to.  Need radiotherpay but healjmg may delay this.

Very emotional at moment.  Rang GP surgery to make an appointment for a face to face consultation re fatigue, leg/foot/ankle that not working, insomnia, etc etc.  Receptionist was very nice but no normal appointments were available with any doctor in the 4 week period they have open for appointments.  And I just burst into tears.  So she has given me an urgent appointment for next Tuesday.  Didn't mean the water works to give me special  treatment.   Think she was worried about me as she said don't forget we are here and if you need to speak to a doctor just ring and She would get one to phone me. Very nice lady.  But I do need a face to face as how do you show how your foot and ankle don't move over the phone! Anyway got a few nice things planned for the next few days - no real walking as I am only to potter.  But will potter to the bus and from bus to cafe to meet some friends timorrow and friday.  Then going to see Mum on Saturday.  Hardwick Inn again for lunch Moomy. Happy hols, walking, exercising, crafting, gardening etc everyone xx",

      "Content": "Hi.  Not sure where to post this up date!  Not really walking related - apart from problems stopping me walking! So. Went to see GP today with a number of issues.  First - foot drop.  GP referred me for an urgent brain scan to rule out problem caused by secondaries in brain.  We both think that all will be clear and most likley cause -  chemo or trauma from operation.   Once brain proves to be clear then she will refer me for specialist physio.  In the meantime I will start some exercises I have found on a reputable source on the net.   Nothing to lose. Second - fatigue.  Thinks this is most likely Letrozole related.   But doing some more blood tests.  If these come back OK then to ring breast care nurse and seek an appointment with consultant.   I told her I couldn't be like this for 10 years.  She also said still early days and foot drop, healing, anxiety, stress can all cause fatigue and that it was early days.   Emotions - all over the place.  But she thinks I am dealing with it normally.  Yes very tearful at the drop of a hat but so much to deal with.  I am doing the right thing in trying to plan things to look forward to every day.  But if the world starts turnjng black then to go back and she would prescribe anti depressants. Hospital tomorrow to check wound . . . .  Hope you all had a lovely bank holiday weekend. Xx",

Tried to make an appointment with GP today.  Haven't seen one since diagnosis in July.   Can't get one before my meds run out.  Oncologist only prescribed 28 days supply and letter to GP only came through on Friday.  Maybe should have made appointment before letter came.  So I have a telephone appointment a week on Wednesday - the earliest they could do.  Never been one to go to doctor and when I have needed help it has been of the I need to see a doctor urgently variety and then got a same day appointment.  Both these times it turned out I had cancer - endometrial and then breast.  So a bit of a shock how difficult it is to get a routine appointment to discuss drugs and ongoing support. Oh well.  The sun is shining and my fit bit says I have done 3000 of my 4000 steps.  May be trickg getting another 1000 in pottering around the house  . . . ..  Have a good week everyone x",

Enjoying your visits, walks, stories - keep it up and I'll join in properly again soon.",

Drove down to York with hubby this afternoon and a short walk along the river to a cafe for a cup of tea.  Made a change from walking round the block.  Total steps today 5600 so far.  Think I will up the target to 6000 next week.  ",

My mobility is stopping me getting out much - particularly on my own.  I am losing confidence.   So i have swallowed my pride and ordered a rollator to help me get about outside.  At least i will be able to sit when i need to and it will take the pressure off my arm.  I need to use a stick in my right arm which is the one where axillary  clearance and so I am concerned about the strain on it.  Start radiotherapy in a couple of weeks and so lymphoedema risk increases.  I do hope they can sort my foot drop out but won't be a quick process I'm sure - haven't even got a physio appointment yet! (MRI showed no brain mets - hooray!). Hubby out at least 4 days a week playing golf and then has household chores and gardening so apart from taking me to see my mum every 2 weeks he doesn't have time to take me out.  Changing my car for an automatic so driving is easier and safer (left leg gammy).  I am trying so hard to look after my mental health by being determined and getting out a bit.   So hope it helps!  I will feel very self conscious.  But i will get out and about.  For goodness sake there is only so much homes under the hammer a woman can take . . . . . Keep the pics coming and I hope to get out more soon (in between radiotherapy!)",

Violetsniff - lovely tk spend time with the little ones.  And so sorry to hear than a family member has cancer.  I am sure you give them comfort. moomy - a domestic day.  I must have one of those.  I have had some cleaning help these past few months but hubby retired a couple of weeks ago and said we didn't need her anymore.  Guess who spends 4 days a week on the golf course?  So i need to do some light cleaning and nag him to do the heavy stuff. Tomorrow brings a visit from my lovely friend Simon and afternoon tea and cake.  Scone?  Fruut cake with cheese? Victoria sponge? Cheesecake?   Hmmmm. Have a good day all",

Then into the palace itself where no pics allowed.  And then out onto the lawns.  Glorious weather and lots of lovely hats and dresses.   Will move to a new post for more pics",

Saw GP on Tuesday and just had a call from her.  She has spoken to my oncologist who thinks my mobility is probably not cancer related but ti have a spine bone scan to rule out spine mets.  And then if this OK then refer me to a neurologist.  We are all agreed that physio shouldn't be done until we know the cause.  I have no pain just immobility and weakness.  Quite typical of onset multiple sclerosis but it would be bloody unlucky if this was the case!  I'm sure it's not.  Just glad doctor is taking it seriously.  It has coincided with taking Letrozole so I am not convinced it is unrelated.  But we have to investigate.  I like a good puzzle and problem solving - but not this way lol. Going out again tomorrow to meet a friend at a food fayre in Helmsley.  Me and Willy Wonka will be good to go. Enjiy the nice weather everyone xx",

How ling does it take to get full movement back and more importantly how ling before it stops hurting.  It hurts less in morning and get worse in the evening - which I suppose could be down to tiredness.
