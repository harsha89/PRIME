      "Content": "That's a good way to think about it Rose2018; I'll use that line myself if you don't mind. I'm just waiting for my first appointment, if the trial I signed up to tells the hospital to treat me with chemo which there is a good chance they will. Good luck with everything and keep up with the positive mindset:) Sash70",

      "Content": "Can't see where to add a post without it being a direct reply to another post on new site, anyway, I am really struggling not knowing which way my treatment plan will go now. I know it was my choice to sign up to OPTIMA trial with a very slim chance this may mean no chemo, but waiting for the news is driving me mad. I was told I would know by today! At least I now have a date for chemo which is 24th, so that's something. Had a wig fitting today which was horrible, and got a haircut booked for Saturday, no idea how short to go yet. Not knowing is awful and it's strange but I kinda want to get on with next phase of treatment now, enough waiting - it means the end is closer too hopefully - hospital said they will hopefully hear by end of today what the verdict is, so waiting now ... nothing is easy about any of this. sash70",

      "Content": "Thank you Leolady56 for your reply and words of understanding and support. It sounds as if you've got great support and that is what really helps us through all this isn't it? I've booked a haircut just in case my treatment plan is chemo first; then if it does fall out it won't be so drastic - hopefully. Your words about listening to your body are so true and it is really worth listening. None of it easy, and am sure more challenges ahead, but we have  a good local support group which has been an invaluable source of support, even just having an impartial ear can be a huge help, thank goodness for these wonderful groups that rely so much on charity. All the best for now Sash",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I had my first oncology appointment last week, following surgery (mastectomy and full auxillary node clearance) in May and have been feeling wobbly ever since because it brought up anxiety about the treatment and its side effects and also thoughts about recurrence I hadn't even begun to think about as they go through different outcomes with you. I signed up to the OPTIMA trial, so there's a small chance my treatment plan may not involve chemo, but having thought this was a done a deal, I am now in limbo awaiting news of what the treatment will involve and although my choice to take part in trial, it's tough not knowing. And it's tough thinking about the effect not only on me, but on my partner and my son who still lives at home. Losing my hair is my biggest hurdle and I know it seems minor in the grand scheme of things, I can't help feeling it's like one ask too many with all this following the surgery. Has anyone out there tried the cold cap? All the best to you all Sash",
