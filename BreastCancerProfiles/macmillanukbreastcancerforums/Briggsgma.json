    "Content": "Hello Susie, I take Letrezole in the mornings with my other meds. I am also on a new chemo drug, Ibrance. I have Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. Hoping that these two drugs work and give me more time. Lots of luck. Side effects for me from Letrezole are mostly body aches and occasional hot flashes. Good luck.",
