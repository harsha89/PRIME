      "Content": "Hi Little boo boo I wondered if you could answer a question for me. When you had the pain in your right breast, was it constant or did it come and go and how often? I only ask as I was at the docs again this week and she seemed quite happy with my pain. It has settled a little and is not present constantly but I just wondering if that makes any difference, or not. Many thanks for reading this. Confused and not sure whether to now put it all behind me and move on .... Banjoman",

      "Content": "Hello there and thank you for your reply. Yes I had mammograms on both breasts and an ultra sound scan on the area of the indentation. The pain/discomfort is pretty random but in the same breast and aching sometimes too. Also niggling pain in the same shoulder blade and having been told many years ago that gallstones was the cause, did wonder if the current breast discomfort could be referred pain? I am so sorry your pain proved positive and hope you are okay now. I wondered, did you get a lump or anything with it or just pain and how if it was just the pain, how did they diagnose it? Many thanks again for writing and I would really appreciate anything you could tell me about your experience as I am so worried they may have missed something. Bassplayer",

      "Content": "Hi there I am Banjoman's wife (the one with the original problem of an indentation which was seen at the clinic and I was given the all clear) which was a few months ago. About 2/3 weeks after that appointment I started getting discomfort in the same breast. I have left it some weeks thinking it may go away but it hasn't so have booked to see my GP. I was reading of another lady who has posted of a similar situation and saw that the replies were all cancer positive. I have read that it is not usual that pain alone could be cancer, but not impossible and wondered if there is anyone on here who has had a similar problem and it did not turn out to be cancer?? And if not, what was causing it??? Also, to the ladies who had breast pain but no lumps etc. and it was cancer, how did they diagnose it?  I ask as I am a bit concerned that maybe something was missed at my last appointment. Many thanks for reading this. Bassplayer",

      "Content": "Hi there, (sorry, I don't know your name!) Thank you so much for contacting us, we really appreciate it. I'm led to believe a core biopsy is the taking of samples of flesh from deeper in the breast tissue for examination as opposed to liquid as in a needle aspiration and we've heard it can be very uncomfortable if extreme care isn't taken.  Although we've read that cancer is statistically unlikely in the greater picture of breast cancer as a whole, given my wife's age and the way her GP reacted and responded to the indentation and her comment \" let's hope you've caught it early\" we're not counting any chickens! We've also yet to hear of anyone that presents with an indentation having a benign tumour but we remain hopeful and after Monday's appointment things will be a little clearer.  How are you getting on with your cancer ? We hope that it's getting it's just deserts and you're bearing up as well as possible. We wish you all the very best and hope for a positive outcome for you. All the best for now. Banjoman ",

Yes, you're right, it's a journey and one day at a time certainly makes lots of sense but it's difficult not to speculate until we have more facts and we can make informed decisions. Heh Ho,  roll on Monday!  I'll keep everyone posted as things progress and thanks again for your help. Bye for now,  Banjoman ",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, As promised here is my update on yesterday's events. We attended the Breast Clinic very early for the appointment as we wanted to secure a parking place and luckily we acquired one right outside the door ! What are the chances of that for hospital parking these days ? Lisa, our first lovely nurse examined the problem and then went to fetch a more experienced nurse as she thought she could feel some hardening. The second nurse, also a lovely Lisa,  remembered my wife from her earlier visit for an infected cyst three months ago which in a way was really comforting. She gave my wife a thorough examination and concluded that she didn't think there was a problem but just to be on the safe side would order a mammogram and a scan. After a short wait the mammogram was done closely followed by the scan with the consultant radiographer who said that both the mammogram and the scan were clear and that the indentation was caused by a milk duct and the fact that my wife had recently lost some weight. Apparently this type of indentation  is a common occurrence in women who have lost weight. We then heard those wonderful words that after two weeks of waiting worrying and trying to second guess every possible scenario we never expected to hear:  \" Everything is fine, you are free to go \"     Everyone we came into contact with at the clinic was caring, comforting, pleasant and professional. We can't praise them highly enough. And go we did, straight to a restaurant by the river and my wife drank some fizz.  So, a happy ending for us this time. We appreciate that we have been very lucky and that someone was looking down on us yesterday. We're amazed that despite the two weeks of endless searching , Googling, questioning and visiting numerous specialist sites, there was no mention anywhere that weight loss could be a factor in the indentation of breast tissue ! Once again, we thank you everyone for all your support following my posting a few days ago when we were at our lowest and darkest point. All the very best to you all wherever you are on your own individual journey and we hope someone will be there looking down on you too. Love to you all xx Terry (the banjoman)  and Chris",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, This is my first post anywhere regarding this and I seriously hope someone can help us. My wife has her initial consultation at our local breast clinic on Monday after being referred by our GP and suffering an agonising  two week wait. She has a two inch long indentation on one of her breasts and despite our best efforts we can find no experiences posted anywhere from people of a similar age to my wife ( 66yrs ) who has had this problem and whether the cause was anything other than cancer or if it was, whether or not it was benign. Please, can anyone help us ? Banjoman",

      "Content": "Dear Sally, Thank you so much for your prompt reply. Hopefully it will turn out to be nothing more than a cyst and although we had considered this you're the first person to have flagged up this possibility in this situation despite some relentless Googling! Ironically my wife was at the breast clinic only three months ago having again been urgently referred with what turned out to be an aggressive cyst in her other breast which eventually cleared up after a long course of antibiotics. Thanks for the treatment warnings, I think the possibility of a core biopsy is the one holding most dread. How did your lump pan out, are you in the same age bracket as my wife? Kind regards  Banjoman",

      "Content": "Dear Sally, Thank you again for such a prompt response.  You're right, cancer isn't selective and it's something that could hit any of us in some way regardless of our age or lifestyle. It certainly sounds like you've been through the wringer and all credit to you for continuing to work through it all and with such positivity. At the moment here it's the waiting for the appointment and the 'not knowing' that's difficult and although we know everyone goes through it, it gets worse by the day and so it's so good to know that there are folk out there, just like you, willing to give up their time to try and reassure and help us newcomers to this awful scenario make a bit of sense of it all. Thank you so much and may you please continue to keep strong and positive in your battle with this evil disease. All the best for now, we'll know more next week. Banjoman ",
