      "Content": "Hi Staffylove, I too could not inject myself and I am a nurse. When asked on the unit was I happy to do this I thought I could..... roll forward to the Friday evening of the first injection and me and my OH needed up back on the chemo unit as I couldn't do the injection and the oH was a bit worried about doing it. We got shown well he did and then bless him he has done it every time since.... I absolutely hate injections, so please don't feel too bad about the nurses coming out to you as that would of been my next option. its soon all done and dusted.... good luck.  Tess58",

      "Content": "LeoLady, What a brilliant idea. especially with Spring around the corner to get us motivated if we can. If not on those 'grotto bag days ' we can look at the pics and think perhaps tomorrow or next week. Here is a picture of my walk last week in between the rain.  Poppy and Douglas happy to rest with me whilst OH is off taking pics of some wildlife. Got home and did nothing though. 3 miles and I was pooped.  Moys",

I was diagnosed in September and am due to start Chemo next week. At times I thought I need to start right now but 'they' work it all out and design drugs and a programme specifically for your 'bad lump' in order to be rid off.... try and enjoy your holiday, and all will be there on your return... there is a light at the end of the tunnel , just hold on tight . xx",

So I thought I would give them a try!! So I'm thinking of trying both!! You have to keep your sense of humour with all this malarky. Its good (?!) to hear that other ladies have similar problems, you begin to think its 'just you'.",
