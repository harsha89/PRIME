      "Content": "Hi there I too am finding buying a bra for large boobs nearly impossible! I have had lumpectomy and sentinel nodes removed November 16.My size was before op 38gg,I couldn't get any sort of cami top or soft bra to fit other than the sports bra I already had. It is a shock absorber full support with standard bra fitting at the back and another further up. I couldn't fasten top one after op but can now.HOwever I then had to have right side mastectomy in the December as tumour was 10cm. All the mastectomy bras I could find didn't have 38gg size! I bought a Freya black under wired sport bra,was actually in the sale.WAs going to take out the underwire on my flat side but it was very comfy and gave me support under the arm etc.I go for my prosthetic fitting on Monday and start radiotherapy 15sessions on Valentine's Day and still on the hunt for proper bras.GOod luck in your quest and I will keep reading for advice too.THe softer can be pinned in but my new one will probably fall out!hey ho lol you got to laugh  big hugs Marie x",

My left boob is 38Gg my right is now a pancake as I've had a lumpectomy,sentinel nodes removed and then a mastectomy.she has had to order my fake boob as she didn't have any big enough and gave me a catalogue and online info for my size. There was ONE bra only in my size,it was ugly and 48 pounds!! I am not entitled to any benefits at all as even though I've worked for years part time, I was under the threshold for tax and insurance.My husband works but we aren't on mega money,I get free prescriptions but not teeth,opticians etc .If anyone has 38GG I would buy them off you.Also when I look at photos or bras swimming costumes etc. They are all small busted ladies.I can't have reconstruction for a year after radiotherapy and look ridiculous without a bra on.I am thankful to be alive but get fed up sometimes with clothing etc. Thanks for reading love Marie x",

Yes I have bought bras from bravissimo before in the past.They are good, but expensive.I shall try them though.I have found it more comfortable to use my shock absorber sport bras(from Zumba class lol) and I have bought a Freya active which was reasonable price.I will try and make a pocket in them myself.Another lady on here suggested modifying my pre surgery bras by taking out the underwire on my flat side which looks like a good option.

Worth a look.  If you weren't aware,  Macmillan do offer grants to people who need them, if you ring the helpline on 0808 808 0000  open Monday to Friday from 9 am to 8 pm,  they will give you more information.  hi thankyou for the advice,I have been looking everywhere for days now.The best option size wise and cost is to buy the pockets to sew in myself.I will let you know how I get on. Thankyou for advice re. The grant I have filled in paperwork and it is being processed. I received my prosthesis yesterday and she's massive! Size 38gg (11.15x14) I wore it and was comfy but started to move out of my bra so I will sew the pockets in when they arrive. It came with a booklet of bras etc to buy and they only had one that fitted for 48 pounds, I've looked at many shops and stores but most go up to dad it's virtually impossible to get 38 gig Thankyou all from Marie xx",

I did have all the breast tissue removed on the right side so flat as a pancake on one side and still a whopper on the other lol.so don't despair,I am on tamoxifen and its 3 weeks since I had 15 sessions of radiotherapy.I think if my score was higher and I was advised to have the chemo I would.Good luck to you and hope my story helps xx",
