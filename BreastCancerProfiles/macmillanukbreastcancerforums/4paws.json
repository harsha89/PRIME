      "Content": "Hi, I didn't have the cold cap as I was told that because I suffer with migraines, it could bring them on, so I decided against it. I started loosing my hair about 10 days after the first Chemo, and it was very upsetting, people told me that I would feel better if I got it shaved off, but it was weeks before I could bring myself to make that decision, but I now feel loads better now it has gone. I've got lots of hats, and a wig, but I mostly just wear hats. I met a lady at the hospital who had the cold cap, and she started loosing her hair about the same time as me, and she also had it shaved off and felt loads better. I live alone with my dog, and when I was first diagnosed all I could think about was how I was going to cope, and some sessions have been really tough, with tiredness and just feeling crappy most of the time, there has been moments when I've considered stopping the treatment because of how bad it's made me, but this week is my last Chemo session, and I can't believe it's finally here, after being diagnosed last November and having a Mastectomy.  I've still got three weeks of Radiotherapy to have, and then Herceptin injections at home for the next year, but I think the worse part is nearly over. I've been lucky that I work from home, and have managed to keep working all the way through, some bad days work takes a little bit longer, but it takes my my off things, and also having my dog , who relies on me, that's my reason for fighting this and getting through it all, you certainly find out who your friends are, and it gives you a whole new perspective on life, so just take each day as it comes and you'll be at the end before you know it.

      "Content": "Yes I did have it through a cannula, first time on top on hand, second time was more at the side of my wrist. Can they give you the Chemo drugs on the same side as the Mastectomy ?. I am most tender on middle of forearm, but also top of arm near shoulder. My temperature is ok, and I otherwise feel fairly normal, (or as normal as Chemo let's you be !). It's my last FEC next Thursday, then the next is T plus Herceptin, I'm quite worried about T and herceptin, is it worse than the FEC ? Regards 4Paws",

I am due to see Encologist next Tuesday, and I will mention it then, but just wanted to know if its common. 4 Paws",

      "Content": "After many different responses on whether the vaccine is \"Live\" or not, finally I have an answer which is yes the vaccines are live, the drug company who produces the vaccine sent my vet a data sheet which states that is is a live vaccine, so I need to ask at the hospital again on what are the possible risks of getting the dog vaccinated while I am on chemo. My Encologist advised to wait till chemo was over, and said that I should be very careful of coming into contact with any animal whilst my chemo was taking place. My vet told me that the vaccine was at its most active for two weeks after it was given. I also work with Koi Carp and the majority of Koi that our company imports from Israel and vaccinated against a Herpes virus, so I'm guessing I need to be very careful on coming into contact with these as well. I'm hoping my Encologist was just being super careful, but I will be investigating more on the possible risks, and will post an update when I know anything else.",

      "Content": "Hi, went to see my Encologist for the first time yesterday and he told me that if my dog needs her booster vaccination and it is a \"Live \" vaccine , then I can't have it done while I am going through chemo. I contacted my vet yesterday, and they said that it isn't a live vaccine, but then today a friend of mine has asked the same question of her vet, and has been told that it is a live vaccine. So I don't know what I should do now. My chemo is due to start probably end of the month, and run for 6 sessions, and my dog should have her booster due in April. Any advise you can give would be appreciated",

      "Content": "Hi, last week I had my first Docetaxel and Herceptin, I have been fairly lucky up to now, and not had anything too serious from the FEC drugs, but this week has been awful, I can hardy manage to eat or drink anything, as I have really bad taste in my mouth, which never goes away, I've felt sick all week, but was told by the hospital that they didn't need to give me any anti sickness tablets  because I shouldn't feel sick on these drugs, (well I do), I've had really bad stabbing pains in my back, and my toes are painful, and because of really bad joint pain it's been hard to walk, my temperature has also been a lot higher this week. Is this normal on these sets of drugs?, which drug is doing this,? really can't take much more of this, I can't get an earlier appointment with Oncologist to discuss this, so hoping someone can give some advise. Is there any other drugs they can change me to, which aren't this bad ? Any advise on good things to drink which won't taste awful ? Regards 4paws",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, thanks for replying, I live on my own, so I have moments of thinking \"yes I can do this\", then the tears come and I'm scared. Last Friday when I was told, they were going through some stuff with me, but it's hard to take in, when they said what questions do you have, all I thought was, I have a dog, how long will she need to be in kennels for, and will I manage to walk her. I have some lovely friends and neighbours and they are all being really supportive, but I have always been a very private and  independant person, and I want to be able to still do things myself and not have to ask for help, unless it was absolutely necessary.  Another scary thing for me is that I am self employed, and now worrying on how I am going to manage if I can't work for a while. It's going to be good now I've found this place that I will have someone to talk to who really understands what I'm going through. What stage are you at with everything? Regards 4paws",

      "Content": "Like you I only found out a month ago that there was something that felt different in my right breast, since then everything seems to have moved very quickly, and I had a Mastectomy on Wednesday afternoon. I live on my own so I was kept in hospital overnight. Most of the time I am ok, but then something random will set me off, and I'm in floods of tears. I've spent hours on my ipad reading countless posts about every aspect of the forthcoming treatment. I've been told that after Xmas I'll start Chemo, then Radiotherapy, then hormone tablets. At the moment I am focusing on getting the drain removed hopefully tomorrow, and then being able to get my dog back from the kennel on Monday.  Friends have been really supportive, even though sometimes it feels like some of them pity you, but it's happened, I can't change things and I'll fight it all the way, so hang in there, just being able to read posts on this site and get some lovely replies back has really helped me.
