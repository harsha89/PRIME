I am a mental health nurse but I fell into the same dark place as you and couldn\u2019t find anything in my \u2018toolkit\u2018 to help with a diagnosis of breast cancer! Despite support from friends and family I am still struggling. I am also having Herceptin injections every 3 weeks and radiotherapy begins on 6th Dec. I have recently started Tamoxifen and I have noticed my mood is dropping further so making an appointment with my GP to discuss counselling and possibly antidepressants if necessary. I have found that posting on here helps as someone usually comes along with good advice or a virtual hug, particularly on the AWAKE thread which has got me through a few sleepless nights !!  Hugs to you (and Optimistic as I know you are in the same boat xx),  Love Shey xxx",

The planning session is basically a measuring and photographing session to put it basically, which sets the baseline for treatment- nothing to worry about.

After my diagnosis earlier this year she was really worried, especially when she was finally sent for the ultrasound after the mammogram. She also had a lot of pain similar to yours however she was given the all clear and the Dr is writing to her GP to give her opinion of the probable cause - she is seeing GP this week. I was led to believe that the ultrasound is more accurate than the mammogram but I am not 100% sure maybe someone will clarify this. Have they done a biopsy? My sister had one taken at the ultrasound which showed no abnormalities. Fingers crossed it will be the same for you.  This site is really supportive whatever the outcome and especially as it\u2019s sometimes difficult to share your worries with family.  Fingers crossed for you, Love Shey xx",

I also get pains in my arms, hands and shoulders but worse in my elbow area mainly as you say when I first wake up or from sitting. However, I was already going through the menopause and experiencing joint pains. The muscle pain in my legs is a new symptom though! Hi Karen (Toxophilite) - I agree with you about the lack of Oestrogen, my mum had HRT treatment for a long time but really struggled to come off it in her late 60s and ended up going through the menopause again  in her early 70s. Her main problem was joint pain. I\u2019ve decided to give acupuncture a try as the pharmacist at my MacMillan centre says she has had good reports about it from other ladies regarding hot flushes and pain relief for menopause.  Hi Winney,  I had a WLE but after Rads I developed pains in my back which would shoot around under my arm.The radiographer said it was due to the treatment aggrivating nerves where the surgery had been. She said it would gradually improve and it is doing six weeks later.  A mastectomy is a bigger op so I expect it will take longer but I think your BC nurse is a good person to discuss this with. Anyway - roll on July folks  - we can have a virtual celebration when the Herceptin finishes .   Love Shey ",

I get a lot of muscle pain in my legs but put this down to the number of injections I am having - just about to have number 10. I think this is bound to have some effect. I believe the Herceptin is also causing my very dry, sore, crusty (sorry) nose which bleeds easily but my onc doesn\u2019t seem to agree. I didn\u2019t have it before treatment though - I was told this was down to chemo but it has never improved and it finished over 4 months ago.

      "Content": "Hi Emma,  I share your pain! Started Tamoxifen in January and yes I sweat ALL night. Wake up wet through several times a night and now I dread going to bed! Also have flushes right through the day too! My GP prescribed a drug called Clonidine but they don\u2019t seem to be working for me although I\u2019ve seen other people say they\u2019ve had good results. Seeing my Onc on 20th of this month and gonna ask for something else.  Love Shey x",

      "Content": "I have been on Tamoxifen now for 5 days. I take them at night - yes they make me feel a bit sick and got mild joint pain. This does not bother me as I have struggled with Fibromyalgia in the past which at one point was severe however at the beginning of the year all my symptoms seemed to disappear- then in May I got breast cancer !!! Anyway, biggest problem is night sweats - or should I say SWEAT, before it was night sweats due to menopause but now just one long drip since day one! Does this get better or should I discuss with someone and if so who with ??  Thank you,  Shey xx",

To summarise, I gave the cat 'cat litter' for breakfast instead of biscuits - don't report me she didn't eat it but it took me 2 hours to realise, I tried to wash the pots with my oven gloves then attemted to put the TV on using my log fire remote control and ended up shouting my son to sort it when it wouldn't work !!! What's happening to me ???? (Lol).  Love Shey xxxx",

I have been given same treatment regime but I opted for a lumpectomy with follow up radiotherapy. I have had first chemo and Herceptin, will also receive 5 years of Anastrazole. I don't think the treatment would be any different in private care from my own research using NICE guidelines. Good luck with your treatment, I'm back for second lot on Thursday.",

      "Content": "Hi Karen (mum and Mia) just want to reassure you, I 'confronted' my oncologist with the query about NICE recommendations on starting chemo within 31 days after surgery and he just shrugged it off by saying that in my case chemo can commence up to 3 months. We are very similar in diagnosis - my op was on 21/06 and chemo on 03/08. My onc is very good - he is a top  chap at my hospital which specialises in cancer treatment only and very active in clinical trials and lecturing so I do trust what he says. Hope this helps, keep in touch. I'm a bit ahead of you so can share my experience. A lady sat next to me at my first chemo was really helpful to me as she'd had 2 sessions and on same drug regime.  Sending hugs xx",
