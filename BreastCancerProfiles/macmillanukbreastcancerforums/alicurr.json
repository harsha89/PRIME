      "Content": "Hi. I had a bilateral mastectomy in August but was told to wait 6 months before considering reconstruction. I am now disappointed to learn that implants are not suitable for me because I am too thin. Apparently the outline would show not to mention any creasing or rippling. My only option now is the TUG method - taking fat and muscle from the inner thigh. Has anyone any experiences to share of this procedure? I had been so looking forward to my new boobs but now I'm not sure if it will all be worth it as I am actually managing quite well with just my softies and padded bras. I am 49 and miss my boobs but don't want to go through a major operation and lengthy recovery unless the results are really good. I would be grateful for any comments, thank you.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your sympathetic replies. This actually was the second opinion - my breast surgeon had doubts about the implant procedure and so I was lucky enough to be referred to a plastic surgeon in East Grinstead. Fantastic to hear from you, Redkite. It really helped to read your positive and encouraging comments. I wish you well with your recovery. I have a lot of thinking to do and keep alternating between thinking its not worth the ordeal to what a good outcome I could have in the end. Just as I thought I was nearly at the end of my journey it seems I've got such a long way to go. But as it is an 8 month waiting list I have plenty of time to think.. Thanks again for your support. x Â ",
