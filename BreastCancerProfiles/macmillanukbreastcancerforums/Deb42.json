I am also being put on tamoxifen for 5 years. Just looking for some advice on when the best time to take it and what's other peoples experience of it as well. Thanks for any help.

Today I have been experiencing a numb feeling under my arm , not really painful just numb, is this normal. I did have nodes biopsy with the blues dye as well but was told that from my ultra sound that they don't think there is anything under my arm, get all my results on the 28 th, as we all know the waiting is torture. Any advise on the numb feeling, thanks. Debbie",

      "Content": "hello tabitha, I was diagnosed with a 8mm lump on the 13th of December and was told there that it was cancer before I even had my biopsy done, it was incredibly shocking and the first few days felt like I had been hit by a bus. I also went to the doc who gave me some tablets to help with the anxiety and they did make me calmer. I had a lumpectomy on the 15 th of January and all went well. The nurses and doctors are very understanding and will do there very best to help you. I go back on the 28th of January to find out what happens next which I think will be my radiotherapy and possibly hormone tablets. I am only 42 as well and as the time goes on and you understand what is happening to you it gets easier. Good luck with everything. Big hugs Debbie. X",
