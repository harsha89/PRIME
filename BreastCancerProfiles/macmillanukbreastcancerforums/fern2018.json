      "Content": "HI everyone  I have just finished chemo, awaiting radiotherapy.  Thought I would share my fasting experiences. Although I have been more tired than usual chemo has been very survivable with fasting. During the three week cycles I fasted 48 hours before and 24 hours after, during the weekly cycles 24 hours before and 24 hours after. Started in september and carried on all the way through. I have had NO ulcers, no sore mouth, no diarrhoea, been able to eat and drink well when not fasting, have been able to be out and about most days ( including the day after chemo), and had no \"chemo fog\" . Christmas was more tiring than usual but still able to participate in all the social activities and ate well. White count did decrease though never meant I could not have chemo. It recovered well after 2 weeks.   I have been reading alot about low carb for cancer and reduced all sugar and carbs when I am actually eating ( not to zero I love dark chocolate for example) , I have lost a little eight gradually and without strain. Mostly do not feel hungry during fast as I am now used to it.  I will be really interested to know the outcome of the USA trial into fasting which is due to report next year...but I could not wait that long!  I hope everyone who is on this site does well with their treatment; hugs and best wishes to you all.",

      "Content": "HI  I have just started chemo for breast cancer ( I apparently have two types at once) ..after reading various things on the internet I decided to try fasting before chemo to see if that reduces side effects as in some case reports in the scientific literature.  I had drinks only, mostly herb tea and water for 48 hours pre chemo  and on the day of chemo just had some yoghurt and fruit in the evening after.  I was tired after, some heartburn,felt fluey...BUT no vomiting or sore mouth,able to walk everyday and go out to do activities and see friends etc.So enough for me to feel I would do it again... Has anyone else had any experience of this to draw on? I am on three weekly cycle at present so its easy to do. Anyone have any experience of fasting when on weekly chemo?How do you do that? best wishes to all who are undergoing this strenuous form of  treatment...we shall pass through it together.",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for this,interesting to just reduce the fatty foods.  I was surprised how easy fasting was as long as I kept out of the kitchen and let my husband deal with the food. Although I was tired after the chemo and felt a bit groggy alot of that seemed like the side effects of the drugs to stop me vomiting.Was not sick at all and able to eat pretty normally after the chemo which was good. Also well enough to take a walk everyday, no sore mouth.So far no hair loss but that could be because of cold capping and in any case I expect that will get worse with time anyway.  Interesting i n the second week I developed a painful boil ( presumably because my immune system not perfect)but with oral antibiotics it all cleared up completely in a couple of days...so I am saying thank you to my white cells as they must have done their job pretty effectively! Thanks for the encouragement...we must all plod on through. Hugs and best wishes to you and all going through this.",

      "Content": "HI calador, We are handling alot when we deal with facing cancer....Thanks for the encouragement that the radiotherapy night not be too bad! Well done now you are on the other side and thinking about how to lead your precious life to the full. I do not believe we are defined by our cancers.(which may or may not be the death of us)..but by the way we live and what we live for. of course our doctors and nurses are working so hard to do what they do and help as much as they can.However, to be truthful, detailed attention to diet is not in their brief. Why be mad for yourself because you participated in the funeral of a special friend fully and the way that makes sense to you? I got mixed messages about alcohol too, so made my own mind up....have had hardly any but celebrated some special occasions ( christmas and a birthday) with a glass or two, and joy, companionship of friends and without any guilt. Everything we do , every day, brings us closer to the end of life, we just do not know when ! So each day is to treasure with what it can bring for joy and connection. If you can take control of things, that is bound to make you feel better and even change how your body works for the better, I found this book helpful ( It talks about diet and lots of other things we can do to help ourselves) ANTI CANCER a new way of life by David Servan-Schreiber. Also there seems to be quite alot around about how low sugar/intermittent fasting and lowish carbohydrates is good for cancer. I do not do the extreme ketogenic stuff...I like my food and also its too difficult to fit in with other things in my life...but there is interesting  information in a book called Keto for Cancer and another one called The Alzheimers Antidote...both explain a bit about why sugar is so bad for us...but its also really nice sometimes, so I have a square of dark chocolate and enjoy it!. The fact is, as a whole we are living longer than ever before, with better treatments if we do get ill, yet we worry about our health all the time. Find the way to live that works for you and gives you the most happiness....that will be the healthiest life for you too I am sure. Love to everyone getting through their cancer treatment...I met a lady who told me she 14 years on from finishing chemo the other day..living her life to the full too. Calador I wish you all the best.",
