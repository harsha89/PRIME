      "Content": "Thank you for replying to me, it means a lot. I think I feel more alone because my 3 sister's exclude me from everything, they are so in sync with each other, they even kept this news from me and my brother. I found out they were telling others in the family and then other tests etc mum has had to have they 'forget' to tell me. I have not been included by them at all, I found out about everything from other people. This is a time we should pull together, and I don't hesitate to contact them immediately if a member of the hospital contacts me. I told my brother, I did not want him to feel like he was being treated like a child, he has the right to be told- yet I was made to feel like it wasn't my place. He lives about 5 hours away, I get he will feel useless because I do too, but he is a grown man and keeping it from him didn't feel right! Minor things like paperwork need doing and my old sister decided to tell the Social worker that it's between her and 1 of my other sister's. Yet none of us have power of attorney, so any of us could do it, as mum has 5 children not 2. At every turn, I feel excluded.",

      "Content": "Hello Sue, Thank you for replying to me! I am trying to pull together with them, which is why I contact them if the hospital contact me. I am able to visit my mum and I have been doing so, but every time I do I find out I have been left out of something else. Mum is unfit for surgery and Chemo/radiotherapy, and we were meant to go and find a care home together but my sister's have visited already and the manager came to see mum today. I thought it was going to be an initial assessment but it turns out that my mum has already been given a room. I know the care home is for the best, but they are acting like it's all about them. I made a decision, I can choose my family, I will visit mum and make sure the care home workers keep me informed, but I will not rely on them anymore. I feel like I am making myself ill worrying about them and everything they know and just can not be bothered to include me in, as she is my mum too.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your advise, it is much appreciated. I do realise that it should unite us, and I am trying not to take things to heart, but their actions make it so much harder. They manage to talk amongst themselves, but I have to find out things from Social worker/hospital staff etc. I was out and about today visiting mum's care home, I made videos for her, in hopes she would feel less anxious about the move. Whilst I was out, i switched on my mobile data to get about 20 messages between my 3 sister's talking about mum in a WhatsApp group chat, when the move should happen and them making a plan etc. I had spoken to the manager at the care home and wanted to relay what she had said, I did this immediately so it was fresh in my mind. But suddenly one of my sister's switched how it was to much and couldn't we talk about it another time, it was too much. I do take it personally, because it's too much for me to, and all their messages between each other didn't seem to much to bare, until I needed to speak. I have input, give advise, try to help, but it's like I am not even speaking because they talk amongst themselves and reply to each other, but what I say gets no reply, this can be whether they are already talking or if I start a conversation. I am the 2nd eldest of 4 girls, and I also have a brother who is younger, he is mum's 3rd born. I am really grateful for what they do for mum, but I struggle to unite with them because they just don't tell me anything, I could miss out on mum's scans/tests and other appointments if I hadn't made it clear to the hospital and social workers they leave me out, so I just don't have any respect for them. I get we are all stressed and hurting, it's a very hard time, but they consider each other, I always consider them so i should be informed about everything. If they can do things together- keeping each other in the loop, I should get the same courtesy, we are all mum's children. It's not just this, they do things together all the time and don't include me or my daughter, even something like going to the beach. I found out they are all off to Butlins for the weekend, and we got no invite. So I have started doing my own thing, just doing what I can for mum by myself and making sure others keep me updated. They all think it's ok they didn't tell me about mum's cancer, they all excuse their own behaviour, and they are not the only ones going through this and they act like they are. I just want to feel like they are their for me, as know matter what I am here for them, even when voice notes get ignored by them- from my daughter. I only ever hear from them when they want something, which is why I am struggling with my emotions for mum's health and towards them.",
