      "Content": "Morning liz  You can still dye your hair while having chemo ,I did for the whole 6 months of chemo , I had surgery 1st ,mastectomy &. Reconstruction on same day ,may last year ,then had chemo from July till December,  then had lymph node surgery,I\u2019ve just finished radiotherapy,still got my hair ,   You will loose some hair even though your using the cold cap ,,I lost some of the length , But stick with the cap it is really cold ,but for me it stopped the hot flushes  Take snacks ,magazines ,etc or even a friend with you for the 1st time . Good luck .. Sending a hug ,you will get through it ,if you start to have patches they can put gauze on your scalp it helped .  .keep going with the cold cap,even if you feel like giving up ,once you stop they won\u2019t restart cold cap. They suggest simple shampoo too. This site has been great for me as we all experience different things .",
