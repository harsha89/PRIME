      "Content": "Taxotere can cause extreme bone pain. Make sure your Mum checks her temperature to be sure this low period is not an underlying infection. If temp OK then I know it is really hard but you must try to keep mobile otherwise the stiffness can really take over. Your Mum may need to try stronger pain relief for a short period of time. The chemo nurses or onc should be able to arrange this. Is does get easier, although I think it is just your body learning to cope better. The fatigue will probably last after the last chemo. I still get really tired & my last chemo was 1 Sept 2011. I have however returned to work so probably a combination of both. This might sound mad but when I couldn't exercise I used to put on the radio for 5 mins & just have a little dance around the house, anything to keep me moving. Best Of Luck. Jayne",

      "Content": "There is a manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) massage that helps. I found a local therapist who had experience in this technique & got my surgeon & onc to agree it was OK to have. (cannot get this on NHS I am afraid) It was working great whilst having chemo but I had to stop during RADS & the build up around my armpit & chest wall is back but also hardened due to RADS. Can't wait till I can have this again. Was also told not to have it drained as your body relies on the intervention & never finds alternative channels to disperse of the build up. Exercise also helps especially if you gently swing your arms whilst walking. Also try squeezing a stress ball with your arm slighty raised. Best of luck - it has been 8 months since my first surgery & still suffering but it is improving daily. Jxxx",

      "Content": "I believe the other posts have covered all main essentials.   However, someone I met whilst undergoing chemo was visited by a friend following each treatment & given bulbs/seeds to plant. I also had a \"chemo moment\" & went out following one treatment & brought a \"tree\" for my garden to signify my recovery.  I am not sure if you have a garden or if your Mum even likes plants but personally thought the idea of survival/growth a nice one. It also gives you a focal point to discuss when you may not have been up to much else due to fatigue. You presence & support will be the greatest gift of all.  I wish you both the best throughout your journey.  Jayne",

      "Content": "I am also struggling now treatments are over & despite telling my boss I was intending on a phased return to work find that although the hours are reduced they put the same amount of pressure on me as before. I am still not physically over the chemo & rads but wanted to return to work to try to get some normality back into my life. I actually worked part time whilst having my rads (ended 12th Oct 2011) so I think they believe I should be increasing my hours by now. I had two lots of surgery before the treatments so had been off work since Feb 22 2011. Because I don't look ill (thanks steriods) & they have got used to me with no hair & minging nails I think they expect me to be functioning on full cylinders. I think that once you step back into the workplace then it is hard to actually take time off if it is more than you can cope with. I wish I hadn't have been so overkeen. Best of Luck whatever you decide. Jayne",

      "Content": "Thanks - I will persevere with the massage & excercises.  Of all the surgery & treatment this cording has been the most distressing side effect (of yet, only into one cycle of FEC-T) & yet seems to be the one thing that I have not had good support with. All medical staff seem to have a \"it might right itself in time\" attitude & no sign of a physio appointment.  There are various online solutions but  I am very reluctant to attempt these without medical backing.   USA seems to have alot of therapists & techniques to deal with this but with the  UK definately lacking behind.",

I also now have a picc line in the right side for chemo.  I try gentle exercise & stretching but not sure if I should be doing more to \"help myself\".  Do I push myself through this \"take it easy\" as I kepp being told.  Confused!!",

      "Content": "I had bi lateral breast cancer with node surgery to both arms.  My Oncologist did agree to a PICC line being used on the less affected arm (Full auxilary clearance to left but only a couple of nodes to the right).  I have now had 3 x FEC & no problems with the line apart from once again being unable to soak in a bath or have a decent shower (line must remain dry at all times).   My oncologist & chemo team checked the veins by ultrasound beforehand to see if they would be suitable & after three atttempts finally got the line positioned.  I personally would try to avoid lymphodema at all costs & go for the line. The alternative may be a portacath which will mean surgery to implant.  ",

      "Content": "I am sure the cancer did not spread in a week. Perhaps it was just a week apart that she was told the cancer was in both breasts. I am also bi lateral & following the initial mamogramms & ultrasounds was told that only my left breast was affected. However because there had been lymph node involvement was sent for an MRI. It was then they discovered I also had Cancer of the right breast. I think your friend might also be confusing Hormone therapy treatment with HRT. Six sessions of chemo sounds right as they are probably on a three weekly cycle. She is obviously struggling to understand what her medical team are telling her, & this can be common, perhaps she should re speak to them & ask them to jot down what they are discussing, or take someone along to future appointments. Again no medical team would admit to being able to cure cancer, as I am sure you will know. Perhaps your friend will soon feel confident enough to join the MAC community.Good Luck to you both. Jxxx",

      "Content": "I was advised not to have any deep tissue massage, I couldn't have laid on my front for a full massage anyway.  I have been having manual lymph drainage massage following lymph node clearance which has helped greatly. You do not mention what follow up treatment you are had which might influence the therapists decision.  Some people may be uncomfortable with treating people with post operative scars etc & I expect this is more the case. Try to find a holistic massuer rather then the beautician type that seem to be based in most health clubs. ",

I had three sessions of physio in Aug (but only because the hosp needed me to get my arms in the correct position for RADS) these helped but as soon as full range of motion was reached I was discharged. The only thing to assist is to continue the exercises. I was told if you get to a point when it start to feels tight just hold it for a few seconds & gradually the tension will begin to release. I am alot better than earlier in the year but I have been told that the nerve damage may never fully recover. Your BCN should be able to assist shoudl the current exercises no longeer be adequate.
