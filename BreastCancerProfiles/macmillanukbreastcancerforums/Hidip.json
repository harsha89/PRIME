    "Content": "Hi Crystaljuju, Just been reading your post re your lumpectomy and node clearance, I am also awaiting surgery, and have posted before, on Letrozole for 6months to reduce size 3.3cm (had reduced by a third after 3 months) next appointment in November.   I am more anxious regarding auxiliary node removal, drains, than the lumpectomy, so your post was reassuring.  You say you did develop lymphoedema, and that's my worry.  You also say the surgery will take no time at all. How did you feel after surgery?  I have been reading lots of the posts on here and there are some remarkable people on here.  I suppose for me it's the fear of the Unknown, follow up results, treatments etc.  I am 66yrs old and have been diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer with two lymph nodes involved.  I think all the ladies (and men) on here are great in reassuring others.  I have great family support, but hearing from someone who is going through this is  so helpful.  Thanks ........",
