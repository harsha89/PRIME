    "Content": "Hi  I was diagnosed with invasive triple negative breast cancer last March.   I also have Dermatomyositis ( DM) which I was diagnosed in 2016 , this is a rare skin muscle and tissue disease and specialist think this has been the trigger of my cancer !  I have had chemotherapy, two surgery\u2019s and radiotherapy so far and oncology now want to give me a further 8 cycles of capecitabine twice daily.  My first day is today and feeling a bit apprehensive about possible side effects ! I suppose it comes back to that unknown fear of what is to come !  Can anyone give advise or things to avoid I know about the fruit juice !  Cheers  Vicki x",
