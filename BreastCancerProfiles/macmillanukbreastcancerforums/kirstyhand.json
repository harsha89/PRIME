    "Content": "Hi all, I was just wondering if someone could shed some light on mamograms? My Grandmother died from breast cancer an 60 years old and my mother first had breast cancer at 42 and has since had it twice more and also my mothers sister has had breast cancer 3 times from age 40 and my fathers aunty is currently undergoing chemo for breat cancer. I vaugely remember being told when my mother first had breast cancer that I would be required to have a mamogram at age 32 (10 years earlier than when my mother got cancer) but I have not heard anything else and am now coming up to 33 years of age. Is this something that I need to talk to my doctor about or just wait? Many thanks kirsty",
