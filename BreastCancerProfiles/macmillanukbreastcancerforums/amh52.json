      "Content": "Hi Binny I had a bone scan in Nov after experiencing regular discomfort - like pressure - and pain on the right side of my chest for nearly a year.  My cancer was diagnosed on the left side (lumpectomy, lymph nodes removed, mastectomy, chemo & rads from Jan - Sept) and my right side was given all clear.  My GP requested the bone scan as a process of 'elimination' given my recent history - and that's how I had to force myself to look at it.  Having the bone scan did not mean 'oh s&^t we need to check for more cancer'.  It meant patient not happy - let's see what else is going on...... a difficult mind shift given our experience to date but I had to hold on to that.  And I hope it might help you too.  The procedure is exactly as George & Jackie described.  I found it a piece of cake after chemo.  The injection was the only slight discomfort.  There was a couple of hours hanging around but so what - and the scan doesn't touch you so nothing there.  Certainly didn't feel claustrophobic. My scan came back clear.  Still don't know exact cause - current thinking something muscular -  but cancer has been eliminated. So big hug as I do know how worrying it can be when we now feel any discomfort or pain.  But the bone scan is straightforward and, in our cases, essential.  We need to know what's going on. Take care of yourself. Anne-Marie x",

      "Content": "Hi there.  One thing to remember is that you'll be getting increasingly tired as you go through the treatments.  Although I managed Tax overall better than FEC I could feel it was getting harder and harder to just generally cope with the days.  And with that come all sorts of emotions, in particular weeping buckets.   And it's as if a sort of cabin fever begins to set in as the chemo sessions go on. But the end is in sight!  Do you have something nice to look forward to?  Have you a reward lined up for yourself?  I wanted the chemo all over by the time my son's school holidays were due to start last summer. Keep going.  You're almost there!  Big hugs.  Anne-Marie xx",

      "Content": "Ah, the hair thing.... It was/is the biggest issue for my son.  But the fact that friends his age didn't bat an eyelid at my exotic range of headscarves seemed to help him forget.   And on Monday I eventually got a wig even though I hope my hair will be back in the autumn.  I didn't do cold cap because I didn't want to have to deal with anything else on top of the chemo.  And my hair was never very thick anyway.  I wish now I'd gone for a wig at the outset because I would've looked as normal as possible for my son.  But again, I had this notion that wigs would be uncomfortable and hot.  In fact I'm finding the one I've got really quite comfortable and helps me feel 'normal'.  I also wear a little 'nightcap' I bought from a website called amoena which specialises in mastectomy/chemo items.  So, my son has only once seen me without anything on my head.  Oh - and I did have my shoulder length hair cut very short just before chemo started.  Now that was traumatic!!  But longer term it helped when it started falling out - less to deal with. So, if your hair does go, could you work out a plan B?  Maybe start looking at wigs?  I've gone blond! And everybody is saying 'wow, suits you!'  Even my ex-partner who doesn't mince his words.... Re chemo; FEC was certainly the most difficult for me.  Not that Tax was without its problems but first dose of FEC absolutely floored me and I felt so ill.  Onc reduced subsequent doses by 20% it was that bad.  If you want to know more about Tax, just say but it is absolutely true that people respond to these drugs differently.  As for holidays, is there any chance you could book something for when you get through the chemo at Centre Parcs or Bluestone park in Wales for a few days?  Not Gran Canaria I admit but maybe your kids will enjoy that too.  Someone said that as they worked through the chemo, their child got some lego every time a chemo cycle was over.  I started doing a similar thing on a very small scale for my son too - just little things like moshi monsters arriving from amazon etc. Anyway, must dash.  Hope you're ok and able to enjoy the w/end.  Take care Anne-Marie x",

In fact, even up to about age 6 he'd still stroke it for comfort.  He was really worried about the hair loss but he's grown use to it and looking forward to my hair coming back..  But it must be so hard to explain to a 4yr old.   I'm sure you will have thought of this already, but can I make a suggestion in case you haven't?  You mentioned having your husband and older children helping out while you're in chemo.  Could you get them to consider how they would manage to run the house, plan food and support the younger children on the basis of you being out of action for 2 weeks out of every 3?  As you've very young children, it might be helpful to assume this in order to make sure so many things are covered, particularly when young children are so dependent.   I say this not to scare you but because I had absolutely no idea how I would respond to the chemo and was pretty naive.  I tried to brave it out and got a hell of a shock when the first dose absolutely floored me. And despite my son's father's best efforts, there were still a number of things I had to cover that he couldn't anticipate because we hadn't planned or talked about it.  I managed better on the 2nd drug, Docetaxol and was up and about much more but it was still tiring.   Hope you don't think I'm interfering but I really sympathise with you having such young children.  Fingers crossed it's all straight forward for you.

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Just wondered if anyone else has experienced the following?  A few days after 1st cycle of docetaxol, I had a mouth infection.  Thought it was oral thrush but Doc said fungal and was prescribed flucanazole.  Within a couple of days of starting that, I had an itchy rash on my chest.  I - stupidly - also sat out on our patio for about 30 to 40 mins taking a phone call while the sun was shining.  Was feeling very exhausted and just glad to have a bit of light. Rash started to spread on my hands and forearms quickly, as well as face.  Went back to hospital and doc said to stop flucanazole straight away.  Rash continued.  Went back couple of days later and was given steriods and type of piriton to calm flaming skin.  Went back the following day to hospital as skin was now incredibly itchy and lips swollen.  Was given much stronger anti-histamine for 7 days.   I should also add that I was taking injections to boost white-blood cells at same time.   Skin did calm down over a few days.  I stayed indoors and weather was dull.  Last Saturday, however, thinking the coast was clear, I took my son to the local park for an hour.  I was wrapped up with scarf, hat, sunglasses, gloves, coat with collar up, long trousers.  Looked very attractive - not!  It wasn't sunny but kept my back to where the sun would've have been as much as possible. Well, that evening my skin went bananas again.  I was up all night with ice packs and cold cloths.  Lips swelled really badly this time - like a nightmarish botox job!  Skin was on fire with itchy pinpricks and tongue swollen too.  Was back in hospital 9am the following morning.  Even the Onc said he didn't recognise me this time.  Was kept in for observation, given extra steriods and managed to get through 2nd chemo cycle the following day. Onc is at loss to understand cause of allergic reaction.  I'm not normally allergic to any foods or medicines.  TAX isn't normally associated with reactions to sunlight although I have since read of one study in the US stating a woman suffered skin allergy after tanning and on TAX.  I'm now housebound!  Might try outing on very dull days with factor 50.  But very interested to know if anyone has had similar side effects and what you did about it.  Didn't have this problem on FEC.  Still difficult time but that's another story! Hope everyone is ok and enjoying the warmer weather more than I am! Many thanks Anne-Marie x",

      "Content": "Hi Nicola I developed a very bad itchy rash after receiving Tax and there was - in my case - a definite connection between sunlight and the chemo.  I didn't experience any skin problems with FEC (altho plenty of other side effects!) so I had to put the rash down to Tax. Rash covered my face, hands and feet - areas that had been exposed when I sat out in the sun for 30mins a few days after receiving the first Tax. My approach was to stay out of the sun or cover up as much as possible, use only aquaeous cream on skin, drink loads of water.  It got so bad a couple of times I ended up back in hospital where the doctors prescribed further steriods to keep the reaction to a minimum.  But it was a very tough time and so exhausting as difficult to sleep or rest with itching - like pinpricks stabbing the skin. My face and hands swelled up a bit but my lips looked like they'd been through a really bad botox job.  Very swollen. I'm a month post chemo and now in radiotherapy.  I apply factor 50 to my face everyday under make-up.  I didn't put the cream on my hands the other day and - hey presto! rash appeared but was less severe this time. I was - and still am - surprised this reaction to Tax came as a surprise to the oncs!  My senior onc reckoned the skin should no longer be affected after about 6 weeks post chemo.  A nurse, however, told me the skin can be affected for a couple of years!!! Don't know if this is in any way similar to your circumstances but if you've any questions, do get in touch.  Hope you're near the end of chemo! All the best Anne-Marie",

      "Content": "Hi Rosalyn Really sorry to hear you've had a such tough time.  It must be very scary to think that you might be at risk of further infection.  I had FEC reduced by 20% after the first dose last year.  And I think all subsequent doses of FEC & Tax were reduced too.  The lead oncologist was not happy about this but it was suggested by another doctor when I was taken back to hospital a couple of days after the first FEC barely conscious.  I just could not stay awake, felt awful and developed a very bad urine infection (no idea if related but it was not a good time.) I by no means sailed through the rest of the chemo.  It was tough.  And the question lurked in my mind - what if I wasn't giving the chemo my best shot by taking a weaker dose?   But then a friend of a friend who's an oncologist told me that a) an 80% dose is still a pretty big amount to hit the cancer with b) it was far better that I continue and complete the chemo than give up. It sounds to me that you need to have a frank conversation with your onc team and possibly take someone with you to take notes.  You've come so far that the end of chemo is in sight.  I've no idea how to stop neutropenic sepsis - not a medic. But I had injections to keep my white blood count up, took a spoon of high grade manuka honey every day, which is supposed to support the immune system, and drank buckets of water. Good luck Rosalyn.  Take a deep breath and keep going.... Anne-Marie xx  ",

Big hugs for the road ahead. Anne-Marie x p.s. Had 9 lymph nodes removed.  Chemo hasn't interfered with healing but haven't been able to do exercises sometimes if flat out with chemo.  Arm then tends to play up a bit so motto is, exercise the arm. p.p.s was absolutely traumatised before going to mastectomy.  But turned out recovery from it was a doddle, seriously.  Fingers crossed will be for you too.",

      "Content": "Hi there. I too had a very difficult experience last year.  It was particularly when I took docetaxol.  Exhausted I stupidly sat outside for about 20 mins in sunshine speaking on the phone.  No sunscreen.  Well I paid for it - skin became incredibly sensitive to light and very very itchy, lips swollen and distorted, hands and feet were affected too. Had a couple of trips to hospital for extra steriods and antihistamines when it got so bad.   I ended up staying indoors for the rest of the chemo (about 7 weeks), heading out after dark for a trip round the local tesco when no-one else was around to see me! I used kids sensitive factor 50 continuously for the rest of the year.  My skin is now back to normal and there are no marks.  But I'll be taking a lot more care this year - and the next.... So PLEASE protect yourselves.  I don't know why there isn't more information about this.  I guess not everyone is affected. Take care Anne-Marie x",

And I promise you another thing - there are guys out there who are hooked on the woman they love and admire them, particularly for what they've gone through, not just for a boob! Be good to yourself, get the make-up on and get out.  Hope you've got some good girlfriends around - if not, talk to us. Take care AM x (currently with one very small 32a boob!)",

I've looked at your profile.  You're young and clearly very fit, running a 10k.  You've brought up kids which is no mean feat.  You have grandchildren to love. And you are a fighter. Can you put your finger on exactly are you scared of?  We can help here with information, advice and support.  But at some point that fighting spirit of yours is going to have to come out with massive gloves on.  It's time to take some control of what is about to happen to you.  So, 1.  Practical preparation.  Start drinking lots of water. Have you got a good thermometer?  Who is going to accompany you to the sessions?  Have you decided if you're going for a wig or using scarves and hats? etc etc etc 2. Plan good things to do.  Things you really want to do.  Ok world cruise is out of the question.  But Marg here threw a party.  I booked a holiday for the end of chemo in a caravan with my son, my sister and her family.  Shop til you drop. Watch Channing Tatum in the scuddy.  Whatever works for you.... Get back in the driving seat Angel.  This is might not what you want to hear at the moment but you've said you're a fighter and now is the time to fight your fears and your nerves.  Last year forced me to dig really really deep to keep calm and keep going. So it can be done. Hope the sun is shining for you today.  Anne-Marie x",

      "Content": "Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling so low.  Believe me - and you will see from the posts here - you are not alone in feeling as you do.  There are plenty of us who have really difficult times. Friends/no friends, partners/deserters, guilt cos cancer wasn't that serious/cancer very serious etc etc. If there's one thing I learned last year when going through the whole treatment is that actually we really are often truly alone.  And we need to be so so strong to deal with the terror of the diagnosis, the physical pain of the arduous treatment and the enormous upheavel to our lives. Whether you have family and friends around you or not, it's you who has to deal with cancer head on.  Yes the media can distort the truth but last year I came across an article in the Huffington Post titled Nobody Shaved Their Head for Me.  It talked about the different stages friends/family go through when hearing of your diagnosis; from rallying round frantically to silence.  And I personally identified with what the author said.  It made me feel someone out there understood the isolation, the resentment about the situation I found myself in, the disappointment of 'friends' and  the hard slog to get through the treatment. So how to respond to cancer and its impact on our lives?  I can't presume to tell you what to do.  The one thing I would say is, it seems to me there's been a lot in your life affecting the way you are feeling now - and it's not just your breast.  But where to begin?  Ironically, for some people dealing with cancer has forced them to have a damn good look at their lives and figure out what they don't want anymore.  In your situation, is it being on your own?  Other good folks will respond to you with their thoughts.  I hope you are able to take heart from the group here and even possibly start responding to some who are desperate.  You say you've had an 'unconventional' life.  That to me reads 'interesting' life.  I'd like to hear more about it and I bet some of your life experiences might at some point help others. Take care.  Keep in touch. Anne-Marie x",

Hope you have a more peaceful night.  Big hugs to you too. Anne-Marie xx",
