      "Content": "Hi, My relative had her lumpectomy. There was no lymp involvement which is good news but they have told her she will need another operation in 10 days time. Apparently there will be a meeting on Tues to see what they decide on doing. What does this actually mean? What decisions do they make at the meetings? I thought maybe they would just go in again to get what is remaining? I guess it is not that straightforward? Any advice would be appreciated. They already told her before the lumpectomy that she will be having radiation so does anyone know if this may change now she needs another operation. Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me, I really appreciate it. We live abroad so what we get told over the phone is all that we have to go on. Our relative is in her late 70s so it is really hard for us being that she is getting on as it were. We are just hoping that she doesn't have to go through chemo as well as radiotherapy I guess that decision will be made. Is tis like starting all over again time frame wise? Thanks again",

      "Content": "Hi All My relative had her second operation and they told her today that she has to wait 6 weeks for her radiotherapy?? In the meantime they will also decide if she will be having Chemotherapy, this is the first time they mentioned Chemotherapy and we thought the radiotherapy would be in 3-4 weeks which is what they first told us. My question is what has changed here? Just trying to understand instead of asking too many questions of my relatives. Thank you",
