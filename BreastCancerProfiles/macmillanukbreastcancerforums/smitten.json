      "Content": "Hi I wrote on here a few weeks ago now with concerns about my right breast. I ended up seeing a GP 8th December 2015.She thought the redness on my breast was damage caused by radiotherapy but decided to write to the breast nurse any way. I waited and waited and nothing happened, I telephoned the surgery to ask if the GP had written to the breast nurse and was told she had written Prior to Christmas. On the 5th January 2016 I had an appointment to see the plastic surgeon booked since November. The breast nurse was in the meeting and the PS kept asking if I had any questions so I mentioned my concerns about the remaining breast, and the breast nurse initially denied knowing anything about it. Until I stated the GP thought the redness was caused by radiation. She then said oh yes I do remember this. The PS asked to look and examined me, he said it was all ok but could not give me an answer as to why it was red, but did say radiation would not have caused it and asked when I was due to have another mammogram. Funny enough I'm due in 2 days, no more was said about the breast. Apart from one of the nurses who asked if it was my bra causing the redness. I said I didn't think so as when I don't wear a bra it is the same. When I got home I felt relieved that the PS was not worried about the breast, and told myself to stop worrying. The next day I decided to have a pajama day as I was off sick from work with a virus. I also wanted to see what would happen if I didn't wear my bra all day. By the end of the day my breast looked really bad, purple and bruised and very discolored, so I took several photo's on my mobile phone and my kindle, as I thought I was seeing things and imagining what I thought I could see and making it up. Two days later I went along for my annual mammogram and was asked if I had any concerns, I explained it all to the radiologist who said she would put a note on my form. She said I may get a recall back. I asked if I could see my mammogram and she also showed me last years, there does not look any difference in them. Tomorrow it will be a week since having the mammogram, and the anxiety is still with me, the breast continues to deteriorate. At times it just looks a bit pink, but by around 3-4 in the afternoon and for the rest of the day it looks bruised, sometimes bright pink/red, now looks a bit like orange peel. Am I going mad??? My sister came for lunch today, and on the funny side I told her I wanted to see her breasts, as I have nothing to compare it with as I had a mastectomy 2 & 1/2 years ago now. Hers looked very large and white and not red or pink at all. I also showed her the photo's and she suggested that if I get the all clear on the mammogram and I'm not happy still and have the same symptoms I should go back to the GP and show them the photo's. Does anyone have any advice or experience of IBC, my concern is it spreads quite quickly and it has now been at least 2 months since I noticed the redness. Sorry for the long message, thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Thanks Mistymoley for replying. I was awake until 04.00am and couldn't sleep. Yes I have mentioned it to the onologist and it is thanks to her that I now have an appointment next Tuesday with the colorectal team for further investigations. It is exactly 2 years since getting the breast cancer diagnosis and was all clear and no secondries. So I'm thinking this cannot be happening can it, and I have to still go to work later today and smile and just get on with things, as it may be just what you have advised that some how all the treatments have actually corrected a life long problem, be good if it is. Thank you for listening",

I only saw the lymphoedema nurse this Monday, and she was really pleased as my arm has gone down and I don't even need to wear the compression sleeve now. Would I get it in my right breast as well??? I will ring her for advice though. Thanks for the comment.",

      "Content": "Hi jltandreilly - I was originally diagnosed with Paget's disease and then 2 weeks later with invasive breast cancer after they also found 2 lumps in the left breast. The reason I had a mastectomy was due to the lumps one either side of the nipple so the choice was taken away from me, I also had level 1 of my lymph nodes removed, the first one being positive. I had chemo, rads and one year of Herceptin. Reason when they examine the tissue they found lots of cancer cells in the breast tissue which was removed. At the time I was told they throw everything at you to cure you. Hope this helps",

      "Content": "Wow what a great way to put it Jacky, I felt quite emotional reading all of these posts. I am old school now March 2013 and don't come on here as often as I'm back at work doing 4 days a week. It's still a struggle after 2 years and the fatigue still gets me down but I do feel I have some normality now. I don't think you ever completely get over it but things do improve. I lost my mother-in-law when I was going through my treatment she was given 3 months to live and lasted 9 weeks and died of pancreatic cancer and I attened her funeral and said a poem with my bald head and ghostly appearance. How lucky am I to still be here. My colleagues don't really have a clue what it's all about and I'm sure some of them wish I had never returned as I can't run about like they do now. I just do my job and make the best of my free time with my husband anf family. Everyone who has had cancer is amazing and we all have our own personal journey. Sending hugs to every one and keep coming on this site as it is an inspiration. xx",

I now take antihistamines daily, but the nose doesn't stop dripping, it's also getting embarrassing when out or trying to eat. I need to remember to have a constant supply of tissues or kitchen paper. Has anyone got any advice.",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, I am really struggling to get back to work as well. I am currently on a phased return doing three days a week. I started working 4hrs each day, and worked the Monday, Wednesday and by the Friday had a sore throat and by the weekend could not speak. Ended up having more time off, using the last of my A/L up and then a week sick. Went back to work for two weeks and I'm off again with another bad throat and cough which is keeping me awake and making me sick coughing so much. I did have a telephone consultation with occupational health yesterday who told me to go sick until the end of next week, I also have several follow-up appointments next week. It is hard though as I was officially off work for a year and there has been so many changes in that year. They have even chganged the computer system and i have had trouble even working out how to send an email, and had elearning to do to get back up and running again with the computer. If that's not hard enough when you feel physically unwell, and sleep is restricted due to coughing, it makes it harder to concentrate at work. Everyone is being really supportive, but this is the second time I've been off and I've only been back 5 weeks, so I think i may have probles like SusieMF had. I am not entitled to any pay either now, so finances are also a factor in not wanting to stay off too long. I do have a serious question though regarding finances. I got paid out on an insurance claim on diagnosis, and while it's not enough for me to give up work, I'm 57 in July. It's not enough to pay off my morgage and wouldn't even pay 1/4 of it and I have a interest only mortgage. So the money is in the account and we have had to use a bit of it as I went onto half pay last July. Then if I didn't return to work by the 8th Jan this year they would have stopped my pay completely. The dilemma is I won't have any sick pay to come at all now. If I end up loosing my job because I can't go back would I be able to claim anything with money in the bank, Officially I can't get my government pension until I'm 66. It's all very confusing. I'm also waiting for some results for my hip on Tuesday following a pelvis X-ray.",

I went home with a drain in situ and the district nurse's came out daily to check the drain, which was removed after a week. I had a good recovery after the op. Make sure you do the exercises they give you as this will help to relief future problems like lymphodemia. Then I started chemotherapy and then radiotherapy, and it all seemed like such a long process and when I was going through it I never thought I would ever return to a normal life and work again. I have just started back to work this week on a phased return, and the work place seems very over welming at the moment but like getting through a diagnosis of paget's disease and invasive breast cancer I can see the wood for the trees as they say. It has not all been plain sailing and there were problems along the way, but now I'm coming out the other side. Hope it all goes well for you Hope. I'm here if you need to ask any thing, or just want to have a rant. Much love Vicky x",

      "Content": "Hi Sixpence I have had a similar experience to you. I had a MX last March, then chemo and then radio. I was off for around 10months. Signed back to work in January and took 6 wks A/L as my money was due to stop 8th Jan 14. By the time I went back on a phased return I had been off for a year nearly and it was mid-Feb and I was absolutely dreading it. There was a new computer system in place and I couldn't find anything. I'm a community mental health nurse working in a crisis team and some of the paperwork and policies have also change. Since being back I'm still on a phased return and I have had a couple of bad wobbles at work, crying and not feeling like I could cope with it all. I was back one week and I got a viral infection and bad cough and went off sick for nearly 2 wks, went back and got a sore throat and cough again, went off again for nearly another 2 wks, although that was following a telephone consultation with Occ Health and they advised I went sick. I was also waiting to have bone scan for really bad hip pain which was waking me at night, and for my annual follow-up with surgeon. I think I got myself in a bit of a state with it all. So since the start of my phased return I have been off sick twice for nearly 4 wks. My manager has been absolutely brillian and so supportive. They are just so pleased I'm back at work as another staff member went sick 3 months before me, also with breast cancer and she has taken early retirement. I am now back up doing 3 shifts a week, and from tomorrow will be doing 7hrs. So hope to be full-time by another couple of weeks. I'm not being counted in the numbers at work either or being put in charge while on the phased return which has taken the pressure off. Sorry this is so long winded but wanted to answer honestly. If you want to ask anything else please do. It seems such a long journey at times, but when I first went sick, I didnot know if I would ever get back to work, so it does get better and poeple to eventually get through and come out the other side. Good luck with it all every one xx",
