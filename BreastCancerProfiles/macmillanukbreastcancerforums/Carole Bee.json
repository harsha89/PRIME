    "Content": "Go for it ! This is my second chemo in 3 years and after only two treatments this time, I had a sore arm and the canular problems everyone else mentioned.  I was then offered PICC line, which I was dithering about, until someone happened to mention that Herceptin would be administered as a drip.  That tipped the scale :)  The only slight pain involved was the local anaesthetic, but altogether, it was popped in with great efficiency and the doctor was kind and chatty.  Would recommend this to anyone facing chemo, wish I had it in sooner.  No problems except some irritation from dressings from time to time, but compared to the miserable anticipation of  \"just a shap scratch\" three times each session, PICC line wins hands down.  I call at my Doctors surgery every week (hospital is 40 miles away) and they flush it and re-dress and take bloods as and when needed.  Good luck.",
