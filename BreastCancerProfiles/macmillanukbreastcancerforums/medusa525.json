Thanks for all your lovely messages of support i was struggling with my first chemo due in a few days i have still been teary but i am doing ok. I just seem to be having such a problem with preparing myself for  my first chemo? i did so well with my mastectomy? i say to people its not like they will be pumping marshmallows and rainbows into me! lol I am also unsure what to do with my hair....i know its probably a given i will lose my hair i will be getting FEC chemo x6. I would shave it off now but my partner/family /friends tel me to wait.....just to see if it actually does fall out? so i am unsure what to do? i can totally shave it off without a problem i was just wondering what everyone else did or thought?

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I hope everyone is doing well I wanted to ask the community if they know of any vitamins or natural treatments for Neuropathy? I completed my treatment last Nov i had FEC x 6 and 20 x Radiotherapy i didnt have the T part of FEC. It is very rare to have Neuropathy on just FEC so trust me to be a rarity! lol i saw my Oncologist the other day and i asked her in the years she has been an Oncologist (she has been doing it for prob 20yrs!)  has she seen this before and she replied....No! to which i burst out laughing lol i couldnt help it. I had a terrible time on FEC made me really ill and my neuropathy started half way through but it wasn't bad. When i completed my treatment my hair grew back in and at the start of this year promptly fell out again! again doesn't usually happen and my eyebrows didn't really grow back so i got semi permanent makeup which actually look nicer than mines ever did so happy with that lol. My Neuropathy is really bad i have lost the feeling in both feet.....thats actually a contradiction as i feel awful pain in them! I have also developed a dropped left foot so i cant walk without a stick because of that and my balance is really bad I have also lost nearly all the feeling in my hands so my grip isnt very good. At the moment my GP who has been fab has tried a few things at the moment we are trying Gabapentin so we will see how that goes!  I just wanted to ask the community of any treatments advice etc? I want to add as well to anyone who is on FEC at the moment and is reading this dont panic! it is VERY rare to have the problems i have because of FEC so dont worry! and if you do have any funny feelings in your hands or feet tell your nurse/oncs doctors straight away! Mines started as a minor vibration in my right foot. Big hugs  Mx",
