      "Content": "Thanks everyone to all your replies.  Talk about a very steep learning curve! Basically had a very ropey first four days, when I felt pretty nauseous, was pretty jittery and had the worst case of acid reflux.  Chemo nurse told me to take Gaviscon which is a vile substance and made me retch.  (Okay, it did work a bit...)  By day 5 I was out walking in the village and by day 6 was driving about.  I'm going back to the gym tomorrow (day 12).  Hopefully it won't get worse than this, but apparently the effects are cumulative.  Darn. Kath, I did use the cold cap and my word, the torture.  Talk about an instant migraine.  I haven't made up my mind whether or not I will continue to use it for succeeding treatments.  Going for chemo is traumatic enough, and having to add an instant migraine to the mix is not the best... My next treatment is on the 25th, and I've decided to treat it like I'm going to have a flu so will be incapacitated for the next week or so.  I'll get better for 2 weeks, then the flu again.  I have 4 FEC treatments in total, every 3 weeks.  I then move to Taxol weekly for 12 weeks.  I will then have surgery and radiotherapy.  It's going to be a long year...
