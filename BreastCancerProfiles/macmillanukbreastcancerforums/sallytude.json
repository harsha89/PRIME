    "Content": "Hello Lizzy Although I am here to blab about my moans whilst my darling is being diagnosed with lung, I will say I have experience of wigs because I have auto immune issues and one 'bonus' is my own alopecia (auto immune permanent hair loss) I dont have help via nhs for my 'units' (wigs) but buy them all myself.  I guess choice of wig really depends if you like to 'fling rat off' at end of day (my choice)  or keep on up to 6 weeks - (the more natural looking solution with real hair) I think top tips would be security is priority. 1.  double sided tape along edges of wig (if only forehead and temples) is a must,  2. if unit is synthetic, getting rid of that 'sheen', because they tend to be shiny in spotlights or sunlight - batiste dry shampoo spray is fab for this - spray v carefully on dark wigs though, as it makes them look ashy.  And  if the wig has no fringe, you can make 'baby hairs' along the temple trimming shorter lengths, to give a gradual look, rather than a blunt frontal. (front hairline) finally if anyone says to use synthetic wig shampoo - dont!  I let mine sit in a sink full of water with 2 in 1 clothing liquid, rinse and it comes out soft and beautiful, then set with hot rollers or tongs whilst damp I had heaps of  wig malfunctions (I wear a brown to blond ombre coloured shoulder length  wavy synthetic wig) ebay number 361296895430 the worst malfunction was with a different wig, I was with a consultant at hospital.  During appt,  I managed to get my hair caught in a twist of oxygen tubing that was draped behind my chair. ... and because my hair was so thick with hairspray it took my poor consultant 5 whole dreadful minutes  to untangle for me He was very posh, so kept very calm and didnt giggle --  you see until that point, he thought my hair was my own. Until I said 'Oh let me just remove it and leave it dangling on wall!!  In the end, he unwrapped a dressings kit, fumbled for the bandage scissors, and to completely free me, lopped a bit of wig off.  :)  Finally ebay (china especially) are masterclass when it comes to styled wigs, that are also so cheap and realistic.  hope you have no more egg head moments!  Sally xx p.s. sorry if my wig tips are not supposed to be posted here -- still feeling my way around the site!",
