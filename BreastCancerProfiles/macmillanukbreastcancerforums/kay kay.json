I was fine with the radio, no burns but have started with the soreness too! i went back to the breast care nurses last week who thought it was still the after effects from radio. they gave me doublebase cream which is helping a bit, i was not happy when the soreness started i can tell you!!   k xx",

I found my lump 2 years ago in march 2011, i've had all the treatment and im now on tamoxifen and trying to get back to my'normal' life! My question is how does everyone cope emotionally with going for 6month check ups and yearly mammogram (my 6 mth check up is tomorrow) i am really apprehensive and nervous.Ive managed to not think about it and now it's looming over me!!  ",
