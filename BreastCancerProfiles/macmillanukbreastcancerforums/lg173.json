    "Content": "Hi i have finally decided i have not got over and coping with my breast cancer as well as i would like and feel it is still effecting my life too much ie: embarresed about my body, dont like to talk about it, can easily cry if start talking about it - also dont seem to be really happy - am i too worried !!!! about everything !!!!!! has anybody recieved counselling either privately or from an organisation that helped them - i am not an easy person as ask too many questions and am quite blunt, embarressed/not really able to talk about my illness and think i would be a difficult patient so any suggestions for my type of personality would be great - have thought about doing an open university course in counselling or something that might help me (yes this is the sort of strange person i am) Thanks Lesley",
