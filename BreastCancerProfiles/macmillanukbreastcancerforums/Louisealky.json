      "Content": "Hi I was 'diagnosed' yesterday with suspected DCIS but told the pathologists were in disagreement with my consultant over pre invasive v invasive status of the 3cm triple negative tumour. My nodes were clear, but I'm now starting to feel aches in my shoulders and pain in a small spot on my chest above my left breast where the lump is. Now convinced I have bone secondaries even though I'm desperately hoping that the dcis diagnosis is correct. My consultant said it will be Friday next week before he knows for sure. How do I get through the next few days? I'm depressed and can't see anyone, shut myself in with my daughter and don't want to face the world at all. If anyone can give me the benefit of their experience I'd be grateful. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thank you Shaz, I'm just absolutely petrified. I can't cope with looking after my little girl I can't think about anything else, I'm consumed by fear that the cancer is invasive, and because it's triple negative and Because I'm convinced it's spread already that I won't survive. I know it's the wrong attitude and I just want to know how I can get myself on the right track. I'm usually such a positive person and yet can't fight my way through this fog. I feel like giving up before it's even started. X",
