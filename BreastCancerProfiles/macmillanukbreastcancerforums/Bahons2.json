      "Content": "Really pleased that Bren and Jules have had such good care from their local GP surgeries, but why be 'grateful' for this? (Better perhaps to be grateful in a general sense to live in a country where it is possible to get good healthcare?). The NHS isn't a charity - we've all paid for it through taxes, NI contributions, VAT, fuel duty, hospital car parking charges, you name it - and so we're all entitled to courteous, efficient, compassionate, co-ordinated and timely treatment. We shouldn't be amazed when paid staff do their job properly; we should be furious when they don't. Sorry....had a bit of a rant here!",

      "Content": "Sorry Kerste - I don't like the website much. While I can accept that being overweight, for example, increases the risk of breast cancer, I feel that the causes of, say, breast cancer are an extremely complex jigsaw and that overpromotion of some risk factors at the expense of others is not helpful when the complex mix of genetic, environmental, dietery and lifestyle factors, plus others we may not yet even dream of, is, I feel, nowhere near unravelled yet. As for 'everything to do with breast cancer', where is the section on lymphoedema?",

      "Content": "Hi blossom Sorry to hear you are so uncomfortable. Are you getting any help with the lymphoedema? Treatment at your nearest clinic? If you are not, try to get a referral (from GP, onc, bcn) asap. They should be able to help you with kinesio taping, massage, a compression top, stuff like that. If you are getting help, perhaps you need more. Anti-inflammatories might help, if you aren't taking them already. Swimming is also good for lymphoedema, if you like it and there is no medical reason why you can't go - don't overdo it at first. I don't think Arimidex causes lymphoedema - (the surgery and radiotherapy will be the root cause of that) altho' I suppose that if it causes breast swelling, it might increase a tendency to retain fluid.... This website has an excellent section on breast lymphoedema: www.stepup-speakout.org There are more links to useful sites on the 'Lymphoedema' thread in this Breast Cancer Forum Hope this helps a bit X S",

      "Content": "To say to anyone thinking of refusing chemotherapy... Why are you contemplating refusing to use one of the major weapons against bc? It's not cheap and if it's recommended for YOU, it's for a very good reason and that is that it may save your life. That reason has always been good enough for me! Yes, chemotherapy can have some very nasty side effects (Radiotherapy too). But so does cancer, the best known of which is death. No lymph node spread does NOT equal no chance of recurrence; it means there is LESS chance. Julie, as a 'triple negative', ie neither hormone therapy (Tamoxifen, Arimidex, etc) nor Herceptin is appropriate for you. In that case, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are literally all you have. The 'as a precaution' is to mop up any stray cancer cells that may be circulating in your body, so think carefully. I think you'd be mad to refuse. Sorry to be so blunt. X S",
