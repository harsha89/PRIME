    "Content": "Hi, First time doing this, so hopefully done this right! I am  having FEC-T  and have  had my first treatment  this morning, i tried the cold cap but could not stand it. I had my surgery 4 weeks ago a full mastectomy and full node clearance , have cording as well, so just thought not worth putting myself through that as well.  I have epilepsy and get headaches due to my Medication anyway, (not much down for me is there!!!!!) I have an awful headache and just feel really drained, is it usual to feel like this on the first day of treatment ? I know i will  get through this and be ok at the end of it all, just trying to  stay as positive as i can. Lynda. x",
