Nodes clear but chemo and radiotherapy planned because I'm only 31. Unfortunately didn't get clear margins so had another op. This too has come back unclear and they say the cancer is all gone but there are alot of pre cancerous cells so are now saying i need a mastctomy.  Im just so disheartened and feel so sad at the thought of another op. What is recovery like for a mastectomy with reconstruction? I have a 1 year old and 3 year old and I'm worried about the impact this will have on them.  Thank you in advance ",

I have finished chemo 5 weeks ago and it hasn't been too bad at all, got through with very mild side effects.  It's such a personal choice but just wanted to share mine.

I have a couple of reasons for this;  Im quite large busted and feel really worried and stressed that I might not be able to spot a lump on my good boob. I really don't want to live with the stress of it. I know it could come back somewhere else but at least I'm reducing its options!  Secondly, I dont want a huge implant in the first boob so it's a similar size to my other. I would rather just have them done together so they match? Also I suppose I don't necessarily need the second one removed completely just reduced?  Has anyone requested this? Had experience of this?  Are the NHS likely to do this or do I need to look into it privately? ",

It now looks like it's has been bleeding where my bra sits. Under the boob. I rang the ward and they said that the thick brown waxy dressings that I have are designed to stay on as long as possible so if it's not hurting, bloody coming through the bandage and I'm feeling ok then it should be fine. Had anyone else had experience? I will obviously ring the breast care nurse on Monday. It's not hurting at all but I'm worried I've burst my stitches or something is going wrong beneath those dressings!! ",

      "Content": "I've had surgery to remove at grade 2, 2cm tumor. I had full node clearance and all nodes were clear apart from first sentile node. I'm currently waiting for my oncology appointment on the 23rd.  initially my BCN said 6 rounds of chemo then the next time I spoke to her she said 6 or 8. I just wondered how they decide between the 6 or 8? As they said it was really just a precaution because off my age I am really hoping it' the 6!  Thanks in advance, so much waiting around! I'm ready to start this now! sooner it' started the sooner it's finished! x",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for all the info everyone it' is really useful and gives me some good questions to ask at my oncology app.  Yes it's hormone positive and HER-. All they said is that as I am only 31 they would do chemo and as they like to throw everything at it to give it the best possible chance of it not coming back.  I will look into the oncotype test though as obviously if I could avoid it that would be better!  With regards to my full lymph node removal, when they did lumpectomy they test your first sentile node, if that comes back positive they remove them all. After my op and testing they all came back clear thank goodness x",

They aren't really bothering me unless I touch them and then they are itchy.  Thanks in advance again!!! ",

      "Content": "Hi Dizzy,  Sorry to hear the results weren't what you hoped. I kmow how stressful that waiting can be, I had full node clearance during my lumectomy as my sentile node came up positive for cancer cells. However after testing them all it was only that one. I guess I'm trying to say that it might not be as bad as you think.  The clearance is abit more painful than the lumpectomy and takes about longer to recover but I was back after work and looking after the kids after a week.  I'm back on the 1st of May for my second clearance. Keeping my fingers crossed that it's successful.  I'm here if you need a chat xx",

I feel so lucky they all came back clear and that it is still only grade 2. How long do you have to wait for results on 3rd lymph node? Are they going to remove any more.  I'm ready to start the chemo asap, I figure the sooner it starts the sooner it's finished x",
