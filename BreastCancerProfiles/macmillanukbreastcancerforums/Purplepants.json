My little squatter is triple negative, so do you think this means that I might be ok to continue on HR?  I had a total hysterectomy a few years back due to family history of breast and ovarian cancer, and have been on HRT since then, but as my breast cancer is not hormone recaptive,  I was wondering if it's likely they will say it's OK to keep using it or not....",

A sample was also taken from a slightly enlarged lymph node too. I have a family history of ovarian and breast cancer which is why I am having yearly mammograms at age 46, but I am freaking out somewhat. I feel like I have been waiting for this to happen actually. Me and my sisters have had hysterectomies due to the ovarian risk, but I feel like the clock has been ticking and that the big c would get me sometime soon, (my mum died when she was only 50 from ovarian cancer)...this year is 30 years since she died...sorry, feeling quite negative about it right now...   ",

I wonder whether this is fairly common. Regarding the pain, maybe there's something stronger you can take, but again your nurse should be able to advise. Also were you given a little heart shaped pillow to wedge under your affected arm? Mine is a godsend and I am still using it at night over 2 weeks later. Xxxxxxx",

I've been told it was grade 3 but that the ki67 would show the degree of aggressiveness and whether it's borderline grade 2 or not. Well I've been told it was 20-25% and from what I've seen on the Internet that is defined as \"high\" with 20% borderline. Regardless, I'm having chemotherapy,  it doesn't change anything treatment wise I know, I'm just interested. Xxxxxx",
