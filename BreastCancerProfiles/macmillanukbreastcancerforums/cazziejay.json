    "Content": "Hi Highland Mum Ginger biscuits great, same with ice lollies. I also put grapes in the freezer to suck on and of course you get a bit of goodness too. I swear by Manuka honey it has great anti bacterial properties. It is expensive 250g jar from Holland and Barrett Â£25 but i swear that is why I did not have very severe symptoms in my first cycle. I am on taxolcarbo - which will be different to yours. Start taking 2 natural senna tablets from day 1 until your bowels are back to normal they are very gentle. Chemo makes you constipated. Lots of bottles of ice cold fizzy mineral water - the bubles help with the mouth. Eat as much fruit and veg as you can - I really believe in lots of health giving foods to combat the chemo. Thats about it really. Do wish you well, I am having my second 3 weekly cycle tomorrow. Just got to think that tha lovely clear liquid they put in you is getting rid of all the nasties in your body. Good luck and lots of hugs Carole xxxxx",
