    "Content": "Hi, Just seen your message I had grade 2 ,two lumectomies and then a right side mastectomy and am in despair over the bra situation. I totally agree with you on the bra issue, why is it so diffucult when there are so many of us all over the world having problems just to feel normal and comfortable. My bra just wont stay in place and I am continually pulling it down not a good look being lob sided. As I had my last op in May and have hsd a big problem with fluid have not been fitted with the proper prothesis and am still using the softee issued on day of op, it just doesnt stay in place st all. As I had problems getti g a bra I made pockets in bras myself, the best ones eere from Matalan a pack of 2 black and white. Have since got a 2 from Nicloa Jane and they are ok .Â  So I am so sorry that you have been struggling all this time as I am quite new to the situation, please out there is anyone listening .",
