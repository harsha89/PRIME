      "Content": "I had my op on 19th July , this was followed up with visits to see the surgeon and breast cancer nurses . Now I am waiting to see an oncologist next week , I now have anxiety problems but there is no support . Everything happened so quickly , the scans the biopsy then the op , a check up then the wait . I will probably have to have radiotherapy ,but not in my nearest hospital .Did anyone else have mental health problems like me , did you have any support ?",

Perhaps people are wary of asking how I am ! Still , the only way is up ! fingers crossed I will feel better tomorrow ! Thanks again Jo .",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your post . My husband has been very supportive , I feel bad because the anxiety means I can hardly do anything , including eating !There are no Macmillan nurses at my hospital , I have tried to contact the two breast nurses but just get a message to say they were not available . It is a bit lonely , that is why I came on here . It doesn't help that my sister is on holiday as she rings me often . Thanks again for the hugs !",

I was being helped by a local mental health service but when I told them I had breast cancer they ended my CBT , which was done by phone . The last time I saw my GP she said I don't know what to do , neither do I . Best wishes , Carol",

This will mean going to yet another hospital ! and as you say it is exhausting. Hope you have a restful weekend . Carol",
