      "Content": "Hi I have been researching Letrozole and getting increasingly worried about the side effects.  My first pack is made by Cipla and according to my Dr is £3.75 per tablet.  I asked about two other brands that I had seen mentioned Vita and Sandoz and they are apparently  £76 per tablet so she would not change my brand.  Mind you I have put of starting them.  I need to get back to work, have no choice and I am already suffering with Hot flushes, aches and pains etc.,   I am 60 years old and like you have a full time job  ( been of for 8 months, return on Friday for 4 hours a day).  My cancer is hormone receptive. Have had FEC T, WLE and just finished 20 sessions of radiotherapy. Now getting all worked up about Letrozole/cancer and quality of life.  No one really wants to discuss the alternatives if I decide not to take it. Any advice would be appreciated. Like you I was fit and healthy until BC reared it's ugly head. Hope all is going well for you. Dilys x",

      "Content": "Hi I had axillary node and excision on Thursday. The area was glued and not stitched also no dressing. The wound has now weeped so community nurse put a dressing on it. Sunday my drain started to leak so community nurse rang my BC nurse who said to take it out. So far no build up of fluid. I was sent home with paracetomol and ibrufen which was great for a couple of days but I am now getting sharp pains like a knife being stuck in every so often, is that the nerve pain you mentioned? I am doing my exercises as terrified of getting lyphoedema. Any advise would be great. Thanks Dilys",

Two weeks ago found a broad bean size lump in left breast. It is pliable I think. Mammogram and ultrasound tomorrow. Decided as Dr was positive I would be. Now worrying. Anyone else had the same",
