      "Content": "Hello Was just wondering if anyone had any advice went to chemo consent clinic yesterday initially given start date Mon then they realised I need a Hickman line due to double mastectomy lymph node clearance on right and sentinel node biopsy on right confirming lymph node involvement. Am so cross and looking faith in my oncologist who should have spotted need for line after getting histology. Heard the Secretary laughing down the phone at the idea of me getting a date anytime soon saying she had finally managed to get another patient booked in for 2/11.  Any ideas how to speed things up hate the idea of the cancer still being allowed to grow whilst the hospital mess things up Thanks",

      "Content": "Hello there happy new year!  After my first session of EC chemo I had a very bad reaction to the steroids. I ended up admitted to a ward for 10 days because I had very high blood pressure and a very low white blood cell count otherwise I'm sure it would've been the psych ward I thought my mum was the devil, I had solved Isis but as a result my husband would lock me in the hospital room and beat me up for 6 weeks, I had agreed to be the sadest girl in the world in exchange for my son being father Christmas...it was dreadful for me and those around me and I am only just back to normal. I have had 2 more rounds of EC without steroids the latest one made me feel very sick but I was only sick 2 days. The original plan was to now have 3 sessions of doxitaxel sp? However they cant give that without steroids so my consultant is talking to my mental health worker to agree what is best. I'm so scared of not getting the strong chemo I need and dying or having the strong chemo and waking up with my life in tatters again (it really was horrific) any advice would be much appreciated .  Emily xx",
