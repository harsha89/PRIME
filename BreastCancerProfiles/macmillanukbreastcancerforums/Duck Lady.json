      "Content": "Hi All.. Following on from 2 biopsies I have been told I have to have my other breast removed now and all lymph nodes as I did 14 years ago! I am beyond words to be honest. I had a feeling the small lump was cancerouse but I was so praying for node negative.  I have never been free from pain over the last 14 years from the lymph extraction done then and cannot imagine how I am going to endure all this again.  I am not good with pain medication as it always seems to knock me for six and seriously upsets my stomach even with oeprezole. They will not know if it has spread in to other lymphs until they extract them all as the only biopsied one - thank god! How painful are these biopsies!! Thank god I had my husband holding my hand but I know its so hard for him too having to go through this a second time. I am waitimg for a date for surgery now but they said they are really busy.  The waiting is doing my head in and I am feeling ill with all the stress. How the hell do I get through all this again - can anyone tell me? I am falling apart here.",

I tried to use this site once before but gave up after awhile as it was causing me too much stress. Helen",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your lovely comments.  It is good to hear you being so positive after all you have been through.I am more afraid this time because I do not have the wonderful support and kindness of my dear sister Christine.  This horrible 'thing' took her life ten years ago.She hid herself away when the secondaries in her stomach bloated and disfigured her so badly that she would not see any of her family - every again.  She died alone in a hospice and I never got to tell her how much I loved her and what a hero she was for me throughout my lifetime with her.She promised me we would both be 'okay' and it was not so.  In fear of my cancer returning I elected to have a second mastectomy 3 years ago.  I prepared my self mentally for almost a year - determined this needed to be done. It was 30 minutes before I was due to have my surgery when the surgeon came to see me and said I had been sent to the 'wrong' hospital and he could not operate on me!! I should have been brave and awaited another date but instead I convinced myself that - it wasnt meant to be - someone up there was watching over me and saved me from who knows what! - I wimped out basically and now look where I am. Why did I not follow my first gut feeling and get rid of it back then! You said to let your feelings out,  I wish I could but I think my husband has had enough already. To be truthful I want to just stand on my cliff top and scream my head off until I cannot make another noise and then walk in to that sea below and believe me I have been looking at it. I think I am going crazy. So sorry to off load.Helen.",
