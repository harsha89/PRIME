    "Content": "Hi Catsue I have been fortunate not to have an infection yet, but I was told to ring the oncology ward asap if my tempreture reached 37.5. I think its best to let them decide. My son had an infection after every chemo session when he was having teatment and we were always advised to ring the ward, when we did we were told to take him in straight away eery time. Hope this helps. Kevin",
