    "Content": "Hiya, My first chemo I was sick/nauseous for the first 4 days then felt really weak and shaky for a couple after that. I also got a strange sensation where I felt like my skin was bruised...but it wasn't? ! My second session of FEC was worse. The sickness was horrific but I spoke to the oncologist and I'm starting on Docetaxel as of tomorrow so fingers crossed I take that better. Everyone is different. I spoke to a lady at chemo who hadn't been sick at all! I hope you keep well xxx Linsey (31)",
