From your answer I can deduce that if they do need to go in they can use a guide wire ultrasound then to locate cells. I wasn't aware of that. Hope everything is OK for you. It's hard isn't it. I had bowel cancer last year so I do understand a bit of what you're going through.  Hugs. Xxx  ",

      "Content": "Wondered whether you might know the answer to this?  Last June I was diagnosed with bowel cancer.  Now after a mammogram Pretty_cancerous cells have been found. yesterday I had them vacuumed out. They then insert a titanium marker incase they need to go back in again and remove more. They put the marker in,  at least they thought they had but then did THREE xrays and couldn't find it so it probably didn't go in. Do you know whether this will matter or Not? IM not seeing specialist for a couple of weeks so can't ask anyone. They said it had never happened before. I was also a bit worried to have three xrays instead of just one. If they do need to go back in they won't know where?",
