I was told not to vacum for a month to 6 weeks or put the washing out but to be honest that was ok for for the first week but now am back doing it, just have to be careful as my arm which the lymph node were taken does swell. I am based in the south west Bristol/Bath where are you   ramble -ramble Jan x",
