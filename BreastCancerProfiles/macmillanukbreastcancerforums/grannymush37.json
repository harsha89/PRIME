      "Content": "Hi Sacha I am like you and had invasive Lobular cancer. I have to admit the invasive bit wasn't known until after the surgery but although it was invasive my sentinal lymph node was clear so no spread. I had my surgery 6 weeks ago and got word today to go see the Oncologist to start Radiotherapy and then like you medication to stop the oestrogen production. Mine was HER negative which means that it is not genetic. There doesnt seem any rhyme nor reason to why this happens but I was very lucky as I didnt know it was there and got picked up by the screening unit.  You will be shell shocked at the moment it is a lot to take in but you will be in the best of hands with the breast care team and they will support you every step of the way. My one piece of advice to you is to stay OFF google its scarey and as I have discovered each and every one of us is different. Good luck and happy to chat if you want too. xx",

I don't know what to say to offer re assurance except to say that no-one knows what it is yet and it could be many things listen to your rational brain if you can. Its not easy and you will be worried and weepy and all that is perfectly ok its scarey waiting and then going to see people and finding out what it is but you are going to be seen in the right place by the right people and people are here on the forum for you to talk with if you dont want to talk to family. The other thing to remember on top of this is your nan and how unwell she has been and how well you have cared for her. Its  a hard time for you at the moment but keep your chin up and take a day at a time if you can . ",

You cry if you want to and shout at the world if you want to. You are entitled to have your off days when you are not feeling so good and feeling sorry or your self allow yourself some time and space and take each day as it comes and be kind to yourself Ossy. Have you got a breast care nurse because they can get you someone to talk with and are there any cancer support groups near you? I didn't think a group would be something I would ever do but I went along to one last week and I am sooo glad I did I felt sooo much better when I came out. Sending big hugs. xx    ",

However, I think you need to talk to this GP face to face ad maybe ask them if you are bothering them as they seem so busy. (tongue in cheek) Hopefully that will make them sit up and take some notice that's shocking whats happening to you. This person needs  a stern talking to about how they are treating patients that's not right at all. You must be a very patient person I would have blown at the point where he answered an email -how rude of him. You deserve better than that. x Can you see another GP? x",

Do you have a link to a breast care nurse if so you need to speak to them urgently. Failing any of that I would write a strongly worded letter of complaint to the CEO of the hospitals involved someone has to be able to answer any questions you have. I can imagine that you will be feeling a whole host of emotions right now and who could blame you with all this going on for you. Hopefully maybe some of the other folks on hear may have some other advice for you and let us know how you get on. xxxxx",

Mine was invasive lobular with no lymph involvement so had my first radiotherapy today and it was ok. I had my lumpectomy in April and wound healing well. It doesn't matter how much you prepare yourself when they say the words breast cancer the world seems to stop. I have managed to keep quite perky but have had so many down days as well and you are allowed those Sharmer. I had a good cry after I came out from my consultant and then got myself together and gave myself a good talking to and said no point crying I need every ounce of energy for what might be in front of me. You will be so shocked and if I have one piece of advice for you its to stay off the internet as I did that and scared the life out of myself.    sending you big hugs and stay strong in the face of what you may have to come and let us all know how you are and how you get on. xxxx",

Tell your mum from me that she musn't give up she will come through the other end it may be a long journey but journey it is and she will get there. It is probably all very overwhelming for her Laura and hopefully she will bounce back before too long. All you can do is be there for her and give plenty of hugs which I am sure that you will be doing.  Hope it all goes well and that your mum feels better soon. x",
