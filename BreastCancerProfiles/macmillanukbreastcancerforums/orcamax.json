    "Content": "Hi Sally, I started my FEC-T cemo on the 17th jan, I need 3 lots of FEC and 3 of Taxotose, next one will be the 7th feb. I noticed yesterday that my hair has started to fall out. Although i read about the cold cap, but decided not to try it. I had shoulder length hair and i got my sister-in-law to cut it to a shortish style. My wig i have is a different colour, i have gone for a brown, but my own hair has blonde highlights in. I have just said to myself , th\\t if anyone asks why my hair is different,(to those who don't know that i have Breast cancer) i just  tell them i wanted a change.... Hope all goes well with your treatment Regards Maxine",
