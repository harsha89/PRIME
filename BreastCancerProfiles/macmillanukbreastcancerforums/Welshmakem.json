      "Content": "Having my last chemo tomorrow my 8th thank god, it's been rough but I've got through it, ive now got my appointment to meet my surgeon and I'm dithering about what to do, I've been advised it will prob be lumpectomy and partial lymph nodes removal, but having her2 positive I'm worried about return of cancer in future even though I've started herceptin and will continue for next year every 3 weeks, has anybody on here opted for mastectomy in single breast or both instead to totally remove any chance of return and aid peace of mind. Is that to dramatic a decision I've read up on pros and cons and can see both arguments, but I'm thinking of double mastectomy cos I'm a worrier and I 'll sleep better I think, anybody have any insight or advice, it would be appreciated Thanks ",

      "Content": "Thanks for reply I have alot to think about don't I? My husband is very supportive of my ultimate decision citing it's my body, he can see pros and cons in both options and so can I but hasn't made the decision any easier, I'll just have to speak to my oncologist on the 15th may ask her advice and see what surgeon says on the 16th Thanks again Pauline",
