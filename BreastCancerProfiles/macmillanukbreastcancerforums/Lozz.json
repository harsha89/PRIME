      "Content": "Hi Optimistic & Batfinkcaz, Thank you so much for your replies.  I guess I will have to wait and see.  Maybe it won't be too bad. Lots of people have said that the surgery is straightforward so I am trying not to be too anxious.  I have never had general anaesthetic before so it is all a big unknown.  I am dreading the thought of being put to sleep then waking up with loads of stitches, pain, etc.  However, perhaps it won't be as bad as I imagine it to be. Best wishes to you both in your treatment. xx",

      "Content": "When you had the operation what clothes did you bring to go home in? I'm assuming that I won't be able to wear jeans! Should I bring a dress???! Also should I buy a nightdress? I currently only have pyjamas but perhaps even they will be uncomfortable.  Lastly I have been told to bring a dressing gown but I only have a onsie! The nurse said don't buy one they will \"double gown me\". What does that mean anyway and will I wish I had my own dressing gown?  I clearly don't have the correct wardrobe for surgery!! ",

      "Content": "Thanks for that.  I'll give it some more thought.  I've a feeling that it would be crazy to buy things for such a short event.  Maybe I should borrow my daughter's dressing gown.  She's just 15 but I can squeeze into it! I hope you remembered to put the sandwich in the bin when you got home and that you didn't find it in your bag a week later.  I'm sure that's what would happen to me!  xx",

      "Content": "Hi I have finally decided to have my ovaries removed after many years of thinking about it/burying my head in the sand. I am very fortunate in that I have not had cancer so far, but I am BRCA2.  There is no ovarian cancer in my family, only breast cancer but my rationale is the following: - it is what the doctors say I should do as my best chance for minimising my risks. - ovarian cancer is not easily detected and  having them removed seems sensible since I have finished having children. - any problems with surgical menopause cannot be worse than ovarian cancer. - my risk of breast cancer is also reduced by having my ovaries removed. I hope that helps and makes sense! Best wishes as you decide xx",
