      "Content": "Hi I had 6 rounds of Docetaxel and was not too bad, actually managed to get into work two weeks out of three, ache like growing pains, and if you have nails you like paint them with a dark nail polish to keep them. Lost my hair everywhere apart from my arms! Keep taking pain relief and ask for Ondansetron for anti sickness I find this much more effective than Metoclopramide. How you react will depend on the dose. This is my second time round and I have been on a larger dose, which as been much harder to deal with, same side effects just stronger. The best advice I can give is wrap yourself up you will feel weak and a little sick but take the tablets and do what you can in small bursts, don't beat yourself up when you feel ill and you will get through it. If your medication does not help tell your doctor/breast care nurse/oncology nurse and they will listen and help. Good luck you will be fine",

      "Content": "Hi does not need to be black just dark, I think it's something to do with light damage, do them yourself or treat yourself your worth it. Have a real pamper somewhere nice, always makes you feel special. Be selfish, there is a time to share and always be caring, but you should never feel guilty about making yourself happy and feel good. You will benefit others more by being happier in yourself. Never worry about things you can do nothing about. Be lovely to yourself.",

      "Content": "Yeah just normal pain relief, if it gets really ache (big bones like growing pains) mix it up a little 2 paracetamol every 4 hours, and 2 ibuprofen every 3 hrs in between the paracetamol. Sorry I did not mention toilet issues, I found I did not visit for no.2's in the first week after chemo, get some good tablets from the doctor, the second week there was no need for tablets, if you get my flow (pun intended). There is no need to put up with any symptom and I wish someone had said this to me first time round. Your not being a pain, or feeling sorry for yourself you just need to feel the best you, so ask everyone for help, if a friend offers to do something for you, bite their hand off, they need to do something positive for themselves as much as you. Hope this helps. Lovely to have someone to do your nails, daughters are the best.",
