      "Content": "Thank you ladies for all your help and suggestions. My GP is good and when I first asked he did try and look it up when I was there and have half a feeling if it came up he would have prescribed it. When I rang back with the details the receptionist was googling it as I was telling her and she said she had found it and would pass details to GP. Can\u2019t help feeling she may have shown GP the web page and he saw the price. Had he not then he may well have just prescribed it. I don\u2019t know why he refused and feel if it was cost he would have said? I already have some Aloe Vera gel and E45 cream from trying to soothe the raging sunburn feeling I had under the arm after sentinel node biopsy So at least I have that. I will look up radiance and see what that says. I also came across something called My Trusty Sunflower Cream which was developed  twenty years ago at Salisbury District Hospital for patients recovering from burns and plastic surgery.  Originally you could only get it in the hospital shop but Now it is sold all over and on Amazon. It\u2019s £6.99 so think I\u2019ll get some of that as well. Don\u2019t mind losing that amount if it doesn\u2019t work. Hopefully I won\u2019t need anything else or not much at all. I was just trying to be prepared. I will still ask advice on Friday at appointment though. You never know they might give me a prescription. Will say my GP said to ask them. Did any of you ladies ring a bell at the end of your radiotherapy or chemo treatment? have a lovely evening all. Frances xxx",

      "Content": "Godd morning everyone. i am due to start radiotherapy soon and was recommended by several people on here to ask GP to prescribe R1 R2. I did ask and GP, he hadn\u2019t heard of it and  couldn\u2019t locate it under just that. He asked me to find more information on it name etc. I did and sent a message to him. Have just had call from surgery to say GP can\u2019t prescribe it/ipant available on prescription. Was told to go back to who advised asking for it and get them to sort it. i have checked it out and various people Have said it is available on the NHS. That was a couple of years ago and wonder if it has been stopped now as it is expensive. Was thinking of buying it privately as it\u2019s suppose to be very good but you are talkI got £70-£80 for both gel and cream. does anyone know where I can get it cheaper please or has anyone had it on prescription recently or is there something else that anyone can recommend please. i am having my preparation consultation and tattoo spots done on Friday. I guess I could ask there and see if they will prescribe or recommend something. thank you all. love and hugs Frances xxx",

Just made a brew and going to watch the video. Think I\u2019ll do a trial run with some DK I have, just to get the idea and then sort some better yarn. I am a bit of a yarn stasher and any excuse to buy more, lol. I have been on Anastrozole for 5 months and finding it ok. Just the odd \u201cwarm\u201d moment and joint discomfort but not all the time and quite tolerable. these last few days my right wrist (I\u2019m a leftie) has swollen a little and is painful at times, but again bearable. More of a nuisance. I am allergic to ibuprofen but will take a paracetamol if needed. What I am wondering is would one of these wrist supports/fingerless stretchy glove things or something similar help. Just thought all you crafty ladies would know or may indeed use them in your crafts just for the support alone. There I no way I\u2019m giving up my crafts so just looking for ideas. Thanks girls.

      "Content": "Morning Ladies. Oh I am a happy bunny to have found this thread/group/link. I love crafting, mainly knitting, crocheting and sewing. Had a passion for cross stitch and spent enormous amount of money on it over the years but just before Christmas I got rid of it all. People don\u2019t like receiving cross stitch pictures or appreciate the hours of work that goes into it. I dont have the wall space to hang any more. Even small cross stitch items are not really wanted. It seemed a shame to have all this cross stitch materials not being put to good use so I gave it all to a vicar friend of mine for his ladies craft group at church.  I live on my own in a village and don\u2019t drive. There isn\u2019t any craft group to join and would love to go to a knit and knitter or stitch and bitch group and be with like minded people.  My latest creations have been 4 large pouffes which I was asked to make for a friends daughter who is getting married in a tepee in October for the guests to sit on. Don\u2019t ask!! Anyway I finished them last night. I agree to make them just before being diagnosed last August and to be honest I didn\u2019t think I would be able to do them as i had just one or two other things on my mind then. Well Im a stubborn so and so and don\u2019t like letting people down and as I was feeling better I got crochet hook out and off I went. Mind you I\u2019m glad they are finished as by the 4th one it was getting pretty boring. My latest project is a knitted dog coat for a charity that my friend linked me too. I would love to knit knitted knockers but the 3 UK groups I\u2019ve seen via link dont seem to be taking volunteers. Maybe I\u2019ll have to knit nose warmer instead Well I have waffled on too long and need a coffee. Just love this thread and so nice to be among like minded crafters with my sense of humour as well. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying about that but you have given me some giggles. Love Frances xxx",

Have to admit it looks very pretty and is an excellent excuse to stay home and just knit, crochet, paint or do whatever your craft is. I was beginning to think this group was no more or people weren\u2019t interested as didn\u2019t see any posts for ages Then I found they had all gone into my junk file. Was lovely reading what you have all been up to and was happy to see the group growing and thriving . I love all your pictures and what a fantastic crafty lot we are. A few have mentioned scraps or leftover yarn and what to do with them or wanting patterns. This link is all free patterns for knitting and crocheted things. Yes they do everything else as well but have masses of free patterns in every category. www.garnstudio.com/.../kategori_oversikt.php I\u2019m knitting dog coats for 2 rescue charities at the moment which is addictive as can make one in an evening. I also bought some lovely soft yarn to make some knockers. I do have a bit of an addiction to stash buying and found a very good site for it, woolwarehouse. My latest order:   Have a warm and happy Sunday all. Love and hugs Frances xxx",

My surgery was last September but still get discomfort and tendernes on both scars. 4 weeks ago I had to have a core biopsy on a swollen lymph node under the arm as it was a cause for concern. Happily it was fat necrosis. Anyway, since then the scar has been even more uncomfortable as they were disturbing the first one. Of course I can\u2019t help prodding it to see if it\u2019s got smaller or gone(slapped wrists) but I\u2019m getting better at not doing so. I had heard that heat can help so I made an underarm wheat bag. I don\u2019t wear it next to skin but on top of T shirt and the strap keeps it nicely in place. Love and hugs Frances xxx top ",

      "Content": "A pleasure to help if I can. Although they are called wheat bags you can fill them with almost anything seed like but the best is either pearl barley or brown rice. Brown rice is better apparently if you want to add an essential oil for an aromatherapy smell as the rice holds the oil better. I used this primarily because I had it in.  I started off drawing a large heart shape on paper and then modifying it by not making it as deep and slightly wider at the top as I wanted it to cup round under the arm comfortably. I used fleece material as as I got Half a yard for £2.50 it didn\u2019t bother me it was tartan. Just make sure it is a fabric that won\u2019t melt in a microwave. If unsure try a small piece. fleece I\u2019ve found is ok and wanted something soft.  First time I kept warming it in 30 second blasts and for about 90 seconds. Realised that was too hot for delicate underarm skin. Next time I just did 30 seconds and even tough it didn\u2019t feel really warm believe me it was for under the arm.  Only put enough rice in to get a flat covering otherwise it is bulky and uncomfortable. It took me 3 goes before I got it right. You can squidgy it into the place you need it but also the fabric holds the heat to and helps. The strap was an afterthought so next time I will do it better. First attempt I had 2 and thought I would tie it at the right level but soon found out you can\u2019t do that on yourself!,.  Hope it helps. hugs Frances xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Gail Thank you for your kind words. I did join the forum at the beginning of my journey but don\u2019t post often. Also since things went wrong and not longer get daily notifications I miss a lot. My BCN still hasn\u2019t rung so I\u2019ll try again tomorrow. This is not the first time she has taken a couple of days to respond but it\u2019s now 3 days. Sadly she doesn\u2019t fill me with confidence. In the past if I have asked anything she just says it\u2019s normal or all part of healing. Never explains or helps. Told to take painkillers and that\u2019s it. When I saw her about the small lump the first thing she said was \u201cI don\u2019t know how you find these things\u201d. Felt a bit guilty. It\u2019s only the second time and both times I was right and not imagining it. Last time it was Fat Necrosis in axilla thank goodness. The sad thing is when I did the Moving Forward Course in January many said how they felt let down by their BCNs. We were finding things out we should have been told during treatment or we found out through our own research or the lovely people on here. Hugs to you Frances xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you. Yes it is nice to know others are being helped having succumbed to this awful disease and news that no one wants to hear. Yes I am reassured but get tired you have to fight to get information you need or questions answered. Thankfully I have a wonderful friend who listens and puts me right if I get a bit unsure. I wish you a very happy Christmas and look forward to a positive, healthy and happy new year. Hugs Frances xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Gail, sorry for late reply but have only just seen this. I did ring my BCN and she eventually called me. She said she had seen my email but had been off sick and only came back Wednesday. This was now Friday afternoon! Anyway I said I take it that a cutaneous lesion means no cancer or tumour. She said yes, there was nothing she, sonographer or radiologist, was worried about. If she was she would have biopsied it. Looked like a little lesion, a little skin cyst (that\u2019s a new one to me), maybe a hair follicle but it was tiny and she wasn\u2019t worried about it. it was nice to know but couldn\u2019t help feeling let down. Active treatment was great and the care and attention I had was second to none. Sadly though from Virtually the day radiotherapy stopped and oncologist discharged me to care of BCNs and GP for next 5 years it\u2019s like we are forgotten about or don\u2019t matter. I hadn\u2019t had the need to call my BCN for 5 months and I had to wait a week to speak to her. Sorry if I sound negative and ungrateful but I have seen and heard this so many times with others feeling the same. There are no local groups of any kind where I live. It\u2019s either call your BCN or go to the drop on centre which is once a week for 2 hours and is an hour and a half away. It\u2019s like going to the doctors and you get about 10 minutes with a nurse. At least though if they think anything needs looking at you are seen straight away usually as it\u2019s in the hospital. Ok, moan over. I am very grateful for the treatment I\u2019ve had and feel lucky it was caught early. Come February I see my surgeon who is going to give me a new nipple. Had to wait a year or so after radiotherapy. I live on my own so no one sees me as nature intended but I\u2019m getting excited to have a nipple and hopefully look the same again. love and hugs Frances xxx",

      "Content": "Evening friends Please excuse me if I am having a senior or thick moment but need to ask. 2 weeks ago I found a very small lump in my affected breast. Was diagnosed last August and had surgery 2 weeks later. 1st year mammo I joined the Neddy club. I went and saw my BCnurse at the drop in session last Thursday. she felt it, thought it might be a cyst but sent me for ultrasound. Lady doing the ultrasound sound said everything looked fine and nothing to worry about. It wasn\u2019t a cyst. She thought it might be a hair follicle. On report she put Cutaneous Lesion. That just means a skin injury. I was a happy bunny, gave her a hug and off I went.  Over the weekend I was thinking about it.  My question is am I right in assuming that saying everything looking fine and nothing to worry about means that no cancer was seen or detected? (obviously at this time). I emailed my BCN nurse Monday night and asked her to call me when she had time as I had some questions. So far she hasn\u2019t rung. I\u2019m quite upset about that as she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s up and it\u2019s now 2 days.  Has anyone else been told results like that? I guess I\u2019m overreacting but once the thoughts there I have to ask.  Many thanks Hugs Frances xxx",

If it is a typo then it\u2019s a bit scary to think it can happen. I\u2019m not concerned for me as all My pathology/histology have been good.  I caught it very early, to the extent that GP, surgeon and BCN have all been surprised I found lump especially as it was barely palpable.  love Frances xxx",

      "Content": "Afternoon  I have just received a copy of the clinic letter sent to my GP after receiving my results. Everything was as expected (which were very good results) but at the bottom I saw NPI 3.16 which hadn't been mentioned when I was told my results. Not knowing what this was I googled it and now understand what it is and how it is made up. What I\u2019m slightly confused about is the 16 in the score. When I used the NPI calculator it come out as 3.2. When I look at statistics they seem to talk in round figures. 3.1, 3.2 etc and not double figures like 16. I know the 16 is because my lump was 8mm and they calculate x 2. I\u2019m wondering if on the calculations 16. = 1.6cm and they round up to 2 and had it been 14 = 1.4cm it rounds down to 1. It\u2019s the only way I can get to single figures?   The other confusion is the covering letter said it said \u201cShe is now on our Open Acess Model for Low to Moderate Risk Breast Cancer Follow Up\u201d. If I have read the NPI right then I am in the low risk and wonder why the letter says low to moderate. Unless it means whether you are low or moderate the open acess is the same.   Thank you to anyone who can help untangle the knickers I have got into a twist trying to work it out.    Love and hugs Frances xxx",
