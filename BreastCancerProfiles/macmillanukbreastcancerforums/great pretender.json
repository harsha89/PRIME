      "Content": "Hello Bchap,  I too suffer from PN in my feet and I was wondering what brand of tamoxifen you are now taking.  I've been on tamoxifen for nearly 4 years and nearly every time my script is filled I get a new brand of drugs. I've been taking the same brand (Wockhardt) this last 6 months and that's how long my feet have been sore.  Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Bchap,  I didn't have chemo so I'm putting all the blame for my neuropathy on tamoxifen (my opinion of course).  I have spoken with the chemist and they are going to get in the Teva brand of tamoxifen for me to try and see if it makes a difference.  I think it will be a matter of trial and error.  It's only my feet that are affected but on a bad day I can hardly walk (and I'm only on my 50s).  I've been suffering the pain since October so I don't know if things will improve with the weather - here's hoping they do.  I think I must teach myself to take every day as it comes - I want immediate relief and I don't think that's going to happen.  I hope the warmer weather improves your hands.",
