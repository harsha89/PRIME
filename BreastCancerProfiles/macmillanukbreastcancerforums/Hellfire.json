    "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with secondary BC. First line of treatment is to put me thru menopause to reduce levels of Oestrogen then onto hormone therapy with Arimidex. I have had my first Zoladex injection - anyone got any advice on what I can expect to happen and the same goes for Arimidex.Â  Any helpful hints would be greatly appreciated. Thanks H x",
