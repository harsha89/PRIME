    "Content": "It's such a shame that so many people find this campaign insensitive, fake, disgusting to name a few words. I am going to be braving the shave this year, not because I'm brave, not for fake publicity but to raise money for what I feel is a very worthy organisation. I see it completely differently. Many of those doing this are affected or have very close family members with cancer and do it to simply pay back the charity that has been there. Shaving a head does not amount to an understanding of how it feels to have cancer nor does it make someone brave. It does however raise awareness of a very small part of cancer and just how awful it is to lose your hair when you have no choice. Agreed it doesn't involve eyebrows/eyelashes etc but for some having their head shaved is enough of a shock to help them understand a terrible side effect of having cancer treatment.Â ",
