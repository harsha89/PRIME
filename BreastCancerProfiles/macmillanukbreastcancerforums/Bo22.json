    "Content": "I found the best distraction was to go away for a mini break. A change of scenery helped to keep my mind busy as did being away from the normal day to day life. Another thing I did was to do a few Macmillan courses when I was on chemo as I didn't have the energy to get up & about too much but having something constructive to do helped with the boredom especially day time tv which is dire.
