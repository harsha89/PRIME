    "Content": "I find these dismissive reactions very sad to hear about. I had these rashes on my hands and underarms on my 3 Tax treatments. It was very itchy and burny. The oncologist didn't know what it was so sent me immediately to the dermatologist who said it came from lowered resistance and gave me Fucidin creme. Two days later it was gone. I must point out that I'm being treated in Switzerland. Happy to say my last FEC will be next week. Hope this helps",
