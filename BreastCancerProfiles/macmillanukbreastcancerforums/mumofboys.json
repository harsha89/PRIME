I didn\u2019t want to appear to be overreacting.  I ignored the BCC for a long time and don\u2019t want to run the risk of doing it again if there is something that needs attention.  I will make a call to the surgery in the morning and request a referral. I will se how that goes.  Thanks again. ",

      "Content": "Hi All, I hope you don\u2019t mind me posting this question. I am wondering about others experiences.  I was at my doctor this week and one thing that I asked her to check was one of my breasts. I have had an itchy nipple for months and I am not sure if I am more aware now but this nipple is considerably larger than my other. She wasn\u2019t concerned as there was no lump. Earlier this year I had a BCC removed (type of skin cancer) and I think I am now more aware of changes to my skin/body.  Should I be worried??? Has anyone had further tests without a lump?  Thanks for reading and any replies! ",

As standard I will get a mammogram in a couple of months but they obviously didn\u2019t feel the need today.  Should I take comfort in this?  Also told if nipple continues to itch in a few months thy may do a biopsy.  Confused :-| ",
