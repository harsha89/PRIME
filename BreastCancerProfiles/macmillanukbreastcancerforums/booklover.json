    "Content": "Hello everyone, I am new to this group.  10 years ago I was diagnosed with acute leukaemia, went through 6 months of chemotherapy, and have been thankfully in remission ever since.  Then, in April this year, I was diagnosed with extensive high-grade DCIS.  I had a lumpectomy in May but the margins were not clear, so I had to have a mastectomy 3 weeks ago.  Since then I have been struggling with constant throbbing in my breast.  I have visited the breast care nurses and my GP - it is definitely not infected and the scar looks really good and is healing very well.  I have a little bit of seroma, which will reabsorb in time.  I have been prescribed stronger painkillers, but so far they are not having any effect on this permanent throbbing.  I am just wondering if this is normal and if anyone has experienced this? I have also been struggling with the arm exercises - everything is so tight - so I have been referred to a physio, which will hopefully help.  All of this is making me feel quite down and pretty low, tearful and emotional.  I assume that this is normal after the shock of a cancer diagnosis and surgery? Many thanks in advance :)",
