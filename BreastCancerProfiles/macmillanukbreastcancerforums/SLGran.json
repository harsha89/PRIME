      "Content": "Hello and thank you everyone for your answers ..  I'm sorry you had a wait also but it's reassuring that others have been in the same position and also your figures are better than the ones I've seen. I'll link here where I found mine http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/20140220-4 Lin you're right, I was very undecided before I found out it might not be effective if I leave it too long and then I wanted it   .. yes we're bonkers!   Jan did they say anything about time delays to you at the time? Lynn that was a long wait too .. so I guess it's possible and doable  .. I have to see my surgeon on Friday and she will assess with the oncologist after that what can be done. Thanks again for your answers and best of luck to you all xx Linda",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, this is my first time here.  I've had my surgery, mastectomy and since then have had infections and now have an abscess which is still open and healing and I was told today it might be another 3 weeks as it's really deep. I'm really worried over the time lapse from op to chemo as there are some worrying figures for it being much less effective over on the  cancer research page. Anyone have any experience of time lapses and how did you get on ? Thanks  Linda",
