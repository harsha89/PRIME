      "Content": "I too am new to this site so forgive me if I do anything wrong!..I too have just had masectomy (last monday)  with axill clearance, I get my test results tommorow for these and start chemo early new year, my moods have been up and down since finding out, Ive been quite on a high today as had my drains removed at long last so felt like i had freedom!..but now im back down again, worrying about tommorow, im a positive person and have tried my hardest throughout but then i keep getting bad news so im getting more scared as the whole thing progresses..I noticed that someone mentioned the cancer gene, I have this and would be happy to speak to anyone who has any questions..Keep smiling ladies, my son made me laugh earlier as he wanted to look at my scar, i was abit reluctant as hes only 5 (very old headed though), and he just sniggered and said \"someones chopped your booby off!\", haha, he keeps me going and keeps me sane too, laughing has definatly been good medicine for me..love to you all x",

      "Content": "i feel your pain, i was diagnosed pretty much the same time as you, had my masectomy and lymph nodes on th 12th dec, im 36 (spooky so far eh?!) haha..i also have a son but he is 5 years old, married..and what your feeling is totally normal, infact i think  any feeling you have at the moment is normal..laughing, crying, blaming somone else, whatever goes and the next day you'll probably be onto another emotion.. Definatly a rollercoaster..My feelings on the surgery part, was it wasnt as bad as i thought, I just wanted rid of my boob and be here for my little one (presume your feeling similar way), and ive feeling lots better already, scars healing nicely, and when i got the results from op, i had 3 cancers in breast and 3 in 15 of the lymph nodes they removed so masectomy was definatly the right way forward, are you having chemo?..Ive got a support group near where i live (espcially for younger people too) but the thought terrifies me, though ive found here has been a great outlet, and its lovely to speak to people who are going through the same thing and find your not going mad !, Like you my friends and family have been great too, ive been positive too but i still have my days where i just cry, worry, feel sorry for myself and i ve just learnt (with advice from my mum and on here) to just have a good cry, and more than likely tommorow you'll be feeling lots better, but dont beat yourself up about it, i think we're allowed our crappy days..if you ever want to chat or ask any questions as i think im probably a few weeks ahead of you, fire away, and all the best of love and luck for your op, you'll soon be home with your beautiful daughter and hubby getting spoilt rotten and with lots of cuddles (on the booby side!!) my sons grasped now not to go near my right hand side, sure your daughter will cotton on too..take care hun xxx",

      "Content": "Ahh im glad your having a good day, many more to come hopefully, and like i say if you have a bad one, dont beat yourself up on it..The 3 our of 15 lymph nodes mean of the 15 lymph nodes they removed only 3 of them were cancerous which is a good thing as i think (dont quote me) this is where they spread?! Its very confusing stuff isnt it?! haha..Ive been wig shopping today, what a bloody minefield that is, but at last I got one at the end of the day so I now feel fantastic and that a weights been lifted off my shoulder..Ive been so stressed over losing my hair (more so than the boob!!) and Im not even a vain person, take my little boy to school with morning hair and everything ha, but I think its important to a woman isnt it..My arm isnt too bad actually, I cant put it totally straight but its getting there, Im using it, my worse pain is like a neuralgia sort of pain in my arm and chest which can be quite painful at times but I dont think thats the norm so hopefully you wont suffer with that..Im bloody shattered most of time too but I think thats the norm too.  And yep, definatly keep in touch its nice to speak to someone going through the same thing, and know your not going mad! Take Care and good luck for Tuesday xx    ",
