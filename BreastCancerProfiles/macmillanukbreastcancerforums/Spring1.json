    "Content": "Hi, i\u2019m 32 and have been recently diagnosed with stage 2 idc, HER2 positive, will meet with oncologist on the 8th May to discuss which chemo regime I\u2019ll have and will receive the sentinel node biopsy results then too. I\u2019m scared, flit between being pragmatic to overwhelmed. Have a 2 and 5 year old. It\u2019s nice, but sad to know others will be going through this at the same time. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve found this group. Gemma x",
