    "Content": "Hi everyone, I hope it's ok to ask a question on behalf of someone else- I have posted this to the relatives board but was directed here. My nan is 83 and was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of breast cancer in early December. She had her mastectomy 6 days later which was 6 days before Christmas. She is doing well physically, but unfortunately it was such a fast growing cancer the tumour was already 3cm at time of diagnosis, was multi-focal and spread to one of the two lymph nodes she had removed. As a precaution she will receive radiotherapy to the remaining lymph nodes and the chest wall, a three week course. Nan is a very fit, proud and normally healthy, independent lady. I think now because everything happened so fast it's now starting to hit her. She is taking amiridex I believe but has also been prescribed calcichews despite being on a high dose calcium tablet she takes weekly for osteoporosis. On Monday Nan began to get some tummy pains and needed to go to the toilet more with some looseness, we saw the pharmacist on Thursday who suggested she take gaviscon. It helps some but Nan's tummy trouble seems to come and go and not really get better. For example, today she was worried about her stomach hurting so she has just eaten some plain toast and rich tea biscuits (not like nan at all!) she is a very slight lady and only weighs 8 stone. So I am concerned about the effect of further weight loss. She is seeing her gp on Wednesday as she needs a repeat prescription and will mention it then. I have read online that calcichews can give you tummy pain and looseness when going to the toilet. I also know nan is very anxious about her radiotherapy, her tummy trouble started before her oncologist visit and then before her bone density scan. We are going on holiday on the 15th and I hate the thought of leaving her when she's not well. Can anyone give any advice? Thanks, Becky",
