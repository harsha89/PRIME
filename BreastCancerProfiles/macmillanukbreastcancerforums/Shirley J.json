      "Content": "I had a biopsy yesterday because calcium deposits, which I'm told are common, were found at mammogram. I am 49. I didn't know until the consent discussion just prior to the procedure that the needle is huge, 11 gauge. It was done in the mammogram machine and so image- guided and electronic. Grateful for the advanced technology, but OUCH it HURTS after local anaesthetic wears off and next day. I wish I had known about the needle size. I was not prepared for this pain. Last night I woke up moaning. I had trouble sleeping, as I couln't switch off. I kept thinking about it. The two nurses and radiologist were great, but they cleverly place you on your side with arm under chin, hand by head, so my arm blocked view of the biopsy needle. It was a bit bizarre, being biopsied by a robot! I took off the compression bandage this morning, and the tape glue is still stuck on skin, and hurt so much pulling on the sensitive thin boob skin. It's probably benign, all for nothing. Will find out in a week, they made an appointment. Fuck pain. Don't want to do this ever again.",

      "Content": "A few days ago I started having pain and clear discharge from one breast. I honestly just assumed it was some kind of weird infection or hormonal thing. I'm 32, not on birth control, no chance of becoming pregnant. After a couple of days I went to urgent care and was surprised that they were extremely concerned about the possibility of cancer. They sent me to an imaginary center for a mammogram and ultrasound, I haven't gotten the complete results of either yet. But during the ultrasound the tech left in the middle and came back with a doctor who scanned a portion of my breast himself. They said I have a large cluster of cysts and called it some thing with a long name, but that it's probably not cancerous as long as I'm not getting bloody discharge. I also have a referral to a breast surgeon I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with. They didn't really rule out cancer since it's apparently weird to have a huge cluster of cysts, but they didn't seem to want a biopsy. I'm really confused about whether I need to still be concerned about this or not or what is even going on? Also my best is still itchy and painful and leaking so wtf? What am I supposed to do?",

      "Content": "My mom died at 43 of breast cancer. At 41 she had a lump. They did a biopsy. It came back negative. At 42 the lump came back. They did another biopsy. Came back cancer. She died the next year.. even after chemo, radiation, and a mastectomy. It was a VERY traumatic year for all of us. I truly believe the first lump was cancerous and they just didn't see it. ANYWAY. My question is when can I start getting mammograms? I am 31 years old. I literally just noticed two pea sized spots on my right breast. They feel hard like little pebbles. One right next to my nipple and the other about 4 inches away. I am sure it's just some sort of cyst or something caused by hormones or something. I don't know. But if I can be getting mammograms early I would like to take advantage of it. Has anyone gotten mammograms at 31? Would UHC cover it? I have breast implants too, does that matter? Any suggestions? (Feel free to pick and choose which question to answer)",
