      "Content": "Thanks for respond JoDec, hope we will be fine. When I read a lot of replayed in this board, i found that a few people care about pathology information report, I mean ER-PR-HER2- Ki-67 and Grade. I think its better to attach all these information at the end of your replay. it make sense to compare and try to find someone near your situation and share. Maybe in the future we will find the managers of this board gives this features to us as a breast cancer patient. Happy to read that! your chemo kills the monster in tumor and nodes. this is GREAT! may I ask you what is the status of your receptors ER/PR? Ki-67? a lot of research said if its positive ER+ may the chemo will not be effect well. and in the same time they said if you have high grade and Ki-67, the chemo will be effects totally and may shrink your tumor to nothing ! Thank you . ",

      "Content": "Thanks ronstar, its helpful replay. Can you tell me please what is the STATUS OF YOUR CANCER? I mean ER/PR and HER2 . according to my doctor, he gave me FEC ×  3 cycles and Taxotere × 3 cycles. A Japaneses research and other research said that the positive ER receptors not working well with chemo. so thats why I am asking myself: Why the doctor gave me FEC-T plane? I feel so worry and bad about that . His answer : because you have node involved ! my positive node also positive ER+ . So NO IDEA how my onco think . I need to trust him but sometimes I am not !",

      "Content": "How are you sisters? hope all of you will be fine forever. First of all, I want to introduce myself in brief. My name is Ekra, Diagnosed by breast cancer in November 2017, ER/PR+ and HER2 Negative ( still not confirmed!) , 49 years old, Stage 2A ( Still not confirmed also), tumor between 2-3 Cm and positive nodes involved by biopsy ( maybe its 2 nodes, not confirm again!), and finally its Grade 3.  My onco told me you should start with chemo first, then we will make sugary to clean the positive nodes. my treatment plan already started with 3 × FEC and 3 × Taxoter . I finished my first FEC infusion before two weeks. The S/Es is tolerated and manageable by treatment pills . I had palpitation in my first day (for less time) and numbness in my hands for 4 days only, I was scare too much when I faced this issues but I am feel good when these side effects gradually decreased.  I just want to ask and share these questions and answers please. is their chances to be nodes clear after finish my 6 cycles chemo? a lot of doctors on internet say YES! the chances is available but no idea how much percentage it works with chemo. Also I discuss the tumor shrinking, I feel my tumor was soft than before ( after 12 days maybe), no idea if the FEC is really works in my body or not. someone said the FEC is working well with TRIPLE-NEGATIVE only . the chances of working well will decrease if you have positive receptors ( ER/PR + ). I have no idea if its correct information or not . in fact, some ladies said the soft tumor is good indications even if the size not shrink, the cell will be died inside .  Did anyone experience the tumor pain after chemo? sometimes I think its from my period time, or from the chemo effects the tumor . no idea!! one more thing, Ki-67 also is a good indication that if its high means the chemo will be effectively to kill the cancer cell. with high Ki-67 and grade 3 the chemo will be more killer to the cells according to my onco and articles on internet . WHO KNOWS!!  hope to find discussion, i am really confused and need to share experiences about previous topics which I talked about. thanks so much . ",
