      "Content": "So sorry to hear the Tax is being horrid. Unfortunatly I had a very rough time with all of my  chemo. It was a pain but I had the Tax changed to a lower dosage and changed from 3 weekly to weekly. It was a lot easier, the side effects nearly dissapeared and apart from the odd rough day I was able to cope with it a lot better whilst  getting back a much better quality of life. I have now finished both my chemo and radiotherepy and have started my herceptin which is a breeze. There really is light at the end of the tunnel and you really will get there. Stay strong xx  ",

      "Content": "Thanks Sue. My 1st scan was fine when I started the herceptin and I was surprised they stopped the treatment but they know best Hopefully after a few more weeks will be able to go back on it. Have had 3 of 12 so far. Like you I felt fine. Finished my chemo in Nov and then my radiotherepy in Jan and bar a couple of hic ups been fine. Think the scan is due to a comment she made when examining me sure its just precautionary :) Have a great easter break Take Care x  ",

      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone else has had to stop herceptin due to heart issues. I am 45 and have been treated for breast and secondary cancer with masectomey chemo radiotherepy and now herceptin. I had my eco gram as usual a few weeks ago and then was called for a further gamma xray but when I saw my oncologist today she told me that due to left ventrical prblems have to stop the herceptin and go onto tablets to try to get it back to normal. Have to take Lisinopril for 2 weeks and see the cardiologist to sort to stop heart failure and then maybe I can start again if we can get it working again. Has anyone else had this and been able to go back to the herceptin as I am a bit worried as the herceptinn raising my % chances quite considerably in being able to contain the cancer for the next possible 24 mths? Many thanks for taking your time to read this :) x",

      "Content": "Hi Fran I had a left side masectomy and 22 node clearance 12 days ago and am seeing my oncologist for the 1st time on Tuesday. I will also be having Fec chemo then radiotherapy which I expect to start in 2 weeks. Of wig buying this week but will be trying the cold cap as well. Reading all the posts on here has helped me with my expectations of what will happen but am still very worried about what the nect few months hold :( . It was interesting to read about the portocath not somethng I have thought about maybe another decision I will have to make though I have always been lucky and had very good veins so we will see. I do hope you are doing well xx    ",
