(am guessing she means will i have a party or something!) i suppose on a plus point she sees me beating it! im signed off work at the mo for my op and general sanity as people just keep asking me how i am and ive started to find it wearing, the people who i am closer to just joke about which is fine, i have a fairly flat chested friend who said its not too bad you'll get used to it :) in ref to my now smaller, well non existant cup size! but that was said in nice way, and is my sense of humour. i find people draining in general at the mo but guess its cos it reminds me im not them anymore and im on a side road at the moment hoping for a turning back onto the main street. cancer brings the analogies (spelt wrong!) out in me!! x",

(not sure if it works like that know it did when i was on maternity a few years back but thats a bit different!) if it does work like that u could use those holiday days for op? there's so much to take on board so its best to do it day by day and week by week (for me anyway), i am also finding when stuff happens i cope alot better than i think im going to! xxx",

(he has mig welder in shed and luckily is fairly hands on when it comes to practical stuff!) i didnt fast before fec but i did limit what i ate and kept to clear liquids (water and aÂ  cup of green tea!) from night before, i think not eating big meals did help and may cut back a bit further for next one, im definately not underweight ;) my husbands work did a collection for me and i have some lovely chocs which i was glad to be able to enjoy a few of yesterday and am also enjoying my tea again! i was due my period at start of fec and im wondering if this made it a bit worse as im usually wiped for 1 day from that. picc line is feeling more comfortable now which im pleased about even with a swift kick it just received from a tantrumming toddler! i have an injection day after for bone marrow too and my temp went up briefly after i had it but not by too much. diary is a good idea and have done one in retrospect so can remember what happened when i go for next one. on a plus side i have wig fitting tomorrow and apparently my prothesis has arrived but ive decided i dont want an extra hospital trip so will collect with next chem, my m and s t shirt bra with comfy looks fine for now. next hurdle is baldness.................only part of me looking forward to that is the one sick of washing my hair but its all part of the purge and will come back. xxx",

      "Content": "thanks yvonne, i had my lumpectomy 3 weeks ago and will be exactly 4 weeks on day of masectomy! cos they had to remove my nipple at that time ive had trouble looking at me now and am at a stage where 6/10 times i'm fairly ok but if i look when tired or low then the tears start. if your pain was managable with all that then thats reassured me (sorry)Â  with this as i wondered if pain would be more as following on from previous surgery, ive got dcis in theÂ  affected breast, i also had invasive but they said the lumpectomy has taken that away, i could have just had a bit more removed but i may have still had to have a mx, also if i did only have a bit taken i would always be wondering if there had been a bit more further back! will have a look at m&s bras, had forgotten its zero vat. think its a good idea to make yourself look, thats what i plan to do.............in a few weeks time anyway! was going to start now but im now preparing for it to go so no point in getting used to it, shame i'd already nickname it arfur! ('half a' boob!) i dont want to come home with drains for probably a bit of an odd reason which is i'd have to sleep on the 'wrong' side of the bed! good advice about the comfy, i wonder if they will let me have 2! xxx",

      "Content": "hi, i had a seroma after my masectomy and didnt get it drained but i did get it checked everytime i thought it got worse. It did go on its own, slowly! i cant remember how long but it must of been about a month. the advise i got was same as you, we wont drain unless necessary due to risk of infection, also it doesnt always work. They told me if it was uncomfortable and i could cope they would leave it, however they also said if it looked like my breast had grown back they would drain it. i think mine only got as big as half a boob, and i 'adjusted' my softie by removing most of its filling :) xx",
