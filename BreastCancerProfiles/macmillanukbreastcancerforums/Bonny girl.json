    "Content": "HiÂ  I started on the Optima trial just over 3 years ago. It was a very hard decision with many heated conversations with my oncologist. I was randomly selected for my biopsy to go to America and then selected to have endocrine treatment only. I found this very hard to accept initially as my mum died of breast cancer and I wanted every treatment there was. Now I\u2019m grateful that I didn\u2019t have to go through all the unpleasantries of the chemo. Who knows if you have ever done the right thing only time will tell but nearly 4 years after my initial surgery I\u2019m ok so far.",
