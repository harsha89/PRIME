No chemo or radiotherapy required as chemo only gave 2% improvement on 5 and 10 year prognosis so just taking Anastrozole. Still have moments where I feel tearful but it's getting less. Your consultant  is correct it is treatable but I can understand all your concerns it is perfectly normal keep in touch xx0",
