      "Content": "Hi Sammy I have great sympathy for you as my first Tax was extremely painful too and I felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my legs and that I wouldn't be able to cope with the next two doses. For the second cycle I was given gabapentin which made the whole experience very different it made the pain totally bareable and It made Tax seem a lot easier than FEC. I had my final Tax yesterday so Please dont think all cycles will be the same the doctors are really good at giving the meds to help so if pregabalin does help(which I am sure it will) ask for gabapentin xxx sending big hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi All My name is Jane and I have been reading your posts and getting comfort from your messages and I felt it was time I introduced myself. I was diagnosed with two tumors in my left breast the largest being 6cm and also a positive result for cancer cells in my lymphnodes I am 42 years old married to a wonderful supportive husband, 5 children at home and I usually work as a fostercarer to newborns, which I have had to stop until treatment is finished. I am having a Mx and lymph clearance on Monday followed by chemo and possibly radiotherapy. Since diagnosis on 18th May I have been on such a rollercoaster ride. I am beginning to get very nervous about Monday and wondered if anyone has any advice after being through it themselves. I have coped with the practical things like which bra and which pj's but emotions aren't as easy to organise. Lots of love and admiration Jane Xxxxxx",
