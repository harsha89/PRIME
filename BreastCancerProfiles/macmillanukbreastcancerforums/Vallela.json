    "Content": "Hi Baxter. I had breast cancer three years ago. I ate normally during the first three treatments with fec. Once I moved in to the docetaxl things changed. The first two to three days were fine then I was plunged into a situation where everything I put in my mouth tastes awful that included water. I could only stomach chicken soup nothing else. This lasted for four to five days then my symptoms disappeared. What you will find is everyone has a different experience. So whatever symptoms present speak to your McMillan nurse or breast cancer care sister. Take care and good luck with your treatment.Â ",
