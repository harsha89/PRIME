    "Content": "Just thought I'd mention the skin and bone clan of which I am one! I was a size 14 and had great muscle tone and was very fit ( a female bouncer has to be) since I've had a major op to remove alot of cancer and 5, coming into 6th chemo on Monday I have dissapeared and cannot gain weight for love nor money. Resting can be a nightmare when you have to lay on bones and can be painful. I understand that it can't be nice for you guys that have put on the weight and seeing your bodies changing, but I wish I could put weight on which would help me alot and I am never going on a diet again,(The Kate Moss look doesn't do me any favours at all!) Just stay strong and be as happy as you can..........Love and hugs from Carol x",
