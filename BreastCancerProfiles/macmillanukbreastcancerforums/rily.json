There is a large range of breast cancer books put together by one of our members Dreamthief and can be found by clicking HERE. You may also find it helpful to join the breast group, where you will get help, support and advice from others with experience of this. There is also a group for younger women here, Breast Cancer for under 50s . Feel free to ask questions in either group.  Hope this helps. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Hi P.J. and welcome to the community. Sorry to read that your husband does not seem to understand what you have been through. Many of us know what it is like when treatment finishes. The treatment itself can wipe you out for a long time afterwards, and the emotional side of things can last a lot longer. Financial strains also have an effect on relationships. It is difficult for others to understand what effects the treatment has on the body. Your husband will himself have gone through a range of emotions and is now trying to brush everything under the carpet thinking everything will go back to normal.  The old normal has gone and we need to adapt to the new norm, and somehow you need to convince your husband of this. Hopefully someone who has had a similar experience will offer some advice. If you need to talk to anyone personally regarding help with financial or other matters, you can always phone the free helpline on 0808 808 0000 (Mon-Fri 9am - 8pm). You will find the experts friendly and helpful. Hope all goes well. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Hi All Boy O boy O boy.  Hello ladies. I never dreamed I would be involved in this group. My cancer is under control and I thought  I could see light at the end of the tunnel. Turns out it was just a man with a torch with more bad news. Just had a late call from my 32 year old daughter in tears. She has had a drink and just decided to let us know she has had a lump in her breast for over a month which appears to be getting bigger .Like all of us, she thought it might go away. Obviously we have convinced her to see a doctor. My daughter is deaf after having meningitis when she was a baby, so she has already had a tough life. She has a beautiful daughter .I really need to swear but I will kick the dog instead (joking) . We know it may be nothing but can anyone tell us what to expect after the first doctors appointment?      ",

I have always coped well with my own cancer, but when it may affect a family member, it is hard to keep emotions under control. I am the dad by the way. I have always been over protective of this daughter because of her hearing problems. She has always coped well and is very strong. To hear her crying is heartbreaking.",
