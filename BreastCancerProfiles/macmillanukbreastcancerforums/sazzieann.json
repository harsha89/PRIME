    "Content": "Hi Annie  All went well yesterday  back home now and feeling ok just a bit tired and sore.  Got my next appointment for 12 June for results and hopefully plans for  radiotherapy.  Let me know how you get on with your second surgery  and love good luck to  Fissi and everyone going through this. Like you Fissi I have already booked flights to visit my daughters i  Spain in August.  So I am hoping that I will be ok by then but like you Fissi I had already taken out my travel insurance so blow it I am not going to let on - i  any case i am fine!!   Love to you all xxx",
