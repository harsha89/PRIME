    "Content": "  Anyone else experienced the same? Boy do I need answers one way or the other - 5 months of anxiety is eating me up. Have had wheezing/ mild shortness of breath for the last 5 months. Had PET scan (oncologist thought probably lung spread) followed by CT scan (ongologist changed his mind & said likelihood of chest infection but noticed minor lung collapse) then referred me to lung oncologist for expert opinion. Now had chest x-ray, broncoscopy and sample taken. Initial Broncosopy feedback was 'nothing untoward' but oncologist thinks something pressing on lung externally. Again waiting for results and fuller consultation.  ",
