      "Content": "Hi, I wonder whether anyone can help me....I have been on arimidex for 6 years now and am really scared to come off it (my consultant says I could stay on it for another year if I wanted to), but since my lumpectomy and chemo etc, I put on about 3 stone in weight and am desperate to put everything behind me and get my life back on track lol ! Does anyone know anything about arimidex and what happens to your body after you come off it? It scares me that when you come off it your body starts producing oestrogen in your fatty tissue's again and then another lump will appear! But I want to lose weight now and no matter how much I diet or exercise it won't go! I know this probably sounds petty compared to everyone else's problems but if anyone can help by putting my mind at rest that would be great, thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi, just to let you know that I've been on arimidex for 6 years now. My hot flushes were awful and because you can't take \"anything\" conventional I was referred to the NHS Homeopathy Clinic in Bristol. They made up some powders for me and they worked....! I would take one a week for six weeks and then wouldn't have a hot flush for at least six months and then I'd get some more. It was great. I would definately recommend being referred to a homeopathy clinic to anyone.",
