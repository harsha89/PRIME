    "Content": "But if not please point me in the right direction.  Im a breastfeeding mummy with an 10 month old baby. At the end of September I developed a blister like spot on my nipple. All the advice was to feed through it would go. After about 6 weeks I developed terrible shooting pains so I went to the dr. She said my nipple looked infected and gave me a strong course of antibiotics and an appointment to return if it hadn't cleared. The pain has gone, but I still have the spot/wound on my nipple. It's very sore anything touching it irritates it. I have been sent an appointment for the local breast clinic for next week. I'm not sure what to expect, at first I want worried, but now I'm a little bit of a mess. I'm trying to pretend it's fine for my husband. But all I can think about is my little boy. I. Still feeding on the sore side, just once a day. No one has told me I should stop, part of me feels it just needs a break to heal, but. Another part feels it would have got better by now.  Sorry for for the rambling post, I'm not even sure what I want to know. Maybe what I can expect at my appointment?  Many thanks for reading ",
