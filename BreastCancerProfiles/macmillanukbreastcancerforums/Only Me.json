      "Content": "Hi All I was hoping for some advice about post chemo hair regrowth.  I finished FEC 6 weeks ago and the hair on my head is starting to come through at quite an impressive rate but what I was wondering is should I shave off this initial fluffiness as recommended in the Macmillan \"coping with hair loss\" booklet or should I just let it keep growing?  Before chemo I had very fine hair and have been told that my hair could be very different when it grows back, I would love a nice head of thick hair but will be happy with whatever comes through, at the moment it is about 0.5cm and very fluffy and soft. A hairdresser friend said that if I shave of this initial regrowth my hair should become stronger.   Any info would be much appreciated, thanks.  ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies, it's good to know that there are others out there going through same thing.  When my hair started to come out I didn't hesitate to shave it,  I know for many it is extremely traumatic but I've always thought a head of hair is a small price to pay to beat this and tbh I've quite liked being bald but I am excited about having hair again. Like you guys, I too don't really want to get rid of what I now have so think I will persevere with the fluff for time being, starting rads in 2 weeks so maybe by time they are over I'll have enough for a wee trim hehe Keep well all :)",

      "Content": "Thank you all for the replies. Brings a whole new meaning to \"chicken fillets\" Dorothee, haha I mentioned it to radiotherapy team today and I was sent round to see a nurse, she had a wee feel and there was most definitely something there (so not imagining or being paranoid) but she is happy that it is just scar tissue and thinks I may have developed a keloid.   I also found my lump, (I'm 37 so was not of age for routine screening) actually it was the 3rd one I have found in 3 years but other two were not cancerous and was told I just had lumpy boobs but like you I'm not very good at checking, the ones I have found I just happened to \"stumble\" across them in the shower so I guess I am lucky in a way that they have been so noticable but I will make more of an effort now, although I hope none of us need find another lump again. Take care all xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I'm hoping you lovely ladies can help ease my mind, I'm almost finished radiotherapy and it's been ok, really itchy last couple of days but no burns or blisters so on the whole it's all good but tonight while applying my aqueous cream I felt something hard(ish) in the same area as my scar, I now keep going back and touching it to make sure I wasn't imagining it but no I'm not, there is definitely something there! For the past week or 2, my breast seems quite hard and maybe a bit swollen which I have been putting down to the rads but due to this I can't get a proper squish to see what the hard thing is, what I'm wondering is would the scar tissue swell or maybe become inflamed causing this hardness? I had a lumpectomy followed by further clearance in january Thank you in advance for any advice Me xx Keep well",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply, it is reassuring to know that other people have experienced similar things. Think I will give my BCN a call just to check, as you say I'm sure it will not be anything to be concerned about, just didn't think I would get this freaked by feeling a wee hard bit.  Hopefully your mammo results will be all good and you can continue on with some \"normality\" until the next check up. Thanks again xx",
