      "Content": "Hi Elaine I replied to the initial thread as I was in a similar position to you. I'm 45. I empathise with you as its such a difficult decision to make, after all..... Who wants chemo ??!! I was told that if chemo improves outcome by 3% or less its generally not recommended. If it improves prognosis by more than 5%, your told you should have it. It's the boundary between 3% and 5% that's the grey area. You are at the lower end of this scale. It's such a hard, and personal decision. I didn't find it easy at all. I opted for chemo, which was my oncologist recommendation....... I've done 2 sessions and it's hard, but doable. My mums friend (who is a nurse) had a grade 3 lump, and opted not to have chemo. She was 56 at the time. She just celebrated her 5 year anniversary and is very happy with her decision. It's not a \"one size fits all\" solution. The most important thing is that YOU are happy with what you decide. I thought about my family circumstances (I have a disabled son), the support I have now to help me get through this (I'm lucky, I have great family and friends), my health (otherwise good) and how I felt about he possibility of putting my life on hold for 5 months (it hasnt quite come to that!) Please feel free to pm me with any questions you have, I'm not an expert but have been in your shoes You will make the right choice. Sending you virtual hugs, Sarah xxxxx",

I wasn't overweight, non smoker, drank in moderation etc..... I did self exams fairly regularly because I guess I always thought \"why not me?\" thank goodness I did. I knew when something wasn't right, even when the consultant and surgeon couldnt feel anything to worry about. I've had friends who genuinely don't know what to say, and get it wrong.... And others who are seemingly trying to avoid me, which I find really upsettingüò¢ One lady i know (althoigh not well) said \"were you scared when you found out it was cancer?\" duh!!! On the other hand, I've had some real surprises. People who I don't know well actively offering me a lift to hospital, to do housework or just to come and keep me company when I'm down. It's a funny thing, certainly seems to bring out the very best and worst in people we know. Try not to dwell on the comments your friend made, they were insensitive and upsetting....

      "Content": "Hi Carol In answer to your question earlier about whether I had chemo..... Not yet. I have until 6th August to decide. The main reason it is of any benefit to me is my age. I'm 45. After weighing up the pros and cons, I will be having it. I don't know what the protocol is in France, ie do they routinely give chemo even if there is only a potentially tiny benefit, or whether they do tests (like Oncotest dx in USA) which analysis the tumour and gives a much more accurate indication of the need for chemo, before recommending it??? In UK there seems to be clear guideline es as to when it's recommended, and then a category where people are 'borderline' ie small benefit, but not essential and the patient gets to choose..... Like me It's no bad thing, but I think that many countries err on the side of caution and 'overtreat'. Try not to worry, like the other ladies said your outlook looks very positive, its probably a very cautious approach........and if you get the offer of chemo it's just more ammunition you can choose to throw at it!

I was taken off FEC and put on TC for the next 5 doses as as result. The T is Taxatore or Docetaxel! I had my new cocktail last Weds and was given Emend by IV again. I wasn't sick!!! I had the one off injection, which I did myself (I'm fine with needles, just a big baby taking tablets!!!) I was fine until late Friday evening, day 3, when I started to get a bit achy. Saturday wasn't great as I was achy, constipated and very very tearful. But Sunday, day 5 was the worst day by a mile. I ached in bones I never knew I had.... Didn't get out of bed.... Even my teeth hurt!! But the weird thing is, when I woke on Monday the aching had gone! Completely disappeared. I still had vile taste and a blinding headache.... But otherwise felt relatively ok. I have to say, it wasn't a nice experience, but better than FEC for me! Hope ou sail through it with few side effects...... Let us know how you get on. Hugs Sarah xxx",

Then when it did yesterday, I was a sobbing wreck! I expect the red patches are some sort of reaction to the chemicals in your body, bit like the boil that's appeared on my chin this morning - its the size of a bean! The only way you'll know for sure is to talk to the oncologist tomorrow, which I know doesn't help..... In the meantime why don't you give the Mac nurses or your BCN a call as they've a wide experience and will be able to reassure you. As for the chemo not shrinking your lump this time, I expect it has shrunk but as it gets smaller the shrinkage won't be as noticeable to you. 10% shrinkage in a 10cm lump is 1cm...... 10% of a 3cm lump is only 3mm...... Much harder to detect the reduction without a scan. I hate to think of you on your own, upset. Please give the nurses a call and talk to them.

      "Content": "Hi Anita I'm awake too, I has my first chemo yesterday and the steroids wont let my tired body sleepÓÅò I was assured that my lump was normal fiborous tissue, thankfully they did a biopsy to find it was invasive ductal cancer. My lump was 2.1cm and I was lucky that it could be taken away with a wide local excision. I had the choice of chemo because of my age (45) and I opted to have it. Whilst I know I'm lucky to not have to have a mastectomy, I honestly think the surgical procedure is the easiest part, although I do understand the phycologucal impact of losing your breast. Have you talked through all the pros and vows with your BCN, of having chemo first? I guess I'd want to know of there was any way of having a lesser operation if the lump continued to shrink to that extent. It sounds like it's hormone positive, which is a very good sign too.... It's responding to the drugs. I felt in turmoil, until yesterday really. Until I had that needle in my arm and I knew that my treatment was starting, there was always some uncertainty. You will feel better once your decision is made, and you will know it's the right decision for you. There will be others along in the morning with more relevant experience who can share with you, and the helpline is great for factual info. Be armed with all the questions you need answers to an speak to your BCN about your specific situation. You will be fine Sending hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "I had my WLE and SNB on 11th July, results last Thursday (Grade 2, 2.1cm, ER/PR+, HER2 -ve, no nodes involved) I know I need radiotherapy and tamoxifen, but was 'borderline' for Chemo. I was told I had a choice! I guess I should feel lucky that I have a choice as lots of ladies don't, but what a choice to have to make. I've also been asked if I want to take part in a trial for Oncotype DX - its a test used in America which tests your tissue sample against 21 different factors and then asseses how beneficial chemo would be to you. The trial is to establish whether the patient finds the test useful in the decision making process as opposed to whether it is accurate in it's prediction etc (that's already been confirmed in USA) I've¬†spent the entire weekend fretting and worrying about all¬†this. I've been reading up on the side effects of chemo (long and short term), trawling old posts to find out how people have coped with chemo and if anyone else has been in the unenviable position of having to make a 'choice'. I met with the oncologist today to discuss it all. Long and the short of it, the 2 factors which place me in the borderline category are 1) the size of my¬† lump - it was just over the 2cm threshold and¬†2) my age, I'm considered young at 45. Chemo does add benefit to my prognisis over the longer term - statistically anyway, only a few % points, but still a benefit.¬† My gut feel is that I want to throw everything at this I can and don't want to be sat here in X years time, with a reaccurance and thinking that chemo might have made the difference. I've made my decision to¬†have chemo¬†and I will start on FEC at some point in August, irrespective of the Oncotype results - my lovely consultant said I didn't even need to know what they were if I didn't want to. (That was after I broke down in tears...)¬† He finished the meeting by saying that if he was in my position he would be doing the same as me. Strange - I've dreaded chemo since the moment I discovered my 'lump', and tonight for the first time in weeks, I feel calm..................................",

I'd been started on what the onc considered to be the 'best' anti emetics and he was concerned about my reaction. He wanted to see me today to discuss what we do for round 2. He has suggested changing the regime to Docetaxel for the next 5 sessions. Until today, I hadn't realised this was the same thing as Taxotere. Sorry if m a bit slow. I've read such awful things about it, that I was a bit worried. The onc assured me that it wouldn't / couldn't be as bad as what id experienced on FEC. I'm hoping he's right. I do feel a bit reassured finding this thread.... Hope you are all still don't well on it, and fingers crossed I find it just as doable. S xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Annie, So glad you got a 'nice' onc.... It makes all the difference doesn't it? I've found that the one positive of chemo (apart from the fact that it's hopefully killing off any nasties) is that it's taken my mind off the bigger picture for a bit. I find myself in a cycle of being ill, focussing on feeling better, not looking forward to the next chemo, having chemo, being ill etc etc. Every so often I think about the bigger picture and the longer term, and it is scary stuff. I guess I think that there isn't much I can do about my prognosis, but what I can do make sure is that my children remember this time as a positive one, whatever the future may bring. That takes a lot of effort and distracts me, for sure! Try not to dwell on the oncologists words about the results of the scan. I'm sure there is a remote possiblility that the chemo hasn't worked as well as he'd have liked (any thing is possible), but it's probably very, very unlikely... he's just doing his job and dotting all i's and crossing all t's.

I think I've come to the conclusion that it's a journey. Everyone's paths are different and at each junction there's a signpost where we find out a little bit more..... At some point the signpost says 'treatment plan'. Until you get there you're still in limbo and in that horrible place where your worst fears are at the forefront of your mind. I wish I had the magic formula to make the waiting easier.....I kept busy to distract me. It didn't work 100% but I did get there. I'm still waiting on some final results which were due yesterday but delayed..... But they're not as significant as those early stage ones so im a bit calmer.

      "Content": "Hi Christine, I'm sorry I cannot offer any words of wisdom on the effects of FEC........ I have my first dose tomorrow! What I do know is that this whole experience messes with your head..... I too feel that I've dealt with it all well so far, apart from a massive wobble last week when it became apparent my children weren't coping as well as I'd thought they were. But chemo is scaring me. Re sore veins, my oncologist has agreed to me having a Picc line. There wasn't time for me to get it done before tomorrow, but I'll have it done ahead of next time if I have any problems. That's put my mind at rest a bit. I'm sorry you're finding it so hard, it may be a cumulation of everything that's happened as you've been strong for so long. Is there a treat that you can plan just ahead of your next chemo, something to look forward to and take your focus away from the inevitable, I know this works for lots of people. I'm planning on doing it for round 2, as we took the boys to Alton Towers this weekend and it did us all the world of good taking our minds of tomorrow. You will feel better, probably as the day goes on. Hopefully some ladies who are further on in their treatment will be along to reassure you too. Stay strong, big (((hugs))) S xx",

It was obvious he didn't recognise me, as he started asking me questions etc. As I took my top off, and lay down......

I too was in tears Sunday eve. I didn't have tramadol (might ask for some next time) but when I got up on Monday, the pain had almost disappeared. I just had a blinding headache and felt very tired. The only lasting side effect for me, this first time, is tiredness.... But my red blood count is very low so that is probably why. For me docetaxel was better than FEC.... Pain better than continual, uncontrollable vomiting. What a choice to have eh!? üòù S xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Squirrel, welcome to the site, but sorry you have to be here. üòî If you have chemo for BC, you will lose your hair. We all dread this and it is emotional...... but lots of us find its quite liberating. You can get really good wigs and there are some lovely hats and scarves, it won't be as bad as you imagineüòâ Re losing your nails, this will depend on the chemo you have. One of the most common chemos in the UK is FEC. This doesn't seem to affect your nails. Another common chemo, often given after FEC is Taxatore, also know as docetaxel. This is the one that can affect your nails, causing ridges and lifting to the extent that some people lose some nails during or just after chemo. üò£ Like Eider, I've used Evonail and have managed to keep healthy looking nails. Some ladies paint their nails with dark nail varnish, which they say works too. Apparently it is UV light that causes the damage to nails when you're on Tax, so i'd think that acrylic nails might not be a good idea as they are dried under uv light (?)..... I don't really know the answer but your oncologist will be able to tell you, and it is worth asking. If you can keep them it might make you feel a little more like 'you' as you go through the treatment. It will be ok, it is doable..... Let us know how you get on üòä",
