      "Content": "Hi guys me again!! (Sorry)  So I received a letter this morning from my breast ultrasound which was sent to my GP and CC\u2019d to myself.  The radiologist who took a biopsy of my lump has described it as a \u201cindeterminate\u201d lump. I\u2019ve been trying to do some research in regards to this term and I had found that this seems to mean that my lump shows no malignant signs but no benign ones either... which may explain that when I asked for his honest opinion he said to me \u201cit doesn\u2019t look benign, but it doesn\u2019t look like grade 3 cancer either\u201d  Anyway basically I am just wandering if anyone had a \u201cindeterminate lump\u201d and what it turned out to be?? I\u2019m even more confused now and I don\u2019t find out my results until a week Friday!! (February 2nd) I\u2019m driving myself insane. I need to know, I can handle it. I can\u2019t handle the unknown. Thanks guys and sorry again xx",

      "Content": "Hiya. I have posted before but basically I found a lump in my breast a couple of weeks ago. I had an ultrasound and breast biopsy on Tuesday last week. The radiologist said \u201cit doesn\u2019t look benign, but it doesn\u2019t look like grade 3 cancer either\u201d when I asked for his honest opinion. So I\u2019ve been worried ever since. I\u2019ve had a phone call today to say that my follow op appointment with my results will be on Friday 2nd Feb which is over a week away! I was told I should know by the end of this week. Obviously all this waiting around is really stressing me out. I called the hospital back up and asked if my appointment could be bought forward but they told me it couldn\u2019t As that was the only next available appointment with my doctor at the breast clinic as he is the only doctor there. So my question is does this mean it could be good news because they\u2019re leaving me so long? Regardless of what the radiologist said to me at my scan? Or has anyone else with a positive diagnosis had to wait so long from biopsy until their results? Please advice me!!! My head is going to explode! Thanks in advance xx",

I\u2019m thinking because they have made me wait 12 days to come in to get my results I\u2019m thinking \u201cit could be a positive sign as it is urgent\u201d and then on the other foot I\u2019m thinking \u201cthey\u2019re taking their time because they need to discuss treatment going forward\u201d I\u2019m really stressing myself out about all this. The indeterminate phrase has baffled me! Does anyone have an experience with this word themselves?  Xx",
