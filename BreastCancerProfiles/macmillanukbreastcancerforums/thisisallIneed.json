      "Content": " I told the clinic I felt a bit lumpy (if that's a word) on one side so I knew they'd probably call me back to check it out even if the mammogram hadn't shown anything. ﻿I just wanted a bit of reassurance about the number of x-rays. Apparently a tomosynthesis mammogram might give more detail than a standard mammogram. Hopefully the study will help other people in the future so that they don't have to go through the worry of unnecessary call backs. Bless you Annie.",

      "Content": "Hi, This is my first post so please accept my apologies if my question has been answered elsewhere on this forum. I've been recalled to the breast screening clinic because they have detected a abnormality on my mammogram. There is a new method of obtaining 3D images of the breast - Tomosynthesis - and I was sent a consent form to participate in a study using this new x-ray mammography. The 3D mammography will take place at the same time as the standard mammography. I understand that in some cases; radiation can cause cancer so will having the equivalent of two mammograms cause a risk to my health? I'm a bit confused by all this because by my calculations that will mean I will have had a total of three mammograms within two weeks? Any advice will be much appreciated.",
