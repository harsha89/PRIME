My dad ( who's 83) has just had his bowel cancer op and would be highly delighted if he grew back black hair :-) I do feel a bit better now that it probably is just temporary and i guess us ladies can grow long hair to disguise our side burns :-)",

      "Content": "Morning you lovely ladies. Thank you so much for your replies, some of which had me laughing out loud at your descriptions :-)Â  It is a huge relief to me that it seems as if the hairiness is only temporary and that I can live with. It's funny how some days I feel on top of the world, as if no one can touch me, so glad am I to be alive but then others I go into panic mode thinking ' ok cancer when are you coming back?' Do you have the same thoughts and feelings or should I be going to the docs for something to stabalise my thoughts? Oh but there again, having hormone receptive cancer (HER 2) what can you take that won't interfere with the Tamoxifen? Help, I'd better get out of here before I write an epic on my woes and fears.......... Have a good ( or best possible) day Susie x",

      "Content": "Funny you mention CBT Londonbutterfly. I have been fortunate enough to become a volunteer for a lovely lady who is training to be a hypnotherapist. Not the click your fingesr act like a headless chicken type but a form of self hypnosis that channels negativity out of the one part of the brain into the positive part of the brain. I'm one session in out of 7 and have a CD to listen to on an evening to help me sleep. So far I have yet to get to the end of it so something seems to be working. It's a bloomin' pain in the bum to be woken up minutes late with a rampant hot sweat though :-( I think you have hit the nail on the head there, it's all about losing control of your life that causes a lot of anxiety. I need and survive by a routine/deciding what I want to do and with negative thoughts ie when is the cancer coming back? it's very difficult to stay in control. susie xxx",

      "Content": "Help!!!! I'm getting covered in fine downy hair mainly down the sides of my face, from my ears down my cheeks and into my neckline. Although it is very fine it also is very long and I'm extremely conscious of it. Does anyone know what is happening? I have had lumpectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and still on herceptin route until November this year. I have been taking Tamoxifen since April and that seems to be when the hair appeared. I suffer horrendous sweats that I have been putting up with but suddenly spotting this horrible hair has really rocked my world. My self esteem was never great, this really isn't helping me one little bit. I'm hoping one of you lovely people out there will tell me not to worry, it's a temporary thing and it will go. I do appreciate that I have come so far, should count my blessings that I am still alive, that the cancer has been cut away and I truely do but since last September my world is out of my comfort zone and I live from one anxious moment to another. This seems to be another awful thng that I have to deal with. I'm sorry for the whinge, I'm just so fed up :-( susie",
