    "Content": "This post is for anybody just waiting to start chemotherapy.  I took the decision to have my hair shaved off before I started it and I\u2019m so pleased I did. I did it  when I was feeling strong as chemo makes you feel a bit emotional. I lost my hair - the very little I had a few days after my second treatment - It was tiny little bits on my pillow. It was sad but would have been much more traumatic if big lumps had fallen out. I couldn\u2019t recommend it enough to just do it before the chemo takes hold of you - it just makes life so much more bearable. Xx",
