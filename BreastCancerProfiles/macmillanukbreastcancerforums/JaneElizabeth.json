      "Content": "Hi  Got back from the hospital  this afternoon after having fine needle aspiration on 2 cysts and biopsy on the unknown mass in my breast...have to wait 2 weeks for the results. Feeling very sore and pulled about but the Consultant I had was very good.  You find yourself listneing to the key words, 'oh we've at least found it early' meaning you have breast cancer Jane.  They wouldn't say it to me though, I guess I just know. Well I'm prepared to fight again and not allow this C to get me down too much. Hope you didn't mind me sharing this with you.",
