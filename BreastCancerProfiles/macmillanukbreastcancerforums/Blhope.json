Oh well tomorrow is a new day I\u2019m hoping I get the call to go for my ct scan I just want it done now and get my results , anybody on here get the results and it has spread elsewhere ?  Bev xx",

I got told I had breast cancer when I went for my mammogram she knew we could see it , she showed me the four different lumps . I\u2019m 42 by the way .  I\u2019m hoping I get that call tomorrow to go have my ct scan then I will have to wait a few days for the results .  What is lorazepam and do they help ? I do feel like I need go to doctors coz of the worry of it all  hugs  bev xx",
