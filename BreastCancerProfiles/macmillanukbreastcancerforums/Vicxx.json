    "Content": "I had a single mastectomy 18 months ago and am currently on waiting list for DIEP reconstruction. I love wearing strapless and camisole tops so have bought the Barbara strapless bra by Amoena. It comes in black and flesh colour.  It\u2019s ok, not as comfortable as my previous bras because it\u2019s quite moulded. In fact on holiday last year, I realised when I was out that I\u2019d forgotten to put my prosthesis in and you couldn\u2019t even tell! It\u2019s worth ordering one and trying it out. I can\u2019t wait to be able to wear normal bras again though I have to say. ",
