    "Content": "Hi, I have posted this already in the under 50s group but it was suggested I might have more luck here in the main group.  I had FEC and am now having weekly taxol and have just had my 11th dose (just one more!). I had the treatment a couple of days ago and since then have had really sensitive teeth, anything sweet, cold, hot etc is really painful on all four sets of back teeth. I just wondered if anyone else had this and if so if there was anything to help it (other than just avoiding all food that's not lukewarm mashed potato :p). ",
