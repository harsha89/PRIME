Onco said they don't use it, GP said it us not on her list and needs a consultant to tell her to put it on, breast care nurse said she would never go over oncos head. So looks like if I want it I will have to pay for it. Not fair me thinks, only one more person to ask and that is radiotherapist but don't think I will get much joy from him if all the others have said no. Stay strong ladies",

I used to think I would never feel normal again, in a way I don't, I have a new normal now. On 9th April I will be 1 year on from my last Doxetaxol. There were times when I thought I could not do it but this site and all the lovely people kept me going. I hope you have a good support network with friends and family as that helps. But all in all I think this site was my saviour as we were all going through it together and I got so much advice and support from others.",

My problem was very sore nails while I had chemo.  I managed to keep my nails at a good length the whole time and always wore nail polish.  My chemo nurse told me my nail bed would be damaged from chemo and when I looked closely I had 6 very deep ridges in my nails one for each chemo I had. This did not cause a problem until after as the first ridge started to reach the tip of my nail bed, it would seem my nails were very soft around the ridges and one of them came off almost completely. 1 year on all the ridges have grown out and I have healthy nails again.",

I am having some success with the cream, before I felt like I had concrete in my chest, it now feels a little lighter and not so restrictive. I am not waking in the night to turn over any more.

I think you should talk to your doctor about changing medication as the side effects are far to great for you to have quality of life.   Perhaps get a second opinion , perhaps an alternative therapy would be more beneficial.  You need support and your GP should be able to give you an honest overview and point you in the right direction for the help you need.

As my oncologist said to me, if you have a problem call the breast care nurse and she will get you in to see us, she said she could see me once a month but the chances of her picking anything up in clinic is very slim as most things are picked up by the person who then makes a appointment. Same with scans a scan is only good for the day you have it, as changes can occur the very next day. Be vigilant and don't be afraid to call if you have a problem.  Well done for getting through rads. ",

I have just finished chemo and want to tell you it is hard but she can do it.  Tell mum to listen to the chemo nurses, when they give anti sick meds take them, even if you don't feel sick, it's easier to prevent than it is to treat.  My taste did go funny, for a week or so every cycle I could only eat tomato soup, I used to be a coffee drinker but during chemo I hated it, if I wanted a hot drink I had bovril.  Mum must drink 2ltrs  of water every day to flush the chemo out, I found adding orange or lemon a lot easier, I started drinking 2ltrs a day 3 weeks before chemo started, that way I was already used to it, it can be hard some days. Rest is very important, but try to go to bed and rest not sleep in the chair, that way she will rest properly.

You have to be patient though as getting any length is taking it's time as you have to remember the bit on top of your head is going to need a lot more time to catch up to the bit at the back of your neck. Mine also grew back very uneven, one side so much longer than the other, just needed lots of trims. Good luck",

Once I am home I pur r2 cream on and do not put bra back on, I use r2 cream again after shower and again before I go to bed. I then start again the next day. I am red today but only one more to go so think I have done really well.   I know some ladies struggle with radiotherapy but it has been kind to me so far. I hope it is kind to everyone",

I tried things like hot bovril when I did not like coffee anymore, marmite on toast and rolls when everything else was tasting off. Throughout T my taste went AWOL I think i bought up all the tins of tomato soup from my local shop as it was all I could eat for a while.  Fresh orange juice with lemonade was another. You will end up buying loads of things that you fancy then dont like but dont bin anything as your taste will change again very quickly. Hope you are feeling well. ",

Your husband and family have to endure watching you battle this every day and it will make them feel helpless.  Try not to battle them but let them support you in any way they can. Tell them how much you love them because they sure do love you, and sometimes it can be harder on them to watch you fight. Come on here to have a moan and a cry,  we all do it and you will get so much love and support to keep you going.  You can do this, we can do this,  Stay strong lovely, we all have melt downs.",

My advice would be cut it short and let it fall out as it needs too. Stay strong",

GCSF injections can give you incredible bone ache so I was told to have them at night and if they did cause pain to start a antihistamine called clarityn. Which would help some people. It did not help me so second chemo they gave me lenograstim injections instead of filgrastim which really helped.  The injections are easy to use just pinch your tummy and go in the pinch, does not hurt at all. Stay strong lovely",

If you do feel sick and the meds don't work, call the unit and they will change meds. If you get heartburn or indigestion take something right away, if this is a problem the chemo nurse will give you a once a day tablet.  Don't suffer in silence call the unit. Good luck hun, it is hard but you will get through it, make sure you get lots of help at home as you will be very tired and out of breath and watch out for going from constipated to can't stop in a very short space of time. Stay strong lovely",

I did read the other day that you have to have BP done on your lower arm or leg I believe, my local hospital and hospital where I have chemo and RT take blood pressure straight over picc line, it does not hurt. Thought it was standard practice  Hope you are well",
