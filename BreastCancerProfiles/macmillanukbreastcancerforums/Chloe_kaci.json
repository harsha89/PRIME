      "Content": "You are not being selfish! After everything you are being put through, to enjoy xmas with your family and some normality is understandable. I am facing similar situation. I was expecting surgery week before xmas, and I was in pieces when they told me. The thought of not being with my daughter xmas morning made me so upset. The hospital have been understanding and are happy for me to have the operation between xmas and new year. Only a weeks delay, but will make all the difference for me and my family!",

      "Content": "So, was diagnosed with cancer in right breast back in July (and lymph node to right armpit). Caughted early so tumour was quite small. Start immediately with 6 week cycle of FEC, my last is next week...thank god! All the way through the process I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s small, it\u2019s shrinking so surgery will be lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy.  I met the surgeon a couple of days ago to what I assumed was to confirm a surgery date and he drops to me that the consultants have decided I should now have full mastectomy, and they are advising to both breasts (apparently because Of my you he age - 33). He said I will undergo surgery 3 weeks from finishing chemo, so I\u2019m 4 weeks I facing a full mastectomy yet ive not even had any arrangements made to even speak to a plastic surgeon. Seems like it\u2019s all very last minute to me, should I be chasing this. I don\u2019t even know what type of surgery they have planned! It\u2019s all making me feel very anxious, especially with surgery likely being the week leading up to xmas. I will be so upset not to be with my husband and young daughter for xmas day :-(",

      "Content": "Thanks. I don\u2019t think I want delays, just don\u2019t know why I have had no contact from a plastic surgeon get, so I have time to digest my options? I have come to terms with the fact I will lose one or both breasts, but it\u2019s not know the type of surgery I\u2019m having now making me anxious. I am think of calling the breast unit today to chase up on my referral to a plastic surgeon.",
