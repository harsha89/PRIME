    "Content": "My partner receives her biopsy results today, and after the initial consultation we are expecting the worse. I haven't a clue as to what I can say to her, if its what we fear. I know everything will go straight over her headif it is bad, so can anyone point me in the right direction to what question that I should be asking the consultant on her behalf. Thanks for your time.",
