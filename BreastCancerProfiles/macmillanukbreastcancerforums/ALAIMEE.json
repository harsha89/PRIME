      "Content": "Hello Fiona, I don't post a lot but have read and followed a lot of journeys here and reading your post it was as if I was reading about myself. I am a fair bit down the line and 18 months finished surgery, chemo and radiotherapy treatment, but still have my moments, so don't for a minute think there is anything wrong with how you are feeling. I lost my nails but they came back, I lost my hair and it came back (in fact have ditched the hairdryer and have decided to keep it fairly short), lost weight then piled it on but getting back to my normal weight now, had no energy for so long but have signed up for the Race for Life in June, so hopefully it won't be too long until you start to feel better. Just give yourself time, which I know isn't easy especially as most of us were fully fit and had no health problems before this. My breast care nurse also recommended going on the Moving Forward course which Breast Cancer Care organise, after I finished treatment, as I was constantly ruminating about everything which had happened and also fear of the future. They gave us a really good paper by Dr. Peter Harvey \u201cAfter the Treatment Treatment Finishes \u2013 Then What?\u201d . I felt the majority of what was in the paper applied to me and how I was feeling was pretty normal after what we have been through. It's available on-line. I am now in a much better place, but as I've said, still have my moments!    Evelyn x",

      "Content": "Hi Bridgits-21 I also had arm and shoulder problems after radiotherapy.  My breast care nurse organised physiotherapy for me and I was given gentle exercises which helped me increase the range of motion where I can now hang out my washing and wash my hair, which was a struggle before. The physio did say I would probably have to do the exercises continually to stop my arm seizing up again.  Not sure how that would work with your EDS though.  She also advised firm pressure when moisturising over the area where my lumpectomy  and lymph node biopsy scars are to stop scar tissue forming. It's helped me. Hope you manage to get something sorted. ",

It was the only hot drink that had a taste. I liked soda water and lime as well on the cold drink side. I used to devour Mini Cheddars, swapping between BBQ and cheese flavours. Liked strawberry jelly, minestrone and tomato soups as well.    ",

      "Content": "Hi Helsbels, Before my first chemo I was all ready to go back to work weeks 2 and 3 of each cycle but found it took me to the end of week 2 to fully recover. Week 3 I used as a bit of \u201cme\u201d time to stock up the freezer for weeks 1 and 2 when I had no energy, housework, seeing friends, and getting a bit of exercise outside of the house. I live on my own and needed that time to do a bit of catching up. You should have some time to yourself. I had a very supportive GP who told me bluntly when I developed thrush and an eye infection during radiotherapy that my body was telling me I was not fit to go back to work and to take it easy (I had actually gone to get signed off to go back to work as felt so much better after the chemo, found radiotherapy so much easier). I also work in the NHS with a very supportive line manager .who actually over ruled occupational health and extended my phased return as she felt it was too short. I was lucky in that I was assured my job was safe. I managed to get back to work just three weeks after my pay was cut to half. Take care and look after yourself, you are going through a tough time and work will be there when you are ready to return. Wishing you well.",

      "Content": "Hi Blipandme I too live alone and I think it will be a case of wait and see how you get on after you have your treatment.   The first three chemo sessions (FEC) for me I got through just feeling really tired (at one stage didn't have the energy to get up and put the kettle on when a friend came to visit) and gradually getting better over the following two weeks.  Week three was the week I stocked up on the shopping and batch cooking so the freezer was full for the next session.   Lots of friends and family offered to help, but like you I am a very independent person and the standard answer was \" I'm fine\".    The last three chemo sessions (T) I had quite a hard time and I had to accept lifts to appointments during the first  week and help around the house.   It wasn't easy.    Looking back I now wish instead of putting people off coming round to visit when I felt unwell, I realise now that when friends and family did come I felt better and could forget for a wee while the side effects  and tiredness, even in week 1 of each session.   Do what you can, but don't think you are letting yourself down by asking for help, it can be tough.   Good luck on Tuesday, hope all goes well for you.    ",
