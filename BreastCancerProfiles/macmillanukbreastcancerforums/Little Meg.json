      "Content": "Hi Sally, I completely understand your experience of a painful scalp. I had it really badly for the majority of the FEC treatment. As others have said, it'll deminish hugely when the hair has come out. If I'd known it earlier, I'd have actively helped it come out in hindsight!! Looosing my hair was hard, but it was an immense relief when it was gone. No more itching, vacuming 3 times a day and much less pain.  The only thing I found helped it was a prescription of amatriptyline. This is actually an anti - anxiety tablet, which is taken at night and causes some drowsiness - which also helped me sleep. Sleeping whilst I had the head pain was very difficult. I was prescribed it by a doctor on the chemo ward. I was told by the doctor that there isn't really a recommended medication for nerve pain, but sometimes people find amatriptyline helps. Most over counter analgesic meds won't work as they work in a different way.  I had a 2 week supply which got me through the worst patch. I hope this helps and that it improves soon. Meg   P.S. the bag of frozen peas made me chuckle!!",

      "Content": "Hiya, I'm hoping to talk to someone who's experienced or is experiencing severe joint pain and stiffness following chemo. I finished chemo several months ago and experienced almost no joint problems whilst having it. But began to get it around the time of my mastectomy surgery, which happened a few weeks later. This has gradually got worse and worse over the weeks and months. I am now in severe discomfort and pain much of the time: - My husband has to help me to sit up in bed in the morning as I can't bend or straighten any of my limbs without intense pain, this gradually improves over the first few hours of the day. - I take stairs a step at a time, pausing a moment between each, regardless of when in the day it is and how mobile I've been. - Walking is slow at best  and I shuffle in the morning, when it's at it's worst. - I've discomfort / stiffness / pain in all of my joints which is made worse if I exert myself i.e. If I do any repeated bending, my back will feel worse than usual later that day and next morning. - It wakes me at night. Turning is a nightmare! - I also have a weaker grip in my hands now. - Going from sitting to standing or vice - versa is painful and difficult, kneeling is almost impossible and if I need to, I need to lean on something to push myself back up. Sometimes I can't get myself up without the help of someone. - I currently have the loan of a wheelchair for covering distance or where speed is necessary. What is the cause of this? How long can I expect this to continue? What can I do to improve things? - My GP did a test to check if I'm going into an early menopause as this can cause some joint pain - I was in normal range, though I have had facial flushing, dryness and no period for months. My BCN thinks I'm probably in an early menopause but not showing signs clearly yet. My GP has ruled out arthritis. The results came back negative. - I thought it could be due to my Statin medication, taken since January 2011 when I had 3 small strokes, as these did cause some muscle pain especially at the start, but no joint pain until recently. The new meds have made no difference so far. I have a month to trial it and am almost half way through that. - I talked to my Consultant Oncologist, he thinks it's probably caused by the chemo treatment, although he said it's very unusual. Does anyone have a similar experience? I'm really concerned this will get worse in a few weeks, as I'm about to begin hormone therapy - Herceptin, Arimadex and Zoladex. These will definately cause an early menopause and joint pain is a common side - effect! I'll be on some of these new treatments for as long as 5 years. Please help. I'm already taking morphine due to recent surgery, but it's not helping my joints much and I've been advised to request a new pain clinic assessment. What else can I do? Anyone else had this? All I've found to help so far, is using a warm wheat bag on my joints or holding a warm cup of tea in my hands in the morning to get me moving! Thank you for reading this.

      "Content": "Hi Theresa, Thank you so much for replying! I means a lot to me and my husband, who finds it really hard to see me so disabled by this. I agree, it really helps to hear of others experiencing situations similar to myself. In this case it's not only because of the similar symptoms. I notice we are also similar in age and were diagnosed at a similar time. I'm 39 years old. I was diagnosed when I was 38 - October 2010 and began chemo about 3 - 4 weeks later . So your experience of aching joints reflects roughly the same time as when I began with it! Rather interesting I thought. You are the first person I've read about who may be experiencing joint pain for what could be the same thing - probably chemo. I read your reply to my husband and he just nodded the whole way through, saying that's you... that's you! Especially when you mentioned you describing yourself as being like an old women in the mornings!! I actually edited my post message before sending it, as I was worried I may sound too melodramatic, but if I'm honest I would  normally describe myself as looking like a 90 year old with severe arthiritis on getting up in the morning or like I've been beaten up! My Gran is housebound and uses a wheelchair to cover even short distances, however, I am currently more limited in the mornings than she is at 85 years old!!  I finished my chemo around the end on March and had the surgery mid April. The start of joint pains and stiffness began between the end of chemo and the start of surgery. There were about 5 weeks between them. The pain gradually got worse starting with my ankles if I remember right - I put it down to too much gardening at first, as I blitzed so I would be able to use the garden more after surgery.  I used to be so active. Gardening, walking everywhere, going into town on my own... now I have to plan things carefully - how will I get there? how long will it take me to get ready? how long will it take me to walk there? is there a lift? can my husband drop me off at the entrance?... you get the gist I'm sure. Sound familiar?   How bad are you finding it to do your normal activities? Currently my hands  (fingers & wrists), (ankles & toes), neck & shoulders, knees and hips are the worst - which doesn't leave much! Have you found anything that helps relieve it? I find a microwave warmed wheat bag works wonders on my hands and knees, but it does need reheating frequently and I can't take them out with me, for obvious reasons. I'd be very interested to hear what your key worker on the chemo unit says or suggests. Please keep me informed. I'll do the same, if you're interested in keeping in touch regarding this. It was so good to chat with you. Thank you. Meg x",

      "Content": "Hi Give - Me - A - Break! I'm sorry to hear you are experiencing so much joint pain too, like others on this post. It's sad to hear so many of us are struggling, but doesn't it feel better to know others 'out there' understand what it's like!!! I feel like all I do now - a - days is moan about my situation... my health.... the next treatment I'm enduring... This is not the real me and to be honest I'm pretty fed up hearing my own voice!! Does that sound familiar anyone? Before I was diagnosed I hadn't had a day off sick for more than 3 years and since the day I started treatment for BC, I haven't had a day at work!! How life has changed in the past 9 months!! Like you, any time you'd like a chat...moan... or to swap ideas on things that may help, please get in touch with me. I notice from your message that we are similar in age - I'm 39, so it's possible we are also experiencing similar frustrations. I don't know about you, but I used to be pretty active: I did 2 part - time jobs, enjoyed gardening, I went on regular walks over the fields with friends and my husband, I went swimming and into town to meet friends. Now I shuffle about on my worst days. Bad days can be really hard to get through and I find it really helps to have a listening ear. Especially if the other person truely understands how frustrating, limiting, upsetting and isolating this can be! The MST is the morphine type I've also been taking, but like you I don't think they have been any help to my joints. I have gradually found some things that do relieve the aching a bit though: 1) Taking an Ibuprofen after breakfast on my worst days. This was suggested by several of my doctors, my BCN and my Oncologist. It's anti - inflamatory as well as a pain killer and it does take the edge off the pain sometimes.                                   2) Using a Theraflex wrap or similar product - available cheaply over the internet. This can be frozen to use as an icepack or warmed. It can be warmed in boiling water or better still, the microwave. It's reusable and holds warmth at just the right temperature for about 25 minutes. It works wonders in the morning on my hands and knees!! A wheat bag or hot water bottle work too although I think the Theraflex pack is more effective   .                                                                                                3) Short, gentle walks on the flat avoiding inclines, stiles and steps.                          4) Taking Oil of Evening Primrose capsules at the maximum dose available (from a chemist or health food shop and not via a supermarket as the dose of the active ingredient isn't strong enough). I take 1000mg capsules (x2 am, x2 at lunch and x2 eve). My BCN and Oncologist both suggested that I try this to see if it helps. It'll take at least 3 months before I see any improvement, if any at all, but some women find it helpful. Even though it's over the counter medication, you'll need to check it with your doctor first as it doesn't suit being combined with some other meds or people with some health conditions.                                                                             5) Massage, especially with essential oils and warmth. Again I checked this out with my Oncologist first, as it isn't suitable for everyone. I love a hands massage in the morning!!! I just wish I could get this on the NHS!!! Does anyone else have any suggestions on things that have helped? I hope treatment is going well for you Give - Me - A - Break. Meg x                                                                                                                                                              ",

But it gets me down, just like you. I'm not old enough to feel like this and I don't like being so reliant on my husband (lifts, fetching and carrying, unscrewing jam jars and even opening my medicine bottles cos I can't undo the child - proof locks anymore!) Re: my bones, no I didn't. How did you know there was a problem? I didn't come across this. What pain killers do you find work best for you joint - wise? For me, it's my hands and knees are constant. I have 2 jobs. One requires a lot of hands - on activity and good mobility as I work with disabled children. Like you it's no work / no pay (zero hours contract). So I haven't had money from this job since last October. Luckily my other job has good emplyment protection re: sickness absence - 6 months full pay then sick months half pay. I'm on half pay now. If you don't mind me asking, where did you have reconstruction from? Tummy or back? I was going to have the back option, but it's currently on hold as it's not safe for me to have more major surgery at present due to clots in my brain and lungs since starting chemo. I'm dreading having more surgery already!!! Have a nice day. Meg x",

I'll give a go and let you know if I notice an improvement. It's a mixed bessing to hear it's most likely to be the chemo. It means it's nothing serious and should improve over time as my body heals from the trauma of the chemo, but on the other hand I've heard from one person who is still experiencing joint pain and stiffness since chemo and she finished it 3 years ago!!  Many thanks for your help. my husband has just come back from the shops with a bottle of tonic water for me to try. Have a good day. Hope you'll be feeling better soon.   Meg x",

      "Content": "Hi Theresa, Nice to hear how you're doing. Thanks for the message. I'm doing OK thanks. No change to my joints though. If anything they are worse since I started the hormone treatments about 2 weeks ago. I knew it was a possibility and I'm quite sure my joints are now stiffer and more achey. I think I'm going to have to adapt and get used to it. I'm taking the Evening Primrose Oil daily now, but there's is only a slim chance that I'll benefit from it joint - wise, or so I'm told by the BCN, consultant... Getting back to work over the coming months is going to a big challenge. I'm not sure how I'm going to continue my old job - I worked in an office environment as well as in the community, attending meetings, giving presentations etc... and it a policy that staff travel everywhere by bus or walk. I know I may qualify for use of a taxi to do my job now, but given the current financial situation I think the management will be very reluctant indeed to provide this support long - term! I suspect if they feel I can't do the job without this support, they will try to encourage me into an alternative job option within the company. I can't see me returning before mid September though, at the very earliest, so there's still time to see if my mobility improves. I know some hormones side - effects can reduce after the first few months.  Re: your mention about it possibly being caused by a virus, this is an interesting idea, but sadly I think it's very unlikely in my case as it's been going on for so many months now. Do you feel it could be a virus in your case?? It seems no one really knows what's behind it do they? I don't know if it'll be of any interest to you Theresa or others reading this, but I recently read of a sceintific study being done into people who are experiencing joint pain / stiffness after chemo. I fitted all the criteria except for the fact I don't live in the correct area. I found it on one of the reputable cancer websites, although I can't remember which right now, but it may be this one. They are currently looking for  volunteers to take part in it. I'd have deffinately put my name forward if I could have communted to them. I'll look it up and post it asap in case anyone is interested in participating and live in the local area. Hope you're doing OK. Bye for now. Meg x  PS: This is so me, by the way!!! \"The funny thing is sometimes thoughout the day I think everything's eased up and then I get undressed and realise I can't reach behind me to undo my bra or I get in bed and find I can't lay on my shoulders!! If I sit down for 10 mins at any time I walk like an old lady when I get up!\"",

An interesting thought though. Did they give you any idea why you had a vitamin D deficiency? Did it come about because of chemo or did you have problems previously? Vitamin D is made using sunlight, isn't it - did you just not get much time outside due to illness? Just curious really. I'll start off using the tip of drinking tonic water, to see if that helps. If it doesn't I'll mention your thoughts to my Breast Care Nurse. I'm waiting for a new nurse at the moment. My previous BCN was fantastic support and I really miss her advice and support, but hear I'll be able to speak to her replacement in a couple of weeks. Thanks Bas. Meg x",

      "Content": "Hi again Theresa, Re: the bone thing.... thanks for the explanation. My brains a bit like sponge cake since chemo and everything else I'm sorry, it didn't really register what you meant at the time. In answer to it, no I recovered well from the neutropenic stage after each cycle of chemo and had no delays in treatment thankfully. I spoke to a Breast Care Nurse today about a few things and took the opportunity to ask her about my achey joints. The BCN was not the one assigned to my case but she doesn't return to work until next Thursday I think. I called the team manager as she's met me a couple of times, so knows of my circumstances. I wanted to know her thoughts on a few things. I phoned this morning and she phoned back 2 - 3 hours later. The reason I mention this is... I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE STILL WAITING!! When you say you called your Key Worker, is she a BCN too? Do you think should perhaps call her again? Are you sure she's had your message? Could she be off work or is this normal for her? Could you discuss your concerns with an alternative BCN / Key Worker as I have? You shouldn't be expected to wait for this long!! It may not be life and death... but it's hardly supportive to you is it? Your patience amazes me! I have found my BCN's support and advice invaluable and I have never waited more than 24 hours for a responce in 9 months! I sometimes get to speak to my / a BCN straight away, but usually I leave a voice message and get a return call within 4 hours. Anyway I'll stop ranting now and tell you what she said re: the joints!! (Ha ha). She thinks it's much more likely to be as a result of beginning an early menopause, perhaps made worse by chemo, just as the other BCN thought. She suggested I take evening primrose capsules and buy them from a health food shop - not a supermarket. The supermarkets don't do a strong enough dose she said. For any real benefit to be experienced I should take the maximum dose possible. If it's going to help with menopausal symptoms, it'll take at least 6 weeks to show any affect. I'm going to give it a go as I start herceptin next Thursday and I will definately enter an early menopause within a few weeks of this and want to reduce the chance of current joint problems increasing! If there's any chance you could be experiencing menopausal symptoms due to chemo or hormone treatment perhaps it's worth you trying them out too? She also said using Ibuprofen may help to reduce joint inflamation, which I already use and I notice you are already trying. I told her about the suggestion of drinking tonic water and she said it works quite effectively if you get cramps at night, which I don't normally. I did try it twice, but it made me feel so sick I've given the rest to my husband!! How do people drink it out of choice?? Thanks for the tip though Janie. That recon method sounds interesting, by the way! I'd heard of it but it wasn't offered to me though I'm small busted too. How lucky you are to only need the one recon op!! Very fortunate indeed. I've had one op so far to remove the tumour and fit a tissue expander, but need about 5 more over coming months / years and I'm already dreading them! The surgery was the worst point so far for me.

This is the link: http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/trials/trials-search/a-study-joint-muscle-aches-pain-stiffness-women-breast-cancer-jacs The study appears to be still looking for volunteers and runs until November this year. To participate you need to be under one of the following hospitals:          Southampton General, Queen Alexandra Cosham, Winchester or Eastleigh Healthcare NHS Trust. The research covers the following areas:                                                           Cardiff, Llantrisant, Methyr Tydfil, Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchester. Volunteers should have early stage breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), where the cancer has not spread. Research is to look at women who have experienced joint pain or stiffness caused by chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Thought this may be of interest to some of you. To get involved it looks like you have to organise it through your consultant. It'll be interesting to hear what their results show!! Meg  ",

      "Content": "Morning Theresa, I had my last chemo session on 10th March. I had thin, patchy growth of approximately 1/2 cm with strong roots by the week of 9th May - 9 weeks later, which was when I finally felt confident enough to do without my scarves and began wearing the new look to my hospital appointments and felt happy about being seen by those I know well. I finally had enough hair to have my first hair cut and style on 8th July!! I was desperate for a tidy - up by then as it was growing unevenly. The 'mohican strip', as I call it because it runs from front to back down the centre of my head, was thickest and getting really curly. The sides were thinner and looking a little moth eaten still as were growing more slowly. My hairdresser did a fantastic job of tidying it and balancing the look. She layered the sides, shaved the nape of my neck with a razor comb, thinned the strip and feathered the fringe. I now have a pixie look which I can honestly say I love!! ( Even though since chemo I've got darker, curlier and much greyer hair!!!) I've had lots of compliments about my new image and will definately keep the look for some time - I even had a great compliment from a man who was a complete stranger whilst shopping with my Mum. It was the first time I'd gone without a scarf. He didn't believe me when I thanked him but explained it was in fact 'chemo look'!! (He was very attractive, somewhat younger than myself, so quite a confidence booster as you can imagine. He was so impressed by the look which he actually described as \"really striking\", that he suggested my Mum should get the same hair do - not sure she found it quite as much of a compliment - ha ha!!) I now use my scarves to disguise my 'deflated boob'! I have a tissue expander on the left and a natural breast on the right. I'm unable to start the saline fill due to breathing problems, so if I'm not wearing a cardigan I'll wear a scarf over my shoulder covering my left breast. I chose a colour which co - ordinates with what I'm wearing so it doesn't draw attention to the abnormality when I'm out in public, as I feel it causes staring from people at times. Meg x PS my eye lashes are the best and thickest I've possibly ever had too!! Thicker hair all over",

Mine is courser, curlier, darker but also much greyer!! I'm used to it now, but it was very strange not recognising myself in the mirror for while  - almost as weird as seeing myself bald actually.

      "Content": "Hi Allison, How much worse the situation must be for you, to be so far from family and friends, living and being treated in Germany and with little grasp of the language! Can't they provide a translater in your appointments? The way you describe your mobility difficulties sounds so similar to myself! In the last 2 days I've noticed my hands and knees are becomming a little bit worse too. I've now started the hormone treatments. I had my first Zoladex injection last Wednesday and started the Arimadex tablet the following day. Then on Thursday of this week I had my first Herceptin IV. I've had lots of the other side effects too, but the joint pain and stiffness is really worrying me. Meg x PS No Jane, it seems there are people on here who've had TAC and EC as well as FEC like myself. Stiffness and joint pains seem to affect a lot of people though.",
