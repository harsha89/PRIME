      "Content": "Hey. I don't know all the drugs she's been given ,  to tell you the truth I'm still having trouble processing and understanding it all, I feel that everyday there is something new wrong , I went to her first chemo with her on Friday all was ok as ok can be then they had to stop her 5FU as it increased her heart rate and had to skip it. She was alright when we left the hospital. when we got home in the space of about half hour I just watched her change I just wasnt ready for it I don't think anyone will be ready for it when u first see it. So for the nxt few days she couldn't eat or drink even water as soon as she sipped it would come back up again , she had the anti sickness pill but it had little affect it just kept her awake ( side effect) on the second day her ma called out the doc and he injected her with the anti sickness and luckily it helped, it took like most of the day but she was able to some toast and water. I spoke to her today she is now drinking water with ginger and toast. I can't tell my friends or family how I feel because I'm ment to be the strong one the so called knight in shinning armour battling the so called monster of negative and doubt all I hear is everyone saying \" you gotta be strong for her\" don't get me wrong every time she talks to me I make her smile and laugh and tell her to roll your sleeves up and get on with it, then she smiles at me and says it's crazy how positive you are all the time that's when I just grit my teeth smile and nod .  I'm sorry I don't mean to scare people with this message but I feel like I got tell people who are gonna be or are in the same position as me so you get that micro gram of preparedness that will in a weird way help. ppl say I'm a tough man and show little emotion but as I write this on the bus on the way to work I have tears in my ears biting my lips trying to keep this in ",

      "Content": "Hey all thanks alot for that I reed all your messages to be honest I didn't think anybody would care to reed and answer them as all of you have your own problems and treatments and lives to see to.  I'm embarrassed to say I don't know all her meds that she is on I'm afraid to ask her because I think she expects me to know already. But I know I gotta man up and just ask. We arn't married we have been together a year and we are very close, I agree with what you say this type of thing brings u closer together. sara has moved in with her ma and dad which I told her was her best choice and her ma is amazing looking after her , I don't how  her dad feels and how he's taking it . She had her fist chemo 3 days ago and had surgery to have the cancer removed and her nods too about 5 weeks ago . I know some of u must be thinking whats he whinging about he's only been with her a year but like I said she and I are very very close we both became friends first and built from there . ",
