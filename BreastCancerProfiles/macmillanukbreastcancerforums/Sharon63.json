      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this lovely club. Diagnosed with BC just before Easter and I still don't think it has sunk in. I had surgery within days and the results are quite encouraging - I am told it is not in the lymphs or blood and is a grade 1.I am now waiting for radiotherapy then tamoxifen if i am allowed to take it. My biggest problem is, I am just not sure how I am supposed to feel now. In fact I don't know how I feel. Obviously my results are better than a lot of people but I am afraid of being too optimistic - this horrid disease has a nasty habit of turning round and biting you when you least expect it ! Can anybody give any advice ? Many thanks Sharon",

      "Content": "Can I just leave one genuine heart felt'Thank you' to all who replied to my post, offering me words of comfort despite your own troubles some far worse than my own. Though surrounded by caring people at home, I have never felt so lonely and isolated as I have done recently after my diagnosis. Your replies were of immeasurable help and support. This is not a club I would have wished to join but I feel priviledged and humbled to be amongst you. Not one word of patronisation - This is such a special club, filled with special people - You. Thank you Sharon x",
