      "Content": "Hi. I finished fec-t chemo middle of November and my hair definitely started growing during tax. My daughter took a picture of it in chemo Unit to show me as I didn't really believe her. I didn't lose it all. Had a fine layer all over top of head. I also started herceptin at the same time as tax and was told my hair would regrow slowly until herceptin had finished. I am now 7 weeks post chemo and have short hair growing all over my head but shorter on top. I can still see my scalp. Bit fluffy near the crown and have to use a bit of gel now to stick it down a bit. Chin Hair back with a vengeance and under arm hair just sprouting very fine hair. Didn't lose brows and lashes just went really thin and fine. They still look the same at the moment.  If I don't pay much attention to my hair it is seems to grow quicker lol.i don't wear head covering very often as find it itchy so I often have people wanting to touch my new baby hair as well. I find myself rubbing my hands through it whilst watching TV at night.  It does feel silky soft. You will get there.  Tracey ",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy I am exactly the same with my big toes. Hardly been able to walk or sleep this week. Even bedding to heavy for my poor toes. I was in the middle of radiotherapy  (just finished on Wednesday) Been a struggle to get something on my feet to get there. Have a bad chest infection as well. I thought my toe nails were starting to go ingrown and that was causing the inflammation and pain. After radiotherapy on Wednesday my feet and chest were so bad the radiologist examined me and said the brown toes were definitely caused by docetaxal. I'm on strong antibiotics and steroids. My toes feel much easier today and the infection has popped so pressure released. Seeing GP tomorrow so will ask about ongoing care incase they get bad again. Have lost 1 nail on 3rd toe but no pain with that. If you still have trouble with them you can ask radiologist as they are still oncology doctors.  I haven't repainted them now. Just moisturiser on my dry heals. Good luck Tracey x ",

I am only 11 days past last chemo so thought it was the docetaxal although I haven't had these aches before. Only had 3 herceptin so not sure which side effects are from what. Have planning meeting for radiotherapy on Wednesday and was expecting to feel better by now not worse. Could also be my white blood cells making up again as they were low. I was told the side effects from herceptin were minimal and get better after the first few. Will have a word with the team on Wednesday if no better and see what they say. My 1st herceptin with the home care team is on 9th Dec. 1st one without chemo so hoping to improve. Maybe you could call the team or bcn for advice.  Hope it doesn't last muchi longer Tracey xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. Hope you all had as decent a Christmas as possible. I would like some advice regarding my toes. I am almost 6 weeks post fec-t and my big toe nails are extremely painful at the top edges. I have suffered with them before but usually if I cut the corners off they are ok.  Now they are throbbing all the time. Painful to walk and even the quilt on them hurts in bed. I've lost one nail on another toe but not painful now. My skin is peeling on my heals so using lots of moisturiser. My heals underneath feel bruised if I've been standing or walking for a while. Just soaked my feet and could cry with the pain. Feel I need to get them checked out but not sure whether to go to chiropodist or GP first. Almost wish they would fall off to ease the pain. I think I thought after 3rd week of recovery I would bounce back but am still struggling. I am aching in my back and legs if I've been busy. Still feels like flu.  My tongue still seems to be giving out that horrid taste when I try to eat. I get tired quickly but try to push through it and end up feeling like I'm 80. I have my 5th herceptin on Friday. Could any of these side effects be from that. I hope not as I have 13 more to go. Had 10 radiotherapy so far and will start tamoxifen beginning Jan.  Everyone seems to think I should be fine now and asking if I'm going back to work after Christmas. Want to punch them lol. I have an appointment with my GP on 9th Jan.  Not been to doctors for years so don't know how that will go. Already had 7 months off work and feel really guilty now. Sorry for the long post. Been trying go stay strong and get on with things and hold the tears in for the last few months but getting harder to carry on coping. My husband and family have been brilliant but don't want to keep moaning about everything so try not to say too much. On a lighter note my oven and hob broke whilst cooking Christmas dinner so won't be cooking this week. Lol. Any advice welcome. Thank you Tracey xx",

I had 4 in my left hand (only 1 fec ) The T didn't affect the vein at all. I just kept massaging my forearm and it is improving now. I have herceptin injections in my leg at home now and it's fine. Only takes 5 mins. Then the nurses just sit and chat for 2 hours. I found T very different to fec. Biggest difference being no nausea at all. General achey feeling and wooly head. Never had a temperature but had a couple of nasty chest infections. Good luck with the rest of your treatment but do talk to your onc or nurse re vein pain xx",

I had the blue dye put in on the day of surgery. It does give you a partial blue boob and takes a while to disappear (mine is still quite blue) as they only took 1 node I had no problems with movement pain or lymphoma. I have a small scar low down under armpit and have almost forgotten about it. They will give you some arm exercises but I had full movement almost immediately. Just didn't lift heavy things for a while. The first wee after the operation was very very blue (at first I thought it was blue toilet cleaner lol) in my defence I was still a bit woozy from anesthetic.  The surgeon will explain things to you and the aftercare will be given to you when you are discharged.

My surgeon told me this was the perfect place for a breast reduction and was happy to reduce both at the same surgery.  I too was horrified when I saw the result. Black and blue swollen squashed and misshapen.  I had a big necrosis on my right nipple as well as a blue nipple on the left side from the node biopsy. My family thought my new boobs were great as they were still me and I kept both my nipples as well. That was may this year. They have now settled down really well. No one knows if I have a bra on or not. They are higher up and am still a D cup. Body shape is obviously different especially with weight gain with this chemo but I've almost forgotten I've had them done now. My nipples are still numb but the rest of my scars are small and pink. Takes a while for them to thaw out lol.  Please try and take it one day at a time. Another bonus of the reduction is less back ache.  Hope you have a better day. Take care Tracey xx",

I was dreading having to lie flat on my back with my arms above my head last week. The staff were very good. They told me if I needed to cough then I could, but not to bring my hands down to cover my mouth. They think I have a chest infection now so they have arranged for me to see a doctor at my last session tomorrow. Will also get my feet checked as my big toe nails are very painful swollen and weepy. If you can get yourself there they will assess you. You have a 15 min chat with them before treatment starts or you could ring to see if they can change your start date. Sounds like you need to see a doctor if your cough has lasted a few weeks. Hope you get something sorted. Take care Tracey xx",

I don't like wearing my wig as it's hot and itchy. I don't usually wear anything unless it's freezing then I have some lovely crochet hats my daughter made.

And still got a small amount on top.  Went out like that straight away and am now confident enough to not care what others think. I have a lovely wig which I may wear a bit now it's getting colder and a basket full of hats and scarves  but have hardly worn them in this heat we have had. Good luck and do what is best for you. I felt very empowered. Hope you will too. Tracey xx",

      "Content": "Hi Kim My breast cancer was mixed dcis with ductal and lobular invasive grade 2. As it was all removed with clear margins I don't really dwell on it. I've had chemo and radiotherapy and am now having herceptin 3 weekly for 12 months and tamoxifen for 5 years as the tumor tested positive for her2 protein and oestrogen positive.  They may be testing for her2 as it does take longer for these results you come back. I was told the grade and type of cancer before surgery but didn't know it was invasive until I got the Pathology results afterwards. I think many people have dcis as well as an invasive ductal or lobular so try not to worry about the type. The main thing is that it has all been taken away. Good luck with the rest of your results.   Tracey x",

Struggling with another nasty chest infection now so still feeling rubbish. Radiotherapy doctor was great. Gave me strong antibiotics and steroids which he said should help the infection around my horrid painful brown big toe nails as well. Still have 12 herceptin to go. Doctor recommended not starting my tamoxifen for another week when hopefully my infection has cleared and I can breath better.  Been quite a journey since my first mammogram back in March. Still find it hard to believe this has all happened. Can't wait to get my body back and some sort of normal.  Taking one day at a time really does get you through. Good luck to all you ladies at the beginning of your journey and thank you to the post treatment ladies for all your help. Take care Tracey xx ",

They inject a blue dye which travels to the lymph node so the surgeon knows which one to remove. It was a quick surgery and I was on my way home by 6.30. Bit groggy but nothing like my main surgery to remove the cancer. It left a small scar line just sitting at the top of my bra under my arm. Not actually in the arm pit. No problems healed quickly. Almost forgotten I've had it now except my boob is still a bit blue (surgery was last june) luckily mine was clear so no spread. Just have to be careful lifting heavy things for a while.

Finger nails just don't look pretty nut apart from being tender are still growing well and strong. Finished chemo in November and new part of nails looks OK. Hopefully you will not lose them.

I was told that I was classed as peri menopausal as had been on and off with periods for 2 years. I was 50 on diagnosis in April. I had been having regular periods for 3 months leading up to diagnosis. My last one was in July.  Chemo started in August. Haven't had any since so assume ovaries have stopped working. I was told I would take tamoxifen for 5 years by bcn. Then oncologist told me I may change to letrozole after 2/3 years. Will start sometime next week.  just recovering from chest infection so doctors told me to wait a week to recover. Tamoxifen is good for not thinning bone.  Still don't understand why they gave you the choice. Surely they are the experts and we should be guided by them. I would ask a few more questions so you are happy with whichever you decide to take. Good luck x",

My oncologist prescribed Difflam mouthwash as I did have sore tongue and it was great as it didn't sting and was a nice taste when taste buds went awol. You can also use bicarbonate of soda or baking soda. I think it's a quarter teaspoon per glass of water. Hope this helps Tracey x",

      "Content": "You are an inspiration LondonLass.  Thank you. I am thankful for many things. First and formost the NHS. Breast screening surgery chemo rads and ht of which I'm eternally grateful. Never thought it would be such a rollercoaster. New treatment plan at each appointment. Bring it on i said. Let's do this. Let's get rid of the nasties once and for all. I truly believed that this was doable. It was a massive shock but I decided right there and then that I couldn't changed it so I will deal with it. Few down days but mostly positive. After all I'm a wife of 30 years a mum to 2 amazing grown up children and a mamma to 2 beautiful granddaughters. I'm the one who does the \"looking after\" stuff. I had to do it for them. I give thanks everyday for my family. I also thank the NHS for giving me back my husband who suffered a cardiac arrest aged just 49, whilst driving home from work. They kept him alive for me for 2 weeks until he was strong enough to come back to us. He's almost as good as new. I thank you ladies from the bottom of my heart for the help and advice. Almost normalised the situation for me. I also would like to thank my 2 granddaughters for accepting and loving me unconditionally when my long blond hair fell out and they very softly cuddled me and stroked my very sparsely covered head. Aged 2 and 5 this was the most important thing for me.  For 2017 I would like my body to be as well as my mind thinks it is (and be slightly smaller than it is now - thanks steroids lol) Get back to work and some kind of normal.  Go to my sons wedding in May with enough hair to look half decent on the wedding pics. And thank my family and friends for being amazing. Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas and a healthy new year. Tracey xx",

      "Content": "Hi TootsBess. Congratulations for finishing Chemo. I didn't use cold cap do lost most of my hair except a fine layer on top. It stopped coming out after 3rd fec. Started growing during T and have a full head now. (Look like an action man hair cut lol).  Not sure what to say regarding fatigue. 3 weeks is still early days for you. As chemo side effects seem to be accumulative you have to give your body chance to recover. Bloods my still be low as well.  I finished chemo 13 weeks ago and radiotherapy 7 weeks ago and also expected to spring back to previous cancer days. I am still struggling with everyday things. Having herceptin and tamoxifen now so maybe this isn't helping. I can only do half what I used to do before I ache like I've got flu and feel nausea on and off. Don't know how I'm going to cope going back to work.  Someone else further along this road may be able to advise us both. Don't be hard on yourself and listen to your body. Take care  Tracey xx ",

Kept on after treatment for about 3 weeks but now just do it once a day. No problems at all. Skin just went slightly pink then brown. I used aloe Vera gel. Never had anything placed on my chest during treatment though. Just unzipped the gown got zapped then got dressed. Hope it works out well for you xx",

      "Content": "Hi all.  Having 5th chemo this week 2nd T. Side effects for me on 1st Tax have been the same as fec except no nausea.  Mainly pressure in head eyes and ears and really really bad nasty taste constantly in mouth.  Seems like tongue is producing poison especially when I eat. Not much bone pain or tummy problems.  I have noticed I am more breathless now and am much more tired  (even though I only sleep about 6.5 hours each nignt) I seem to need rest more than sleep. When I had my last MRI scan on heart before herceptin started my LVE had dropped. Could this be why I'm more breathless?  Still have a fine layer of hair on top of head. Armpit hair and leg hair just stopped growing. Eye lashes still ok but eyebrows very thin. Nails are still long and strong. Kept them painted and moisture cuticles daily. Have developed a bright red patch of skin on the back of my hand about the size of 10 pence piece. Looks like a burn but is almost numb to touch. Any ideas what this might be. Can't believe no 5 is almost here. Can't wait to feel fit and well again and get rid of this extra weight. This fatigue thing is very debilitating. Definitely not the same as being tired. Trying to keep positive. Managing it most of the time. Hope everyone else is doing ok.  Onwards and upwards Tracey xx",

Glad you haven't suffered to badly.  The taste this is awful I know. Mine doesn't go away at all know. It's a real pain with everything tasting so bad even water and still gaining weight.

I'm ok pottering at home just when I do more than one flight of stairs I'm struggling.  Also dragging extra weight around doesn't help.  Bit of a catch 22. Doing as much as I can and watching what I eat but still gaining weight. Never mind. Only 2 more to go. Tracey xx",

      "Content": "Hi Maria.  I have kept a chemo diary since day one of treatment. I write my temperature each morning and track my side effects and some feelings every day. This helps to look back on when you have each round and see when you are likely to be feeling good or not so good. Makes planning easier as well and I have chemo brain so is also helpful when I can't remember things. I also write my Meds. Down so I know I've taken everything at the write time.  This works for me. Hope everything works out for you.  I found it much easier to deal with once the treatment plan was in place so hopefully you will feel the same. Take care Tracey xx",

      "Content": "Hi Nic. I had a lumpectomy and double breast reduction. My surgeon suggested this would be the best way of removing the cancer and conserving the natural breast. I was an E cup and my cancer was low down near the bra wire in the middle of my breast. He said it was the piece they would remove if I had chosen to have a reduction so I had the same surgery on both sides. I am now a D cup. Your surgeon will give you advice on what is best for you but make a list of the questions you would like to ask. I had my surgery in may and am now almost half way through fec-t. Good luck with your appointment this week. Tracey xx ",

I took my repeat prescription into boots and told them I need the same brand. (Mine is wockhardt). They were very good and put a sticker on the supply they have with my name on so when my prescription is returned from GP I will have the same brand. They told me to remind them each time I take my repeat in and they will make sure I keep the same brand. Maybe worth having a chat with your local pharmacy xx",
