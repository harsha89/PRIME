    "Content": "I've had surgery to remove a breast tumour and an additional extracapsular lymph node Cancer was found in one lymph node.  I need to decide in the next two to three weeks if I want chemo and radiotherapy but can't decide as I feel really conflicted.  One minute I think yes I must and the next I think no.  I have been shown figures on the NHS predict website by the consultant showing just 8 people extra survive after ten years out of 100 if they have the treatment.  But she would still recommend i have both treatments.  It does not say how well the eight extra people are. I watched my mum go through chemo and radio and it was horrendous - she died of the brain tumour anyway and it made her last years horrendous and appointment heavy.  This was 40 years ago though.   I just don't know what to do and don't want to go through the process if it's going to make things worse and may end up giving me more cancer (both treatments are potentially carcinogenic).  Once I' ve made the decision I will bite the bullet but at the moment i feel so confused because it may well help and give me more time.  Oh my and I'm usually so happy! Can anyone shed any light or point me in the right direction please as I am going mad.... thank you ",
