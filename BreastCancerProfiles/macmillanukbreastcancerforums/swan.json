      "Content": "Thanx so much for your kind and uplifting words. They put a genuine smile on my face.ðŸ˜Š I thought that was impossible considering all the brave smiles i have been putting on. it is the summer holidays and any chance of mental peace is when they are out. They are 14,12&11yrs old. So very emotionally draining. luv the pampering idea maybe i do need space to be by myself. Scared if i am alone will be filling that bath with my tears. !!! where did they all come from???? hope ur doing ok would luv to add u as a friend if that is ok. Quite rusty with using the forum. best wishes xxx",
