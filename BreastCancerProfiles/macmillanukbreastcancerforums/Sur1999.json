      "Content": "clover3 Hi, everyone i'm new to this. Writing this on my sisters behalf who was diagnosed with breast cancer back in May, because she as an active her2 she is receiving chemo before surgery and radiotherapy. The chemo she is having is FEC-T which is in two parts each part has three cycles. Tomorrow is her last one of part one, part two starts in three weeks. We have a long way to go. The reason I am sending this post is although we have other sisters and brothers, they have made it quite clear that they don't want to know (they did the same with me when I had cancer three yrs back) and she is divorced, so my point is that it's just us two, and I am struggling to keep her sprits up and to keep her thinking positive,  I think she needs words of encouragement etc from somebody other than me.  Can anyone help please.   All positive message will be gratefully received. Thank you in anticipation.  hi I am new to this also, I had had a lumpectomy in 1999 followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I am still here to tell the tale, if anyone wants to hear about my journey I will gladly share. Good luck to all.xx",
