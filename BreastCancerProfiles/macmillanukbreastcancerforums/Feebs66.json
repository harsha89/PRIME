A week isn't very long so will look forward to getting the results, either way so that I can deal with it. I appreciate your message, thank you very much. Fi x",

      "Content": "Well had my breast clinic appointment this morning. Lump prodded, mammogram amd ultrasound. They said it could be a cyst so drained it, dark red liquid. They then took 3 biopsies and said that the diagnosis is indeterminate. I am now worried again as at least a week more waiting. Feeling very unsettled at the moment. Also said I have 2 enlarged lymph nodes.",
