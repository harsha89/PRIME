      "Content": "Hi Crystaljuju Thanks for your thoughts on this matter.  My main concern was that I had read somewhere that it could be dangerous for someone who has had breast cancer to use one as there was a chance it could move things around the body.  I obviously don't want to be putting myself in any danger.  Was wondering if anyone had actually used one or read anything about it. Kind regards",
