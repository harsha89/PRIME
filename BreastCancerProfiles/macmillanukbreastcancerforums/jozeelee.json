      "Content": "I have recently had a lumpectomy on a 1.5cm grade 1 tumour. The consultant and breast care nurse assured me there would be no, or very little change in the breast as fluid would fill the cavity left by the tumour. However, I have quite significant shrinkage of the breast and apparently can expect more with radiotherapy which is due to start next week. Does anyone else have experience of this?",
