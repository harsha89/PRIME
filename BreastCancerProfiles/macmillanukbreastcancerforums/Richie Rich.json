      "Content": "Hi Sorry to hear about the apathy surrounding your treatment. I am a male and I am recovering from testicular cancer so I can give you the male perspective. Also my sister has survived breast canver. Before she got it she helped out a friend with cancer by looking after her kids during chemo but the father was there watching TV ?*!? I think you are right the only people you can trust are you and your husband. BUT the first port of call is your hubby and he and everyone else need to work around you and not the other way round. If you have a slot for chemo at the hospital you need to keep it so as not to delay treatment and stop someone else getting it.  He needs to be told that he needs to be there for you, if not for childcare for emotional support and helping while you are feeling Icky. If not and the relatives and friends let you down, you will have to pay for help, that idea ought to motivate your husband. If its work related problems he should get some understanding from his employers. If not do tell him that your child does need their mother to survive and failing that burst into tears. Cancer awareness is not universal and depending on the people you get different responses. Some are over keen and others not keen enough. You do find out about people's true colours from cancer, its a bit of a mirror on their souls. Sometimes you may not have wanted to know but you will find out all the same. Keep fighting though for yourself and your child. In amongst the rotters you will find some genuine people. A call to Macmillan might help, if only for some emotional support but if not there is always this forum that might suffice. KEEP THE FAITH ! Cheers Rich        ",
