      "Content": "I am 53 & have been on tamoxifen for nearly 2 months now, having finished my treatment. Almost immediately I was experiencing mild aches, tolerable, and a full hot flushes. On Wednesday, bizarrely, I started to feel the most shocking pain in all my joints/bones. Usually my pain threshold is very high, sailed through all three of my childbirths & was able to control my pain. Had surgery at the end of November last year & coped with no pain relief. The pain is relentless and really impacting on my life. I\u2019ve succumbed to pain relief but it\u2019s not even touching the pain. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the side effects of the medication and with that in mind I am seriously contemplating stopping the medication. Like you, I\u2019m in a dilemma..! ",

      "Content": "Thank you for response.That\u2019s wonderful to hear that your percentage of reoccurring was only 1%, I bet you were thrilled.  I have an appointment this coming Tuesday with the consultant & that is something I will establish more clearly as I am unclear but hopefully will have a better understanding very soon.  I know to some I may sound wreck-less but for me even if my percentage is slightly higher I will look at different approaches other than conventional medicine - what I\u2019m experiencing is horrendous & impacting so much so that I\u2019m struggling to function. It\u2019s no quality of life..! ",
