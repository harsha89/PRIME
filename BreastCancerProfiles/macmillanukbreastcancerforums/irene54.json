I used to write down what i could remember in the morning and tell my sister about them, in the light of day they do not look quite so scarey but they definately stayed in the weired catagory :-)) Fingers crossed for you that they will stop quite soon. all the best irene                            ",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a double mastectomy and have expanders fitted, i am going for my first fill up at the end of this month. I have just started chemo my second one due next week. If i now had to choose i would have left reconstruction until a later date. i have found that the chemo has been attacking all my surgery scars.Saying that, it is not unbareable. I suppose it depends on how much pain /discomfort you can tolorate. There is a woman i know personaly who had a double mastectomy 10 years ago, who did not plan on having reconstruction, but had it done last year and she is really happy with the results. Hope this helps irene",

I would be surprised if this has some thing to do with your lumph node removal, it sounds like and inner ear problem, they can throw you off balance and make you feel sick, unless you are taking some new tablets ? one of the girls has been off work for three weeks with labarinthitis (pretty sure that is not how it is spelt ) which is a problem with the inner ear, geta docs appointment if you can, and ring your breast care nurse if you have one she should be able to put you on the right track. take care Hugs Irene",

You have to choose what you think will be best for you.I just wish some one had told me that the chemo would attack my scars as i hear it is quite a commom side effect.I would not have made the decision i did. Thats what is great about this site you get such a range of opinions. let me know how you get on with your first chemo.How many are you having?, i am doing six, If i have to think about it as a whole i know i can not do six, but i can do one at a time , so i am doing the next one and we will see where we go from there.

Give yourself a little time to think it through and get as much info as you possibly can before you make your decision.  all the best Irene",

      "Content": "Hi to one and all,  i don't often post ,but i do read every thing that comes through. i can only describe my experience and how i deal with it, but if it can be of any help to any one, thats great. I was dianosed with tumors in both breasts in sept last year, needed a full mx on the right but chose to have a double mx as i felt i would get a better looking recon .I quickly learned to take someone with me to all meetings as i could not remember half of what was said.It was here that i met my breast consultant and my breast cancer nurse.It was from here that i had to make choices,what type of reconstruction would i like, i opted for chest expanders to be fitted at the same time as i had my mx and once filled and the skin stretched they would be replaced by a gel implant.Or a back flap and implant. I was told that at the same time as my op they would remove two lymph nodes from under each arm so they could be tested.But they were sure there was nothing there so it would not be a problem. I stopped work at this time as my concentration was shot to peices and my brain just would not switch off, I had my op on the 11th oct and i stayed in hospital for two days and came home with two drains in, for me the drains were more uncomfortable than the op it's self. This is when my district nurse came into my life and for me one of the most important people.,She wanted to see what was going on under all those plasters and to ensure i had no necrosis. On my next appt i was introduced to my breast reconstruction surgeon and nurse, and had fluid taken off the left and the right hand side.fluid build up was very painful for me and it was bliss when removed, i was then told that they had found cancer in two of my lymph nodes so i was back into hospital for my second op in three weeks. They removed all lymph nodes from my left hand side again i was in hospial for two days and came home with a drain in.Some people stay in hospital longer it just depends on how you are coping and how well you feel. The chest expanders i found reaally very painful, there were some days and nights that they felt so tight i thought i would not be able to get a breath.If you can imagine a belt below and one above your breasts pulled really tight.thats pretty much how it felt. Next i met my oncolagy consultant  and my chemo nurse and  was told i would need fec chemo, 6 courses,but befor i could begin i would need a small op to put in a Groushon line as my veins were not very good. i had my first dose 3 weeks ago and found the first week quite hard although i feel fine now, due my second one on wed. It was about this time that i was begining to feel that i was not coping and getting very stressed.I finally realised that it was because i felt i had lost all control of my life. I had started with a plan and it was changed as new problems arose, i did not expect there to be the pain that there was , i was totaly unprepared for a lot of what i was going through. And this is the problem, treatment seems to vary from place to place, and of course people's lives vary . Now my chest expanders are settling down and much more comfortable and i am dealing with my chemo one treatment at a time. I have given myself the option of stopping if i feel i can not go on, If you are lucky you will be able to have a chat with people i have met here who have been such a help and inspiration, Antsi who has had such a bloody terrible time of it ,but who is here answering concerns in such a cheerfull funny maner that she can grab a smile from even the most miserable of us. And Helen who is on a mission to refurbish her whole  house and nothing is going to stop her also has the tme and the inclination to try and help. As for me i have decided that i can only do one day at a time and only deal with one problem at a time. But i do have choices ,that for me is very important. Today what was left of my hair was a problem, so i cut it off, then shaved my head.:-)) problem solved If i can be of any help to any one do get in touch and i will answer if i can Good thoughts and wishes to you all Irene  ",

So i have no reason to think it will cure me. But what it does mean for me at least is that i can face each new challenge with hope in my heart, and i don't know any one who would deny me this hope. My mother used to say that \"misery likes company\" she died of breast cancer . i miss her very much and i grieve for her loss and i have also grieved for the loss of who i was. I cry when i need to , But i will not wallow in that loss as i really believe that life is for living and for getting as much enjoyment out of it as i can. i wish you well sascha rose Irene",

Yours i am sure will settle down a lot quicker, keep on taking the pain killers and keep up with any physio/exercises that you have been given, you are only two weeks post op and it is a big operation which will have affected all your chest muscles and you will have very deep brusing. be kind to yourself and give yourself time to heal. I found that a bean bag that you can heat in the microwave very helpful laid across my scars the heat soothed it a bit, i also slept propped up on my back in bed ,on a sloped bed rest which i borrowed from my district nurse, it was useful for the first month or so. It also helps to rub cream in every day when your scars are completly healed hopes this helps with some of your questions irene",

Really just let your body tell you what you can and can not do, i tried to lift a bag of manure yesterday and i could not manage it(mind you it was a full bag) had to put up with a 5 minute rant from husband and a sore chest for the rest of the day.

I am not sure if i can give the name out on the site? oh well it is Sheaby nature. It suits me very well and although it seems expensive it does go a long way. Hugs Irene",

And has any one found a decent deoderant that is not full of chemicals. i know since my lymph node removal i only sweat from the other arm, but i still feel i need some thing.The shampoo i have been using is from the sammy range from super drug. many thanks for the info Hugs Irene",

I really do like it but, it has a kind of a smell in the tub which does fade when it is applied. i think we are just so used to perfumed smells that a natural smell , smells odd ! i have learned a lot via this thread so many thanks to all who are contributeting (sorry my spelling is terrible, hugs Irene",

I had my last chemo last week and i am begining to feel like a human being once more. I have no idea who that human being is,  when i look in the mirror i don't recognise myself, no hair, no breasts,no eye brows or lashes and nearly 15 kilos overweight and i bear a strange resemblance to uncle fester from the adams faily. Still i am here and my daughter says i am a work in progress :-) I am so sorry to see so many newbies here, and yet strangely re assured that the worries and problems you are all having is exactly what we all went through when we started. We got through , and you will to.Never doubt that for a moment. I have had lots of support from the site and the people on it, and just wanted to say a big thank you to them all. I will be dropping in from time to time as i still have reconstruction to do and will have to take some sort of meds for five years, but i think i am ready for my life back. When i first started with my cancer treatment some one said to me \" having treatment for cancer is like eating and elephant with a teaspoon. You can only do it one spoon at a time\" and it is so very true. You feel like it is going on forever , and that you will never be done, but you will get there. love and hugs to you all Irene",

I found the expander very painfull,some days it felt like i could hardly draw a breath they were so tight, now 10 weeks on they are still uncomfortable but not all the time.and on the odd occassion i can forget they are there. Non of the fluid i had removed was underneath the expanders and perhaps this is the main problem? i am not sure how they would go about removing fluid from underneath the expander as the last thing you would need is a punctured expander.

I have phoned the oncology unit and i am going in tomorrow to have another blood test done, i am assuming they will make some sort of decision then. Also because i have never had my bloods done mid cycle i have no idea by how much they normally fluctuate. I can see they are dropping month by month and to be honest i was more worried about the posibility of having to have a blood transfusion because of my low red cell count, than this. So when doctor phoned last night it caught me unaware, and again i dont know how low is low? any way we will see what they say tomorrow take care Irene",

I hear you re the constpation though, my regime normally went some thing like this day before chemo after evening meal have some prunes in juice. day of chemo along with lots of water sipped throughout the day, i exchange my cups of tea for warm/hot orange juice the dilute kind, if i have not been to the toilet on chemo day or the next morning  i start movicol which i got from the chemo unit and i will have up to six in one day spaced throughout the day, normally that will do the trick, veg does not work for me so i stck to fruit.  I think i will ring the oncology unit and see what they have to say, be a nightmare if i get sick over the bank holiday weekend. take care Irene",

My Doctor reccomended full removal. I did have a full removal and i wish i could say it has been problem free, i am still seeing the physio for some problems re stiffness and discomfort. But it is a lot better and part of the problem is that i have expanders fitted and they are irritating the muscle that is under the armpit. I have read from others that they have had little or no problem with the lymph removal. The strangest thing is that i now do not sweat under that arm, so i have to remember to put deodorant on the good arm :-)) Hugs irene",

So this is the place to do it, and you normally get replies from those of us who are feeling a little more upbeat and positive on the day, and those of us in the group who are having a day just like you , either don't reply because it may be to difficult. or some can find that they can muster up enough support to try and make you feel a little better and supported. I like you, hate to have to rely on people when i was so used to doing every thing my self. And my frustration levels were very high. Take heart it wil not be long before you are back in the swing of things, so try for the moment to go with the flow and be nice to yourself and give your body time to heal. And when you get really angry let it out, you can scream under a duvet and it does not frighten the neighbours :-) hugs Irene",
