      "Content": "Morning all! Well it seems I have been railroaded into knitting a hat for my friends husband, haven't knitted for years!! I need to find the easiest, fastest growing pattern available.. any suggestions? Big pins, chunky yarn/wool? He wants it for fishing but Iv told him it will be pink! Lol  Day 10 after first EC cycle, feeling like a fraud today, feel so well and getting restless/bored at home already.. hence the hat!  Its been great looking at all your craft skills, you are amazing.  I have so little patience for intricate, fiddly things but I need to fill my time with something..must try harder!! Lol  hugs to everyone x",

      "Content": "Morning! Read your post with interest.  I had my first chemo session yesterday and like you, love my long, curly hair, so insisted on trying the cold cap. I lasted all of 15 mins, cldnt take it any longer!  I applaud you for 2 whole sessions but very sad it hasnt worked for you.  I do know that the thought of having no hair is terrifying to me as an ex hairstylist and just as a woman but it IS only hair, it doesnt define us, and its temporary, hopefully.  Plus side, other areas, no waxing etc for a few months - bonus!!  We got this!!

I was surprised as only radiotherapy and hormone tabs suggested before op, based on results.  Luckily I only have a cat, but he's a semi-long haired \u201cscratchy\u201d cat! Gloves and less grooming for him poor kitty. He will love that!  Wishing you well x",

      "Content": "Hi KT69 Sounds like you are actually doing a great job, seeing mum thru this too..You are allowed to be emotional at times, you just have to let it out! I am in a similar position to you, diagnosis in dec, WLE in Jan, now just had 1st chemo yesterday, 5 more then RT and hormone tabs thereafter.  Out of all of these things, the worst for me was making the decision to have chemo and I actually dealt with this far worse than the actual diagnosis! I cried at anything, the fact that my cat came in with muddy paws after just having steamed the floor made me bawl like a baby... something that would not normally happen...my brain had gone to mush some days too, basic conversations and daily chores were hard work.  We all process things differently, I have learnt that you just have to do what it takes to make this bloody awful \u201cjourney\u201d as do-able and as positive as you can for yourself. Laugh when you get the chance, my partner and I have found the funny in some very serious situations but its what gets us thru. Take care and be kind to yourself x",

Sad note, Ive had to shave my hair off, it was driving me mad getting out of shower feeling dirtier than getting in.. after all of mine and my partners tears over weekend, (me cos of my hair, & him cos he didnt know what to do with me I dont think, lol, Ive hardly cried throughout this thing), I did wonder if I shld have stuck with cold cap.. but I cldnt endure it so no good crying over it now eh?!?  Have got some great scarves, hats and a lovely wig, although my head is too sensitive to wear it still at minute, hoping once the rest of my hair has gone it will calm down a bit. Yeah.. and also a bit dissapointed to see the \u2018ole hairs on my legs are still going strong.. rubbish!!  Sending everyone healing, happy thoughts and gentle hugs x Georgie18",
