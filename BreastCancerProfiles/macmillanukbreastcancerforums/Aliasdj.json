My oncologist is reducing dose by 15% which he says is ok as they set treatment bar high so that it can stand a reduction of up to 20%, so let them know how bad symptoms are they may reduce dosage for you. I hope yours get better soon, big hugs to you.",

      "Content": "Hi Sharmer, like you I was fast racked, I found my lump while I was abroad and had scans and biopsy done before I came home, I was then fast tracked and all rests were redone here, it took approx 4 weeks from first appointment to op, again like you my lump was at 11 o clock it was 22 mm in size and was invasive duct type, there was no evidence of lymphs being affected.  They did take 3 lymphatic for testing at point of operation these were clear, however the surgeon found that the cancer was trying to attack blood vessels. I was opting for reduction rather than reconstruction as I am a 36H cup they took more than I thought but that's ok as the surgeon said he caught it all. I am now waiting for oncology appointment as surgeon says the team have discussed my case and think I need to discuss chemo treatments as this is systemic.  I have had some mega melt downs and from what most people say this is down to anaesthetic try and keep your chin up I have found myself becoming calmer now nearly 3 was from my op still healing. it does get benter, my nurse has been great make sure you let them help. Keep reading this site also because you don't feel so alone knowing there are so many others in similar situations.  Try to stay strong. x  Search",

I had reduction op 3 weeks ago to remove grade 3 tumour that was trying to attacking blood vessels, now waiting for ecology referral, surgeon suggests chemo may be way forward. Wound has become infected and antibiotics causing reaction with chesty cough. I just feel such a fraud by moaning and not dealing with it in my normal way.",
