    "Content": "Hi, I am hoping that i can find other people that are having the same side effects as myself to Femara.I have been taking it for 3 years now and it seems to be getting worse. I am so tired and have no energy at all. My memory is really affected, its embarrasing. I am working and have managed to carry on despite how I feel, but my boss now wants me to do extra hours and i am being pressurised. How can i convince him that these side effects are severe as all the leaflets say may cause some tiredness?",
