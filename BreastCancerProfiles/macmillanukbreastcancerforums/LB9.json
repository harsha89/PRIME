    "Content": "Hi, It\u2019s midnight and I\u2019m tired, but I can\u2019t sleep. I went to my Dr\u2019s 2 days ago and told her about an aching feeling I\u2019ve had in my right breast, under my arm and in my shoulder blade. She examined me and said that she thought my right breast felt slightly more \u2018glandular\u2019, but wanted to refer me to the local breast clinic for further investigation. My Mom, two maternal Aunties and maternal Nan all have BRCA2. Both of my Aunties were diagnosed with breast cancer at 40. One passed away 2 years ago, and my other Auntie has just been diagnosed with Liver Cancer. I\u2019ve not been tested for the gene yet as I\u2019m not quite 30, but with my family history the Dr wanted to make sure all was ok. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it and whether this is it for me :(.Â  Has anyone else had any experience like this? I don\u2019t feel as though I can tell anyone about it as I don\u2019t want to worry anyone, especially with my Auntie being so recently re-diagnosed.",
