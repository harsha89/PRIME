      "Content": "Hi Little Wren You have been given some good advice, and i totally agree that this initial waiting is the worst time. You should be getting your results today and they are usually sure if they tell you they suspect cancer, but whatever you're told you will be well looked after and things will start to move very quickly. You should also be given details of your Specialist Nurse or Key Worker, they are there to support you all through this so speak to them whenever you have any worries (no matter how small).  If you don't have their contact details get in touch with the PALS office (Patient Liaison) at your hospital and ask them to find the contact details for you.  My specialist nurses were a real support to me all through treatment and I can still ring them now if I have any worries or concerns. If your hospital has a Cancer Support Centre do pop in.  They offer lots of help and support.  Mine was really good and I attended art, creative writing and keep fit classes, had counselling and also had six aroma therapy treatments.  I also used to pop in for a cup of tea and a chat every time I went to the hospital. I also made some good friends at the centre. The Macmillan support line is also here to help, their number is 0808 808 0000 (Monday to Friday 9.00 am to 8.00 pm) and you can get advice, ask questions, speak to a nurse or benefits advisor  or just have a chat. This forum is also so good for chatting to others who have been through the same thing.  I cannot offer advice on breast cancer as I had a different type of cancer but whatever the cancer we all know what each other is going through and support each other in lots of ways. Take care, and try to be as positive as you can.  It is now thought that a positive attitude really helps you get through this. I send you a hug Lynne PS I also went to pieces when I was diagnosed and wanted to run away, so I spent a few days with my daughter and her horses and felt much better.  My daughter said 'Whatever it is you will get through this\" and I'm now almost five years from diagnosis and all scans and tests have been clear since my surgery and chemo.",
