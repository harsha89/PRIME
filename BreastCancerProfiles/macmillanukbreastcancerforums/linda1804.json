      "Content": "Hi, I know what you mean with reference this decision as I only asked this question to my surgeon last friday. I had a invasive duct 2cm tumour which was graded 2/3 Her2, however with chemo that has now shrunk to 8mm and I still have one chemo to go. I am due to have a lumpectomy then rads the first week in March however I am starting to look to the future and wondered it mastectomy would be a better option. My surgeon was pretty firm with me and said that the survival rate for mastectomy and lumpectomy with rads is exactly the same and mastectomy wasnt really an option.... It has played on my mind since then though. I have been advised though on the Breast Cancer Care forum that the main difference is that lumpectomy has a 10% higher recurrence rate to that of mastectomy. I am however going along with my surgeon as I do have faith in him and he has all the facts. I dont have any family history of breast cancer so will do everything I can once the treatment has finished to try and keep this horrible disease at bay and for it never to rear its ugly head again.... I wish you well and that you have come to a decision. Linda x",

I have been suffering really badly with bad vision and nausea.  I am thankful for not taking them today as I am not sure if they were causing me the problem. As with the other replies I am going to mention this to my onocologist next time to see if I need to take them as I didnt see that they helped..   Linda x",

      "Content": "Hi Ive just come back from my surgeon with good and bad news really. Bad news is that the SNB showed that a couple of my nodes showed signs of cancer so when he does the lumpectomy he will also do a node clearance.  This is quite scary ... can anyone tell me if they have had it done too and what does it mean ? The good news was that my 2cm tumor is now shrinking fast after 2 sessions of Chemo, so I am looking at that as positive. Its worrying times though as my Doc has sent for CT and Bode scans , I am assuming to make sure this nasty tumor hasnt gone elsewhere in my body . If anyone can help on the node clearance that would be great. Thanks Loads   Linda x",

I never seem to ask the right questions when I'm infront of the surgeon so it's great coming on here and being able to find out if this has happened to anyone else . I've just gone the bone scans and ct scans to get through now . They are also changing me from FEC to tax on my cycle 4 which I am assuming it normal . Linda X",
