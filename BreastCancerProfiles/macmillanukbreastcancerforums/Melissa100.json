      "Content": "Hi Sam, I am 37 and had the above in September. i was desperate for a mastectomy as I just wanted it all taken away. The reason I had to have one anyway is because my 2 x lumps were just under my nipple. I had reconstruction using the lattismus dorsi muscle which runs down your back. I was really pushed down this route because of my age and sometimes regret the decision, however it was so important to leave hospital with a breast. Because i had chemotherapy so soon after, the whole of the wound became infected and I had to have further surgery which was debilitating. Now, 6 months on, I have 2 large open wounds that nurses have to come and dress 3 times a week. I was very very unlucky, though i still maintain my surgeon did a fantastic job. they wont heal until my chemo is finished - another 3 weeks. I cant underestimate how painful this surgery was as it is major - 6 hours in total, sometimes longer.It really feels as though you have been run over by a lorry. Even my sister who is a nurse and saw the photos of other patients, didnt realise how major it was. But a friend I made in hospital had the same and is 20 years older than me. She recovered brilliantly and started salsa dancing almost straight away. Everyone is different. The only other downside, is that my right breast is bigger than my left,reconstructed one so I do need further surgery for a reduction and then a nipple put onto the left. Sometimes I think, should I have just had a mastectomy and gone for reconstruction a year later? but its too late now and I am pleased that I have a lovely breast, just alot of scars. I think if you are having chemotherapy, I would really really consider delaying. Do you have a breast care nurse? Mine was the one that showed me all the photos of my surgeons work. Does your surgeon have a website? Mine was also a private plastic surgeon, so he had a website showing photos. Surely your surgeon could put you intouch with his/her patients? How about the ward you will be recovering in afterwards? Mine was fantastic and I met alot of women that had the same surgeon as me. Anyway, i could go on forever, but do feel free to get back in touch with me if you want more questions. Best wishes Melissa x",

      "Content": "Hi Sam, I had my chemo too early after the op but it was advised because of the lymph gland involvement. The first session was due 4 weeks after my op but cancelled when the doctor noticed I had an infection in one of the wounds. So the first one was then 3 weeks later - so 6 weeks after my op. Then I became neutropenic (when the white cells drop to a dangerously low level I had to be barrier nursed) and needed a blood transfusion. The second chemo was a good few weeks after that and I have to inject myself the day after with a white blood cell boosting jab to ensure that my body can fight any infections. I am so pleased with my breast though - but in hindsight, if someone could have shown me photos of what can go wrong, perhaps i would have delayed the recon. I remember having to have gas and air while they were \"packing\" the open wounds and a nurse could put her finger in the hole under my breast and out of a hole under my arm... if someone had filmed it and showed me it, I wouldnt have had it, but I was very very unlucky. I did have a go at my surgeon when I was very low and said that because he knew my treatment plan was chemo, before they even operated on me, he shouldnt have advised such a large op but he said it was my decision!! Sometimes they have selective memories! Another thing to consider, is that a friend I made when in hospital with the infection, had had a mastectomy, chemo, radio 2 years earlier and was back in for her recon but had to be taken down to theatre 3 times and in the end had to have the muscle removed because of infection.... you just never know.... A tough decision for you but I am sure I was very very unlucky... and it is on the mend... it would have healed alot quicker had i not been having chemo. The bonus, is that my back is very numb so the wounds no longer painful... i dont know what else to say, I am pleased in a way I got it all out of the way at the same time.... Mel xx",
