      "Content": "Thanks a lot for rplying. No it was couple of years ago when she was first diagnosed with cancer I found this group but never made a use The radiologist checked her and said there isn't any point as she had her last rads in less then three years and there isn't any report suggesting there is any danger in this moment of time. They have given her another two weeks apointment by then after few more tests they will decide about chemo. She has aggressive dcis gradeIII and a v strong history of cancer with all brothers and sisters.Thanks again for rplying  xxx",
