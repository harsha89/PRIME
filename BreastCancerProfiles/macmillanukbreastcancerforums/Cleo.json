      "Content": "Hi Sarah, Thank you for the link, I will get around to looking at the details as I too, feel sure that this area needs to be addressed.  I can't remember where I read it but on one forum I was looking at someone had said that patients with secondary BC appeared not to get as much 'input' from Consultants etc as anyone presenting with a primary diagnosis.  I have to hsasten this has in no way be the experience I have had - primary or secondary but obviously this is not the case everywhere. We seem to have a lot in common - I was first inbtroduced to reflexology whilst having radiotherapy teh first time round and found it most helpful.  Since then I have also tried Reiki and last week had my first session of crystal healing which was amazing.  Following my original dx I basically completely changed my lifestyle, moved to the country, stopped eating dairy, got into yoga and I have tried meditation but struggle a bit with it.  I am tempted with spiritual healing but do not know too much about it but am willing to give anything a go, particularly now. Can I ask what drug regime you are on and if you have any SE's??  How long has it been since your secondary dx?  I'd pm you with some questions but I'm still trying to work out how to use this site lol!! Please feel free to 'boss' me:)  Your knowledge and experience is invaluable to us as patients but I do 'get' how difficult it must be for you to 'be the patient'.   At times like this the 'ignorance is bliss' scenario would probably be very useful on those horrible low days we have to contend with.  I probably sound like a nut but hopefully you see what I mean!!! Thank you again for the support and encouragement....keep in touch Leigh xx    ",

      "Content": "Could really use some help.  I  have been diagnosed with one bone met in my left 6th rib (3 weeks ago) following a primary diagnosis Stage 1, grade 3 ER+, PR+ HER2- right BC in Oct 2009.  I then underwent lumpectomy, SNB x4 (all clear), 2nd lumpectomy in Nov as clear safety margins were not attained 1st time round, commenced on 6 cycles of FEC chemo in Dec 2009 but only managed 5 as my veins packed up.  Had 28 sessions of radiotherapy from April to May 2010 and commenced on Tamoxifen 2010.  Thought I was doing okay until 6 weeks ago, when a rather niggly back ache that came and went  (I had been to the GP's and indeed A&E about and was told was muscular  so didn't think anything more of it) , started to give me increased pain.  A bone can, CXR and CT scan has confimed bone mets or for the posh term oligometastasis. I've spent the past 3 weeks in the most surreal place ever.  I saw my Onc las Thursday who has suggested I have 2 options - surgery to remove the rib and drug regime or radiotherapy and drug regime.  Ive aleady had my first Zoladex injection (now 4 weekly), commenced on Adcal D3, have today picked up my prescription for Ibandronic Acid which I will start Friday and am remaining on Tamoxifen for the time being as my FSH blood tests are saying I'm menopausal but my luteinising hormone says I am peri menopausal.  If I undergo surgery then I will be switched to Arimidex. I'm having a meltdown at the moment because I am due to see Spinal Surgeon tomorrow to discuss surgery and all I keep thinking about is - what if I choose the wrong option for treatment.  I would very much like to hear from anyone who has had experience of rib removal for bone mets.  Or indeed anyone whose been in s similar psotion and really does not know what to do.    I'm quietly terrified of the prospect of developing further mets and 'beating' myself up with the thought that I may already have some more since CT scan 3 weeks ago.   I keep asking myself how did this happen....I've gone from a stage 1 (should have responded well to treatment ) to stage 4 and I do not feel or look ill in any way at all...just a slightly niggly back ache at the moment with a cancer growing!!! Please advise if you can...many thanks      ",

      "Content": "Hello everyonr Thank you all for your postings - Sarah - since my dx I have utilised the Breast Cancer Care website for help and have just got their 'secondary' resource pack.  I have been in quite some turmoil since this 2nd dx (even more so than the first which seems very strange to me), but I am trying to deal with the flood of info and keep it in perspective as much as possible so that all of it does not become all consuming as it so easily could at the moment. a quick update: My hubbie and I saw Spinal Surgeon and he was very straight forward in that 'technically he could remove the rib, however due to its close proximity to the spine and the fact the cancer looks like it may already have attached itself to the pleura (the sack that covers the lung), the met is in a more difficult position to remove and he is not sure he would clear safety margins'.  He was  very upfront in that although it was not impossible surgically  there are w number of risk factors that need to be taken into consideration e.g. by cutting into the bone the cancer could spread into the soft tissue of the lung and vertebrae of the spine; I may end up with chronic long term pain due to all the cutting of muscle and nerves in the area.  Radiotherapy will still need to be done post surgery.  He felt he wanted to speak to some of his Orthopaedic colleagues to get their opinion as well and he will get back to me early next week after also speaking with my Oncologist. Based on the above I am now beginning to think maybe surgery is not thae answer as it could potentially cause more problems long term than solutions.  Ideally all secondary ladies/men would  love to be given the option to be cancer free again but sometimes it just isnt possible.  We have an appointment with my Oncologist again this Thursday so I will be going over the other option of Rads and drugs to stabilise and maintain it.  I know loads of ladies live with bone mets and some have done for years so that gives me some hope. I'm in a slightly better place than I was when I first posted here and really appreciate the support.  This disease can make you feel so lost and alone and being able to identify with others who know exactly what you are feeling or trying to say, makes it not so lonely.  Thank goodness there are these sites:) Leigh xxxx      ",
