    "Content": "Hi wendy, i too had breast cancer in both of my breasts 12months apart and the docs wanted me to have mastectomy followed by chemo then radiotherapy, i suggested to have chemo then radio followed by a double mastectomy as i said \"what you remove you put back at the same time\" they did this using the fat from my tummy and it was the best thing i ever did, i have a better pair now than the originals lol i didnt want implants as they are not maintenance free and with my new pair if you loose weight or put weight on it naturally comes and goes so it keeps everything in proportion. As for the pain i didnt have that much, it wasnt as bad as it sounds maybe i was lucky but i was out of hospital within five days and back to work within three months, i hope my story helps you and i wish you all the very best.Debbie xx",
