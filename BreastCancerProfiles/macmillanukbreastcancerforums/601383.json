      "Content": "Hello to everybody.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2009.  I discussed my options with my breast surgeon and decided to have a lumpectomy, however by the time it came to the operation date, I felt that the lump had grown, so following further discussion with the surgeon, we both agreed that a Mastectomy would be sensible. I had both Chemotherapy and 15 sessions of Radiotherapy. Tests showed that my cancer was HER2 receptive so Herceptin was prescribed.  Last year I was discharged by the breast surgeon and last week I was discharges by the Oncologist.  It's been a long and hard journey, but I'm still here.  Just thought maybe a bit of positive news would be nice to read.  I wish you all the very best of luck.  Hugs xxx",

      "Content": "Hey there sweetheart.  So very sorry for your diagnosis....but please stay very positive.  I was diagnosed in March 2009.  I had Mastectomy, Radiotherapy and then Chemotherapy...I'm still here  I then had Herceptin over a period of time!   I was discharged by the Breast Surgeon last year and last week went for a follow-up appointment with the Oncologist, who also discharged me  Whoo hoo!   I now feel like 'I'm flying without wings', I feel very vulnerable and alone. On a brighter note, I decided to to take my Son and his Wife and their children for a Celebration Meal this evening which was lovely,   Imagine the laughter when the younger grandaughter burst into song singing 'Happy NO cancer in your Boobie, Hip, hip, hooray'.  She is just 7!!  Keep your positivity!  I hope I've helped you see the light at the end of a pretty long tunnel.  Wishing you luck and love.  xx",
