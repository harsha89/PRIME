      "Content": "Hi Wendloui, I'm just a year post surgery, had a WLE and ANC and had awfull cording but I persevered with my exercises for several weeks and one day it had just disappeared. The BCNs were very reassuring when I phoned and said that if it hadn't cleared up in a couple of weeks they would refer me to Physio. So sorry you've had to go through two surgeries in for weeks not much fun, but believe it or not the time will pass quite quickly one you start your other treatment. Can believe it's over a year since this all began for me.  I think it's a defence mechanism this feeling that it's happening to some else, it almost makes it easier to deal with at the time, it certainly did for me, so I really think it's normal.  This forum really helps though great support from everyone.  Keep smiling and wishing you all the best.",

      "Content": "Hi Daisy,, i can relate to your feelings, I didn't feel any lumps, I just went for my routine mammogram April 2015 as I walked a way I just knew they'd find a cancer, I've have many mammograms in the past but I have never had such a overwhelmingly negative feeling before. I was not surprised when I got the recall letter and coped much better with the diagnosis than my family and friends. I to am a nurse albeit retired one and nurses cope with everything, don't they, I think this coping mechanism helped get me through all the appointment, the surgery and radiotherapy. It was when all my treatment was finished, I found I went to pieces, when all the hospital visits were over, I got off the treadmill and didn't know how to feel what to feel or how to move on. I felt so alone and isolated even thought  I was surrounded by family and friends all trying to help.  This forum helped and so did the BCNs and I got on with my life, I have lots of good days now the bad days are very few and far between. I can laugh now about being turned down for counselling as I wasn't  depressed enough..  I have my first annual mammogram and follow up appointment on the 20/6 and on 9/6 it will be a year since I had my surgery.  I hope for your sake you get good news on Tuesday, I will be keeping my fingers crossed. If the news is not so good then you will get though this, we all do, you will find the strength you need. Ask for help when you need it, talk to someone about how you are feeling, it's really scary but you aren't on you own. We have all been where you are.  Will be thinking of you and keeping my fingers crossed. ",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, I found RT the easiest part of the treatment, it was a doddle, once I got used to the mildly uncomfortable position they put your arms in. Each session was over very quickly it took longer setting up and getting me in the correct position. I liberally applied Diprobase lotion after treatment and before I went to bed. I used simple soap and avoided products containing Zinc.  My boob got a bit red and itchy, but nothing I couldn't cope with, it continued for several weeks after I finished treatment. I got occasional twinges in my boob but whether that was due to the RT or the surgery I don't know. The 52 mile round trip to Truro and back was more exhausting.  I have always found that things are never as bad or as painful as you imagine they will be,  Keep smiling it will be fine. I am now nearly 9 months post RT and a year post surgery and in a couple of weeks I will be having my first annual check up, my next hurdl.  In a few months I will probably look back and wonder why I was worried.  Onwards and upwards. I am just off to enjoy the beach with my grandchildren.  Take care. ",

      "Content": "Hi Lizzie55, welcome to the forum, so sorry you are suffering pain and numbness. It can be very very uncomfortable and debilitating, it's early days though and will improve, but it can take some time. Nerve pain, where the nerves are stretch or damaged, can be very painful  and vary from numbness, tingling, pins and needles to painful burning sensations, bit like very bad sunburn.  I had my surgery last June lumpectomy and axillary node clearance, I found the nerve pain unbearable, that has subsided now but I am left with numbness and a few strange feeling in my arm. It is bearable though and more importantly still improving. When it was at it most uncomfortable I was prescribed neuropathic pain killers, special painkillers for nerve pain, don't be afraid to ask if it's really bad.  I found the exercises really helped and they still do, the heart shaped cushion helps to,especially when travelling sitting or trying to sleep. It all takes time though, my BCN told me I was far too impatient.  Try and remain positive, it difficult at times, but remember to ask for help if you need it. I have found this forum and my BCNs so supportive.  Good luck and look forward to hearing about your progress. ",

      "Content": "Hi, It's all relative smoking, drinking alcohol regularly and being over weight carry an equal if not higher risk. The increased risk only arises if you take combined HRT after 50, we are all expected to have our own oestrogen and progesterone until we are 50, if you take it for 5 years before you are 50 there is no increased risk.  There is also quality of life to be considered if you are one of the unlucky women who have horrendous hot flushes, night sweats or crushing tiredness and vaginal atrophy, taking HRT may be the only option.  I had a premature menopause aged 40 and could not have functioned without HRT, I took HRT for 20 years, I only needed oestrogen as I'd had an hysterectomy, but, yes 28 years later I've had breast cancer but whose to say I wouldn't have been one of the 14 in 1000 who got it anyway.  I once spoke to a young women of 30 who had breast cancer and had been plunged into a chemical menopause because of chemo, she was in bits and said if she had known what it was going to be like she would rather have kept the cancer. I have never forgotten the anguish of that young women, I often think of her and hope things improved for her sake.  And before anyone mention the alternatives to HRT, the \"natural\" phytoestrogen from plants red clover, black cohosh, soya etc  these are all oestrogens however natural, not much research has been done into them and they are unregulated whose to say they do not carry the same risk. I am not for HRT and against alternatives but afraid that some people think that because the phytoestrogens are \"natural\" they carry no risk.  I think people should have a choice, an informed choice, weighing up all the facts, the risks and the benefits before they decide. I do not think the lurid headline \"combined HRT increases your risk of breast cancer by 60%\" is helpful. It's actually an extra 20 women per 1000 if taken for 4 to 5 years 14 women per thousand will get it anyway and once you stop it apparently your risk the returns to normal.  Sorry to get on my high horse but I always get cross when I see all this hype and misinformation in the press. A particular bug bear of mine is the headline that is frequently lauded about the combined pill, \"taking the pill doubles your risk of a a deep vein thrombosis \"DVT\" or pulmonary embolism \"PE\" yes it does 2 in 10000 women will get a DVT or PE anyway, if you take the combined pill it increases to 4 per 10000 women what they forget to tell you is that if you get pregnant the risk trebles to 6 per 10000 women.  End of rant. ",

It's really important to do the exercise though, religiously, they do help, with the stiffness, improving movement and prevents cording. I found it also helped with pain relief. If you are having RT you need the exercises to prepare for the awkward positions your arms are placed in during treatment. If you do the exercises it's amazing how quickly the movement returns.  I hope the rest of your treatment goes well, fingers crossed, will be thinking of you",

The S/Es were easily manageable, paracetamol for the flu like symptoms, only occurred after the first infusion and the swollen painful knees, which Ive had pretty regularly all my life, with ibuprofen or etoricohib a newer and stronger form of NSAID (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs). In the scheme of things if it decreases my risk of a recurrence then I'm prepared to put up with my occasional aching swollen knees, which I would probably have anyway.  All you can do is try it, don't expect the worst, you may be lucky and get none or very mild manageable S/Es.  Hope this helps. ",

Please don't despair, follow the moisturisering instructions, washing instructions simple soap, avoid tight clothing that rubs you don't have to worry about avoiding sun burn at the moment.  The majority of people just have a few aches and pains, slight sunburn and itchiness. That's all I had honest, the pinkness, itchiness and niggley pain went on for a few weeks after finishing treatment but I just kept on applying Diprobase liberally.  You do need to be aware of the other problems keep an eye out for blisters and burns and report them as soon as you can but please don't expect them to happen.

      "Content": "Please don't  fear the menopause, hot flushes and night sweat, they are all manageable  There are an awful lot of myths and misinformation surrounding the \"menopause\" . I don't claim to be an expert but I did a lot of research into it and the changes that occur around the time of the \"change\" when I had an early menopause aged 39-40. Good website www.menopausematters.co.uk Average age of the menopause is 51, menopause just means your last period. It is retrospective and you can't be judged as being post menopausal for two years if your last period was before the age 51 and one year if you're over 51, it's a bit abitory really. The time leading up to your last period, the perimenopause, lasts approximately 10 years as your ovaries gradually wind down. As your ovaries produce less and less oestrogen hot flushes, night sweats and sometimes crushing tiredness start to appear and over time become more frequent. Usually, at first, women start to notice hot flushes and night sweats just before their next period, periods become less or more frequent. As every female is different no two perimenopause are the same. Chemo can cause a chemical menopause, it can be temporary or in some cases permanent, as your ovaries struggle to produce oestrogen symptoms like irregular or no periods, hot flushes and night sweats may stop and start.  Tamoxifen and other anti oestrogen medication can cause hot flushes and night sweat as well. The menopause should be embraced, not feared, don't listen to the horror stories, do your own research and make up your own minds.  Remember though some \"natural\" remedies for menopause symptom contain plant oestrogen and there is not much reliable research around them and their relationship with breast cancer.  Also ladies because our bones need oestrogen for bone strength, diet and weight bearing exercise becomes vitally important once we stop producing our own oestrogen to maintain our bone strength.  www.menopausematters.co.uk",

If you don't understand anything they say, take you're time and ask them to explain.  Good luck and keep smiling",

They say the effects of RT continue to develope for several months after its finished and I reckon that's true, it was more painful for several months after I finished, soreness and occasional stabbing pains. It now has settled down again but still tender to touch, it's also very lumpy but was reassured by my Surgeon this June that it was perfectly normal.  Please get it checked if you are worried, there's no sense in sitting at home worrying.  Fingers crossed",

I wish I had a pound for everytime a patient came to me frightened to death of having a treatment because some well meaning \"friend\" had told them about someone they knew who had had horrendous side effects or had surgery they had never recovered from. No one ever tells you about the success stories. You need to know the risks involved, the possible side effects but not about aunt fanny whose arms and legs fell off when she took a paracetamol. Sorry thats facetious but it's important to get the information you need from the people, be they doctors nurses or radiographer who  are treating you. If your not happy with what they tell you or you feel things are being glossed over, ask again and again until you feel happy, if you don't understand something tell them and ask them to explain again.  I was lucky I didn't need chemo but in over forty years of working the NHS I have seen many courageous cancer survivors, yes they had side effects, some had an awful lot of discomfort, tiredness, nausea and depression but the one thing they all agreed on that it was worth it in the end.",

      "Content": "Hi, The side effects associated with any drug are listed originally on the Data Sheets that have to be included with any drug. The list of S/E is complied during the research period any new drug has to go through, it records any adverse reaction or death that occurs during these research trials, believe it or not these trial are covered by many stringent laws, rules and regulations and drug companies have to jump through hoops to get a drug passed for human consumption. Once passed it is classed as a \"black triangle\" drug, cos in any drug formulary it is highlighted by a black triangle, warning that it is a new drug and Docs nurses and pharmacists have to record and report any adverse reactions by law. It's important we as the consumers of these drugs report any unusual side effect to the medical profession or pharmacists or we can report them ourselves via the \"yellow card system\". Google it.  Although it may take 20 years to develope a drug, from first idea to being passed for human consumption, sometimes unacceptable side effects do not become obvious for many years.  It also depends on the severity disease a drug is designed to deal with, before the S/E are deemed to be unacceptable and the drug is withdrawn, what side effects are unacceptable, for say paracetamol would not be the as the unacceptable side effects of a drug say for cancer, its all relative.  So yes there is an official list of S/E for any drug, the drug companies have to list them, by law, all on a data sheet and in all the research papers that have to be submitted before a drug is passed or licensed for use.  Research and Developement of a new drug is time consuming and very very expensive, probably in the millions of pounds, that's why new drugs are so expensive. The rarer the disease the more expensive the drug, then it has to be ok'd for use in the NHS by National  Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), it  works on the principle of numbers needed to treat to make it cost effective. Research and Developement is funded by the Pharmaceutical companies themselves not the government or the NHS and many new drugs do not make it final production so all the time and money spent on man hours, research and testing is wasted.  Sorry if I sound a bit biased but having worked in research and Developement in the Pharmaceutical industry i know just how much is involved in producing a new drug. Perhaps if the government funded some of the research drugs would not cost so much. Pharmaceutical companies only have 20 years to recoup the cost of R&D before any Tom Dick or Harry can manufacture it generically and sell it at a fraction of the cost. New drugs are protected by patent for a limited time only not a life time like other patents.  I had to do a week long course and pass an exam just to be able to monitor volunteers taking part in drug trials.  I apologise in advance if this post upsets or annoys anyone. Yes Pharmaceutical companies make a lot of money but a lot of money is spent on developing new drugs, it is the system that is wrong.  If any of you feel you have had an adverse reaction to any drug report it under the \"yellow card system\". ",

I still cannot wear a wired bra but got some Triumph magic wire bras, they actually have a silicone wire and are very comfortable, I probably could have worn them immediately post op as they are so soft and comfortable.  If you already wear sports bras, the ones you normally wear will probably do as long as they give good support, I wore mine to sleep in for several weeks.  I hope that, eventually!

Gentle massaging helped and my exercises.   I was prescribed Pregabalin, neuropathic pain killer like Gabapentin, it was brilliant but you have to reduce the dose slowly as if you stop suddenly you can suffer withdrawal symptoms. Can make you feel a bit euphoric though probably why I did have any anxiety whilst I was taking it. Also the heart cushion the hospital gave me helped a lot, tucking it between my arm and chest wall seemed to reduce the discomfort and still does, I use it ever night, like a comfort blanket.  You can get them from Jen's Friends Heart Pillows for Mastectomies on Facebook  I was paranoid about lymphodema to, even resorted to measuring my upper arm on occasion.  If you are worried about anything just phone the BCNs I found the brilliant and so patient and reasurring. It's early days for you, its nearly ten months since I had my surgery, but things will get better, keep smiling, keep talking and above keep positive.",

      "Content": "Hello Sarah, how much pain/discomfort you get following your axcillary clearance will depend on the  extent of the stretching and bruising  of the nerves under your arm. Hopefully it can be controlled by paracetamol and ibuprofen or codeine but there are some of us who suffer quite bad nerve pain, (parathesia) altered sensation in your arm, intermittent burning, tingly or numbness. I couldn't tolerate anything touching my arm. If you do find that the first line pain killers don't control the discomfort don't be afraid to ask your GP for something stronger, a neuropathic painkiller. I don't think enough is said pre-op about nerve damage and Parathesia I think it was glossed over and I wasn't prepared for the intensity of the discomfort, ironic really I was a nurse for forty years and I just was prepared for it. Nine months on I still have some numbness and have been told it may be permanent.  Please don't worry I sure you will be fine but I wish I had been warned that it could happen and then may be I could have coped with it better.  Driving I didn't drive for 3 to 4 weeks then got back into it slowly, the exercises are really important though. They really helped and am still doing them twice a day.  I really hope things go well for you this week, keep positive and take all the help offered, I used to phone the BCNs over what now seem to be the most trivial things. They were always calm and reassuring. Good luck",

Don't sit at home wondering it always better to ask, so put your mind at rest and phone someone.  Fingers crossed you feel better soon.  Thinking of you. ",

      "Content": "Hi Jump123, It's perfectly normal for your imagination to be in overdrive, as you put it. I find mine goes into overdrive each time a new experience looms on the horizon.  When you go for your pre-assessment for your RT treatment you should get the opportunity to discuss all your worries with the Radiographers, I did. They were lovely and listened to all my worries and reassured me.   I dreaded RT but found to my surprise it wasn't too bad I found the 52 mile round trip, during August (I live in Cornwall and the summer traffic is awful) was the worst part. I was very careful and used Simple soap to wash and Diprobase lotion on my boob after each treatment and at night. My boob got a bit sore and achy, the skin got a little pink and itchy like mild sunburn, it continued to get pinker for about 6 weeks after I finished treatment. It is still a slightly different colour after 7 months.  I have always found that things are never as bad as you imagined them to be, may be because I was a nurse I always expect the worst and am pleasantly surprised when things aren't as bad.  My new philosophy is going to be the worst has happened it can only  get better.  Talk to everyone, someone,  don't bottle things up, I did and I got to almost breaking point, no one will think you're  nuts. I thought I was going mad until I poured my heart out to my BCNs and they told me what I was feeling was perfectly normal. Once the dam had broken I could tell every one how I was feeling and it was such a relief.  Like a heavy weight being lifted off me.  Keep smiling keep positive, scream and shout or cry if it makes you feel better.  No one will judge you.  Fingers always crossed, let us know how you get on",

I use an iPod and listen to music or an audio book, any thing to stop my over active brain going into over drive. If I cannot get to sleep I get up make a hot drink, read for a bit then try again.  There are some really good relaxation techniques available, Google it. It is really worth persevering and they do work if you can master them.  I have also found I sleep better if I avoid watching TV or looking at my computer or iPad just before I go to sleep.  Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi cec, The truth is we are not all brave all of the time, just sometimes, sometimes our bravery deserts us, at the most unusual times,  everyone is different. I remained brave right up until I finished my RT, I had a little wobble on 9 June, the morning of my surgery, but really when to pieces in December when everything was over. Probably cos I bottled everything up and was determined to show everyone I was coping, it all got too much.  I had a melt down with the BCNs at our Breast Cancer Unit, I'd requested the appointment because I couldn't understand why I felt so awful when I'd finished RT and felt so lost.  It is now a year since I was diagnosed 11 months since my surgery 9 months since I finished RT, I was lucky I didn't need chemo, looking back I wonder if I hadn't held it together so well all through treatment and screamed and shouted a lot more, my meltdown wouldnt have quite so bad. Hey ho we all deal with thing differently.  You will be brave, you will get through this, we all do, it may seem like a huge and terrifying mountain to climb, at the moment but each step is small and you will get over the top and reach the other side, what's  a few tears, screams and shouts on the way.  My next step is my first annual mammogram and review in June. Another little step, how I will cope I do not know but I know I will.   You and all the people on this forum are amazing but we are not brave all of the time.  Happy birthday for Monday, try and enjoy it. You will get through this and be smiling on the other side. ",

      "Content": "Judging by the replies it seems to be a pretty normal reaction, exactly how I felt, I couldn't understand why I felt so crap, tearful and irritable when I should have been on top of the world finishing all my treatment. I felt totally bereft, just like I did in 2012/13 when my mother died, I'd been her Carer for over ten years. I really didn't know what to do with myself. On both occasions my days where mapped out, I didn't have to make any decisions, just got on and coped, a treadmill of caring and more recently a treadmill of hospital appointments, surgery and treatment.  I just didn't know what to do or how to back to being me.  Sounds like you are starting to make plans and taking steps to get back on track, telling someone how you are really feeling also helps.  Good luck and keep smiling ",

I was prescribed pregabalin, the relief was wonderful, the pain (altered sensation) did not go completely but at least it was bearable and I found I could sleep at last. I manage without anything now but still struggle some days, I find the stretching exercises, they gave me before the surgery, really help also when I feel it becoming intense I get up and distract myself. It is not easy but I think its getting better everyday. One of the most difficult things I have found is explaining to my family how numbness can be so painful.  Good luck Keep smiling it will get better and more bearable ",
