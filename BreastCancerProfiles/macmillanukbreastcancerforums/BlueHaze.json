    "Content": "Hello Maggie, sounds like you've been through alot, congratulations on finishing your treatment and congratulations that the cancer has gone from your organs, so happy for you! It must be a relief for you. Sounds like you're getting alot of physical symptoms from your anxiety which definitely doesn't help. I had similar anxiety issues, heart pounding, sweating, palms sweaty, breathlessness etc and my doctor put me on Propanolol. It has helped me so, so much. It minimises the physical symptoms so I can concentrate on getting my head in the right place again. It's very hard to concentrate when you can hear your heart beating in your ears! It may be worth you bobbing down to the Drs and see if they can put you on anything to help with the physical symptoms. As for the mental anxiety, it may be worth trying to find some coping methods for yourself. Are there any books that you really enjoy reading that don't require much concentration? Music? Do you have an iPod or MP3 player? It may be worth filling that up with your favourite music and taking that with you or better yet, just having it with you all the time! Do you have any hobbies/interests? Good luck Maggie with your bone scan, if you need anything, just drop me a line - your post has struck a chord with me and I'd love to help you out in anyway I can. Hope you start to feel better soon Maggie, congratulations again on the end of your successful treatment :)",
