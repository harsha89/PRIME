    "Content": "Hi Tracey, A huge congratulations and well done on finishing the chemo but sorry to hear that you're still suffering. I have only heard of these sorts of aches and pains from people undergoing chemo at the time, not after, though this is not to say that it cannot happen.Â  I know chemo and various medications can affect bone strength in the long term, particularly in females as well where it occurs naturally more so than in men, so it may be worth going back to your doctor and looking into it, just for your own piece of mind. Hope you feel better soon. Jeff",
