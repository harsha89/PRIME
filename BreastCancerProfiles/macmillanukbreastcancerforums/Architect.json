      "Content": "Hi, My wife's recently undergone EC and paxo taxcyl (apologies for the spelling!) for breast cancer. She really suffered from nausea during treatment and as such was on quite a cocktail of anti-sickness drugs, which eventually got on top of it and she struggled through. Due to contracting shingles about two-thirds of the way through her course, and subsequently getting extreme nausea and struggling to eat, the consultant stopped the treatment (and after scans, it looks as if the treatment she did receive has reduced the cancer to pretty much nothing, which is great!). Surgery's due in a couple of weeks. The problem is that she's now still feeling awful with nausea, seven weeks after finishing chemo, and is still struggling to eat much at all. Obviously this is leading to anxiety (which she suffers from anyway) about being well and strong enough for surgery. She's lost a lot of weight, and just the last couple of days has been vomiting first thing in the morning. As of just now the GP has suggested getting back onto her anti-sickness, which she came off a week ago as she felt it wasn't doing much for her, so fingers crossed that will help. Just wanted to know if anyone else has had to deal with this prolonged nausea/sickness weeks after chemo, and whether there's an end to this?? Many thanks in advance!",

      "Content": "Hi TheScriptFan, Thanks for responding! Actually I had tried the oncology team first, the breast care nurse second, and then the GP. While I'm not complaining - they all do amazing work - the oncology team stated that \"it wasn't a chemo issue, being so long after she'd finished, so there wasn't much we can do - speak to the GP\", the breast care nurse is very nice, but more associated with surgery which hasn't happened, so again not very useful, so the only help we had was from the GP. We seem to be falling between a few stools here. But yes, eating little and often is what we're trying to do. Its just strange (or is it?) that this is all dragging on for so long post-chemo... Thanks again.",
