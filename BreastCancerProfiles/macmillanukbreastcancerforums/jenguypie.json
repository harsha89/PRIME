    "Content": "i am 99% certain that i will not be having chemo i also had mastectomy in Dec 08 no spread to nodes i was offered it as added extra . it has been a thought provoking decision to make as i have experienced chemo before and it was not the best time of my life the way i see it is if there is no spread then it has gone. if i get another cancer again in another 10 years time then that is meant to be . i had chemo before for same sort of cancer er receptive and just had same cancer again so......... it is a tough call but we have the last word that is only my opinion and my choice. jen",
