    "Content": "Hi Joanne, I found out last Tuesday I have breast cancer too, I am having my operation on 18th. I am angry as I cannot believe I have cancer again, I had and operation to remove thyroid cancer in 2008., but I am determined to stay positive, my surgeon told me \"you have beaten cancer once and you can do it again\". But I am scared. Marilyn",
