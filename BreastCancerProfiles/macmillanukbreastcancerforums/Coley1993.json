      "Content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m just wondering if anyone knows why some people have \u201cFEC\u201d and some have \u201cEC\u201d I was told first I was having fec and then was changed to EC.. does anyone know the difference? Has anyone who had ec feel like the chemos get easier ? My first one was really hard .. but after a week I feel normal again.  Did everyone loose all brows and lashes ?  Thanks xxx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m 25 and just about to do my 3rd out of 6 EC chemos. I\u2019m Grade 3, 21mm ER+ no effected nodes and oncotype of 18. I had a double mastectomy and clear margins. I really hate chemo I felt so strong before but chemo is making me feel so poorly and sad, the cold cap isn\u2019t working. I have heart palpitations, trouble breathing and sickness is unbearable! I\u2019m considering stopping my chemo and going straight on tamoxifen as apparently all my cancer is gone and this is just precaution. Has anyone else found themselves in a similar situation and stopped adjuvant chemo? Will 2 chemos make any difference ?  Thanks xxx",

I would also panic if I didn\u2019t do the chemos and blame myself if it came back. It\u2019s just the worst thing having your life threatened isn\u2019t it .. there\u2019s never a straight answer in the cancer world from doctors that\u2019s what I struggle with!  What made you struggle with letrazol ???  Thanks girls xxxx",

      "Content": "Aww thanks girls,  It\u2019s so hard, I cried through my second chemo too it\u2019s the fear of knowing what\u2019s coming and the slow red coming down that tube   The nurses thought was the cold cap but really I was just scared of the chemo haha. i also have complete baldness on the back of my head and thinning at the top :( I know everyone says it grows back but it\u2019s so traumatic seeing it slowly fall out and knowing all them painful hours were for nothing ! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to shave it off even the patch at the back makes me feel creeped out.  I\u2019ve used something called \u201cjust nutrive - grow new hair \u201c before this for thickening up my hairline and it was amazing really worked, it won\u2019t work while having treatment but I\u2019ve stocked up on shampoo and the growing oil for when I finish. It\u2019s not cheap but really works .. sooner it comes back the better haha! I wish I had chemo first to be honest so I could feel the Tumour shrinking to give me the incentive, it\u2019s too easy to stop when it\u2019s preventing (and can still come back) its a lot to go through Xxx",
