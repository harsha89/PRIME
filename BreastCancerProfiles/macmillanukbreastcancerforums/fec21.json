      "Content": "Hello there, please don't worry..I'm the same, ERneg her2pos grade3 ...I had chemo first for 6 rounds, then a mastectomy, and then 4 weeks of radiotherapy...I was diagnosed Jan 2017, and a large tumour attached to my chest wall ( nearly5cm). My chemo was divided into two different types, and though they were strong, I was able to listen to my body, and ride the worst first 8 days, then recover to a feeling of worthy normality...it's a process that shouldn't frighten you.. each of us are unique, and we have to try and ride the waves of our treatment. It is amazing how much research is done for the excellent staff to know what drugs to give each individual.  My tumour shrank, and it spurred me on. I can't answer where inner strength comes from, yet we do find it! The only advice I can say is to embrace it like a cold, then poke it in the eye! Laugh with it, and stay cheerful. Remember who you were before cancer, and remember you are still the same inside( even if it's hard to show it)... and to top it all...it's ok to have wobble days...in one year, I've had about 5, then I take hold, put on a necklace and say to it...you are Not going to get me!!  Yes, it may come back, but we are in the best possible hands with the NHS, I am awaiting results for my spine...but I won't let this get me down...I think us women have a great sense of strength. And I wish you every success with your treatment..x",

      "Content": "Hello there...I am also with Southampton, and they are amazing! It is rated on par with Royal Marsden, and I can't fault them at all...you will be in safe hands.  I was diagnosed a year ago this week with ER- Her2 pos grade 3 ( nearly 5cm) . I had 6 rounds of chemo first, 2 different types of 3 drugs, then a mastectomy, and later 4 weeks of radiotherapy. I will finish herceptin in April, where I have it at our local hospice, Oakhaven.  Use the breastcare nurses, that are available ( they will give you a card with names/ telephone on it). The bedside manner of all the staff , I can't fault. They really work with what's best for you, as we are All individuals, and all our cancers are slightly different according to how it reacts in our bodies.. I wish you all the very best, and you'll bounce from Princess Anne, to the oncology unit...stay strong, and poke it in the eye! X",
