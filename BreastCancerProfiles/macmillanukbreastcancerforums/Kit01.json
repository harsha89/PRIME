    "Content": "Hi Susie, definitely give the cold cap a go and don't be alarmed when you do shed some hair. I am 4.5 months in with 4 weeks to go and was ready to give up with the cold cap after the 2nd time as it's pretty unpleasant and I was losing hair but you'll be surprised at how much hair you have! I have continued to lose hair throughout my treatment and it has thinned a fair amount but I really am the only one who notices this. I use a product called Nanogen to give the illusion of slightly thicker / denser hair which works really well and Colour Wow is great product for touching in your roots if you need to do this. I don't have any bald patches so can style it as normal and it looks fine. My hair is already growing back too which was a bit of a surprise. The cold cap becomes much more bearable  - I can now have a nice snooze with it on so please don't be put off if your first experience isn't great. I wash my hair 1-2 times per week. I used to wash my hair daily so didn't think I would be able to cope with not washing it but my hair has changed and doesn't get greasy so it's been perfectly do-able. I do recommend a silk pillow case - it really seems to help with my hair not needing a lot of styling and pretty much looking ok with just a quick brush in the morning. Hope this helps and I hope your first session goes well. ",
