    "Content": "So glad to read about your experience as I did not get to the hospital soon enough.  Okay now but I realise how important this temperature thing is and will be monitoring myself more carefully after the 2nd Chemo next week.  I was in isolation for 4 days.  Hopefully I will not find myself in that position again. I am apprehensive about my next dose of Chemo but the dose is being reduced, so fingers crossed I will have less of a reaction this time.",
