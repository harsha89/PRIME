I mentioned it to my nurse practitioner at my oncology review appointment and she said it was the tamoxifen. So you can see why I'd put it down to that. Not sure who to approach as practitioner has said either it'll go off or you'll get used to it (sorry what!) my BCN is quite frankly rubbish. Although I suppose she could discuss at the MDT meeting.

      "Content": "Hi All Haven't posted for a while as I seem to be getting back into the daily grind. All treatments complete and only check up appointments left to do (apart from permanent reconstruction but next breast clinic appt is December so not even thinking about that yet). My question is about tamoxifen and I apologise in advance as I know it's been talked to death. I've looked through historical posts and can't quite find an answer relevant to me. I've been taking tamoxifen for forty days. When I started I was still experiencing side effects from chemo so it has taken a while to narrow down what causes what. I now feel like I understand what the tamoxifen is doing. I was given wockhardt brand which, from memory, is a brand that some found the easiest to deal with.  I am suffering from painful hands and feet, escalating to wrists and ankles, sometimes reaching as far as the elbow and knee and occasionally one hip! The worst part for me is my thumb base, worse in my dominant hand, causing me to need help (or suffering pain if there's nobody around) when I try to do things like opening pop bottles, opening bags of crisps or similar, closing press studs, pulling up trousers, squeezing the toothpaste tube. I'm sure there's a hundred more things but you get the gist. I love to cross stitch and I'm afraid the pain is cramping my style in that area too. So, on to my question, has anyone been in the same boat, with this brand? (Or is it really the best one) And if so, was there anything that would ease the pain, or did you change brand successfully? I'm reluctant to change brand as one of my initial worries was that the tamoxifen would turn me into superbitch, but it has mellowed my mood massively and I don't get the irrational mood swings I was getting (my whole life) previously. Does anyone know if changing brand would have any effect in that area? Many thanks in advance as always.",

I would check with your oncologist just to make sure what is causing these annoying aches and pains Maxinem  I was told they can last for months so I will just take things a day at a time and fingers crossed things will get better Hi JB thanks for your input - I wonder then if that proves (ish) the theory that it is PN causing the problem. I thought it was tamoxifen but you take a different product and have the same symptoms. I walk like my legs and feet are made of wood after I've sat or laid for a long time and have fallen over several times! I can't walk far and if I need a wee, I grind to a halt,  my energy is completely sapped until I've been! I also feel like there's little tiny spiders walking on the tops of my feet (great fun) oh dear - what a palaver!",

So, if there is any invasive cancer in there, it will only serve to confirm that a mastectomy was the right plan of action.  When my breast tissue was examined after the mastectomy, they found another, smaller invasive cancer in there which hadn't shown up on mammogram or ultrasound. I was so glad that the surgeon had decided on mastectomy as otherwise I feel I would have had a time bomb ticking inside me! Advice for your hospital stay and/or early days after surgery.... Small beanbag type cushion to help you get comfortable under your arm or between your arm and breast. Cloth small shopping bag to pop your drain into (if you're having one) which will help you get around hands free. Small blanket for laying on the couch watching box sets! Nice and cosy yet easy to pop away if you don't need it.  Get some post surgery bras. Marks And Spencer do a good range VAT free, there's a link in another thread. And ...... look after yourself!

Breast cancer is very treatable, so if you were unfortunate enough to receive a cancer diagnosis, you would very quickly be given a treatment plan. This would focus your mind and give you a stable platform from which to proceed. The first thing I told my daughter when I was diagnosed with cancer was,'but I'm absolutely NOT going to die so NEVER worry about that'. I actually believe that too. I have a friend who had the exact same symptoms as me but several months later. I was getting ready to console and advise. I didn't say this to her, but was really concerned for her. She came away from her mammogram and ultrasound with a diagnosis of a benign fibroadenoma. She went on holiday with her family to celebrate the relief! You just can't call it!

As I had an appointment with onco on wednesday, they advised waiting until then and to let her know. I'd had many other issues after my first 'T' all of which caused my onco to reduce the dose for the next chemo which I had yesterday. She also gave me some additional steroids, slightly reduced dose for three additional days to push me past those rough moments.  One big toenail has stayed the same with just a small area of light bruising, the other is fully purple up to approx 70% of it's length. Fingernails are ridged across the way but no peel or flake as yet. The soles of my feet have started with what I call dry blisters, not sore, just peeling skin in a bubble begging to be picked off! I shall resist! And Kacang..... I always wear crocs around the house instead of slippers, although the slip on type like pool shoes with just the front band across. I bought a blue pair and a red pair for holidays several years ago. Very expensive at around £25 a pair but obviously last ages and perfect for popping on and off in harmony with my hot flushes and burning feet!  Happy weekend everyone, I am spending mine on the couch after knowingly overdoing it last time.

Hi Amanda My local hospital has an access lounge who deal with all preparations for surgery, where you attend to get gowned up etc and then are escorted to theatre. Perhaps if your hospital has a unit similar you could call them to enquire? I didn't have a dressing gown, they gave me a hospital one to wear. They gave me paper pants, I presumed they would catheterise me, as they did when I'd had three Caesarian sections. But they had confidence in my bladder obviously and it doesn't seem to be the norm for breast surgery so that is a real plus point! It's a worrying time, but you will be well looked after no matter what.  Take care x",

I had a lymph node biopsied one time and that was the most painful of any, yet still perfectly manageable. I would say I've had equivalent pain from dental treatment over the years.

I'm not an expert and your father's cancer is different to mine being triple negative (mine is ER positive) but, I would expect that the mass was removed, with clear margins i.e. The whole cancer was taken away with a border of good cells. He would have either had lymph nodes from the armpit removed, or the surgeon didn't think it appropriate. Then the chemo and radio kill off any stray cells which may be lurking. i don't know what happens at his next appointment, as I haven't got that far myself. It all sounds as if his treatment is almost over and he will then just be monitored periodically. I'm sure someone else who knows a little more will be able to help  Best wishes X",

Perhaps it would have happened anyway, who knows. I was given hirudoid cream but I don't feel it did much to ease the pain. I still have this discomfort now as the veins slowly repair after chemo. The heartburn is an easier fix! If you mention it at your onco appointment they can prescribe a daily tablet, mine was lansoprazole and removed all traces of discomfort.

I\u2019ve mentioned it to my GP who sent me for a chest X-ray even though I knew and she confirmed that it would only show up something quite far advanced and not anything in early stages.

I'm half way through chemo as we speak and I haven't regretted grabbing every chance of improvement I can get. My point is, even if your medical team insist on chemo, the improvement is small, yet they recommend it.  There are people who say no to chemo.

I thought I'd be incapacitated. Also I discussed with my nurse consultant how I felt about filigrastin injections. For some reason I have not enjoyed one bit either the daily injection or the side effects (most worrying, intense anger!)? My partner hasn't really relished administering these but has always said,\"no it's fine\". The nurse consultant has prescribed me a slow release one off injection taken 24 hours after chemo, which may still have the side effects but will rid me of the daily dread for both me and my partner. Please let me stay problem free until I get home at 2.30 today! Let's get crafting!",

The reason for expander rather than immediate implant was the fact I would be having radiotherapy as a definite and I didn't want to have good work done to potentially fail.  My sister had a mastectomy saving no skin recently, just a month or so before me,  and she had the expander to stretch her skin to allow an implant to be fitted. Hers is going along perfectly and she is due replacements in a month or two. She is in Spain. I'm not sure what has happened in my case. I am half way through chemo and will then move on to radiotherapy. My expander has never really looked right. In the back of my mind I think i have too much skin for it to sit behind but that could just be my imagination ( I can make things fit so well since having cancer!) My oncologist thinks the expander has been pierced when having a seroma drained but I'm not convinced. It is as if the expander has rolled over and fallen to the bottom.... One of my two surgeons called in sick of the morning of my surgery, I was in tears. I don't want to think that had anything to do with it Given all of that bad news!!! The veritas  has performed perfectly. I have a small strange boob currently, and can see and feel some of the outline of the edges of the expander and I have a pointed bit which uncomfortably sticks up next to my nipple. I didn't actually expect anything better, and have accepted the faults as this was an entirely temporary situation. The veritas does cause a reaction with the body but in a very mild, polite way with a little discolouration initially. The pectoral part doesn't complain at all, and it's just the expander that gives me a little discomfort. If I overdo things lifting or activity wise, it can be more uncomfortable and the seroma I've been fending off comes back a little to put me in my place.  I must be honest and say I'd love to be done with the discomfort, treatment, surgery, chemicals etc but I feel extremely lucky that after all of this, I will have a breast, and I will be alive! As for recovery, I'm not sure what to say... I have chemo and radio to do. My scar is totally healed and if not for the other treatments, I'm ready now for a permanent implant! I can lift, I can function, I can drive,  I sometimes need rest and can't do lots of things, for lots of days in a row, but I'm quite physically active at home as nobody seems to be able to do anything 'like Mam does it...!' Which goes from ironing, to dishes, to gardening, to playing ball with the dog and beyond! I hope my experience hasn't put you off, as I'm fairly happy with where I'm at. Many good wishes for your future choices and procedures,  Xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Chelseabun I can imagine that when you can see the finish line it could be very tempting to just throw off your caution and run like hell for the end! I can't really see mine yet so I can only imagine!  The way I see the two stage recon is that all of the big stuff is got out of the way first. The removal of breast tissue is both physically and mentally challenging. Once that is done, the second stage should , in theory, be just a tidy up job. If you need any revision etc, they can correct bits and pieces when they go in for the second time. The second op will require far less invasion, and the recovery time should be much much shorter.  Good luck, you're almost there!",

      "Content": "Hi All I've just read Kacang on another thread. (Sorry I don't know how to tag ) Quote: \"Also, I really didn't think I felt ill when I was diagnosed. However, now that I've been out the other side for several months, I realise that I wasn't really well for quite some time before diagnosis. Tired, listless, slightly breathless, lacking the mental energy to engage with anything. I'd put all the symptoms down to \"getting old\"; now I know there's no such thing and I feel at least 10 years younger.\"  What she just said rings quite true with me. I was always getting told 'you're turning old before your time' etc and didn't have any energy for anything. I used to be constantly planning little trips, days out, taking it on myself to rearrange furniture, decorate, clean. Worked overtime, couldn't stop! And then the last few years I've just done the bare minimum. I have wondered if this was the cancer getting a grip on me but my partner dismissed it, and I thought perhaps I was just imagining it (I think having cancer enhances your imagination skills!) but it worried me and I was thinking that I've got a long time left to be feeling this old.  I wonder if there's something in it, and if I will feel as Kacang does when I get through this? Is this a 'thing'? Does anyone else feel similar? Food for thought indeed!",

I am extremely careful as my armpit is completely numb after surgery for sentinel node removal and then full axillary clearance. As luck would have it, my chemo has taken the underarm hair away. Sadly, not the leg hair! X",
