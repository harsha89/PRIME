    "Content": "The hospital gave me flamazine on my final rads appointment as my skin had completely broken down under my breast and arm pit.  I have been using it twice a day for 5 days so far and it hasn't made any difference yet.  I let the air reach me at every opportunity and even sit with my armpit out of the car window to see if the air helps heal.  Could it be applied more than twice a day as you can only use it for seven days then it has to be discarded? Is there anything else that may help as I am just about fed up of being so sore! Julie xx Enter your message...",
