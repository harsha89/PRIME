      "Content": "Hi I have had four sessions of Docetaxel or Taxotere and My consultant suggested I used the cold cap. I have stage IV lung cancer with secondaried in my bones. My hair was short as I had been on a targeted therapy for 23 months, which stopped my hair from growing and made it curly, like a lot of post chemo hair. So far I have lost very little hair, another 2 sessions to go. It has grown quite a bit and I am going for a trim tomorrow as its getting difficult to handle!I wet my hair and spray it with conditioner before the cap goes on.It does add to the time and I do long to get it off and out of the door, once my chemo is finished! It is a bit painful for the first fifteen minutes or so but painkillers can be used.I read on the label attached to the machine that its a 70% chance of keeping hair when used with docetaxel or T as you call it. My oncologist felt it gave the option of not losing hair and therefore not having people know about it if you don't want them too if you don't want to wear a wig, or have children at home.He is a caring man. There is no cure for me only palliative treatment so I tend to try anything. Very best wishes Julie",
