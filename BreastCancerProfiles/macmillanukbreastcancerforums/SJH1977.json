      "Content": "Hiya, I wasn\u2019t given the choice but I think if I had wanted a different option my surgeon would have considered it. I did a bit of research before and felt the mammoplasty would be great for me (and give me better boobs than I started with ) and I might be wrong but I think the other option might give a longer recovery time? I had my op Monday and popped into work Wednesday - it was much better than anticipated!! Hopefully someone will be along with more info about the other other option. Being given a choice is hard - I just need to be told what to do!!! Good luck lovely xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Foxglove (my first ever post so I hope it works!)  I had the therapeutic mammoplasty - to be honest I am delighted as it\u2019s turned my saggy boob into the boob of a teenager (the words of my surgeon!) and she will match up the other one next year after all of my treatment is finished. The op was super straightforward although I needed a cavity shave due to unclear margins - much less pain than anticipated and I have full range of movement despite having ANC as well. I guess it depends whether you are happy to go smaller or not???  Good luck xxx ",
