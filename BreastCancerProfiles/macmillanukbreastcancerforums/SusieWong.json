    "Content": "Hi Penny, Really sad to hear your news and like everyone who has responded previously this is a very good place to come to sound off - asks questions and just really let it all go. When I was first diagnosed with Leiyomyosarcoma (Soft tissue and Bone cancer) I went to a day group for cancer patients, the experieince was a bit surreal for me at the time as I could not really believe I had got it, but I remember to this day one of the regular cancer patients who visited the group said to me that I should always remember the following and also say it out loud to my reflection in the mirror \"I have the cancer and the cancer doesn't have me\". I say these words, almost everyday (although there are some days when you get bad news from you specialists that was unexpected but once the news has sunk in I am back there saying it, it sort of gives a sense of you being in control and stops you mind going ballistic with random thought. Anyway if you feel like it try saying it to yourself - you never know it may help you to get on with your life and also try to remember to keep things in the day and not go off on the \"what if\" trips too. Hugs going to you. SusieWong XXX",
