I have been told that i will have to apply to the primary care trust for special funding as i have already had an implant exchange after mastectomy but due to the radiotherapy the skin wasn't stretched enough.They say they will do the nipple reconstruction though but I feel guilty for not feeling happy with the way things are.",
