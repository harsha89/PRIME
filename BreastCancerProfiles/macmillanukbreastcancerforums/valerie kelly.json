    "Content": "Hi Joanna, looks like you have thought of most things. I was told to avoid makeup and perfumes etc., but I have been fine and even wore false eye lashes. I have Shellac nails and no problems, although my nails are discoloured underneath, at least I still have them. I was told to keep toe nails and finger nails covered with nail varnish (not acrylic) all the time, the darker the better and keep out of the sun. Luckily we haven't had any sun and my nails are fine, just a bit rough and bumpy.   You can use the baby shampoo from now and conditioner, but the FEC treatment usually means you hair comes out unless you try the cold cap which is placed on the head half an hour before treatment. I refused it due to the coldness and the extra time to sit around while waiting for chemo. I think mouth ulcers are gonna happen no matter how hygienic your tooth care and its good you have the mouthwash ready. The mouthwash the hospital supplied is really good and stops the ulcers almost immediately. I was advised to use 'simple' deodorant. You willalso need a thermometer to take your temperature regulary. If it gets to 38 you have to go into hospital. Luckily mine has only reached 37.5 so I have been ok, but the day I overdid things, my blood count dropped too low for my next chemo, so you must take things easy, shop on line, get friends to help. Most people are really pleased to be asked to help as they feel totally useless and want to help. On a positive note my hospital offered free head scarfe training and a makeup session. Some places offer reflexology, massage and other services, so ask your mcmillan nurse.   During chemo you have chance to chat to your nurse and ask anything. Take someone with you for your chemo, you really will need support and it is so good to have someone there. There are so many side effects and everyone is different. I felt like I'd been beaten up after my last session, but when I got over it I felt great.  I did get depressed and am on antidepressants just to get me through the chemo.  I have one FEC to go and then 15 days of radiotherapy. My family and friends have been amazing. Do take all the help you can get and let yourself 'be ill'. It is really hard for me to do nothing, but somedays I can't even walk as the muscles are useless.  Other things are that it has affected my eyesight so things are blurred and my brain so I can't multitask anymore and this is really frustrating. I also drop everything I pick up. It just falls from my hand. I also get very hot sweats and then freeze. It is all very scary, but now I am nearing the end I am so relieved and can't wait to get back to work.    You will read all sorts of things, but I have never been told to avoid any foods and just eat what I fancy. I have started drinking coffee after 30 years of not touching the stuff and hate tea now. Thats because of the strange taste in my mouth. Chocolate makes me feel sick and I want to eat carbs as it helps with the sicky feeling.  Each time you see your oncologist he/she will modify your drugs and it is trial and error before you find the anti-sickness ones which work for you. I am also always told to walk everyday, but when you feel sick, you don;t feel like walking or exercising.   Glacier fox mints and murray mints have helped me especially when going to bed at night. There are also councellors available to help when you are scared, just ask. Everyone at the hospital is so lovely.   Take care. Val          ",
