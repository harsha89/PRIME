Now that you have had a first run, and you know you are about to embark on No 2?! I just find it a little unnerving just now...  Sorry - think my wires are being overdosed by steroids!  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "hey Rebecca, I am now 4 days into my first cycle of chemo. And I have opted against the cold cap, because I just couldn't be fussed with the trauma of holding on!  I am also loving my showers just now - I feel a real need to feel fresh, and so i am showering - using shampoo and just going about life as much as normal. I guess, if you are trying to keep your hair, then you need to stop with all the hair care whilst it is still there...  I am enjoying seeing my short crop in the mirror, as I feel I know it's just a matter of time.  Wig is not an option for me, just doesn't feel right to me, and I heard they may become itchy when the scalp feels sore as well. I opted to go shopping for head scarves - and I must admit I splashed out: went to All Saints! Nice, elegant, feels very comfortable! And then there are endless websites, where you can see how to drape the scarf around your head - I expect, as a model, you will already be well informed and able!  Bottom line: go with what feels right! Don't be brave, and don't be miserable! there are enough reasons for misery without adding anything extra. ;)  As for the chemo: they only need to reach your arm, and your BP. I'd advise on remembering a book and your iPod! Mine took 2 hours (at home) and I was soooooo bored! lol Dorothee xx",

Then you have a guide as to how you felt, and what you did about it.  When I felt sick I nibbled on Arrowroot biscuits! That seemed to settle things. Apart from that there are very useful anti sickness drugs about, which hopefully you are going to get prescribed next time round!  Well done for having started bootcamp! One down!!  Dorothee xx",

And I cried uncontrollably in London Heathrow, whilst waiting to check in. And I didn't care what anyone around me thought of me. I just needed to let it out. I was so scared.  And then, once I got more information, about treatment and time-frame, I started to fall into a mode of 'let's get on with it'.  It's all about information, I think! Then we have an angle to go and fight!  Lots of love and hugs Dorothee xx",

As if it's not stressful enough to have to go and make those appointments in the first place!  And, once we know what needs to be done, it really is a case of lets just get on with it, doesn't it?!  I couldn't see my oncologist soon enough in the first place. At the time I had found my lump and got my referral from the GP, there weren't enough oncologists around. One had left and hadn't been replaced. So the workload got split between the two who were left, and the waiting list increased! - But I must admit, nobody got shirty. That is really unfortunate.  But it sounds like you are on your way now to get hooked up and get started. Glad you have found us here for support.  All the best on your way through bootcamp!  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "hey Fretty, I feel I need to put a little word in edgeways, as I am reading Sandra's well meaning words. I am all about holistic! Because not only has our body taken a beating, but so has our mind, our soul! And I reckon the medics are wonderful at putting the treatments out there for our physical recovery. But our mental wounds are gaping wide open during the process, and usually long after.  I wholeheartedly agree that we need support in mending our mental, psychological bruises and wounds as much as the physical aspect. I am very much looking at active peer support in my community for just that reason. Because it is bloody tough going it alone!  But, unless I am totally misunderstanding Sandra's message - I do not believe for one minute, that your cancer has returned because you have been emotionally unwell before. I would even go as far as saying, that tack doesn't help! I don't believe looking at past traumas, when you are dealing with present ones is necessarily the right time. And feeling guilt about not having addressed past issues just now just focussed the little energy you have, all in the wrong direction.  You have done nothing wrong, and this is most probably just sheer pot luck! It bloody sucks!  I think I made my point. Sorry, to be so direct today.  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "hi Andrey, you have my deepest sympathy. Not being physically close, and having a different health service local to your mum-in-law makes everything much more difficult.  It is such a shame that she hasn't felt able to confide in you much sooner. I am sure it will make you feel even more helpless right now, and possibly frustrated for time and opportunity missed.  You may however need to consider that your mother-in-law made her choice to protect her family, and she may only now feel that she is running out of steam to cope on her own, or running out of options to cope on her own.  My first port of call would still be your mother-in-law. I think you need to find out from her how she feels about her situation, and then you need to work with her.  Although this News is undoubtedly a very new and recent shock to you and your family, in actual fact, it isn't so for her. She has been living with her diagnosis now for, as you say, about 6 years. She will have put a lot of coping strategies into place for herself during this time.  I think what you need in the first place is a certain diagnosis! And I imagine she can have that over in Russia as well as over here. - I take it she is Russian, and so, visiting a doctor in her own home certainly is an advantage for her because of language.  Have you considered going over there, instead? I know this can be difficult for work etc, but maybe she could do with someone over there who can come along to her initial consultations. To ask all the right questions, and make her see she is not left on her own.  Once you have a diagnosis, then the next step might be to have a chat about what that means to her, and what that means to you and the family. - Is she scared of die-ing, or is she scared of making you suffer?!  It would also then be a good idea to talk to the health professionals over there, to compare what they can offer her in way of treatment, and what she could expect over here.  It's not easy. My dad had cancer in Germany. And although that was a lot closer, in the end, the distance really was irrelevant. I was happy about the health service, but I wasn't entirely familiar with it. Bottom line though, we worked with him! In his situation. Asking all the way along,what he would like to do.  I wish you all the best, and like it's been said already, you may want to give the Macland nurses a call on this. They may give you some more concrete advice and support.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

But they are not necessarily more c-lumps.  I don't think I will ever get over the fear of finding lumps now. I fearfully search for any, and if I find something like an enlarged lymph node I find an inner panic rising.  I found my lump in April, and I have now done all the bootcamp and tanning. So, I feel I am out the other side of this horror story. But I am still waiting for the panic to ease.  Bottom line though, just like the first one - if you feel it shouldn't be there, or you are not sure, go see your oncologist, or your BC nurse or your GP, and they can reassure you.  hugs, Dorothee xx",

But, come Race for Life in June 2013, I entered the 10k. And I managed it, with puffing and panting, and running and walking.  I have been going out there pounding the pavements, buying shoes and lycra, and I have managed to increase the running times, slowly but very surely. From 3 minutes running interspersed with a minute walking, to running for about a half hour now. So, now I just wanted to share with you my huge pleasure: Yesterday I ran the whole 10k, start to finish! 1Hour 05 Minutes. Herceptin and heart tablet are long left behind. And I do feel I have more energy than I have had in a very long time! - well maybe not exactly today ... today I can feel every muscle! hahaha.  As some of you are struggling through your bootcamps and tannings at the mo, I would like to shine a little sparkle into your world of hopes and dreams for your future. It's sheer determination - all the way! So, here is to being determined! Dorothee xx ",

I am speaking of our lovely Annie40. Whom some of you may well remember very fondly.  Since Annie passed away a whole group of Macland ladies have come together, under the watchful eyes of Annie's husband, raising moneys for what is now becoming a non profit organisation. We are so proud to have had a massive fundraiser in this year's Race for Life. Apart from that we are selling wrist bands, hoodies, etc, and people are coming forward now to be raising moneys with their own challenges. It is amazing and quite humbling.  Now, though, we feel very much the responsibility on our shoulders of getting the next part right as well. And that is: How does this money best serve people like yourselves? Where are there holes in the system which provides your cancer care?  Is it a case of needing direct access to the money itself? What might you use it for? Or is it a case of providing a service, which the money can be used for, to cover running costs? A service, such as providing peer support in your community, or an information service, as to what is available already, but you don't necessarily know about it.  Please feel free to brainstorm with me/us. We so want to get this right.  Thank you Dorothee xx and the Annabel's Angels team.",

      "Content": "Hey Carla, Yes, it can be very confusing.  Let me start by saying: no cancer journey is the same, because we are all different in the way we live, in the way we respond to treatments and in the way our body and mind is able to cope. There are also many different types of cancers, so even when they look the same from the outside, they may well be different in their make-up and ability to cause havoc.  And then you do get different medical teams around the country and internationally making different choices on treatment.  There appears to be a pretty common theme though: the more aggressive the cancer cells multiply, the more aggressive the treatment. So, if you are graded at 3, then you are more likely getting chemo offered. And then there is a size issue: if it's small and local, then you are less likely getting the whole works.  So, it really seems individually different. And you need to work it out with your medical team, and with your family maybe, to figure what is right for you! Other people's 'stories' don't necessarily help you here. Hopefully you have a great rapport with your oncologist, and learn to trust his judgement. And then you always have a chance to tweak the treatment as you go along.  There is no hard and fast rule to this, there are professionals who know what they are doing medically. And then there is you, who has to benefit from the treatment, both medically and very much emotionally. And it is the emotional battle which seems to push us to our limits more than anything.  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "Hey Babs, I haven't read any of the suggested literature, so don't know whether I am just going to repeat what has already been said.  My angle on this is that I imagine you are suffering with something like post traumatic stress! I think what we have experienced comes close to a car crash! Out of the blue, devastating, life changing! And then you are left with the scars, and you are meant to just get back into the car and drive on as if nothing had happened!  It takes some people years and years to get through such an ordeal! And the first step to recovery seems to me to be the acknowledgement that we are not able to function and cope as we think we should.  I am wondering whether you live with fears and threats, which you may not even be totally aware of, but which haunt you during the night, and which leave you feeling uneasy. If that is the case, then maybe they need addressing, so that you can relax again in your own skin, so to speak.  This post traumatic period is a time to readjust, isn't it?! Finding your own confidence again, trusting your own body again to do what it is meant to be doing: supporting you to LIVE!  I'd go to the GP with the suggestion of PTS, and see what his suggestion is to tackle that.  Dorothee xx",

And so much waiting to be done to figure what exactly the medics are dealing with, and only then will you start to get some idea of what your treatment plan will entail!  Good News is though, that Breast Cancer in most cases is treatable! The research is so far advanced these days that the treatment gets to be very specific, very targeted. And the chances of making a good recovery are very good!  I am glad you have found yourself here amongst us. People here really do know what it's like, and more so they are living examples that it can all be done! It's gonna be tough, but it's doable!  My suggestion for now: Take it one step at a time. Don't look at the massive mountain which needs to be climbed, look at one step at a time. And that means, concentrate on meeting with your medical team, learn to trust they know what they are doing, and hand over control to them.  Any questions, and rants, all is welcome! And it will hopefully help you get to grips with what is happening.  Big hugs,  Dorothee xx",

I am just running my 3rd round, also FEC.  I don't like water, so that's a no-no, but, the first few days peppermint tea, and fruit teas with honey seem okay. So is flat coke.  Milk is the main ingredient for me during week 2 - loads in teas and cereals. Remember, eating a bowl of cornflakes, which is nice and bland, with a heap of milk will make up fluids, too.  I also use cordials, but when I do, I just put in a tiny amount to flavour. And then I go for del Monte dark juices, but you can't get them everywhere any more. Might have to hunt those out in smaller shops.  Hope that helps. But, yeah, it is a struggle!  Dorothee xx",

When all of this is terribly new, horribly real and yet you have no idea about anything.  I remember spending the night after my diagnosis on my sofa, just shaking and crying. As soon as I got a date for my op, though, things began to change. that resilience in me started to kick in, and I started to feel less vulnerable, and more in control.  The doc wouldn't start on any treatment though, until he had all the results back and got the whole picture of me. That was a try looooong wait. And it felt like the cancer was spreading every second to new areas in my body. - That is not the case. Yes, it spreads, but not half as fast as we think it does. So, let them make all the assessments first, it's worth it in the long run. And then go for chemo! Loads of us are going through it just now, and there is plenty of support here.  Dorothee xx",

Go see your GP and find out whether the x-rays can be speeded up?  In the meantime, maybe the good old fashioned hot and cold bathing might stimulate the blood flow.

But NOOO! Get the wellies out, extra socks on and go for long walks!  Diet on it's own just doesn't work, ladies, not in the long run. You cannot starve your body off food, because all it does is go into famine mode, and then at the end of it it compensates by putting it on even more. And all the weight lost is usually water!  Now for real fat loss you need to 'burn' the fat. And that is done with exercise, not dieting. All the dieting weight you will otherwise loose is muscle! And that will make you feel weak. And to build muscles you need to eat proteins.  Sorry guys, you probably all know what I am saying. And I know its not straight forward to loose the weight.

And since you have been there once before, I think all that scary feeling from the first time round just comes straight back to haunt you once more.  Lets look at this though: You have got pain, and you are feeling lousy. That's not a good state to be in! And from your oncologist point of view, he will be looking at this from the perspective of: it's not Nothing! So, let's figure out what we are dealing with.  Our worst nightmare is 'it's spread', that's why that comes in as not only our first reasoned choice, but our only one! And yet, there are other good reasons out there! All this medication can well be playing havoc with your body.  Your doctor is not necessarily anticipating serious problems, but neither is he gambling! He is just very good at his job! Get it looked at asap!  Yes, scary time. And it doesn't help that lovely people around you feel they want to be kept on the safe side of life, and they are willing you to be well! That's so not helping you! Because even if there is nothing physically to be found, your reaction of your fear shows that you are feeling very vulnerable, and very fragile in your soul and mental well-being! And it's not all about bones and bits and pieces, it's about your well-being!  I am so sorry you feel you are not able to share your worries at home. You certainly can here! You have every right to feel how you do, and you need support in this, rather than trying to support an air of wellness! Be yourself! Be scared! But trust that you have medical people around you, who are doing their best to make sure they catch whatever it is as soon as!  We are all here, waiting alongside you! But in the end of the day, you need to know what's going on! If only to settle the fear of the unknown!  Dorothee xx",

And on top of that he said, it's been there for months and you may as well go on your holidays now, because we are not doing anything until we have the biopsy back, which will take another 10 days ... and then it took another week before surgery on top of that! VERY VERY scary time. I felt so invaded - and soooo ready to just go under the knife there and then and have it all taken out of me. And all I could do was go on holiday and WAIT! - Felt like shouting 'wait for what? Wait to die? If you aren't quick enough, then that biopsy thing isn't gonna help!'  But, I am still alive and kicking! It was the time on my holiday that I had reflections on my worries: I very consciously looked at why I was frightened, and I have come to the very conscious realisation that I love living! And that has become my mantra since! Finding a strong point within yourself, that hook, which you can pull yourself up on, that's important, and it's real! As you go through Boot Camp, you are doing that FOR YOURSELF!  As for 'being positive for them', I think you need to be HONEST - with them and with yourself! Honesty is least draining to your own well-being. And I was surprised how disarming my honesty could be to my loved ones. My mum is still so upset at having lost my dad now three years ago to cancer. And I first thought of needing to be gentle with her. But I have found, she is actually not just coping with my sense of reality, but she is also able to reflect on her own journey again with my dad, and it is helping her, too. Fear and pain IS reality to this shit! It needs to be dealt with, carefully but honestly!  And Sassy: I will be thinking of you tomorrow!!!! Like all the rest of us here!!!!

It seems a strange paradox: Giving up control in order to gain it.  Every day is different for me at the moment, both physically and mentally, and that's been the case now for months. And I can't seem to just say 'tomorrow I will ...', because tomorrow is unexpectedly a totally different kettle of fish.  I can see how you feel you are pushing people away - but then you are not pushing everyone away. Here for example you are opening yourself up very bravely and you are inviting others , like myself, to share a bit of your journey.  It's just, that you have to do this with a bit of control and a bit of personal space! I think the need for my personal space has increased. I feel myself reminded of dirty dancing: this is my space - this is yours etc.  I feel it is because we are so vulnerable in our own thoughts, that coping with others isn't quite so easy. When I have a good spell I am quite relaxed about others asking me how I am. Come the middle week of chemo though and you keep getting those texts .... I am ready to delete my contacts, even my mother! Maybe especially my mother, lol! It would be okay if she told me nice things, but she just texts, or calls and wants to know how I am - well, I KNOW how I am, and it's not good, and I don't need to be sharing that. I would be in much need of some positive stimulating alternatives!!!  I don't think anyone in their right minds should see your need for more personal space as offensive! I believe it is your natural body defence system kicking in hard to preserve energies for that internal battle, which, after all is quite draining. Keep battling! Dorothee xx ",

I imagine this medication is a bit like the pill. Some people put on weight with the pill. Problem with hormone induced tactics is that when the weight creeps up we don't much like it, because we live in a society where overweight is not much accepted. Slimmer looking is still so much more the in thing.  Apart from that, there are health issues which we are made aware of. But then, Tamoxifen is actually a kind of 'life-saver'. So, what will it be? I feel I am happy on Tamoxifen, because it is recommended by my specialists. So then I need to have a think about, what do I do about the possible weight gain. I will be as active as I can be, as healthy as I can be. Within reason, and within the enjoyment that I get out of it. Leading a healthy balanced life is exactly that: it's a case of careful balancing! Or juggling without dropping everything. But bottom line for me is: I have to see the advantage of it! Otherwise there is no point! Life is about living! Dorothee xx ",

Well, my thoughts are:  if you are weighing up short term grottiness with long term health prospect, then I would take the short term shit, have it done with and know I have done everything in my power.  However, if the question should be weighing up long term side effects/ long term damage due to having the last tax, then that's more tricky, because you have quality of life to consider.  It sounds like a good idea to have a long chat with your oncologist before you make up your mind. Maybe he can give you some idea as to how important that last tax is. Unfortunately we haven't got a crystal ball, so my thoughts are: get yourself informed, but then listen to your own body, and make the choice which feels right for YOU! Hope you find your way through this struggle.  Dorothee xx",

Since you have been given a mastectomy they are probably certain (hahaha, that sounds evasive!) that all possible affected breast tissue is removed in that area.  as for chemo, I know I was borderline. Whereas my surgeon said nothing needed doing, my oncologist insisted on the bootcamp approach. And I know how unsettled you must be feeling right now. It probably still feels to you like you haven't thrown everything possible at it, because when we hear cancer, we automatically associate that with chemotherapy as the choice treatment.  But take heart that your doctors know what's best for you! treatment has come a long way, and maybe the burden that chemo puts on your body would right now outweigh it's possible effectiveness.  Dorothee xx",

I had 6 cycles of FEC. It is what it says on the tin! It's not a walk in the park. But it is doable. And personally it's given me some peace of mind.  My decision was, under the circumstances of having very little control in any of this, that I would trust my medical team. And like your situation, my surgeon thought the tanning was good enough, but my oncologist wanted to throw the kitchen sink at it! And so we started throwing! - No regret.  Out the other end, I think we will always have this paranoia hanging over us. I don't think a day goes by when I don't frantically check for lumps, imaginary or otherwise. Having been moved into the category of 'it has happened', that curtain of obliviousness has lifted forever. We are so much more aware.  So, in the end it's the best choice FOR YOU which you have to consider! And no regrets! That doesn't necessarily mean going for the bootcamp option, it means digging deep, looking at your own pros and cons. There are no guarantees, either way. It's a tough one. And again, we are making decisions of great magnitude with our backs against the wall.  Talk it through with your family, and in the end, trust your own instincts, and your medical team!!  And if you go through bootcamp, then we are all here to support you every step of the way!  Dorothee xx",

And they could be carried around on the lymph system.  Having just read my own writing though, I am puzzled too: if your chemo has been successfully completed then there should be no more cancer cells around!  The other reason for keeping massages gentle is the healing around the site of your affected area.  Would be good to get more of a satisfactory answer though! I had the same problem with the local beauty salon after completion of the chemo cycle. I was told the ladies were not qualified to work on me for about 5 years. And I was having to look around for specially trained complementary therapists. You will be able to find those when you ask the BC nurse, or a cancer charity service.  Dorothee xx",

If that is the case, then scroll back a few pages on this discussion forum, because we have just had a long debate on how to loose weight on Tamoxifen.  It also depends on how much you WANT to loose that weight again. If you are happy the way you are, then, I think just go with the flow and buy bigger.  As an interim, you could buy in a couple of cheaper items in the short run. And box up those trousers that are a bit too tight. Put them in the loft rather than to the charity shop, and wait and see.  Dorothee xx",

Get yourself your Vit D! Lots of sunshine and a bit of fresh air.  Maybe just sitting out in the sun for a while, or a 5 minute round the block.  I think the answer to recovery from Bootcamp and tanning is Baby-steps!

I don't know if any of it helped.  But, now I must admit, I cannot see the thick obvious lines any more which showed the thickened veins. And I can fully extend my arm again.  I am actually now very very carefully starting to use some weights (and I am only talking the minims weight of 5 kg) to get some upper body strength back into my arms!

Sounds good, too, that you have got some anti depressants sooooon.  You are having to deal with such a mountain right now, take every little crutch along on the way!   Never mind sounding morbid, that's how you feel just now, and with very good reason. It is such a scary time for you.  As for the lump not shrinking - it's only the first dose though you have had. And you don't know what it may have done to the other lumps. So much guess work involved. - Including your own perception of it maybe.  I remember thinking I am feeling my lump grow every minute of every day. When in fact the surgeon said to me it had already been there about 3 months.  Big massive hug, from a very wet and miserable Scotland. Keep fighting that shit! I think your body is doing exactly that - so there is nothing spare in the canister.  Dorothee xx",

This may be all routine to your doctors, but this is sooo not routine for you! And in general we do not flaunt ourselves in front of just anyone and get a kick out of it. And if we did, then it would be our choosing. We'd be in control. And we would have some alterior motive in mind ...  Your body has been violated as you quite rightly say, but so has your soul. Your whole equilibrium has been thrown out of balance when you have had to have your breasts taken off. And like hair, and figure, and BMI, these bodily parts give us reassurance as to who we are and who we want to be. We exude confidence when we feel happy and safe in our body. Some people even hide behind their body! I am so sorry you feel yourself dirty. Sounds to me you feel ashamed of yourself? And your self esteem has been taken down a few notches in the running, no doubt. Your op is still so very recent, and you are probably still trying to come to terms with it yourself. Bandages haven't come off until recently and before you know yourself, some stranger is looking at you, and worse touching.  You haven't had time to be introduced to your new you. And you are probably grieving the loss of the old you. And everything that penetrates into your inner sanctity of your new you hits you dead on and makes you see what you have lost. And you feel you have lost your armour! It makes you feel vulnerable and exposed.  Surely with time you will get to know your new you, and you will be building your confidence again. Slowly, in time.  But, in the meantime, there are options! I think it would be a really good idea to confide in your BCnurse with this problem. And don't you worry that you are not as important as other people around you! Your nurse can maybe talk to you about seeing a counsellor, but she certain;y should also be able to talk with your consultant about whether at your next consultation you can be seen by a lady doctor.  And then there are relaxation options, such as yoga, where you get to feel your own body again. Get to know yourself again.  And definitely share this with your partner. You will find it so much easier to deal with this with him, rather than on your own. He sounds to me like he is a very perceptive guy!  But don't feel embarrassed or ashamed! This is natural! Hell, I struggled losing my hair! And a chip out of my breast!  I hope I haven't made things worse here, but I am glad you have come to share!  How does the advert go - because YOU ARE WORTH IT!  Hang on in there, it does get better. And if the guy at least is good looking, then do some window shopping instead! lol Dorothee xx",

And it is as if you can't quite believe that you are lucky enough to still have her. - And then she throws the duck out with the bathwater, and she makes you feel vulnerable in your desire to be mum. In being mum!  That's why I was saying earlier: let go! by letting her go, you are much more able to keep her! Let go of your fears that this was all your fault. And let go of the idea that if you don't step up to her plate she will drop you! Or even worse, you would loose her!  Your daughter is a very lucky person to have you in her life!!! She is probably also scared, and overawed. But the best way of defence is outright attack! And the closest people to us are the ones we most likely attack!  Do you find you can go for coffee with your daughter and really have a heart to heart with her? have a girly time, and in that make her aware how important she is to you. Otherwise, yes, leave her hanging dry might just sober her up a little and stop her from taking you for granted!  As for your partner, my thoughts are, he is not only not her father, so there are issues there. BUT, he also is YOUR PARTNER! and he loves you! He loves you despite the all the mess, and family you come with. But, his priority of caring would be YOU!  He sounds to me like he is letting your daughter and her partner get away with much, because it appears to make you happy! But in the instance now, it no longer makes you happy, and so he steps in from the point of view of loving and caring for you!  Yes, a counsellor sounds like a good idea, but I think really talking to your partner, appreciating maybe that his caring is for you, might help the two of you master your side of the story! Your daughter has to manage her own!  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

AS I say: Blue Peter, take note!  Yes, tattoo: but none of your choice, just a couple of tiny dots.

Personally, I was very fortunate that I didn't work at the time, and I didn't have to.  Within each cycle of bootcamp you are most likely to get a 'week 3'. That's the week when your bloods come back up to normal, and you feel you are rid of all the poison in your body.  My worry for you as a head teacher would be: infections! Your lovely little darlings are going to bring all sorts of bugs every single day of the week. So, on days of low immunity, that might cause some worries.  My second worry would be: chemobrain. A VERY medical term for basically closing shop upstairs once you have had the chemo. In the short run I would imagine that thought processes and decision making might be lagging a little.  However, you might just be one of those people who is able to cope with your side effects.  In the ideal world you might be able to go part time. Go in when you feel fine, and have duvet days when you don't. 4 months do sound a very long time right now. But actually, it is not, and you are going to be very busy getting yourself through bootcamp. If you can take the time off, I would do it! Give yourself time really look after yourself. And take work home for the days you are able.  Good luck.  Dorothee xx",

And if you feel your wife is different, or you feel that you are not happy with what's going on, then you are in the very best position to be challenging the situation.  Sometimes the worst person to ask is the one who is directly treated, because they may not even realise changes themselves!  I think by the time that you are married/live together for centuries, you stop being two individuals, and you become one entity with two bodies! And just as much as you would know when your right arm hurts, or twitches, you know when things are 'not quite right' with your OH.  It may just be that you both need reassurance by the medics. But you certainly don't have to just put up with what's given and decided! You guys need to function! And if you don't then the medication as prescribes is not right for you! And changes need to be considered!  I would ask your lovely wife, whether she would mind, if you both make an appointment together at your doctor's. And if she agrees then I would have a chat with her, before you go, and explain, why you think you'd like for her to be checked over, so she is not caught off-guard in front of the doctor.  But once you are both there, then you both have chance to ask the questions, and you both have each other to chat about the conversation, and what that means for you both.  Dorothee xx",

As much as it hurts you, and it hurts your daughter, the couple of them need to sort themselves out! Bank of mum and dad at their age isn't a long term solution. And it seems that you are close to having communication problems with your partner because of their issues.  I imagine you feel guilty, possibly thinking you have something to do with where your daughter has got to. But, realistically, the choices she now makes as an adult are HER choices. And you need to learn to LET GO! Love and care, yes, but not be responsible!  They became reliant on you as well, and so the choices they made to cope were not coping strategies to overcome the deep problems, they were coping strategies for the short term.  I feel for you, as you are torn, because you feel your daughter is resenting you. And she may well throw a paddy, but then that's not an adult adult relationship! And that makes me wonder whether there is a possibility that your daughter also has huge problems coping in this situation.  There is a first stop SHE should take probably at the Citizen Advice Bureau. They would be able to advise her financially and socially. But, she has to mean to make changes for herself!  This is absolutely not your responsibility! They are grown ups!!  And yeah, Tamoxifen sucks! And when we are tired we are much less in a position to fight the fights! It's easier to just give in, isn't it. For peace and quiet! But, you know yourself, in the long-run this way just keeps biting you in the bum, over and over again!  Big hugs, Dorothee xx",

Dissolve a bit of table salt in luke warm water, and gargle with that. Swirl it around your mouth. Do this maybe twice a day.

And you may just want to spend time quietly. However, I change of wallpaper, watching the grandkids play, there is a lot to be said for that.  I am wondering whether you may have the option of letting your kids and grandkids go on this holiday, and you join them if you feel fit enough to do so. Go just for a couple of days, see how you get on.  Problem with planning anything during chemo time is the fact that your bloods might not play game. And then your anticipated weeks get swallowed up because it is taking your body longer to recover! Might not happen, but you'd be better off preparing yourself to be flexible with your activities.  I really do like the idea of getting out when you can. It does your soul a world of good. Just be careful, and pace yourself a little.Remember, once you are out the other side of bootcamp you can enjoy your holidays again much more easily.  Dorothee xx",

By the looks of it, it would have come out much more radically around the sides, as opposed to the top of the head - really the other way round to the way men lose their hair. So that wouldn't have looked cool.  My greatest worry in retrospect was, that I was so scared that I wouldn't recognise myself after - and that's just not the case. I am relieved to say, it's still me! But I don't have the trauma of watching it go every day and worrying myself. I picked out hair from my head like picking flowers in the garden.

I KNOW I will get upset when the day comes and it all falls out! I have been to see my hairdresser, and she assured me I only need to give her a call and she can go shave it all off. I don't fancy the trauma of prolonged losing.  My motto is, feel inside of me: how do I best cope, what is important. And if I change my mind, then that's part of the course, too. Dorothee xx",

So, if it causes havoc in the lungs, its like felling the old trees, without being able to plant the new ones just yet, and all you are left with is fallen wood on the ground. And walking through that mess is REALLY hard - and you get splinters, too!  So you are going in to get a clear-up operation going! Nothing wrong with that! - just 'bad timing' as ever with this fight!  Lots of love Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "hey Trudi, Good advice from the lovely ladies!  I would like to add another angle. One that I keep making comparison with: pregnancy and childbirth. Please bare with me!  When we give birth, initially we are very good at getting up through the night. Part of the reason is: adrenaline! the newness of it all makes us sit up and we are extra vigilant.  And then, as routine sets in, suddenly your kid starts teething. And then it gets really difficult. Who has the energy still to keep getting up through the night? Is it his turn or yours? ...  You see, I think we have a similar set-up here during Bootcamp and Tanning! In the beginning we cope. And then slowly but surely we get drained of the usual energy, never mind the extra bit of adrenaline! We just run on empty! And that is exactly where you are finding yourself right now.  You have managed to keep going so far, and undoubtedly you will find the extra push to make it all the way. But now there is nothing spare in the tank. And as you are sat on empty with the little yellow light flashing on the dashboard, you have doubts, not only whether you make it all the way, but whether maybe you are not as safe as you were hoping and trusting yourself to be!  Your trust in yourself and in your body has taken a big dip. And now that you are nearing the end of treatment the thought is starting to creep in that you are now left to your own devices on this again. Funnily enough, within the routine of Bootcamp and Tanning, we start feeling safe! We are proactive in fighting back. And you are starting to see the end of that now. Which gives you a sense of insecurity.  So, put the insecurity feeling and the lack of energy together, and you are just struggling. But people like your sister don't see your inner self, they see what they like to see, especially when you put on your make-up and try and cope!  From here on in I would prioritise! You know you are limited with your energy, so do what you feel you want to do, what you can cope with. In your time and your space! You do not have to justify yourself to anyone but yourself!  Dorothee xx",

I have cried and cried at Heathrow airport the day after my diagnosis, as we were off on a planned holiday. I am very fortunate that I have a wonderful husband, who just took it all. And then, when I had cried enough, I found space for strength again. To start focussing on what was coming up.  Well done for having taken the first hurdle already. Now, just take it one step at a time. All this stuff is very draining, and I don't think we feel very much in control during chemo. I call it bootcamp - there is a taskmaster in charge and he puts you through your paces from now on. But remember: fight the cancer, not the chemo.  Don't go google, because you can get yourself seriously frightened. But have a look at the info provided here by MacMillan. And maybe give the nurses a call here. They are very well qualified to give you some more info on your triple neg diagnosis.  There are a lot of folk here who are doing what you are doing just now. And there are people like myself, who have finished the bootcamp and the 'tanning'. And I think we are all good adverts for the fighting spirit in us and the determination that this little shit is not going to get us!  Hugs from afar, Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "Tiredness comes with the job description of what we are doing/have been doing! Like Kate says, best to acknowledge it, and give in to it. \"Because you are worth it'! lol Seriously, though, your body and mind have been tormented, and you have been zapped off every ounce of energy left in your body.  You use energy to heal!!! remember, your treatment has broken down parts of your body in order to get rid of nasty c-cells. Now you are needing time to mend! And the mending process is going to consume any energy you still are able to provide.  I imagine you will feel quite vulnerable as well just now. We don't have much of a thick skin left at the end. So, be aware and don't worry. It is totally natural. We'd like to be super-human, but we do face the fact that we appear to come to our limits after all.  So, rest is good. But so is fresh air and going for walks. You might find that resting during the day makes it more difficult to sleep through the night. That's where I would go for walks, do a bit of exercise to make the body physically tired. It's a different kind of tiredness to the lethargy I think we come to feel. Just slowly reintroduce your body and your mind to little challenges, which are achievable and which will make you feel good about what you have done.  Problem I came to at the end of bootcamp and tanning was a feeling of 'no future', no planning, no direction. And that seemed to zap energy as well. I found myself little achievable goals, which were not pushing me to any limits but gave me the start of a feeling of direction, progress, hope and future again.  Lol, this is getting seriously deep here ...  Dorothee xx",

And I had great fun with my 'kids', mostly bribing them to even throw the mower about. My daughter and her boyfriend got really stuck in, when they were about. But as they are students, living in Glasgow, that really wasn't anything much more than occasional weekends.  My sister-in-law came to make a difference and I ended up taking her to casualty with a grass blade cut on her hand!  My suggestion is, find a little army of helpers, kids like to earn pocket money, and older blokes like to show they can 'bench'! So, if you are feeling well, then make it an event, get the BBQ out.  And then go buy a really lovely garden bench, in anticipation of a much much nicer summer than we are getting a winter just now.  Dorothee xx",

I would note it down in a diary though, and also whether you feels it's heavy, and how long it does bleed. Then you have much more of a reference to talk with your doctor.

      "Content": "hey there,  yeah, it's shit! No two ways!  A diary is a very good idea, because as you go through the next cycles of 'bootcamp' you can make comparisons, makes it easier and is sort of reassuring.  Problem with chemo side effects is, everyone gets them, but until YOU get them yourself, it's difficult to explain what it feels like. Just like being steamrollered!  Really important to drink plenty, they say at least 2 litres, to flush the stuff back out of your system. And when it come to food, I would go with what you feel like. Your body will tell you exactly what it needs and what it won't cope with.  As to feeling guilty - well - dumb of me to say 'don't'. I think it's possibly your fear and your frustration hitting you. And again, the chemo poison breaks down your defences, both physically and mentally. It does so for all the right reasons, but it makes you more susceptible to feeling weak.  Maybe, taking your daughter's love and embracing her unconditional need and love for you, may just help you. There is a lot of positive energy that flows from your relationship with her. Take it, it will do you good.  And dragging yourself out fir little walks, even if it's just 5 minutes round the block, I think fills your lungs with fresh air, and gives you a feel-good factor.  And as for the washing machine ... you gotta laugh! Scream first, then laugh - it never rains, but it pours!  and then get people to rally around you to get your washing done next door.  Just think: ONE down!!!! It's a good start!  And, maybe make a call to your BC nurse, and check out whether all your pains are within normal limits. No point suffering needlessly. It may reassure you too.  Big hug,  Dorothee xx",

But there are loads of us here, who have got past the beginning, and who are still here, and are sharing so inspirationally how they have been coping, or not coping.  The treatment for BC is incredibly good these days. So from a physical point of view, i think you are in the most capable hands. Yes, it's tough, but there is medication to stem sickness etc. What you are going to struggle with more probably is that you are entering, as you already realise, an emotional roller coaster. And getting emotional support out there is really tough. I think this is why this group here is so very inspirational. You can draw from others' experiences. Peer support.  As for work. That's shit coincidence indeed. But, unless you are absolutely dependent on your income, maybe it is possible to look at it from another viewpoint. It gives you time to focus on yourself, and your immediate needs for your own well-being.  The whirl is going to settle, once you are on the road of treatment. It's the waiting beforehand that is going to torment you and test your patience. but it is very important to give the team all the time to get your diagnosis right.  hugs, Dorothee xx",

So healing would be very slow progress, even with keyhole.  You really are in a predicament with this just now. I am so sorry.  Have you had a chat with your oncologist about the potential damage caused by giving the chemo a break? Is it as bad as you fear?

Also unfortunately, even though you have finished your tanning (well done for that!), the actual radiation is going to carry on for I think a couple of weeks. - Bit like a microwave, you are meant to me leaving your food  to stand a little longer, because it is still doing it's stuff.  Part of your discomfort may just be that you are unsure about your pain, and about progress. So, if your doctor can reassure you, that all is well, then maybe you are able to relax a little into your new situation.  Apart from that though, I don't believe that suffering with pain quietly is an option. So, I would find out, what pain killers you are able to take.  And then I imagine it is a 'be patient and wait' game again. I am sure it will get better, as the rib cage can start to recover from the recent onslaught. - Wouldn't think it will go fully, as my rib cage does feel different still, and I finished tanning on Boxing Day of last year.  Good luck - and if nothing helps, resort to wine and chocolates!

But, you are half way!  I am not entirely sure whether your struggles are with the physical chemo drugs and body reactions, or whether you feel you cannot cope with it mentally any longer.  I reckon the discussions with your team will be looking at either or the other category, or a bit of both.  Medically, your Tax is going to give you a different experience, I imagine, to the FEC you have just gone through.  Emotionally though, you may not distinguish the two different ingredients of your cocktail, and you just feel burnt out. - And in that case, you may find it helpful to tackle your support system around you! Can you afford not to work just now? Can you afford to go and find complementary therapies, yoga, time-out, just to pace your self.  There are counsellors you can talk to, and drop-in centres where you can go and just get a change of scenery, and a friendly face you can make you a cuppa!  If your discussion is about what happens now, if you decide you cannot cope with another chemo, then for starters, you have done 3! That's pretty cool! 3 is already 3 more than none!  I guess your next considerations may include whether you can take Herceptin? What hormone tablets may be suitable? And what other options you may have.  Don't be too hard on yourself, though! this bootcamp business is tough! It throws you physically and emotionally in equal measures. Only, your onc has a big bag full of goodies for all your physical ailments, but there is nothing much in there for your emotional well-being!

I had been totally unprepared for this rejection, felt embarrassed to have even asked, and left with my tail between my legs. And then I asked my oncologist, who pointed me in the direction of my local cancer support centre. There are therapists, who are specially trained, as you don't want to upset your sylph system, and areas of operations. So these people are marvellous at treating you and making you feel relaxed and tonnes better. Often they are also really good at listening, so when you feel you need to pour your heart out a little more in the moment then they can catch you.  If you have something like a Maggies then that may be a good place to go and ask. But your chemo nurse or BCnurse should also be able to point you in the right direction.

And my tear ducts dried out so my eyes kind of got sore.  As your bloods are being checked all the way along, you know you are being looked after as best they can. But, you know you have your thermometer beside your bed, and if you should feel lousy, then don't wait about, but contact whoever needs to know so they can kickstart your antibiotics.  Only 2 more to go though!!  Dorothee xx",

You can call your GP in the morning and see if you can get slot, as a panicked cancer patient!  It may be nothing, other than having something like a stiff neck, because you have been lying awkwardly during the tanning sessions, or because you are sleeping funny as you are subconsciously protecting your upper body during sleep.  But it's nearly Christmas, and you may very well be anxious right over Christmas if you don't have it checked out.  We do tend to get paranoid quite easily, but that doesn't mean to say there isn't anything wrong. And the more you worry the more you anticipate the discomfort.  So I would absolutely get it seen tomorrow.  Hugs in the meantime,  Dorothee xx",

You have probably already been through the 'why me' stage.  Have you researched further into grieving stages? It might be helpful in order to break down your thought processes. If you can see how you have already progressed through some of your grieving stages, then you can actually see 'progress' when it looks like one never ending nightmare.  It can also show you that, as you have progressed already, there is no reason why you should stop progressing - and at the end of the grieving tunnel, there is light. It is there for you too.  '2 years on average' is pretty meaningless. Who is average? How long is a piece of string? It will take its time, but I wouldn't sit around waiting for 2 years to elapse. I would wait for longer, warmer days to pick up from winter blues.  hugs, Dorothee xx",

But, it only feels like an insurmountable wait just now. In the big picture, having to delay a week doesn't make any difference. Just prolongs the anticipation of this unknown entity called chemo! - Everyone says it's rough, but until you get started you don't actually know what rough means for you specifically.  On a note of Olbas and equivalents: Please, once you have started chemo, be very very careful using those meds!  You will find that the hairs inside your nose also go elsewhere to play, which leaves the lining of your nose for months on end like a silky baby's bottom! You will notice it run more easily, and probably bleed more readily. All this will recover once chemo is done. BUT, whilst it is so delicate, don't use harsh things like Olbas! It burns like crap!!!!

You need to inform yourself, and the google engine is a good method to use. Finding specific info is invaluable to our coping strategy. But what we should be aiming for is objective facts of info, provided by a recognised forum, be that Macmillan, or the NHS or the drug company itself.  I reckon when we say 'don't google', it means stay away from subjective comments: people's experiences, people's stories, and worst of all the stories you get in the daily somethings which are provocative, hurtful, frightening, just because they sell papers.  Dorothee xx",

I think we lost faith in the ability to help ourselves, after we have had to give up all control, because our body was invaded and was doing its own thing for a while.  It is this trust, that actually your body does know what to do, which we need to claw back for ourselves. However, it has done it! With the help of all the medical intervention.  And so there is no reason why it shouldn't keep on doing what it knows to do.  In all of this doom and gloom, you know at least that now you are on the medics' radar! If there is anything going wrong again, then they will know pretty quickly.  But for those of us who have done the treatment, and come out the other side, it is a slow and fragile walk to find your inner self again. The one that can trust in your own body, and in your own intuition.  Dorothee xx",

I asked whether the surgeon had cut nerves, and I had been assured that no major nerves had been severed. Still, the feeling radiating from the axilla to the chest feels different. At first it was like after the dentist! But feeling has slowly come back, just as the blue dye is slowly receding! My op was in May.  I think in the end, even if no major nerves have been torn, we have got nerves under the axilla, and those nerves will have been compromised. They will improve, but I think this was a price to pay for getting our life back!  I have full range movement of my arm. The restrictions are more with having the 'tanning' now - radiotherapy makes the skin very delicate. But again, a price I am willing to pay for getting my life back.  Dorothee xx ",

      "Content": "I am wondering, if you find you can sleep for up to 4 hours in the day, are you sleeping on the sofa? Are you, for now, more comfortable there than in your bed?  The other thing to be aware of is the rhythm of sleep: under normal circumstances I think most of us say we sleep all night, and that gives us probably about 7 or 8 hours sleep. HOWEVER, the sleep pattern is such that we don't actually sleep our deep sleep for a whole 7 to 8 hours. And we come to wake again at about 4 hours. And that is why, when you sleep in the day, and you relax properly, you get your 4 hours.  I got myself in a right state during and after all the treatments, because I expected to just sleep through the night, as, like yourself, I was exhausted. But then I found I would wake in the early hours, and couldn't get back to sleep. So I started fighting it, which made things worse! Fact is, even if we just lie and relax, then we give our body a rest.  But you are saying you are uncomfortable in your bed, and that is not relaxing by any means. Have you go yourself all the pillows in the world, which people get for pregnancy etc? It takes a while to get comfy again, but you will get there. It's still early days, and things need to settle back down again. Make sure you take your pain relief before you go to bed. And if you can, get into a nice relaxing bubble bath before bed, too.  And these are just the physical aspects of your dilemma. There may be gremlins lurking in the dark, when you have all the time and your mind starts to analyse what has just happened in the past few months. It takes time. But you will get there.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

And when the majority is in a celebratory mood, then it appears to wrong to feel a different range of sentiments. And then we feel guilty about how we feel, and we feel we are a nuisance and we are not pulling ourselves together.  But, realistically, we have been given all our emotions for all the right reasons. Provided free of charge by mother nature!  The reason we feel resentful, bitter, angry etc is because basically, we are in a position where all those emotions come to light! Recognising them, and appreciating how you are feeling is at this point much more helpful than giving yourself a hard time that you are not able to dig out the expected happy face.  And with that, my advice is to share how you feel! It makes it more real for yourself! Once you start writing it all down or share verbally, then it is out there and you can start working with it. Whilst your thoughts are all muddled inside of you, they just grow, like a bottle of bubbly about to explode, when you start unscrewing the lid.  Yeah, that bubbly has been shaken - but just keeping it still now won't really do the job.

I had a panic not long ago just before setting off on my hols!

And then you can't sleep and it get worse through the night and the husband, and then he falls asleep and probably infuriates you just because he is breathing ... Now, I have had those kind of nights myself!  I have ended up taking myself onto the cold leather sofa during a night, or sleep in the spare room. Just so I wouldn't wind myself up even more, and so I could give my OH a good chance to catch the sleep he really needed. It wasn't permanent, and it worked. Better than getting ratty in the night, thinking of ways to throttle him. lol As for the itching: you are doing everything I would have thought of. Try ice, try cooling your body down. Not wearing anything scratchy, just keep to cotton. But you probably already know that.  I would chat with your oncologist though about your side effects! Apart from anything else, I believe you need all your energy to be fighting your cancer cells just now, and atm it looks like you are channelling all your energy into not climbing up the walls. And you are getting sleep deprivation, and that's just fuels the whole disastrous problem!  Your chemo is meant to be helping you! It's not meant to be torturing you! See the difference? The torture is merely the side effect! And if you can work through this with more comfort but with just as much effectiveness, then you would be feeling much better in yourself!! Let your consultant in on your problems. He has your best chances of survival at his interest, and he knows how to best go about that! Don't second guess your options!

And so I started running.  It was then last autumn that I have started taking to the gym as I found the run outside treacherous and cold.  Bringing the upper body muscles back up to scotch is a tall order. Everything feels different, and muscles are just not there to support anything.  So, my suggestion would be, go for it, but listen to your body, go gentle, and don't have great expectations to begin with. You will get there, but it does take time, and you don't want to overdo anything and cause injury.  But, there is nothing quite like getting out there again, taking your life back into your own hands, looking for achievements and enjoying the exercise!  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "hey Karen,  I have felt a blip between chemo finish and rads start. It seems to be a period of time where we first come to a standstill after all the fighting. And we are making first self assessments... It does get easier again, or at least it did for me, when I started rads, because I felt I am fighting again. Keeping busy holding the devil at bay.  I am now done with rads as well. And I am okay at the moment. I get my moments, but I feel I have bombarded myself with all I could, and, I do trust in Herceptin!!!  So, it's a case of 're-normalising'. Learning the new normal. Learning that, yes, we have been there, but we have done it, and if anything: we are maybe at an advantage, because we are now checked over regularly, and we are aware.  I don't think I will ever go back to the carefree me from before. So, new me has to embrace what has happened and trust that the fight I have given it has been a good one.  Just also, maybe it is this time of year as well, we have been so busy with the run-up of Christmas. And now all the puff has gone out of the energy driven weeks. It's cold and dark and dull outside. That in itself can also drag you down.  Glad you are sharing your yucky feelings. Not a bad shout to just have a good old cry! Things usually look a bit brighter after.  Big hugs,  Dorothee xx",

You know you have that beast inside of you, and you are scared it is causing more damage as you wait for results.  The good thing is: in today's day and age there are so many angles, there is so much detailed information available to us now, that for many of us there is a really chance that we can beat this monster. - However, the medical experts need to take their time to really dig to the bottom of YOUR situation. No one person is the same.  I wish you and everyone else here from the bottom of my heart that you find you can truly trust your medical team! In that case, now that you are in their hands, they are going to do their utmost to get you back on the road of recovery! And you can trust that they are already doing so, even though you are still sat frustrated on your sofa!  The cancer cells, although growing fast in some instances, don't actually grow that fast! there is time to do this properly! Trust!  And then let go! - We are control freaks. We sort out the family, we run our lives, and then we suddenly come to this wall! Or as you put it this roller coaster! You have no option, but to get into one of the cars, and then it takes off - and all control is taken away! And not just control, but also predictability, and anticipation! You don't know what's coming next, you didn't ask for it, but jumping off is not an option either!  Sooooo, hold on to the ride! And just take every little bit as it comes. Don't look far ahead, just up to the next bend.  And then, use all your lovely people who are in your life to make this ride as comfortable as possible! That's the bit where you can take charge again. Let people know what you need, how you want to do this crap. Let them know how you feel, yes, bad times as well!  Acknowledging your bad times, I believe, gives you options to deal with those. You can spend time crying, throwing Plates (oh yesssss!! Very therapeutic) and then your brain gives itself the healing powers to buckle up again and have another go!  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

I have made contact with Mother Earth - Actually bloody concrete - twice since chemo! But then I blame it on the stupid cleats, which bolt your foot to the pedals! After the second fall, I have gone back to ordinary pedals, except they are purple now! Feeling much safer now! lol  As for the advice on the Tamoxifen, it keeps popping up again and again: try a different brand? Or else, try taking some Vit D, that apparently is meant to be really good for joint pains. problem with taking Brufen or similar on a regular I think may invite other issues, like stomach bleeds in the long run.  Good idea to go see your doctor about that.

The explanation behind this is that the hair follicles in your nose have gone, and there is no protection atm. It's just thin skin, which can easily rupture.  I was advised to use vaselin, but don't know whether that helped, because I don't tolerate much in my nose anyway. Just a word of caution though: do not use any nose drops - very tempting if you have a blocked nose! They Burn!! It's hideously sore!  My nose did recover after chemo.

Been there myself as we live in Aberdeen, and we get very long depressing dark winters.  I have had only a few lymph nodes removed, but, like yourself I am still finding there is a long thin muscle which seems to pull along the inside of the upper arm.  I am on about the same timeline as you. Found my lump on Easter Sunday! Had my diagnosis beginning of May and my op on the 19th of May.  As for the muscular pain in the arm, I do stretches. Always stretching against the pain, for as often as you can do and for as long as you can cope with. For example, running your arm up a wall, or holding onto the door arch above you. - But not stretching tooooo far, you want to make it feel like a stretch, not cause yourself pain or injury!  As for the gym - I have opted for regular walking instead. I have dogs anyway. But I have found chemo quite a tiring exercise, so going to the gym sounds to me too energetic. Apart from that, there are people with germs!!!!  So, combining your need for exercise and combatting depression: there is nothing better than good old proper sunlight and fresh air! - And you can make the walks as long or as short as you can cope with on any one day. And since you say you are supported by family: get them involved, take them out for walks with you. That way you are not walking alone, and you get time to chat with people. Also that way, you can say, when you are at home, and you don't want visitors, keep them to your walks.  Sending positive thoughts and light, Dorothee xx",

It's a tough time for you just now, and your responsibility as a single mum must be playing extra hard on your emotions. But, it is true, if you can, take a deep breath and just look at a step at a time. And your first step is to just find out what exactly is going on. So far you have done everything you can do, and getting an appointment for next Friday is not too long to wait. Find things to occupy yourself with maybe, so you can pass the time more easily. Maybe you can go treat yourself a little, and your son! - And if you cannot sleep, go find a girly book, and just sit and read instead of tossing and turning. And you can come on here any time too, and just say it as it is. I believe these things are better dealt with when you put them out on the table for you to see. Once you spill it all out, then you are aware of your worries, and then you can find ways of coping! It is just a case of finding how to cope again.

And as you must have been waiting for your son's results a year ago, it is not just the not knowing, but you feel you do know, because all your knowledge and recent experience hit you in the face. Just when you can neither fight nor run!  Our body and mind is prepared for fight or flight - it is not prepared to twiddle thumbs. It's what I call Shock, the inability to start dealing with your situation.  Once you know, then you can get yourself set up to do what needs to be done. But this is no-mans-land. A minefield and you are stood right in the middle of it.  From my experience the nights are the worst. Time when everyone is asleep, and you are exposed to thoughts, memories and anticipation.  I bought books. All sorts! Romantic trash. For me it was a case of looking for some escapism during that time. Other times I would just cry. Bawl my eyes out in the middle of Heathrow airport, as we were boarding a flight for a once in a lifetime holiday for our silver wedding anniversary! What a anniversary that turned out to be! We spent ten days away, as we were waiting for the results. It was hell on Earth, and it was also a very conscious period of my life. I was very aware of my experiences. And when I needed it I just cried, until I had cried myself out, and there was space again for hope and trust.  I do hope your boy is doing well now.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

So there might be a qualified background to him/her that this is more than an educated guess to them.  I have made a different experience though: my GP acknowledged my lump, told me that it was good I had come with it straight away, and he would make an urgent referral! So, my GP did not make the call, but I am sure he included it in his consideration.  My surgeon made the diagnosis 3 weeks later after he had taken biopsies and syringed fluid off it. And then it still took until the bugger was out, and was sent off for histology to really know what exactly we were dealing with.  Maybe there are dead set tell tale signs even to a GP that he can make such a call. It's huge, if he/she is wrong though!  Glad you are getting the referral, and maybe you can go along with your mum, and help her get through this next period of time, which is so filled with uncertainty and angst for her and for you.  Hope this helps a little,  Dorothee xx",

ME and cancer - I have no personal experience, but my gut feeling tells me you are about to enter very muddy waters, if you are trying to separate the two. As you say ME is all about exhaustion, well, maybe cancer treatment is another form of ME. I would just take one step at a time, and work closely with your medical team. I am also wondering about work: it can be tough going when you are going through Bootcamp. At the same time, it gives you a sense of normality, something to keep your head above water. Dorothee xx",

Is this worry just wearing you down, to the point that you are asking now, or do you have a specific symptom or result which you are not happy about? You also have the option of ringing up the nurses here on the helplines. They may be able to advise you, too, as to what is your best way forward from here. Hope you find peace of mind soon enough.

And I think they are a wonderful option and addition to the general treatments. Apart from the relaxation in the treatment, the ladies are solo good at listening. So you can just have a real good go at putting the world to rights again.  But also, just removing yourself physically from the 'frontier', getting away from it, gives you space and time to refocus, to let go.  And focussing on the getting away: retail therapy, even if you don't go buy anything. Or taking the weekend away. Just by yourselves. Pack the dogs and go walk along a long beach. Let the wind blow some of that headache out.  And believe that what you have chosen to do is the right move.

It makes you unburden, at least for a little period of time, to gather more strength for things to come. And, if you were lucky enough like me to have your husband there with you at your cries, then I believe it's good to have that intimate sharing time! (Not the one where everyone shouts 'get a room'!) Things are so scary for you at the moment, because there are so many 'I don't knows'. But you are on the road to better days already, having had some surgery out of the way - the crap they've removed can't touch you any more! And the next stage of figuring what and where is scary whilst you don't know, but in the long run you will know, and it seems 'better the devil you know'.   HER2 pos makes the cancer more aggressive, but also much better treatable. So, choose the good from the bad in that! I do! I am starting my 3 chemo on Thursday, got RT ahead of me still, Tamoxifen and the Herceptin. All stuff you are going to be meeting on your long journey too. But, don't worry about all that later on. Just go with what's happening right now in your life.

Your body would only be ready for the next onslaught after 3 weeks, sometimes maybe even after 4. So, 7 weeks is still very much the time that your body is experiencing the after effects of chemo. And you have got to just be patient.  Some effects may stick around for quite a while. Or they may reoccur: the twitching of the eye, that is something I get now off and on on my right eye. I guess it has something to do with changes from the chemo. And when the eyes get tired then they start straining, they get runny and they twitch.  Your body has been run down to bare minimum functioning. You feel exhausted in yourself, but all the little areas that make up your body have that same experience too. Each one needs to go through the recovery now. Slowly and gently.  You will get there.  Dorothee xx",

That's the stuff they put in to bulk up the drug to make it into a tablet.  I am now on my 2nd packet - so, nearly 2 months in. I went to Boots, as that seemed to have been a recommendation on this site, and they have given me 'Wockhardt'. I am absolutely fine on these, and am intending to stick with them as long as they keep on being fine.  Neither my GP nor my Oncologist had any worries of me taking it. They do not appear to see the same level of treat. - And so the benefits still  very much outreach the problems. I will go with this treatment for now, because I do want to give myself all the chances that are thought out for me by professionals, who have my best interest at heart. I must trust in their knowledge and their research. What comes along, will come along. And then I will deal with that. But for now, all is very well. - Hot flushes, yes, but then, I have had those since I started chemo, so can't blame that on the tablets. It's just the side effect of getting older! If we want to beat cancer, and any other diseases that stop us in our tract to enjoy life, then, I figure, I have to put up with some side effects. And so long as they don't interfere with my general thirst for life, I will gratefully accept. Dorothee xx ",

It does get hard around your scar, because that is the area that is being targeted.  Imagine a chicken breast raw, nice and soft. and then cook it! It's exactly the same.  I think what might be a good idea is what I had done: I was also very worried. Especially as I had found my lump myself, and found it by comparing one breast with the other. Since tanning, your two breasts are not going to have the same texture again, and I don't think they ever will. But, having spoken with mu oncologist about that, he very carefully 'showed me around' my new/old breast. Showing me, making me feel what it feels like and explaining why.  It's basically getting newly acquainted with your breast. But, I would be pretty certain that there is nothing to worry about.

      "Content": "hey guys, I have not had tax. I had FEC. My last one was in October. And today I went to my hairdresser's for the first time! What an outing! I was so nervous - I am very protective of my curls now. But they are kind of unruly and my hairdresser agreed that the hair is coming in at different lengths in different areas around my head. So she carefully thinned out at the back, but she didn't touch the top at all.  Made a huge difference. Even though there really isn't all that much to cut yet. And then she said I did have to pay anything. - Huge awe!! So so lovely!  Anyway, apart from it taking nearly 12 months from the last chemo, my tip of the day is: make a photographic diary for yourself. As most people have iPhones, it is easy to do selfies! Kepp them for yourself, dated, so that you can eventually see your progress. Because progress seems kind of slow and subtle, you might just get fed up with waiting. But when you look back and compare, on a 'bad hair day', it's good psychology to have the reference! Also, if you are brave, post the hair progress on Facebook. Let your friends be part of your regrowth. It will stop them asking stupid questions! And they may be full of admiration!  Dorothee xx",

Sounds like when I was pregnant, and we got the tour around the delivery suite weeks before. But maybe that's not a bad thing.

I also had 'tanning', and I am pretty sure that the radiation/toasting has gone right into the ribs! Fully fried, and the rib cage is still sore 2 years on. It has got a wee bit better, but as I am now exercising, I also find that building up muscles in the chest area just feels 'different'!  Unless it is really painful, which is limiting your daily activities, I have found I just recognise that the pain is there at times. And I am pretty sure I understand why. So, I am okay with that. It's like having my very own battle scar! A reminder of what things I have had to deal with.  If, however, you are experiencing pain you are worried about, or pain, which you are not really able to tolerate, then I would go back to your GP, and have a chat. You shouldn't be going through life in unnecessary pain! And sometimes just knowing what is going on makes the pain feel less severe!  Dorothee xx",

I ended up trying all sorts of juices, as I couldn't tolerate caffeine very well, and I just don't like drinking plain water. I used to make a chart every day of writing down how much I had had. Really trying hard to get to 3 litres, and failing miserably on several occasions.  I found though that a lot of what I experienced seemed to take me right back to the faddyness of pregnancy! and so I am wondering whether your sense of smell is maybe heightened as well just now, and you are experiencing much more of a bad smell, just like your taste buds are all over the place! I am sure your red dye can't be smelling the most lovely smell, but maybe your sense of smell is playing a little trick on you too.  Unless you are getting a burning sensation when passing urine, I wouldn't worry, and just go spray perfume around the room! - I have done that!

But then, maybe they couldn't. - I wonder if you could ask your consultant that question!  Is it inefficiency that delayed the findings of the further lumps, or is it greater efficiency, because the newly found lumps are much smaller, and they had needed to look at the scans in much more detail.  Does it make any difference to the treatment you have been receiving so far? Did they just do a couple of lumpectomies, and you are now looking at going to have another two removed on the same breast? Hope you get it sorted soon. I do feel for you.

Some people seem to cope better than others, and Tax is meant to be a tough one in the mix of things. So, very well done for coping so well.  My FEC didn't go to plan, and my oncologist basically had a think the other way round after No4, saying that in other countries it is quite the norm apparently to just go with 4. England and Scotland like to go with 6, if they can get away with it.  There has got to be a bit of give and take, I think. Because of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells, they like to throw everything at the body that they can, in the hope and trust it will irradiate everything. But on the other hand, there has to be a limit, when the body is no longer coping and is starting to self-destruct!  Sounds to me like your oncologist is saying your body is coping, so lets just make absolutely sure!  Good luck on the last ones. Each and everyone is bootcamp! But you are getting there!!! Good on you!  As for taste and texture. Sorry, can't help there either. Try pineapple, it seems to work with others too. It will get better again! :)  Dorothee xx",

A very good friend of mine posted on here a couple of years ago the phrase \"Upgrade\". Yes, indeed, we are upgrades. We have matured! We have come to see the light! Our choices are more deliberate, and our awareness has received a focus it hasn't had before.  So, you are aware and you are desperately feeling that things cannot go on as they have done. Am I right?  How well do you communicate with your partner? really talk! You were saying you are walking with your friend, but not with your partner. - I agree, when you walk you talk! there is no getting away from it, and you have time, and nowhere else to be. It's a really good place to be in. We have two dogs, and so we have that time every day, when we make time to talk. It's not always something important, and don't get us started on politics ... But it fuses us back together.  Relationships evolve! just like you have become an upgrade, your partner will also have gone through changes with the redundancy. He may well feel a failure, not good enough. and he may be hiding this from you my shutting you out.  You are both needing support, I think. But you may not be strong enough, either of you, to be supporting the other on your own. - I would go have a chat with your GP. I would suggest you have a chat about possible depression, possible post traumatic stress!!! See what your GP might then come up with.  In the mean time, maybe a little time away is not a bad suggestion. Doesn't have to be expensive. Doesn't have to be far. When was the last time just you and your husband went away for a weekend??  Start small! Start by putting music on instead of the telly. get a bottle of wine out, and chat! Or run a very lovely bubble bath! with candles.  Find some ME time, and try and find some US time. - Or find a good friend to have a good heart to heart!!! Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "hi sweetheart,  We are hearing you loud and clear! You are tired, you are in pain, you have lost yourself on the way to recovery, on the way to being alive.  Swapping a shitty existence for the threat of cancer - that's not a good swap!  But, genuinely, people around you may not realise. Or they may choose not to realise. - I don't know how old your children are, but my eldest wasn't able to support me when I had cancer a couple of years ago! He ignored the fact, and he was 22 years old then. I am not so sure that your kids are able and aware of your needs right now.  Your husband may very well love the strong woman in you! And you have shown him and yourself how very strong you can be, what you are made of! And in general, I think we are very poor at giving up control and leave things up to anyone else around us.  That is, until we come to breaking point! And at that we feel we have let everyone down, we have let our side down, we are weak, vulnerable, useless and very un-endearing!  You have gone through so much, and I imagine you have self confidence doubts, in the way you now look and with the past experience you have just had. We don't come out the way we go into battle! We change. But we like to hide it, because we lose confidence and self belief. Possibly.  It is time though as you realise to let your guards down. It is the right thing to do, even though you feel vulnerable. You need to let your husband SEE, he needs to know! Otherwise he cannot help you. And if your relationship is anything like mine with my OH, then let me tell you, sometimes they need to be hit with a barge pole!  A couple of weekends ago my husband and I went for a cycling ride. He is a good cyclist, and he is full of enthusiasm. I on the other hand do not ride very often, and I just do not have the muscle strength he has. So, we set off, and had a beautiful day of it. Until, after about 5 hours I completely ran on empty! I had nothing left. But I was not minded to let him know. I had come this far, I would manage! And then I came to yet another bleeding hill .... He cruised up .... And I tried! And then I stopped and I just cried! Really cried, and as he came back down the hill to see where I had got to, he looked shocked! Absolutely shocked! he had had no idea how much I had pushed myself.  I still made it home on my bike! Tbh, a really good cry out in the open was exactly the right thing! I felt so much better for it! And my husband took it more gently, was encouraging, and we had a good old laugh after. But he has since been commenting, he never thought he'd see the day he would 'break' me! Yeah!  Honey, you need some help in sorting out how you are feeling right now. And your first port of call may be your GP. Or your oncologist, to have a check up on the meds you are taking. You are right, the Zoladex may well be keeping the cancer out, but at what price just now? What are the alternatives? And what can be done to ease the pain???  And then there are people you may like to seek out who can listen to you. People who are not close family, and can take on board what you are telling them, without personal implications to them. I am talking counselling here, at outreach centres like Maggies Centre.  In the meantime, let rip here. Say how you feel, because it may help you to get your head around how you are feeling and why that is so. Don't be embarrassed, and don't feel you shouldn't be feeling this way! it's about time you let that cork out of that fizzing bottle, before it explodes or worse: breaks!  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "I feel you have covered it all yourself! You just don't really know, until you have done the first cycle yourself. And the waiting and the unknown at this stage are so frustrating, and so worrying.  I have just had my first round of FEC, and my body couldn't much cope. So, second week I spent in hospital, and third week I just felt hugely tired. Having said that, the oncologist is now looking to make changes to the treatment, so that round 2 is going to be less aggressive. So, I am looking forward to an easier ride from now on.  This, however, threw out my timetabled regime. For the week in hospital I won an extra week of recovery, so instead of a 3 week cycle, i am doing a 4 week cycle this time. Not a problem for me, but, if you are trying to anticipate regular hours, be prepared that things may change. You may have good days and bad days, or good weeks and bad weeks. It's definitely not all baaaaad. Just try and be flexible with it. And in general, I think, working is an excellent idea to get your mind off all the worry, but also, a straight forward fitness issue. I walk as much as I can, just to get that body exercised, to recover all the muscles and bones and the brain, as much as I can for the next round. Great though to hear you be so positive. That's a good ally to have by your side. Dorothee xx  ",

Is there any reason, why they shouldn't carry on firing with chemo, until full eradication? Obviously not forever with breaks. But, I would have a chat with your oncologist. Seems to me like, if you were to compare it with antibiotics, then, yes, you may say you can only be treated with antibiotics, but, there are variations of antibiotics and dosages, so it'd be a lifetimes worth of applying and re applying. But it wouldn't shorten your lifespan necessarily - you'd just be rattling with pills.  The thought of this cancer is very invasive in itself, isn't it. It's mind games! Have you found a counselling person yet? Or a yoga person? Sounds to me like you really need someone who can install a little inner peace again in yourself.  Big hugs from far up North. I am sending you all the peace of mind you can cope with, if that is what you are needing right now.  love, Dorothee xx",

So good to see you have been having such a good and active time.  Running out of steam is just part and parcel of life! Bootcamp just makes us reach our limits a little sooner.  No way feeling guilty about what you have done and enjoyed is going to solve anything! You have had a fab time, and you so deserve it.  I would have thought your brother-in-law's party hasn't just been sprung on you. You knew it was coming up. And you made a perfectly reasonable choice. You didn't 'pace' yourself. You enjoyed what you did to the full. And you might well have considered beforehand that you didn't have much energy left by the end.  It's called prioritising! We can't do it all, and your sister knows that as well. Yes, she would be disappointed, but, her husband's birthday party will be great, whether you are there or not.  So, don't feel guilty. and don't push yourself! It's not worth it.  If they live close, then you may be able to just pop by for an hour. But, if your body says enough is enough, then you are better off listening and taking a duvet day.  During bootcamp our superpowers are just that little more limited. So it's best to acknowledge that and enjoy the best titbits out of a whole arsenal of parties and activities which this time of year has to offer.  Go put the kettle on, and stay in your PJs!  Dorothee xx",

You want to get rid, but it's kind of a lifeline which you have trusted to do its job.  Problem with this cancer treatment is, we have handed over all control to the medics, because we have been resigned to the fact that our body is incapable of making sensible decisions. Apparently it is broken, and is doing its own thing!  And here we are, suddenly having to start believing again that our body does know what it is supposed to be doing. It is quite capable to look after itself again. It just needed some help with the mopping up procedure! - It takes time to get that belief again, to feel 'safe' again within your own body.  If your consultant feels you should wait a little while for things to settle and recover before starting the next treatment, then that to me sounds like a good idea! Remember, although you have had your final tax today - YAY - it does take the three weeks, and more, now for this round to do its job, and then leave your system.  There is no rush, you have done all the hard work! give yourself time to start breathing again! All is well enough, and now comes the part of learning to ride that bike without stabilisers again!  Dorothee xx",

I get the impression you are feeling like you are sitting on a ticking time bomb.  If that is the case, then you are not going feel very relaxed about your circumstances.  My suggestion would be to go back to your oncologist, and to have a very frank conversation. Maybe you could talk this through first with your OH or a close friend, and then take them along to the meeting.  Your medical team have to be able to reassure you one way or the other that what you are doing or not doing is in fact the best possible solution for you.  If they are happy to leave well alone, then they must have good reasons for this, and maybe you are just not yet able to understand why the suggestion has been made to leave and watch.  Leaving and watching, though, is not the same as ignoring! And by the sounds of it, at the moment there is no need to have such a huge procedure done. After all, this is never just a little op. Your poor body really does get put through its paces every time it has to undergo and then recover from such a major operation.  But it's not all about the physical body, is it?! It's about your mental welfare as well. You need support, if not an op, to come round to being able to live with this situation as it is. That takes time, but it also takes reassurance by medical team and maybe by counselling support.  So, long speech here: I would go back and talk all your worries through. Listen carefully, and then make up your mind as to what you feel is best for you!  Good luck, it's not easy.  Dorothee xx",

So, again, just because your neutrophils are low, doesn't mean they are taking you in.  Neutrophils do recover again, but, it seems an extra week is a good idea. So my first cycle took 4 weeks instead of 3. But then after the 4th week I really did feel much better again, ready (if you can ever be) for the next dose.  After the neutrophils had got so low, the oncologist made adjustments to the treatment. In the end, yes, you want to kill the c-blighters, but on the other hand you don't want to damage anything like bone marrow unnecessarily! So, take the time, let the good stuff recover first!

I have got low BP myself, but fortunately no black outs.  My suggestion would be to take it easy, get up slowly, keep digestives or similar by your side - a bit like low BP during early pregnancy. And definitely let your medical team know!  Oh, and are you drinking plenty???? I tried to drink about 3 litres a day. Wasn't always possible, but I did give it a good go. Loads of fluids to wash the toxins out of the system is so important.  And now you are through with the 'bootcamp', give it a little time, and hopefully things will settle back to something more manageable.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

It gets darker and kind of hardens a bit. It is all the trauma caused by the tanning!  If you think, a broken rib is taking a loooong time  before it stops being sore. I think we are coming quite close to making a similar experience here. No break, but deep toasting.  As ever, if you are worried, then it is always a good shout to run it by your medical team. But, yeah, I think rib ache is part of the untold after effects list.  Dorothee xx",

A report saying screening is dangerous is just not helping, because it might put people off going to have their lump checked out!  I think the problem is not the 'screening' in itself, but the resulting 'treatment'!!!!! Surely the scenting isn't at fault for how the lump is being treated!!!  Get the accuracy of the diagnosis improved and the treatment more sensitive to the requirement!!!!!  But don't stop inviting people to get screened - that would be a Huge step in the wrong direction!  Dorothee xx",

You are doing all the right things!  I imagine you are going to be meeting your specialist, and there are investigations going to happen. Possibly a mammogram, a scan, and then they may well take biopsies, too.  The results of all of these tests are going to be another little waiting game, but they ware really important, and determine how your specialist is going to go on from there.  DO keep in mind, that you may very well have something other than cancer. At this stage you really only know that you haven't got Nothing!  If it is, then, even though you will be guiding your way along your mum's history, there is so much that can be done! And no person is exactly like the next. Your life is different to your mum's. And you have taken every precaution!  So glad you have come on here to share. Waiting for News of this kind is never easy, but you will find people here have all experienced similar, and we are well qualified to listen and support you.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "I don't think cancer cells are intelligent enough to set up a conspiracy against our bodies, as in, if we remove one 'playing field' then they just pack up and move into another one.  Having said that, once you have an established cancer in one region, then any 'floaters' would be settling somewhere other than removed breasts, if, in fact, that was where they were going to settle.  As far as I see it, primary cells originally start changing in situ. So, for someone who is tripple neg that might mean randomly anywhere. It would be secondaries, that find new homes through wandering.  As for removing both breasts in anticipation ... well, apparently Sharon Osborne did it. I imagine you are able to get this done privately if you so wish. Does it make sense medically? Does it make sense psychologically to yourself?  Let me address the latter first: I understand you are struggling with your own body image, with having had one breast taken off. So maybe, by removing your other breast you may think you may regain that balance, the 'sameness'. And it may work better for you.  As for medically: who knows? Your present cancer cells may jump ship, but then they may be kept contained. If they jump ship, they may jump anywhere OTHER than the other breast.  Would that cause you to wonder, if you could, whether in anticipation you might like to remove an organ, or part of your intestine, just in case?  Don't know if these thoughts are making any sense to you.  Much love Dorothee xx",

Wait for results, and then you know what you are dealing with. You talk about your family worrying as well, My suggestion would be for now, make that your ally! let people around you know how you feel. Ask for someone to go along to your appointment. It is a pretty scary experience, and there might be a lot of information exchanged.

I got my big scare a year ago - actually had my official diagnosis a year and two days ago.  I, like yourself, had found a lump in my one breast, and I also went to my GP with it. And thankfully, he also took it very seriously and I got referred to the specialists. First I saw a surgeon, who did all the investigation, and eventually my op, and then I got passed onto my very lovely oncologist.  I have also been very lucky with their support team: you will find the breastcare nurses so valuable for any extra support. They will be there for any questions you didn't remember to ask, and any extra time you need to get things through your head -  But let me not move beyond your next appointment - let's see what they say first. For me: long year. I did the 'bootcamp' and the 'tanning' and I am now on all sorts of aftercare 'stuff'. But: I am absolutely fine!  So, it can be done. - My dad also died of cancer, not even 5 years from my diagnosis. His was another cancer, he'd had non-hotchkin's lymphoma. - It kind of made it easier not to compare, because it was so obviously different. But, as I said before: you are YOU, not your mum. And I am still here!  Let me know how you get on.  Take care Dorothee xx",

Panicked by the urgency, and the feeling that you are both running out of time.  I would suggest to take a deep breath.  Now, your friend isn't going to leave you now, if there are still months to have. So, she has time to think this through sensibly.  You are brilliant for trying to provide options for her, and to present those to her. But then you also have to step back and allow what development takes shape. Things will fall into place as and when they are right. And at the moment it seems to me that an ideal solution has as yet not been found.  Something will haven when it is really really important!  The boyfriend may appear stubborn, but then maybe he is reluctant to just make decisions on the run! I can understand that, especially if he has a job, and he has a home. Yes, he loves her, but his priorities are not necessarily to see himself move closer to her family, when he might feel he is more able to look after her just exactly where they are now.  Apart from moving, there is also the option to just keep commuting, both her, whilst she is able, and her family, if they feel as strongly as she does that they want to be near her.  I don't know whether maybe she hasn't shared her sense of urgency with her family, because she doesn't want to worry them. And you are quite right, that it is not your place to do so. But if that was the case, then trying to gently nudge her to more fully communicate with her lot, would actually benefit both parties. Because then everyone is on the same sheet!  You are truly a very good friend. But you cannot do it for her. She has to make the decisions herself. And I think you have to allow her the time to be frightened, and to come to the right decisions in her own time. If that ultimately means she moves without the boyfriend, then so be it. If it means she doesn't move, then I would suggest that was in the end more important to her.  I wonder, do you have a Maggie's centre near you? Or another similar drop-in, where there are people, who can help you and your friend, just by listening, to come to a more peaceful frame of mind. Ultimately, that is what you are trying to achieve for the two of you!  I am glad you have found us here, and please feel free to keep communicating here. It is hopefully going to be useful for yourself to just get your thoughts straight, and to maybe stop that initial panic.  Hugs,  Dorothee xx",

I have just been to my first 'annual' mammogram - it is well past a year for me.  And even though my objective part of my brain was telling me, don't be silly, this is just routine, there is nothing untoward, the reality was that I was shitting myself as I was sat outside the ominous office.  The problem is that the not-so-objective part of our brain recollects all the steps and stages from the one previous experience which so unsettled us! We prepare ourselves for the worst case scenario, and make the comparison with what we already experienced. I don't know about you, I had found my lump myself. So I was aware that there was something when I presented in Mai of last year. Having quite small boobs I feel I am maybe in a better position to find something, and that kind of helped me as I turned up for my mammogram this time. I had not felt a lump this time round! On top of that I am swimming with Herceptin still and I am rattling with Tamoxifen. So, come on ... what chance realistically could there be that those blighters are still kicking around?!  And yet, there I was, sat waiting for my appointment, really really needing to know that there is nothing on the scan!  I have been told it gets easier! And in a way, I have already started to experience that. It is a case of learning to trust that you have a life and a future again. Learning to trust that you feel comfortable with your changed healthy body. - But I think there may always be certain events which bring the fear right back to us, just because of the trauma that was caused with our first diagnosis.  Maybe my advice is, be aware, that the worry and angst you experience is in part a re-living of the events a year ago. You are in the best hands, and you have had the treatment. And from now on, if there is a recurrence, they will find it really early!  Good luck, and let us know of the results. Don't envy you for the squishing experience though!  Dorothee xx",

A complete overload of information, feelings, attitudes, suggestions, well-meaning advice.  At this point I think what I would need to do first of all is go into a soundproof room and scream! And shout! - And as I have suggested before: throw some plates!  And then, start again. But one step at a time! One decision at a time, one concept at a time!  Maybe, whilst you are in your sound-proof room, have a little listen to yourself: what is it that I need to know just now? What is it I want first and foremost just now?  And take it from there!  Trust me, you don't need a wig just now! Not unless YOU feel you do! Apart from that, I have not used wigs myself, I have gone with scarves and beanie hats.  And TRYING to stay positive doesn't cut it for me either! because by trying so hard, you might miss the fact that actually you have all sorts of emotions which you are not letting to the surface! You may well want to be positive, but you have to make room for it! And so, I don't think there is anything wrong with acknowledging all the other feelings and emotions you have just now: fear, anger, loss, frustration! Give them some attention too - maybe more plates are needed, and the soundproof room is needing reinforcing!  Seriously, one step at a time! And you prioritise on YOUR terms!

And maybe speaking to one of the Macmillan nurses here on the free phone line might bring you a bit more clarity on options for your friend.  But I am also wondering whether you yourself are getting enough support here! It might be useful for you to link into the Family And Friends group. There you can openly discuss with other carers what options and what frustrations you have.  Your friend is very fortunate to have you there beside her. It is great when someone can do the leg work when you feel all rotten. So well done you. - However, you are likely to have problems, because of your friend's independence, but also because you are not considered family. And unless you are really close with her family, I am not sure you are in the loop of what is being discussed among them. If she feels she needs to be close to them, and they feel the same way, then it is up to them to sort out her living arrangements.  I would also be a little cautious on the notion of 'months to live'. How long is a piece of string?? How do we know how long anyone does along the road of treatments. She may surprise you all, and really have a shot at the treatments still available to her. I have friends who have been diagnosed with 'terminal cancer', and they are still kicking the boot at the dreaded disease!! Not going anywhere yet!  Committing to taking in your friend, into your home is very commendable. But it is also very very hard! And you have no idea how long you have invited her in for!  I do hope you and your friend find a way through this maze.  Dorothee xx",

As all the brand new cells are being destroyed that would include any cells which would just want to do the general maintenance and skin repair. This leaves you with wounds which struggle to heal.  They really do take you to the very edge! Hang on in there honey! A lot of what you are going through has purpose!  And if staying in bed is all you can manage for now, then stay in bed!  Sending strength and warmth Dorothee xx",

But then, having a mastectomy is a much bigger op than a lumpectomy, and there are more risks in that too. My lumpectomy was on my left breast as well, and I am about to undertake 4 weeks of rads. And my breasts aren't terribly big either, so, not much padding ;) . But I trust that my heart is just going to cope with what I am giving it to handle. And I will take the hint of taking it easy, and taking the rest.  If you and your mum trust the oncologist, then I think, go with that. The journey your mum is going to take is not an easy one, whichever choices she makes. So, be there for her and support her, as you are doing! It is so important to know people are rooting for you when the going gets tough.  Thinking of you both, Dorothee xx ",

I can relate to that.  It's like we think we have been holding all the threads which make our lives tick. We are so busy organising, we anticipate so as to reduce damage before it happens. We are masters of damage control, after all! And then, bang, things are happening where there doesn't appear to be a thread to hold. Stuff happens, out of control.  Your lack of sleep, I think, may be your mind's unconscious efforts to be claiming back some control: you may be missing something, you are letting go - and you cannot afford to do that.  And yet, I think, in the end, it was the complete handing over of the control to the medics, which saved my sanity!  Like you, I feel I am one of the very lucky ones here: I had the lumpectomy last May and have had all the bootcamp and tanning, am still doing tablets and Herceptin. But: I am here!! And ticking over nicely!  It takes time to feel the trust in your life again, in finding those threads again, which in all the panic you dropped, and you will find new threads to pick up and enjoy!  As for the thread which is called cancer treatment: leave that one for your oncologist and your nurses to carry! Let others share your balancing act of control. Let them make decisions of how to move forward with your treatment, and TRUST you are doing what feels right!  And then, with a hot bubble bath, a glass of bubbly, candles - celebrate! you have got so far through this hell-hole! you deserve to sit back, pat yourself on your back! You are doing well!  And then maybe, just maybe, you can trust yourself to get a good night sleep again! Sleep, after all, is healing! Your body and your mind need healing. Let your sleep do the mending for you! Dorothee xx",

And I accepted it!: Project 365 - or as it was a leap year, it turned out to be Project 366.  You take a photograph every single day of the year, and keep a picture diary of your personal year that way. - Little did I know in January what was going to happen through the year. I found my lump in April, had my op in May, started Bootcamp in June etc.  I posted my pictures as I saw them on the day, each day, with a little caption, a comment of relevance. That way I shared with friends, who were and are important to me. It stopped stupid questions at times, because I could say 'had a shitty day', or it was obvious by what was going on. It also really took away the taboo from the ominous cancer . I knew people knew, and so conversation didn't have to get started on 'how are you'.  In the main though it was a beautiful collection of really lovely memories of the year. I made a picture book of a selection of the pictures at the end of the year and gave it my husband for his Christmas present. Looking through it now, I can honestly say, I have had another amazing year - despite everything! The wonderful things I experienced totally outweigh Bootcamp and Tanning, but make it all so much worth it!  Dorothee xx",

We are much more atune to what is important and what is waffle. and we don't have time for rubbish, because life is too precious!  People always make stupid, unnecessary conversation - worst one is at my Asda check-out, when the lady ask \"so, how are you today?\" - My thoughts are always \"now, where do I begin ...\"  And then you get people who really do care, but they are more worried about their own feelings, and really want you to feel sorry for them, because they are so worried about YOU!  There is a kind of helplessness in there. Not knowing what to say or what to do. - I told my mum off for asking me how I was every other day! I was honest and brutal! But I needed to get the question out of the way from her. On a bad day I didn't want to be asked, and on a good day I didn't feel I wanted to be bothered.  The question of 'how are you' actually becomes incredibly sensitive and meaningful, and it throws us into the 'cancer victim' situation! That's where we belong, that's our destitute, and that's all we can now talk about and live with. That question removes the fact that I am still me, I am still interested in other things, I am still quite capable of holding a normal conversation!  The question brings to the fore the fact that we have changed, and we are working on a new alignment! We are working with new rules in our lives. And it is something both we and our environment have to get used to.  Dorothee xx",

I am an embarrassment, I keep being told. lol  Being worried when it comes to the end of our prescribed treatment I think is only to be expected. Suddenly we are left to our own devices again, and yet, normal is just not normal.  It's like learning to walk all over again. I am taking first steps, and I am so unsure about so much. Slotting back into the routines as if nothing has happened is just not realistic. I think it will take time to find that confidence again that things are okay.  I have just booked flights for May to visit family, and I have been nervous even to do that, because so much can happen ... - Or better: so much did happen last year at that time. Last year I had booked a similar flight, then found my lump in April, and then everything went pear shaped.  Maybe, if we have done a year of no issues, then the confidence may come back and settle us into our new lives.  Dorothee xx",

And you have not had any time at all to even scratch the surface of coming to terms with it. On top of that, it sounds to me you are still mourning the loss of your mum. And having lost her to cancer brings back all the memories now, and you are faced with all her angst again now.  I can see your thinking. you need the thing out, and you need to take precaution that it doesn't return.  Okay, so far so good.  Things to consider:  are there guarantees that you are taking the best option? NO! So, you have to come to a decision of what feels best for you just now. And making that decision with as much information as you can get, is probably a wise move.  Right, point of least side effects: I am not sure here, but I believe a double mastectomy is Hugely invasive on your body! It will take a while to get over such an op. And the risks are there as well, with anaesthetic, inflamation of wounds. And straight forward compromised mobility.  Side effects from rads, in comparison, is tiredness. And rib pain possibly.  Side effects of tablets, well, that depends on the individual. personally, I have been fine so far. Having done Tamoxifen and Herceptin now for a year. I can honestly say, it is not holding me back. And I have the reassurance that my body is still trying to protect itself.  Your grade one tumour really is very small. And if your medical team is happy that they have removed it all, then why not trust them in their prognosis for you. It is the least invasive option.  I hope you will be able to make an informed choice. It's tough, and very scary for you right now. But they have found it early, and treatments are in general very successful these days.  Dorothee xx",

I called the 'tanning studio' and the nurses were lovely and said just get there when you can. So, I just took it gently and arrived late.  But if you are stressing about going in the first place because weather is bad, then my advise would be: stay safe! No point trying to kill yourself on the roads - yes, the pun is intended! ;)  Keep safe!  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "Hi Friz,  I am wondering whether you are experiencing 'cording'. - In effect, your veins tighten up, and you feel you can't stretch as you used to, and you may well see your veins, like a line going up your lower arm.  Yes, that would be a side-effect. And the only consolation really is, that the veins will try and recover once you have finished with your bootcamp.  In the meantime, I think it massively helps to know what it is. And to know that other people get the same issue.  STRETCHING helps! I used the arm to reach for mugs in the cupboards, and plates etc. And I got the physio to show me stretch moves, which would be gentle, but would work towards getting the arm more mobile again, or keeping it as mobile as possible.  You may want to ask at your next chemo to have it run through a little slower, and make sure that they definitely run the saline through after you have had the chemo, in order to flush the veins as much as you can.  Having said all that, I would mention it at your next appointment with the medics. let them know you are in pain. Don't just assume! It's always best to have things checked out properly.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

And as brave as we may all be, and as hopeful and passionate to be doing the right thing or the best thing to hold the cancer away, it is a sudden jerk to reality that we are unfortunately not invincible. And sometimes, nothing we do is ever going to make the slightest bit of a difference.  I believe it was Annie's time. It's as straight forward as that. We can't choose when we come into this world and we can't choose when we have to depart - the difference is, on departing, we have memories and hopes and anticipation - the luxury of consciousness.  Consciousness is the trade off for our beautiful lives. It makes it hard, but it is central to who we are. Because of Annabel's brave struggle and the way her family are so admirably trying to cope, I feel myself in a better place for addressing my own fears. I am grateful for her sharing, and I embrace the inevitability with more of an open eye. The difference is not in WHEN do I have to leave this beautiful place, but HOW am I going to spend the time I am still given. Lots of love to you all out there Dorothee xx ",

      "Content": "hey,  I am wondering about your terminology of your two lumps:  the medics refer to both 'grade' and 'stage'. Both mean different things.  Your grade of tumour is the type of aggressiveness.  Your stage as to do with size and spread.  I am not trying to be pedantic here, just trying to see if I can get some more insight for yourself in why sounds like all new and very scary info!  The grading of your tumours are being done with the help of your biopsies. And if they are both from the same root, then I would think they are probably the same grading.  Now, grading really is just something for the medical team to worry about, I think. It determines for them what kind of treatment they ail be giving you.  Mine was graded as 3, which was pretty nasty, but then it was all hormone positive, and with that they have had lots of angles to go shoot the bugger down!  Stage, as I say, has to do with size and spread. Again, it really is medics terminology to categorise what they are dealing with.  Stage 2 starts at 2cm in size. There is nothing more to it than that.    My guess is, but please correct me if I am wrong, that what you have been given are stages, rather than grades. One lump being smaller than the other, and the possibility of localised spread.  I hope this bit of info helps a little. It's not meant to frighten you. It's meant to take the fear of the unknown a little.  Dorothee xx",

And as your bruising is coming out and the swelling from the op is calming down, so the battered and tingled nerves come out to play for a while.  I must admit, the nerves around my affected breast have had a battering, and I get strange sensations of numbness, like when you get back from the dentist. And in the first place it really felt a bit like the nerves were waking up again. It will all calm down, I am certain.  But the other thing is, I am also quite sure you are more aware of what's going on in your affected breast. And just that hyper awareness may make you feel more sensitive. - Welcome to the club of hypochondriacs! This is your initiation ceremony!  You may well find that you worry now about all sorts of feelings, bumps, or bumps which aren't even there. It is a case of learning to trust your body again, and that does take time. Also, certainly for myself, I used to take it for granted that both sides would be the same! And that was how I discovered my lump in the first place - it was different.  You may now start to feel all sorts of differences between your two boobies, especially if you go down the route of radiotherapy. It is a case of learning from scratch your new body image again.  Dorothee xx",

My heart goes out out to you, and I would love to just give you a great big hug and let you know you are so not alone!  This is tough, and I think it is even tougher when you have done it all once before. You need to give yourself time to absorb it all. Feeling strong isn't all about keeping things in, either. Feeling strong, I think also means knowing when it's time to let go, time to have a howl, or a blubber.  It's shit, and you are just as well to call it that. But you also know you have done it once before, and things move on all the time! So there is every reason to be positive. Maybe looking at it as an isolated incident puts another angle to the perspective. Rather than saying: it's back. Say: it's a separate one. And as you now have had a mastectomy you have shown the c-cells where to get off! Also consider that maybe the change in your state of hormones is now changing, and possibly making you feel less like yourself. Tamoxifen has a lot to answer for! :)  I am wondering, how would you feel about some pampering? Get the duvet out onto the sofa and watch movies, find those naughty chocolates, have a candle lit bubble bath. - And celebrate the fact that you are doing awesome!

And they have been a fantastic support system for me - most probably, because I could be totally brutally honest with them.

Letting those emotions flow makes space for emotions which are going to be much more practical for you! Getting some of that fighting spirit back, telling the c-cells to piss off, alongside the bathwater down the drain!  Positive thinking is so helpful, so important. But there has to be room for it.

Pains everywhere, ulcers, headaches and hair everywhere except on your head ... yeah, there are some good reasons to feel sorry for yourself and have a good moan, and a good cry!!!  Trying to figure what is causing what is pretty difficult too. But I think the advice of reading your body temp is a good one. When the temperature is normal, then you are okay!  As you are loosing hair so incredibly badly - or rather well?! - Have you considered making an appointment with your lovely hairdresser, and having a No1? It makes the loss a little more bearable, I think, as you just have to deal with it the once in one go. And part of your headache problem is that the roots of your hair are being pulled by the weight of the hair, and that's causing the nerves in your scalp to play havoc!  I am very much a supporter of having a good cry, when you feel like it! No shame in that, and the body kind of does self help, in that you will feel better after! And it clears your head to make space again for coping with the onslaught!  I am also a great supporter of smashing crockery! - Retail therapy is useful anyway!! There are times when life does get frustrating, and we are so not in control of anything, and we just have to sit and bear it!

I believe people have gone back to having periods after chemo, so there is definitely room for 'normality' returning.  Myself, I have not had any, I get the odd spots, but nothing like a proper period.

It's amazing what a good night's sleep can do - if you are getting one of those.  I reckon after the op and all your treatment your body and your mind just cry out for recovery. after all, we never wanted to be there in the first place, did we?! So your focus is now set on healing! On getting better - but with very little resilience left, as all your energy has been sapped!  In the big picture, this infection really is only a minor set-back, which will hopefully be dealt with quite swiftly with the antibiotics you are now on.  In the meantime, remember, take it easy. Give your body and your mind that space and time to recover slowly. Treat yourself to some 'me'-time, and maybe have a look whether your local cancer drop-in does any form of complementary therapy, which may encourage that healing process both physically and emotionally.  Hugs, Dorothee xx",

So cool that you have had the courage and nerve to keep going back for the answers nobody wants to get!  But it appears to me you have been finding your cancers whilst they have been really small, so you have been kind of on top of things! And so you are giving yourself all the chance in the world to get this bugger snuffed out of your system for good.  It is every mum's nightmare, isn't it, to have to unsettle their innocent young lives. But, kids can be quite resilient. No, it won't just pass by them either, and they will have their own way of coping. But I am sure with a loving mum like yourself, they have every opportunity to be loved and cared for.  I would think talking with them must be a good way forward - and maybe not just yourself talking with them, but another close friend or family member.

I kept checking my moles - I hadn't anticipated breast cancer ... Bugger! That went under the radar!  Seriously though. What are we to make of this study? Blame it on the moles? Is it a genetic malfunction? Are we going to worry anyone who has moles into believing they are sat on the verge of getting breast cancer?  Maybe, the correlation, which is what it appears to be in that study, has a third factor: it may be related to the caucasian skin type. I don't know whether breast cancer for example is more prevalent in white folk than in coloured skin people.  I personally suspect my hormone treatment to be the culprit of my cancer. But, I suspect, nobody can tell you for certain what has sparked the cells off to go on a shopping spree for more! There is just the possibility of predisposing factors. We have just got to be careful though, that we are not getting frightened by correlating factors, which may not be causations at all!  Dorothee xx",

And when you go, she might give you a relaxing head massage as well - so soothing!  I was going to have a chat with my hairdresser, too. Now that I know my chemo is upon me soon. I have short hair anyway, but was wondering about when to have it cut even shorter. I am not going with the cold cap, but I don't want to have the trauma of hair falling out over a period of time either. So, thought I might get some advice on how to minimise my stress levels.  Just starting to get my head around having to wear head scarves for the next few months as well - I am in denial!!!!

Nothing to worry about, because this is monitored, and your mum might then be given tablets to support the heart.  But even if nothing shows up, the heart does work harder to cope with the treatment. And a fainting attack can easily happen, when your mum is feeling tired and washed out.  To make sure mum is fine, and doesn't hurt herself, maybe you can suggest that when she feels faint, to sit down, and put her head down between her knees, and concentrate on breathing.  It may also be a good idea for her to carry with her some digestive biscuits or something similar to nibble on. That should keep the bloodsugar in check. And Drink plenty. - But maybe have a play about with caffeine! that might cause issues, as well as hot flushes! And if she has fainting episodes at particular time s in the day, it might be useful to monitor when that might be. And then report it back to the onc or the GP!  Hot flushes are part and parcel of the Herceptin game, and your mum probably also takes tablets like Tamoxifen. these induce menopause, and the hot flushes are part of that! They do get better, but yeah, it's not much fun. The heat regulator appears to be boycotting the general regard for a happy life!  Dorothee xx",

Open the floodgates and have a scream! - I found it quite therapeutic to throw some china as well! - Followed by retail therapy! Your body has just gone through major surgery! It wasn't just a little nip and a tug! You need time to recover physically, as well as mentally, and emotionally!  From a psychological point of view in your brain, I think, it would like to take time out now, to recover: to process all the new information, to set itself up with new coping strategies. - And then you find you don't seem to have that time, because the run-away train hasn't as yet programmed in a convenient stop!  I agree with Dee, good idea to just take it one step at a time!  And leave the planning and organisation to your medical team! That's what they are good at.  When I entered the world of cancer last year, I found I handed over the controls to my surgeon, my oncologist and my wonderful team of nurses. they tell me what is best for me, and they make the appointments. All I have to do is be there, and COPE!  I believe this process is one of grieving, just as much as we might be suffering some form of post traumatic stress! We are generally not prepared for the news we are being given at point of diagnosis. And we are ill-equipped to handle the effects and changes.  This journey is draining! And it will continue to drain for a while yet. So, again, I agree with Dee: if you can get a support network in place to help you along, that's not being defeatist, it's not being self indulgent - It's sensible precaution.  We are meant to be social animals, and yet we hide in the corner, when we are poorly! In this situation it shows strength and willpower to hold up your hand and say I am not coping here!  Just one step at a time - and you are so not on your own!  Hugs Dorothee xx",

Very well done for coming this far!  During the 2012 class we had been talking about 'becoming upgrades' of ourselves. I think that is a very good terminology! It throws out the comparison and expectation of what is or used to be 'normal'. And it puts us into a brand new playing field, which we should recognise and work with.  Upgrades: we have changed so much, physically and emotionally and mentally and spiritually since we began climbing the mountain that's cancer.  Maybe comparing it to the climb of a mountain isn't such a bad idea: you climbed up it, with tears and sweat. There wasn't anywhere else to go, as the gorge next to you was just a sheer drop. So, you started to climb, never knowing how long, how far, or what was around the corner.  But you carried on walking, trusting that this was a good enough route to take. Hoping it would get you across to easier grounds. Now you have reached the summit! Yeah. Taken a good look around, and it's all been well worth the climb. How beautiful the world can look! - But now you have just recently started on the way down! Arrrgh, scary, as you notice the gorge is still there right next to you! And you are exhausted from the earlier climb up. Your body hasn't recovered itself yet. If you sat down now, you'd get cramps, and would want to fall asleep. You don't want to walk down any more now, you just want to be back down off the mountain!  Take your time walking on down. You will find it does get easier, as you start trusting yourself again. Give yourself all the rest on the way, you deserve it, your body and your mind need it!  But don't look to walk on the other side of the mountain either! You are now on the side you came down: take a good look round. It appears to be the same, but it so isn't: is the grass always greener on the other side? No, but it's different. And because you have climbed that mountain, you are equipped to take a good look around! There are new challenges, new opportunities, there's a new you! Just make sure you take your time, and keep walking along the path. You have come so far. Don't give up on yourself now!  Dorothee xx",

There are a to of folk here who know what you are feeling right now.  Mixed up with info sounds about right in the beginning. You feel like a train has hit you. You hadn't seen it coming and it just flattened you.  So many bits of information, so little time, and no control. That's how it feels at first. but seriously, this does improve. It's maybe not the right terminology, but 'you will kind of get used to it'. The information will start to make sense, especially once your medical team set out a treatment plan for you.  My husband works 28/28, so I totally understand how you feel about sharing with him, when he is about to set off, or when you know he is away. It's difficult. And you don't want him to worry. - however, I am sure he will worry anyway, so you might as well share, and not keep him in the dark.  I have got a very close friend, who I confided in, whilst my OH was away. I had found my lump, and had to make all arrangements whist he was away. And I found it unbelievably helpful that my wonderful friend was there with me. She was detached enough, but totally caring. She came along to meetings, made lists, asked questions, and then after the meeting talked things through with me, as I was overwhelmed with all the info, and what it all meant.  My advice to you would be, take it all one step at a time, and if you can confide in a good friend, then go for it. let someone help you carry that weight just now.  And, do come here for questions and rants! people know what's going on inside you here.  Hugs,  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "Hi Denise,  Congratulations! You have come such a long way already!  This thing is not a sprint, it's a marathon! And each lap/chemo session/bootcamp is reducing your resistance. This shit is wearing us down. Both physically and mentally. So, each time you have to summon up the courage to go for another session, it does get that bit harder!  What i hung onto was ticking off the ones I had already completed! And as the list of those became longer, and in comparison the list of those to be conquered was getting shorter, I felt I could manage those as well.  But, I do remember just crying as the last chemo session was in progress. It is so strange how the mind overruled any suggestion that I should not be doing this. I knew I had to. And yet, I watched as the poison was slowly running back into my veins, and I knew it was going to give me all those horrid side effects, again...  It does get tougher! But, you are getting there!!! And you have very bravely managed your treatment so far! Now you have to find those extra reserves! And hopefully find from other ladies here that coping with Tax is also doable! It is!  Huge hugs,  Dorothee xx",

Congratulations for not letting it overwhelm you.  I am also hearing you appreciating the stress you have been under, and most probably still are under. I am wondering, like you, if this is stress related, and if so, whether it is just a delayed reaction by your body. As you are saying you have been in the torment since September. Maybe your body is only just really catching up to the News. You are only just 6 months down the line. That's still very early days!  And in that case, maybe there is a way of addressing your stress. A lot of it is very obvious, but then there might be hidden agendas, which cause you extra concern, like looking after loved ones, holding down your job etc.  I am not so sure about the regeneration of colour in your hair. It may be a case of making an appointment with the hair salon. But, have you got people around you to bounce your worries off to? Friends who make cups of tea and have boxes of tissues may come in very handy just now.  Big hugs, Dorothee xx",

I must admit I did not have your symptom, so can't confirm anything.  But I would go have it checked out. Might just be localised side effect. I am wondering also though whether you sat awkwardly when the infusion was running, whether maybe you strained a nerve in your neck or upper back? And you may be getting referred pain.  Either case, no point worrying, because that usually makes us feel worse. And the docs may need to know about possible side effects anyway.  All the best, hope it improves soon. Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "Hey Bobby, Getting freaked out, I think, seems a very natural defence, when you are totally in the dark about what is happening to you. It is like free fall for you just now, because you haven't got a map of any kind as yet as to where you are heading.  On this site, I have found over and over the comments: don't go googling! And I think that is sound advice. For the reason, that your cancer is going to be very specific. The genetic detailing which they are going to find out about your tumour is going to help you in the long run with your treatment. But that is going to take a little more time, and you need to exercise some more patience - not a great word in my vocabulary, either!!!  Great shame you have been worried/anxious for such a long time, and are finding yourself not having been taken serious enough, soon enough??? - Don't dwell on it - maybe they were right then, maybe not - but, it's in the past. Let it go, if you can, because you are using up negative energy, and, boy, will you be needing a lot of positive energy from here on in!  Your path forward is going to be so much easier, I think, once you get some of your answers. Brace yourself for the diagnosis - that's shit to take! - But then you will be moving onto your treatment plan, and that's your first port of call, with regards: right, this is what I am dealing with, and this is what is going to be happening to me.  Take one step at a time, deep breath, and speak with your BC nurse!!! They are clever people, and she may ease you into your way forward, by answering questions, specific to your cancer, and to your situation.  And maybe you will be able to get good soundings off all these wonderful ladies here, too, who have been finding that these days 'there is soooo much that can be done' - due to amazing research advances, we are in such more capable hands here! Makes it a good grounding for a positive battleground!!! - Let your fight begin! Dorothee xx",

Yay!  I just wanted to point you to another group here, which you like to pop into, now that you have graduated from this one.  There is a group called Life after Cancer. And I think it highlights the fact that we feel very vulnerable and we encounter issues which we hadn't anticipated. But it's not a question any more as to how to get through bootcamp, and how do you do tanning. It's a case of how do you cope fitting back into your life? Why do people think I am 'fine' now? Why does my life not feel like it used to?  If you feel you are struggling with any of those, just make sure you know you can come back and share.  Dorothee xx",

      "Content": "YES, it is statistical jargon. And in your case for childcare, I imagine it has to do with insurance policies.  A prognosis is a 'guesstimate' of what is possible/likely. But it is taken from the past history of many, many other people. It is not YOUR definite future, because we are all so very different. And our bodies cope differently with the challenges. And then there is treatment, which is always improving. We are in such a different position to people only about 10 or 20 years ago. And things are improving all the time.  Getting it in black and white is harsh, especially when you are feeling well and are coping well. Take a deep breather, and maybe have a chat with your BC nurse, to ease your worries, that you are not likely to keel over just yet. ;)  And good luck and all the best with your fostering.

      "Content": "hi Linda, hard luck. Hope you haven't been too unwell.  I have had 2 excursions to hospital due to Neutropenia. And both times I just couldn't get the temp under control. But once the antibiotics were flowing things were fine.  First time round I had an incredibly sore mouth. Funnily enough the docs kept looking for the source of the infection, looking everywhere, and I kept telling them I have a bloody sore mouth! lol.  The second time round I was okay, once I got my antibiotics.  On both occasions my oncologist reviewed the dosage of my FEC. After the first Neutropenia the dosage was reduced to 70% on one of the ingredients. The other time was after No4, and he took out the F part altogether. Then I got bloods, and he said, if there was any more trouble he would stop the chemo altogether and move on to Herceptin earlier. Thankfully, all was fine though, and I finished the whole course. I guess the problem is that the dosage and ratios are measured purely by weight and height, and maybe by age. But that doesn't take into consideration anything personal such as fitness, metabolism, diet etc. We are all individuals, and the havoc which is supposed to be caused is therefore individually differently experienced.  I don't think you can do much to keep from getting Neutropenic. It is most likely your own bugs, which usually live in peace and harmony with you, that start aggravating you when your defence system is down. It will be your own bugs in your throat or elsewhere.  I would certainly think your oncologist should be having a chat with you as to how he is hoping to proceed from here. After all, the chemo is meant to be keeping you alive!! Not give you the rest!  but then you might just have been very unlucky and you may just sail through the rest from here on.  Good luck. Keep fingers crossed and the worst is done.  Dorothee xx",
