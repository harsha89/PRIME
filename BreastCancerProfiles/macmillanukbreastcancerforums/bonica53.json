Got my SNB, mx & recon coming up & struggling to imagine the oncoming change in lifestyle. Everyone depends on us don't they? Also sick of everyone telling me how strong I am when I'm crumbling on the inside!just managed to get myself fit & tone up via Pilates & am gutted to have to give it up in hopefully only the short term. Sorry am waffling! Good luck with your op hope it goes well",

      "Content": "Hi Isingbass I agree that low fat is rubbish, but low carb doesn't have to mean lots of red meat-Pulses, nuts, oily fish are great too. I know there's a lot of 'cancer' diets & quackery out there, but I've found a great resource recommended  by a friend who also has cancer. It's by a chap called Chris Woollams. He's a biochemist and has lots of scientifically researched evidence on the benefits of supplements. Check out his Canceractive charity online.I have his book Everything you need to know to beat cancer. It's interesting that in the US there seems to be much more use of supplements, more research  and a holistic approach in their big cancer  treatment centres. I take probiotics, vitamin  C & D, omega fish oils & grape seed extract, magnesium & zinc.  As a former nurse myself, I would say that the medical profession is only just scratching the surface of the mind/ body connection & that supplements are frowned on because the research on their efficacy is not widely reported",

      "Content": "Hi Unoxx It's a difficult decision to make but as others have pointed out, there's lots of info out there to help you. I can only speak from my own experience- I had the LD flap reconstruction last June & I  very happy with the result.  You're right, it is a long op @6hrs, & recovery time.  I was off work for 12 weeks & had some fluid (seroma) in the new breast afterwards( this is quite common). Despite this I am really happy with the result. I am 54 & am a 38DD so my boobs are not exactly pert! The flap gives a really natural look and feel. Many women who have an LD flap require an implant as well to make a match with the natural breast- especially if you have a larger bust.However, luckily I didn't need an implant as I had enough muscle to make a match with my natural breast.  Good luck to you & your mum- there is light at the end of the tunnel!  Sharon",

      "Content": "Hi Charpar  The LD flap has not restricted my movement at all.i really worried about this like you.  I was lucky as I didn't have any positive nodes in lymph glands as having the axillary glands removed can cause problems in the arm/ lymph oedema-  There are exercises to do from day one to get your shoulder & arm moving & I did these religiously. I do Pilates regularly & am a keen walker & gardener & it doesn't bother me. Obviously during the recovery period I wouldn't suggest any rock climbing & there is some weakness initially & stiffness across the back, which I find Pilates helps enormously. Almost a year on from surgery, I barely notice the difference. Hope this helps Sharon",

I have worn one of my pre-surgery under-wired ones & they're ok for a few hours eg if you're going out & want that uplifted look! Sometimes they dig in under the arms where the muscle was moved, but they have definitely got more comfortable as my scars have healed. Btw I'm a 38DD so need some support. Hope this helps Sharon x",

      "Content": "Hi LittleWren, I've just read your post & thought I'd offer my experience of reconstruction. I'm 53 & had an immediate skin saving recon following a Mastectomy in June. I had the muscle in my back used to create a new boob. I'm really pleased with the result as it is very much like my own natural breast- incredible really! I can't say it's been a doddle. I certainly needed help for the first I'd say 3-4 weeks with household tasks, shopping & cooking at first. I felt very tired & overdid it a few times when I decided I was better! I have also had some fluid build up in my back but that's clearing now. I've been off work for 10 weeks & luckily I have a decent job with paid leave. Now I'm feeling like my old self & did a 6 mile hike last week. It definitely takes a bit  of time to recover & I considered myself quite fit beforehand, being a keen walker & doing Pilates regularly. I've tried to think of the process in the longer term- the result is certainly worth it for me. ",

Ended up in A & E full of fluid one evening! I have a seroma on my back which has been drained 3 times now & just completed a course of antibiotics. My back is stiff but I'm doing the exercises several times a day to regain full range of movement. I think I expected too much of myself & although they tell you to take it easy, you don't realise what this means or how long your body takes to recover. I now try to stop & rest during the day & try not to overdo the jobs when I go into  \"mum mode\"! I also have a leaky wound on my new boob! All this aside the LD flap is one of the most successful reconstruction procedures & I'm really pleased with the natural look of my new boob.  Sharon x",
