    "Content": "Hi there I had the LD flap reconstruction in December last and have been fine since. I am quite satisfied with it after having had 3 lumpectomy ops in 2009/10 due to cancer in my right breast and in the last three years 4 ops of fat transfer taken from my belly which was a waste of time as the fatty tissues were not working. I have also had a lot of discomfort in the last few months such as nerve and muscle pulling in my breast and back pain, but l was expecting it as l was warned about it. I was told that it would last between 12 and 18 months after my op. Sorry to hear about so many unsatisfied patients. Lattice",
