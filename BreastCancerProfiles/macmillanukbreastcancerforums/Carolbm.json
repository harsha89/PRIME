    "Content": "Â Hi taralou, Thank you for your post. I personally found it really helpful. I am due to start chemo by the end of May ( I am currently recovering from a mastecotomy & reconstruction surgery. I spoke to my breast cancer care nurse yesterday & one of my question were about hair loss. I have a 2 and 4 year old so i\u2019m concerned how my appearance will affect them. Many people have suggested that if my hair falls out (probably between the first & second chemo cycle) to shave my head. After reading your post I think i\u2019ll cut it short, not completely shave it bald. Thank you again, if I hadn\u2019t read your post I would have probably shaved my head bald. Have a good day. Carol x",
