      "Content": "Well blood test done, now have to wait for 2wks for results. In the mean time I am writing a letter to my gp and also sending a copy to the Royal Marsden Hospital to see if they can shed any light. If you are wondering why I am writing a letter rather than see my gp, it's because I can write down all dates etc and explain it better. I will then make an appointment with her to discuss it. It's also gives her the chance to take it all in. I can then go over my options with my gp. Will keep you posted, as I think that maybe there are others out there that may have the same problem. Any views gratefully received.",

Thats where all the recon is done anyany so it makes sense to me. But am off to yeovil later today with suspected lymphedema in my right arm. its a bit swollen today so am off to see breast care nurse to check it out. Am seeing my GP on Friday about referral, sent her a letter explaining everything so she has time to take it all in before i get there.",

      "Content": "Hi Girls Was diagnosed with Breast cancer last year, have going through all the chemo and decided to have a bilateral mastectomy, (which my surgeon was a butcher!!!). Have now been on tamoxifen for 7 months and still have aches and pains, which i can deal with no problem. My main concern now is back in december i went to a & e with suspected DVT, which i have now had ct scan and ultrasound saying i have the all clear. However, they told that i have a very elevated D Dimer marker in my blood test. Two months on, my oncologist seems clueless as to why its so high. He just keeps sending me for blood tests and then says ring me in a fortnight for the results. The results are the same everytime! I have researched myself reasons for an elevated d-dimer, an it dosent look good. I have emailed an article today to my onc and he is going to ring me tomorrow. I feel as if i am being fobbed off and feel as if they are treating me as a number. I am not normally a depressed person but I am currently so low. Any advice would be greatly received please!",

      "Content": "Thanks for your support, its so nice to know there are people out there that care and understand how you are feeling. Still waiting for the phone call from my onc, am interested to hear what he has to say about the article i found in a medical journal. I think it will blow him out of the water. He told me not to worry about a high d dimer and just to forget about it. The link if you are interested is the following: www.haematologica.org/content/92/4/e53.full . My d dmer is higher than this poor lady in this article.",

      "Content": "Well he finally phoned me at 5pm. Just to suggest that I pop in for another blood test! It's a 50 mile round trip for me, popping in is not that easy!!!! Anyway I shall follow on in my sheep like manner. He doesn't know what to do next other than this blood test. If nothing shows up I have decided to go for a referral, then again I might just do that anyway. So I am off for a blood test tomorrow and then have to wait 2wks for the results. More stress!!",

      "Content": "Hi Helen I have just had my 2nd lot of docetaxel with one more to go in just over a weeks time. The side effects are not pleasent, yours sound very similar to my experience but i found that after the 2nd dose the pain isnt as bad as the first time. However, I mentioned to my onc about the pain and he gave my some milder steroids to try to subdue the pain, but i took one dose of those and stopped as they made me extremely angry and i felt very violent, so i hid away for the afternoon until they wore off. He also gave me tramadol which work ok and they make you sleep but be warned that you may feel spaced out for half a day the following day. As for over the counter, paracetamol and codine take the edge off i found but not brilliant. Plus codine can bung you up. Also keep check on your mucus membranes and i mean your nose to your bottom, they tend to get very raw so nappy rash cream maybe required to soothe things over. I really felt that i could do with a toilet roll in the freezer just to cool things down. Keep your mouth clean, use a soft brush so you dont make your gums bleed and swill with a mouth wash. My mouth is at the sand paper stage, taste of food slowly coming back but feels like the food i am eating is coated with sand. Ice lollies a good, they give you some relief for a short time, but relief all the same. But other than that a good soak in the bath with a ice lolly in your mouth, bliss. Hope all works well for you and this helps, I know it not full of joyful info but if it helps you get thro the crap then thats a good thing. Lou",
