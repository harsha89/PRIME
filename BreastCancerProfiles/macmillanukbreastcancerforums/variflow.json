      "Content": "I still worry when I see people around me with sniffles or feeling sick. I try to avoid them. I sometimes think I am becomming a hypochondriac....lol. But I used to get all the bugs when i was on chemo and radio therapy so I am still afraid. Its been 6 years since my last chemo and still going strong. Am still on Tamoxifen and i have been prescribed Zoladex. But hey. All for a good cause. Love Nadya",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda. well done for finishing chemo. Next to that, radio therapy is a walk in the park. At least it wad like that for me. You will still feel tired but nothing like when you were on chemo. You will soon start getting your health back. I was put underneath this massive machine with a geiger meter crackling away. Each session takes about 10 mins. The only bother I had was that I had to avoid washing off the markings and also I had a 'suntan' on my breast. Â i asked alot of questions and always got honest and correct answers. I am not saying that going through cancer is something I would do again, but to be honest its amazing how many things I learnt throughout my time under treatment. Good luck and please let me know how it goes. Xx",
