      "Content": "Hi Kiz, Thanks for that, I've had all the lymph nodes removed.  I now have to have chemo and then radiotherapy before I have my mastectomy (wasn't expecting that news I have to say!!)  did you take pain relief and if so what did you have in the weeks after surgery?  I just need to sleep! I keep doing the exercises, so hopefully it will get better. Thanks again and I hope all is well with you now?? Dianne (Daisy the dog!) x",

      "Content": "Hi Anna, I feel for you, as you describe the exact same things I'm experiencing!  I've been given tramadol for the pain, which I will take at night so that I can hopefully get some sleep (proper sleep anyway). I'm persevering with the exercises in the hopes that it will get better.  It's more the nerve pain than anything.   Feel free to chat to me if you need, as I know what you are going through. Good luck with your follow up, I hope all goes well. Dianne xx",

      "Content": "Two weeks ago tomorrow, I had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed.  I have had the follow up appointment and pathology results: stage 2 breast cancer.  The problem is the pain in my arm can be so painful. especially when the skin touches anything.  Is this nerve endings?  I would appreciate any advice from people who have had this done and have had the same problem.  Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi Anna, The tramadol is helping a bit more thanks.   You need to talk to your doctor about pain relief hun.  i also take other tablets due to having a heart attach 5 years ago this month (life certainly likes testing me....it better be worth it!) and my BP goes very low at times.  While I was in hospital my SATS also dropped due to the anaesthetic and drugs, but fortunately I'm ok (I think) at the moment. The waiting is the worst part of it all, I think, but at least you don't have much longer to wait til Monday and then you will have a plan of action!!!!! Good luck and keep in touch.  Where do you live? Love and best wishes Dianne",
