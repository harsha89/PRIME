Both my surgeon and oncologist recommended a total clearance but after doing some research I decided I didn't want this. As a result I had neo adjuvant chemo which has meant a total pathological response by my affected node (no sign of cancer now) and so I had a sentinel node biopsy on Thurs (4 nodes removed). The more I looked in to it the more I felt a total clearance was over treating. I agree with others that although NICE guidance still recommends that it seems very likely to change. Even if I hadn't had such a positive response to the chemo I still would have gone fir the SNB instead of the clearance.  Im 50 with 2 kids and the risk of lymphodaema was just too great (30%). This us reduced to 3% with SNB and so far all feels well. Do some research but the direction of axillary node treatment is changing.  Good luck",

I know it doesn't sound like the worst side effect in the scheme of things, but I can't eat or drink anything without having to quickly eat a mint afterwards (not that that helps particularly). I'm hungry and thirsty but just can't stomach anything. I'm forcing myself to drink, but it really is a struggle. Water, tea, coffee are the worst. I can just about manage elderflower tonic water which was suggested by a chemo nurse. I've read that it's a fairly common side effect, and I've had it all the way through my chemo and it does go away, but I'm hoping someone has, if not a remedy, then anything that might help.

I was told I would have an axillary node clearance as this is still the NICE guidance, however I don't want a total clearance if only 1 node is affected. When I questioned this, my surgeon said that there is now a school of thought which suggests if following new adjuvant chemo, the affected node is cancer free then only that node and the surrounding ones can be removed whilst still offering a very good recovery rate. However my oncologist, and other members of the MDT are still pushing for a total clearance. My question is, has anyone been had a partial node clearance following a positive biopsy?  TIA",

No others showed up on any scans and after my chemo there was no indication of any cancer on my scan, that\u2019s why I decided not to have the clearance. They call what I had a sentinel node biopsy even though it wasn\u2019t used to identify cancer, just to remove the affected node. They took 4 to try to make sure they got the one involved. Unfortunately for me they can\u2019t be sure they got the affected node as the clip inserted before chemo wasn\u2019t found, and there was no sign that any of the nodes removed had ever had cancer. I have still made the decision not to have a clearance, which is what has been recommended  but now have to decide whether to have radiotherapy to my lymph and lower neck. Again I\u2019m reluctant as I\u2019m feeling very positive about the treatment I\u2019ve had so far, but it\u2019s something I will have to consider. I\u2019m actually at the hospital now waiting to get my CT scan prior to radiotherapy so will have to make my mind up soon.  These decisions are really difficult, I hope you can come to a decision you feel comfortable with.

      "Content": "Hi Fiona,  Have you had a scan following your chemo? I ask because your situation sounds very similar to mine and I chose not to have an axillary node clearance. My chemo was very effective (complete pathological response in my lymph) and so I chose to have a sentinel node biopsy to remove only the lymph nodes that were affected by the chemo. I was also very concerned about lymphodaema and so did some research and found that there is a School of thought that an ANC in some patients is overtreating. I know everyone is different, and I would never suggest you chose one course of action over another, but it may be worth speaking to your oncologist/surgeon. The ANC is a belt and braces/very risk averse decision and I didn\u2019t feel that in my particular case it was necessary. I have been offered radiotherapy on my armpit, but as this also increases the risk of lymphodaema I have decided not to go for that either. I was told with ANC there is a 30% chance if some form of lymphodaema (from very mild to serious) which is reduced to 3% with a SNB. Whatever you decide, I hope your treatment and surgery goes well.

I'm having my final chemo session on Tuesday, but halfway through I had an MRI that showed minimal response to the chemo. However I've switched to herceptin, pertuzemab and docetaxel and my oncologist felt this would be more effective. The strain you're on is probably what I would have opted for, but if the chemo isn't effective then a ckearance will be my only option. I haven't heard of the trial you're on, I'll mention it at my appt on Monday. I'm sure you'll be able to withdraw from the trial and choose one of the other treatment options if you're worried, the trials are great, but you need to be certain it's right for you. I feel like I'm getting mixed messages from different professionals, so also feel like I'm not in possession of the full, unadulterated facts.  I was quite. Retain that I wanted bi lateral surgery (with reconstruction) and a partial nude clearance, but at an appt I was at on Friday a surgeon I hadn't met before was talking about a mastectomy, which I was told initially I didn't need. I'm goi g to insist on seeing my notes I think and meeting with everyone rather than individuals as I'm finding it all very confusing and frustrating. Good luck with what you decide.

It looks like my team will push for a clearance, as the initial scan half way through my chemo showed a minimal response unfortunately. However I will still be looking at alternatives such as partial clearance with radiotherapy if there is still cancer present following completion of my chemo.  Read Helen's post on the trial she is doing, there is clearly an appetite to consider, and research alternatives to an ancillary node clearance. I'm meeting with my surgeon on 21st September, but will be speaking with my breast care nurse to consider my options before then. I'll keep you posted. Good luck with making your decision, and with finding a surgeon who will at least consider your wishes. FYI, everyone else on my multi disciplinary team feels a total ckearance is the only safe option and is current NICE guidance. X",

I did some research and chose not to have a full clearance, although this is still the current guidance.  I had neo adjuvant chemo and had a complete pathological response in my lymph area (no cancer found after chemo) and my breast lump had shrunk from 3.5 cms to 0.5mm so a negligible size which was removed in October. I had a SNB which removed the first 4 draining nodes. I'm also on herceptin injections for a year. I feel confident that the treatment I have had so far is sufficient and anything more would be overtreating and risk averse. Now clearly, our circumstances may be very different, and as I say, the guidance is still to have a clearance, but I just wanted to mention that there is a growing school of thought that a blanket instruction to do an axillary node clearance in all cases may be unnecessary. You may want to chat to your medical team, or have a look online.  If not, and you chose to have the clearance, I hope it goes well and your NY celebrations aren't delayed by too much x",

Chemo is a systemic treatment-in case any of the little buggers are floating around elsewhere-DCIS, as per the name only affects the breast ducts, it doesn't wander. You will have the lump removed and radiotherapy to make sure there's none lurking in the ducts (this is info I received following my dcis diagnosis). I also had a cancerous lump so had to have chemo, but tbh, it was far less traumatic than I thought it would be. Not fun, inconvenient, tiring, but not what it once was. I had my therapeutic mamoplasty on Thursday (lump removed plus reconstruction) plus a matching reduction on the other side, and so far that has also been much easier to manage than I thought.  I really hope it works out and try (easier said than done) not to worry too much.",
