      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer in February, and started chemo in March. I had 3 rounds of fec - t and then 3 of herceptin, pertuzamab, and dosetaxal. Was given many options for surgery, after much discussion I opted for a tummy DIEp flap and this was agreed, but seems to have taken along time to organise. Just wondered if anyone else has been in a similar situation.",

      "Content": "Thanks it is good to hear what others have gone through. I\u2019ve already had my chemo, to reduce one of the tumours but it\u2019s un clear as to weather I\u2019ll need radiotherapy. I tried the cold cap but my hair was coming out just before my second session, carried on with it but the day after round 2it went very crispy, so I didn\u2019t bother again. I update after surgery.",
