Thank you so much for sharing your experience..aware that other hospitals might be different.  I was told 2-3 weeks after appt I\u2019d get first chemo... but they said that about this first appointment which has come through a week later!  No no doubt I\u2019ll be back with more questions that I didn\u2019t ask at the time....",

      "Content": "Hi all... looking to get peoples experiences, appreciate they will all be different but how long after finishing chemo was it before you started radiotherapy?  Im currently having chemo, (EC then docetaxel) and have been told I will need radiotherapy afterwards, but didn\u2019t think to ask at the time how long it will be after finishing chemo  before I start radiotherapy.... so would appreciate any experiences!  Ive left a message for the Breast care nurses, but they\u2019re not the best at calling back form experience, and with it being a bank holiday i suspect it will be even longer! I do have an oncologist appt on Thursday, but don\u2019t like waiting !  Many thanks..  ",
