It says if it is pain without lump it should be a non-urgent referral and doesn't specify a time limit. For all other symptoms listed it should be the 2 week referral route.Good luck.",

      "Content": "I was referred on the 2 week fast track even though my GP thought the lump was nothing to worry about. Try going back to your GP and asking about the initiative, as I thought all women with symptoms should be seen within 2 weeks, but perhaps I'm wrong. Have you thought of calling Cancer Backup or Breast Cancer Care and asking their advice?",
