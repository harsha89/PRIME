    "Content": "Hi there I too have had two teeth out this year after surgery and radiotherapy. My dentist had a really good explanation.  She said that both teeth had had a slight residual infection following poor root canal work years ago, but when I was fit and healthy my immune system kept it under check.  As I was very tired and run down following treatement the infections flared up.  They calmed down under antibiotics but she said it was probably best to get them out.  So I think you could probably apply the same logic to your root canal treatment.  Your body was probably keeping it in check but couldn't cope with everything else going on Hope this helps Ing   ",
