      "Content": "HI, I had a mastectomy and reconstruction. I am pain free and will be in the gym with my trainer tomorrow.... who makes NO allowances .... I train the same as I did before cancer!!! I had a tissue expander (I trained with that) and then a silicone implant replaced that... I also had an augmentation to the other side as I was too small to try to match. There is post op pain, but then it goes, in my experience. Training in the gym really helps. I know quite q few people in the same situation and long term pain doesn't seem t be a problem. We all agree that it doesn't feel the same as efore, but your body accepts this as it's new norm eventually. Good luck with your op. EJ x",

      "Content": "Hi, I had mastectomy and recontruction in August 2006. I never wore a bra to bed, but was very small AA cup. I had my tissue expander switched for silicone in Sept and went up a couple of sizes.. on both sides (as they couldn't get a symmetrical result in such a small size). Again, no bra to bed.... I am now wearing a totally fancy lace bra.... and haven't even taken out the underwire..... I guess what I'm trying to say is do what feels best for you without totally ignoring medical advice (this maxim has been mine for all my treatment). My plastic surgeon is all for doing what feels right, but others can be more rigid in their approach. As a physio, I always tell people to listen to their bodies.... why should this be different? Is this the end of your treatment? if so, well done.... if not, good luck! Love EJ",
