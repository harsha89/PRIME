    "Content": "Hi regarding the taste buds being up the shoot, my hubby had AML and had the same problem as many chemo sufferers do he found that the stronger tasting the food the more he could taste, which is quite logical when you think of it, so have you tried curries, strong cheese etc etc? i think it is a very personal choice as to what to try and is very much trying lots of different things to find the ones that are acceptable to your taste buds at that time. I can remember on many occasions him looking forward to a particular food, then on trying it his face dropping as it did not taste as it should,i used to feel so sorry for him as he was so looking forward to it. Have you tried build up drinks? which are good when you cannot find anything you fancy or that taste right? marmite was an ok food but not that good in the calorie dept. Good luck in finding what is ok and what is not but you are not alone, sampling is the way to go lol fudgecakexx",
