    "Content": "Hi Penny, It got me 9 years ago, had a lumpectomy and then 30 radiation treatments, and was fine till late last year. It did come back, but still in the same breast and after mastectomy and chemo doing really well. So it is NOT going to get you for a long while - depending on your age of course!! Fight it all the way,, I have kept my hair through the chemo by using the cold cap method and have not suffered any sickness, just a wee bit of nausea. Tiredness does get you a bit but pace yourself. This is my first email so I hope I am helping. If I can give you any support please contact me. It is actually 3.45 am here in Cape Town where I live but the one problem I have after a chemo treatment is that I can't sleep due to the cortisone they give me to counteract the nausea! So here I am trying out this site!!! Wish I was young enough to go clubbing! Good luck and I would love to hear from you. Lindy",
