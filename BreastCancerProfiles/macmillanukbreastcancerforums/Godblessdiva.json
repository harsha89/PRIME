      "Content": "Hi, I opted for mastectomy with immediate silicon reconstruction. It\u2019s been 4 weeks since surgery and I have recovered well. The first week is a bit painful and uncomfortable but from the 2nd week onwards I had stopped taking any pain medication also. With clothes on no one can tell the difference and I am happy with my decision",

Seeking your advice as to how do we get the actual scan reports with images for mri,ultrasound,pet scans. I do get marked in all the letters from the doctors but require my scan reports. I have requested the nurses and the doctors but it seems to have been ignored Thanks",
