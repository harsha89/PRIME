      "Content": "Hi Everyone I am waiting for fec chemo which starts on the16th nov. I had a stage 2 grade 3 taken out by lumpectomy. The results were both er and pr sensitive and i was shocked to be told i would need chemo as only 43 and am single with 3 children (well actually 5 children but 2 have grown up). \" things keep going through my head...1. my hair!!!! 2... i worry about my children seeing me unwell and not coping they are 5,11 and 14, boy girl girl respectively. Have been told to give up work as a childminder (and germs) and cant as i am the only one paying the mortgage. I am not losing the house i have worked so hard to keep for us all as well as a part of my breast and my hair!!! here is hoping i get very small side effects as i would wish all others xx Tracey  ",

I have got another childminder on back up and all parents are happy and my children all know what is going on and have been very supportive and thank god seem ok. I am so happy that we were all very calm and laid back before this all came along as we have all taken this well and not dropped any of us into despair!!! Now the rest is up to my body and how it copes and i am going to take each day as it comes . I wish everyone good luck xxxx  ",
