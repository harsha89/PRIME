      "Content": "Thanks so much for taking the time to reply. I can cope with it although very tight and uncomfortable rather than painful but they have just said to keep getting it drained but ive read conflicting info. Just dont want it to overfill but on other hand will suffer it if know it will eventually drain away naturally. Have just seen most people only have this for few weeks and not few months like this.",

      "Content": "Hi. Im hoping for some reassurance as still have a seroma that keeps refilling 5 months after surgery. I have to have it drained every few weeks and get 1200mls out of it each time. I just cant see any end to it although have been told it should stop eventually but it just isnt reducing. Will it ever stop? Thanks for listening.",
