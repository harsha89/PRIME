    "Content": "Hi there, I found a lump at the end of October, which turned out to be a harmless cyst, however there was a fibroadenoma behind it, core biopsy found ADH. I saw a lovely onco plastic surgeon who said the protocol was for an excision biopsy to check there was nothing else of concern in the area. Intermediate grade DCIS was found, but as it was some way away from the original core biopsy track, the surgeon wanted to do another re excision to make sure margins were clear. This was Done on Dec 5th, I've recovered well, and I saw the surgeon for the results on the 19th Dec. She found another small speck of low grade DCIS during the second surgery. I've been referred to see an oncologist in January, but the surgeon said the recommendation from the MDT was not to have radiotherapy. I'm really really anxious about this decision, I don't fully understand why. Everything has happened so quickly, one minute I was fine, getting ready to move house, running around after my children, and working full time, next minute I'm having two lots of surgery, and being told \" it's not cancer so don't worry\" everything I've read about DCIS suggests radiotherapy is standard of care, I've only just turned 40 and if I'm honest im completely thrown by the whole thing. I'm not sleeping well, I'm worried that if I don't have radiotherapy DCIS ir invasive BC will develop, and if I do have it- there are potential complications as its my left breast. I'm sorry to whittle and whinge, I feel a bit of a fraud as its not real cancer.but at the same time, I'm terrified that it could be in the future and radiotherapy after the surgery gives the best long term outcome. I'm frantic with worry not knowing why it hasn't been recommended. The lovely surgeon did say something about an MRI, but I can't remember what, or why. Can anyone share their experiences or shed any light? I'm so grateful this forum exists , I don't want to bother anyone else with it, as I said, I feel like a fraud.",
