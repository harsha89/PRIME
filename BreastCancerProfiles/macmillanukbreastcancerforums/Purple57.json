    "Content": "I would deffinaty not fly whilst doing chemo. I doubt you would get travel insurance to cover you whilst you are being treated. Better to have something to look forward to after treatment. I used to go away for a weekend just before the next treatment (had 6 fec t) one every four weeks. I was at my best just before the next treatment. It got me through it. Good luckÂ ",
