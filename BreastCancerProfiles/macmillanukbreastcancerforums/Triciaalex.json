      "Content": "Awh Linn ... it\u2019s a horrible feeling when they tell you one thing and then another. I had 2 Operations to remove my lump and ended up with a weird looking breast. It was 3 sizes smaller than the other but after all the surgery and radio I was too scared to have the op to correct it. Â I finally had it last week after 8 years and it was a double as they reduced the other at the same time. Luckily my surgeon was able to save the nipples. Speak to your consultant again in the new year...... trust his judgement ... he probably doesn\u2019t want to put you through the pain and trauma and the outcome not be up to your expectations. It may be worth seeing a plastic surgeon for a second opinion..... then you can decided what would be best for you. Xx",

      "Content": "Hiya ... I had those for 18 months. I did feel a little bit sick for a few days after the injection but after a few months I was fine with them. However, I did develop the aching joints side effect which was a nightmare but pain killers did help. But anything that helps ... You gotta go with. Xx",
