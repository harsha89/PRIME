      "Content": "I\u2019ve been diagnosed with widespread cancer in my left breast and have been told I need to have a full mastectomy.  I have told my breast nurse today that I would like tk have my right breast also removed and have identical implants put in both breasts.  She does not think the surgeon will agree, but I\u2019m keen to find out if anyone else got this done on the NHS. I am not positive for the cancer gene.  My reasons are as follows: 1. I have very high anxiety levels, and I am terrifed the cancer will recur in my other breast in the next few years and I will have to go through this all again.  2. I am diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome and Sensory Processing Disorder. I need to have symmetry in my life: both the way things look and the way things feel. I am extremely sensitive to tiny changes in feeling or sensations. I am absolutely terrfied that if i just have one mastectomy and implant, but keep my other breast that I will not be able to manage this psychologically. I an not in a good place with my mental health as things are.  3. I am also a single mum and my kids are very little. My parents live 300 miles away and are getting old. This time my mum has come to help me, but if the whole thing happened again in the future she might not be able to do this, and I would have no support through this.  Any advice here gladly welcome. I\u2019m on the verge of walking away and not having any treatment right now, because of how scared I am. ",

      "Content": "Thank you.  Did you have yours done as a bilateral at the same time or did they make you wait for the healthy breast to be done? Also did the process hold things up? How long did it take to get the second opinion and was that from another surgeon? Did you see a psychologist too? I\u2019m already one month on from my initial diagnosis at the moment. ",

      "Content": "I was discharged Thursday after bilateral mastectomy and implant reconstruction.  My left side is draining well, and my right drain is blocked so nothing coming out since before discharge.  I went back yesterday morning and saw a breast nurse who said that it was blocked with fat, and confirmed that my right side is filling up with liquid inside.  She booked me in for an ultrasound aspiration on Monday.  So I\u2019ve just got to wait over the weekend. My right boob is getting bigger and bigger with fluid and it\u2019s really tight and painful.  I\u2019m scared that this will affect my shape. My surgeon had done a really good job with two equal boobs, and now this one looks like a balloon.  Has this happened to anyone else? Can anyone tell me about the ultrasound aspiration procedure? Can they unblock my drains? Is this going to leave me with a saggy messed up boob afterwards?  Fed up and in pain and stressed. Need some virtual hugs from other BC ladies of there. ",
