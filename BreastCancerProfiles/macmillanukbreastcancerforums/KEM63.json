      "Content": "Hi all I was diagnosed with bc in Sept - l 've had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy and will have 4 more sessions of Zemeta infusion over the next 2 years. I am gradually improving my physical and mental stamina but as l have other health issues this l suspect will be a slow process. When l was diagnosed l had lots of offers of support - some turned out to be genuine. But since l completed my radiothetapy l get the feeling some of my family and friends are getting abit \"bored\" of my illness. I don't feel l over emphasis the struggles l have and l try to present a positive face. I only discuss bc when asked. But l still need support as does my husband and l feel like \"yesterday' news\" with some long standing \"friends\" - has anyone else found this ?",

Well l found you do and it' a surprise who they are!  I have decided to cherish them and be glad my relationships are defined so l don' waste too much energy on the \"wrong\" people. I' doing ok thanks. Al the best for your radiotherapy. It is tiring so be kind to yourself and moisturiser the treated areas until you can' do any more. K x",

Don't remember her speaking about it on the breast area but then again l seem to remember so little of what professionals say! Hence lake my husband usually now to take notes! xx",

      "Content": "Hi all. First annual check up post lumpectomy. I had a mamagram and saw consultant who said \"as far as she could see it was all clear(?) But the results had to go to a radiologist to be checked and ld hear in a couple of weeks\". Has anyone else had this response? Left me feeling anxious again.Also she said l had lymphodema of the breast and gave me some massage techniques to do - just line drawings. Some involve having a helper and they need to be done 3 x daily? Any experience of this technique would be appreciated.",
