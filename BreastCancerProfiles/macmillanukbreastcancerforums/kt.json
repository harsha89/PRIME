    "Content": "Hi Louise, I just wanted to say I totally agree with Jools, if it increases your chances I strongly suggest you go for it, what's a few months more treatment in the view of your life. I too had a similar choice to make, I was on a trial and on the second part of treatment after surgery I was randomised to 30 weeks instead of 20 weeks more chemo and two more strong drugs added in. I could have pulled out of the trial anytime I wished but I trusted that the people who trialled these drugs and all the research was saying that they might of thought this extra treatment could prevent reaccurance, so I trusted them and had the extra. There were times when I could have so pulled out but I stuck through it and now I'm glad and hope those extra months helped in the long run. I hope you make the right decision. All the best, Katie.",
