    "Content": "Hi Susann, I had a bone scan a couple of weeks ago. I went for my onc appointment as I am on oral chemo at the moment.He gave me the results and said I had a 'hot spot' on my right distal femur (top of my leg). He sent me for an x-ray during the appointment and then said it looked ok but couldn't confirm this until he got the radiographers report. I worried for a few weeks until my next appointment. He then told me this was a benign tumour and nothing to worry about, I asked him how he can be sure without a biopsy and he said they are used to looking at these things. I have confidence in them but went away wondering how I have got a tumour in my leg,where did it come from etc. but I am not going to worry anymore, I am sure they know whats best. Hope all goes well with your treatment. Jo x",
