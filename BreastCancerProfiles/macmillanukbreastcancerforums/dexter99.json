      "Content": "I had the first of 4/4 chemos of this on Monday , and the last 36 hrs. have been horrendous : pains in legs , not able to walk properly , barely intermittent sleep with constant stabbing pains and back-ache , sore throat . When I next meet with oncologist what should I ask for to help with this , and is there anything I can get from a pharmacy today that will help ? thanks Helen",

      "Content": "Following an ultra-sound showing an 84% reduction in tumour ( now 13.5 m.m. x 7.6 x 5,3 ; stage 3 growth ) I met with surgeon , who said although I had responded well to chemotherapy - 4 of Epiburicin , and 2 of Docetaxel with 2 to go - I would have an MRI   mid-June to see if any cancer cells that were undetected by the MRI I had in January had grown , in which case I would have a masectomy and not a lumpectomy . How could cancer cells proliferate whilst the chemo regime has decimated the tumour ?  I'd be grateful if anyone can explain , thanks .",
