      "Content": "Hi  I've had the miseries as well. I've managed to stay quite upbeat up till now. I had my last chemo 12 days ago and the last couple of cycles have been emotionally more difficult. Now that it's all over (that is how I think many people see it) we are meant to bounce back to normal. I've found that some of my family avoid talking to me about how I feel, they simply change the subject... I have only just realised that most people don't really want to know too much not matter how positive your outlook or attitude, it feels so isolating, I should have joined this group sooner. Don't get me wrong, I have amazing friends and family, they are all very supportive and caring but I think treatment takes so long their empathy dwindles a little.  The truth is that, for me anyway, being in the system, getting treatment, having regular contact with medical staff is very supportive and the idea of loosing that regular contact is quite daunting. I'm sure this forum will be good to be part of then and I will go to the local force centre for the monthly support group so I am sure it will be absolutely fine. I seem to be experiencing a real contradiction in feelings and wants, on one hand I can't wait to put all this behind me and being 'normal' and on the other I'm concerned about coping with 'normal' with all those fears clamoring in the back of my thooughts....I''m sure that this too is not uncommon.  I hope you ladies had a good Christmas",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, what pain for u, to itch and not feel the scratch sounds horrible   I'm desperately trying not to scratch but .... It's also tricky to know who to call, during chemo it would be the nurses and doctors there but I guess that's not the place if chemo is finished and I doubt the oncologist is the person to call about this....I have emailed my breast nurse today but she often doesn't reply. I'll try call the chemo unit and they can direct me in the right place I'm sure.  I really expected that side effects would lessen and that we wouldn't have new ones crop up now :/ ah, how naive I was  ",

      "Content": "HI  I had my last chemo in December (25 days ago). My skin has been really amazing through chemo, no dryness except that my hands are sensitive so I wear gloves to cook, wash up and clean but suddenly I have broken out in a rash on my face, around my nose and mouth and now on my neck. This happened about 5 days ago. It seems to be mainly red and the skin feels leathery and the itch is awful, it wakes me up at night. also my eyes are very scratchy. I'm not sure what it is, could it be caused by the chemo? Is it possible to have new side effects at this point? I have been putting aloe vera on it. That makes it burn like hell but it helps with the itch....but of course as the aloe gel dries I look like a scaly monster so I can only use that in the privacy of my own home...what can it be? Have any of you ladies had the same issue? What can I do?  Itchy-scratchy-Leona ",

      "Content": "Hi YorkA I was diagnosed in June, my lump didn't show up on a mammogram at all, the doctor who did the ultrasound said he doubted it was anything to worry about and even gave me a pamphlet about benign lumps, it turned out to be grad 3 tripple negative and ER+, rolled into one  but initially they thought it was only ER+ they found out about the tripple negative after the Oncotype DX test. Will you have that done? Had it been offered?  I think the shock of my diagnosis kept me a bit numb to it all until recently, dealing with the fear is tricky but this forum seems really good support, you are very wise to sign up here so early, I wish I had. I only signed up a couple of days ago. This whole thing is so isolating and this forum makes it less so.  On a positive note the treatment goes really fast, I had my last treatment on the 18th of December and all the NHS staff are amazing and supportive. You are not alone YorkA, keep talking about it, on here, to you BC nurse, to who ever u feel comfortable with, it does the world of good. Leona ",

      "Content": "HI Ladies I have just finished my last cycle 12 days ago. I had long and very think curly dark hair and also wasn't sure what to do about it as I wanted to enjoy it for as long as possible. I landed up shaving it off on a number 4 clipper guard two weeks after my first treatment. My advice would be to cut if off if you can bear it, shave it if you can. Here is why: two weeks after my first cycle my scalp started hurting and itching. It felt as if I had had my hair in a very tight pony and moving it was agony, the relief when I shaved it off was huge. It was still weird seeing it all fall out, I used to put my head over the bath everytime I went into the bathroom and rubbed all the little hairs off, it looked strange but to be honest loosing my hair didn't upset me as much as I thought it would, it's a small price to pay in the big scheme of things. I am a hairdresser and loved my long hair so I really was surprised that I don't mind walking around with my head uncovered. My hair started growing back before my last treatment and now I boast a downy head of fuzz, I am immensely proud and delighted with it.  Good luck with your treatment.  ps I have asked to join a tripple negative FB group but was never excepted, I have not heard from them at all  ",
