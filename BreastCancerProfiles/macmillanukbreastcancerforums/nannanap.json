      "Content": "Sat here feeling all warm and fuzzy from your lovely message ( granted partly due to a shot of  liquid morphine too after my op today ). Isn't it amazing how such scary thing like cancer with all that it can throw at us can bring forth so much love, support,,joy, hope and laughs. I am sure someone once said we need the dark so the light can shine through and here on this site that light shines at it's brightest. and best. So happy I found you guys such an inspiration. Thinking of making a badge in honour of my membership to the blue tit club. xxxxxx",

      "Content": "I am not a big fan of stats because like you say who knows where anyone falls within them - there are no crystal balls. When it comes down to it faced with the ball being put in your court it is about how you feel - would you feel better going through chemo knowing you had thrown everything at it or are you confident that with all the support and radiotherapy and tamoxifen and regular check-ups/awareness that chemo would just be unnecessary overload. It is only recently that people in this situation had a choice - a couple of years back and it would have been chemo no question. I am waiting for my oncotype dx result and have decided that if it is a middling result and I get a say then I will have the chemo as my cancer is grade 3 and an aggressive little thing and because I am a natural worrier so know if I don't have it it will pray on my mind afterwards but everyone is different - in this situation how you feel is more important than statistics I would say. Hope this is of some help and by crikey waiting for the result is driving me round the bend - I just want to get on with it all - well follow-up op for me tomorrow so best get that out of the way first. I am sure with all the great support on here you will be able to decide what is right for you. Rooting for ya. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Maxine I can definitely relate to the tiredness thing. For months before my diagnosis I was feeling wiped out most of the time - I would come home from work and flake out on the sofa and on trips out I would be drained within half an hour. It got to the point where I ended up seeing a doctor but nothing came of it. It was a routine breast screening for me that caught the cancer. The body is a strange thing and I really believe that my abnormal tiredness was my body telling me something was wrong. On the plus side getting a diagnosis has strangely really helped me re-evaluate things. I have improved my diet and also am taking a positive approach to everything this cancer and its treatments will fling at me. I think something like dealing with cancer changes a person and for many coming out the other side it is a change for the better - it is a tough trip but hang on in there. Top tip - bananas - I always have one in my bag when I go out ready to munch on if I start flagging.",

      "Content": "well 5th August 2017 that was a day and a half. so start the day at 6.30am - I was beginning to forget what that time of day looked like and off for my follow-up WLE. It seem as time goes on with this thing I have been becoming more ok with it. The absolute worst day was my first call back to Poole after my routine screening - shaking like a leaf, mind whizzing what had they found - was it going to be horrendous or something of nothing - I had no idea. But now armed with my diagnosis and understanding much more what it is all about these trips out are becoming more of an  ' all in a days work thing' - so put in a full day of waiting, op and recovery - managed to read a book this time while waiting a true sign I am chillin with this thing now that I can relax and read for pleasure again. And on the road home - out of the blue a thought popped in my head - I began to think of my youngest daughter and her boyfriend and I was sayin  ' walk away NOW ' - odd no reason for thinking that. Back home and relaxation time - lovely salmon and veg tea - only managed half of it but feeling fine if just a bit woozy. and then the message from my eldest daughter - Ring me NOW EMERGENCY - oh god!. My youngest daughter had rung the police and told hem her boyfriend had taken her in his car and was threatening to kill both of them by driving off a bridge and now her phone was dead - FRANTIC - messaging trying to get his detail car reg etc so they could be found - I am 300 miles away from the whole thing. Hubby telling me I don't need all this stress and concerned for me ' It will just be a tiff and blown over in 5 minutes' he said - And I am out of my mind for my daughter. Eventually she managed to to get home and I got through to her on the phone - she was totally distressed but safe - thank God. Eventually after calming the whole thing down - don't know the story yet as my daughter waiting for the police to take statement and she needed to rest and recover. so up to bed - here I am at 50  - came off the pill when this thing started - and behold my bedtime treat - for the first time in years I was flying the japanese flag - marvellous!  Where's the chocolate! xxxx",
