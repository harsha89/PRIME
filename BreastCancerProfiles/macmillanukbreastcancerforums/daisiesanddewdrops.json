    "Content": "Hi everyone... Just looking for a bit of advice really. I had a large reddened area which was extremely painful to touch and after 3 days the redness disappeared and I found a small hard non moveable lump on the side of my breast (about 3 weeks ago now) and visited the GP after about 4 days of putting it off.  He seemed to think it was a swollen lymph node and referred me to the breast clinic (2wk turnaround) however with Easter it's now 2 weeks today since I was referred and I've still not had an appointment so will chase up tomorrow.  However the lump which was easy to find and could be seen is now a lot harder to find but I feel as if the surrounding area is just thick. Like tough muscle. It's so strange I can't explain fully how it feels. But it doesn't feel normal anymore.  Hopefully I'll get an appointment soon and everything will be fine but I just wondered if anyone had any similar experiences? I'm 27 with 2 kids, no BC history but a lot of other cancer in the family especially with my father (bowel and prostate).  Ps I'm sorry if I've posted this in the wrong area! Thank you x",
