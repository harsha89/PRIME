      "Content": "I talked to the consultant about the facial hair and he said that he hadn't heard of it being a side effect, but he would not rule it out at the moment as \"some funny things can happen.\"  He has taken me off the Arimidex and put me onto Tamoxifen to see if that makes a difference.  This is not too bad anyway because as I have osteoarthritis the Tamoxifen will strengthen bones rather than the Arimidex which can weaken bones.  If there is no change I will need to see an endocrinologist to check hormone levels and investigate other reasons. Sue, with this information it might be worth speaking to your GP as the Arimidex is not the reason in your case.  As I started the Arimidex one month after chemo finished I am not sure when the facial hair started.  (I too am now 4 months post chemo.)

      "Content": "Hi, I am new to the group, and I hope to get to know you all. I have a question about a side effect I am getting with the oestrogen inhibitor Arimidex.  I have looked on the internet but am unable to find any information about this particular problem.  The side effect is that I am getting excessive growth of facial hair, so much so that I am now having to shave.  It has been noticed and I am finding this quite embarrasing.  Has anybody else had this problem?  ",
