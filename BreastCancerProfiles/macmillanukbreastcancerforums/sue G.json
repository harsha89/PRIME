Like you I had had 3 lots of antibiotics but my cough was no better. Had a bronchoscopy which takes samples of the fluid and that came back as nothing sinister. Had another CT scan 4 months later and it came back clear. You will be given a CT scan I am sure and perhaps what I had too.  It is so hard not to think the cancer has returned but try not to panic.  One of my friends on the site had lung cancer and was not well enough for chemo. He is still goung strong 10 years later. I have 4 small grandchildren and I hope I can see them grow up All the very best. Sue xxx",

I think mine was 9 hours but of course I didn't know at the time. I had the op on a Thursday and came out on the Sunday. No drains. The results were very good and looked natural. In April this year I had the implant removed and replaced due to capsular contracture . This can happen at any time and I had eight years before it happened. All implants may need to be replaced at some time.  I haven't had any problem with weakness in my back as I am not a sporty type but can lift my grandchildren up which is what matters to me. Perhaps your surgeon can introduce you to some ladies who have had this procedure done.  All the very best with your decision. No pain no gain. Love Sue Diagnosed 22/2/2008",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissi. I had today a questionnaire from the Royal College of Surgeons aimed at women who have had mastectomies. i volunteered to complete these when I was first diagnosed. I completed one last year and have just completed this one ready to post. One of the questions was If you could choose again would you opt for reconstruction at the same time as the mastectomy. Could answer Yes No or Not Sure. I wrote I was told I could not have one as I would have to have radiotherapy. I still am not happy that I was told I could not have it done. My surgeon in Worcester did not seem 100% behind reconstructions so that is why I am having mine done in Birmingham.    They do not realise it would give you such a boost to your confidence if they would do the reconstruction.  I hope you get a satisfactory answer. These questionnaires were created because so few women had reconstructions after mastectomy. They are looking for answers as to why this should be. I hope they follow up on my answer. All the best Sue x x x",

      "Content": "Hi Crissi I know how you feel to want to look normal again. I had a mastectomy in April 08 followed by chemo and RT. My treatment finished in Nov 08. Was told I could not have a reconstruction for 12 months after RT. I have seen Mr Guy Sterne at the City Hospital in Birmingham twice in the last few months and I got a letter this week saying that I was on the list for early in the New Year. Although City Hospital is not my local hospital I have been recommended to him and have seen some reconstructions he has done and the results were amazing. I think you have to ask the question. Can I have a reconstruction even tho I have been diagnosed with secondary BC, i know you want this more than anything. Would make up somewhat for all the treatment you have been through. I wish you the best of luck and hope everything works out for you. Lots of Love Sue x x x x     ",

I have just completed 10 years of taking Arimidex I  have had annual mammograms and an examination by the BC Consultant. If I had any concerns or pain I was given a bone scan or CT scan.

I convinced myself  that the cancer had spread to my bones. I went to my GP who referred me back to the breast cancer consultant who arranged for a bone scan to put my mind at rest. It came back clear and it appears my rib pain is due to the radiotherapy. Have a word with your GP again and ask if you can have a bone/ CT scan. I do have pains in my right side too at times. Seems it is coming out in sympathy with my left side. Looking at previous posts this is common. Good luck. No good telling you to ignore these pains as you need confirmation that everything is ok.

I then had 6 sessions of chemo and 13 rounds of radiotherapy. I went on to have breast reconstruction 2 years after diagnosis. I am 10 years no evidence of disease on 22nd Feb. Don't write your Mum off yet. She will be well looked after and will be given the treatment to fight this disease. I had a CT and bone scan prior to surgery to make sure there was no spread.

I was diagnosed in 2008 with lobular breast cancer. Tests showed my lymph nodes had cancer cells so I had a mastectomy and clearance of the axilla. Had a CT scan and a bone scan prior to my surgery. Wondering if it had spread was so scary. I have used this forum many times as any worries and concerns I have I can share on here. Didn't feel I wanted to tell my nearest and dearest for fear of upsetting them.  Only those who have had a cancer diagnosis can know how it feels. All the very best for Friday.  I am still here after 9 years having been through surgery chemo and rads followed by a reconstruction. Sue xx",

I slept on my back from the start with the aid of a V shaped pillow. I also had a silk fitted sheet on the bed which allowed me to move easier. It was a weird feeling in my back like  being impailed with a wooden broom handle. Will be interested if you have the same sensation. I came out of hospital without any drains and had a District Nurse visit me to change dressings for a few weeks. This may have been a luxury no longer available as my op was in 2010. The only difference I found was that it was more difficult to swim. I kept tipping over!! All the best for Monday Love Sue",

      "Content": "Hi Meg. I had breast cancer last year and had a mastectomy, chemo and RT. i finished treatment in Nov 08 and now facing a reconstruction in the New Year. Sorry to hear about the diagnosis and at such a young age too. I was in chemo with a girl of 27 who had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. She had just got maried too and had eggs harvested in the hope she can have a family after 5 years. Your daughter and her husband should go ahead with their plans as I know it is hard but life does go on. I was very jealous of my friends leading normal lives and going on holiday etc but when my treatment is finally over I will have to make up for lost time. Families are funny things. My sister who lives in the Lake District which is about 230 miles away has been so supportive and has come down and looked after me after my op and after my last chemo. My brother who lives 2 miles away has not even bought me a bunch of flowers. He rings very occassionally and asks how I am. Just says you know where we are if you need me. I am a positive person but if I heard anyone else say stay positive I would have screamed. It isn't easy when you are frightened. Hope the treatment goes well. Hope your son in law reguarly goes to see his sister. Your daughter could perhaps take her shopping or help by cooking a few meals for her. It is a lonely time and she will need all the support she can get. As you say there are no easy answers. Good Luck. Suexxxx       ",

I opted for a LD reconstruction with implant to my left breast and another implant to my good right breast to match. Only one operation . Consider your lifestyle. Do you need to lift anything or play sports?  If so you may consider a tram flap and not LD recon. Your surgeon will discuss the options and it may depend on your body type and what your expectations are. My LD flap was very successful and looked good. After 7 years my implant has a capsular contracture and I am due to have the implant removed and replaced. Surgeon says I will be a day case. Knowing the NHS I will have to wait for this for months rather than weeks. Choose your plastic surgeon carefully.  I opted for one after recommendations from fellow breast cancer suffers.  My reconstruction was carried out in Birmingham. Sue xxx",

Perhaps you could have your first chemo that way and see how you get on. A lot of ladies have the portocath and will be able to tell you what it is like. As regards the cold cap i would go for it. It was not available at my hospital so I had no choice. I lost my hair just before my second chemo. Went to get my wig before chemo so I could match it with my own hair and style. I must say the wig I got was so good that friends thought it was my own hair. I had my own hair cut short just as the hair was startng to fall out but then had it shaved as the remaining hairs came out all over the place and I preferred to get rid of it. Strangly liberating. I am 2 years on from my first chemo and my hair is thicker than ever and back to what it was. Good luck for 28th. I know you are scared but the chemo will not be as bad as you fear. You will have lots of support from the ladies on the site who have gone through the treatment and can support you every step of the way. Love Sue xxxxx ",

Have an annual mammogram on my remaining breast every year since and they have always come back clear. Have been having pains in my chest and back so am having a bone scan next week.  Had  3 before. I when I was first diagnosed, i before my reconstruction and i just over 12 months ago. I am sure we all feel anxious so you are not alone. If you are at all worried ask for a CT scan to put your mind at rest. All the best.  Sue xx",

Had aching muscle in my neck and shoulder second day after treatment but only lasted 24 hours. Every chemo you have seems to follow the same pattern. Used to suck boiled sweets for cardboard taste in my mouth and had grapefruit segments every morning which seemed to help. Hope they find primary site soon. My BC was lobular.

The plastic surgeon put an implant into my right breast too at the same time so they matched. The procedure was painful but I chose the LD as it had a quicker recovery time than Diep.

I now feel I am wearing a steel bra and I am in pain 24/7. I thought perhaps my implant had ruptured but a recent MRI scan the BC Consultant has said my MRI results showed nothing that should concern us whatever that means. I am on painkillers which can't be doing me much good. Not sure what to do next but to be honest it has ruined my life as it is so so painful. Someone on the BCC site had the same and was going to have physiotherapy to try and ease the pain. Am due to see the doc on 9th August so I will see what she thinks. I hope she may refer me back to the plastic surgeon who did my reconstruction. We shall see. Just wanted you to know you are not alone.  Sue xxxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Ludo I was diagnosed with lobular cancer which had spread to my lymph nodes in 2008. Had mastectomy plus chemo and radiotherapy. Over the last 10 years I have had breast and back pains and I have always been sent for a bone scan.  As secondaries are often found in the bones I think the first scan to be offered is a bone scan.  I have no idea if a bone scan is more available than an MRI. Perhaps you could ask your BCN. I had a bone scan prior to surgery and another before reconstruction. I have had another two in the last 7 years. All came back clear which was a relief. If a bone scan is offered I would take it and put your mind to rest.  Radiotherapy can have long lasting effects. The oncologists don't really tell you about the effects of the treatment. All the very best Sue xx ",

I was diagnosed with BC in Feb 08 and had a mastectomy and full clearance of lymph nodes as 7 out of 8 had cancer cells. I had both a bone scan and CT scan before the mastectomy and luckily they were both clear. I then had 6 courses of chemo followed by 13 courses of radiotherapy which finished in November. The radiotherapy was every other day for 5 weeks and during the treatment my skin was ok just a bit sore and they give you cream to put on which helps. After the treatment finished the skin got very red like bad sunburn which was painful but it eventually cleared up. I am on Arimidex for 5 years too. I had stiffness in my legs and fingers when I first took it but am not too bad now. Everyone is different of course so you will have to be guided by the oncologist.. If you want any more info let me now. Wishing you all the best. Sue x x x",

I had a mastectomy and clearance of lymph nodes. 9 out of the 11 tested had cancer cells Before my surgery I had a CT and bone scan which is standard practice so don't get too worried about that. I had 6 rounds of chemo and 19 rounds of radiotherapy and had a breast reconstruction after the radiotherapy site had settled down. Next week on the 22nd it will be 11 years since my diagnosis. I was 57 when diagnosed. The treatment wasn't pleasant but doable  I called that time gruelling.  As you say your Mum has been fit until now I am sure she will cope. The NHS are very good in my opinion when dealing with cancer. I have no complaints about my treatment and support. Hopefully the scans will come back clear and she will then get her treatment plan. Would your Mum join the Community perhaps. She would get so much support. Lots of love Sue xxx   ",

I will be having a reconstruction early next year using the muscle and skin from my back. I could have had a recon using the muscle and fat from my tummy but the operation is much longer and recouperation time is longer too. Was told that as I had RT the implant option is not avalable for me as the skin would not stretch over the implant. If all options are available to you stick to your guns and opt for implants only. You can be referred by your GP to any hospital you like and to which surgeon you want to do your reconstruction. Where do you live? I live in Worcester but I am having my surgery in Birmingham because I have seen reconstructions that the plastic surgeon has done and they look wonderful. Best of luck.

Would recommend you invest in a good one as the one I was given by the oncology dept did not work.  Had chemo and felt fine. Had a takeaway curry that evening and went to bed with bowl in case I was sick. Woke the next morning and felt strangely normal. Obviously I did get some side effects over the course of the 6 TAC infusions but I was never sick and put on weight too. The cold cap was not available at my local hospital so I did lose my hair before the second chemo. Had a lovely wig though which I still have. The first chemo is the worse as you don't know what to expect. Not sure which chemo you are having but no doubt your oncologist has been through the likely side effects with you.

Some ladies managed to wear false eyelashes but my eyes were very sore and were always running. The eyelashes hopefully will grow again quickly. All the best Sue  ( diag 22/2/2008) xx",

      "Content": "Hi Mitch I had an LD reconstruction and saline implant  in my mastectomy breast and a silicone implant in my right breast to match. This was done at the same time. My plastic surgeon was a perfectionist. I was very pleased that the breasts matched  All the best I hope you have a good plastic surgeon and you get the uplift and implant to your healthy breast you want. Sue xxx ",
