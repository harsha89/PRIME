After explaining to the oncologist registrar the enormous list of side effects I had on the last cycle ,she discussed with consultant and they have decided to reduce my dose to 75. Has anyone else had this? I was told that it should still be effective in this dose so I hope it is. At the same time I was so relieved as I couldn't bare the thought of another cycle like the last one. Hopefully the side effects will at least be a little easier to cope with, I don't expect them to be gone completely but it will be nice if I can at least function and look after my little one. Hope everyone else is well today. Kelly xx",

Avoid drinking tea with meals as there is something in it that stops you absorbing the iron. I was also told that if you eat or drink something that is high in vitamin c with something high in iron it helps your body to absorb it. Hope this helps a little. Good luck for your chemo :-)",

I have had my 2nd lot of fec today but before I went I found I had got my period I only got my last one 14 days ago. Before I began chemo mine were anything from between 28-35 days. I was told they would be most likely to stop not that I would get more of them grrr lol. I mentioned it to chemo nurse as I thought they may know a little more about it but she seemed puzzled too. So was just wondering has anyone else had this? If so did it stay like that right through chemo or did they eventually stop or at least longer in between? Hope everyone is well. Thanks for reading.",

      "Content": "Hi all My Chemo starts on friday to hopefully shrink my lump. Last friday i was offered to take part in a research trial. However i suffer badly with anxiety (even without cancer) and the side effect list was as long as your arm. These included among other things higher risks of heart problems. This really concerned me as i have a strong family history (grandparent, both parents and 4 siblings) with angina or bad heart problems so i decided against going into the trials and to just have the treatment usually offered. The thing is i have been feeling guilty ever since. I know i have made the right decision for me but i feel like such a bad person for not doing it after all if it wasn't for other people taking risks before i wouldn't be able to have the treatment i am having. Am i a really bad person? I am also starting to feel really anxious again, not so much about treatment but worrying they are too late. I have had quite a few delays in treatment due to having genetic tests and my cancer is grade 3 and around 3cm so just keep thinking it is everywhere and it will be too late to do anything about it. I don't know if it is in the nodes as i wont have biopsy until i have surgery which won't be till at least december. thanks for reading. kelly x  ",

They did another ultrasound to check size and the lump seems bigger I don't know if they seemed worried by this or not as they tend to talk among themselves a bit but I guess they know what they're doing. They mentioned about putting a coil or pin into the lump after I have had my first 3 lots of chemo. Does anyone have any experience of this? How exactly do they do it and is it uncomfortable? Also they have asked if I want to take part in a clinical trial. It would mean another short delay in treatment and risk of more side effects so not sure which way to go on this and obviously don't have long to decide. I would be interested if anyone else has been offered as to wether you did it or not and why if that's not too nosey lol Thanks for reading hoping everyone is having a good day Kelly x",

I know the lump is about 2cm and that i have to have an op and chemo. I went back today for a microbubbles (not sure if this is the right word) test to see if there are cells in the glands under my arm but the bubbles wouldn't go to the right place and the biopsy couldn't be taken. I don't really know what happens next my head is in a bit of a whirl as you can imagine. I didn't think i would be facing this yet as i am only 36. I am more worried for my children who are 16, 13 and just 20 months. I am so worried that i won't be around for them growing up especially my youngest as if something happened to me she wouldn't even remember me. I'm sorry i am being so morbid but i can't really discuss these feelings with my family as they get too upset. It hasn't helped that also on tuesday my dad found out that his lung cancer that has returned is incurable so of course i am also worried for my dad but also it has got me thinking again about my cancer spreading.  Tuesday  i felt really calm but now i am really emotional and just can't seem to stop crying especially when i look at my little one, is this normal? I would really appreciate any tips or advice on how to stay strong and get through this. Thanks for reading kelly",

I think it has really just hit me that there will be no more babies and that I have no choice in the matter. I know I am luckier than some as I already have my lovely kids and I do apologise if I am being insensitive I really don't mean to be. Did anyone else feel like this after chemo. I just always thought I'd have one more and didn't feel quite finished if that makes sense. Thanks for reading Kelly xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi all firstly let me apologise for asking for yet more advice/help,I feel like I take much more than I give on here sometimes. I have been feeling very anxious the last few days. I am convinced that my cancer has just spread everywhere and that the docs are going to tell me they can't do anything. I keep getting aches in my stomach and I have had bleeding piles (tmi so sorry) for quite a while. Also on the back of my neck I kept saying to my hubby (before I knew I had cancer) that there was a bulge it felt like the muscle, well since being on chemo it feels to me like it is smaller. So I have convinced myself all these things are where my cancer has spread. My dad has terminal lung cancer his has spread like that so I don't know if this is why I am feeling this way. I was diagnosed in June with grade 3 triple negative ( i know this is more aggressive)ducal invasive carcinoma (?). As yet I still don't know if its in the nodes and the uncertainty is really starting to get to me. I'm so scared I just can't stop crying. I keep thinking about my children and my husband and what will happen if I'm not here. I have been seeing the oncology counsellor but not sure how helpful it is at the moment. Any advice would be truly appreciated. Thanks in advance Kelly xx",

      "Content": "Hi all. Yesterday, I went to see surgeon to find out the results from lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The good news is that the chemo had done its job and the Tumor had shrunk to 10mm from 11/2 inch. There was a little dcis? But even with that it only measured 15mm. The lump was removed,with clear margins, so no more surgery needed there, which is good. However, one of the two lymph nodes removed had cancer in. I have to have axillary clearance next week. I now feel like I am back to square one, waiting again and still no wiser after 6 months of being diagnosed. I had been feeling really good and positive since surgery but now,the doubts are creeping in again. I can't help thinking about the bump I used to be able to feel on my neck before I had chemo but can't feel now. Or the pains I get in my stomach and bleeding piles ( sorry tmi but I am now thinking it is cancer instead of piles). I also keep worrying about dizzy spells and breathlessness I keep getting. I am convinced again that all the nodes will be positive and there will be tumours everywhere. I keep looking back to before my little one was born over 2 years ago. I remember thinking back then that one of my breasts looked a bit bigger but i didnt think anything of it, i thought everyone had one bigger than the other and it just noticed more becaused i had gained weight. it never occurred to me that it could be cancer. I just keep thinking i already had it back then. My cancer is grade 3,triple negative, so it's aggressive and I just keep thinking if I did have it back then, it must have spread in that time. It isn't helping that my dad has terminal lung cancer that has spread, so I am worrying about him but also his cancer spreading has made me worry even more about mine. I just can't seem to imagine myself ever getting better and have an awful gut feeling that I am in for more bad news. I really want to get back to my happy positive self from the past couple of weeks. People just keep telling me to be positive and enjoy Christmas. I really do want to but I don't know how to shut these thoughts out or deal with them. Sorry this is so long and whiney, I just really need to get this off my chest. I really wish they would do a ct and bone scan but they won't unless there is over a certain amount of nodes affected. This not knowing where I am is really starting to get to me after 6 months. I'm sorry it's all bunched up, for some reason my paragraphs don't work on here.",

I just don't understand why they have to keep me hanging all the time. Sorry I'm just having a really bad day. X",
