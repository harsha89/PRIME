    "Content": "Hi all. Iv been getting lip fillers for years now but ever since I got diagnosed back in December I haven\u2019t been able too and now my lips look like a deflated bloon. I finished my radiation and Capecitabine 6 weeks ago now and I know I\u2019m allowed to dye my hair but am I allowed lip filler?? I don\u2019t want to have a reaction to the Chemotherapy pills or radiation and end up looking like something out of a horror movie.  Samantha xx",
