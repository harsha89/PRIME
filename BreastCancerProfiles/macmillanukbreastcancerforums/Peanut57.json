      "Content": "Thank you for your kind words, think it is all just starting to catch up with me, get one thing out of the way and along comes another. I have had my appt this morning for Oncologist for 14th Dec so feel a little better as gives me some time to get this all cleared up and out of the way and then start the next part of the journey. Thank you again xx",

      "Content": "I feel a tad fed up :( I had my operation on the 3rd October, it went well with clear margins although it was bigger than first thought at 45mm for one of them and think he said 11.5mm on the 2nd one. I was waiting then for oncotype DX test to see if i needed chemo. In meantime my poorly breast got an infection which the Dr's kept chucking antibiotics at, to no avail, My surgeon saw it and decided I needed IV antibiotics so I was admitted on Tuesday, had bloods done yesterday and they have affected my liver and so he put me on new ones but inflammation markers are down so I was allowed to come home on oral ones. The Oncotype came back with fantastic news that I don't need Chemo, but I still feel fed up which is selfish as I think I should be happy as compared so some people I am very lucky. Everything now is again on hold due to the cellulitis in my breast as they cant do any radiation treatment until it has cleared up totally. Seems one thing after another at times when all you want is a little break. Sorry to moan.",

      "Content": "Hi Jan It is the worst part ever the waiting, and I know exactly how you feel. The Oncotype DX was near on 3 weeks before it came back I only got the results last Thursday, but they did say it might be this week, so they got them back a week earlier than they thought they might. Not sure if everyone is different or if it is the normal around 4 weeks ish. Make sure you keep in touch with your BCN as she can keep an eye on the progress of it all. I have clinic again today but the cellulitis I have in my breast is just not getting any better what so ever with the antibiotics, I have been on loads of different ones trying to clear it but it just is not moving, so my Dr I saw yesterday thinks I am most likely to be kept in again today, seems I get over one hurdle and another one gets in my way. Keep your head up Jan, I know how you feel it is sure not easy and a roller coaster of a ride. Once you have your treatment plan in place it will get a little easier as you know where you are then. Thinking of you hun hope you get your results soon. Helen xx",

      "Content": "I am really so scared this wait is going to let my cancer spread. I had a mammogram on the 24th of July, i was recalled on the 15th Aug for a biopsy, I went for the results on the 30th July where I was told I have 2 tumors, and I am stage 2, they didn't think it had gone to my lymph nodes. They are going to do surgery and will take part of the lymph node away. I had my pre opp assessment on the 12th Sept and was told that at the very very earliest it would not be before the 10th October before surgery as the hospital has had to close a theater down due to lack of theater staff and there is a \"back log\". I am now so scared this is going to spread. I have had trouble digesting all this as it is and this is just adding to it all. I just want it taken out of me. Why are we made to wait like this it is soul destroying, this will just have a knock on effect for all my treatment now. I haven't asked what cancer i have as too scared to know, it is something to do with hormones as they told me I would need a hormone pill after RT. Sorry just it is all getting to me and I am feeling deflated.",
