    "Content": "Hi Jane I am 52 and had grade 3 stage 2 cancer diagnosed june 2015. No linf nodes affected. Had chemo first to shrink the tumour then operation in Dec and radiation in January for 15 sessions. Had laprazole for last few months. No diarria but feel pain in my chest and some burning sensation between the chest walls. Not sure the reason but is giving me panic that if cancer is back. I hate this living with cancer and I want this to go away for good and I can be normal. I feel my life stopped at 51 when I was diagnoised, not sure how to deal with day to day life if I am going to feel like this all time. whenever I get a pain I get worried is back. How can I just be normal???!!!Â ",
