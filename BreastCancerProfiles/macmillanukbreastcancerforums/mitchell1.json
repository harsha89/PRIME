      "Content": "Had my year check yesterday. was very disappointed with my consultant, didnt even get a mammogram which shocked me. He had a feel, said he coudn t feel anything to cause concern. But i didn t feel reassured at all. I spoke of all the side effects with anastrozole, insomnia, aching joints, exhaustion and emotion mood swings. His only response was could change tablets but they all have side effects. I then brought up the subject  of reconstruction which he said i could have at an earlier appointment after surgery and now its a no no.. I have been very lucky and still have both breasts but are both totally different. Its knocked my confidence massively. So today after another sleepless night  i am feeling so low, I ve phoned in sick to work which i cant really afford to do. back to feeling lost and unsupported. I cant go on like this for 4 years.I live on my own so do everything myself and just so so exhausted. so if anyone can give me any of their experiences or input to coming off anastrozole and onto something else i would be very grateful. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Heather Think we are very alike, I went into an early menopause in my early forties and was eventually put on HRT to help protect my bones and help with flushes and mood, but soon as the breast cancer appeared was taken straight back off it.Can t help wondering if thats what caused it. I also take calcium and vit D. Have stopped smoking. And also just stick to chicken and fish. As for chocolate. The cravings are certainly a lot stronger than me lol. I feel the same way about better the devil you know with the meds, you fear it getting even worse. Think the insomnia is the worst, thats been a year without a full nights sleep, makes you crazy even worse than i was before all this lol. Didn t really take it what he was saying about reconstruction was trying so hard not to cry. Something about different tissue in the affected one after radio, and other one continuing to droop ( nice) I know there is people a hell of a lot worse than me. But self esteem so low. Can not believe your calls are not being returned. Well actually i do could write a book with things that i think have been out of order. I think its disgusting. I ve always been an independent strong woman and yet now feel so weak now. When is your surgery? what follow up treatment have they said you will need? Its certainly some journey... Take care, and thanks for reply, means a lot...",

My breast is still very tender when consultant had a prod i didn t half wince some nights i can t even lie on that side, are you like that? Sorry to hear about your mum, what have they taken her in for? Well done you for joining all these support groups etc. I m not even that long on here, wish i d joined months ago. But for whatever reason i turned in on myself for a while, strange because im a very social person. So glad i m on now, noone else understands or gets me. They think you should just bounce back to normal. Tbh i thought i would but nobody prewarns you of the meds side affects. take care",

I ve only just joined and so wish i had in the beginning. I had lumpectomy  last sept followed by 15 sessions of radio. Now on anastrozole for 5 yrs. I still dont feel it has sunk in. I was having the year of my life as it was my 50th when i found the lump by chance. At 1st I felt cheated because it was my year but through my journey i realised it wasn t just my year it was \"my life\"... You ll come through it all and believe me life becomes very precious.. Hang in there.... p.s. Dont give work a second thought, make it all about you for a while..",

I also try to stay positive at work although i cracked last week wa under so much pressure (pre cancer i would have just dealt with it. scary thing is when i start i feel i could howl for days, not got time for that. I loved going to my counsellor  but u only get a few weeks, never long enough (i d go everyday if i could lol) but can i just say she was o woman and lovely too. Im on my own too Judith and im kinda glad, enjoying my own space to get my head round all this.. wish we could hire a big hall somewhere and every one could meet and speak face to face about all our fears angers and questions..and of coarse give out lots of hugs.. Hope your counselling goes well and you dont smack him lol, let me know..",

And can honestly say its been an ongoing battle since. Im on anastrozole, worst side effect for me is insomnia. have been given some sleeping pills \"finally\" but only short term. Im constantly exhausted and recently very emotional. The word im going to use is vulnerable and its overwhelming. never felt like this in life before. I truly dont know who i am. outside world just aint getting me. If this is the new me, dont like it.... I so expected to be dancing about by now enjoying the life i ve fought for but not happening. I do feel there is no where to turn. my year check up was a nightmare doc just wasn t interested didnt even get mammogram thats in 3weeks. dreadin that cause breast very tender. I know this all sounds so negative but just off loading.. also i ve developed this pain inside my arm from my elbow up into my armpit bit like toothache pain then gets hot but not to the touch. any thoughts anyone? thanks for reading x",
