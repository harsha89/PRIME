    "Content": "About 4weeks ago I also noticed a hard white bump on the end of my nipple.  I'm 56, had a hysterectomy 26 years ago.  I tried popping it and could not.  It hurt just to squeeze like that. It is not painful to the touch or any other time. I thought it was just a pimple but it will not pop. I try to forget about it since there is no pain but now I'm getting worried.  Is this sometimes a sign of possible cancer?",
