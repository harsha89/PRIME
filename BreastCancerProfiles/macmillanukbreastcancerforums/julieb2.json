    "Content": "hi, i really feel for you - i know each time something like this happens everything you felt or experienced comes flooding back. I'm 42 had 2 mastectomies chemo, radio therapy, medication of different sorts, and been ok for 8 years - yippee i thought then i stated to experience pain in my left arm. i though i had done Â something - you know over stretched or something silly but its all in my arm and shoulder so i have been back wards and forwards to the doc. Ive had steroid injections to ease the pain as the doc though i had a pulled muscle or something like that, two weeks ago i found lumps in the left side of my neck and i have a build up of fluid where my left shoulder blade is........so now I'm back off to hospital on Wed to have a biopsy and tests. Now like you i can help get tearful about it especially over the last few days, and unlike me i don't seem to be able to control it - it just seems so unfair if I'm sick again. i really do feel for you the worry and not knowing - once is a traumatic experience but having to have a bunch of test again.......... please try to keep a little positive but as one of the other ladies said its so hard and everyone wants to tell you its gonna be ok but you, me and the ladies making posts on this website know its not that simple - i so wish it was xxxxxxx",
