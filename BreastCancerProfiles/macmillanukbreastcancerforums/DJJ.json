    "Content": "Good luck. I went through this a couple of years ago when my daughter was just 6. I was open and honest with her, telling her all about Mummy's bad boob and the treatment I was having. she was very accepting of it and even suggested stuffing my bra with tissues In case of sneezing emergencies! I found that she was much more able to deal with my change in appearance if she knew it was going to happen, so much so that she had great fun playing hairdresser and cutting my hair before it fell out! Kids are resilient and matter of fact at that age. My advice is to be honest when they ask questions but don't go into great details, give the basics and they'll deal with it (probably better than you think). Take care and be positive. X",
