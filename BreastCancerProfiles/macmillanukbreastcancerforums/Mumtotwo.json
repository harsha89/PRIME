    "Content": "Hello I am in the same position as you. Â I had my first T last Tuesday and I started feeling rough on Friday/Saturday. I had terrible head aches for 3 days and had aches and pains in my back and legs / feet. I cry a lot when I feel rough and I get down BUT I now feel much better today and feel much happier. I'm even going to go out to the shops to buy my children some summer clothes. So yes, it is only temporary and you will feel better again soon. Mine was 4 days and now I'm feeling good again.",
