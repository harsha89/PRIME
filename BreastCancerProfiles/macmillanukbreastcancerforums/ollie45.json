    "Content": "Hi to you all Its been a while since I last posted.....to be honest after feeling really up and positive before the operation I've been feeling both up and down since. I had my double mastectomy on the 23rd August with my follow up on the 7th September with my consultant. Diagnosis Right Breast all margins clear and all 4 nodes taken  clear....Left Breast all margins clear and out of the 3 nodes only 1 clear. My consultant seemed quiet positive with the results but due to the result has booked me for a further operation on the 4th October to remove a further 9 - 15 nodes. As you all know these meetings are filled with new information & your head is all over the place. These meetings go so quick with no time to think of what you want to ask in response to what you've learnt. I know I can phone and speak to the nurse assigned but personally I find that not as helpful as I should because I never seem to receive a direct answer to my questions. Can anyone help in their experience as to what these results exactly mean. The nurse mentioned chemo 16 - 20 weeks so they must have a clearer picture as to my plan. The waiting again for a further operation and then a further week for results whilst still  going through the pain and discomfort of the double mastectomy is draining me on all levels.   await some inspiration Luv & hugs",
