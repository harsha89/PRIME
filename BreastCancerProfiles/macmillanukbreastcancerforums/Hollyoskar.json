      "Content": "Hi Lynnyk! I was diagnosed a couple of months ago with triple negative lump. Primary tumour thankfully and clear nodes. I also was scared. I had cervical cancer in Austria in 2004 and had a dreadful time & was really worried this would be the same. Well, I 've now just had my second FECT-T and I just want to reassure you that although it's hard, you will get through. My Oncology Care Centre have been fabulous and there's loads of support so don't hesitate to reach out to whoever is there. You've started the process by coming on here and although you'll read some sad words from some very ill people, there is just so much positivity around. Tell your loved ones and friends exactly how you feel, and don't try to be a hero.. It's nice to be Superwoman but now is the time for you, so make use of all the help that is out there - please don't ever feel alone. Don't know if I've helped but I hope so, if even only a little bit. ((Hugs)) xx",

      "Content": "Hi Yvonne. I've been reading a lot about Citralopram recently. I'm only on 10mg a day for anxiety and I'm going to take it until the summer holidays (I work in a school) and then I'm going to taper off the dose. You don't say what dosage you're on, but Citralopram can affect libido. I agree with Barbara that there is a lot more to marriage than sex. Your husband sounds like a lovely, understanding man so please don't beat yourself up about something that you really don't have any control over. Being comfortable with each other is the most important thing right now to help you adjust to your new life post cancer. Be kind to yourself - we all set ourselves such unrealistic targets and then feel like a failure when we can't reach them. It'll happen when it's right for you but don't beat yourself up about it in the meantime, it just adds to your anxiety. Hope you feel better about yourself soon. ((Hugs)) xx",

      "Content": "Hi Emma! I got peripheral neuropathy when on Docetaxal - my toes and the tips of my fingers got pins & needles and then got numb. This is a fairly common side effect. It was worse after my second cycle and my Oncologist reduced the final dose by 20% which really helped. After the third cycle my toes just twitched, I didn't get the numbness. Be sure to mention it to your Oncologist at your next appt. I didn't get any problems with my mouth as I asked for the hospital issue mouthwash that I'd had for FEC and this kept everything at bay. The chemo nurse told me I didn't need it for tax, but I'd read on here that other people had had problems so I'm glad that I insisted. You can buy mouthwash from Boots with the chlorhexidine gluconate in it and it is good too. Hope this helps - take care! Xxx",

      "Content": "The waiting time for results was, for me, the worst part of my whole experience this time around ith Cancer. I was told it would be four weeks between WLE and SNB and results and I couldn't imagine how I was going to get through it. I had sailed through chemo, but this really brought me up short. You're not so mobile at the moment which makes it more difficult. A friend and I made a list of achievable tasks that I could do - just things like cleaning jewellery (didn't take long!), updating address book and birthday book, sorting out family photos, making a physical photo album from my favourite photos from phone/ computer etc. I did a lot of tidying cupboards etc. it didn't really matter what it was as long as it was achievable in a relatively short time. I spent a lot of time messaging friends on Facebook (God, they must have been fed up with my moaning!) Family and friends were a huge help. I also did a lot of walking. It's a three mile round trip to our local garden centre so my husband and I used to walk up there, have a cup of tea and then walk home. The walking was brilliant as it gets your body going and makes you tired to sleep at night. I too played games. I'm not keen on the candy crush type so I did Hay Day and You can spend a lot of time farming! I played solitaire and Free Cell and also did the scrabble type game Words with friends  my iPad was the single most useful gadget during my treatment - I think I'd have gone bonkers without it. When you get the drain out and your exercises get easier and you're more mobile you may find that some of you concentration comes back and you can read again. You don't say how long they told you it would be before you get your results  just keep posting on here and people will come up with suggestions of things they found useful and you'll find your own path. Wishing you well and ((hugs))..xxxx  ",

Last week I took the Citropram every other day and when I saw my GP on Monday he said I could stop it. Now I feel terrible - I can't sleep and I am more and more anxious (Sister has just been diagnosed with oesophageal Cancer which is not helping.

      "Content": "Hi Jamie. I've had 3 FEC which I coped well with, and 2 Tax so far which were harder but do-able. The pain I had was caused by the Filgrastin injections on days 3-7 of the cycle. The first cycle I was okay with paracetamol. The second cycle I had severe pain on one day & decided to phone the hospital if it didn't get better. The next day I had no pain at all! So it's very hard to predict what will happen. I have found that the biggest problem is fatigue which seems to be cumulative. I was still able to go to work for two of the three weeks of FEC, but with tax I'm simply too tired. There is also the infection risk to be considered. I also asked for some of the mouthwash as it helps against oral thrush. My nails have been okay so far (fingers crossed) and I use Body Shop almond oil hand cream. At night time I slap on as much foot and hand cream as I can & I've found that it helps. I'm sorry that I can't give you better advice. Like you, I was terrified of tax and now I'm just looking forward to the last one next Thursday and then it'll all be over. It seems like a terrible mountain to climb when you're facing it but the time does pass. I try a kind of self-hypnosis. & tell myself that I'll feel better tomorrow and generally I do. It's not wrong to feel sorry for yourself every now and again. I think we all do that, but I find it better to look to to future. My husband has booked a couple of days away in the Lake District in three weeks time to celebrate the end of chemo and that gives me something to look forward to. If you do have pain, the hospital should be able to help you. I haven't had to contact my BC nurse but I've always found the Oncology out patient advice line to be incredibly helpful and reassuring. I really do hope that you don't have a bad time on tax as I know that some people do suffer badly. I've just been very lucky so far. Wishing you all the best. Xx",

The surgeon implied that it was because of a shortage of pathologists who deal specifically with breast tissue. I'd be interested in how long other people around the country have had to wait for WLE reports. Thanks for any info. Xxxx",

Again I got an appt with the consultant for four weeks time. I really flipped - I was having problems with anxiety anyway and had been seeing the Clinical Psychologist at the Oncology Health Centre. The surgeon had advised us to complain to PALS  and we did. I then got a letter with an appt with the consultant for the following Thursday, which would have been two weeks after my second WLE. I went to see my GP on the Monday about another matter and he said, let me just check if your report is on the system. He came back with a piece of paper in his hand and he had underlined the words \" no malignancy\". I just sat and cried. The hospital would have been happy to let me stew until the Thursday. I just don't think that they understand the stress involved, and that even a few days can make such a difference. I'll check on that report, thanks! Xxx",

The oncologist recommended Cyclizine half an hour before meals ( 3 times a day) and Lanzoprozole twice a day. The Lanzoprozole reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. That has worked really well for me. I'm now on Docetaxal which is really hard and can make your finger nail go black. Check up on Internet for side effects of the chemo drugs and keep checking this site - it's brilliant for advice & support from people who are going through or have been through the same ordeal as you.. I do know how you feel about the isolation - the first time I had cancer I was living in Austria and I was utterly devastated by how isolated I was ( the after care was shockingly bad) I wish I'd had my iPad & McMillan online community then!
