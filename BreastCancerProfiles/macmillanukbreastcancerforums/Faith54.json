      "Content": "Dear All, My Mum (61 years old) was diagnosed with TNBC late July last year.  She finished 6 rounds of chemo at the beginning of Dec and is currently waiting for her mastectomy.   She cannot have radiation due to having it already on her chest - she had chemoradiation for cancer of the gullet in Jan 2014.  There is also a family history - two of my Mum's sisters passed away from BC in the 1980's when they were in their thirties, just 18 months apart, it's truly bloody awful and you couldn't make it up!  My Mum has however tested negative for the BRACA genes.  So the previous radiotherapy may of caused the BC or it could be just a freak coincidence?! So this leads me to my question - My Mum did originally want a double mastectomy but the surgeon I feel talked her out of it saying that if the cancer was to return then it would more than likely go elsewhere, rather than the remaining healthy breast so Mum settled on a single mastectomy, however after discussing it with myself and female family members (we said we would all opt for the double) she has changed her mind, although she's still not sure. What is worrying her (and me) is that the single mastectomy was booked for 7 weeks after her chemo finished (we were originally told they like to do it 4-6 weeks after) and if she opts for the double it'll be 4 days later (so 7 weeks and 4 days since chemo finished). Four days shouldn't matter that much in the scheme of things should it?  We are just all really anxious that Mum is having to wait this long but apparently that's the earliest it can be done. They are doing a complete mastectomy on diseased breast (cannot re-construct) & removal of lymph nodes.  From the scan mri etc it looked like one node was involved but the surgeon said the other day they couldn't be sure of the no involved until they operate.  She did say that the lymph node has had a really good response to the chemo (you can no longer feel it) & the breast feels like a thickening compaired to what it was before but the mri scan showed that the original size of the tumour (or the blueprint of the tumour) was still the same.  But the surgeon explained that it might not all be tumour, could be scar tissue etc. So I know my Mum doesn't really know what to do for the best - whether to have one or both breasts removed.  She says she is only really concerned in case having both off will mean a longer recovery time.  She thinks if it's going to come back it will whether she has them both off or not. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance and sorry for the essay! H x",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies, My Mum was diagnosed with grade 3 TN back in Jul, with 2 lymph nodes involved.  She had 6 cycles of chemo, followed by a double mastectomy a few weeks ago.  We're currently waiting to hear if she can have radiotherapy but we've been told this is highly unlikely due to previous radiotherapy in the chest area (for a previous cancer). I'm just concerned that they didn't remove all of Mum's nodes (we were under the impression that they would of) but the surgeon told us that she removed 7 in total.  Upon diagnosis my Mum had a large tumour and most of her breast had DCIS.  They said that the tumour had gone after the chemo (but the DCIS was still there) and they couldn't feel the lymph node either upon examination but once they'd removed the lymph nodes there was still traces of cancer in two of them. So I'm just really worried now that they didn't remove enough nodes?  When I asked her why they didn't she said that they like to leave nodes behind for the draining of fluid in the arm etc.  It's such a worry especially as it looks like Mum won't be able to have radiotherapy.  Just wondered if it was unusual that they haven't removed all the nodes? My Mum chose to have a double mastectomy as she lost her two sisters to BC.....although she doesn't carry a faulty gene. Thanks in advance ",
