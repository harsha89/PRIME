      "Content": "I had the same surgery you had but without the chemotherapy before.  I think what you are feeling is very normal.  At 4 weeks I was still sore and very weak.  I could hardly walk to the mailbox without breathing heavily. My family packed me up and took me to the beach and I couldn't even carry a beach chair or bag.  I was feeling really good after 6 weeks and doing physical therapy exercises on my own.  I can't sleep on my sides yet. The expanders are still uncomfortable but everything else has healed nicely.  I'm out walking regularly again but not lifting weights yet. I'm looking forward to getting the permanent implants.   Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "My worst pain was when the expanders would jab into my scar tissue under my breast.  I would walk around holding the expander up just to take the pressure off.  And sleeping was hard too!  I had lots of pillows around me to hold things up and in place.   I'm 9 weeks post op now and feeling good.  I would have probably already had the implants put in but I had to have an additional surgery at 7 weeks post op.  I had to have skin removed on the left side near my underarm because the pathology report showed that a small amount of cancer was lying on and attached to the skin.  The doctors decided it was better to remove it than have 6 weeks of radiation because they knew exactly where the spot was.  When removing the tissue in the first surgery, it was the only spot the doctor had trouble removing.  He scraped so hard to remove the tissue that he cut through my skin and then stitched it up.  It was good that he did because there was no question of where to go back in.  I just had the stitches out today and will be scheduled for final implants in a few weeks. It's such a long process and hard to be patient.  I have had wonderful doctors and feel so thankful that the cancer is out!  I'm pleased too with how everything is healing and the appearance.",
