Not all breast cancer appears as a lump and there are several on here that have said they have had some pain. I know I did. Hope that doesn't worry you - just think that you should go and see your GP. Then he/she can hopefully rule cancer out. Gay xxx",

There was only 11 days between dx and op, so didn't even think about it/ or know it was an option.  My cancer also did not show up on mammogram. US wasn't that great either, was told it looked like my nodes were clear, turns out 14 out of 18 contained cancer.  My only check up now is yearly mammo (actually just had my 2 year one today). I do wonder if there is much point, but I guess yes just in case something does show up.  For me, I did notice changes in my infected boob for 2 year prior to dx that drs dismissed so I think I have an idea what to look out for.  Also when I had my mri, I don't think they used a contrast dye. They definitely did for the ct scan, but not the mri.  Peace of mind is everything. Cwtches, Gay xxx",

Unfortunately the 2 week wait for an urgent referral is not always met, and it can depend very much on whereabouts you live. I had to wait nearly 6 weeks for an urgent referral before I had my appointment at the breast clinic, despite my gp writing, 'I highly suspect this is bc.'  It is unfortunate that your appt was cancelled. Did they just cancel it and leave it, surely it would have made sense at the very least to make another appointment at the same time? I would give the gp and/or the hospital a ring on Monday to find out what is going on. Waiting is the absolute pits, whether for an appointment or for results. Hope you can get this sorted asap!

      "Content": "Hiya lovely, I am not sure if you are scared of the scans or or the results, or maybe both. So let me say in terms of the scans first. I have had a ct, bone and mri (of the breasts). I have to say the mri scan was the most I was scared of. I absolutely hate being in confined spaces. But I let the technicians for the mri know this and they said I could stop at any time. They also said that my other half could be there if I wanted to hold my hand  - I said no, because I thought I would be calmer without him!!! (I didn't tell him this - he likes to think he is doing his best to support me -Ha, ha) One main thing though, it is very very noisy. Like you are in a washing machine doing full cycle and then the tumble drying! In terms of the results, I do understand how scary this is. Just think that as soon as or if they find something, they can offer treatment for it. It would be much worse if something was going on and wasn't detected. I know that sounds scary, I am in the same boat with you. Gay xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Butterflybaby, Welcome to the online forum. I was diagnosed with ILC last November and am now just about coming to the end of treatment. Mx with immediate recon, node clearance, chemo and radio. Just finished radiotherapy last week, although apparently you still cook for a couple of weeks after!! The time has gone so quick. I can't believe it! It has been nowhere near as bad as I expected it to be. My worry now is going back to work - I think I may have forgotten how to do it! The cold cap isn't all that bad, just uncomfortable and you look very silly! I used to take a couple of paracetamol half an hour before putting it on. I would take a cardie or jacket you can put over your shoulders if needed because I used to find that all of me felt cold. Take in some nice nibbles as a treat part way through. And using the cold cap will slightly extend the session so make sure you have things to keep you occupied eg kindle, tablet, book, magazine. Maybe take a cap/hat to wear leaving the hospital. You will have your hair plastered in conditioner and a few icicles too - not the best look! Best wishes for Tuesday, Gay xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Butterflybaby, Overall I think I coped pretty well with chemo. With FEC (EC + another drug) I think the main side effect is usually nausea. I wore anti nausea travel bands from Boots ( I remembered that they took away my morning sickness when I was pregnant). I don't know if they helped, but I didn't suffer from nausea at all.  There are plenty of anti sickness meds if you do suffer from nausea. The steroids they give you for a couple of days after do keep you awake though.  Week 2 is when your white blood cells are a their lowest. Week 3  - completely back to normal. I would think that week 3 would be the best week to go away.  I then had the 3 weekly docetaxel which did cause more aches, days 3-8 so I had lots of painkillers at the ready.  The cold cap worked ok...I will say that I lost about half my hair, had some very dodgy bald patches but then longer hair that I could comb over. I have had my hair cut quite short now because it was all different lengths and in not great condition. But overall I would choose to wear it again if I needed to.  Try not to worry too much about Tuesday.  Gay xxx",

On the positive side the statistics are in your favour so hopefully your stay on here might not be long.  Yes, it is well known on here that Dr Google is evil and if approached, must be handled with care. As well as the macmillan sites, cancer research and breast cancer care are also reputable sites that you could look at if you want to, but you might be jumping the gun at this stage.  I would say carry on your normal life as much as possible. Try to imagine a box at the back of your mind where you can store your worries away. Some people have said that they give themselves eg 30 mins a day to think about it and then they put it in the box. I also found going to work helped. Some of my close colleagues that I told, said what on earth are you coming into work for - but I had to, it kept my mind occupied. Try to get on with mundane things that will keep you occupied. Sort out summer/winter clothes, spring clean, change the beds, go to the cinema, go for a walk (but wrap up warm!). Remember worrying about it will not change the results - so there is no point worrying. My OH also didn't want to talk about it. I bent the ear of my sister in law who is a nurse and is very calming. Is there anyone else you could talk to? I didn't tell my mum or my children till I got my dx. If there isn't anybody, then come on here (there are other sites too) and cry, rant and get your worries out - regardless of the fact you haven't got a dx yet. Cwtches, Gay xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, Just wanted to wish you all the best for tomorrow. I had my first day back in school on Friday after being absent since last November. I did not actually teach any classes I had a day to catch up, find out where my classes were etc. I have two days this week and I will have classes. I am excited but do feel a little bit sick to my stomach when I think about it. I think it will be like riding a bike - once you get there it will all come flooding back, and it will feel like you have not been away!! The staff and pupils I saw on Friday were wonderful and I had loads of hugs. But I really understand how you are feeling. As Jo says, it did feel good to be back. Just getting up and putting on a teacher outfit (smart trousers and blouse , smart shoes etc) rather than slobby jeans and a t-shirt made me feel good, like the teacher me was still there. Are you not classified as still being employed whilst being on sick leave? Even though I have been off, I am still employed by the council so I would not think to put down any gaps on my CV (if I updated mine). The only snag would be if there was a section asking about how many days off sick in the past year. In my opinion to begin with I would not include it in the covering letter. I would just try to sell myself as much as possible and hope to get interviews. The only thing then is what would you say at the interview - why not speak to the workplace advisors on the helpline for advice on what you should declare and the best way to go about it?   Just take it nice and slow tomorrow, it will all come back and as already said, enjoy it!

It is not that painful, really just a persistent little ache but it is not that bad. I am aware of it but it is not too painful at all. I have been taking co codamol but it is only because I was given a big supply, and to be honest I am sure that I could cope without them. I am just a big wuss. I have been advised not to lift anything at all but sometimes I forget because it is my right hand side! Lifting doesn't hurt but I am worried about the risk of lympadema as I have no nodes left at all. I can easily move arm, but there are sets of exercises that you will be given to do, and I find it difficult to lift my arm out to the side. It doesn't hurt but I can feel it stretching. After 2 and a half weeks I did drive a very short journey but I live in a small village, I don't fancy driving around in a bigger place just in case. I do have to take my time getting dressed and I needed help to wash my hair. Clothes irritate the top of my arm and I can't sleep on my right hand side. Also not sure if it is just me but I look like I am developing a bingo wing!!! Can't help about how blue you will go though! xxx",

You are right the wait is really shit and especially if you have been off for half term. When I was waiting for my dx, I was glad that I had work to go to, and my school was preparing for an inspection (I am a teacher too) - kept my mind occupied. My dx was on the day the inspectors arrived, the lengths some people will go to to avoid a lesson observation!!!  I went off the day before surgery.  Well statistically the odds are on your side so fingers crossed that this will only be a fleeting visit for you. However if it is bc, then there is a very high survival rate and we are all here to hold your hand through any treatment - I know only virtually, but it still counts.  Try not to overthink things and tell yourself that worrying about it, will not change the results.  Cwtches - keep busy till Wednesday, Gay xxx",

I did my teaching practice in a school in Kendal. With chemo. the day or so before you need to go and have your bloods tested and have appointment with onc. Then there is the chemo session itself and then the day after, you have an injection - I had to wait in for the district nurse to give mine. The second week after chemo is when your white blood cells are the lowest - I wouldn't go anywhere near school that week! I think that for teachers, it is generally recommended that they don't work through chemo.  I was devastated at first, really upset for my exam classes. But they got by fine without me! Damn thought I was indispensable - (only joking.) One of the other teachers at the school had bc in her early thirties. She was a font of knowledge through treatment. However you have us now on this forum so anything you need to know, fire away! Cwtches, Gay xxx",

But I had fairly small boobs and a relatively big tumour so I think that a mastectomy was always on the cards for me. Also lobular cancer (I had that too) seems to be a lot more sneakier than ductal cancer because of the way the tumour grows. Mine ended up being bigger than what I was told.

I was referred by my GP and first saw a consultant about my breasts in the hospital in 2014. I had constant pain in my breasts, taking 4x2 lots of over the counter ibuprofen a day. This lasted for months. I could not feel a definite lump - I just thought that the whole thing felt lumpy anyway. I think this is why I was surprised this year when the doctor this year said I had a definite lump. It has always felt lumpy!!! My right breast has also felt different to the left for years. In 2014 the consultant completely reassured me and I felt like a bit of a fraud, taking up his time. He recommended oil of evening primrose. I think because of his reassurance I was not that vigilant about checking my breasts. Roll on 2 years, large lump and extensive spread to lymph, fingers crossed it hasn't spread any further. I have looked on some forums and people have commented that their cancers could have been growing for 1-2 years. I keep thinking now was this the start. I keep telling myself, even if it was the start, it is not going to make any difference now. Just cross, cross cross, mainly with myself.

I did mention this to my onc and he halved the dose of the steroids for the remaining sessions of fec. This worked fine and for the remaining fec sessions I was ok. It all changed on T. On T you have steroids before and after chemo. I did not get that 'sleeplessness' on T. Maybe because I was so completely knackered by that stage... :D Gay xxx",

      "Content": "Hi JustLittleMe, Just wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions? I teach too and although I might go in for a couple of weeks before the summer to sort things out (like put my room back to normal!), I am not thinking of going back properly until September - which is when I am thinking of a phased return. (I still have 4 weeks of radiotherapy to go through). I was just thinking that 3 weeks of reduced hours is not very long. Do you mind if I ask if you were ok with this or if you had any other options? Of course with teaching it is not just the hours in school, it is all the hours of marking and preparation that is done at home. I am worried that even if I make it through a full day when I return, I will not cope with the possible extra 2-3 hours a night! Also when I last went into school, my head of department mentioned the timetable allocation for next year. Basically she was saying that timetable-wise, it would be easier to allocate me a reduced number of lessons for the whole year with the implication being a reduced timetable would be reduced pay for the year!  One suggestion was possibly dropping to 0.7 allocation. Now I am really going to struggle when I go down to half pay in a couple of weeks, I don't need the added worry about not coping financially for another whole year. She wasn't being funny, she is lovely and very supportive but she wasn't sure how it works either. Just wondering about your experience. Gay xxx",

Asda and tesco had a good selection. Asda also do lots of post surgery bras on line - they are not always in the shops. I just bought my normal size. I found it useful to wear a strappy top under a shirt. This was easy to peel down whenever I had appointments. Gay xxx",

Mine too was more like a thickening of an area, not a definite hard lump. When I felt around for it, in some positions I could feel it and then in some positions I could not. Does one breast feel different from the other? Anyway definitely get yourself to the GP. Most appointments are only for 10 minutes so don't even worry about wasting someone's time.

Then I went on a breast cancer care course and they said that there was not enough evidence to suggest that soya containing foods were a problem. I have not cut soya out of my diet but I have instead have tried to have more quorn instead of soya. So when I have made spag bol, instead of using soya mince, I have used quorn instead. I still eat soya containing products but maybe not as often as I would have.  I also bought flaxseeds when I was first given my dx. Again I think the evidence is limited. Personally I think a little is ok .  As tox says, worrying about it is not good. Carry on trying to have a balanced, healthy diet.  Cwtches, Gay xxx",

Because of this you are likely to be offered hormone treatment to reduce the amount of oestrogen in your body. It might be tamoxifen or it could be an aromatase inhibitor such as letrozole.  Because of your age I would assume you are pre- menopause. This might means you are offered zoladex injections to stop your ovaries from making more oestrogen or that might even suggest ovary removal.  Cwtches, Gay xxx",

It didn't feel any different to me as it had felt heavier for the past two years but the GP felt a lump. I mainly had lobular cancer which is known to be a sneaky bugger and does not usually show up on a mammogram nor does it always present as a lump. I was surprised by this too.  Gay xxx",

No please tell your mum not to worry- It hasn't been as bad as I was expecting having read all the horror stories. Not as easy as FEC was, but FEC was very kind to me.  My advice would be to pre dose on painkillers eg ibuprofen and codeine (check to make sure these are ok for her) after day 2. The aches for me left me feeling tender all over so a few days spent on settee. After T 4, I felt very sorry for myself and did lie down a lot. After T 5, I made an effort to be more active - a little walk everyday, and it did help. The feeling in my mouth was horrid - ice lollies and yogurts helped me. Both of these started about day 2/3 and lasted till day 8/9.   Just tell your mum to take it easy. If she does have any unpleasant side effects make sure she rings up and gets something to help for them. But it will be ok, and just keep thinking the end will be in sight. Take care, Gay xxx",

Firstly one thing I have learnt from when I was first diagnosed is that everyone is so different - so it is difficult to comment on the points you have made. I do know that in my case my cancer did not show on the mammogram and the US was inconclusive - the dr couldn't be sure one way or another. I had presumed that all cancers would show on a mammogram - this is not always the case. After surgery I have an area of scar tissue - again US of this was inconclusive. So it is not always the case that they can give you definite answers after mammograms/US. It does seem that they are being very thorough - which is a good thing (in my opinion).  A couple more things I need to mention to you. Firstly, think that worrying will not change the results. So try to keep yourself occupied and try not to worry - and yes, I have been there myself so I do know how hard this is. Secondly if it is bc, then it is very treatable and we will be here to hold your virtual hand. If you have anymore questions or if you just want to cry or rant, please feel free on here.

I used tubigrip supplied by the hospital and the district nurse to go over the dressing. It does come in different sizes so doesn't need to be tight. Fortunately I had mine over the cold months so long sleeves covered it. Once when I was going out I did cut up a pair of patterned tights to wear over it - maybe you could try this at night time? You could even try cutting the foot of a sock off.  There are also picc line covers available on ebay or just type into google. Gay xxx",

This is just an old case of people not understanding or empathizing what it is like. It is unfortunate but generally people cannot even imagine what it is like (not even close) until they walk in the same shoes themselves. Not that anybody would wish this experience on anybody else.  It is always the case when you look ok on the outside - people are not aware of what is going on in the inside. I'm sure your friend did not mean any ill will, she does not understand. I get the same now I am back at work, everyone thinks I am back to normal (what's that???), but I am not. They don't see me collapsing on the settee at night. Even my close family see me back at work and think that I am ok. Well, I am not and I can't see I ever will be, but I will keep on plodding on, trying to do the best I can. Cwtches, Gay xxx",

I don't remember how long pain lasted. I am such a wuss, I kept the painkillers topped up. I heard it was easier to keep on top of the pain, rather than wait for it to appear and then take tablets. I would think you would be ok to take painkillers up to the weekend, but if in doubt check with your bcn.  I had full clearance when I had my mx last November. The numbness has got less and less as time gets on, but I still do have some slight numbness under my armpit at side of boob, and underneath the top of my arm. It is hardly noticeable (I just had a quick feel now to double check lol), but it is there and I am presuming I will always have some slight numbness.  keep on doing your exercises to help too.

So back for a biopsy which the Dr did very carefully!!  All the waiting time in between was awful. But better to get it checked out. It is still there now. You can't see it.

      "Content": "Hi, I had a skin sparing mx with recon last November. In terms of bras, you need post surgery bras or sports bras. A front fastening bra (or 2) is a really good idea. I didn't have any, and I remember once getting trapped half in half out of a sports bra with a racer type back. (had to call other half for help). I personally prefer sports bras because they seem to fit better and mould to your shape. Post surgery bras don't  seem to fit my implant that well - that could just be me!! To begin with I just got a few sports bras from Asda, fairly cheap and did what they needed to do! You don't need any cream whatsoever for your wound. You need to keep it completely dry until the scar has heeled completely. It will take a few weeks.  Do take moisturiser for your skin. I had to get some brought in to massage my skin from advice from the lymphoedema nurse.(if you are having a full node clearance).  Trying to rack my brain to think of anything else to take in. I would suggest buying some dry shampoo, not necessarily to take to hospital but to have at home because I couldn't wash my hair properly for 2/3 weeks. Mind you, I ended up buying several cans, which are sat on a shelf now because I don't need them at the moment...... I was told to keep on top of the pain killers. I was given ibuprofen and co codamol.  I took them for about a week and had no issues with pain what so ever (did have constipation from the cocodamol, sorry if tmi).  Are you having a anc? I did. For 2/3 weeks I couldn't lift my arm above shoulder level. I could drive after 2/3 weeks, but mine was the right side, so I don't know about changing gears?  The main issue after surgery will be the drains that you have to carry around with you for about a week and have emptied. I was maybe a little bit tired, not much. I think how much you can lift depends on whether you are having an anc.  Have to go now, hope you found some of this useful. Take care, Gay xxx",

Yesterday the GP surgery told me that I have to nominate a pharmacist to collect my prescription, I can't collect it from the surgery anymore, apparently health board rules. I protested saying I don't always go to the same chemist.

Instead I  have come home tonight to open an appointment with the consultant. Hmmm, things feel ok to me, but can't stop wondering if things are ok, then why have I been sent an appointment with the surgeon??? Just wondering how everyone else got their results? Sensible head is saying everything is ok, crazy head is saying what IF?, why send a consultant appointment if it is not necessary?? Think I will ring the consultant's secretary tomorrow to see if I can find out any more. Just wondering about everyone else's experiences?  Cwtches, Gay xxx",

I had mastectomy last Wednesday after noticing skin puckering on my breast on 2nd Oct. The doctor then pointed out to me where the lump was. I felt so stupid. How on earth did I not notice before? I got positive diagnosis on 10th November. As you say it happens so fast. It also has spread to my lymph nodes so had all them removed during the op. I don't know the grade or type yet, results should be on Monday. It is good to have these forums to know that others are going through/gone through what is happening to us now. My plan is just to take it one day at a time and maybe watch some naff christmas movies for the next month! Take care x",

I know what you mean about your worries - I am 44 and my children are teenagers but I still have had those thoughts too. When you had surgery, the nasty b*stard cancer cells were taken out. Chemo and radio will mop up any strays. Focus on being positive - try to put your worries to the back of your mind. Take it one day at a time, or even an hour at a time.  If you need to come on here and cry/rant/rage/ talk about crap, then do. There will always be someone here.

I was given a shower cover (a limbo) because you cannot get it wet - a bit of a nuisance at times but I still would rather have had it than not.  I am not quite sure how I would have felt to have a picc line in the summer, but in the winter months it is covered up and no-one will know.

My sister, age 50, passed away in March (not cancer related) and I am really worried about how my mum will take all of this, especially as I am so far away. Since March we have become closer, in contact everyday. I think I will use Skype so she can see me, but I am not sure how to announce it. I don't want to sound blase but nor do I want to worry her. I had biopsy on 10th Nov, news on 14th and Mx on the 23rd. I haven't told her any of this because she has just been away on a big holiday which after everything that happened with my sister, I think she needed. She knows that I had a lump and that I had a mammogram at end of October. However I had a mammogram a couple of years ago because I had constant pain in my breasts and I had the all clear then. I told her that I had a routine recall because I had a mammogram before. Just before she went away, she asked if I had heard anything and I told her no. She is blissfully unaware at the moment. She is flying in today and has texted me that she will ring tomorrow. Don't want to tell her any more fibs! ",

Since I started taking letrozole last July, I have made a conscious effort to stick to one brand, accord. Sometimes this means that I have to go to several different chemists to get my prescription. I found the side effects quite bad to start of with, achy fingers, achy bones - especially first thing in the morning, I describe it as the robot (the movements I made getting up and walking down the stairs!) I found that taking a joint supplement really helped. I took seven seas glucasamine + omega 3 tablets, quite pricey but were worth it. Available in all supermarkets, but also in some bargain stores, like home bargains. Now several months later I have stopped taking supplements. Not actually by choice initially, I ran out and kept forgetting to get more in! I thought at first I would not be able to cope, but everything is ok. I still have achy fingers but not that bad, I am just aware of it as a mild ache. I take my tablets at night before I go to bed, I would suggest you try sticking to one brand for a few months.

Quick easy op with minimal recovery time.Only a couple of days after with strong painkillers. I had 4 small incisions, one in my belly button, 2 each side where ovaries are and one just above pubic hair line. They are so small that no one would notice them unless I pointed them out. I was on zoladex for about 6 months beforehand. Immediately after the op, I did have more hot flushes than before but they soon subsided.  Cwtches,  Gay xxx",

I am sure your mum if she was aware of what was happening would want the best for you too. You cannot please everybody. I think that this is a selfless action, the complete opposite of being selfish.  What is the problem with her brother and sisters? Are any of them wanting to take her into their homes? Even if they said yes, the views of her children are more important  - in my opinion.  It is difficult for me to comment on this because as a member of the bc group, I have had bc myself, not that I have cared for somebody. Although my mum has had bowel cancer, she is ( fingers crossed) doing ok - awaiting scan results. Maybe if you posted in the carers group, you might find more people that have been in a similar position? Sending you lots of cwtches, do what you think is best for your mum. Gay xxx",

Both times I was petrified, not just because of what the op entailed but the thought of being put to sleep. My main advice here is to make sure the staff know how you are feeling (if you are worried about the op) I was quietly sobbing in a tissue as I walked down into the op theatre with the nurse. All the staff were kind, patient and calming. They did not rush me. I had an injection of something - don't know what - because I was upset and anxious. Anyway it obviously worked I don't even remember going to sleep! I don't remember having this injection when I had my mx. But I would recommend it! Cwtches, Gay xxx",

Like you feel very tender, as though you are covered in invisible bruises - that's why they say hit by the tax truck! It is a very weird feeling. Easily managed by taking painkillers. Ibuprofen and paracetamol taken alternatively over 2 hours, obviously keeping within the daily limit. I did have some cocodamol left over from surgery so I had that for the first one. With fec, I was fine, with T, I had a couple of days each cycle on the settee. Effects lasted from about day 2 to 10. The day after chemo, I was fine - I thought what's all the fuss about..... I put weight on during fec as I did a lot of comfort eating. With T the taste in my mouth was so foul. I actually started to lose weight on T.  The good news is that by the first time you notice the effects of the first T, you will be able to say to yourself that you have nearly finished chemo, the end will be in sight.  Gay xxx",

Nausea - drs can prescribe tablets for this, try emend. I found travel sickness wrist bands from boots helpful. Funny mouth and taste - again there is a mouthwash that can be prescribed.

A couple I could hardly feel, one hurt A LOT and the other two were ok. I always find that the male nurse is more gentle! I had heard somewhere about anaesthetic cream being applied to the tummy before the injection. When I went for my first injection, I mentioned it to the nurse and he said that it could be prescribed but one had not been prescribed for that session as it was my first one. I said I would see how it went. As this first one was ok, I said I wouldn't bother with any anaesthetic in future. So it can be ordered. Why don't you ring up the onc unit and ask for anaesthetic to be prescribed for when you have the next injection? I wouldn't leave it until you went in, because it might need to be prescribed.  Gay xxx",

Did they confirm the diagnosis on the phone? I think that is unusual - it is normally done in person. I am guessing you have an appointment now to discuss treatment options? It is a bit pants at first because there is quite a bit of waiting for results, appointments, etc. But bc is very treatable and there are lots of us on her to answer any questions you may have.

      "Content": "Hi Violet blue, I had a skin sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using an implant in November. I only had 9 days between diagnosis and op so if I am perfectly honest I was shell shocked at the time and went along with what my consultant recommended. I remember the breast care nurse showing me photos. I did consider if I could cope without a breast and I was not totally against the idea. I think that because of my age (43) and the fact that I was a fairly small size (34A/B) the consultant considered an implant was the way to go. And now? Well I have to say that overall I am pleased with the outcome. My boobies are not perfect, but then they were not perfect before!!! I like the fact that I can wear a bra/bikini/swimming cossie and no-one would have any idea. There are lots of pretty post surgery bras around so you can still feel feminine. Without the bra, well I am a bit lopsided , my implant sits a bit higher up than my natural breast.  The scar on my breast is healing up nicely, it goes across from the side and around my nipple. I was not sure if I would still have my nipple - never been so pleased to see a nipple when they took the dressings off!!! If I had a choice, I would definitely have an implant again.  Take care, Gay xxx",

I did not lose much hair at all on docetaxel - I have never heard anyone mention that it doesn't work all that well with it. (It was my eyebrows and eyelashes that went on T).  I did notice it becoming more painful as it went on as my hair got thinner and thinner. However for T, it does not need to stay on as long. I took both paracetamol and ibuprofen before the last two sessions - and this helped a lot. I did end up losing quite a bit of hair, but I would use it again, so I consider it a success. Gay xxx",

I only had 9 days between dx and surgery so it was a bit of a whirlwind! I do wonder if it was because I was a size 10 that there would not be enough fat there - but I am only guessing. (There would probably be enough fat there now!!!) Anyway just to say that overall I am quite pleased with my implant. It is a nice shape and certainly in my bra/bikini, no one would ever know. I went on to have radiotherapy and have had no problems. I have a tiny area of hard scar tissue but I think that this could happen after any surgery. I am not aware that I will need anymore surgery in the future.  Good luck making your decision, Gay xxx",

You are protected, ''  In England, Scotland and Wales, employees with cancer are protected from discrimination in the workplace by the Equality Act 2010. '' This is anybody with cancer or who has had cancer. You cannot be discriminated or treated unfairly just because you had cancer. There is a Macmillan booklet but I don't know how to tag it.  If you are signed off till August, then I would say you don't necessarily have to be in touch till the end of July when you could go in to discuss your return to work and how they could support you then eg by a phased return. If you have a good relationship you could get in touch, but you don't have to.  The most important thing here is don't worry about work. You have enough on your plate. Just concentrate on taking a bit of time to get yourself better.  The Macmillan helplne will have further info and may be able to reassure you some more. Gay xxx",

If you are not having the cold cap, then I don't think it will take that long at all. For my first one I took a big bag with book, magazine, tablet, water, snacks etc and hardly touched any of it!

I lost at least 50% of my hair overall. Two weeks now after last chemo and it has started to grow back slowly. I too went very, very thin on top of my head and on my neck, mainly on one side! I think it was on my 4th chemo session, I noticed the difference with my very thin hair and how cold I felt. I was ready to not to it again. Like you said, I couldn't get warm all night. I went to bed with my socks on and a beanie hat that night! My teeth were chattering! Before the 5th and 6th session I took both paracetamol and ibuprofen and I coped much better. I also made sure I took more layers with me in my bag to put round me in case I needed them.  My hair to be honest looks pretty awful at the moment, but I am glad that I used the cold cap. I wear headbands and scarves to disguise the thin bits. I am pretty sure that with the scarves, it is not obvious to people who don't know me. I am not comfortable going out without the head scarves at the moment but I will get there! Gay xxx",

You can get mouthwash on prescription too.  My question is so I am 12 days after final chemo, did anybody notice any side effects after this time.

The only thing that has affected me is not being able to sleep when on the steroids the couple of days around treatment, so this had knocked my sleeping pattern out. I am pretty sure that I could have coped with going into work, but as I teach I thought it best to stay away from any possible sources of infection. But I have managed to design some work booklets at home and I have also tried to do more exercises. The vast majority of days on chemo I have felt my normal self, achy after T but painkillers help. I had 3 fec, then 3 T, 3 weeks between each one.  I also used the cold cap with some success. I have lost a lot of hair probably about 50% but I am still glad I used it. When you are about to lose hair, the general feeling is like you have had your hair in a tight pony tail all day - it wasn't what I would describe as pain. I am hoping no more hair is going to go, I had last chemo on Tues. Of course everyone is different. Don't read too many horror stories. It has been nowhere even near as bad as I was expecting it to be. Gay xxx",

The cold cap does not necessarily cause headaches, it is just bloody, bloody cold - paracetamol can take the edge off the coldness. I was ok to begin with without taking any paracetamol, but on my 4th chemo, the coldcap was so painful because by then my hair had thinned quite a bit. I managed the 5th and 6th chemo with paracetamol and high strength ibuprofen taken half an hour before the start of the chemo.  D you suffer from headaches regularly?

      "Content": "Hi Scaredgirl34. I had zoladex injections for about 7-8 months before I had my ovaries removed. My bc was highly er+ and I had a high number of lymph node involvement so my onc didn't want any oestrogen knocking around. As I am 45, I was premenopause, so therefore my ovaries would still have been producing oestrogen. The zoladex puts a stop to the ovaries making oestrogen. It is a preventative measure. It is not the nicest of injections as the needle is quite big, so it is best not to look. I found that it really depends on the nurses giving the injection, some nurses, I couldn't feel a thing. But there were a couple of nurses, where it hurt quite a bit. Didn't put me off though, as I knew it was necessary to stop this shitty disease from coming back. I have now had my ovaries removed so I do not need any more injections. Cwtches, Gay xxx",

I actually can't help you much with your question but did want to welcome you on board. Could you try ringing your bcn or gp tomorrow morning?  I am assuming that the dressings are fixed down and you have not removed them at all ? I think some itching and tightness is normal after an op. The tightness will go with time. Could you try antihistamines to stop the itching?  Or just thinking a little more now..you describe the itching as intense. Is there any chance you could be allergic to the dressing they have used? I had a dressing over my picc line for chemo which made me itch. Again your best bet is the bcn in the morning.  Gay xxx",

I had chemo and radiotherapy after surgery - no changes to the implant. I have got a tiny little lump next to my implant which is scar tissue but I think this can happen after any op.  In a bra/bikini no-one can tell the difference.

If only there was a magic pill to banish them from our thoughts... I know you have lots of ideas what to do to keep busy - I have read your suggestions to other people. So act on your advice! The main thing I would add is to take advantage of the weather. It is lovely and sunny here and you are not that far away so hope it is the same for you. Get out, go for a walk. I presume the sea is not that far away from you? Sea air makes me feel good especially on a good day. Must be my Blackpool upbringing! :). If not, a nice local park? Go with a friend if you can, if not go on your own. Treat yourself to a '99'. Fresh air might mean you get a better night's sleep too. It has been said before but worrying is not going to change your results. So if anything pops in your head, tell yourself you are not going to think about it. I know how difficult it is. Same with getting your results. Tell yourself it is out of your control, there is nothing you can do so be firm with yourself and tell yourself not to think about it. Imagine redecorating your room, what would you have done? A new clothes wardrobe, what would you buy? I don't know if books/ magazines help. Personally I find it hard to concentrate on anything new, but I have gone back and reread books I have enjoyed in the past, more slowly this time, finding out minor details I missed the first time round! Don't know if any of this helps, but have a ((cwtch)) from me. One of those always helps. Take care,  Gay xxx",

I presume they then peeled all the skin back, scooped all the insides out and popped in an implant all at the same time! It is a gel/saline based implant. I wasn't given the option of using my own tissue. I am a size 10 so there is not that much spare fat (there is some though!) but I was not given this as an option. I was not sure that I would still have all my nipple but it still looks intact, all be it a little sorry for itself!!! I only had a positive diagnosis on the 14th Nov and the operation on the 23rd so I did not really have much time to consider all the options available. I did think mentally that I could handle no reconstruction but the surgeon seemed to think that because of my age (43) it would be better to have one at the same time. I had the drain for 10 days. I had it removed on the 5th Dec. There was still quite a bit of fluid there though, so I have to go back to hospital tomorrow to be drained if necessary!

All happened very quick, a slot came available so I went for it, just wanted the cancer OUT!!! I wasn't really given many options to consider, to be honest I was just so shell shocked I just went ahead with everything that was advised. The surgery was about 2 hours long. The most unpleasant thing is the drain that you carry around with you and sleeping with it is very uncomfortable. My new breast does feel very odd to touch. But it feels good to have all my skin (and my cleavage) and I think all my nipple still intact. I am pretty sure that I would be able to wear a swimsuit/bikini eventually and no-one would know. It is all just healing at the moment. Under my arm is still quite numb and I am finding that a lot of my clothes irritate me around this area. I have daily exercises to do and my arm is still a bit stiff. I can't do movements above shoulder level yet- getting dressed can be tricky and I need help to wash my hair at the moment. Not sure if this has answered any of your questions. If you want to ask anything else please post again and I will tell all from my experience or send me a private message. Take care, Gay x ",

Plus we are very good at hugs, cwtches and holding hands to appointments - only virtually, but it still counts! Now take some deep breaths. I think there are two main things to say here. Firstly worrying will not change the results. Be kind to yourself and try to keep busy and keep your mind occupied. Get out, go for a lovely walk, cinema, catch up with friends. Try to put the worries in a box in the back of your mind, and recognise the worries are there, but you are not opening that box today.  Secondly beast cancer is very treatable. There are lots of different treatments options and your treatment will be tailor made for you. The fact that they are doing scans means that they are being thorough - which has to be a good thing. I think it is best to know everything at the start so you will get the right treatment for you. Go enjoy a lovely Sunday with your husband and children. Gay xxx",

I am a bit younger, but provided you have good mobility in your shoulder area now, I can't see why you shouldn't get back to that stage. Take care, Gay xxx",

It;s weird to think that your own body turns itself against itself - what is that all about!? Anyway for both of us, ovaries out and on AIs - the best things possible!

      "Content": "Hiya Charlene70 and Jojoboobs,  Firstly, both of these drugs affect different people in different ways. There is no point worrying about possible side effects - when they might not happen to you. Remember people often use online sites like this when they want advice and support. A person doing great with no side effects would not necessarily bother to post.  Personally I am on letrozole, I was on zoladex for several months and just over a week ago had my ovaries out. In my case, studies show that letrozole is the best choice for someone in my situation who had lots of lymph involvement, a large tumour and lobular bc. Everybody's bc is different, your team will suggest that you take the best one for YOU in your circumstances. Of course you don't have to take it and you can ask for alternatives. I found with letrozole that I have a few side effects - achy fingers, few hot flushes - but all mild, nothing I can't cope with. The side effects were more noticeable to begin with and they settled down. I make sure that I always stick to the same brand - can be a nuisance at times because pharmacies don;t always keep the same brands in stock. Different brands can affect people differently so if I start having problems, I will consider changing brands. I also have the choice of changing to other aromatase inhibitors eg anastrozole or exemestane. So there are different options.  Tamoxifen and letrozole have many similar side effects - menopausal ones!! However letrozole also causes bone thinning (may lead to osteoporosis) and more joint pain, more cholesterol and for me it has increased my blood pressure (so I now take tablets to reduce it!!) Tamoxifen on the other hand increases bone strength and may reduce cholesterol.  (Tamoxifen can also have different side effects but they are rare). I don't think either of you had chemo, so therefore on balance it might seem that tamoxifen is the best option or at least it seems that is what you both have been offered??? Oestrogen is also produced by other cells in your body so even if your periods have stopped, there will still be some present  - no idea of how much without looking it up. Cwtches,  Gay xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I had mastectomy and immediate recon in November. I only had 9 days from positive diagnosis to op so I went through it all in a sense of shock. I agree with lots of the comments here. A front fitting bra is a good idea - I did at one point get stuck trying to take off a sports bra that fitted rather too sugly at the back, had to call other half for help. Front opening pjs, dressing gown, eye mask, lip balm, moisturising lotion, kindle all needed.  My biggest fear was the anaesthetic as I had never had one before. The hospital staff are wonderful and they are used to dealing with it. I got a shock as I walked into the theatre room and saw all the lights etc - I thought I would be put to sleep in another room and then wheeled in! But as I say all staff were wonderful and were reassuring.  After the anaesthetic wore off later that night, I had no issues with mobility. Just had to make sure the drain leads don't get caught anywhere! Pain killers took all pain away. I am overall pleased with my new booby - although it is a bit more pert than the other one! Take care, I'll be thinking off you. Gay xxx",
