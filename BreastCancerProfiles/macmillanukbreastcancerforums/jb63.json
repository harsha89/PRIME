      "Content": "Hi Your pains could be due to after effects of chemo I have the same problems in my joints and fingers I can't open packets and do buttons etc and if I walk too far my ankles knees and hips play up getting out of bed at night is fun too.  I am on letrozole not tamoxifen my gp has prescribed pregablin and 30mg codiene for pains which help a bit.  Lucky me my finger nails decided to come off this weekend this rollercoaster is so much fun. I would check with your oncologist just to make sure what is causing these annoying aches and pains Maxinem  I was told they can last for months so I will just take things a day at a time and fingers crossed things will get better",

      "Content": "Hi Was diagnosed with grade 3 Idc in December 2016 had 2 ops lymph node removal found in 3/20 chemo 3 EC 3 Docataxol had picc line fitted ended up in hospital with neutropenia sepsis and blood clot from picc line last chemo June 17 then 15 radiotherapy And letrozole for 10 years  Since last chemo had peripheral neuropathy and after starting letrozole bad joint pains am currently taking morning 300 mg pregablin 2.5mg apixaban and nighttime 300mg pregablin 30mg amitryptaline 60mg codiene 2.5 mg letrozole and 2.5mg apixaban  My gp sent me to pain management who have said to trial duloxetine. Is anyone else on this much medication  As the only plus I have at the moment is the amitryptaline is giving me a good sleep at night nothing really seems to be  helping lol thought after treatments finished I would bounce back but am still off work with no idea when I will be able to go back",
