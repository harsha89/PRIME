    "Content": "I just got diagnosed with infected cellulitis in my breast following surgery and radiation (finished in April).  They said it's a complication, and I am on Augmentin - and going back  to be checked again next Monday.  The whole breast is swollen, red and very hot..  It hasn't improved so far this week.  They mentioned IV treatment might be necessary.  Any tips gratefully received.",
