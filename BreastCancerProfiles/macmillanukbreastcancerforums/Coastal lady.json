      "Content": "Hi everyone  Quick q if I may. I was diagnosed with stage 2 lobular BC in my left Breast last November. Since then I've had a mx (no lymph node involvement) & immediate recon, gave Chemo a swerve and went straight to 15 sessions of rads. I've been taking Anastrozole for the last 3 and a half months. I started with Accord brand but experienced sever joint pain - to the point where I could barely hold a pen & my 89 year old mother was getting out of a chair quicker thank I was. I also experienced severe rib pain. I switched to arimidex and the symptoms were much reduced. But last weekend the rib pain started again but this time on my RIGHT side. It's now v severe. And again I'm having problems getting out of a chair ( should I change my chairs ?!!) I'm pretty sure it's the ARIMIDEX but it is super painful & of course my normally subjective Brain has started to go into overdrive.I've started my phased return, but am now dreading long car journeys etc as I understand the OCCH Doc is quite unsympathetic. Anyway this is a long bc winded way of asking if anyone else has experienced the stabbing rib pain on ny version of Anastrozole plse ? I've been told repeatedly that I no longer have any cancer left after they removed my tumour- but with this pain, I'm imaging the worst ! Thanks for your help in advance.  ",

      "Content": "Hi AndyLou.. I had mine just before Xmas.  I agree with Maxine.. also suggest front fastening bras too - I bought a couple from Amazon .. they were easier to do up initially, when arm movement is a bit limited.  I also bought a couple of blouses/shirts to button up the front - I normally wear t shirt type tops and they would have defeated me in the first few days! I also borrowed a couple of my husbands shirts to ring the changes. Cardigans are great too. I was given my little cotton bag for the drains. I also took in front fastening night shirt for the hospital stay. I also borrowed a travel kettle for the first few weeks .. we have a heavy kettle normally and when no one was at home I couldn't lift that to make a cuppa - it was invaluable when everyone went back to work or college and couldn't be my willing slave !  If you have access to an A frame pillow too .. that might help sleeping at night - i found sleeping on my back tricky and this helped me feel supported & less vulnerable.  Good luck for Wednesday ... I was very relieved to have it over when mine was done ... although it wasn't the Xmas present I'd really wanted, it's all healed now !  Oh one final thought - so try and do the arm exercises they give you.  They maybe tricky at first but pay dividends in the end.",

I did reply yesterday but it doesn't seem to have posted !  As suggested, I have now called my lovely BCN whose advised getting it checked out so seeing the GP today. I checked back through my Anastrozole diary ( does this make me sad?) & almost 3 weeks after taking the Accord brand the rib pain started on my left side ... so I do wonder if it's that as I'm now 3 weeks into Arimidex. I'm v reluctant to get rid of that as although I still have aches and pains but apart from the rib pain, I can live with that. Although if they could get rid of the fatigue and hot flushes I'd be thinking I could cope with my new normal ! It's just v strange it's on the RIGHT side - so not treated by surgery or rads !  Thanks for the suggestion re magnesium and calcium etc ... I'm not currently taking any supplements as still waiting for a bone density scan. But I'll talk to GP about yst too As I'm so knackered anyway I wonder if I need Vit D as a help ... I'll update later. I really do apprwish coate your rhoughts.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I had a skin sparing mastectomy just before Xmas. I had one sentinel node removed & a reconstruction at the same time. Your bag list sounds about right .. I took some starbursts in too ! It was SO hot they gave me a small fan to have on my new side table to keep me cool - it was a lifesaver !! I had drains for a few days, and was given a cotton bag to carry them around in. I was concerned about dealing with them before I went in, but it was all very straightforward & I shouldn't have worried ! I didn't have any bras given to me, I took in a couple of front fasteners, and front fastening Jammies. I was allowed back driving after 6 weeks (I live in a rural area too, so this was a challenge - thank heavens for friends) , I was recommended not to lift anything heavier than a 2lb bag of sugar and no housework for 3 months.  I'll be honest with you, I found the enforced sitting down and healing very frustrating as I'm used to dashing about & multitaking. But I also didn't want the implant to swivel round and be left with a new boob at a jaunty angle while at the healing stage - so unusually for me I followed the advice to the letter. I, too, was told to keep up with the painkillers .. I had paracetamol (and codeine for a short time). I tried to do gentle walks as often as I could - but some days , the sofa & catch-up TV was the preferred option ( concentrating on books was tricky for a bit - so short articles and puzzles it was !)  !  Hope that's some help ... Good Luck !  All best wishes  Sarah ",

I've had radiotherapy but feel guilty about feeling so down, when I know others have so much to cope with. But we all do things differently. We all have our own cancer, our own fears and demons. We've all had a brush with something we'd rather not have had to face. I'm on hormone treatment now for 5 yrs and some of my ups and downs I can put down to that, but a lot of it is the shock settling now active treatment has finished. Everyone is expecting me to go back to normal, but every time I look in the mirror I know it can never go back to how it was. And I find that hard.  So plse don't be ashamed. I have plucked up the courage to have a few sessions of counselling.  I think it's helping ... I'm reluctant to go down the anti depressant route .. but if i don't settle soon I may do that for a while. You may not want any of that at all - a coffee & chat with others who 'get it' might be exactly what YOU need.   Everyone's different. Plse find something that works for you... but above all plse don't feel ashamed. X ",

I felt chemo was such a big step, not to be undertaken lightly ... but I really didn't want it if I REALLY didn't have to, but was wracked with the thought of this awful disease coming back because I'd turned down a treatment option. . I have the utmost respect for anyone going through it .. if I'd have to have it, I would definitely have done so but being on the edge is a really terrifying place to be too.

I was told pre onco type testing that chemo could give me around 2% benefit. But I was very nervous about saying yes to it (i felt it wasn't something to enter into lightly) ... but I was equally nervous saying no. I was coming down on the side of saying yes to chemo toward the end of my deliberations, but ultimately, I was lucky that my results came back indicting I would have less than 1% benefit .. so the negatives outweighed any possible positives. It gave me the confidence to say no to chemo ( although I do have the occasional worry I may have made the wrong decision). I ended up with Rads after my mastectomy & am now on anastrozole.   I don't think this post is probably any help at all, but I just wanted to say I completely 'get' your dilemma and am thinking of you.  It's such a personal decision and whatever you decide will be right for you.

(am reluctant to change to Tamoxifen as recently suggested by Onc as feel my body as been through quite a lot already) So for the time being I\u2019m sticking with Anastrozole (Arimidex) but thought supplementing might help .. I\u2019ve read a lot about Turmeric /Curcumin but am confused as SOME articles seem to suggest it can sometimes mimic estrogen (and my cancer seemed to love that!) but others suggest it doesn\u2019t, and in any case the benefits to joint aches and overall well-being outweigh that .. I\u2019ve read the NHS material and CRUK - and the jury seems to be out there too .. I\u2019d love to hear this community\u2019s views ..before deciding what to do .. my oncologist is v uncertain too .. he\u2019s all about the science, but is willing to listen and think outside conventional treatment areas - this time his slight reservation is about the possible estrogen mimicry & has suggested looking into it further ..   Any thoughts (other ideas) gratefully received ..",
