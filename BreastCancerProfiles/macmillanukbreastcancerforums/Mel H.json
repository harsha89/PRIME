    "Content": "Hi Jules I have been taking Anastrozole since January and like you I have suffered really badly with joint pains (and some depression) and my dr said the same thing keep going with it!  I have tried taking different pain killers but nothing helped, however this week I have been given Tramadol painkillers and I have to say I have noticed a big difference.  I am not saying that I am without any pain but it is so much better than before and I am beginning to feel like myself again.  Don't struggle on, keep questioning the drs and try different medication as I don't think in this day and age anybody should suffer. Good luck Mel x",
