    "Content": "My name is Alison I had a mastectomy a year ago, I felt I recovered quite quickly and went back to work in two months, I was lucky in that I only had DCI's and not full blown cancer. I had a back flat but looking back wish I had just gone for the implants only option. I have implants as well as a massive scar on my back which I was told today and which I already knew wouldn't get any better, It is very red and protruding, it looks very ugly. When I was first told I would need the operation I looked everything up on the internet as none of my friends had been in the same position as me so I had no one I knew to talk to. My first choice and gut feeling was to go with just the implants but was talked into the back flap by the nurse at the hospital. BIG MIstake for me anyway, I now have red scare tissue across my back and a big red diamond scare on the breast. I would like anyone with the same problem to contact me if they know of any way or have had any tattooing done to cover the scars.",
