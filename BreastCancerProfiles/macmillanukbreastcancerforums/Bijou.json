Perhaps that's why we say we're \" fine \" , it's better than opening up the Pandora's box of our true feelings. Then there is the fact that we are so emotionally intertwined with our family and friends, we are their partner, mother, daughter, sister, friend etc and don't want to hurt those we love with the real truth. But my goodness is'nt it hard ? .",

Trouble is that once I started crying I just could'nt stop, it felt as if I was dissolving in pain. Of course when my hubby came to pick me up he could see that something other than the usual paper flower making had been going on particularly when I wailed and sobbed all the way home, totally unable to string a coherant sentence together. Do I feel better for it ? - well frankly no ! , I feel shaky and sick and horribly exposed emotionally.......but it feels like the first step. ",

Mostly the conversations went like this : \" gosh you look well how are you doing ?, how are you feeling ? \"  to which I replied without fail \" I'm fine, feeling great, doing well ....\" None of which is true and in my head I just wanted to scream that I'm scared witless and am indescribably angry at the way my Cancer has robbed me of my old life. I play the same game with my family and even my wonderful husband, trying to protect them from the truth. What is this disease that requires us to be positive all the time so that we can 'fight' it effectively ?. Why do I feel that I need to support those I care for by hiding the truth ?. Even when my Oncologist or BC nurse asks how I am, I automatically reply with a chirpy upbeat response - why ?.",

I'm on 80mg of morphine a day which fogs my brain,  to try and stay on top of the constant pain - how do I feel ? Well crap actually ! .......and yes I know that people don't want to hear these things and that admitting how I really feel is somehow giving in to the cancer instead of 'fighting' it like a good girl ( do we expect people to 'fight' having a broken leg or Diabetes in this way ? ). I don't know, I think I'm just tired of pretending and feeling a bit down - does it get any easier ? ",

How can I go for counselling without my husband knowing that I've been lying to him for all this time ? ( he has to drive me everywhere so he would know  ) . I go to a cancer support group every Tuesday, we make crafty stuff like paper flowers and painted clay wellies ( yes really ! ) have foot massages and cups of tea but NO-ONE talks about their feelings - including me. I don't know why, perhaps we don't want to bring others down or perhaps we feel it's just too personal, much safer to share a lemon drizzle cake recipe than the fact that emotionally we're bumping along the bottom ! . This is the first time I've been able to express how I feel , I've been lurking on here for ages trying to pluck up the courage to join in and it has been such a relief to be able to 'talk' with others who really understand.....so thank you ! ",

Is it because we spend all our time reassurring them that we're always strong enough to cope with what our cancer throws at us ?. To my mind though, your family's lack of thought is inexcusable no matter how well you tell them you are coping. It's sad that you had to show how scared, angry, vulnerable and physically worn out etc you were before the penny dropped. Personally , now I'm ditching the 'Superwoman' act and allowing others to see the truth more often.  Tofifee ? .....never tried them , perhaps I should LOL ! ",

EVERYTHING changes......from how we look, how we feel,what we aspire to and fear, it's our first thought when we wake up and our last thought when we go to sleep. It contracts our universe so that we shuttle between hospital, Dr and Oncologist appointments and are so dosed up with medication and their side effects that we can barely function like we used to. But .....you know what ? at the core of it all we still are there, determined to grab life by the short and curlies and reaching those new targets we set ourselves. Cancer is not 'pink and fluffy' as the media would like to portray it ( especially breast cancer )  it's a nuclear bomb going off in our ordinary little lives and I salute all my fellow travellers on this journey.",

      "Content": "Hi - I'm at stage 4 with secondaries in my spine. I was already at this stage when I was diagnosed and over a year later my latest MRI and CT scans shows that my tumours have stabilised with no spread elsewhere. I'm currently on Anastrozole ( loads of side effects but it seems to be working ) and have had only one massive course of Radiotherapy but no surgery or chemo so I guess that kind of makes me lucky ? . I'm confused though about the physical changes I'm going through. I've shrunk from 5ft 4 to just under 4ft. My face and tummy are bloated ( Steroids ? ) and I have developed scoliosis of the spine which makes me hunched over. Has anyone else had these kind of physical changes and did things improve ?.  I feel fine generally and my pain is well controlled so that I'm able to do most things, I have read that if the secondaries remain only in my spine, although this is incurable it is treatable and I could go on for many years despite being at Stage 4 - is this true ?  Sorry for the rambling post, I sometimes get scared of the future and just needed to talk to others who may be going through the same things. ",

I will post in the other forum too to see if anyone there has experienced the same things.  Weird as it may sound , it is great that my condition is viewed as being a chronic long term condition rather than an automatic death sentence , I guess it's part of learning to live with the 'new norm ' for me.
