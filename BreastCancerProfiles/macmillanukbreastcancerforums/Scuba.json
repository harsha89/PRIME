      "Content": "Hi Sharkay, just to echo what others have said....please don't bottle things up out of fear of upsetting others.  Your own thoughts, emotions and reactions are really enough to deal with already, you can't hold yourself responsible for the feelings of others, it's too much.  I'm new to this too and haven't had my surgery yet but I've been quite open with everyone about what I'm thinking and I think that has helped some people feel more comfortable to talk about it too.  I think we all make assumptions (often incorrectly) about what how other people might think and react and sometimes it means that we get more stressed than necessary.  I don't want to tell you what to do obviously but if people cry, that's fine, let them deal with their own emotions- in fact friends that you can cry with are truly friends and when the laughter comes its just as precious.  If all that is too difficult right now, use this site as an outlet, people on here are more supportive than anywhere.  I hope the pain subsides quickly x",

      "Content": "Hi Mattyg,  that's fantastic news and I'm so happy for you both.  My own diagnosis is only a couple of weeks old and your post here made me cry...with hope as much as anything else.  It sounds like neither of you are going to allow any more time to be robbed from your family and cheers to that.  Have a fantastic holiday and thanks for posting the good news x",
