    "Content": "I have just joined this site and group because i would like to pose a question. How can you differentiate between the normal breast lobe lumps and bumps and ones that should not be there? I have been recently examining myself and also have an odd feeling in my breast, not a pain or an ache, but just an odd sensation. Now i am just wondering if i am imagining the fact that there may be a lump there when there isn't. I want to be sure before going to the doctor, as it will be rather embarrassing if a normal lobe lump turns out to be nothing than just that. I have probably come across as being rather dim on this one, as at 48 i should know my body, but i just want to be sure as well. Any help with this would be greatfully appreciated.",
