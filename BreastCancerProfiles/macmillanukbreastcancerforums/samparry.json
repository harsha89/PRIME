      "Content": "just thought i'd share this.  I told my 4 year old about the fact that my strong medicine would make my hair fall out - i said it like it was a big joke and so that's what she thinks it is.. her response was - 'that's funny you'll look like grandad'  since then she has taken great pleasure in pulling out my hair and was in fact slightly disppointed that it didn't all fall out in one go! kids are great - they take their lead from you and if you can hide any anxiety from them they won't feel anxious!   good luck to all of you   xxxx",

      "Content": "Dear Sascha rose,   I have not posted here for over 8 months, but everyday I read inspirational, desperate and everyday stories from the ladies here.  I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in april 2 weeks after my 40th birthday.  I have had chemo, and a mastectomy (like you an immediate recon was not a choice) and due to have radiotherapy in January.  I tell you all this simply so you know where I am coming from, not because I think it means that I have any idea how you feel\u2026.i don\u2019t, every persons journey in this life is so personal unfortunately we can never fully understand anyone else!   Sascha, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need me to tell you \u2013 you are deeply depressed.  This feels to you that it is all about your physical self and OF COURSE that has been the trigger for how you feel.  It sounds like you have had an awful time, with not nearly enough support.  Sascha, depression can be treated, you can come out the other side, feeling mentally healthy and if you were, you would be coping better with all the physical shit that is being thrown at you, I\u2019m not saying it would be easy, it isn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s f$$king tough.  Right now for you it feels impossible and I promise you that that is because you need some more help to stabilise your feelings.    I know that your situation is desperate with regard to getting help \u2013 is the Samaritan\u2019s an option?   But you say you are going to talk to someone in January \u2013 you are also talking in a veiled way about suicide\u2026..please wait. have you spoken to ANYONE other than this forum about your feelings and thinking about ending it all?  If you haven't PLEASE do!   I know I am a stranger and who am I to talk, but you have people who love you and need you \u2013 hard as it is to be here for them \u2013 try.   I don\u2019t know you, but you are a fellow breast cancer survivor and I love you. I was compelled to post tonight in the hope that you will feel that love coming across the sea to you.  feel free to personal message me, always happy to listen xxxxx Be strong lovely lady samxxxxx",

      "Content": "hi, my hospital put my name on a list and gave me the details of 3 local places to go to where i would be given a wig.  i was given a budget of £120 but was not allowed to use this towards a more expensive wig  which was a bit annoying.  However i have a synthetic wig, which is actually alot like hair and many people have said it is actually nicer than my real hair (i have honest friends!)  I did buy shampoo,conditioner and a wig cap and comfort strip which all came to around £50.  I wont wear it all the time as i find it a bit itchy, but good for when i go out somewhere nice.  What i did buy which i will wear alot is a clip in fringe which you can attatch to any hat, it has a fringe and a few longer tendrils at the side so can look quite convincingly like you have you  hair up under your hat.  look on you tube for a fitting video and you will see what i mean.  it is much more comfortable than a wig but frames the face better than a hat or scarf. My wig fitter trimmed the fringe but if you are wanting a bit restyle i was told not to trust anyone who is not trained in wig cutting!  I bought my wig 2 weeks after first fec as my hair was thinning.  was useful to have some hair left for colour matchingxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Annie,    I was diagnosed two weeks ago with invasive ductal bc which has spread to my lymph nodes.  My lump is now 5 cm and like you the first couple of weeks have been mainly dread and doubt!  I have two young children under 5 and spent a little while horrified at the idea of leaving them.  I know how you feel and that no matter what i say you will think the worse.  My oncologist described me as being on the 'slip road' to secondary cancer.  I had a CT scan last sunday and a bone scan on Wed.  Started FEC chemo on Tuesday.  For all the horror.... here is the good bit....that I hope will give you hope.   I have been symptom free so far from Chemo - a couple of mouth ulcers on the first day - resolved by washing mouth out with warm salty water 3 times a day and a small amount of fatigue early evening.  My Oncologist called me back yesterday (wanted me to wait 3 weeks for results but very helpful when i said i couldn't) to say all but one of my tests have come back clear (prob waiting for bone scan!).  When i look at my beautiful children i can accept losing a breast later in the year, losing my hair (any time soon) and anything else that comes my way.....just so long as i get to watch them grow up. Just wanted to say good luck Annie and that I have been just where you are, only a week ago and already things are so much better and I hope that they will be better for you too.   los of love   sam",
