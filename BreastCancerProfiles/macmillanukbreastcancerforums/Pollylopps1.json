      "Content": "Hi everyone, just had a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer. It is all treatable and i feel very calm about it all. My concern is that as a third year undergraduate my radiotherapy is scheduled at the same day I go out into placement which poses problems around the hours of practice required for my final qualification. Despite the research around radiotherapy I would like to hear personal accounts. I have a meeting tomorrow with the university to discuss my options but I really believe I'll be okay to carry on. the select few I have told are treating me like a broken egg whilst setting me up for \"a roller coaster of emotions\" I suddenly feel as though I am not taking this as seriously as other people think I should be. Hope that makes sense, look forward to your replys. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi there Ella It appears we are at the same point in our treatment path. My radiotherapy starts in approx 2 weeks time. At my last appointment I was told that I would be offered hormone therapy too. I researched the 3 most commonly used (tamoxifen being one of them) after which I have decided that It's not for me. I can't begin to imagine my brain being any foggier than it already is. The fatigue which apparently affects 1 in 4 people doesn't entice me either. I understand that everyone has a choice and that many will disagree with my decision but please make sure your choice is informed. There are lots of published studies out there for all to read.  I wish you well, take care. ",

      "Content": "Yes Runner58...mine itched terribly and blistered. Ask the doctor to prescribe a strong anti-histamine which will sooth it in a couple of days. The ones you buy over the counter aren't very strong. I take desloratidne which I get on prescription.  I also use cold face cloths to sooth the area.  Hope it all clears up for you quickly xx",
