      "Content": "Hi, I have a grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma (B5B) diagnosed begining July measuring 14mm. Nothing showing on MRI for lymph nodes luckily. My consultant put me on Tamoxifen due to us both having holiday commitments so surgery set for 3rd Sept...no worries. Today nurse wanted to see me and explained that she wanted consultant to review MRI again as she wanted to b sure surrounding area which she said looked like hormornal changes were just that but she wanted more biopsies to be taken. So next week will see surgeon and get biopsy done again. I asked her worst case scenario what if surrounding area was carsinoma also she said Masectomy... so I've gone from being booked in for a lumpectomy plus surrounding area to maybe a Mastectomy. The reason why I'm confused is my friend has had a triple negative cancer diagnosis and has had a lumpectomy but will prob have chemo also. I realise we have different diagnosis but she was out same day and my guy is saying in for a few days with drains. Will have to wait until second lot of biopsies to see if change in operation but would like your thoughts. Also my consultant in my opinion v. old school with ego!",

I'm totally ecstatic, never thought I could be so relieved, happy even, to have this done, at some point in the near future, with immediate reconstruction. He just wants me to get over the surgeries I've already had first. Cheers H x",

      "Content": "Hi Joy, Yes like you my Consultant wants me to recover first from the two ops I've recently had, hence putting off the removal of the other breast to early next year. My MRI showed other breast to be clear, but that does not reassure me so romoval is the only option for me too. I'm on Tomoxifen as still menstrating. No history of BC in my family at all but he did say we can discuss me having the genes test also. I just want to make sure cancer isn't anywhere else (even though lymph nodes are clear), before op and reconstruction next year I just want to be 100℅ sure.   Just me prob being ridiculous.  So will ask him about blood tests also when I see him. Thanks, Hayley x",

      "Content": "Hey Joy, Soz I didn't get back to you sooner.  You didn't say whether of not you have been tested re the \"genes\" test.  Not even sure what its called... BRACA1/2.... Why the hystorectomy????  I wouldn't have thought you would have that done if you weren't positive.  Anyway we seem  similar type of people in mindset, if you get my gist lol!.  I don't have any regrets re deciding to have the initial mastectomy and am just counting down the days till he agrees to have the other one off.  Perhaps we can be friends rather than airing our washing to all and sundry... I'm gonna add you as a friend.  I think you can work out yourself re the date lol!!!  Speak soon I hope  Hayley x",

      "Content": "Greetings Ladies, I have a couple of things bothering me.  I do believe in my Consultant and so far have had excellent treatment..... just a couple of niggling questions, wondered if anybody out there has either gone through what I have, and also can answer the questions. So diagnosed with the above and had all the necessary treatments so far. 1 month post op, feeling good.  Due to see my Consultant again end of January, he has agreed to remove other boob as that is what we discussed and what I want and he is good to go.   My concern is the size of my initial carcinoma 55mm (which did not go into the lymphs) but they did find two further IDCs in the breast they removed measuring 5mm and 7mm respectively.  He said I wouldn't need Radiotherapy even to zap remaining area, just take Tamoxifen, which im ok with.   I just want to know when I go back and before the other breast being removed and the reconstruction can I ask him for another MRI for my upper torso.  If this indeed is the correct scan to have.  I just want reassurance before the other surgeries that I am completely clear.  I don't mind paying for a private scan, I just want to know what scan I should ask for whether or not MRI, PET, CT which is the more reliable and can see your body more clearly if you get my gist.   Would appreciate any of your views. Thanks, Hayley",
