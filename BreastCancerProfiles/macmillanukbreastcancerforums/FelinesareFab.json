      "Content": "i want to stop tamoxifen as it should have been aromatase,given my polyps history.  Only been on it few weeks, seeing doc tomorrow.  Aromatase wasnt offered as I have osteopenia, but I know I can take supplements for this.  Bone density problem vs Cancer problem...a no brainer. Any advice.  None of the professionals seem helpful and oncologist only gave me three mins of her time. Ie live alone,  no real support  so another op isnt on my agenda.  ",

      "Content": "Hi I have had breast lumpectomy,  clear nodes, now on the dreaded Tamoxifen, waiting  for radio therapy programme.  I live alone, divorced, no children,  68, told I am glamorous etc, still working part time as my pension is small. Family have never been supportive,  friends too busy to spend much time, tho I've spent a load of times visiting them, the excuse being  that I have   no ties, freer to visit etc, which I do! All the help booklets go on about family or friends support and don't take into account the people like me who don't have reliable help. Ok, my cancer wasn't interesting,  or serious in relation to others,  but I've changed from being an independent woman who travels alone, socialises alone, to this prisoner at home. There was no care package except a standard leaflet and breast nurse number.  The op has left my breast very dented and and flat,  considering it was a small lump.  I hate looking at it as it depresses me and I feel revulsion washing it. I wish I had never had the op, as cancers grow slowly at an older age, so how much extra time has this bought?   My confidence is very low, and I feel I will always be scared  this vile illness will return,  as another op, treatment   and abandonment is unthinkable.  Wonder how many folk are out there,  with undiagnosed   and serious stuff, who live to a ripe old age --without the butchery of surgery?  Because I've had a very unconventional life compared to other women, it's difficult to relate to them....cant talk about kids, grandkids,  partner,  never had a dad , independent since the age i of 15, due to horrible family circumstances,  travelled all over the world   with job, etc etc. Freedom wasn't a choice...it was necessity.  For this reason,  groups don't have much appeal.  What people , and the media,   seem to like to see is the plucky and courageous \"survivor\", taking part in umpteen races, surrounded by doting friends and family, cheerily smiling and positive.  So....what about people like me. ?... weeping a lot, coming home to nobody and nothing(thank goodness I have a cat), defeated...?  I am tired of folk saying Stay Positive,  or You're lucky it was small....noone with any type of this repulsive thing is lucky. And try staying positive with the sound of silence   24/7......     ",

      "Content": "Hello Heather Kind of you to reply, at least you have a son and a guy friend. I supposed have a partner (seven years in a relationship coloured by his alcoholic verbal aggression and continual let downs). It has been my experience that people in general let you down and in my book, there is no excuse for that at a time like this. Ive been there for others, as I have said but it isn't reciprocated as I am \"free\" to visit, chauffeur, etc etc. I veer between wanting to run away and take my chances, sell up this place(wouldn't get much for my house) and live in a country where the old are not invisible and where neighbours actually call in on you....the Middle East is like that, in fact many European countries are like that too. In the UK people routinely are found alone, ill, or worse. Show people a sick puppy or an abandoned kitten and the tears start flowing and the help is offered ..... older people - especially ones who don't fit into needy granny with a cardigan and a Brillo pad perm and Zimmer category don't get as much sympathy! Seems amazing that the best we can do for cancers is cut you up, bombard you with poisonous chemicals, radiation and tablets whose side effects need more tablets to counteract them....and after all that?....you're still wary. Forever.  I don't want to join a Cancer \"Club\", where all is focused on the horrors. I don't want to run 10k, wear a pink ribbon, sell t shirts, raise funds, tho I intend to donate. Friends like to think their visits make you improve: they get bored if you cry or seem down, and say, endlessly, Stay Positive!! My sis in law, doted on by half brother is an example of plucky survivor, and I don't take that from her, but she does not understand my feeling of defeat. Off she goes, with her backpack and walking gear, for her daily walk, meeting other walkers, going back to her spotless home, and looking forward  to the arrival of her hubby, her inseparable companion. And she's not alone in that scenario. I never went thro denial stages....I went straight into hot,  swearing, seething rage! People say take a day at a time...yeah, fine when you're  20 something and have years ahead to waste, but this waiting game isn't for older ,independent, lively women with a brain and experience and a thirst for travel. Speaking of which, presumably holiday insurance is prohibitive .....any excuse to make money !! Oh dear Heather, this is fast becoming a rant.....noone understands my feelings. And if one more person talks about the JOURNEY I am on, I will say what I think about THAT>>> a journey to me is a pleasurable thing with a happy outcome, and cancer treatment sure ain't that!  Hope your evening is good...I have watched dvd's, moves online, read screeds, no substitute for human company. ",
