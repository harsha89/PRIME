    "Content": "Hi I had neoadjuvant chemo starting April 2016 and throughout the summer. My lump was 28mm, grade 3 TNBC and having chemo first did worry me slightly as everyone around me kept questioning it and I worried about how aggressive the cancer was. It will gradually fall into place for you and you will worry a little but less once you've had your first session. I had few side effects and for me the hair loss was a big thing initially but you'll be surprised how quickly you come to terms with it. My lump had appeared to have disappeared- I couldn't feel it and it didn't show up on the scan after my 5th cycle but when I had my mastectomy it was still there at 24mm the little bugger! I'm only telling you that as I was offered lumpectomy but chose mastectomy and was relieved I had chosen that afterwards. Having said that the chemo had stopped the cancer spreading and I'm glad I had chem first. Chemo for me was the hardest stage but completely doable, the op was absolutely fine and again radiotherapy not as bad chemo and completely doable. Good luck xx",
