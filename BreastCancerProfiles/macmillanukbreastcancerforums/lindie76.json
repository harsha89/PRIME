    "Content": "Hi, My mum has been through the same as you ladies, she had an masectomy in 2011 and was placed on letrazol.  We live in Falkirk.  The treatment was abit hard on mum but she got through it and the team were brilliant. Unfortunatly her's has returned and we found out last tuesday, but we will get there.  Our local hospital are having a purpose built Maggie's Centre built shortly so we're hoping to go there as the nearest is at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. Wishing you all the best ladies Leanne x",
