      "Content": "I had a WLE and a sentinel node biopsy on 29th December to remove a tumour and 3 nodes. Recovery was going well until this week. I started to develop soreness and a deep ache through to my back, week limbs and all body skin sensitivity. GP diagnosed an infection yesterday and prescribed antibiotics. When I spoke to my BCN she seemed surprised I had an infection but didn't offer any other explanation for my symptoms. I'm interested to know if anyone else develop ped issues weeks after surgery and the possible causes.  ",
