    "Content": "My mum was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. It had started as a rash on her breast and our GP assumed that it was an infection and sent her away for a week with some medication. His reaction to her rash was to look at her as if she had come from another planet! A week later the rash had still not disappear so she was then sent for a full breast screening - which is when she was diagnosed. When I found out she had breast cancer I was obviously very distressed and I suffered pains in my chest and in particular in my left breast (I realised that this was probably stressed related). Not wishing to visit my GP (my mum and I are under the same GP) who from experience tends to want you in an out again as soon as possible, I went to a NHS walk in centre. What a difference! I realise that they have to take more care as they do not have your medical records to hand but when I explained my situation they gave me the full MOT - pulse, heartbeat, blood pressure and even arranged for a female nurse to check my breasts. She checked them on my side, on my back, sat up, hands behind my head the lot. When I asked my mum if our GP had done this she said no he had just felt them as normal. I may well ask to change my GP as I have no faith in him at all.",
