      "Content": "Hi Karen, I can sympathise with you. I was put on Tamoxifen even when I'm post menopausal because of it being less damaging to the bones. However I had so many side-effects that my oncologist changed it for Letrozole. The accord did suit me better regarding the low lactose content because I'm lactose intolerant as there is no lactose free letrozole out there. But after three months on the Letrozole, the bone pains and the muscle pains along with dizziness, unstable on my feet and fuzzy head, just to name a few of those unbearable side-effects, i went back to my oncologist. He took pity of me and agreed for me to stop any hormone therapy until my next mammogram at the beginning of August. I just have to remain positive and look after myself as best as I can until them. I hope I don't have to go back to any of the four hormone therapies as there are similar debilitating side effects with Tamoxifen, Letrozole. Exemestane or Anastrozole....  At the end of the day it will be weighing up whether it's worth putting up with debilitating side-effects for 5-10 years and still no guaranty that the cancer won't come back or have a reasonable quality of life and hope and pray the cancer won't come back!!!!! Good luck Karen but be happy with your decision",

      "Content": "Hi Flopsyuk, I am 7 months post lumpectomy and 4 months post Rad. My left breast is continually going through changes. I lost the original skin on that nipple, then a big crust covered the nipple, then now it's just darker and thicker looking. I've seen my Oncologist a few times since and he has been very patient with me. I agree with Sheila Bee. The healing process does take time and it's different for everyone. I still have a lot of pain & discomfort. My green dye is still very visible... it goes on and on the changes and side-effects of it all. But I try to remain positive and be thankful that I've still got my breasts and that my cancer was only ER+, HER2-, grade 3 invasive Lobular carcinoma. There are a lot of worst ones out there. Thank you all for your input on the community on line. It is always reassuring & comforting to read about all the experiences, even the struggles. Thank you all for sharing, best wishes to all...",

      "Content": "Hi Stevie Q, I, too am on Calcium tabs, vit.D and alendronate (alendronic acid). I have osteoporosis on my lower spine and hips. My last scan was Oct.2016 so my next one will be next year Oct 2018. Unfortunately I had to stop taking Letrozole as the side-effects and bone pains were unbearable. I have Fibromyalgia as well. So all in all I decided to take my health into my own hand and did some research. I've started to take magnesium supplements, so far so good... I wish you well, sorry if my story doesn't really answer your queries, take care, Warm regards, Evergreen333 ",
