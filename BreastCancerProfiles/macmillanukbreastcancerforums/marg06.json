      "Content": "Hi there firstly let me say how sorry i am to hear your news i feel for you  I was diagnosed with the same five weeks ago and was operated the next week in Glasgow  i am now on hormone tablets and awaiting radiotherapy  i like you if they had left me would be climbing the walls but i would say trust your docs and they will do the best they can  . i dont think they would leave you that long to allow this to go any further . Re the radiotherapy the waiting list in glasgow is roughly 6 weeks after you see the radiotherapists so thats standard  good luck and please keep us updated  regards  Margt x ",
