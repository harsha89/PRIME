      "Content": "Hi Judith Hope your chemo went ahead on Wednesday and you are not feeling too bad! Its 6 months since my chemo ended and now feels like a distant memory. I seemed to get through mine ok. On the subject of Herceptin when i read some of your replies i realised everyone else could be quite specific about how long it takes and i couldnt! So off i trotted on Thursday to the treatment unit determined to pay attention to what goes on (usually i park myself in the seat and blether till its time to go home paying no attention at all!) My session lasted 4 hours in total from arrival to departure. I have Piriton+Hydrocortisone in my IV first then 30 minutes after my Herceptin arrives. It took  1 hour and 40 mins for the bag to be emptied then they flush through more saline. I'm not sure if it's because i have experienced shivers and chills when getting it that maybe thats why its been slowed down. My BP and temperature is checked every 30 mins too but i think thats the norm. The rest of the time was spend doing the cannula hokeycokey, steeping the hands,getting it in then out! I think i'm getting used to it now because the aches etc seem less. Well i hope my blow by blow account of my day hasnt put you to sleep! lol best wishes Moose  ",

      "Content": "Hi JBert I am heading for my 6th Herceptin on Thursday, i too thought a year would be a long time but it's passing very quickly! The first session took all day but it's not so bad, just felt  a bit cold and shivery. My face broke out really badly after my first but i slapped on Aloe Vera gel to cool it and it has calmed down a lot since then. I also have piriton for a week after it, everyones different so you may find you fly through it no problem. I have achey joints but i am also taking Tamoxifen and have been back at work so im not sure which is the culprit causing those! hope Weds goes ok. x",
