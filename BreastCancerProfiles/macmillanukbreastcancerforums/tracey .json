      "Content": "Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my right breast back in 2009, I had surgery, chemo, radiotherapy followed by tamoxifen. I was taken off the tamoxifen as it affected my other medication which I rely upon to keep my mental health on an even keel. After a routine mammogram early this year I was diagnosed with left breast cancer, this was a new cancer not related to the first one. When I first went to my GP I went with a left inverted nipple only to be later told i had right breast cancer. I have just finished 3 Fec and 3 Taxotere. I have an appointment on Monday to see the oncologist and the radiotherapy consultant. This all seems so surreal because I have been here before!! My oncologist did tell me that it was uncommon to get breast cancer in the opposite breast after the first occasion, but did also say that because it is hormone dependant it would be a good idea to have my ovaries removed so that i did not produce as much of the hormone which the cancer cells rely on to feed off, so I still have some way to go. Has anyone else been in a similar position and I`m sorry for going on but just needed to let off a bit of steam!! Take care, Tracey  ",

Could it be my own fault for getting breast cancer a second timeas I had to stop taking Tamoxifen?, a question I ask myself many times over. Even though my breast care nurse says to me \"its a good type of cancer to have, because it is hormone positive\" to me its still that dreaded word cancer. I don`t know what to think or feel.    ",
