      "Content": "Hi kammy, you're so right the waiting truly is the worst part, I've said I'll stay with her after her op as she lives alone but my son is so so clingy, I stayed with my mam on tues night just for some support and to have a girly night to take her mind off things, my son basically had a breakdown at school as he isn't used to mam being away from him, he's 7 and although he has stayed at my mams overnight, I have never once not been there on a night time for the kids so it was all very new to him but I'm worried about how he is going to be when I do have to stay over to look after my mam, he's asked to stay with me which is fine but I'm not sure if my mam will be bothered with him, I'm thinking she'll just want to rest, people keep asking me to go out or do things in March etc and I say no because I don't know what way my mam will be and exactly how much care she is going to need, it's so hard when you're going into the unknown Glad your mastectomy went well and good luck with you're chemo, please let me know how you get on Funny enough I came across the heart shaped pillows while googling last night and one of my friends is making her one which is sentimental being a heart as she is getting her op the day before valentines day Stay strong and please let me know how you get on Yvonne xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm new here so bear with me, right where do I start? We lost my grandad back in 1997 due to un diagnosed lung cancer, my mams sister has also been through breast cancer which, after she turned 50 tended to make my mam a bit fearful of having a mammogram, she missed her first scheduled mammogram but I persuaded her to go for her second, the mammogram detected a lump that my mother was unaware of, they called her back and she had a core biopsy done (and her lymph nodes?) we returned on the 20th January to be told that she did in fact have breast cancer and that unfortunately it had spread to her lymph nodes, obviously we were too shocked to take much in but that's all we seemed to be told and my mam chose (because of our family history) to opt for a mastectomy (one breast) and that she will need chemo afterwards. We have been told nothing else other than the date of her mastectomy which is a week today, is this normal? I'm all so new to this, worrying that it has spread etc, wondering what stage or grade it is Basically what I'm wanting to know is, is this normal, should we have been told more, oh and from what I can see online she should have a pathology report? We haven't got one (don't know if we should) I want to know as much as possible to get her through this. Thanks in advance X",
