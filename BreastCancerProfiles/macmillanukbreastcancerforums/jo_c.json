      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I just wanted to ask how long it should take for your periods to return after chemotherapy and zoladex?  I started chemotherapy (FEC-T) two weeks after being diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer and wasn't given the option for harvesting eggs etc as my cancer was so agressive and I had to start treatment immediately.  My oncologist suggested using zoladex as a way to preserve my ovaries whilst undergoing treatment.  I finished chemo and the zoladex injections in early March and my doctor said that it would probably take around two months for my periods to return.  Well its been three months now and still no sign.  I know everyone is different but how long should it take for your periods to return?  I'm getting a little anxious as I was only given a 75% chance of being able to have children after my treatment and getting my periods back would be a good start!    I would be really grateful to hear from anyone in a similar situation.  Thanks. Jo x",
