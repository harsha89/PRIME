    "Content": "I've just joined this group, having been diagnosed with BC 3 weeks ago and having had a bilateral mastectomy nearly 2 weeks ago. I find out tomorrow the results of tissue analysis and hopefully I'll also find out about chemo and radio - I've already been told I will have to have both. So many questions and so few answers. I guess my most immediate worry is 'have they found the cancer'? Unbelievably 'we' only know I have cancer because of biopsies of enlarged nodes under my right arm - they were the lump I found. Although I'm fine with my mastectomy - such a tidy job by the way - I'm worried as to 'what next' if nothing's been found. How can my cancer be treated properly if they can't pinpoint it? And, when my treatments have finished, how can I have an all clear? So confusing. I don't expect anybody has these answers but sometimes I guess it's helpful to spill out all my issues - I have a wonderful other half but there's only so much I can put on him - he is of course very worried to, though he's putting on an amazing front and looking after me very well. In that regard I'm very lucky.",
