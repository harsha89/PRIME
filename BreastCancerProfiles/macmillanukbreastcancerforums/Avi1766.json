It has antibacterial qualities (hospitals have honey impregnated dressings) and has to be 10+ or over strength to be any good. The higher the strength the more expensive. I have 24+ at the moment but last time had 20+ which was I think about £20 for a small jar. I took a teaspoon a day sometimes two and had no mouth soreness at all with second FEC. Now I put a teaspoon of it in a lemsip and it soothes my throat. I also bought some toothpaste with Manuka Honey in it to protect my gums. I couldn't stand the taste of corsydyl toothpaste. I still use the difflam mouthwash the oncologist gave me Hope this helps",

      "Content": "Dear Daphne I had my cancer diagnosed back in August in the right side. It was the lymph node that was enlarged and they say I would never have felt the tumours in my breast becasue they were too deep. Then because the core biopsy indicated that it was lobular cancer I was sent for an MRI scan. I was told I had micrcalcifications in the left breast that weren't cancerous. My consultant even got another consultant to come and see me to try to persuade me not to have a bilateral mastectomy which I was insisting on because in my mind these calcifications are an indication of cancer. I really had to stick to my guns because they did not want as far as i could tell to do my op ( I had reconstruction with implants at the same time).  When I got the histology/pathology reports back I actually had two types of cancer in both breasts! I had to go back for node clearance on the left because I had had a mastectomy and they could not test the lymph nodes. If I had not gone with my instinct could I have been facing all this again when the cancer in the right breast became apparent or could the chemo this time have sorted it. I will never know. What I do know is I had it taken away before it could get any where else.  I am recovering well from my operations. I have full range of movement in my arms (ops were in October) I have just had my third chemo. My implants are settling I think MIstyMoley on this site has them and says it takes months for them to really settle. It is actually quite nice having smaller perter boobs...I was a 38ff now 38c . The sensation is different  and I will think about nipple tattoos or reconstruction later.  When I really stop to think about it I cannot believe what has happened to me over the last year. I never understood what women went through with it.  I am 48 seperated and have been with my other half for two years. I feel sorry for him having to go through this with me it will be a real test of our relationship! You will make the right decision for you at the time. I just wanted to get it out of my body.

Have since been told those nodes were clear. Should be really glad they were clear but have been hospitalised with wound infection since and still on antibiotics (3 weeks) and its painful. Especially in evenings, its a stabbing pain. I took more tramadol than I should have last night and my sleeping tablet and I was still restless (the tramadol isnt even mine). I had implant reconstruction and I feel like I am wearing a contraption on my chest that is tight under the arms and I want to get it off.I do my exercises religiously.The discomfort pain from this is always worse in evenings too. I try to remain positive and little comments from my other half saying that I could be more positive make me cross because this thing is on my mind all the time and I cannot see an end. The only time I am not thinking about it is when I am properly asleep and even then dreams are related to it.I feel like I have had enough already and there is still so much to go through. They want to start chemo before Christmas I need a flu jab, my coil removed a portacath inserted and was also told i need radiotherapy too when I have permanent implants and they initially said I wouldn't need it. Don't be sorry about whining I know exactly how you feel. Four months down the line I don't think you should still be in intense pain. May be speak to BC Nurse she may have an idea. You hear people say about nerves knitting together...it maybe that. I like you have had enough...... my whole life has been disrupted and I have no control. Whine if you want to and I will join you!

      "Content": "Hi Lindsey I am just 6 days post my second chemo. I had surgery in October. Bilateral mastectomy bilateral removal lymph nodes and immediate reconstruction with implants. I am 48. First advice which I took from this site is to take one day at a time. Looking too far ahead is too overwhelming and when I do this I can spiral in to despair. I want my old life back ...it is not fair etc! Chemo is hard but I think others get through it ...so can I. The first day the tiredness hits like a lead balloon and I have to sleep. Eating is difficult that day because of nausea. The next day my mouth starts to feel a little different but nothing too bad. Oh and Lindsey drink at least a litre of water while you are actually having the chemo to flush it out, you will know you have done it right when your urine returns to its normal colour. I will also give this advice ask for a PICC Line or Portacath do not let them mess your veins up first which happens to a lot of people. This will save so much trauma and distress. I have found this time that keeping frozen pineapple chunks to suck really helped with the horrible disgusting fuzzy chemo mouth you have around days 3-9 (for me any way) My head was shaved on Boxing day after handfuls coming away on Christmas day. I really thought I would be cool with this.......how wrong was I!. I had a total melt down I couldn't reconcile myself to who the person was in the mirror I cried for two days.  I now experiment with scarves and little beanie hats and i have a wig for when i want to go out. My first chemo was the 11th of Dec and I was out on new years Eve and saw the new year in!  This site is a godsend Avril xx",

      "Content": "Dear Sandy You have had a lot to deal with in a very short time. i was diagnosed in August and did not get my surgery until Oct 1st. Then had second surgery to remove lymph nodes on left as there was cancer in that breast after negative biopsy and different scan results. I think I coped well  with the surgery I had immediate reconstruction with implants. I can be really positive outwardly but some times it hits me like a tonne of bricks and the tears come from nowhere and I can't stop them. I wonder will I ever be the same again.I have had my first chemo and my second is on tuesday. My friend shaved my head on boxing day because my  hair was falling out in handfuls. I kept it together that day because we went to my brothers.Travelling back in the car I started crying and I couldn't get myself out of that mind set for the rest of the day and the next day. My partner had to go away for a day and night and I was so glad to see him go because as soon as he was out of the house I bawled my eyes out loudly and let all my feelings out and began to wonder how do I get through this? it's too much, it is going to take so long my whole life has changed through finding one lump....I still do not know how I will get through, i have had thoughts  along the line of it wouldnt be so bad to let go.....but they did not last long. I know that i will get the crying days again followed by days when I feel able to cope. Sandy what ever we feel is allowed and is being felt by someone else in the same situation. I still cannot believe that this is my life. Big hug to you. x",

I have been going to bed by 7/8 (if I am not in it already!) I think my other half is beginning to think I am putting it some days because how can you feel like getting up for a walk on a sunday then want to stay in bed again on Monday. Wow Ali you have one more left! when is that because I will cheer for you on that date. I hate the thought that on weds I will be sitting in that chair having that stuff pumped in to me again and once its in there is no going back. I swear the best bit of the day on this tax is the night when I don't have to speak to anyone and can be left alone to be negative if I want to. We are not aloud to be negative in front of friends and family (you'll know what I mean) I am so fed up with the way my mouth feels and the thought that it stays for the duration of the tax is soul destroying. I have discovered Lemon sorbet that kind of tastes nice! Are you having a can't get out of bed day? I have to get up and pop in to work today to get a form signed. If any one says oh you are so strong brave lady I really want to say 'oh £$%!!! off!' that would shock 'em!  I won't say stay strong! just come on Ali one day at a time, when you have had that last one just imagine the feeling apart from the usual crappy ones that is!

      "Content": "Hi Dendy only just seen your post. You are only  two weeks post operation. I am assuming your drain has gone now and you are doing your stretching exercises that the hospital gave you. It takes a while but if you do them each day you will soon have your arm and hand straight up above your head. Lymphoedema is something we have to be aware of if we have had lymh node removal but it doesn't mean we are all going to get it. I am always checking my arms my wrists my fingers for signs of swelling. I also have what seems like a collection of fluid underneath my right side scar towards the back that I keep an eye on. Sometimes I imagine one of my arms is bigger but it is not. If the day comes and I think yes this is more swollen I will be straight on the phone to the BCN (even though I have had nothing to do with them since operation in October) insisting on a consultation as the sooner it is seen to the better.  Dendy we have already had a hard time and must now learn to live with all this and not spend every waking minute worrying about all the things that could happen. As time goes by it does get easier not to dwell so much,but I completely understand your fears. I f you want to ask me anything please do and I f I cannot help There is always somebody on this site which is invaluable who can shed some light with their experience and knowledge. Please try not to worry. Avril x",

      "Content": "Hi Kate I had 15 nodes removed on the right and 13 on the left. I also had bilateral mastectomies and immediate reconstruction with implants in October last year. I did the exercises from the leaflet the hospital gave me. I had a bit of cording and the BCN just said to stretch it out which I did. I now have full movement and I do stretching exercises daily. My arms appeared to have dents at one point but that has disappeared. My armpits feel numb but better than they were initially. I don't sweat so do not really need to wear deoderent that is a bonus! I worry about lympoedema as I have both sides to worry about but I will have to live with that. If you have to have lots of nodes removed I only had one affected you will be able to cope.",

      "Content": "Hi Ro looking through these messages today and came across yours. I too got my results yesterday following my bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction with implants at the same time. On the right side 1out of 15 nodes was affected and there were two types of cancer found grades  2 and 3. I had to really fight weeks ago for them to take my left breast as there were changes that showed up on MRI but they insisted they were nothing to worry about. My thought was if there is something not right now it will be cancer in the future.After loads of debate they agreed to what I wanted. Yesterday the consutant told me I was right and they had found two ares of cancer. I too have to go back to have lymh nodes removed as they cannot test because there is no breast tissue. I am gutted at the thought of more surgery I am just beginning to move around a little more normally and the scars are healing. I am dreading more surgery and still waiting for chemotherapy which terrifies me more than anything.  It is just take each day as it comes. People say you are so brave...I am not I just have to deal with what ever happens.It was reassuring that there was someone else going through the same.",

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, I was diagnosed August 12th I will never forget that day as even post surgery and first chemo it still goes down as the worst in my life. I really didn't think I had cancer when I went along to the clinic that day and was totally unprepared. What I will say and it sounds like a cliche but take one day at a time. Some days i am so low and tears come from no where and others I feel I can take on any thing. You will get through your surgery and you can deal with what ever else comes along a day at a time. I have found this site so helpful so much useful information you can ask anything you wwnt and someone will respond. Good luck for tomorrow. I don't know you but I will be thinking of you Avril x",

      "Content": "I have had my Portacath since November. It is clearly visible under the skin and you can see clearly 3 little points on it too. At first I thought it felt like it was going to pop through the skin. Sometimes I can feel like an aching kind of pain. It will eventually settle down and you will feel comfortable with it and begin to forget it is even there. I would think that as long as you have no signs of infection like redness heat or swelling it is probably ok. Chemo makes every thing feel weird even days after having it. If you are really worried the chemo unit nurses would look at it for you which would stop you worrying which I know is a horrible feeling. Avril",

      "Content": "Dear Jo Ask for a portacath to be inserted. It never needs changing you get to bathe shower as normal and it's hardly visible under clothes. More importantly it will mean that no more of your veins will be messed up. It's traumatic having a pic line inserted and I don't think veins repair themselves. I had one because I had bilateral axillary clearance but I still had to ask for one. I only knew about them because another lady told me about hers in a breast clinic waiting room one day. Avril",
