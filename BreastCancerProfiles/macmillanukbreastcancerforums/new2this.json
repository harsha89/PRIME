      "Content": "I'm so glad to hear from Dreamthief, Apple 123, ss1, and anyone else I may have overlooked.  As of now, I've had 8 radiation and 4 chemo sessions. My hair is very sparse, almost totally bald. My fingernails have been falling off, but nobody ever told me that was a part of treatment,  until now anyway. I'm also glad that I am not the only one who had no clue that anything was wrong. I kept thinking it was my fault not to notice such horrible things going on within my own body. But I truly had vague problems that I told my provider about. It eventually got found out at an emergency room I went to for abdominal pain. Anyway, I'm learning so much already! Thank you all so very much!!",
