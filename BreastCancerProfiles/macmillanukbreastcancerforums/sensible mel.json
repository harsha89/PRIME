    "Content": "I had exactly the same.  Really sticky, and on top of the swelling it meant that my arm didn't swing, but rubbed. There was some actual stick on the mastectomy wound, from the dressing and the nurse suggested nail varnish remover but in the end I had a bath and then gently rubbed it with my finger and it formed lumps which I could pick off.  Difficult to wash under your arm when it's swollen and refusing to move, but I squeezed a warm flannel up there and when it was dry I massaged in the green vaseline, aloe vera (I'm sure any would be fine) and that made my armpit work like a piston - smooth as anything.  A bit gross, but it slid around nicely and after a couple of days the stickiness cleared up.",
