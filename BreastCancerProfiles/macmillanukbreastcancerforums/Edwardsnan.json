      "Content": "Hi All, I wonder if anyone can help me with a query. I had breast reconstruction using a permanent tissue expander, the result was never good. Five years ago I had to have it replaced and it all went wrong. I am now booked in to have my surgery next month. My query is, does anyone know why my surgeon says the TE must be permanent, when I would prefer to have it replaced with a silicone implant?",

      "Content": "toxophilite Hi Edwardsnan, welcome to our community. There's no reason you couldn't have a silicone implant as far as I know. I would be wanting a proper explanation, and even a second opinion, if he's insisting. Hugs xx thank you for your kind reply",

      "Content": "mistymoley I agree with toxophilite . My surgeon told me that I would have expanders and then they would be changed for silicone implants.  He showed us one to feel what it would be like. When I woke up, I was told that I had permanent expanders and they wouldn't need changing.  I thought I'd misunderstood, but my husband remembers it as well.  In any event, my oncoplastic surgeon was so arrogant I really fell out with him for a while.  Anyway, it's your body, and I don't see a reason why you can't have the TE changed, you can always ring the helpline and speak to one of the nurses for more information, they are on 0808 808 0000, open Monday to Friday from 9am to 8pm. thank you also, for your kind reply",
