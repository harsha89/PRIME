      "Content": "Hi Lamonsea, That sounds like the start of a really good plan.  I'm sure that between you, your partner and your friend you can sort something out and if you can get a carer now and again it will be even better. You have spent quite a lot of time in these posts focussing upon what you struggle with but sometimes we forget what we have already achieved. You have raised three children, from what I understand a lot of it on your own or with you taking the major caring role, not easy for anyone.  Add in the fact that one of your children has aspergers and ADHD and has not become involved with the social services.  Not only that but you yourself also have aspergers and ADHD.  I know that this can cause some complications but it also gives you an ability to focus much greater than most others once you set your mind to it. You have coped with surgery and appear to have done so with admirable calm and almost taking it in your stride. I would check out what chemo the hospital is proposing and then talk to the others who have taken this previously to find out what the pattern was for other people.  It is unlikely to be exactly the same but it will probably follow a similar pattern of feeling ok, tired, ill etc.  Remember that if the side effects of the chemo get too bad the medical team will take you off it anyway even if you want to continue, so it is unlikely to get to the stage where you cannot cope with it.  I suspect that if you can get into a calm place, follow a plan and have some support that you will be able to sail through it. love and hugs, Gragon xx",

      "Content": "Dear Lamonsea, I happened across this thread and wondered if I could help at all. I'm afraid I have no experience of breast cancer other than having had a couple of friends who have suffered from the disease, one of them twice, and I struggle at times with the terminology. However, I have stage 4 kidney cancer and have on occasion worked in the past with people with Aspergers. When I read the posts from the other group members I pick up the concerns that they have for you that you are persuading your self to avoid treatment and they care for you too much to let you go down this path without trying to influence you to decide to take the best treatment is available. They worry that you seem to be accepting death as an outcome preferable to a some difficulty but with a reasonable opportunity for a life with your daughters for many years to come. I appreciate that for anyone on the autistic spectrum, change and uncertainty are difficult to deal with. Unfortunately dealing with cancer is a massive leap into the unknown and for all the advances in science it is still often a matter of trying it first and if the first choice doesn't work then we will go on to try the next one. Statistics are reassuring as they appear to give a very clear indication of what is going to happen but in reality they are just saying that of a group of 100 people so many will experience this outcome and the others won't. What they don't tell you is which side of the equation you are going to be on. It is unfortunate that your initial oncologist is no longer involved and you are struggling to have faith in your oncology team. However, although they may not be as good at communicating with you as your original oncologist they have all undergone years of training and have knowledge of what is and isn't possible under the system they work in. That is not to say that you should not challenge them or push for new treatments as we all deserve the gold standard treatment and over time it is difficult for anyone in any profession to avoid complacency. They should be able to explain to you why a particular choice is the preferred one and why this is, they should equally be able to explain why an alternative is not preferred. With regards to your daughter dealing with the changing situation will also be the same for her and whilst she will undoubtedly struggle with a new school and you going through treatment that is nothing compared to the struggle she would have if you were not available for her at all. You mention that she is already involved with the education social work team. I presume that they are aware that you require medical treatment and can put some additional support in for your family. I have worked with social workers for many years and know how reluctant they are to intervene if support is available from family or friends. Again my concern would be how likely is this to change for your daughter if treatment is delayed. Perhaps if you discuss with the social worker the option,s they may have things that they can put in place immediately so that your daughters have the chance to get used to them before they become necessary. Ultimately it is your choice what you decide but I think you need to be clear if you are making your choice based on your aspergers and your dislike of uncertainty rather than because it is the best thing for you and your family in the long term. You will be much more aware of how your condition affects your day to day choices and you might need to explain this to anyone you discuss with so that they are aware of how your condition impacts upon your decision making process. You said that you are not worried about the surgery and it may be because the outcomes of this are much more predictable and immediate which is why this is OK but the uncertainty of chemotherapy isn't. I sometimes find it useful to write down the problem and the possible options and the potential consequences of each option good or bad. It can make it easier to see which one is best and help us to clarify what our objections are to that course of action no matter how reasonable or unreasonable they might be. This has been a very lengthy post and it is useful to be able to discuss this sort of thing in detail with someone in person. I would certainly endorse what the others have aid about calling the helpline. I wish you all the best no matter what you ultimately decide. Gragon xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lamosea, My apologies, when you said your daughter was involved with the SEN team I assumed that the Educational Social Worker would be involved as well. I appreciate what you say about routine and recognise that this would be very challenging.  Have you tried talking to your oncology team about your difficulties and seeing if they can access some support for you in stress management techniques.  This might help you a bit in everyday situations as well.  Perhaps you and your daughter could see if you could practise these techniques together as they are likely to be helpful for her as well.  I know that some people with ADHD struggle to focus most of the time but if they are interested in something can focus for hours.  I knew one person who was never settled but when he started to draw or paint he would focus on his art work he could sit for half a day until he completed the picture to his satisfaction.  He used to use this to de-stress although he had to limit the size of paper he used as otherwise he didn't get the chance to do anything other than paint. It is true that chemo is not gentle but then again it is trying to kill the cancer cells in your body so no matter how much the medical profession try to make it manageable it will impact upon your life.  However, as I understand it the pattern tends to be the same for each application although this pattern does vary for each individual.  If you talk to others about how they responded I am sure that they will be able to give you more of an idea of what to expect.  There will undoubtedly be days when you really will not want to do anything and on those days you might need some additional support.  Perhaps on those days the children could stay at a friends, have ready meals or a takeaway or someone could pop in to help out.  The other days most people cope OK, if you understand in advance how you are likely to feel then hopefully you can incorporate this into your routine.  There is bound to be a bit of uncertainty but this is similar to the changes in routine that would occur if you became ill with an everyday illness. If you genuinely believe that you will not be able to make suitable arrangements for the children at home they you could involve the social workers.  I have worked with Social Workers in the past and know that they really don't want to take children into care if they can avoid it.  Apart from the fact that it costs a fortune it is often contentious and is not in the best interests of the child.  If the parents are not able to cope for a short period they would first look to see if any family member could take care of the children, possibly even moving to where the children live to do so.  If there are no suitable family available they will look to your and your children's friends. You did say that you do not have any family or friends who could step in, are your children friendly with any families who might step in to assist?  If not it would be at this time that the social workers could assist.  I would suggest that you ask your oncology team to make you an appointment to see the hospital social worker as they are more likely to be aware of the medical situation.  If your children do need to go somewhere then they would look at short term foster placement for as little a time as possible.  You and the children would still meet on a regular basis and as soon as you were able to the children could return to your care. There are a number of wonderful foster carers some of whom will have experience of both aspergers and ADHD.  As they would have advance notice you and the children would probably have the chance to meet them in advance and to clarify that it is indeed only temporary. It is likely that the chemo is in the best interests of you and your family and I do hope that you find a way to make this possible, I recognise that it will be a time of great anxiety as dealing with cancer is stressful enough for anyone without throwing in Adspergers, ADHD and children.  However, you have coped with this to date and I know that if you can manage to to cope with the anxiety you are capable of dealing with this and doing the best possible thing for your family. I wish you all the best with your upcoming appointments. love and hugs, Gragon xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lamonsea, My son went back to school today and I think his school must have been one of the later ones as his cousin started last Tuesday.  Have your girls started their new schools?  If they have I hope that it has gone well for them both. I haven't got near my Christmas shopping yet but am thinking about booking a trip to a Christmas market again.  My son and I visited Brugges last year but my wife's father was ill and he lives abroad so she had to fly out to be with him for a week so couldn't go with us.  Hopefully this year we can all go. Hoping that you are well, Gragon xx",
