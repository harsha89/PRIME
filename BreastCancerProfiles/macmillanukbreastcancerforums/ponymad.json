      "Content": "Hi, i have just had a WLE and a SLN removal at the RVI Newcastle last Thursday, the op went very well and i was realeased on Friday lunchtime. I do however have to return on Monday 7th September for the results of the SLN biopsy. Before leaving i was given a questionnaire to complete which is explaining there is a new technique which will allow the sentinel node to be tested while you are in the operating theatre and if found to be positive more nodes can be removed, saving the possibility of another operation, or radiotherapy to the armpit, a quicker recovery time as only one op needed and less stress waiting possibly 2 weeks for results.At the moment there is a widespread debate in the medical and nursing groups about the use of this immediate test and that is why all patients are being asked to complete this questionnaire. Has anyone who has been in recently for this procedure been asked to fill in this form and i would like to have your comments please. According to the BCN the majority of women seen to be in favour up till now. While i am on here i would also like to thank everyone for their support leading up to the op, and also thank the staff at the RVI for their first class care when i was in thanks Dawn x",

      "Content": "Hi Purdeybru, the day i was diagonosed i was fairly calm it was the following day the reality set it, my first step was to break the news to my nearest and dearest but still couldnt bring myself to tell even close friends. Since last Monday i have joined this site, been out socialising on Friday and managed to tell another 2 people, and went to see my gp who has prescribed me a short term dose of Diazapam which is helping me through enormously.I am now just taking one day at a time,i know it is easier said than done but i am trying not to let this diagonosis interfere with my life, even the family seemed to have settled down now which is making coping easier for me too. I hope you have some good support and if you would like to pm me we can share our ups and downs together, cause it really does help. Lots of love and take care Ponymad xx",

      "Content": "Hi i would like to thank all you lovely people for your support, the last few days have been like a whirlwind and tonight i have to sit and make my list of questions for the breast care nurse ringing me tomorrow. I have found it especially difficult telling my daughter (who is 22 wks pregnant) and my son who is working in Portugal and now wants to come home!!! I do not want either of them disrupting their lives. I am still feeling like this is happening to someone else at the moment. I have searched for a breast cancer support group in my area and yes there is one but there are no meetings in August due to holidays. I am thinking of going to my own gp to see if i can get any medication to try and calm me down and get me through this as i have suffered from panic attacks for over 10 years and currently take beta blockers, Has anyone had anything prescribed for them by their gp? I was also thinking of attending one of the Macmillan centres for some counselling. No doubt i will be asking for a lot more help and advice on this site, thans again xx",

      "Content": "Hi, i was diagonosed with breast cancer yesterday and i am feeling totally overwhelmed with the whole thing. My surgery is going ahead on 27th August and i have been given a choice between a masectomy or WLE followed by 4 weeks of radiotherapy. All i was told was that my tumour was small and that the lymph glands were clear. I do not have any further appointments to return to the hospital but the breast care nurse is ringing me on Friday as she says its too long to wait without speaking to anyone. At the moment my head is spinning and i cant even think of what questions i should be asking her. Please help xx",
