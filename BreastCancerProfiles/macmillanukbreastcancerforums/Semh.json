      "Content": "Hi Tigermum and Helen K, Jusr thought I would chip in re docetaxel, I saw my oncologist today and I am good to go for my 4th Docetaxel, Herceptin and Perjeta next Tuesday. After Christmas I change to 3x EC. I have been really lucky as I have not suffered any sickness or nausea, but he did say that EC was much more likely to cause these symptoms. So hopefully you too will be lucky and won\u2019t feel sick on docetaxel. I havent found docetaxel too bad, just a set of very annoying SEs plus a progressive tiredness though each cycle.  If you want to know more, just shout! Hugs x",

      "Content": "Hi couttleberry I\u2019m on same treatment as you but the other way round, so I have had my third of four Perjeta, Herceptin and docetaxel this week and will switch to 3x EC in New year. Then 13 Herceptin after lumpectomy and 3 weeks of radiation. The nurses in the chemo unit thought EC was harder! So I have no idea really. I think everyone is different and we all seem to have different but similar SEs. Anyway, pleased you are back on track after your tooth extraction- all you needed!  i haven\u2019t found docetaxel too bad, but it seems to play havoc with my insides and I am still having problems with my rear end! So much so I have had to take further advice from my chemo nurse who then asked me to come in and be checked over! So five hours later, and various doctors inspecting an area that doesn\u2019t see the light of day that often, a blood test with another bl***y canular, talk of blood transfusions and the like, they all decide I am not going to snuff it on them and send me home with a referral for a colonoscopy! The nurse then  rips out the canular and my hand swells up like a ballon and now looks like I\u2019ve been in a flight!. Oh and finally, DH has the mother of all colds and cough...... Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Morning Tigermum, hope you are doing well, sorry for the delay in answering your question but I have been busy getting everything done before my chemo tomorrow. It is amazing the difference in how I feel in my third week! Like normal hurrah!  So to try and help you and anyone having their first docetaxel, here are a list of SE that I experienced. I will say at this point that i feel I have tolerated it well. First of all the good news, I have not been sick or even felt sick at all, but I have been warned that I might find EC more nauseous!  I did get mouth ulcers on my first cycle, but have been fine since. i have had very sore skin, my face and hands have been very sore, I do have sensitive skin, but even my hypoallergenic cream made my skin nip. Got badly sunburnt during cycle two playing golf!  My nose has run constantly, with my nasal passages being as dry as dust, this has been the worse SE. My nose is so sore and for two pins, bleeds. If I go outside in the cold it pours! Disgusting!  Tired,  Need a sleep in the afternoon and bed at 9.00. Sleep was fitful to start with, but much better this cycle. But I have been much more tired this cycle, so much so I haven\u2019t had the energy to do much exercise, whereas in the first two I was still playing golf and gardening.  I have not had any joint pain, just cramp in my feet and hands.  I can\u2019t eat much, just pick at my food, but try and eat a well balanced diet of plenty of fruit and veg. I have lost 4.5 kgs!  My tastle buds have gone, everything tastes very salty, so my poor OH has had to put up with some strange recipes! Alcohol tastes like vinegar so have gone teetotal.  Chemo brain! Memory is poor! Just have to make copious lists!  My nails are very sore, and find it difficult to do things with my hands, I may lose my nails, so I have trimmed then to stop them catching on things. My hospital has given 10 days worth of WBC injections that have really worked, my WBC count is now over 8.0! I also get a course of antibiotics to take during week 2. Plus a drug to line my stomach (so no reflux) I feel this combination has really helped with my general well being. Anyway, I hope this helps and that you tolerant docetaxel well. In finishing, the best bit is that my lump had definitely shrunk, so much so that I can\u2019t feel it anymore!  Hugs xx",

In her opinion continuing to eat a balanced diet is the best way forward, so I am looking forward to a full roast dinner later! I think however, I will eat lightly tomorrow, but I plan to drink as much water as I can cope with.  My view is that this is the last few days my taste buds will be normal so I plan to give them a good send off.  Hugs to all.",

Your daughter\u2019s surgeon should give her this information at her review meeting. My surgery is booked in for 4 weeks post last chemo.  But I understand that some hospitals work on 3 to 8 weeks.

How about this then! A very well meaning friend on hearing that I had been diagnosed with BC lent me two books to read. They were basically about diet and how sugar and fat and meat are the reason why you get cancer.............. The first thing I did was look when they were written. One was 1997 and the other 2003! So I then turned to the index and looked up HER2+. One didn\u2019t even mention it and the other had one paragraph which went something like, HER2+ is an aggressive untreatable type of BC.  I also asked my oncologist his thoughts on the diet! He rolled his eyes and said, \u2018if it was that easy, don\u2019t you think we would have told everyone\u2019.  His advise was to eat a balanced diet and everything in moderation. I kept the books a couple of weeks and returned then with a little note of thanks......... Sue",

No way was I going to the hospital or getting any sort of support from the district nurse. Once you\u2019ve braved your first one, the rest are not bad. A nurse friend suggested letting the antiseptic wipe dry before injecting, otherwise you push a little bit of it into you and it stings! Pinch a bit of tummy fat near your belly button an push firmly but gently. The needle is so fine it shouldn\u2019t hurt. The spring loaded injections make the rest of it easy. Swap sides each day.  But boy was I was pleased when I got to number 70!  Just to let you know, I was completely fine on chemo and my wbc actually went up. Sepsis is no joke and if these keep you safe then it\u2019s worth it. Good luck with your treatment. It\u2019s hard but doable. Sue",
