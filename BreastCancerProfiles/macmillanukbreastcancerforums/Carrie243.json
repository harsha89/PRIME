      "Content": "I had a mastectomy in Aug followed by a drain insertion and alleged clot removal in Oct but I am still in pain, in fact more pain now than I was before, the whole chest wall is tight at times feels like its burning and I have lost movement in my arm, (I was fine after the mastectomy). I still have a lump under my scar that is sore and sometimes I feel like I cant put my arm down against my side. I understand the shooting nerve pain, that was explained to me but this other pain is stating to get me down. I am taking Exemestane, Sertraline, didrocodeine and was given Amitriptyline but I cant take that it makes me feel funny. Has anyone any advice for me please?",

      "Content": "Hi lovely lot I've been reading some posts and am v v confused. I had grade 1 DCIS and had lymph nodes removed then week after radical left side mastectomy, according to my consultant I don't need chemo or radiotherapy so WHY do some of you have chemo to shrink the tumour then only gave a lumpectomy, is that a better option? Does it decide in the consultant? Anyone know more than me? Xx",
