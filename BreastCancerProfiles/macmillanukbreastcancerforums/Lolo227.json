    "Content": "That\u2019s great news! I\u2019m getting similar treatment for HER2 multifocal breast cancer and am about to start docetaxel tomorrow for 4 rounds. I had an ultrasound prior to 4th FEC and was told I had a significant improvement at that point and the tumours were harder to find. I was told the next type of chemo along with herceptin is likely to produce even better results. Thankfully I\u2019ve managed to get through FEC with minimal side effects other than fatigue for a week each time and hair loss . A bit anxious about docetaxel but will just take it as it comes and see it as being on the homeward strait now.",
