      "Content": "Thank you for your reply! It was all a whirlwind and we didn\u2019t really ask any questions. The ultrasound showed she had thickening of a lymph node and they did a fine needle aspiration. Again what does this mean about spread, they said it was small, but does that mean it\u2019s already spread to the lymph node or is it a routine test to see if there is any spread? ",

      "Content": "thank you for this information. Its hard to focus on anything else right now. It seems from the report she has 2 small tumours. From my research this is classed as multi-focal. Would you have any idea of the significance of multiple small tumours vs one. Is this seen as more aggressive and does it affect prognosis. ",

      "Content": "Hi, so basically my girlfriend who is less then 30 has been told she has a mammogram result of M5 which from what I understand is malignant. We are awaiting histology. I was wondering 1) How accurate are mammogram results?  2) does this nexessarily mean it\u2019s an aggressive tumour and has already spread? ",
