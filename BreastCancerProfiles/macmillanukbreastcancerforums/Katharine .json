I am hoping the dose will be reduced but will see. Then my final one in 3 weeks time. I have injections after day 3 for 7 days and also take antibiotics for 7 days during 2nd week. I agree it is awful and you feel really really rough, but speak to your onc, I was told there is no need to suffer. I'm going to ask for stronger anti sickness, which I hope will help. I will be thinking of you and hope if you have it it goes well. Take care and keep in touch. Ill be thinking of you. Katharine. X",

I managed to buy an all cotton bra and after 2 washes is now really soft and comfortable. Before BC I alway shopped at Bravissimo, specialist shops, they also do an all cotton bra that is equally supportavie. I hope this helps a little. Katharine, x",

I found myself living in 3 week cycles and like looking forward to the 3rd week, building myself up and actually looking forward to the next chemo.. It sounds silly but to miss one would have delayed the hole process.. I did have to delay one but at the time, although disappointing it was necessary... You will get through and I found keeping a diary of how I felt helped. As I knew what to expect the next time. Keep strong. The ladies on here are amazing. There is always someone to help and support you. X Katharine.",
