      "Content": "l'm 27 and living with my fiance and we have a 20 month old son. l was diagnosed back in august and it took ages to get help in place. my breast cancer nurse didn't know anything about practical help and i rang my health visitor who was useless and said she could probably refer us to social services and get my son classed as a 'child in need' but that we probably wouln't get any help as funding is tight. that put me off looking for more help, as between the two of them, they did a pretty good job of convincing me there wasn't any help out there. luckily for us, we had a visit from our family health nurse after we had to attend a walk-in centre. she is actually underneath our health visitor in their management chain, but she knew her stuff. she asked about our situation (me unable to attend work, entitlement to sick pay nearly exhausted, fiance's work unsympathetic due to him having lots of time off already due to my post-natal, pre-cancer health problems and him unable to change hours and struggling to pay nursery fees).  she didn't say anything at that visit, but came back and told us she wanted to do something called a caf referral. childrens services at the council were involved and so was our son's key worker from nursery and someone from our local childrens centre. we discussed his needs and ours (has to stay in nursery as i'm unable to look after him and he has been affected by all the changes and needs the stability of his normal routine as much as possible). the council agreed to fund three full days at nursery and we pay for the fourth. it's been amazing. nursery send the bill directly to the council and they just deal with it. it's being reviewed in feb, but they expect funding to continue for as long as i'm in treatment. we even ended up getting free safety equipment fitted, courtesy of our childrens centre as we only had one gate at the bottom of the stairs and needed one at the top and across thew kitchen door. now i don't have to worry about my son wandering around if my fiance is busy.  i would highly recommend anyone with small children to speak to their local childrens centre, health visitor and local council to ask about a caf, even if your children aren't nursery age. you could ask about funding after-school care or someone to take the children to and from\u0080 school - the caf is individual to everyone.  p.s. sorry about the random punctuation and lack of capital letters, for some reason my phone is being temperamental tonight. the pedant in me is horrified, but what can you do, eh? :-)       ",

      "Content": "I have been trying to reply to this post ALL DAY. *breathes* Stupid phone. I'm 27 and I was diagnosed in August. I'm now post-surgery, post-IVF/embryo-freezing and a week on from my first chemo session (FEC). I consider myself lucky, because I found the lump myself and it was caught early, so I do have a good chance of a cure. It is still completely rubbish though - I have a 17 month old son and life doesn't stop with a young child, no matter what is going on. I found out really early on that there is very little in the way of practical support - I asked my health visitor about any form of help for looking after Alex when I was ill and the best she found us was 3 hours a week in a nursery too far for me to walk to. I'm lucky in that both our families are very supportive and have been helping out by taking Alex overnight or for a few hours. I'm finding it a bit hard dealing with the chemo side effects at the moment. The nausea has gone and it only lasted the first three or four days post-chemo, but I've spent five and a half hours in A&E today because the chemo triage nurse told me to go. I went so they could check my bloods as I had a sore throat, which turned out to be oral thrush. This has turned into a bit of a moan! Sorry! I'm not a moany person, honestly - I've just had a rubbish day stuck in A&E, in a cubicle next to an old lady who wouldn't stop singing. For three hours. Constantly.   Anyway, hello. *waves*",

      "Content": "You definitely aren't the only one to be allergic to dressings. I had to have my PICC line removed last week because of how the dressings affected my skin. My chemo nurses had tried every possible combination of dressings and various skin protecting creams, but in the end I cried defeat. It got so bad that when my dressings were removed and put back on when I had blood taken from the line, I had to go back into the chemo suite and demand they take the dressings off so I could just sit there with it open to the air until it was time for my chemo. I still have half my chemo treatments to go, but luckily it's now a different type that isn't so harsh on veins, so I'm hopeful I'll be ok without it.  Rest assured, your skin will heal from it though. I looked like I'd been burnt, but it's not been quite a week yet and now it looks more like eczema. I find Lush's Ultrabalm to be a really mild but effective moisturiser and it's the purest thing I could find as the only ingredients are organic jojoba oil, rose wax and candelilla wax. It's expensive at around £8 a tin, but I'm recommending it to everyone who has dressing issues as I really do credit it with helping my skin to heal (and trust me, I'm not a gushing fan of Lush the way some people are).",

      "Content": "I am, I had four cycles of epirubicin and I'm halfway through my four cycles of CMF, so I'm on cycle 6/8 so not much longer to go! I found epirubicin made me feel quite ill, not nauseous as such, but a really weird sort of 'stretched out' feeling. I could tell I was feeling ill underneath all the anti-sickness meds, which tended to wear off an hour before the next dose was due. I felt almost normal after my first cycle and even went back to work for a few days. The second cycle hit me really hard and I couldn't even get out of bed. I've been battling fatigue since then. I had my first Epirubicin through a cannula in my hand and it gave me the start of cording, which has finally gone. I had a PICC put in before my second treatment which has been a godsend (I'm ignoring the fact I had to have it taken out due to a bad allergic skin reaction and have just had to have it put back in because no-one could get a cannula in for my last treatment!) CMF has been a better experience. The fatigue is much, much worse, but I feel better in myself. I had treatment on Friday after my PICC was put back in (treatment should have been Wednesday, stupid collapsing veins!) and I find I'm always ok on the day of treatment, but then it seems to hit overnight and all I do is sleep through it. Since Friday, I think I've been out of bed for a total of four hours, but it's what my body is telling me to do and I find the more I listen, the quicker I get over treatment. How far along are you in your treatment?",
