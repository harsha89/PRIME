Painless but I didn't expect it. I take it this must have happened to others? Did you lose them all? At the mo I have 3 'lifting' and assume it's the chemo. Thanks  ",

I haven't spoken to the BC nurse but I ike the idea of soaking in tea-tree oil as the pharmacist said to be mindful about infection. My nails are lifting from about half way down the nail at the mo - yuk. Still, they'll grow out eventually! Good luck all. Thanks Nat   ",

I know it's early days and the nurse did say if it's still there in 6-8 weeks she'd refer me to physio. They feel like they need to be cut! Thanks for your reply - at least I know there's a good chance it'll go. Nat",

      "Content": "Hi. I had a double mastectomy just over two weeks ago. Had the dressings removed two days ago and the doctor said the discomfort in one arm is 'cording' as I had all the nodes removed. Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take to go away? I can't straighten my arm high and it's very uncomfortable. Will it get better? Thank you.    ",

      "Content": "Hi This sounds terrible for you. Did they do the mastectomy but leave the reconstruction? Or none of it? It sounds to me like they're not sure either and perhaps have to have one of their meetings to discuss your situation with the whole team involved with your treatment plan but of course that doesn't help you in the interim. What about asking your brease care nurse to help you get answers? Or your GP? Wish I could do something. Good luck. x ",

I have to have chemo and rt before they want to look at any reconstruction work.....but at least I knew what was happening. Have you had any more info? You should definitely not be left to deal with this alone and quietly. I hope the great macmillan nurse you have found helps you more. ndp xx ",
