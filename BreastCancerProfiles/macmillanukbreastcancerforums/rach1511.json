    "Content": "I've just had my 2nd chemo and I'm eating what I want to. Some foods I've gone off and don't enjoy as much, but I think listen to your body throughout this entire journey.   Rest when you need to, eat what you fancy and drink plenty fluids.  Good luck with your journey, hope it's a nice easy journey for you.",
