Finished it all now, so have time to think about things and everything is buzzing around in my brain.  Trying  to keep positive, but it is not working too well at the moment. Will let you know how it all goes.  Cyber hugs to you all.",

Sometimes we just need this help from others who have gone through this already to get us newbies on the right track to positivity.  Once again thank you and I gave a nice big Easter egg just waiting to be smashed to pieces,  Happy  Easter everyone",
