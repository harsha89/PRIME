      "Content": "thats great thank you for the quick reply's, im just wanting to get going now, hopefully everything will stay the same, they have asked for an MRI because the mammogram was to dense as im young so they cant see exactly the size although when they scanned me they said it was 18mm by 15mm,  just waiting on the HER2 results and a few others, it is very inspirational reading the stories on here, and can see how it can make other people newly diagnosed feel much calmer, i feel quite good about it its not nice but their are far worse things to have as this can be treated, (well thats what i keep telling myself anyway) x",
