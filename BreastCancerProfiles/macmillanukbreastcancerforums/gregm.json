      "Content": "Hi, Just to add what Gay said, the Macmillan resources are here. They do have to make reasonable allowances for you. When I was undergoing treatment I asked my employer what updates they wanted, they were pretty relaxed, just wanted to know general timescales if possible. I wonder if asking and confirming will put your mind at ease, that you're not over or under-reporting? I also wrote a blog and shared the link with the people at work - it meant they could follow my progress if they wanted (or ignore it completely if they weren't bothered or found it difficult). That stopped lots of people feeling they needed to ask how I was, or be embarrassed asking how I was, and meant my boss could be up to date if he wanted to be. I know that's not everyone as treatment can be a very personal matter, just that it worked for me. Greg",

      "Content": "Hi, Just to back-up toxophilite - Lucozade is not dehydrating! I had BEP chemo and whilst an inpateint (3~5 days each time) , lucozade was one of my favourites - it's great at cutting through the chemo taste and getting rid of the fug of hospital. I circled through the available flavours for variety. It's good for you, as you'll drink more if you're drinking something you like, and that wil keep you nicely hydrated. You want the extra fluid to help flush the chemo through. In addition, it gives you energy at a time you need it. if you don't fancy the calories, then there are zero sugar options. Greg",

      "Content": "Why is it the bad things (butter, full fat milk) taste good? ;-) Lucozade zero contains Aspartame and  Acesulfame-K, and neither of these are on the carcinogen list. When they fed rats the equivalent of 2,083 cans containing Aspartame a day it did cause an increase in cancer, but I suspect 2,083x anything would make you unwell! Human studies show no link between Aspartame and cancer. Acesulfame has been subject to 100 independent studies and there has been no link shown to high incidences of cancer. All the above is from the American National Cancer Institute and the FDA, which I hope are reputable sources of information still. For completeness, Saccharin has been taken off the carcinogen lists since 2000, they were included as health warnings since 1981 as a study in the 1970s showed a direct link between high doses of Saccharin  and bladder cancer in rats. Subsequent studies showed the result only to occur in rats, and not in humans and is backed by epidemiology studies in humans, and so the warnings no-longer apply. So, unless you're a rat, saccharin is fine. None of the above means I'm going to gorge on products with sweeteners, I'm fully in favour of the precautionary principle of everything in moderation, but I not going to worry about a couple of 'Zero' drinks a day or a week.
