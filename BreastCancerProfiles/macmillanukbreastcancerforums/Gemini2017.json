      "Content": "Hi Scaredgirl 34.  I had same as you - mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy. Then surgery, radiotherapy and letrozole. Also had dexa bone scan. I finished radiotherapy 3 days ago.  Everyone is different so try not to scare yourself so much. We all have different types and grades. Your age makes a difference too.   I'm 59 and post menopausal. So i take letrozole instead of tamoxifen for ER+.  Try to focus on work or every day life while you wait. I had just been promoted at work and started new job on my birthday when i got the news. I concentrated on getting the job done and set up everything in case i would need time off. I only had a few days off after surgery and went to work every day after radiotherapy. From diagnosis to end of RT it was 4 months. I cant fault the treatment and care I've had at Maidstone hospital. They are all wonderful. You will get through this....allow yourself to be strong.   When you find the worry getting to much. Stop. Sit down and close your eyes. Imagine a train going round and round a track in your head. The next train coming in to the station is the worry train. Imagine the train stopping at your stop. The doors open. You decide not to get on that train. Watch the doors close and when the train moves off, wave goodbye and get on with your day. If the worry pops back remind yourself you are not getting on that train today.  With a bit of practice it becomes second nature. Another thing which helps with this diagnosis is to accept what you can't change. Once you do that you will be able to focus on the future and be more rational about each next step. It all becomes about the practicalities and attending so many appointments. Ive rambled on a bit but i hope it is of help to you. There are many many more success stories out there so stay strong and believe you will be one of them.  Hugs.  Emm xx",
