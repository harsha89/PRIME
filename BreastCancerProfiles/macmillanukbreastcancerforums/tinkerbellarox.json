    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I'm new to this forum so please be kind :) I'm 23 years old and up until recently I had quite small breasts (or maybe average for my weight - I'm a size 8 and weigh approximately 8 and a half stone).  Over the last two months I have gone up 3 cups sizes without gaining weights elsewhere. I didn't think much of it. My breasts then became very tender and sore - at first I associated this with the time of the month, however it has not gone away when my period ended.  Around my nipples I have noticed small white spots. I have now found a lump under my armpit which tender and sore to touch. It is visible when I lift my arm. My mother in law has suggested that it may be a blocked sweat gland or cyst - which of course I am hoping is the case.  I am just concerned when I connect it with the other developments.  I intended to visit my GP in the coming week but would welcome thoughts on the matter.  Thanks Lauren ",
