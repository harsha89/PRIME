      "Content": "Hi Poppyseed I also have been recently diagnosed and had a single right side mastectomy on Monday. I would suggest getting a back size up and going down a cup size as you do feel a little swollen. I put my bra on literally straight away as I felt it helped to keep the drain under my arm in place (I've been a bit paranoid about knocking it out).  I got mine from matalan but I dont now what cup size they go to. I am wearing a 36e and it is just a soft support bra. I did buy a mastectomy bra from M&S that the softie goes into but haven't even bothered to try it yet.  I have bought a couple of front fastening blouses in two sizes up from my normal size and they are pretty comfy and dont cling. I also got a soft scarf that I drape over me as it disguises the flatness a bit until I get the softie insert sorted out.  The nurse said that a lot of ladies dont bother with a bra until it all heals so I suppose everyone is different. I havent seen the wound yet as the dressing is still on for a few days yet but it doesnt feel as bad as I thought it would. I had a google at mastectomy scars to 'prepare myself' . I don't know if my post is any help to you xxxx Mel ",

      "Content": "Have been this for three months and over the last two weeks have noticed my voice is difficult and strained sounding. I have no soreness and havent been ill so wonder whether anyone else had issues and if so is it reversible. It says on the leaflet that it can affect your singing voice but I didnt know if it affects normal speaking voice.  My period also stopped this month (normally regular as clockwork cycle) so I assume this is also down to the drug working. ",

I havent even ever seen an onologist but do have an appointment with the surgeon to discuss reconstruction next week. I have been referred to ENT department and have an appointment in two weeks. It just seems coincidental with the tablets though.. ",
