      "Content": "Thank you Tess, its nice to hear the positive side of things for a change :) I had to have my first injection of GCFS (?) and I was worrying about that until the nurse said that she had given it to other pregnant women.  Its just such an unknown, makes my brain go slightly mental!  Roll on 10 weeks and then all being well baby will be here and I can carry on to the next level. Thanks again xx",

      "Content": "Hi All Not sure where to start but feel I need to talk about what I'm going through as I'm feeling a little lost and I'm hoping there maybe someone who's been through what I'm going through or who knows someone. On the 15th Feb this year I went for 2 scans - one to date my pregnancy and one to see if I had breast cancer.  The baby was fine but then I was told at my second scan there was a high chance i had cancer. Since then I've had my mastectomy and a temporary expander (for reconstruction later on) and have just started my chemo this week. My baby is having to go through all this with me and with all the steriods and extra drugs they are giving me I am so worried what is going to happen to him and will he make it.  I'm only 23 weeks pregnant and he is going to be delivered 32-33 weeks but that still means he has to go through 3 more sessions before he's out. I'm SO scared, but I know I have to carry on with the treatment for the sake of my 2 other children and my family, and of course for my own health. Sorry if this message is all doom and gloom, just feeling very lonely and don't know who to turn to. C x",
