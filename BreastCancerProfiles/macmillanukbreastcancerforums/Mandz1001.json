      "Content": "Hello everyone, I've had my lumpectomy, sentinel node clearance and mamoplasty and and I'm home, can't say I feel great as I don't, just releaved.  The nurses were amaxing and I had to say in overnight, I came home with a drain that's more uncomfortable than painful, my daughters rolled up pillow pet underneath it gives me some comfort.  Only going to the loo and back and that's enough at the moment, still keep falling asleep during the day but I have nothing to do so that's ok. Haven't been given any info but I suppose they don't know anything yet. Take care everyone. Amanda ",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, my consultant said I can go on my birthday cruise yay he said I would start chemo the day after, I should have started on the 17th July but they said I\u2019m still within the 2 month time frame so will be ok to go, obviously they can\u2019t guarantee it but they can\u2019t guarantee it will work anyway.   Treatment is 4 x 3 week cycles of :- Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide  The 2nd week is the shit Week apparently.  Then the same cycle length but with docetaxel. Got to have a central line put in straight to main artery in heart for the drugs and blood tests etc. Lots of shitty side effects that\u2019s why I\u2019m opting to go away and have fun before this starts. Off to my daughters choices for gcse evening now and my dogs been poorly today so vets tomorrow\u2019s :-) Amanda ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone  It's been 9 days since my lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy and mamoplasty, my drain was taken out on Monday, that was a huge part of being uncomfortable, couldn't twist or sit on the settee/lie without it digging in more and was a huge relief when it came out, took all of the tablets they gave me and my mother had the kids for me.  I Had my bandages changed yesterday and last night started to feel the most excruciating pain which felt like contractios in my breast, I panicked and I started searching on here and it put my mind at ease that some of you ladies had felt the same and the reason was nerve endings and bruising which I have a lot of as I bruise really easily, anyway I did phone the ward and asked for advice and they asked me to go in just in case it was a seratoma, it wasn't and she had a good luck and checked all round and yes it's nerves, tissue and bruising, they have upped my pain killers for a few days as it's really painful (I always thought I was good with pain). Thanks to everyone that's posts on here and answers questions as when you panicking at 3 in the morning this site is a godsend. Having a chilled weekend as meant to be starting back work on Wednesday. Thanks Amanda ",
