    "Content": "Hi Lisa I am undergoing the same treatment as you (TAC). I am having my second treatment today. I too have suffered from mostly head and neck pain, but I had all over bone pain in week 2 as well. The head and neck pain has reduced in severity and only appears occasionally now. I managed to control the pain with paracetamol and Dihydracodeine. My Doc is pretty sure the pain is associated with the treatment, rather than another underlying cause, but I guess only time will tell. Hope this is some use to you - Wishing you all the best and a speedy recovery Booby x Â ",
