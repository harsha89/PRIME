      "Content": "Hi, thanks for replies. I am having my lymph node biopsy this coming Friday.  All the info I have at the moment is there are at least 2 tumours and one is large.  One is grade 1/2 and the large one is 2. I think I'm hormone receptor positive but my HER2 results aren't back yet. I have to have mastectomy because of size of tumour and also as its \"multi focal\" and have decided to have immediate reconstruction with LD and tissue expander as I have been given the option.  That was a hard decision to make! Have been told I have to have both radiotherapy and chemo because of size of tumour and wondered if this was always the case or just because I'm under 50?",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a full left side mastectomy on 1st May with immediate ld flap reconstruction. I came home with 3 drains which I had removed after 7 days which I was relieved about as I found them extremely uncomfortable! All was fine for the following week and I was doing extremely well with my recovery and pleased I had made the right decision to use the muscle from my back for my reconstruction as the new breast looks really good. Unfortunately I developed a large seroma on my back and felt unwell so my BC nurse drained it and said it was actually a haematoma as there was old blood in it, probably from an small bleed after surgery and that was probably why I felt unwell.  Unfortunately the swelling started to come back that evening and I had a high temp over the bank holiday weekend so had to wait hours in A&E and finally have it drained again - more blood - so a dose of iv antibiotics and a weeks course of oral ones. That was Sunday and the seroma/haematoma has already come back! Its really slowing down my recovery and my ability to do my set exercises.  Really uncomfortable sitting and trying to sleep! Anybody else experienced anything similar? Got any advice as this is really getting me down! Sorry for the moan",

In the last few weeks I have an aching tingly \"nerve\" type pain down my shoulder and arm on affected side and my physio is referring me to someone who deals with nerve problems as she doesn't think its something she can treat.  When she pressed area above my collar bone is sent a pain shooting down my arm. In the last couple of days I have also noticed pain in my armpit around sentinal lymph node biopsy scar and a hardened lumpy area at the top area of my reconstructed breast.  I don't think it can be a cancer reoccurrence surely as its very big and I don't have any natural breast tissue there!  Maybe its a problem with the implant.  I have periodic shooting type pains in the area too. I have a follow up appointment with my surgeon next Monday but will be worrying till then!  I have become worried about everything these days.  Has anyone experienced anything similar with implants?",

It feels like I'm wearing a tight corset. I put this down to my radiotherapy at first but couldn't understand why it was affecting my back. I saw my physio last week and she says the scar tissue about three quarters way along the scar on my back and down the left hand side of my body has adhered itself to the muscle and ribs underneath. No wonder it feels so tight! I have been given some new stretching exercises to do and she wants to see me weekly to massage the area to try to free it. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I'm worried that it might always feel like this! It's restricting my movements and even affecting my balance a bit as my back feels so tight. Any advice?",

I was told to ask for a car park pass on first day of treatment and was also given a voucher for complimentary tea or coffee for myself and anybody accompanying me during the course of my treatment so there a few benefits! I hope your hospital does this too and  I hope  you have only a short  wait for treatment.  Good luck....onwards and upwards!  Xx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Jojo I had a mastectomy  and LD flap with implant on my left side last May.  Recently, like you, I can feel a ridge or a lump in my armpit and a hardness at the side of the breast that feels quite sore when I press it.  I'm also getting sharp stabbing pains in the breast too.  Mammo on right side clear a few months ago.  I went to my GP thinking she'd say it was scar tissue or a swollen gland but unfortunately has referred me again and  my appointment is next Tuesday.  I'm presuming they will do an ultrasound. I am a little worried but think its more likely to be scar tissue or a problem with the implant.  Is your lump/ridge painful at all? Did you have radiotherapy after your mastectomy?  I did and I believe this can cause pain for a while after and sometimes hardening of the implant. Good luck on Friday, please let us know how you get on. xx",

      "Content": "Hi I had a left side mastectomy with ld flap reconstruction on 1st May. Had lots of trouble with large seroma on my back following the surgery which had to be drained 7 times before It finally healed, leaving the scar adhered to the tissues below so I needed several physio appointments.  I had 15 rounds of radiotherapy but after initially being told I would chemo I was told after surgery that I no longer needed It but could have it if I felt I wanted it! - which was probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make.  I finally decided not to go down the chemo route and so now just on tamoxifen for 10 years. I have a follow up appointment with my surgeon in November to discuss nipple reconstruction and an uplift on my opposite breast to even things out but that's all until check ups next year. Following the shock of the diagnosis, waiting for all test results from scans etc and a hectic flurry of appointments and decision making I now feel isolated, drifting and emotionally drained.  Everyone says \"don't you look well\" and expects me to be back to normal and happy.  In reality I am suffering extreme fatigue and headaches.  Pain and aching and an awful tight feeling in my boob and back.  I have recently gone back to work (part-time) and have a busy home life with three teenagers(one at uni) but I can't shake this feeling of \"what now?\" \"Is that it?\" and an awful feeling of just waiting to be told the cancer hasn't gone or has reoccurred. Gosh - what a moaner I sound!  Is anyone else left with this feeling of emptiness? Sending hugs to everyone on this incredibly hard journey. Shaz xx",

I think every ache and pain is it spreading!  I was told before my biopsy results by the radiologist doing my scan that she knew it was cancer then just having been hit by that bombshell I had to have 6 core biopsies taken and wait 4 days to have it confirmed. Spent those days trying to convince myself she was wrong but I knew she wouldn't have told me unless she was sure.  The cancer is invasive and in 2 areas of my left breast but they dont think there is any lymph involvement but will have to have that checked I think.  One lump is stage 1/2 and the other is 2 but as its in 2 areas I will need full mastectomy.  Think I'd prefer that anyway then I know it's gone!  Im still waiting for the results of the hormone tests and an appointment to be arranged to discuss what happens next which is obviously slowed down by the easter break.",
