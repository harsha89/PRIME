I saw my consultant today and I am having a mastectomy on 8th Nov. I thought about just having the lump and some of the calcifications removed, but he seemed to be saying that if the calcification was suspect then it could have spread out further which would mean there wouldn't be a clear margin and I would then have to have a mastectomy. It still seems a bit as though I could take a chance, but then I thought that I wouldn't want a second operation, so I went for the mastectomy. All I need now is all of your positive attitudes to rub off on me for the days ahead. I have really valued your support in these times and hope that I haven't been too much of a nuisance. I hope that when my experience is over I will be able to support others in similar circumstances. Look after yourselves all of you Best wishes Sharon  ",

I do have a poster with six exercises on but I wasn't sure if they were for just a mastectomy or for node clearance which I don't want. I was interested in what you said about bras as I don't want to wear one to start with and was a bit scared to ask if that would be alright. When I had the lumpectomy on the other breast I had to wear a bra to help the healing, but with a mastectomy it won't be necessary. Does the prothesis go in a sort of pocket in the proper mastectomy bras? Does the breast care nurse give you the prothesis size to match the other breast or what? Sorry for all the questions, but I have tried to put off finding out anything about all of this. It is a bit like out of sight out of mind. I can't get my head round all of it. Best wishes Sharon",

I've done all my Christmas shopping and just wrapped the last present.  I don't want my husband to have anything at all to do except the housework and cooking and washing! I think that will be enough. He had a nightmare last night and woke up shouting. He is worried that it isn't really what I want and that I am just being swept along with Doctors/consultants and relatives opinions and he feels he is part of it. He has always said that he would support my decision, but he feels that this isn't really my decision and that I am making it for the wrong reasons. I'm not sure that he isn't right. I have often considered trying the lumpectomy first and  if that is no good go for the mastectomy. The only problem is that I would need a second operation. I still find myself weighing up the pros and cons, but the solution isn't really good whichever way I play it. I seem to be determined to fight this decision to the end, but why? is what I can't understand. When I read everyone else's stories they seem to be putting their energies into fighting the cancer, whereas my energy is in fighting my decision. How mad is that!  Thank you Janet for the information and keeping with me. I know I'm a nightmare. Best wishes Sharon",

Now cancer lump and calcifications in left breast.  Feeling sacred about choosing a mastectomy which the Doctors have said I should have. Not having nodes checked because I had them checked on the right side and don't want 2 arms that I can't have blood tests etc in. Doctors said I would have 2 drains and a drip in my ankle after the operation if I had nodes checked as well. As I won't have chemo or radiotherapy because I 'm too scared I think it is a waste of time checking the nodes. If I have a mastectomy will that mean the cancer has gone from the breast and chest area? Any words of wisdom would be helpful as I have to tell the consultant tomorrow which operation I will have on 27th. Thanks",

I seem to just be thinking of how I can get out of it. My mind is running riot again. Perhaps some of you could answer a question I have-Did you all have the nodes checked under your arm and did you all have to have radio or chemo? I decided that I am having none of them and so I am wondering if the operation will be a waste of time. If you had radio or chemo was it because the nodes weren't clear or was it due to results of the mastectomy. Is there any testing of the mastectomy tissue?  I can't remember what I was told as II expect I was told something. I am going out to lunch today to a carvery restaurant with sea views. I hope I don't start crying, as that's what I tend to do if I'm out at the moment. Thanks again Janet for your positivity Best wishes Sharon",

I can't imagine what it will feel like with nothing on the other side and not wearing a bra for a while. I think I had a sort of boob tube bandage last time and I thought about it this time.

Firstly I need to explain that I have ME/chronic fatigue syndrome and I have depression and anxiety. The Doctors seem to think that t all stemmed from my first bout of cancer. I seem to be very weak and am only 6stones in weight now. When I saw my consultant to say that I would have the mastectomy suddenly he said that he thought that I wasn't able to make that decision and cancelled the operation. My husband was not pleased and I was so upset that I ran out of the room. It was left with nothing happening. My husband has written a complaint to the hospital and they phoned me yesterday to apologise and said that they would investigate. That leaves me sitting at home wondering and waiting about what will happen next. I am even more scared than I was as I am not sure that I want to go back to that consultant and there isn't really another at that hospital. I just feel so tired and worn out by the whole thing. It is somewhat reassuring to know that all of you are getting through your treatment and being able to move on with your lives. I hope that all goes well in the future.

The trouble is the longer you have to keep thinking about the best option the worse it is. Depression brings me down and I am in a bad phase at the moment and the ME makes me so  tired. I keep falling asleep in the afternoons. These prblems just make me wonder how I will cope afterwards. You all seem so strong and are managing to come out the other side. I'm not sure where I will find the strength I need. I will listen again to the consultant and hope I can make a good choice tomorrow. Thank you again Best wishes Sharon",

      "Content": "Hi Janet,  Thank you for replying. What you say is absolutely true. I had already started getting the house cleaned from top to bottom in readiness for my previous operation date. I will have to start over. I have already started to think about changing my mind and want to cancel it on Monday. I just feel that I want some peace and not have to think about being ill. The trouble with the cancer is that there don't appear to be symptoms whereas the ME and depression create havoc. If I go through with the operation, I just see it as adding more problems to my body and I don't know where I will get the strength from to keep going. I am trying to say 'stop', as you suggest but my mind is running riot.  I will try hard to keep away from the phone on Monday , but coping isn't easy. All the best Sharon",

I'm not sure if it is a good or bad thing. I am finding normal life a bit difficult and it feels a bit like living through a fog. Everything becomes jumbled and then the fear of the future takes over and that is that. I want to make an effort as my husband hasn't seen his friend for a while and he lost his wife to cancer several years ago. I think it will be a good support for my husband as I know it is difficult. I feel bad for taking everybody's time, but I think I will need to read thse posts throughout the week. Thanks again Joan Best wishes Sharon",

I think that I seem to have that nagging doubt that I could just have the lumpectomy, but reading what you say, I guess realistically I have to have a mastectomy. Are you managing to get out and feeling alright about it? (not that you shouldn't be, but I think you will know what I mean). This is what I am thinking that I won't be able to do. I imagine people will know and I keep thinking that I won't go out again.  I hope that your radio therapy goes well and that you are not too tired. I'll be thinking of you. Best wishes Sharon  ",

I think about everyone here and how brave everyone is and how you all seem to be getting on with your lives. One problem I have is that I keep remembering my lumpectomy operation 5 years ago. I nearly didn't make that operation. I got to the operating theatre with no medication and decided that I wouldn't both and was half off the bed and trying to go. All of the theatre staff came out and my consultant tried to persuade me to stay. Someone said quickly drink this and then a mask was put on me and I was gone. It is so vivid in my mind that I can't see how I am going to be able to do it again. This time it feels worse because it is a mastectomy. I still have the same consultant and he knows I found it hard, but when it comes down to it, it is me that has to do it.  All day today I kept thinking if it was next Monday then this could be happening or that could have happened and then I just start crying. It still seems that the easiest thing is to cancel it and just take my chances. My mind is in a turmoil and I can't concentrate on one thing. I was trying to do about five things at once this morning. Now I have completely exhausted myself I thought I would read the posts. I have thought about seeing my Gp, but time seems to be running out. Thank you again for your advice Best wishes Sharon",

It was comforting to read that after the operation you were less tearful than before. I guess it is a little bit to do with going into the unknown. I can see that the verse you quoted was very apt.

On Sunday I could forget all about things as an elderly neighbour had a fall in the garden and my husband and I rushed to help. I got towels to staunch the bleeding and waited for the ambulance. I was cleaning up for her and she said that I had enough to worry about without her. I just find times like that much easier because it isn't to do with yourself.  I guess this is where the keeping busy and having positives like your daughter getting married are a help. It is when I have time to think that it all goes wrong. Sorry to hear about your daughter and depression. Hope all goes well. Best wishes Sharon",

      "Content": "Hi Janet           Thank you for your reply. I think you are right when you talk about choosing the right option and not the easiest. I think I am trying to take the easiest option, because I have previously had a lumpectomy on the other breast I know I coped with that. The scar was ok but as it is at the top of the breast I never wore anything that revealed any part of my chest agian, because the scar would be seen. I always wear t shirts that cover it up. I was left with a bad body image and although I am only 6stone in weight constantly worry about my size and shape. If Ihave the mastectomy I just don't know how I will cope with looking at my body. That's why I was asking about numbness and washing/showering etc. Depression doesn't help with thoughts about myself, it's not because I'm vain or anything, just the complete opposite. When I hear all of your stories I just think about the bravery you all show in the face of adversity. I just hope that some of it will rub off on me. All the best Sharon",

It is a strange coincidence when talking to people as my husband used to play cricket and I did the scoring for his matches. I try to keep positive when I have read things here,but then all the negativity starts and I keep thinking I only have a few days left before I have changed for ever. I keep imagining what I will look like and what it would be like to see myself in a mirror when washing. It just makes me feel sick and then I think I can't go through with it.

I should have had my mastectomy on Monday, but instead I had a massive panic attack and was unable to have the operation. I was running and jumping with my heart pounding and crying a lot. I got to the  5th floor  and could go no further. I sat on the window sill and shook and cried and gasped for breath. I sat there for nearly an hour and then my consultant arrived for work. He saw me and took me by the hand and said come up with me. I managed to get to the 7th floor and was shown my little room. He sat with me for a long time and talked about if it was the best choice for me. I kept thinking that I should be doing it, but I couldn't seem to make myself say yes. He got the nurse to come so that he could get on with the first operation and he said he would see me later. To cut a long story short, I stayed there all day debating the best course of action. It was thought that the lumpectomy and calcification removal might be better for my mental health. I am thus going to try again on 29th Nov as a day patient. I feel that  I let everyone down who has tried to help me and I am sorry for that. I hope that the rest of you going through this are stronger than I was. Best wishes everyone Sharon",
