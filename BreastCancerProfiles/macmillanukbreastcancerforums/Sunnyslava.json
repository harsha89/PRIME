    "Content": "Hi, I can imagine how you feel, this is quite daunting. All I can say, it will be ok and not as scary as it may look now. I have been through 15 cycles of chemo and actually - this was not as bad as I thought. I did go for the cold cap and didn\u2019t regret it for a second. Keeping my hair was very important to me, and even though I did lose quite a lot, I managed to keep a lot, and my hair grew back very quickly (after the end EC and whilst still on Taxol).  If you do decide to go for it, here are a couple of tips: 1) the cap is painful so do take the painkillers, and take them at least 30 min before the cap goes on. Make sure you eat well before so that the painkillers work. It\u2019s unlikely that you would be able to eat during the process. 2) Also make sure that it fits very tightly, this is the only way it is going to work. You have to feel it all around your head. The hair I did lose was the result of the cold cap not touching the top of my head on the very first time when I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.  If you can, ask to try several caps. My unit had 3 different ones (different coloit\u2019s) to suit different head shapes.3) the first 10 minutes you will feel your head freezing which us quite uncomfortable, but then you get used to it. Try to persevere and trust it will get better. I was able to read and watch TV and that helped me and distracted from what was going on.  4)finally if you absolutely hate it, don\u2019t kill yoursef. There are lots of nice wigs and ways to conceal the loss of hair, and still look nice, and it will grow back eventually any way. This is all hard enough. Sending you all the positive vibes and hope it helps!",
