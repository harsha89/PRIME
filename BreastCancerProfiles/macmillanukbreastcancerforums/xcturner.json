      "Content": "everything you have said is right. I am acting negative, and you are right what hope does my sister have if im already thinking of the worst outcome I dont tell my sister i think all of this hence coming online but myself and my mom are negative when together - i will try to be more positive until Monday. the doctors have let us down because they did an initial scan some time ago on the Lympthnodes and said that it hadnt spread, then we were told that was a mistake and it HAD. they removed some of them whilst doing her first op with removal of tumour, they then  found they were infected so now removed them all. we were supposed to get the results of that and still havnt.. we are in the dark about exactly what stage this is theyve found something also in her lung, which they said they were less concerned about. shes had a biopsy on her neck, and a bone xray but we have never had any set stage - we have no idea my sister said her cancer is hormone based, she recieved fertility treatment almost 5 years ago that she fears is linked thank you",

      "Content": "Hi Lesley, i meant to respond to you sooner - i even told my mom and sister about you! and how youd helped me. on Monday, i woke up getting ready thinking this will be the last day before our worlds turn even more upside down and we may be given a time frame on my sisters life. i left work early to go pick up my nephews from reception/nursery. i was in the middle of the shop like a zombie, when i got that call from my mom i felt sick and was shaking. my mom handed the phone to my sister who told me the scans were not cancer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we have finally had the positive news we had hoped for, i burst out crying in the shop ended up spending 12 pound on my nephews saying they could have what they wanted, i must of looked like a mad woman i was just so relieved. she needs chemo for 6months, 3 months aggressive to start. i just want to thank you so so much for supporting me, and you were right about it all and i should have listened. i cant believe how different things are now to then, and we can now try and think of the future. its still a hard journey but its defo not the end. love to you and thank you, i shall stay in touch along the way x",

      "Content": "hi i dont get chance to go to the appointments as i babysit her children while she goes as we want to keep them as seperate to the hospital as possible. she has breast cancer which we believed was caught early but recent signs suggest it could actually  be stage 4.. we have had such mixed answers, at one point we were told the lythnodes were clear then told that was false. shes had all lythnodes removed from the one side and 3 lumps from her left breast theyve now done a scan and seen 'something' on her spine and neck.. this is where my concern for stage 4 steps in she had the further bone scan yesterday.. results monday my mom and i spoke about this last night and how much our worlds have turned around and we need to be prepared for a bad outcome .. things will never ever be the same again and im really struggling to cope with that x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone  my older sister is 30 - a single mother to two children (4 yo and 2yo) she found a lump and was diagnosed with breast cancer just two weeks before her 30th birthday in July. i was positive at the start, obviously very upset but confident she was young and shes so brave and strong she would fight this. however it has now been 4 months since she was diagnosed and all we have had is bad news. my sister has had a reduction in one side as 3 lumps were found in her left breast. she has also now had lypthnodes removed from her armpit. still though, 4 months on and no treatment heres the big one... they finally did a body scan which has shown something on her spine. we dont know exactly what yet. however i have done so much research until i am blue in the face and not sure i can cry anymore to find out that once cancer is in the spine - thats kind of the worst outcome.  as a family we are destraught, you honestly never think itll be you.   has anyone got any advice what so ever on what it could be on the spine? I am 99.9percent sure its the cancer spreading i suppose i just wanted to come on here for some sort of support   my sisters further bone scan is thursday and her results monday i cry none stop and i feel sick does anyone have a similar story? to have such advanced problems at such a young age? Frustratingly my sister is the healthiest person i know however she underwent fertility treatment nearly 5 years ago thank you",
