      "Content": "Crystaljuju Hi Jonathan15  That's quite an obvious swelling. I'm guessing it wasn't there when you went to the consultant?  How long ago did you get seen? Such an obvious swelling is more than likely to be a cyst or to do with sweat glands.  You really do need to get that checked out but not because I think it's cancer but obviously something is wrong. All the best Julia  Thanks for fast reply , this forum is really best , swelling is obvious but can it be due to my shoulder joint swelling or something like that because I do physical examination of my self every month since  I started developing little gynecomastia , so I check my rbeast for lump etc , I think it is possible that I may have pressed too much on my underarm which have caused swelling , Evaluate the pic that you find swelling in right armpit , or it is same like left armpit? ",

      "Content": "mistymoley Hi Jonathan15  I agree with Julia, you obviously do have a lump and the only way to establish what it might be, is via a biopsy or scan.  Get back to your consultant and ask for the lump to be checked properly.  We aren't able to give medical advice, because we are not medically trained, but you can call the nurses on the helpline 0808 808 0000. they will be open at 9am on Monday until 8pm, and every weekday.   Good luck and do let us know how you get on. Thanks , I will get that checked soon , but lump is more hard and fixed I think , and this stuff is on my skin with more like muscles in it and is very soft although my whole skin is soft like old guy so I doubt it , still in worries , can u tell what u judged from the photo I sent?",

This word lumps kills me from inside because I already have mild gynecomastia and when I hear lump its definitely gonna be breast cancer (male) , are u sure it sounds lump to you ?",

All the best Julia  I went to doctor 10 days ago ,  and only I can barely notice this when I pull my armpits and move my naked eyes left and right then I feel that right one is little more bulging than left , there is no pain , tenderness or anything , it is more like muscles/fat to me than the hardbody/lump . ",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply , but its not bothering me , I just had very little unnoticeable gynecomastia and puffy nipples since last year , so I started to examine my breast /under arm area once every month , its not fixed/hard like a typical lump ! but it is more on skin than inside , I assume that lump should be inside not like this it is more like mass of muscles when I press it I feel random muscles in it and what caused to notice this is that there is difference in physical look of my both armpits , my left armpit is not like right right as you can see in the photo. My Doctor just examined my breasts not underarm and he said breasts are okay .",

      "Content": "Thanks , I have uploaded new pic of today , this stuff in my underarm is barely noticeable by me the doctor won't notice it even if I convince him , because I can see this when I move my eyes 180degree lateral to see my armpits side view than I realize that yes this right one is littlemore bulging than the left armpit , this is of my concern here , its more like muscular strips than hardbody/lump/fixed mass , God knows better but I am really now fed up of all this seriously , first I had twice inguinal hernia repair , than suddenly I had little gynecomastia last year and now this stuff . Thanks for reply god bless you all . new photo link : http://imgur.com/a/gla0B",
