      "Content": "hiya....i m deb and live in wigan.   i had boob off in may l0 and they removed l6 nodes...and the cancer had gone into one.  they say anything under 3 nodes affected is good news.. i still had to have chemo which was hard but you get through it...had my last session on christmas eve... im feeling fitter now and am getting around and out and about .  i am having radiotherapy in a few weeks time.... which i think will be easier than the chemo...  i think clair that you must be coping already cos you are on here a day after the op which is great... the waiting time for your results is pretty shit but just focus on getting yourself strong from the op first.   good luck with the results. dont worry too much it will all be ok..xxxxxxx",
