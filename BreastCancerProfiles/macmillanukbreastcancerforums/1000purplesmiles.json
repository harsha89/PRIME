    "Content": "I too have been using the cold cap, I am coming to end of six cycles of weekly chemo.. My hair is still half way down my back. It is a lot thinner, but still there. No-one massaged my feet whilst using it (:-() but I still managed. I would say that the first twenty mins are horrid and then it is ok. I was given mostly negative feedback by the staff,in terms of being able to put up with it and its effectivnes, but I found it to be bearable and worth it. I say, if in doubt, give it a try. Bon courage.",
