      "Content": "Hi Violet25 I agree with what others have said, definitely don\u2019t feel a failure for not working, everyone is different and we have to do what is best for us.  Especially  in your case if you need to stay off for safety reasons and your company are happier with you staying off. Hopefully as you move into the second week after your 1st FEC, at the end of this week, you will start to feel a bit better again... until the next one! Like you say it\u2019s nice to know there are others who are not working too.   Hi Karen, Thanks for getting back to me about working, great that you didn\u2019t get too much in the way of side effects, really impressive that the only time you had off was 2 weeks for surgery and chemo days. Each time I felt better after surgery I then ended up going back for more so didn\u2019t get back to work. I work with children and although going back has been on my mind I am worried about picking up an infection and it isn\u2019t really possible to take things at a slower pace, so I really not sure if I would manage it. I hope I too don\u2019t get too many side effects on T, I am a bit wary about starting that next month.",

      "Content": "Hi, this is my first post.  I am 48, I was diagnosed just before Christmas.  I had a lumpectomy, then re-excision and then mastectomy.  I started my chemo in April.  I am having 6 cycles of FECT.  I will have my third FEC treatment on Saturday Morning, I will then be moving onto Doxetaxel and Herceptin for cycle 4 later in June.  I haven't had a chance to meet with or chat with anyone else going through the same thing so was pleased to have found this group.",

      "Content": "Thank you Ladies for such a warm welcome to the site! There is a Maggie\u2019s in Oxford which is not too far from me, although I have only had a chance to visit once so far. The FEC has been going ok I have not felt too bad and the side effect although not pleasant have all been manageable. Last time my bloods were a bit low so it was touch and go if it would go ahead \u2013 luckily when they retested they had risen enough. I am hoping blood will be OK this weekend for FEC 3.  Looking forward to getting last FEC out of the way but a bit apprehensive about starting the Docetaxol next month. Just wondered if many people are working through chemo and how they have found that? I have been off of work since my first surgery in January. Thanks again for the hugs, tips (& lyrical trip down memory lane!). I look forward to hanging out on here from time to time.",
