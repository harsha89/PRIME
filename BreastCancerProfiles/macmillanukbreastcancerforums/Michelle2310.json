    "Content": "Hi flower, I am only on this site as my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of days before Xmas. Regarding the drinking- try ice tea, my mum drinks it by the gallons- even make ice cubes out of any of your drinks. Start using mouth wash, ask your doctor for it ASAP, don't wait for the ulcers to come,my mum got them and was in so much pain. Before your chemo session, eat something, like a cake- I always get my mum to eat before her session, it helps her. The tiredness, sleep when ever you feel you need to, I could be in full conversation with my mum then suddenly she would be snoring!! Hair loss, my mum started to lose her hair on the 15th day after her first chemo, she was shocked, upset and angry. She now has a wig and I swear on my heart you cannot tell its a wig. She got hers from the royal Marsden hospital. You are feeling low so ask the hospital to transfer you to talk to someone, I done this for my mum- she is now going through that stage of \"why me , I have never been Illin my life\" she is angry at the world and it's so sad seeing her likes this- please talk to someone- it will help. I am so sorry about the baby, my heart goes out to you xxx I WISH YOU A SPEADY RECOVERY :) Regards Michelle xxxxx",
