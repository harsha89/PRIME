      "Content": "Hi SheppyÂ  I was diagnosed on 18th April following a mammogram- I had no symptoms and to be honest I\u2019m still in shock. Like you I\u2019m keeping a brave face on the surface - I have my first consultant appointment on Monday and then hopefully my operation date after that. Only after the op will I know what I\u2019m dealing with. I too feel quite alone and absolutely terrified. I can\u2019t face anyone either. The waiting and not knowing is awful. My cat who is usually quite aloof now follows me around the house and sleeps on the bed next to me! He never does that!! As I\u2019m new here I can\u2019t offer you advice at the moment - just know you aren\u2019t alone x everyone here is very supportive. Keep your chin up xx",

I\u2019ve downloaded a Meditation app called Calm. Going to give that a go to see if I can try and relax!!",
