    "Content": "Hiya Jazzcat. I have had 2 occy health assessments. The first one.. I was to return to work during chemo but a week later the chemo had caused a blood clot which involved further surgery. Last week I had my second occy health assessment. I work for the local council and they use independant occy health assessors. The assessor has been extremely supportive. That is the roll of occy health. They will support you and be there if you find it all to much and need to talk to somebody. It is a very positive experience so please son't worry about the outcomes. I wanted to go back full time but they have recommended a phased return to make sure I am ok with it. I am glad you have the opportunity to be assessed by occy health as I have heard of people having to return to work inappropriately. Hope you feel this has helped and all the best. Anne. X",
