      "Content": "Hello there!! I agree with what you have mentioned every human being is unique its just a matter of decision making. I will be having my mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in two weeks time but unlike yiu just had my chemotheraphy first. Maybe the doctors thinks about it if they will have my surgery before. The chemotehraphy is attacking even the good cells thats why they make the healing process slower but you can do it they can manage it. Just had 16 chemo 4 AC and 12 taxol. I know you can make it too.    loren xx",

During those times that you feel weak just think of the good things and keep smiling.    During my first chemo i feel nauseated but there is medicine for evrything just drink more fluid and eat a balanced diet",

Maybe she's angry with the world that she's throwing it all on you. Just remember all the good times you've been together. And remember being in the relationship is not only for good times but also for bad times.Have more patience  give her some space . But stay with her she needed you!!! Its the time that she need somebody to cheer her up!!!! Be strong be man enough for her.    Thnx Loren    ",
