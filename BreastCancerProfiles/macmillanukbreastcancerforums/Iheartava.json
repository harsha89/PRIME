      "Content": "Hi to all, my name is Gemma I'm 33 and a mother to four children, all under the age of 7... I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice/personal experience- of being diagnosed with breast cancer after finding a lump in an armpit. I have had a lump in my armpit for a very long time, probably longer than I care to admit... I sometimes felt it was there, and sometimes I wondered if it was a figment of my imagination... It's pretty much painless, but I started to notice it more recently, I made a doctors appiontment, and she confirmed it was a swollen lymph node roughly around 3cm in circumference. I am otherwise completely healthy. Thank you for your time, Gemma. ",

      "Content": "Thanks for your responses guys, yes I have been referred under a two week waiting time, so I'm hoping for an appointment letter next week, my doctor has asked that I have a mammogram, scan, and possible biopsy... I do have a family history of cancer, but not breast cancer. I have other symptoms from the enlarged lymph node, such as discomfort in my arm, and sometimes pain in my arm and general stiffness.. so I'm guessing from this, it is a enlarged lymph node.. I also have pain around my breast bone... did anyone experience any of these symtoms? Thank you greatly for your advice. Gemma ",
