      "Content": "Hi to you all. Finally found time and courage to communicate on here. DCIS was discovered at routine mammogram in May. I had wide excision and biopsy showed spread so then sentinel node biopsy (June/July) Now on tamoxifen and finished 18 sessions of radiotherapy on Monday. I just wanted to ask when will I start to feel better? So tired, have sinus infection (I think) hot flushes, not sleeping well and quite emo! I have to see occupational health next week about return date to work and don't want to be a malingerer but really don't think I could manage yet. I'm a full time FE teacher. Anyone in similar circumstances?",

It is very lonely dealing with all of this, your understanding means a lot. I think I can relax a little and ignore the pressures, for now! Maybe I should take your advice Denzil, it made me laugh! I appreciate your kind words and wish you all the very best, thanks x",

      "Content": "Well, I had my occupational health meeting yesterday, what on earth was I stressing about! Very relieved to tell you that he was more than supportive, in fact he couldn't understand why I was even there one week after radiotherapy! His report says that he doesn't even want to see me to discuss return to work/adjustment etc for at least 6 weeks. He advised me, same as you all have to forget about work and focus on getting myself better. At least now I feel I have a bit of breathing space to get my head around all this. Thanks again for all your support, take care x",

      "Content": "Hello mistymoley, thank you for your support. I haven't found my work to be very supportive, a colleague has had cancer which has returned several times over the past few years, his opinion is that radiotherapy is easy, 'wee buns' and he is very quick to return to work, but then he is a manager and as such can avoid teaching duties and doesn't have timetable to stick to. This is causing me a lot of stress, but then I'm on an emotional roller coaster at the moment. It really helps to have another perspective, thank you, I think you are right x",
