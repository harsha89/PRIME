      "Content": "That's just crap Daphne, Im so sorry to hear that.  Just to tell you a bit about my experience which may help.  I was first diagnosed in 2000 with grade 1, had lumpectomy, was ok for 13 years, then had another primary grade 2 and DCIS  in 2012 and had a mastectomy and immediate recon using strattice and implant.  At the time I requested a bilateral as I didn't want to go through again that it might return but didn't because it would have delayed my op and I just wanted it over and done with.  Three years on I regret that decision.  I am on hormone therapy which has awful side effects and my quality of life is compromised as a result.  Had I persevered with my wish for a bilateral I could have avoided the meds, had two matching boobs and less worry about the cancer returning.  One thing that isn't often mentioned is that although Ive since had a reduction of the other breast to 'match', as you age one stays pert, the other droops, so I now have a very mismatched pair!   Sorry, no more subtle way to put that...... Only you can make the decision of whats best for you, but its so hard to have to make such an important one when your brains full of confusion, anger and chaos.   I must admit I went from one decision to another almost at five min intervals and ended up deciding on the spot in the consultants room what my final choice was.   Good luck and all the best",

If youre near a Maggie's Centre they offer a wonderful Stress and Relaxation course.   Have a look on their website - they also have a CD which is excellent and which may be available if you cant actually attend a course.   I cant praise Maggies highly enough.   If you're near a centre - go.   It can be hard to walk in, but youll feel so much better when you do.  ",

However, It was three weeks until my radiotherapy started so I went back to work. I worked for the first three weeks of radiotherapy - I didnt find it bad at all - I had an extra hour off to allow for travel time there and back. Time in the radiotherapy room is 10 minutes max! I stopped work at the end of the third week because I became very tired, had the 4th week off then went on a two week holiday and returned to work after that. So just three weeks off (I worked 4 days a week). However, everyones different. So listen to your body and do whats best for you. Carole x",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy (and everyone else who is having surgery soon) You've got some great advice and suggestions - I especially endorse the little cushion for under your armpit - it eases the pressure and is as much a comforter as anything else. However my bit of advice would be to be truthful and admit youre scared.   I was petrified to look at my scar and put it off for days.  When the time came to get the dressings off and have a shower I was in a right state but had the most understanding and sensitive of nurses who came into the bathroom with me and took off my dressings, turned me round and we looked in the mirror together.   It was done and the relief was indescribable.  Im crying writing about it now and it was two years ago!!   That was the start of my recovery and acceptance of what had happened to me. I hope your op goes well - I too had stage 2, mx with immediate recon and Im now well.   Good luck and, as we say in Scotland,  'Orrabest'",

      "Content": "Hi Julie Im sorry you've had such a crap time recently.  Its rotten too that at times when youre feeling unwell you have to make some pretty important decisions.  We all react differently to different drugs and its a fact that some drugs make you feel awful but help preserve your life.   I do think 3 weeks is too little time to give Tamoxifen.  In my case, I was prescribed it in 2000, the first few weeks were awful  - all the things you describe - but I went back to work, the side effects lessened and I continued to work for the five years I was on it with hardly any side effects (apart from weight gain which I now attribute as much to my own lack of exercise as the T.)   I was off it for 5 years then discharged from my annual checkups at the hospital, went for my first three-yearly routine breast screening and was diagnosed with another primary in 2012.   I was on Letrozole for two years (as I was now post menopausal)  - during which the side effects became much worse rather than better - and came off it four months ago to go back onto Tamoxifen.   For the first few weeks I had the same problems as you report, but theyre now lessening and Im hoping I have the same experience as before - ie that I take it for 5 years, but they don't interfere too much with my life. I know its hard and you have to make your own choice but in your shoes I would try for another few months and then decide.  Hope this helps but if you need any more info let me know - and good luck!

      "Content": "Hi Valerie-ann I was first diagnosed grade 1 bc 1999, took Tamoxifen for 5 years during which time I put on a stone.  As soon as I stopped after five years the weight just dropped off.   I was diagnosed again in 2012 with grade 2 and DCIS, had an mx and was prescribed letrozole which I put up with for 18 months but came off because of severe joint pain.  Again Ive put the stone back on, so I reckon that's evidence for it being the meds, not my lifestyle which hasn't really changed. I too walk every day.  As well as strengthening my bones, I find it improves my mood and I feel much more flexible and healthy.  I joined a walking group and walk with them about 5 miles once a week and have made many great new friends who are now a part of my 'new' life since retirement!   I also walk every day for a minimum of 30 minutes.   Ive just read an article that people who walk every day live significantly longer than those who don't so theres the motivation.   So my advice is to keep moving and hopefully youll see a difference.

Im 4.5 months post mx and reconstruction and strangely now that the active treatment is over Im feeling really quite down, having been so 'strong' - whatever tht really is. I think its not having the constant security of regularly going to the hospital. My next appt is in June for followup. So I would like to meet up for the monthly lunch in Edinburgh if possible. And yes, this is such a great facility - I dont often post but I do often browse and gain great comfort from posts from all the wonderful, wise and encouraging women on this site. So thank you all !

      "Content": "Hi Tracey I agree with other posts but want to address your feelings of being lonely and emotional.   Like you I felt 'lucky' in that I didn't need chemo I 'only' had a mastectomy and chose to have an implant.   How we downplay what's happened to us!   Its so much harder to recover from the emotional impact of this diagnosis and treatment.  Its hard to keep wearing a mask to convince folk we're ok when inside we're most definitely not.   I found face to face conversations with folk who had been through a similar experience to be the solution for me, guided by experienced facilitators.  Are you near a Maggies Centre?   I recently attended a 'Where Now' course there (half day a week for six weeks) and It has been life-changing for me.  Before I was an emotional wreck, was frightened to go out as I burst into tears if anyone so much as spoke to me, and felt so anxious all the time.   Im much more calm and relaxed now, feel more in control and confident and am sleeping so much better.   Im still in touch with the women (and one man) who were on the course and feel so supported by folk who really do know what its like.  No masks required.   Breast Cancer Care runs a similar course called 'Moving Forward' I think (on their website).   Both look at how to move forward after cancer treatment and also reassure us that its unrealistic to be 'back to normal' after 6-8 weeks.    The truth is life cannot go back to what it was before a cancer diagnosis, - you cant rub it out.  But it can still be wonderful and it gave me the opportunity to re-evaluate my life and my relationships, what's important to me and what makes me happy - and ditch the crap!   Hope this helps and all the very best.",

Also, if I have the reduction too a plastic surgeon is involved, but if just (did I say JUST?!) the mx and recon it seems as if its a breast onc surgeon. Should I insist on a plastic surgeon or does the breast surgeon do as good a job?

Does it settle down over time? Im thinking of having a reduction on my other side as I am so lopsided with a pert boob on one side and a droopy one on the other.

Also suffer from stiffness and joint pain but thought that was perhaps because Ive not been so active since my op.

      "Content": "Hi   Just to add to your comments, I attended a Stress and Relaxation 6-week course at Maggies.  There were 8 people in the group, with different cancers and at different stages.  The two facilitators were wonderful and used mindfulness throughout and I cant explain the difference this course made to my wellbeing.  My anxiety reduced significantly and I was able to sleep for a whole night for the first time in months and continue to do so.   Even my blood pressure improved!   Having a cancer diagnosis is such an emotional rollercoaster - I stopped going out as I couldn't trust myself not to burst out crying if I had to speak to someone - but being able to offload all that stuff (whilst giving family and friends a break) was such a release. I also discovered that the Macmillan Centre at my hospital offer free massages (donations are welcome) and I have had one which was sheer bliss.  I left feeling much calmer and lighter.  I am looking forward to my next one later this month.   So I would encourage anyone to seek out these centres and nourish your mind as well as your body.   Sermon over!   All the best. ",
