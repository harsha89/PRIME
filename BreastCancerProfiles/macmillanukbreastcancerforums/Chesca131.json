      "Content": "Hello all.. What do I say... If I close my eyes does it all go away...? I had a mastectomy just over 2 weeks ago and thought I would have some radio therapy..but the Gods of Carnage have other ideas... Chemo another op and finally radio...that's if the mri results on my uterus and ovaries don't come back with too much of a problem. I've been ok up to now...bit of arthritis but no meds ..pretty fit and healthy...or so I thought.. How is it that parts of your body that have been fine just go rogue on you... ? I've got my first grand child on the way.(My step daughter).. My business is doing well,my beautiful girl is finally finding some equilibrium and I'm respected and sought after as an am dram actor!Â  It stinks",
