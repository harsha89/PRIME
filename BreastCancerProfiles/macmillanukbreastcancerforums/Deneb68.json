    "Content": "Hi Tracey, Glad you are getting on OK with the Tax. I'm looking forward to my third and LAST this Wednesday....Hurray!! Its been pretty kind to me actually - 2nd was better than the first and hoping that the 3rd will be milder still - but it will be nice to get my taste buds back..... I wouldn't mind so much but my sense of smell and my sense of imagination are still fine - so I look at a bowl of chocolate ice cream and imagine the deliciousness....and then when I taste it its like rubbing lard around my mouth!! Hey ho - will be lovely to get it done though - and then just the radio to go!! Wendy and Lindsey - hope the side effects become a little better for you both. Much love to all Paulax",
