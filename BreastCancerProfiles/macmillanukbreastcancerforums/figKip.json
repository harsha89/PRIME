      "Content": "Hello everyone, Still no results! My initial sample failed to produce a result when tested 3x so a new sample was sent to the lab, these results are STILL not back so I\u2019ve been waiting a really long time now... they may arrive this week (week 3 of waiting for 2nd time) the chances are my sample won\u2019t produce ANY result so they have said they will treat it as HER2 negative. This really worries me!!! If it\u2019s unknown I may not be getting the right treatment (chemo & herceptin) my onco was quite matter of fact about this but I\u2019m a bit scared. Has anyone else had an inconclusive test?!!! Thank you xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone  Has anyone else had a FISH test for HER2 that comes back with no result?  I\u2019ve been waiting for these results since Jan 9th and on Monday I was rung by admin @breast clinic to say \u2018good news it\u2019s negative\u2019 only to be told later that day when meeting the radio/onco consultant that it was not negative at all, there was no result and whoever rang me made a mistake!! My sample was tested 3x and pathology report says the sample was unsuitable to get a result. A new sample was sent this week from the lump removed in surgery but I\u2019m going slightly crazy... another 2 weeks wait...  If this sample doesn\u2019t work - i\u2019ll be left not knowing if I\u2019m HER2+ Or not and that makes me anxious - I really don\u2019t want chemo but not knowing if I should have had it or not seems barmy... now I\u2019m really mistrustful of the test, the result and who tells me what... Waaaaaa! The wait is really getting to me! I have a 5 yr old little boy who keeps you in the moment but it\u2019ll be almost 6 weeks of no results soon!  Thanks for any insights or experiences x",

My 1st visit (for tattoos) was quite upsetting as I was wondering what was wrong with everyone else rather than me and everyone looked very subdued and i felt quite sad.

I have my ct scan tomorrow (bit nervous - can anyone talk me through it?) and had no guidance /leaflets about radio yet - do they do that at the ct scan? My first appointment to talk about RT is 25mins before my first zap so I want to be sure I\u2019m well prepared!!  No deodorant and wash thoroughly with simple soap beforehand - no creams - is that everything?!  Thanks you lot, wonder if we glow in the dark once finished I have 20 sessions 5 of those are boosts.... High fives to you all xx",

Maybe they\u2019ll fade in a few years!  I never did get my FISH result - onco about to call it a failed test & accept biopsy result of HER2 negative. My onco says nothing else to try as I don\u2019t meet NICE regs for oncotype / endopredict test on NHS - I could self-fund but it\u2019s£2.5k!!!!! feel really wobbly about this as chemo may have been helpful but I\u2019ll never know... can\u2019t afford that fee! Also if I\u2019m going to do that I\u2019ll have to pull the RT as chemo needs to go first... I think I\u2019m just going to go for RT / Tamox and hope for the best... feel very weird & quite tearful today... Kate x",

Insomnia nuts - even taking tab at breakfast hasn\u2019t helped (trying melatonin now). Nausea seems to be bad for 2/3 days a week or so after my period - it seems to coincide with ovulation which may make sense as that\u2019s normally when you\u2019d get a spike in oestrogen...  No hot flushes yet, () had 2 cold chills tho, they were nasty!! Nothing would warm me up. Weird stuff eh? Fatigue intermittently catches me out, some days I\u2019m whacked / again looks linked to hormonal cycle. Other than that I\u2019m back to work very soon and pretty much ok with occasional emotional wobbles! Hope you\u2019re ok! Kate x",
