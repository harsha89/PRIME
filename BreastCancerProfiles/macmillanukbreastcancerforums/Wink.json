      "Content": "Hi LiziX, Sorry that you find yourself here, but it is great place for support and information.  Join in on the April Chemo thread, some lovely people there discussing the practicalities of chemo and what it is really like. I start my chemo this Friday and am dreading it, but feel like I have to gather up my strength and just push through. Everything seems to have happened very fast for you, hope you have some quiet moments to think and try and get your head around things. Sending you a hug. Xx",

      "Content": "Can\u2019t tag for some reason...chemo in general is going ok, Jammy. I have the usual SE\u2019s for 6 or so days post treatment, tired, mild nausea (relieved well by medication), horrible taste issues and headaches. After those days pass, the rest of my cycle is close to normal. I\u2019m finding the mental bit of it all more of a challenge though, easy to be happy and distracted when kids are around but have lots of wake up and worry in the night moments and times when it feels like climbing a mountain with no summit in sight. I am a big list and plan maker and BC makes me feel a bit like I can\u2019t control anything (or maybe to realise that I never could despite my best efforts!). Anyway, it does feel good to reach chemo 3 this week and to appreciate that in general I am feeling really well.  I am sending you a long distance hug for your last chemo! What a milestone. Do they have a bell? I would ring it off the hook if they do  Hope everyone else is doing well this week. Xx",

      "Content": "Maggiemee, thanks for your reply Put a smile on my face....you have a great outlook. It\u2019s very true, we are lucky to have the treatments and I do get comfort from telling myself that the chemo is working to help me have a healthy future.  I had a really good day yesterday, had lunch out with my work friends. Loubag, I am off work completely as well...am an A+E/crit care nurse and couldn\u2019t commit to being at work unless I felt 100%. I do miss work, and also feel a bit like you in that I feel bad for my OH now being sole earner until this passes. It was so much fun to see my work mates yesterday...sun was shining and we had a glass of wine and beautiful food with lots of laughs. I have seen two of my closest friends regularly from work, but was a bit nervous about seeing everyone in my new state. I got a bit creative with my scarf and dressed up a bit (have been living in comfy clothes). Felt great, felt like me.  Anyhow, off to the city now for chemo number 3 tomorrow. Wishing everyone a good week. Xx",

      "Content": "Thanks Dormouse and ask123 It has all just come on so quickly, it\u2019s surprising! I am just about to have my third round of TAC chemo. My oncologist did talk about periods stopping, maybe forever (I am 42), but we didn\u2019t talk about the other symptoms. Now that I have done some reading it seems very common during chemo. I remember my mum saying that she had a terrible time for a few years with hot flashes and moods, wish she was still here to commiserate.  Last night was a bit better as I layered before bed for easy shedding when the inferno hit! It was also very cold overnight here so throwing open the window at 2am helped...don\u2019t think my OH enjoyed that though....",

I will be starting chemo next Friday the 13th, hoping to join you all for some support and chat. Reading through here has really helped me to get my head around this breast cancer diagnosis, so thank you I\u2019m 42, living in Australia. I have had two WLE surgeries in the last 3 weeks for IDC grade 3 and DCIS..unfortunately margins still not clear of DCIS so will have mastectomy after chemo.  I have two young kids 7 and 9 who have kept me happy and distracted, but have my wobbles when I feel very scared.  I will be having TAC chemo regimen...has anyone out there had this one?",

How frustrating Annie Ealing...hoping that this cycle is different for you and that Day 8 comes and goes without incident. I am Day 6 of first TAC cycle and feeling a bit better this morning after a few low days. I have an appointment to get my hair cut today, can\u2019t come soon enough as I have noticed a lot more shedding in the brush this morning.  Healthy vibes to everyone this week x",
