      "Content": "Hi Wendi and Dani Thanks for recounting your experiences, I actually feel quite guilty moaning about my drain now. Mine drains into a plastic vacuum bulb which is drained off into a plastic measuring bag when it gets full. I used to do that bit myself at first as there was too much for one bulb full and the nurses would then measure what was in the bag each day. Now that I'm not producing so much fluid I just leave it to the nurse. I was give a cotton drawstring bag by the hospital before I left to keep the bulb and measuring bag in which the ward sister attached to a length of bandage across my body like a handbag so I could be hands free. The district nurses have come in every morning between 9am and 11am to change the measuring bag and to check up on my wound. So I really have had it easy as all I have is the inconvenience of carrying the damn thing around.  Wendi yours sounds horrendous, my drain bag feels heavy enough each morning and I then pin it to my top to take some of the weight off. Having to go several days without having it changed would be a nightmare. And to think you were in hospital longer than normal, you would think the district nurses would make a special point of visiting you daily. It just shows how much the care varies up and down the country. I'm being treated at Llandough Breast Centre near Cardiff and the care I've received throughout has been fantastic.  And Dani, thanks for letting me know you've had yours in 19 days and that the extra fluid doesnt mean anything, that really does reassure me that I am not abnormal. I hope you managed to get rid of that last drain yesterday.  Best wishes Trina",

      "Content": "Thanks for your quick replies Rebecca and Louise.  It's reassuring to know you had one of yours for 2 weeks Rebecca and I too prefer to keep it there rather than have it build up under the wound. That's the one thing that consoles me about having it so long is that at least it's getting rid of all the fluid.  My BC nurse is on holiday this week Louise which is why I didnt ring her. I'm going to clinic on Thursday though as I mentioned, for the results of the lab tests on the breast they removed and to see whether I need the lymph nodes removed or not, so I can ask my consultant then. I'm sure he'll have a very good explanation.  It just seemed to me to be such a long time to keep them in compared to the usual stuff I've read online.  Thank you again both Trina",

      "Content": "Hi guys I've just joined the site, although I must admit I've been reading the articles on this discussion board for a few weeks. It seems as though everyone on here is really helpful and it's good to share your thoughts with others who have experienced the same.  I've had rather a whirlwind pathway since being diagnosed with a cancerous tumour in my right breast on June 6th. I had to have a full mastectomy with Sentinel Node biopsy on July 3rd and I opted for no reconstruction. Since being discharged from hospital a day later, the District Nurse comes each day to check up on me and measure the fluid in my wound drain.  It's now 12 days since the op and the discharge is back up to 120ml today (it was 100ml yesterday) so it looks as though I will still have it in when I go back to clinic for my follow up on Thursday. Has anyone else had to have their drains in for so long? I thought the norm was about a week.  Sorry this is so long-winded for a first post but I'm getting worried it's going to be really difficult to get it out, quite apart from the nuisance of carting it around everywhere.  many thanks Trina",
