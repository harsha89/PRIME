      "Content": "Hi everyone! I was diagnosed end March....have had neo adjuvant chemo  Fec-T  6 rounds and am awaiting lumpectomy on the 2nd September .....the oncologist is really happy as the lump which was 2.2cm is not palpable anymore.... me I spend my time worrying because it was really close to the chest wall, so I imagine it spreading, and because my veins now have phlebitis so there won't be a vein for the operation.....but mostly because I read such negative stuff about Tnbc.....can anyone have some patience and give me some positiveity! Much love to all !    Jackie ",

It's just so encouraging to hear from ladies who have been through it....you're words are uplifting....very very much so!!!  Crystaljuju are you Jackie too....I took your advice and went for a drive today and did some veggie shopping.....it helps to get out!!! You serious about the 100 percent ...who knows what stage...that's after op right?? Jj sailor....you will be fine through chemo! Just make sure you have time to rest rest rest....and eat super nutrient dense foods...as well as the odd crumpet....the only thing that tastes delicious in my opinion!! Monika thank you! It feels nice having someone say well done for finishing get, I must say I was lucky and didn't get some of the side effects I read about! I am in that online group....sometimes I find it uplifting....other times so sad when I read about recurrence and losing someone, esp when they're really young with babies....omg it sends me into a big big black hole ......thank you so much please keep in touch with me !

I am having a a lumpectomy as my oncologist and surgeon both insist it's enough, and I have to do radiation.  I asked specifically whether a mx gives me a better chance and they both said no!  It's all so confusing and horrible. I decided to go with what they are advising, although if they don't get clear margins then they will have to go back in. I pray to God they won't have to that!  I also want to get tested for braca.....my goodness I have to go on some waiting list and it can take up to 2 years, so am going to have to pay for it myself, and it not cheap, I'd so much rather go on a cruise!!!!  So is mum doing a double mx? I felt awful going through chemo, but 2 weeks out and I feel tired but ok, what about mum? How old is she? I'm 51.   This has hit me like badly, came out of nowhere and reading about tnbc is so depressing. I try not to but inevitably I do ........",

I wonder if it's going to be like this for the 2 remaining rounds? ! Also my urgh can't say the word (tumor) is close to the chest wall.......soooo I was wondering if there are any survivors with similar experiences who feel like giving me a ray of hope ......unless someone been through it it's hard to hear frieds telling you ooohhhh you're going to be fine whilst they're on thier way out to dinner of the gym........thanks and lots of love ",

I pray we won't ever have to go through chemo again!  I am sure I will feel very alone after radiation as I am triple negative so there's not targeted treatment for us .  Wonder if there's any other 'club' I can join for support!!??
