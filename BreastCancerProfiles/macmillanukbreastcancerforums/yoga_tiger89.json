    "Content": "Hello, I've never posted on one of these boards before (although I have been lurking for a few months...). My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer just over a month ago and is having her second breast lump excision and axillary clearance this Tuesday. Her diagnosis came as a shock to us. She first went to her GP back in March/April this year after finding a lump in her breast. Her diagnosis was delayed as when she was having a biopsy the needle ruptured a blood vessel (I believe) resulting in a haematoma i.e. a big internal/external bruise. This meant they were unable to see what they were dealing with. She then had to wait a further 8 weeks before she could have another biopsy, with an appointment in between where they couldn't do anything because she still had bruising. Finally she was told that the lump was mostly DCIS but with an area of invasive cancer. They had previously said it was probably just DCIS. I appreciate they can't say for sure until they've done all the tests, but this was still gutting to hear. They also said she would most likely only need radiotherapy and hormone treatment/tablets to follow up. She had a lump excision 6 weeks ago when they also found cancer cells in her lymph nodes (they took two out and one was affected). On Tuesday they will take a further margin of 1mm and will remove her lymph nodes at the same time. It hasn't been confirmed yet what treatment she will need to have, but we're assuming chemotherapy rather than radiotherapy. I know being diagnosed with any cancer probably takes a long time and is bound to be an extremely stressful time, but it really does feel like we've been on a rollercoaster! Every time she has an appointment there seems to be more bad news... I'm an only child - ok I'm nearly 30 - and I live at home with my mum and dad (saving like crazy to buy my first place). In some ways I'm glad I'm still at home right now to be able to support my parents. But at the same time it's hard as I'm with her most of the time and it feels overwhelming. I haven't been to any appointments with her so in some ways it doesn't feel real. My dad has been going with her but being the most squeamish person ever (he will faint at the mention of blood) he has struggled to sit through appointments and listen to what the consultant is saying. I'm planning to go to her next appointment with her. Luckily my employer is being very understanding and has said I can take time off/work from home whenever I need to. The first time I told her I broke down in tears and had to go home. I guess the point of my post is to reach out to anyone who is/has been in the same or similar situation. I suffer from anxiety/panic attacks and it has become worse recently as my mind keeps getting carried away and fearing the worst for my mum, so my GP has prescribed Citalopram which does seem to be helping. Obviously I don't want to make a big deal about it to my mum. As I said I've been able to confide in my line manager and a few close friends, but I don't want to \"burden\" them as everyone has problems and stuff to deal with in their lives.  My mum and I are super close - she's my best friend and we can talk about anything. But I still feel like she's bottling up her worries. She's lost some weight since being diagnosed as she said her appetite has gone but I can't help fearing this means the cancer is spreading - and I know she's thinking the same. I've tried to encourage her to speak to her designated Macmillan nurse and she has phoned her once and had some of her questions answered (she wanted to know what it said on the pathology report as she'd been to afraid/overwhelmed to ask the consultant). What I want to know is how I can be supportive and what I can do to help her? I'm so scared of losing her Thanks x",
