    "Content": "I'm just looking for a bit of advice really, was wondering if anyone else is experiencing what me and my family are going through. I have put this post on the emotional issues forum but think it's more suited here. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer in January and has since has a mastectomy and her lymph nodes removed. She is therefore supposedly 'cancer free' but is recieving chemo as a blast to make sure it's gone. Mum coped well with the first dose of FEC chemo but has not been the same since her 2nd. (4 weeks ago). It all started with very surreal dreams and hallucinations but has progressed into really fretful behaviour, she won't let my dad move for one minute then hates the sight of him the next. She worries that everyone can see in the house (there is no way) and that she will frighten people with her lack of hair. She is not letting herself fall asleep so is obviously majorly sleep deprived but I think there is more to this. I think losing her hair has been the tipping point (she is usually such a strong woman) and she's having a bit of a nervous breakdown. We have used the chemo red alert card and taken her to hospital 3 times but all they have done is check her bloods and give her scans (all clear) then they send her home for us to deal with the sleepless nights, silent treatment, following us around, fretting and shouting. One doctor mentioned a possibility of steroid psychosis but she has had no steroids in her system for 4 weeks now so I'm not sure if it's last that long. We think it is more of an emotional thing from having to deal with losing her breast then her hair. Her chemo doctor said there's no way we could have soemone for 24 hour support (not what we were looking for anyway) but did not give us any real advice for how to cope with the odd and upsetting behaviour. Has anyone else experienced this? I really just want my mum back.",
