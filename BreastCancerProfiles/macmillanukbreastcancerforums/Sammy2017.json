      "Content": "Hi.  Thank you do much for the responses. These were so reassuring.  I honestly felt I knew what streas was until I went through this and these weeks waiting have been horrible.   I went yesterday for my results and it is friberoma.  They are leaving it in and I need to monitor it.  This experience has opened up a new view on the world for me, and others in it.  The support which people have given and the caring naural nature you see from the nurses is overwhelming.  Im going to take this opportunity as a fresh start and not take things for granted xx",

      "Content": "Hi everyone.   I'm seaking some support and have been reading the stories on here but noticed there a few years out of date and was wondering how people got on? I started with what I thought where normal monthly pains , but they where consinstant in one breast. Over a little time my left breast got bigger and I could pin point to a circle where the pain was coming from. It started with an ich , then a burn and then went to the whole breast and under the arm. The pain would come and go.   I went to the docters and the GP couldn't feel any lumps. She said she's certain that it hormonal but becuase it's only one breast and it has gone larger she would refer me to the one stop breast clinic. I went yesterday and the docters examined me.. he also said he couldn't feel anything but becuase it was painfull to touch they would ultra sound me. I watched the screen and a spotted it before the nurse. A big Ugley lumpy mass that was gray and looked like a tall scab. She shouted the docter over who's face panicked me. He said hes 95 % that it's nothing bad but took a biopsy.  I'm freaking out becuase I've never seen a lump like it. I have to wait to weeks for results. Did anyone esle she there lump? I'm 29 x",
