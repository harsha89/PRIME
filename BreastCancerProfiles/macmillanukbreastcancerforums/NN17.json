      "Content": "Hi All At what point do you get a copy of pathology report? I know my tumour 180mm and weighed 1126g so when I went my GP initially twice with discomfort then she was wrong to put it down to muscular. It's a grade 3 cancer and nobody will tell me an estimate it has been there. Well it can't reach to over 7inch which is 18cm overnight. ? I noticed it on 2015 and went the GP more than twelve months ago. Had mastectomy and due to start chemo S positive lymph nodes which am mortified about. Any guess to the rate of breast cancer?  I won't quote anyone. Is  it around 2-5 years?  ",

      "Content": "I was advised I had a stage 2/grade 2 Ductal C aged 38. After surgery not given a report as others have stated on here. I advised prior probably on need radiotherapy. Devastated to learn yesterday at post op appointment that it was a large 65mm tumour (about 6.5) and although ultrasound thought No lymph involvement the SLNB confirmed positive. I will start chemo in 10 days time over a six month period followed by radio and 10 years of tamoxifen rather than advised 5 years.  Does this now change the stage of the cancer ? Should I have a pathology / histology report ?  Advised cold cap causes brain freeze and won't work with chemo to treat breast cancer.  I don't want tamoxifen nor chemo but have no choice. The Consultant advised I should be able to work during treatment ??? Hard as nails. Don't think so. Dreading hair loss. Does everyone get hair loss as I believe there is a tablet you can take to prevent? Heartbroken and out of my mind as have young son. Wanted another baby but even lost the chance of that as injections will shut down ovaries. ",

      "Content": "Have you being given injections to boost the white cells ? It needs further investigation as its a long period of time. I was treated for sepsis initially but then pneumonia and ended up in hospital. I don't wish to make you afraid as this is not in my intention. You should be referred to haematologist for further investigation. ",
