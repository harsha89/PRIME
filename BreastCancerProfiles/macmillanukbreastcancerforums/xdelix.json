      "Content": "Wow thanks for all your help and support everyone. Looks like need to speak to my grandma to see which gene she has (if she can remember, it has taken its toll on her and her memory) the tool is a great suggestion I will certainly look, there are no other women in the family other than those mentioned initially but hopefully it will help me get a better idea. Thank you Kacang it is worth looking into this (we assumed it was a side effect from the treatment she was receiving for Crohn's disease, as it is an experimental drug and other cases have since been noted with other patients). Crystaljuju I think they tested my grandma as her mother passed away due to breast cancer (again late in life). I think my plan for now will be to follow your advice and raise it casually in the new year, I know if my mum knows I am worried that she will do it, I just don't want to pressure her. can anyone give me any tips on how to assess myself? I have followed guidelines but find it difficult as they both feel quite lumpy in the middle and they are tender too. Some guides say to squeeze the nipple and look for liquid, it doesn't say what I am looking for in the liquid though. There is only a very small amount of fluid and I think it is clear, it doesn't leak into my bra or anything, I've never had children but would you still say this is normal? My right breast aches most days too but I think this is probably phantom pains in light of what has happened.   thanks again everyone x  ",

      "Content": "hi everyone, sorry I feel a bit like a fraud being on here as I have no diagnosis. My grandmother of 82 has just had a mastectomy due to breast cancer, she is coping well and taking each day as it comes now. Her Macmillan nurse has told her she carries the gene and the family must be tested.  My mum is aware of this but she is already battling bladder cancer and another serious illness. I don't think she has taken the test to see if she has the BC gene as it is probably just too much for her to face. I completely understand and don't want to add any pressure or guilt but I am anxious to know if she carries the gene as this puts myself, sister and niece at risk too. We're not too good at talking in my family and generally always try to stay positive and ignore the difficulties to enjoy the time we are together. We found out in the summer about the gene and mum made it clear she had no intention of having the test before her holiday in September. It's now December and still there has been no mention, I don't want to raise it now as it will affect Christmas and her all clear at 3 month check up on bladder. as my mum is in her late 50s with no sign of BC and my grandmother and her mother (my great grandmother) were not diagnosed till late in life should I even worry at age 30? i would be really grateful for any advice from anyone in my position or a mother who may help me talk to my mum.   thank you x",
