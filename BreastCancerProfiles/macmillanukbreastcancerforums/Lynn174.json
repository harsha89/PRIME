      "Content": "Hi Sparkydog, I know it's hard but it will get easier, if you feel like crying just cry that's what I do.  The pains don't necessarily mean the cancer is back, do you have a BC nurse?  I have one and when I'm having bad days I call her and she usually manages to calm me down and see reason. I had my mastectomy last year just after I was diagnosed, then had 6 rounds of chemo and 3 weeks of radiotherapy.  I'm now on tamoxifen, and I go into hospital on the 1st November for my reconstruction surgery. It's a tough path we are on now, but you need to remember you are not alone.  We are all here for you. Sending you big hugs. Lynn",
