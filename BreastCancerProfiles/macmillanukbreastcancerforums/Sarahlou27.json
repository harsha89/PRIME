    "Content": "Hi Nicky, I had a bilateral mastectomy on July 10th and have expandable implants with the strattice graft. The other option for me was to take muscle from my shoulder, but would still require an implant with this. My surgeon advised that the shoulder muscle would give a slightly more natural look but there wasn't much in it. So I'm now 4 weeks post surgery, my plastic surgeon is really pleased with his work which makes me feel confident but I must admit that it is taking time for me to accept how they look & feel but it is still early days.  After the surgery I kept on top of pain relief as it was painful & tight for the first week or so. It's surprising how much you use your chest muscles to do things...sitting up/turning/lifting arms etc were a bit of a mission for a week or 2. I have a port on each side for the saline injections, they look part of my ribs, but are a bit uncomfortable to lie on (I think from week 3 I was able to lie on my side to sleep....it is bliss!). Everyone's recovery is different but you really need to be kind to yourself & listen to your body. I am 32 & was quite active before this, and it has been hard for me to take it easy, but I want to make sure I recover in the best way to try & avoid any complications.   If there's anything else I can help with please just ask. Wishing you the best of luck! Sarah x",
