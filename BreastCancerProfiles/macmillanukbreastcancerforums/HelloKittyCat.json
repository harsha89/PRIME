      "Content": "Hi I had a left mastectomy and reconstruction done nearly 4 weeks ago.  I didn't fit in any bras I brought for after the surgery as the swellings so big I had to order crop tops to wear as I have a enormous left boob and the other is a E cup I know I will be wearing these for a while. They are so comfortable.  I haven't padded out the other boob to match yet but I know I will at some point but for now I need to concentrate on recovering from the surgery. ",

Because of the size I had to have a crop top on for extra support, I didn't think I was going to swell up so much. My doctor thinks they migh need to do a bit liposuction on the boob after. Thane shirt dress tips and nightie in with u  Wear leggings to go home in in case u have any drains in ",

Got a cheque through the post 3 weeks after the form was sent. I was then contacted by willow who arrange special days for people. They have arranged for me and my kids to go to Blackpool for 4 days ",
