    "Content": "Hi Ladies, When my mum was diagnosed 5 years ago with a very treatable sarcoma on her arm she closed right up.  Insisted that no one in the family knew apart from her children (I have a brother and sister) and her sister.  Omg it was awful like a dark secret that we weren't allowed to talk about.  She had an operation and radiotherapy and unfortunately the secret got out and mum went loopy.  Mum was ashamed of having C she didn't really know how to deal with it.  Thankfully it was treatable and we moved on after but she struggled at every check up. March last year I went with mum and dad to get check up as she was more agitated than normal.  It was a day that will haunt me for possibly the rest of my life,  mums cancer was back and she was terminal.  There and then I was determined that it would be different this time not just because she was dying but because we needed to have all our family around us to help and support us.  I had to ring and tell everyone,  could barely get the words out but I did for my mum.   The love and support she got from everyone was wonderful and it made her realise just how much she was loved.  Without my family I'm not sure I would have gotten through.  Sadly mum died September last year, but with her family with her which I know mum was comforted by our closeness.  X",
