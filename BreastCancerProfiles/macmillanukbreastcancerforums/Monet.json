      "Content": "Hi folks, Had two cycles of chemo and the arm they give it in is really sore. It's not red or swollen but even the skin hurts and it hurts when I move it. It was slightly sore after the first cycle but it's worse this time and I've still got four to go. Mentioned it to my chemo nurse who said that it's one of those things and to take painkillers. I have another cycle in 10 days and just hope it settles as the thought of needles in that arm makes my toes curl! Had anyone had the same? Have you any tips? Thanx",
