    "Content": "I think this might be Mondor's cording. I had several of these following WLE/SNB (before radiotherapy) running under my breast and down across my ribs. They were very tender/painful at first but now, 9 months on, have almost gone away. There is information here about them (my BCN had not heard of them but I had them confirmed by my surgeon at a follow-up visit): http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-information/breast-awareness/benign-breast-conditions/mondors%C2%A0disease I'm sorry, don't know how to do it as a link but information can be found on the Breast Cancer Care website under the Benign Breast conditions tab if it doesn't work as a link.",
