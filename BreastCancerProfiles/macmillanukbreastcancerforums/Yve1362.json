      "Content": "Thank you for the information feel so much more reassured. I am dreading this. I noticed you mentioned cold cap worn during chemo, I did read about it and considered it , did oncologist give ok? My friends oncologist advised against, said he wanted to reach every cell in her body and had reservations about it? I lost my hair many years ago because of severe reaction to hair dye and dreading going through that again.  I really appreciate your response. So sorry to hear about your mum, can't imagine what that has been like for you.......... God you think you have problems but when you read what others have had thrown at them rather humbling Again thank you for taking the time to reply xxxxx",
