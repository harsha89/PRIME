      "Content": "Ladies, your responses overwhelm me...thank you!  Because if my age (42) I think they'll do an ultrasound but I'm not totally sure... I'm currently sat in the hospital grounds as I work here on the MAU dept seeing poorly people every shift (and lots of gowns haha) not really comprehending that Friday I'll be here as an outpatient...crazy! A colleague who went through same thing here at my trust said they did an examination then ultrasound on her, she then waited for doc who said it was a cyst, she was fine thankfully  I'm trying to be very positive but as it gets nearer it's more troubling... Hubby is now coming. I'll keep you posted and thank you for being so kind...and strong!!! ",

      "Content": "Apologies if this posts twice as I'm sure I replied earlier today.. I just wanted to say everything went well at the breast unit. I have multiple cysts, two of which they drained. I'm to keep an eye on the others and from now on I shall be checking both breasts regularly!  I underwent a mammogram (showed nothing as breat tissue too dense), then an ultrasound which clearly showed the cysts.  Thank you so much for your kind words, I wish you all the best ladies, xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi! sorry to hijack this thread marlog! I found a lump in my left breast 12 days ago and have my appointment at the breast unit this coming Friday. I was planning on going alone as assumed they wouldn't tell me anything on the day...am I wrong in assuming this?! Should my hubby come along just in case?  The lump is tender to touch which also lead me to assume it's nothing to worry about but like marlog the waiting is killing me! I feel very alone in all this.... Anyway any advice will be gratefully received  ",
