      "Content": "Hi Lollywg, I was lucky in that I had few problems after having my lumpectomy regardsing bras; Bravissimo do a short nightie that has built in support for nightwear- not cheap but very comfortable, I did go up a size with this; can also recommend Marks and Spencers Post Surgery range, I was able to stay with the same size cup with these- brought 2 but will be getting another couple possibly as having lymphnodes removed shortly and found these bras sit well below the previous scar and are REALLY comfy!! Am able to wear normal bras now also so there is light still at the end of the tunnel in that sense also. Hope this helps at least a little? Take care and hope the \"heffalumps\" are soon sorted Love and hugs, The Joker",
