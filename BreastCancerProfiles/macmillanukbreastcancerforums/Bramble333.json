    "Content": "Hi - I had stage 3a (5.5cm) grade 3 HER2 BC with 3 lymph nodes involved.  I was diagnosed in May 2014.  I had 8 sessions of chemo and had a pathological complete response - the tumour was gone and no evidence in the lymph nodes.  I had a lumpectomy at the beginning of December and 4 lymph nodes removed.  I have 19 sessions or radio (starting on Monday) and Herceptin to take until July. Whatever they throw at you, you can move forward.  The chemo doctor told me I was cancer free just before Christmas.  Also, I would say it is more important how you respond to treatment than the stage.  I know it is easier said than done, but try not to get too hung up on the stage.  I know many women 10 years down the line who had BC with lymph node involvement. Good luck with your results, but you will be able to move forward positively whatever they say to you,   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                ",
