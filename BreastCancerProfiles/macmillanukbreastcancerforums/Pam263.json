      "Content": "Hi Becky - at the moment I feel incredibly lucky as my consultant says I don't need chemo or radiotherapy- just a mastectomy.  When I read all the treatment other ladies are going through I feel I'm being a total whimp worrying about paper knickers just because I'm super big!  I do hope you start to feel better soon  luv n hugs  Pam xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn - thanks for your reply - yes that certainly has brought a smile to my face.  I'm just hoping they have stretchy knickers at my hospital & very stretchy at that! Lol The walking suggestion after op my be a bit more difficult as I also suffer with arthritis which makes walking painful- but we will try.  Hope you're recovering well love Pam xxx",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed on 1/4 & scheduled to have a mastectomy on 18/5 & had to go for my pre-op assessment yesterday. Up until this morning I feel as though I've had everything sorted in my mind (apart from stressing about surgery paper knickers which due to my size I'm convinced won't fit me!) but this morning I've had a complete meltdown- I've cried & feel if I start crying again I won't stop. I'm trying to be strong as my husband had a mini-stroke at the end of January. I know I'm being silly but just needed to tell someone ",
