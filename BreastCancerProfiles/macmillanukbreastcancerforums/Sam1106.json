      "Content": "Hi All I am devastated to find myself here again.  But I need support!!! Back in April 2012 I was diagnosed with Grade 3 DCIS in my left breast.  I had a bilateral mastectomy, FEC-T Chemotherapy and then Radiotherapy.  I then had DIEP Flap reconstruction in 2014 and all has been well. Nearly three weeks ago I had a miscarriage - a baby I was told I would never have due to treatment.  10 days after the miscarriage my right breast felt achey so I did my normal breast check and i found a lump. Its hard and movable. I phoned the doctor straight away and got an appointment yesterday, but as expected due to so many variables of what it could be and given my history, the doctor has referred me to the hospital breast clinic under the two week rule. I have an 8 year old daughter, who was only 2.5 last time and since then she has had to deal with losing her paternal grandfather to pancreatic cancer, me and her father divorcing and moving apart and then this year she has accepted my new partner.  I don't want to put her through all this again and I certainly don't want to put my new partner through it. My world has collapsed and I can only think the worst.  I have instructed a solicitor to update my will. Every is saying stay positive but we all said that last time!!! I don't know what to do",

      "Content": "Hi all Well I went in and had the right implant removed but unfortunately when I went back to see consultant on Friday 31st August I didn't have good news for him, the wound had opened up again to the point where I could see the drain tube inside my breast through the hole, so I ended up back in theatre on Monday 3rd September, this time it was my surgeon that performed the wash out and he also notice fat necrosis forming and removed it so I was really saw again after coming round.  I am so heavily dressed and starpped that I can't see if its healing or not.  Saw the consultant on Friday and was advised to empty the drain bag on Friday night and if it remained empty over the weekend to call the clinic this morning to arrange to go in and have the drain taken out.  So I am due in the clinic today at 1pm so I know then if this stupid wound is healing or not.",

      "Content": "Hi I had a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction on 24th July and my wound started leaking on the right side on 5th August.  Consultant redressed it and put me on antibiotics but then last Wednesday he had to remove so unhealthy skin and re-stitch it, then on Friday he decided to put a drain in and send some of the fluid off for culture and today he called me back in.  The stitches haven't held and wound has opened up again and lab results show bacteria so I am back in tomorrow morning for emergency surgery to remove the implant and wash the wound out and then stitched back up.  Another implant will not be put back in now until after chemo and radiotherapy.  This step has to be done as they can't and don't want to delay my chemo and the antibiotics are just not dealing with the infection. I am totally gutted and upset :-( ",
