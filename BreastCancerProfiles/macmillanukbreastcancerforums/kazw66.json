      "Content": "Thought I would share this as it may be the same for you. I finished rads two weeks ago, and like so many of you was advised to use aqueous cream generously during and after treatment. Whilst having treatment I was given purilon gel to put onto my skin where my mx wound was still weeping, which I did and this healed very quickly, I was also told to use  this if any other areas broke open. Since then I have had a patch of skin which became incredibly dry and flaky, I continued with the aqueous until Saturday night when it finally split, I began to use the purilon in that area. Today I went to my GP as I wanted her to take a look at the area of skin that had broken down and was weeping slightly and my clothes were beginning to stick , she asked what I had been using and I gave her the info leaflet from the hospital. She told me that aqueous cream is very heavy on detergent and that in some cases it aggreivates the skin rather than soothes and to stop using it immediately. Am glad I went to see her as there are more patches becoming crisp and I hope stopping using the cream will prevent  it from splitting. K",

I have coped with all that has been thrown at me but today for some reason I feel really down, anxious about finishing rads and hospital visits slowing down, in case it all come back again. Cannot explain how I feel just not  feeling my normal bubbly self. Sorry to offload, I do try so hard to remain positive. x",

To have mine I did have a shot of pethadine and was given a sedative, was also given local and  that was probably the most uncomfortable part of it, I think I made it worse imagining all sorts, but it was fine. Two hours later I had treatment through it I was in hospital most of the day, but felt absolutely fine afterwards. Hope this helps  Karen x",
