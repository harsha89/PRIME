    "Content": "Hello Kat :) (Amy, 20, in remission)  It is easy to jump to cancer in your head but try to remain calm.  You should go to the doctors and tell them about it but make sure they listen to you! It took doctors that didn't listen to me a year to diagnose me, by which point it had spread a lot.  There are many things it could be like a cyst or something. But it is best to get it checked! ",
