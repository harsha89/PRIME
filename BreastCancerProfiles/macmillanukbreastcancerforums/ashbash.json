I was diagnosed mid June, had all the same feelings, but if it's any help at all to have treatment underway is really empowering . At least it helps you feel in control of something. Best of luck on Monday, there is loads of help out there, so if  the diagnosis is confirmed, do not despair- here we all are proof that there is hope, Aisling x x x          ",

Good look with further cell removal, just lovin all their terminology   Ash x x x",

      "Content": "Hiya Jules, Hope this post works. I had an MRI before I started treatment,  and another one half way thru Chemo.Think most people have them at some stage during treatment. I know they used mine to determine the exact size  and location of of the lump. I was told that they will use the MRI to work out the exact place where the lump had been so they can zap the right place. Also great to know that if there was evidence that it had spread elsewhere they would be on to it.  I am  off to the Hospital too-meeting RT consultant on Tuesday to plan RT, so hoping to get that all underway asap, tho have been told end of January. Seems like a long wait.I just want to get on with it now and get it over with. Tho' must admit I am a bit scared about how I will feel when all the treatment is finished. Will I be able to draw a line under the BC or will it be like a dark thing sitting on my shoulder all the time reminding me that it might come back. I will have to work hard at positive thoughts. Great that your  hair is growing. I am so excited as my eyelashes  and eyebrows are definitely coming back. After all these months of looking like a skinned rabbit I am definitely starting to look more human again, well as human as can be expected under the circs! Might try the olive oil massage, mmm. Maybe a good greasy slick of oil will stop my husband rubbing his hand on my stubble ALL the time, even in public. He just can't seem to stop himself. LOL!! Good luck on Tuesday! Ash x",

      "Content": "Definitely agree with Suki. I started taking it about 6 weeks ago, two weeks after my last chemo.In the grand scheme of things the Tamoxifen is minor and a small price to pay. Having said that tho' the 'Tropical Moments' have been murderous. Can't seem to get my body temp properly regulated at all and have to wear layers that I can whip off quickly before I expire. Doesn't seem to be having an impact on my hair, that is growing back really well and actually have quite a thick covering now. Not sure about the weight gain yet as with the whole Christmas thing and not doing much after the mastectomy 4 weeks ago is probably what has caused the floppy bit round my middle. !!",

      "Content": "Hi Debbie, In shock myself as will be in same position as you soon. Having chemo now, to be followed by mastectomy. Nobody mentioned any thing about  full node clearance at all . Wish I had known as had chemo first to see if tumour could be shrunk so I could have lumpectomy. But MRI showed cancer in another part of the same breast so was told straight away it would have to go, but now all pointless really, as will have no breast and now no nodes. This thing just keeps getting better and better. Best of luck with the op, at least it's another step closer to being over,keep us filled in on how it all goes, Cheers, Aisling    ",

Have joint meeting with onc,surgeon and radio guy in a couple of weeks and have been told that I have been allocated radio guy who prefers longer radio. Do we have any choice in this at all? Also scared to be taking decisions into my own hands in this situation as what if it all comes back to bite me? Will follow this with interest... good luck with it all, Aisling  ",
