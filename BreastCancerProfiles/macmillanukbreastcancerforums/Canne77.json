Then you say to yourself YOU ARE STRONG AND IT WILL NOT BEAT ME  Many rivers to cross and I'll probably sink a little along the way but i will not drown (Sorry for the rant but i had to get that out)",

      "Content": "Hi guys I'm inbetween 1/2 chemo sessions due to have my 2nd next Friday. My hair is very loose right now and losing if I simply touch my head although it feels like it falls out if I just LOOK at it!  I was embracing this part of the treatment up until NOW - now its happening and its hit me and it don't make it feel better that I have got pain on my scalp too and the headaches are literally waking me up It's so emotional I did cut all my hair into a pixie cut to make the pain ease off and the pain is getting worse. I'm not ready to shave it just yet.  In anybody else experience with this how long does the pain last for is it the entire time that the hair falls out?",
