      "Content": "Hi, my mum had her masectomy 10 days ago and things are healing really well.  However now the dressing is ok, weve noticed her skin is puckering at the edge of her wound near her underarm.  Is this common?  we can see it might aggravate her possibly.  I know its early days and that maybe her wound will flatten a litte but could this mean more surgery? I just wondered if anyone else has had this?",
