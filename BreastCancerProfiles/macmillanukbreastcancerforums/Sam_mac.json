      "Content": "Hi there, I've just started a cycle of docetaxel, but my initial plan was to have 2 more EC cycles (I've had 2 so far) and then move on to docetaxel. EC hasn't shrunk the tumours much, and my onco decided that, taking into consideration the bad time I was having on EC she wanted to move me over to docetaxel. I was bit taken aback with the u-turn in my treatment regimen, so forgot to ask why she thought the EC wasn't working (!) Can't seem to get a decent answer on the interwebs so thought I would pop a post here and see if anybody else has experienced EC not working very well. I've got a grade 2/3 inflammatory breast cancer with lymph node involvement, ER positive, HER negative. Much appreciated, Sam",

      "Content": "Thanks Crystaljuju and Dreamthief, very helpful :) Makes sense about the hormonal positive BC tending not to be so reactive to chemo as other BC types, maybe that's why it's not working so well. As you point out, there's no way of knowing what will happen until you take the drugs. Had docetaxel (T) treatment yesterday, all good at the mo, jumping up and down with an energy high, no doubt thanks to the steroids, but preparing myself for the SE onslaught :)  But yes, hoping T will work better - review after 2 cycles, we'll see.",

      "Content": "That's true, I think they are pretty much on the case, so I can be grateful for that. I was partly glad to be moved off EC because it was so horrible but felt a bit upset that it hadn't worked, after all that. I always seem to walk away from my onco sessions, with a bunch of questions I haven't asked! I guess I'm also curious about the chemistry behind it all, and why EC wouldn't work. Anyway, fingers crossed that the docetaxel is a more effective. Thanks pinkshoe xx",
