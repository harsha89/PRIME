Other friends have brought meals, one cycling in the rain as her car was in the garage. This journey has made me think about how I will look after friends who need my help in the future.

      "Content": "My surreal world just gets worse. 3 months ago I found a lump that doctors assured me was 'normal breast tissue', but they would investigate it just to be sure. On mammo, ultrasound and MRI it looked harmless, but thankfully they did a core biopsy. 2 weeks ago my surgeon couldn't find my lump pre-op as it had shrunk significantly after 1 month of Tamoxifen. I was in theatre for 3 hours having a WLE and SNB. My notes also said that 1 'palpable' node was removed. Yesterday I saw the BCN (with my 19 year daughter, on the day of her A level results, as my husband was at work) to be told that they had removed a 55mm lump and the edges showed signs of pre-cancerous cells and the node was also affected. Now I need a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have to decide whether to have the chemo or the surgery first. I'm thinking that I will have the chemo first, but that decision is based purely on the fact that I'm scared of the surgery! I have good friends and a supportive family who say we'll do this together, so perhaps one of them will have the mastectomy for me! They also try to reassure me that life will get back to 'normal'. What I do know is that at 2.40am I would rather be sleeping than posting on here! Take care Anita",

The first lot of chemo made me neutropenic and I couldn't cope with the colitis as well. I ended up being admitted for iv antibiotics and steroids. The advantage is that now both my consultants are discussing my case and treating me as a whole person with 2 tedious diseases and not 2 completely separate issues. I had my 2nd lot of chemo yesterday - my regime has been reduced to 'EC' (the F has been removed and E reduced, althoufgh I've been reassured it will still be effective). I feel fine today with none of the symptoms from last time. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi Tracie The year you described reminded me of 1992. We started the year having a premature baby who died, followed by a car accident, my husband fell off his motorbike, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and my Grandma died . By the end of the year I had a new car, hubby had recovered from his injuries, the colitis was stabilised and I was pregnant again. The point I'm trying to make is that life moves on and it isn't always as bad as it seems at the moment. Gradually other things will become more important in our lives than this damned disease. Just remember you've had an enormous amount to put up with over the last few months and you're still strong. I don't think you're being paranoid as it perfectly acceptable to have some worries about the cancer spreading, but we need to keep that in perspective and not let it take over our lives. I have been off work since the end of July and I don't anticipate going back until I've finished radiotherapy scheduled for Feb/March. I do miss work, but I don't feel that I could manage it at the moment, especially whilst having sleepless nights due to steroids. Make sure you are ready to go back and I assume they have you on a phased return to work in case you can't manage the 24 hours. You may find that you find more energy from doing something. Just take care of yourself xx Anita",

I go on to half pay this month so I'll have to see how that works out. I stopped work a few days before my lumpectomy, because I was having regular visits to outpatients for pre-op assessments, ultrasounds, CT scans etc. My original treatment plan was to have a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy so I thought I would work on the days I could manage and my line manager was willing to support me in this. Following my lumpectomy my GP surprised me by signing me off for 3 months to cover the time I would be having radiotherapy without questioning it. Unfortunately my treatment plan has changed and 4 weeks after the lumpectomy I had a mastectomy then 4 weeks following that I started chemo. The Oncologist does not want me to work as I am an Infection Prevention Nurse and visit areas with outbreaks and patients with infection. As I have had various side effects including neutropenia on almost every cycle I would not have been able to work anyway. Some days I feel great and meet friends for lunch etc and had a short break with my hubby. I do feel guilty on these days but they are few and far between! The 3 month sick note has been repeated by another GP, but my current sick note is only for 6 weeks and runs out at the during my radiotherapy treatment, so I've made an appointment to discuss with my GP about returning to work. Mum suffers from dementia and is in a care home and I'm not visiting her as much as I used to and avoiding the first week or so after chemo because of my problems with neutropenia Anyway, we are not funded at the tax payers expense. It is out of the public purse which is a fund that we all contribute towards in different ways and it should be viewed as an insurance for people who need it. Anita",

Thank goodness you went for your routine mammogram as it shows that everyone does not present with recognised symptoms, but these developments must be difficult to comprehend. I think it is the speed that things change that is alarming. You enter the Consulting Room expecting some news and a few minutes later you leave the room with your world turned upside down. Like you say the scan is being done quickly and then you can have a treatment plan. I felt better once I had a plan of action and although it hasn't been easy I've been able to break the journey into stages so at least I can see an end to each stage.

I had a small lump that was disappearing with tamoxifen but when they did the lumpectomy and removed the nodes I had 55cm of invasive lobular, invasive ductal and DCIS with no clear margins. I also had 1 node affected. I couldn't sleep and I would cry at unexpected times, which isn't like me! Whilst I didn't think my time was up the thought of surgery and chemo did not appeal. Anyway, I had my mastectomy at the beginning of September and now I'm half way through my chemotherapy. Whilst I am not exactly sailing through the treatment neither have been the ordeal that I imagined they would be. I just keep thinking that only 1 node was affected and the chemo and radiotherapy are my insurance policy to be extra sure that they have killed off any little seedlings that may be there.
