      "Content": "Thank you TheSciptFan, it's good to meet someone with the same diagnosis. I've been pretty honest with her and she's now said she would like to come to chemo with me when she's not at college so that's a great idea. I also asked her to help me with scarves/makeup if/when my hair falls out and she's really up for that which should be interesting... I've got the feeling I'll be on this site quite a lot! Thanks again and hope you are ok xx",

My 18 year old (next month) daughter is of course very anxious; does anyone know if there are any online support groups for family members and especially teenagers?Â ",
