      "Content": "Hi Fiddlesticks I am so sorry to hear about your experience but I have not been able to wear M & S bras for years well before my diagnosis and subsequent mastectomy.  I have been buying the Triumph Amourette underwired bras and they come with matching knickers (they also do a non-underwired version) they are a bit more expensive but they last a long time. The colours vary according to the season but they do offer some choice.  I was very pleased when my BC nurse told me she was able to supply an implant to use in my underwired bra and she was right, and even more pleased as I had just purchased several new sets prior to my diagnosis! Also try Nicola Jane a company who specialise in post surgery underwear and swimwear. Enjoy your holiday. Sarah xx",

      "Content": "Finished chemo in March and radiotherapy in May; hair had started to grow back a bit by then and then quite rapidly but at various lengths.  Saw my hairdresser in July and she recommend we even it up so had a no. 2 and have had a second cut a month later.  It is very fine and grey/white but at least I have got some even ventured out today without my wig for the first time!  It has been a bit like wearing a bobble hat in the middle of summer.  Eyelashes back too and long enough to wear mascara so feeling a bit more human.",
