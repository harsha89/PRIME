      "Content": "Hi Ev1. WARNING LONG POST AHEAD!  Well I had my first Mr T today which was all good. It took an hour to go in through Picc. No effects yet but I'm told they'll come day 3 or 4 and feel like, and I quote, \" You've been hit by a bus, dragged through a hedge backwards and are getting the flu all in one go! \" that was the BC manager in the unit! Oh the joys lol. On a good note Onco is really pleased with tumours and says they are definitely reducing well. Still on for mastectomy because of lymph node involvement and Her + etc but I'm happy with that. AMANDA - Hi. Glad you were good on 1st Mr T. 4 1/2 ours is so long! Did you not have a PICC? hope today was ok for 2nd T. Keep us all updated xxx SARAHJ48 - Yes I'm still having periods, light and clotty and lasting up to 11days! Hope you're feeling better and have a little more energy.  JOJOMOJO - I had a bad period after my 2nd FEC which was awful. It felt like labour pains again. That was my worst fec and I'm convinced that it was because of the period symptoms. My 3rd was much easier so hopefully now that you have that bad period out of the way your second one won't be as bad. As for your hair. I found that as soon as I shaved my head the tingling and pain and sensitivity stopped. Look at the good side, no blow drying, straightening etc. Just get out of the shower and dry with a towel!  CHRISSIE - You're getting Mr T tomorrow aren't you? Mine wasn't bad at all today, see above. Start taking pain meds on day 3 morning before pain kicks in. That was advice from BC nurse and friend that's just been through it. X NADJIE - Good luck with 3rd fec tomorrow. My 3rd was my easiest. Hope it's the same for you honey xxx LEE - Thanks for the heads up on the T. Hopefully it'll be like that for me. As for PICC, if you are offered it, get it! It is the best thing honestly. I've had mine from day one and it's been amazing. No more injections, it gets flushed once a week which takes 5mins and chemo is given so much quicker! Instead of 4 1/2 hrs getting T today mine was done in 1 hr and my FEC only took 20mins each time. I love my PICC it makes life so much easier. Herceptin is given into the leg or stomach not IV. It takes approx 5 mins to get. The first one you get you have to stay in afterwards for 6hrs to make sure you don't take a reaction then a couple of hours 2nd time, after that you're in and out in 10mins Providing you don't react badly.   BIRTY - Hope things are getting better re your DVT.  MAGS + REGINA - Hope you and mum are doing well. Can't believe your mum is still working etc.. She's obviously a strong woman xxx TRISHIE BABES - How are you honey?  Love vey and hugs to all and God bless xxxx",

The tiredness is the worst and have lost sense of taste. Mouth a bit sore but not too bad. I just feel like I haven't slept for a week even though I've done nothing but sleep!  Does anyone one know if you get an up period with T? With fec I was bad until about day 9/10 then started to feel lots better. Just wondering if it's the same with T? or do the pains etc just last til end of chemo now? Need something to look forward to. Lol. I used to count down the days on fec knowing day 9 was getting near the end of feeling rough.  Hows everyone one else on T at the minute?  God bless",

      "Content": "Morning all. Hope everyone is having a good day so far.  I just oust wanted to encourage anyone who is coming up to getting their Mr T. Yes I had a bit of a rough time with the infection but I'm prone to infections anyway. The pains weren't as bad as what I thought they'd be. They were more jaggy here and there more than solidly in the one place. My advice to anyone is to start taking the pain meds as soon as you start to feel the pain coming on and remember to take your temperature just before each dose to make sure your not masking a high temperature. The good news is that with the Mr T I was only feeling bad from day 2-6 whereas with FEC I was bad from days 1-9/10. The side effects for me definitely didn't last as long. My nails were sore for a few days but they're right as rain again :-). So please everyone don't be petrified like me of what 'might' happen. It has been doable! And you know what? If a wuss like me can do it, then anyone can!  A man is telling his neighbor, \"I just bought a new hearing aid. It cost me $4000, but it's state of the art. It's perfect.\" \"Really?\" answers the neighbor. \"What kind is it?\" \"12:30.\"  My friend thinks he is smart. He told me an onion is the only food that makes you cry, so I threw a coconut at his face. Q: What do you call a pig that does karate?  A: A pork chop. God bless  xxx",

I really didn't think I needed anything stronger although the hospital said if I found I needed something stronger just to phone them. Also I didn't need the painkillers to day 6 as the pain wasn't bad enough to need painkillers.  Hopefully you will get few side effects and breeze through it.  Im getting Herceptin with my next Mr T next Tuesday. Not looking forward to it as my unit keep you in for 6hrs after your first Herceptin to make sure you don't take a reaction. No-one I've spoken to have had a reaction to it so hopefully there won't be any problems but I'll keep you all updated.  Xxx",

I'm due my 1st T on Tuesday :-/ Really getting a bit panicky as its back to the unknown and a new set of side effects. I've to take 4 x steroids twice tomorrow and then 4 again on Tuesday before treatment. Not looking forward to that as they bring on my panic attacks. I've only had one hot flush so far on FEC but i hear you get more and night sweats on T.  Is ads anyone else still having periods? I took mine a week late and awful symptoms after FEC 2, then again this time 11days early on FEC 3 which lasted for 9 days. It was a lot lighter this time with no symptoms but still. I thought it would have stopped by now? Anyone else having them still?  Ive been looking for some good jokes for you all but as you can tell, they're not very good.

They have said that I'll be having Herceptin injections for a year and then I think I take it in tablet form for 5 years. Don't know really, they don't tell you much in our chemo unit unless you ask specifically. Does anyone know if Tamoxifen is the same sort of thing as Herceptin? I haven't been told if I'll be having Tamoxifen. I really must do a list of questions to ask on Tuesday.  Ok let's see if I can come up with any jokes for you all today......

A: Identitties.   A drunk  woman was sitting at a bar says to the barman, \"Barfender, I'd like a marhini for my heartburn.\" The barman mixes her drink and puts in down in front of her. A few minutes later, she calls him over and says, \"Barfender, I'd like a marhini for my heartburn.\" He rolls his eyes but mixes her drink anyway and sets it down in front of her. A few minutes later, she waves him over again and says, \"Barfender, I'd like a marhini for my heartburn.\" The barman looks her up and down and says, \"First off, it's bartender, not barfender. Second off, it's martini, not marhini. And third, you don't have heartburn, your boob is in the ashtray.\"  We gotta laugh eh?  God bless ",

      "Content": "Well hello all my beautiful bunnies! I'm so sorry if I worried everyone with my absence. And guess what?! George was right AGAIN! Typical George, always in the know lol. I did end up in hospital with an infection!  Wednesday 17th I had to go for my heart scan. I was day 9 post 1st T. I was getting through pretty well and was even running around playing with Kaitlyn before school. We left for the hospital at 8:15 to be at hospital for my 9 am appointment. By the time we reached the hosp half an hour later I felt awful. I was on fire! The lovely nurse doing the scan put a fan on me and I started to feel well enough to get the scan done. We were walking to the car afterwards and I started to feel really bad again so I dropped in to the chemo unit to see one of the nurses. She took my blood pressure and temperature and said, \"Right we gotta get you lying down\". So I was taken to an isolation bay and immediately put on an I.V antibiotic. Loads and loads of blood samples were taken from my picc and directly from my hands and I had to have 15min obs. They kept me there for a few hours then sent me home with oral antibiotics. Therefore I've been feeling pretty rough and as most of you know, when I feel bad I don't post, I hibernate! I really didn't mean to worry anyone, sorry. So the update! I'm feeling much better today and yesterday and my taste is finally starting to return! My nails aren't as sore but look dreadful despite me using Vaseline intensive hand and nail cream on them and baby oil. The heels of my feet feel like I have two huge blisters but I can't see anything on them. I'm very tired this time but so glad to be on the good side now ( day 12 post 1st T ). Only 2 more Mr T's to go thank the Lord. I also had a bit of a melt down and cried like a hungry baby one of the days but it did me the world of good and I felt so much better after it. I think it must be the chemo effects as I'm not really a crier in fact that was only the second time I've cried since diagnosis on 12 March.  Hope me everyone is doing well and not suffering too much. How are all you Mr T daters? Is he being good to you?  Thank you to everyone that was asking about me, you're all such a lovely bunch. God bless bunnies. Hope you're all having a lovely weekend.

Lol Nadjie - I didn't get the sickness with the T but did still take sickness meds for a couple of days after just in case.  Ok folks, just one joke today sorry:  A child asked his father, \"How were people born?\" So his father said, \"Adam and Eve made babies, then their babies became adults and made babies, and so on.\" The child then went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told him, \"We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are now.\" The child ran back to his father and said, \"You lied to me!\" His father replied, \"No, your mom was talking about her side of the family.\" God bless sweeties.

      "Content": "Morning all.  Chrissie - I do have the oestrogen fed one and HR2 So dony know what way that'll work then.  Hev - I've no idea what the injection in my tummy is called but it's to boost the blood cells and it's given 24hrs after treatment.  Nadjie - Ive forgotten what u asked! Lol. Chemo brain!  Well the district nurse couldn't get bloods yesterday out of picc . That's the past 2wks and no blood. The last time the unit got blood was when I had to go in with the high temp and it took her ages and she was v aggressive with it. So I have been praying there's no clot or something that means the picc has to be removed. Chrissie I was up half the night also with the steroids! Wish I'd checked my phone. We could've had a natter. Lol. Tomato face today too.  Well lets hope we get the wee man on the rusty bike! Love and hugs to all having treatment this week. Xxx love you all loads, your such a comfort and a bit nuts too! Lol. Just like me!  Hows everyones hair doing? I've got fuzz but it's WHITE!!!!! There's some dark brown in there but it's so fine you need a magnifying glass to see it!!!! I didn't have much grey before this either!!!!! I'm gonna be a snowy head!!!  God bless Crazies! ( meant in the most affectionate way!) xxx",

      "Content": "Posted by kazza2108 on 2 Aug 2015 3:32 PM Hi All Well that's my chemo all done! Yayyyyy! I must say though the last one for me was the worst. Don't panic though! I had a stinking cold before I got my last MrT and I think that had a lot to do with how bad I was. The cough I have developed from that cold is horrendous and I get coughing bouts that almost had me buying Tenna Ladies! So glad chemo is over now and still surprised I did it! Gotta share this with you! My hubby has wanted an English Bull Terrier dog since he was a wee lad. He never thought he'd get one and prides himself on none of us being able to do anything that he doesn't know about! He was so smug lol  So as its coming up to his birthday and he's been doing so much for me ( holding everything together, washing, cooking, cleaning etc ) I got the kids together and we came up with a cunning plan! A month we managed to keep it from him! I got onto a breeder on the other side of Ireland and arranged everything, then sent my daughter and son-in-law to a hotel 'for her birthday' to collect the pup afterwards. So yesterday we welcomed this new addition to the family! Hubby was gobsmacked! Everyone, meet Skye....... karin",
