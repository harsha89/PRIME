      "Content": "Hi just wanted to share my experience. I had wle in February and since then my nipple is exactly as you describe. My surgeon assured me it\u2019s the scar tissue but as I was still a little anxious he arranged an ultrasound and he was right. As the scar tissue forms it tightens and was pulling the nipple in. Started my radiotherapy now with peace of mind. Hope all goes well . Big hugs xx nicky xxx",
