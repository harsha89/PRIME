      "Content": "I'm so sorry you are feeling so rough. I too suffered with headaches but I'm not sure whether that was due to the cold cap. It felt like it was coming from my neck and into my head. Have you tried self massage? Or is there someone who could perhaps massage your neck and shoulders for you. I think we are all under so much stress we just don't realise and you carry it in your head neck and shoulders. Everything is worth a try. The nausea Kath is vile. I hated it but eventually it does pass. You could ring your cancer unit and ask for a different med to sort it. I went through this route myself on the second round of FEC I had but the side effects were also vile and I'm now in the search for some natural remedies. It's still worth asking as my friend was prescribed a different med which suited her and she sailed through the rest of her chemo. Hope you feel much better soon. Jacquie",

      "Content": "I'm just about to start my second FEC on Friday 10/1. My first one went ok, it was administered very slowly by a great nurse. I am concerned about this coming one as I've heard it's much harder on your body. Can anyone give me a clue as how to cope. I had throat ulcers first round ( nasty) and never having had them before it was a total shock. Eating was virtually impossible. My oncologist has prescribed some meds but anyone know of any natural remedies please?",

      "Content": "Hi Tracy I finished my chemo 11/4/14 and felt pretty rough for quite a few weeks, BUT IT DOES GET BETTER, Â and as everyone says just go with however you feel. I have a great onco and plastic surgery team around me and they have been brilliant in my overall recovery together with the help of my friends and family. It is a long and very hard journey we go through and its not always easy to let anyone know how you feel as sometimes it seems you are upset all the time. Talking for me, works, for others not so. I think you have to find what works for you as an individual. Everyone on the community website has helped me in lots of ways. Sometimes I just read what others have written, and I think 'wow I feel like that' and dont feel so fearful or sad. Sometimes funny stories crop up which we can all relate to. i hope you are feeling much stronger soon but if you ever want to message me please feel free to do so. Mahoosive healing hugs your way.

      "Content": "Thank you both so much. I'm struggling physically which has affected me emotionally. I'm home now and feeling better, I think it was just hard seeing everyone after such a horrendous few weeks. It's our own business so it's difficult for me not to be there. I am lucky I can work from home but sometimes I need to sort out problems like the inland revenue (who were fantastic even when I started sobbing like a ninny). Our accountant is brilliant sending one of his girls to try and help me through the minefield, no charge I might add. To be honest I'm so lucky to have the people I have around me but sometimes I feel so alone. Yes I can afford to do yoga but I haven't been able to get out for the past 10 days or so. I would love to have a massage but I was told I couldn't have one, yet I've seen other people mention massage. I think I will bring it up again as I know it has helped in the past when I've been stressed. Putting my feelings down has helped too, I don't like to worry my wonderful husband or children. They are worrying enough and so telling you guys has been a fantastic release. Thanks again from the bottom of my heart and massive hugs to you both. Love Jacquie",

I have oncologist appointment Friday and I know my situation is being discussed but not really sure what I should be asking. Just wondered if anyone had gone through similar situation? Ive had the last of my FEC and start Tax 28/2. Im still trying to be positive but this last treatment has floored me and emotionally i am losing it. My poor husband has been a rock but I just cant seem to stop crying. I tried to spend a day in our office today and cried to our accountant and the Inland Revenue.......had to go home, I just cant talk to anyone without sobbing eventually. Jacquie",

      "Content": "Yep I had incredible pain starting from my wrist all the way up my arm into my back and then across my side. It was almost as if someone had used me as a punching bag. My veins in my arm felt like cords rather than veins. They thought I had sepsis but luckily it wasn't. I also ended up with abscess on my backside and throat ulcers again but funnily no temp. Urine infection. No nausea until I started taking antibiotics. I think it is a cumulative effect, I know I did not want to get out of bed as the pain was horrendous. My husband bought me a tiny heated blanket I could put on my back from Boots which helped but I really only felt better when antibiotics kicked in. My arm is still sore and corded but nothing like it was. I'm starting tax next is it as bad as FEC? Jacquiexxx",
