    "Content": "Hi Gummybear, I have been getting herceptin injections and this afternoon is my second last one,due to finish April 20th. I have been ok so far,tired and weight gain has been my issues but not sure if it\u2019s herceptin alone or due to the chemo and radiotherapy,I\u2019m also on tamoxifen. I\u2019ve developed high blood pressure but it seems to be getting better. It\u2019s just a hell of a rollercoaster. Have a nice Easter weekend xx",
