    "Content": "Hi Marmar. I am almost 6 months post chemo now and suffering from awful aching joints, much worse first thing in the morning and after sitting or being inactive for a while. I am on Herceptin for another six months and am sure this is a contributory factor, you don't mention if you are having any other treatment, but am sure,as the others have said, hormonal therapies contribute to this too. My onc isn't concerned and seems to think it is still the effects of the chemo, I have a friend who says her aches and fatigue lasted for a year post chemo. Oddly I find exercise helps, which I know is difficult, but gentle swimming is great, even just floating in the water helps, I have a Pilates ball that I sit on and watch tv, I find gentle stretching on this is good too. Hope this is of some use. Much love , luck and happiness Fiona.x",
