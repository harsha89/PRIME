      "Content": "Hi Penny, I had a core biopsy when I was recalled for a second mamogramme. I was told that there was a concern about my mamogramme and that a core biopsy was needed to find out if it was breast cancer. I know how it feels to be waiting for results, I waited 10 days. I can't say anything that will stop you worrying, but I'm thinking of you and hoping that things go well for you. Liz.",
