Mine was halted after the first chemo in June, following sepsis and recommenced post surgery in Sept. The chemo nurses and my Onc say it\u2019s a common thing to have a short break so if that\u2019s what you want then bring it up and ask the question :-) Good Luck and fingers crossed for no more hospital visits!!.. for both of us!!  Jackie xx",

      "Content": "Well I can\u2019t believe I made it this far, I had  chemo 6 of 6 yesterday! 3 FEC and 3 T. I can\u2019t say which was worse, I had horrific side effects with both, and I\u2019m still apprehensively waiting for the Tax Truck to arrive again on Saturday!  We looked a right pair in the chemo suite, determined to try and reduce various side effects! I sucked on ice cubes the whole time, to avoid the mouth ulcers (worked great so far) and had my bare feet on frozen sweet corn and peas and my hands on frozen ice pods to help prevent Palmer Planter Erythrodysesthesia and reduce neuropathy! I had severe heel pain and unable to walk for 4 days in round 1 of T, but reduced dose and a ton of cream and reduced walking paid off in round 2. I now have a large, but dry, skin blister on my right heel.. Id put piccys up but I only use my phone to post! On T round 2 I also suffered a week of slightly swollen bright burning red itchy cheeks from day 9 for 7 days. Nothing would help neither piriton nor cream. The chemo nurses and Onc hadn\u2019t heard of this side effect before, so I\u2019m interested to hear if anyone else had it? I reckon it was similar to the heel issue, so we also pressed cold packs to my cheeks during chemo, I don\u2019t care how silly I looked LOL  I finally had a chemo round with no A&E visits last time and I desperately hope that\u2019s the same this time!! I\u2019m also so done with the flippin nose bleeds! I have my extra steroids, lenograstim injections, gabapentin, Loratadine, lansaprozole etc and this time I have some added tongue drops and pills for when my tongue goes white and the burning down my oesophagus!  Fingers crossed that the major side effects are finished by Christmas Day so I can enjoy my dinner and taste it, oh and be able to cut it up as I\u2019m struggling with using a knife in my right hand!  \u2018Just\u2019 axillary node clearance surgery in Jan and radiotherapy to go, I can\u2019t believe this awful ordeal lasts a whole year! But looking forward to Christmas :-)  Jackie x",

When we are in the midst of chemo, it really seems like forever doesn\u2019t it and each day or hour that passes when we feel rubbish can bring us down very low and you just can\u2019t imagine feeling well or that it will actually pass, it does every time and this will be the same and this time next week you will be a different person I\u2019m sure of it!!!  I don\u2019t know if you have a PICC line or not but that gave me a weekly opportunity to speak to the chemo nurses when it was being flushed, so I got hold of some Gabapentin much earlier than when I saw my Onc, so I could start it a week before my second cycle, you could call them and let them know you are in a lot of pain and need something stronger/different, I\u2019m sure they will help!  One more injection to go tomorrow thank goodness, that also marks a turning point in wellness :-)  Keep going buddy xxx",

      "Content": "Fantastic news HopeRu :-) It\u2019s been a long 11 days!! It always feels like you\u2019ll never feel better again then suddenly you do :-) and with enough time to get into the Christmas spirit!  I found there is definitely a set of week one side effects and a different set for week two. The nose bleeds always started in week 2 for me and they only stopped a few days before my next chemo! The tingling in my fingers started in round one and subsided towards the next chemo, but it has got progressively worse with each round and this last round it has been quite bad. I can\u2019t do anything that requires any dexterity or use of finger tips and fingers, it\u2019s quite frustrating! This round I have also found that I get nerve pulling sensation in my arms and legs, I dont really know how to describe it, kind of like youve over extended an arm or leg and you\u2019ve pulled on a nerve?! I\u2019m told these symptoms are very common and that for most people they recover but it might take a few months!  As well as nosebleeds the other week 2 side effect I\u2019m getting is streaming eyes, I look like Im crying all the time! And my eyes are a bit red and sore, again that always stops a few days before the next chemo! My lips also take a beating so I\u2019m using lots of lip cream as well! How is your mouth doing? I found that week one my tongue goes white and taste goes and week 2 the colour comes back but the inside of your mouth goes rough and takes a good few days to go smooth again and about now Day 12-14 it\u2019s feeling more normal again :-) my taste is still a bit off though!  I hope the cold is behaving and doesn\u2019t get a grip that\u2019s the last thing you need on top of this. It\u2019s s tricky season to have to go through chemo, everyone seems to have a cold!  I seem to have been spared the itchy hot face this round thank goodness!! So I reckon the cold packs did work after all :-) Somehow I have managed to keep some eyebrows and upper eyelashes although I\u2019m tempting fate by saying that ha-ha I had threatened to use a Pritt Stick to keep them in place ha-ha  My heels are currently in a right state, the giant blisters that formed after the awful Palmar-Planter symptoms in round 1 are now peeling off, fortunately there are no open areas so I\u2019m slapping more cream on and being very careful about keeping them covered.  I\u2019m now on the count down to Wednesday!!! 3 days to my next blood test AND hopefully if all is OK the removal of the PICC line!!! It\u2019s been in since my first chemo way back st the beginning of June!! I also get to see the surgeon to discuss my second surgery!  Jackie xx",

      "Content": "Hi HopeRu For the T part, I was told to take the steroids in the morning and evening with food and exactly 12hrs apart to give the best coverage, this does mean that you are taking a dose in the evening which may keep you awake, but I\u2019d rather that and have a better spread out dose! I took them the day before, the day of chemo and the day after. For cycle 2 I needed extra and had two more days of a lower dose and will do again for cycle 3. I had severe side effects and found the normal painkillers weren\u2019t strong enough and had Gabapentin for cycle 2. You have to start it a week in advance to get it in your system.  T, unlike FEC, typically doesn\u2019t make you feel nauseous but it can do. I was told to take 1x8mg  ondansetron tab before the chemo and also we are still given the 3 day Emend Aprepritant course. However, I had awful nausea with FEC which persisted for 2-2.5weeks each cycle and I have suffered no nausea at all on T (thank goodness!). I sucked ice cubes (with a bit of juice in) the whole time it was having T and also had my hands on ice packs, to help prevent mouth sores and and also reduce potential neuropathy. I was also told to keep my hands as still as possible as there was anecdotal evidence to suggest that helps reduce it too.  I was also told to wear dark nail polish to help reduce UV light getting to your nails as T can damage them. I also wear a thin pair of black gloves when I go out!  Lastly, I use lots of thick moisturiser, I found I shed a layer of skin each cycle like after you\u2019ve had a sun tan.  Best of luck for next week, I hope you have minimal side effects :-) I have my final dose on Wednesday!  Jackie x",

      "Content": "Awe HopeRu :-( I\u2019m so sorry you clearly have taken a mighty whack from the Tax Truck!! I TOTALLY know what you are going through, that first one really was utterly brutal but IT WILL PASS!!!! I have found the first painful set of side effects declined after a week as you say, when you stop the injections, but I had a few days were it was excruciating, I\u2019d say you need gabapentin!! Ask your chemo nurses for it, start taking it straight away I\u2019m on x3 a day through this painful bit and then stay on a maintenance dose all the way through just upping it for this bad week. It takes a while to build up in your system and you feel a bit drunk and dozy at first but that wears off. It\u2019s worth it!! Write down every side effect and tell your Onc, there is room to reduce the dose without compromising your prognosis, that has made a massive difference to me! I have zero taste this first week as well, my tongue goes white and swollen along with my throat! I\u2019ve tried the Nystatin tongue drops but they haven\u2019t made any difference! But, this happened in both the last two cycles and each time the tongue starts to recover after a week!  My nose was also bloody as you have described but it was only in the second week I started to get nose bleeds! They stopped, both times, at the end of 3 weeks just prior to next chemo.  Is your face red hot and itchy or just very bad hot flushes as they are also a nightmare at the mo! I tried everything on my face but nothing worked, but some little frozen ice packs bring a bit of relief!  My fingers and toes and hands and nails are also numb but tingly and I\u2019m struggling to use them, that did improve towards the end of each cycle.  I really feel for you and wish I could reach out and give you a hug! This part is so so miserable BUT based on my last two cycles I am convinced we will be feeling so much better in two weeks, just hang on in there one day at a time! we will enjoy our Christmas!  Keep talking and venting on here and let us know how you\u2019re doing!

Until this week I had been bobbing along ok despite having started chemo, had one round, developed a tooth abscess which resulted in neutropenic sepsis and ended up in hospital for a week and the tooth being pulled out. It was deemed too dangerous for chemo to continue so in the meantime they changed my treatment plan and I suddenly find myself facing surgery instead. During the course of the last week my mental state has taken a nose dive and I've been scared and low and frightened of the life changing surgery that is to come. It's made me feel depressed, angry and very anxious. I just can't seem switch into positive mode no matter what I do! I would much prefer to be in a state of denial.

      "Content": "Firstly, what a nightmare being passed around like that! I found it very unsettling when I had to switch surgeons after developing a rapport with my first one!  I would definitely opt for surgery 1st! Unfortunately, I wasn't given that option and wasn't aware I could challenge it, so my plan was supposed to be chemo first. At the original testing stage the ultrasound showed no indication of spread to the lymph nodes and all was quite positive. I had 3 tumours; one 21mm and two smaller ones only 3mm each. I was told I would need a mastectomy regardless of whether chemo shrunk them or not. So I started chemo FEC-T and had one round. Sadly I developed a wisdom tooth abcess which resulted in serious infection (sepsis) and I was hospitalised for a week and had to have the tooth out. Chemo was stopped as it was too dangerous for me to continue at that point. I then had several weeks to recover while they scheduled me for surgery instead. I had my mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy 2 weeks ago. The results are that 3months on from diagnosis the tumours had grown to 24mm and the two tiny ones had coalesced into one 16mm tumour and the cancer has spread to my lymph nodes, I am now having scans to see if it has spread elsewhere in my body and I will need more surgery to remove all of my lymph nodes. I truly feel that chemo first is a dangerous option. a) chemo is an unknown quantity and effects everyone individually, in some cases it may not even work on your cancer because we don't do DNA sequencing of the tumours to determine what definitely will and won't work! Therefore it may allow the cancer to grow and spread b) if there are complications with chemo it is delayed or stopped for periods of time, as in my case, also allowing an aggressive cancer to grow and spread.  Cut the damn thing out as early as possible, then whack it with chemo! That would be my advice and I wish I had been given that option at the start as surgery first seems the most sensible and logical option to me!  Jackie",

      "Content": "Hi Mimi Yes I\u2019ve had surgery, mastectomy in July sadly it has spread to my lymph nodes so I will require more surgery after chemo and radiotherapy :-(  With T, one of the potential side effects is peripheral neuropathy which is damage to your nerves in your hands and feet, to help prevent this some people try and ice them during chemo to prevent a high dose of T getting to their hands and feet. It\u2019s common practise in the US and some NHS trusts and private do it here. It\u2019s  the same principle as the cold cap to prevent hair loss, it\u2019s not a guarantee, but I swear it has saved my hands and sucking on ice helps prevent your mouth from sores and ulcers etc I didn\u2019t ice my feet and I\u2019ve had really bad palmar-plantar problems in my heels and have not been able to walk properly, so I will be icing hands, feet and mouth next time! We take a cool bag and I use my bunnies frozen ice pods (they use them in the summer :-)) and the ice cube bags which are a good size for your mouth, I add a bit of squash for flavour, and for my feet I will be taking some value/smart price frozen peas I\u2019m gonna look a right numpty but I don\u2019t care ha-ha-ha  I was doing a half hour walk every day to try and boost my mood but I haven\u2019t been able to do that and next cycle I am going to stay off my feet as much as possible for the first week, until the chemo in my body has significantly reduced. I\u2019ve also noticed my temp is elevated a lot more and on speaking to others that seems to be quite typical. So keep a good check on your temp, mine reached the 37.5 and resulted in an A&E visit but was just a spiking temp, but best to be on the safe side!  I have had a lot of side effects with this one and I\u2019m happy to discuss if you want or when and if you get any, but fingers crossed you won\u2019t get them :-)  Jackie xx",

My chemo team said that is perfectly OK and my GP prescribed it for me.  Keep telling yourself you are 2 chemos down, you know what to expect with FEC and this will mean you are half way through and this will be the last FEC, something to smile about, no more red juice!! :-) I always tell anyone taking my blood pressure that they cannot use my left arm and only offer them my right one, not all nurses will know that so it\u2019s perfectly OK to tell them.  As far as veins are concerned they do take a beating with chemo and blood tests etc you can ask to have a PICC line or a port fitted. I had one fitted before I started chemo because I am needle phobic and because I wanted to preserve the veins on my right arm. The chemo nurses are trained to fit PICC lines its a quick painless procedure, where they locate a suitable vein in your upper arm and insert a tube along it and the end is fitted with a little port device that they can put the chemo through, take bloods etc and you don\u2019t feel a thing it\u2019s great! The only down side is you need to have it flushed with saline each week and redressed, they remove it after your last chemo. The other device is a PORT which works the same way but is situated in your chest. The majority I\u2019ve seen are PICC lines. If you are really stressed and you think this may help, phone your chemo team and ask if they can fit you one ASAP (((Hugs))) Jackie xx",

It\u2019s such a pain, spontaneous nose bleeds at any time of the day or night and a sore bloody nose that gets crusty blood scabs that you darent blow as it will bleed again grrr The only issue is if it won\u2019t stop bleeding so it\u2019s an A&E visit to check platelet count!

      "Content": "PICC lines are fantastic to have all chemo and bloods through, but a pain in the bum if you are sporty and active! I have been very very cautious with mine, but owing to a hiccup in treatment I had to stop chemo and have surgery before resuming chemo, they kept the PICC line in and it has hampered even my basic arm exercises post surgery! Even doing them gently the line has wriggled out 5cm! Which is now borderline for use. I\u2019d defo consider the portacath as Toxophilite said and also agree, maintaining some of your normal physical activity is so so important for mental wellbeing during chemo and the rest of treatment!  Jackie x",

The most common one is the bone ache, mine is in my thighs, others have it in sternum and hips etc My aches last beyond the period I take the injections for and subside gradually. The worst side effects I get with them is the ache and tenderness around my neck and shoulders which subsided during the first week but is very unpleasant! I didn\u2019t get stomach cramps with mine, are you sure that\u2019s not the chemo? Some chemo is renowned for causing cramps and diarrhoea!  As unpleasant as the injections are, its definitely worth putting up with for athe added protection, that\u2019s what I told myself! Hope your next round is kinder  Jackie xx",

I can see from searching there are rather a lot, it would be great if we could list them and do a poll to see which are the worst offenders. I've tried: Relonchem - SEs - fatigue, pmt like moods, deep hot flushes Wockhardt - SEs - significant eyesight change to long and near sight, aching painful joints, (more energy, reduced hot flushes, better mood)   What shall I try next, I cant survive a month on Relonchem so I want to phone the pharmacist and ask if he can order in something else ASAP.

      "Content": "Following my mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy, despite being clinically negative at diagnosis (not visible in ultrasound or by feel) 2/5 nodes had small tumours. So I was told, following chemo, I would require axillary node clearance and then radiotherapy!  I have emotionally assimilated the cancer diagnosis and I am not bothered by being a baldy with no left boob BUT I cannot come to terms with requiring a full node clearance?! After a small amount of research it seems there are clinical trials underway to see if radiotherapy is just as good for long term prognosis as surgery and clearance! Radiotherapy also has the added benefit of a reduced risk of lymphodema which is ultimately my main concern as well as the fact i can not physically tolerate any more numb patches!  Please can I have thoughts on this? My Onc isn\u2019t one for discussion and I don\u2019t trust him to really consider what is best for me personally from a psychological and physical perspective; I\u2019m just another number on his conveyor belt!  Does radiotherapy destroy nerves as much as having them cut in surgery? Will I still be numb regardless of which treatment I have? Will my lymph system still function if I only have radiotherapy? Any info gratefully received :-)  Thanks Jackie",
