    "Content": "Hi JammyR, I had FEC-T and also had an itchy scalp soon after my first chemo with the cold cap. They used a spray conditioner on my hair before putting the cold cap on and I thought that it was probably that which made my scalp itchy. My head was very sensitive to some shampoos so only used the Simple range which helped a little but still quite itchy. I had my last chemo at the end of October last year and the top of my scalp still itches, possibly my hair growing back.Â  Good luck with the rest of your treatment and hope the itching subsides.",
