      "Content": "It's two and a half years since I had a breast cancer diagnosis, swiftly followed by a single mastectomy and tamoxifen prescription. Having more or less just 'got on with things' since then (barring all the horrible Tamoxifen side effects) I have found myself depressed and anxious over the last few months. I have seen my GP about the depression and am working on that but the other thing is that I seem to spend a lot of the time feeling really scared. I did have an ovarian cancer scare last year, and I don't know how much that has contributed to this feeling, but I am terrified that I have a form of secondary cancer that I don't know about, and paranoid that death must be imminent! I know this isn't rational but it's doing my head in. Does anyone have any advice?",

      "Content": "Thank you both so much for your wise words and support. Anna, I think you've hit the nail on the head - I feel this luck can't last, like it's all got to catch up with me at some stage. My overwhelming feeling when it all happened was that I was so very lucky. I had the cancer in 2 places so was given a mastectomy and was told that chemo was pretty inevitable but then the lymph nodes came back OK and I escaped that horror. And whereas I knew of people who had changed their lives dramatically after a cancer diagnosis (life's too short to put up with this job / marriage etc) I just counted my blessings and thought how lucky I was to have my husband and children, my family, my job and my colleagues, my friends.... So, I think, Maggie, that I am a pretty positive person generally. I do feel completely worn down by 2 years of tamoxifen, though.  I am still battling with fatigue and get what feels like morning sickness quite often, among other things. As a result I find it harder to put as much into my job - I'm a teacher, and have always felt quite passionate about what I do but now it often just feels like masses of work stacked up that I don't have the energy for. I also feel a bit that I don't have a right to feel so fed up about all that as I have kind of 'got away with it', somehow cheated the cancer, whereas there are so many people right in the thick of it and facing much more real problems. I'm not sure how much the fear and paranoia are symptoms of the depression. I've started taking Citalopram now, (which is making me even more tired and  nauseous!) but I do feel more steady. My doctor has referred me for counselling but there's a 3 month wait. Interestingly, the doctor said that there is now evidence that SSRI inhibitor anti-depressants help with menopausal symptoms such as flushes and mood swings Thank you for listening!",

      "Content": "When I had my diagnosis 2 years ago the cancer was in 2 places on my left breast and so that was an immediate mastectomy. My gut instinct was to just take them both, like you say, for peace of mind. From a cosmetic point of view I also thought it would be easier to have two new ones, rather than one that stayed the same and one that could fluctuate with weight changes etc (I had a friend who'd experienced this). My husband and surgeon talked me out of a double mastectomy, although the surgeon would have allowed it if I'd really wanted it.What convinced me in the end was that having cancer in one breast doesn't give a higher risk of developing cancer in the other one. If the cancer came back it would be just as likely to be in a different part of the body. I can see why they might want you to wait or to have a psychological assessment. I'm glad now that I still have one 'real' boob. Everything else aside, it's nice to have one that has sensation - you're still young, do you want to lose that? At the moment it probably feels like you'll do anything to avoid the cancer coming back but it is worth remembering that you will get over this and that at some point normal life will resume. xxx",
