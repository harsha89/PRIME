      "Content": "Hello Karen I know what you mean about having a bra that is easy to open.  I shall take note and Wear my front fastening bra when I begin radiotherapy.  It's whatever you are comfortable with at the end of the day.  I don't think I will return to underwire bras again.   Well I am 51 but it does make you feel better when you feel sexyou and attractive, even if you are not going to have anything on display.  What is a control mammogram?  It's all so new and can be scary.  I try to be brave and not think of the C word, just refer to it as a lump needing to be removed.  I have histology next Friday and I am anoxious about that.  Hoping as we all would be that all was removed with good clearance and that sentinel lymph nodes are clear.   Good luck with your mammogram and let me know how things go for you. Best wishes - love Lorraine xx",
