      "Content": "I too had a lumpectomy in July 2013 with chemo and rads. At my first mammogram following treatment little calcified lumps were detected and following a lumpectomy it was decided I needed a mx. I was like you extremely worried and scared as to how it had come back so soon.  I am seeing a Macmillan counsellor as I'm finding it very hard to cope. Please seek help from your breast care nurse and ask if this service runs in your area. It does help even if some weeks I just sit and cry.  Good luck in your journey xx",
