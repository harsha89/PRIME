I\u2019ve lost soo many family members to cancer so I allways associate this with a bad ending. Hopefully the scans will be clear , thankyou for all your replies it\u2019s definitely helped a lot. ",

Ive been told I\u2019ll also have a full axillary clearance when they operate. I didn\u2019t use the cold cap but to be honest loosing my hair wasn\u2019t half as traumatic as I was expecting, I have got a wig which I wear when I go out, and just wear a hat around the house  Lynn ",

When the lady was doing the scan she said she needed to take pictures of the sides of my ribs too as I had my arms by my side. I asked her if that was normal and she just said it will be more active there because if yesterday, does that mean she found something? ",
