      "Content": "Thanks Rob I think I'll need to invest in a couple of wide brim hats if this hot weather continues. Purplefox, sorry I didn't make my post clear, you're right they said just avoid on areas that's getting the radiation but in my case this includes my neck, unless I wear a polo neck (bit hot for that) i will almost definitely get burnt! I'm so early on in the radiotherapy I thought it might be ok to use suncream on the affected area, maybe lesser of the two evils.",

I just don't know how it's gonnae go because I've already had reconstruction. I'm already booked in for radiotherapy in two weeks time.",

Don't have full details yet as not meeting the surgeon until Wednesday. He was originally happy with the pathology report but its another member of the team that's not.",

It's probably a seroma, i had one under my arm after my lymph node clearance & mastectomy, it felt as hard as an egg but to reasure me they did an ultrasound and then drained it. Hope this helps",
