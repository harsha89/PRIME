      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am 40 years old and recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I am undergoing FEC-T chemotherapy at the moment and will be having surgery sometime in April. I am having genetic testing for the BRACA gene as my mum died of ovarian cancer (diagnosed age 55) and my aunt died of breast cancer (diagnosed early 40s). I have to decide quite quickly what surgery I will be having done. Is there anyone out there who is/has been in the same position? Question - Would you have lumpectomy and radiotherapy or double masectomy?",

      "Content": "Hi All I had a double mastectomy 3 weeks ago and although I have no pain where the scars are I do have pain in the centre of my chest.  It feels like a burning sensation or rubbed raw type of thing.  Have any of you experienced this or is it just me?  Any suggestions of how to get rid of it would be appreciated.  Regards Gail",
