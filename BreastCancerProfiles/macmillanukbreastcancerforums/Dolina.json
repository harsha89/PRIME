      "Content": "Hi I hate to be long winded but the full story has to be told so you can tell me if you can help or not. January 2016 diagnosed with 15mm idc in left breast, lumpectomy and 4 nodes removed.  Nodes clear but no clear margins, a further 3 operations and still no clear margins so mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction in June 2016.  No chemo or radiotherapy necessary, just tamoxifen. December 2017 I felt a lump under left arm pit, lump nothing but a cyst but biopsy of lymph node taken and positive cancer cells detected.  Ct scan clear, so just complete lymph node clearance, still waiting on pathology, should be next week.  But question is does anyone else had this after lymph nodes said to be all clear previously, if so what treatment did you get?   I am really concerned that I will never truly relax and never really trust the results. Thanks  Dolina",

Sorry ladies and gents I am at a pity party, please don\u2019t join me. Dolina xx Good sleep everyone x",

There has to be a plus to all this and that is it.  I would definitely have this surgery again, with out question, it's the best decision I made.  I no longer have cancer, did not need radiotherapy because there was nothing left to zap and am a firm believer in our wonderful NHS system Take care and all the very best Nicky, I hope this helps little bit Dolina xx",

Take care Skye and get better soon.",

My mastectomy was in June and I just want to forget this and move on but my brain won't let me.  Has anybody else had this, I feel I am going mad, why can't I just let it go?

The ultrasound bloke told me I had a very small hernia and that was the source of the pain.  I got my appointment to discuss the results with the plastic surgeon and its in the middle of December, which to be honest was a bit of a shock as I am in pain constantly so I phoned the hospital and explained I was in pain and needed an earlier appointment and I was told there were no earlier appointments.  To be honest I really don't mean to be a wimp but I just don't know what to do, I am still taking Tramadol for the pain, these were prescribed for the reconstruction op.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
