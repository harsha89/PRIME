      "Content": "Hi all Normally I know with triple negative you do not get hormone treatment after chemo and radiotherapy, but when talking to my oncologist about my hormone results and how they determine PR levels she looked into my notes and said they use a scoring system based on your ER levels. When looking at my notes she said that my ER levels were actually a high negative (180), they are given a score out of 300, something which my surgeon had given her the impression I was a low negative, and my scoring would not have been looked into again, unless I asked. So on looking at this she has decided to put me on a course of tamoxifen because of the high negative. Just thought I\u2019d share, so that if you are told you are triple negative, you can maybe have a look at your results and ask for tamoxifen, if you too are a high negative. It may not make the world of difference % wise, but to me a smidge of extra hope is a lot as im 26 and planning a super long life! Chemo finally finished, lots of hair on my head still and just 4 weeks of rads, right smack bang in the middle of the school summer hols.",

      "Content": "I have just posted in lillieloulou\u2019s, I have had my lumpectomy and node clearance 2 weeks ago.  Waiting is the most difficult thing, the complete unknown. I\u2019m not sure how I got through waiting, no real technique, I just allowed my emotions to show, and I talked about it. When I did get my results back, my doctor ended my appointment with, technically speaking you don\u2019t have cancer now, treatments are now just a preventative, as all margins where clear and no nodes affected, so I\u2019ll see you next year! So yes I was pretty happy with that. But now im waiting again, to find out the details of what I will be hit with next! I find reading posts on here helps too, so many inspirational people, and good advice. Take each part, step by step, and try not to rush your thoughts too much, and then move on to the next part.  You will find your way through. Josie x",

I had a grade 3 tumour too and have just finished 3 rounds of Fec and about to start T on Monday. I still have mostly a full head of hair, minus bold patched above my ears a on the top of my head which is easily covered with a head band.",

No one mentioned to me about any problems that can occur with wearing them, so i would just do what you feel best, and maybe invest in some eye drops or spray just in case! x",

      "Content": "I too used the cold cap, and have had 3x fec so far. I completely agree with all the advice above too. I also take a blanket with me and after about 20 mins, i don't even notice the coldness of the cap. So far its worked OK with me, i have lost hair, above my ears, and a lovely patch right at the front on top of my head, which i cover with a thick head band.  i did have very thick long hair to start, and never got my hair cut or thinned out prior to the cold cap, maybe that's the reason for the hair loss i have.  My advice is to give it a go, if it doesn't work or you don't like it, at least u can be happy you gave it a shot.  Also the research i found was that it works for about 80-85% of the time, not sure if thats right though.  Good luck xxx",
