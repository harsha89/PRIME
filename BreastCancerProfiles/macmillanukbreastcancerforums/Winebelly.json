      "Content": "I'm still on weekly Taxol so can't comment on Herceptin on it's own. However I have definitely felt worse on the Herceptin weeks, really floored, headaches and guaranteed return to diarrhoea and stomach pain. My onco advised taking paracetamol day before and for several days after. It helped a bit but I don't like to keep taking drugs if I can help it. Hope you feel better soon. ",

      "Content": "Its been a roller coaster few months following invite for early screening (thank the goddesses), going from WLE for DCIS to another WLE for small invasive grade 2, then being told I've surprised them again as her2+ve so will now need 12 weekly taxol, Herceptin then radiotherapy and tamoxifen. It's a lot to take in but I know I'm in a good position as caught early and trying to stay positive. I'm wondering if I will be ok to work during chemo as low dose, and would keep love to get back to running after 2 month gap due to surgeries but don't want to be unrealistic or set myself up to fail. Have checked out some old posts and seem to be positive. Hard to get my head round that I have to have chemo in order to have Herceptin. ",

      "Content": "Hello I'm on weekly Taxol and have very thick hair and lots of it. The woman who made my wig appointment said I wouldn't have hair by the time the appointment came around (about 3 weeks into treatment) and to bring a photo. Nine weeks later I still have hair! I always wear it short so no drastic change pre treatment. It started to moult after week 2 and continues to come out weekly and is noticeably thinner particularly on the crown and sides but I'm just about getting away with it so much so that if I can ride out the last 3 weeks I may be able to get avoid the shave. It has stopped growing, is dry and listless and the grey is hanging in the most! It's been quite an obsession and I have swung week to week as to whether to get rid, and constantly pulling at it. The upside is that unwanted facial hair dropped out in the first week and stayed away so no plucking or waxing required! It's a hard call on the shave, part of me thought just do it so I wasn't obsessing all the time and to stop itching and sore head. Good luck with whatever you choose",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm wondering what to expect with hair loss and feel I might be reaching the stage where I need to bite the bullet and shave it off or if I should carry on hanging in there. I have incredibly thick hair, and lots of it which is why I wear it short anyway. I'm on week 5 of weekly Taxol in low dose and Herceptin, so 2nd week of cycle 2 and my hair is coming out in handfuls and has been for a week. It did start shedding in week 2 but nowhere near this, I've probably lost a good third but evenly distributed. But if you didn't know me you wouldn't notice as I still have a good head of hair (although it now moves in the wind which I've never experienced in my life, quite a nice feeling!) My dilemma is I can't leave it alone and want the loose out and I only need to look at it and it seems to fall out, it's constantly falling on my neck and clothes so irritating. And at times my scalp is quite sore. I know there's no right answer as we all react differently but I would really appreciate hearing about other people's experience on weekly Taxol. I've not needed any other chemo so really don't know what to expect. I'm wondering if I should let it go so Im not wondering about it all the time or if I should just get a grip and see...",

      "Content": "Hi I started weekly taxol (and Her Elton!) - a few weeks back. I wasn't offered a picc line so weekly blood tests and cannula as normal but hasn't been an issue so far. The first week was the worst I think as body getting used to it and maybe the injection, will know more when I have 2nd injection this week.  Main problem was diarrhoea first week but not had since, exactly the opposite now! There's a couple of days each week I'm a bit floored then picks up before it starts over again. I was able to go back to work part time this week. Just don't push it too much at the start, take it easy -  hope it goes well",

      "Content": "Hi Karen. Interesting they are putting choice onto you. Both my breastcare surgeon and then oncologist said I would be going onto Tamoxifen post chemo, no mention of any other option. I just turned 48 whilst going through treatment, had possibly started to be peri menopausal before diagnosis although had fell back into routine periods after months of irregular. I had my last period the second week of 12 weekly taxols in October, nothing since and Im due to start Tamoxifen next week. I will start and discuss with oncologist in Feb after I judge any effects. I'm already having bad hot flushes and day and night sweats so hope they dont get worse as they are already doing my head in! Good luck with your decision.",
