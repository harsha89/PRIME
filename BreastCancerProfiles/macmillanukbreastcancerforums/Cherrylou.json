      "Content": "Hi ! I have been diagnosed with malignant phyllodes tumour and will be having a double mastectomy on June 11th. I have seen quite a few camisole type tops with pouches to hold drains, but they only seem to be available in the U.S. Can anyone provide any advice on whether and where they are available in the UK, or offer any advice on clothing. I'm very anxious about the surgery and I think anything that may make it easier when I'm recovering might help ????? Thanks Louise x",
