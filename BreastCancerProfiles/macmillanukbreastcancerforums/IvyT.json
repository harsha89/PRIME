      "Content": "Oh Lin you are in no way a wimp, you are a strong, brave lady.  I've been very down this evening and came on and saw your post which rang so true in many ways with me. I had my last cycle of T last week and feel awful with s/e. Everyone keep saying to me I look great and expecting me to be bouncing around like Tigger...if only!  I explain that whilst I'm happy to have chemo finished I still have a way to go with op and radiotherapy and s/e still affecting me and will to some extent for a while. I then feel guilty because I sound like I'm moaning. I had my after chemo scans this morning and all I got from my sister tonight was a text with ' how were scans'? It really hurt that she didn't even just call..which then makes me feel selfish.  My dad passed away from cancer 2 days after I was diagnosed and tonight more than ever I want to speak to him because he went through it all and would understand. I miss him so much.  Hugest hugs to you and everyone else...we are amazing and I cannot say how good it is to let rip on this forum and know people understand and won't judge. T Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I can do library at Drumbrae or happy to meet elsewhere near Western also. Ive been working through where possible as had just changed jobs before diagnosis and am on a temporary contract til end March when due to go permanent so don't get paid if I don't work at moment. Luckily my employer been great so getting time away to meet up not a problem. Aspen, we look like we are indeed on the same plan of treatment. I have felt fine with T part really just the niggley side effects  sore tongue/taste buds non existent, aching joints, dripping nose and the lethargy. Dose of T upped for cycle 2 but hard to say if it had an impact as that's when I caught the flu so have felt pretty rubbish this whole cycle.  Wednesday will be a long day for you and hope all goes well. I was in for just short of 8hrs for first T but met some lovely ladies and we just chatted for most of the time. You meet some really inspiring people on this journey which we are all on. Look forward to meeting you all soon. Sending huge hugs.  Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, hope you don't mind me joining in here but it'd be great to meet up with you ladies if something arranged as I too am in Edinburgh. It'd be good to speak to others in the same position as as much as I have a good support network of family and friends I feel sometimes I too put on a brave face to protect them when all I want to do is scream! I was diagnosed in Oct with Er HEr2+ with lymph node involvement and have completed 3 cycles of FEC and 2 cycles T with pertuzumab(which I needed to self fund) and herceptin. Hoping to have final cycle this Thursday if all good but suffered a bit of a blip this cycle and ended up in hospital with flu for a week but feel much better now so fingers crossed. Op to follow then RT and the usual ongoing injections. Be good to see you all. Sending hugs. Xx",
