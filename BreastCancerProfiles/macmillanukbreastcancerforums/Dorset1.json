    "Content": "Hi Staffylove. I am one year younger than you but I have a total different out look on it all.  I have stage 4 (incurable) lung cancer in both lungs and I have had 1 round of chemo which actually put me in hospital. I'm going to try it again next week. Which hospital are you under I ask because I'm at York and the MM centre there is absolutely full of leaflets about every thing you could think off even down to 4 day holiday break for £50. When I had my radiotherapy I had to travel to Leeds which could take up to an hour, I used the hospital transport and they were brill. Get your wig, put your face on and get out of the house. I don't mean to sound harsh but the point in telling just part of my journey is there is always someone with bigger problems. You can do this it is tough but so are we and we're all hear to help. Take care.xxx",
