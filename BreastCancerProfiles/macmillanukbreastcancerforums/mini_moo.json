Keeping positive about things and just going with things, is helping me along (along with my fab fianc√© and friends and family). Fingers crossed everything goes swimmingly tomorrow. Got various reading material, puzzle book and my future hubbie to distract me. Wish me luck :)",

      "Content": "Hiya Got my first chemo session tomorrow (FEC x3). I've prepared as much as I can with scarves, wigs, ginger biscuits, peppermint tea, sensitive lotions etc, extra nutritional food (although I have a balanced diet anyway), pineapple cubes freezing as I write to sooth mouth, anti-bacterial hand spray here and there, manuka honey for porridge and of course plenty of sleep for tonight. Might treat myself to a nice, long bath using bombs etc as skin may get too sensitive for things like that, not sure. Have fixed feeling about tomorrow. I'm a bit worried/scared just because I'm diving into the unknown. I hear you're ok first few days, have a slump in middle week and then perk up again in the last week. I'm also glad it's finally starting. First day of getting rid of what's inside me. So feel happy about that. We were thinking of going to Devon for some surfing end of July, which will be my third week after 1st session. Just wondering if I should risk it? My gut says go. As it's in the UK, if anything happens, I can go to A&E. But we were also thinking of going to my Dad's place in France, this will fall the third week after 2nd session. Hopefully we can get a cabin so don't have to be around lots of people who may have germs. His place is in the middle of nowhere, so not sure whether to risk it. Anyone else gone abroad? I've read that it's good to take notes of how you feel etc, so that when you see the Oncologist, you can then refer to your notes, which is an excellent idea. Just got my hair chopped yesterday to around the bottom of neck, when it was fairly long before. Was good to get the split ends off. Looks great too. Thought I'd better have it cut short seeing as I'll be losing it anyway. Great chance to experiment too. Anyway, this is where I'm at, at the mo. Happy but worried about what lies ahead after first chemo. It can just be all good right? As it's getting rid of the cancer. chelle xx",

But am worried after reading another post, that they might not be a good idea if the glue can rip what you have left off, eek! Let me know how the 'look good, feel great' session goes please, as I'm thinking of booking a session, mainly to be shown how to draw eyebrows on without looking fake (and the goody bag! lol). Does anyone know if you can book anytime, even before 1st chemo session? As I'd like to know how to do things, before I lose my eyebrows and get eyelash advice. chelle xx",

Reckon I'll lost at least 2 as when I press on them, I can see the nail lift. I did lose my big toe nail from out walking once, I bruised it against my boot. But luckily there was a little stump left at the bottom to attach a fake nail too. Took a good year for it to grow back though. When you lost your nails, are they gone completely? Did you stick fake ones one until the grew back? I've been discharged from Oncology now. So maybe I could give my breast care nurse a call to see what she thinks? I did mention that my fingertips were a bit sore to my Onc at the time, but she just prescribed stronger painkillers, which were mainly for my bones in my legs at the time as they got sore at some point. I'll look into those products SaxxyD, thanks for those :) x",

      "Content": "Hiya I've finished my 6 sessions of chemo (yes!), but since moving onto Docetaxil for the last 3 sessions, I've noticed my nails are changing appearance. I have put up with pain in my fingertips and toes from the last time round. I've noticed the nails aren't so much sore now, but half numb and feel dry. So going through a lot more hand cream than I would normally. But it's my nails that are concerning me. They are going dark pink then yellow, bit like blood vessels popping underneath first of all. The white tips of my nails are spreading downwards, so I now have massive white tips. Got some brown areas too in one or two nails, not very attractive. I'm worried they may just fall off, as.The 'yellow' bits look like the nails are starting to come away from the pink bits. :-/ I caught my longer thumb nail doing something. Usually this would be painful and you'd notice. But i didn't notice and it didn't hurt. Same for stubbing my little toe - hardly any pain when usually this would be sore. yes, it was tender, but not really painful. Shall I see the GP? Is this normal? Will my nails return to normal? Getting rather worried about them. Don't even like to show them. Think I'll cut them right down tonight so that I don't catch them and pull them off!",

      "Content": "Hello I'm a bit confused as to the process of sorting out a wig. I'm sure everything will become clear when I see the Oncologist for the first time on Tues. But would like real advice from people who have been there. I know I could get a voucher to buy a wig, the monetary value varies with each hospital. But at what stage to you get it styled? I know Toni & Guy do a scheme (nearest one to us is 30mins away). But wondering if you have to buy a long wig, which is then styled? As you can choose from lots of colours that T&G offer. Is it better to just buy an already styled synthetic wig? Guess I need to find out if my local hairdresser cuts wigs. Feel a bit funny asking. I've got a few scarves which I'm happy to wear in the meantime though if hair falls out before get wig sorted. Would prefer to get the wig sorted before it does though. If anyone has advice, I'd love to hear it. chelle xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I have fake bright red hair using XXL live (without bleaching hair first) and my natural colour is an auburn colour, (a browny-red colour). I see I won't be allowed to dye my hair again once chemo starts, which is only next week (July 11th). This means my roots will show through which doesn't look great. I'm having my hair chopped off from being long to a bob length to get used to shorter hair and would be able to handle it more when it starts falling out. I have found a hair colour remover (Adee Phelan) which is bleach and ammonia free, which is great as it won't damage my hair. I've just done the strand test and it comes out lighter than my natural hair colour, strips it of the fake red but looks more ginger now. I will have to put a light brown colour on top - which is more treatment. Now, do I go ahead, remove my colour then put more dye on top? Or do you think it would be better for my hair, just to leave it alone and it will probably all fall out anyway and any hair colour removal etc are wasted efforts and therefore weakening my hair cuticles? Please can anyone advice? I want my hair as strong as possible before chemo but also don't want to look rubbish while I might feel rubbish.",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a single mastectomy and auxillary clearance of nodes nearly 2 weeks ago. Everything went smoothly and I've not experienced any pain as yet. But now I have this seroma, it feels like I have my right breast back it's filled up that much with fluid. It's only uncomfortable at times, it's just 'there' really. I don't even need to wear the softie I was given as it looks like I have my breast back anyway. I'm hoping I can just put up with it. Feels more like pressure building than anything. I still do my arm exercises to keep mobile and rest as much as I can. Luckily I have a partner that does everything for me or won't let me do things. Although I have cooked a little. Frustrating when I want to do more. I'm just wondering at what stage you decide to have it drained? My surgeon said if I can avoid having it drained and just stick it out, it would save infection. I've read seromas can last weeks, months and in some cases a year. Do I just stick it out? I guess it's a judgment call. I wear a sports bra all the time now, even to bed, as I found after lying down and then getting up to the loo, I had to support my affected area as all the liquid moved and felt uncomfortable. It's much better with a bra now. Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions, it would prove useful. Thanks, chelle :)",
