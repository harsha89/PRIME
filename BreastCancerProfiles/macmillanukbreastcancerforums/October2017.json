      "Content": "Hi there after some advice please. My grandmother has been diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer 2-3 cm not in lymph nodes on scan she is over 90. She has opted not to have surgery for it and unlikely to have any other intervention.  Has anyone else experienced a friend/family member who has opted for this path? I have read triple negative can be aggressive.. I know everyone is different but after anyone advice /tips please what to look out for? (if that's even possible)  As well as continuing to enjoy the time we have together x  Thanks for reading ",

      "Content": "Thanks Carolyn hope you are OK too She's actually 94 which is fab, but yes I agree with you about her age and other possible causes. She's doing what's right for her which is fine ☺  I know you can't predict things in life in general but when I read aggressive it made me wonder.. I'm a big thinker!  Yes she likes her activities so hopefully there will be many more to come  Thanks   Xx",
