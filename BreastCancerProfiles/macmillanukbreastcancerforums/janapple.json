      "Content": "Hi Everybody,  I have just been reading all your posts with regard to the hair loss thing. I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma type 3 in March and had lumpectomy and sentinal biopsy 31st march. Have been waiting waiting waiting for appointment with the Oncologist which has finally come through for Monday. Dont know if I am going to have chemo but my consultants registrar said they had discussed it and is very likely. I am absolutely terrified! I know it sounds vain but I like my hair and am very depressed at the the thought that I might lose it. Have already researched Annabandanna and wigs etc which has helped but keep looking in the mirror and pulling my hair back to try and see what I will look like!! Anyway, your posts have cheered me up a bit, I suppose its just that I seem to be in limbo not knowing for certain what treatments I will have and my mind had just been running riot!! I'm sure once I have seen the oncologist I will be able to get my head round it and cope a bit better. Love to all you brave ladies   Janet xx  ",
