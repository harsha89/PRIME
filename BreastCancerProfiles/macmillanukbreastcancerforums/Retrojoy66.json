      "Content": "Hi all through my chemo which stopped bout 8weeks ago ,and up to date ( hair growth showing a little ) I have used Liz Earle shampoo . Just a tiny drop and then after drying my head I rub in some dry skin oil from the Jennifer Young Beauty Despite Cancer  site. Which tho not cheap seems to nourish it. The site has some excellent products and you can read about and ask questions on . They are very helpful . Hope you find something that works for you.  Good luck xx ",
