      "Content": "Hi Amanda, The injections for me, were a mixed bag. I have just had my 5th chemo a week ago (3 fec, 2 tax so far) and am on my 5th lot of injections. I've had them where I've just ached a bit, some where I've been in loads of pain, and some where I didn't notice any side effects at all! This time I've had pain, just for today, (after 3 injections) but it's been manageable. So I think its different for everyone. They suggested I have them last thing at night, so if you get problems straight away at least you can sleep through some of it! I just have one more chemo too, yours will fly by Hun. xxx",

Well, 2nd one. They  did lumpectomy and took 3 Lymph nodes in Sept, then I had to have bigger margins taken from the lump area, and axillary clearance of all nodes in October. So apart from Herceptin and Tamoxifen, should be finished soon. Good luck with the Surgeons appointment tomorrow. xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Improudofme, I think I would ring the BCN and see if she can chase anything up. Trouble is, if they get the machine fixed early I'm sure they won't tell people. So you just have to pester people. When I was first diagnosed I was waiting on the results of my MRI to tell me if I was going to have a lumpectomy or mastectomy. When I phoned them for results they just said \"your MRI was 'ok'.\" Didn't seem important to them that I was desperate to know what was going to happen next. My BCN had to bug the Consultant for an answer for me. (Fortunately I had a lumpectomy, but my lymph nodes were not clear, and I had to have chemo too.) So give them a ring today or tomorrow. Your BCN will be able to reassure you if nothing else. Take care xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Mary-Anne, I finished my chemo a few weeks ago, but struggled all the way through with dreadful heartburn/ gastric reflux. So painful at times, I imagined it to be like what angina would feel like. Like you I was already on Omeprazole. The Oncs changed it to Lansoprazole, twice a day (which is not the usual dose). When I had a particularly bad bought, nothing worked. Took gaviscon liquid, tums, and milk was soothing. The gaviscon double action tablets I think were the best. It seemed at its worst a couple days after chemo, and both types of chemo affected me, the fec and the docetaxel. I am still on the double dose of Lansoprazole, but am going to drop it to once a day as I have just finished my radiotherapy. (Radio gave me heartburn for the first few days too, although radiographers said it wasn't that). With all these meds, and I couldn't eat fruit, or drink alcohol, and still couldn't get rid of it, came to the conclusion I just had to struggle through. It wasn't every single day though, I did have good days, and there is light at the end of the tunnel... you will get through it! lots of love xxxx",

I had my hairdresser waiting to come and give me a razor cut, but she was unavailable until the next day. I couldn't bear the thought of it ending up all round the house, (worse than having a pet!), so I vacuumed it off! Used the small brush on the vacuum and got a lot of the loose hair off. Everyone has laughed about it. My hairdresser came and sorted it for me, then I shaved it completely. I think its something that you quickly get used to, apart from having a cold head! I didn't like my wig, too itchy, so wear lots of hats. My hair started to grow back when I started Docetaxel, but I'm 10 weeks finishing chemo and still have only a bit of fluff on my head. Its getting more every day though! Good luck for the rest of your treatment, you'll get there!! xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I was prescribed the injections right from the start because I was only 3 weeks post op when I started my chemo, and they thought I may have a problem with my breast wound. (I had a lumpectomy and it wasn't healing very quickly, unlike my axilla wound which healed a treat.) The first time I had the Injections I had a lot of pain in my chest and back, but oddly, the day after I finished having them. The second time wasn't so bad, then the third time I refused to have them because it was Christmas and I didn't want any symptoms over Crimbo. The last time I didn't have any symptoms at all, but my change to docetaxel chemo from fec, was so bad I don't think I noticed any other symptoms. Have just had my 5th chemo, and start injections again Sunday. My counts have been brill throughout, although I had an infection somewhere, last cycle, which didn't make me feel ill, but gave me a high temp which I had to be admitted for. I gave the injections myself, as they are really small preloaded syringes and don't hurt. The pains only lasted overnight or a day, and they suggest taking them before bed, so you can sleep through pain if you get it straight away.  I suppose it's really dependent on whether you need to get it all over and done with quickly or not? My son is getting married in May and I was hoping to have a bit of hair, so I wanted to get the chemo over with as quickly as possible. Don't think delays would have bothered me otherwise. You just get nice longer periods of feeling better. Hope this is helpful. xxx",

I just wondered if anyone has had the same problem with their veins in the past, and how long they take to recover. All the veins in my lower arm are sore, and when I stretch to get things from high shelves it hurts. Would be grateful if anyone has a timespan. Weeks or months? Thanks, xx",

Also I have full movement back in that arm, so ready for radiotherapy when it comes. Will try massage and stretches. Hopefully will work eventually. It worries me that if my veins on my good arm are too damaged, what happens if I ever need an infusion for something when I haven't got my picc anymore! I don't expect you to answer that, I'm just thinking out loud. Thanks for your reply, and hope you are feeling better now. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Gn'J, No it's definitely not cording, it's in my good arm, not my lymph node removal arm. I knew about the cording, and luckily have not had any problems in that arm at all. Even my movement is back to normal, ( I only had a lumpectomy and axilliary clearance). It's vein damage from the fec. Started chemo in November, and each of the 3 fec were painful going in. You can clearly see indented the veins they used, and they feel hard to the touch. The onc consultant said it was phlebitis initially. Hopefully time will reduce it. Yes looking forward to my last chemo being over with, radio to come, but that doesn't concern me at all. just time consuming. My son is getting married in May, so hoping that I've even got some hair growth started by then. You never know. Thanks for your reply anyway, and good luck on your journey through this awful pants time! xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Laney, I had my surgery, same as yours I think, lumpectomy and axillary clearance, back in October '14. After surgery I had that sensation for absolutely ages. The outer part of my arm that you rest on the bed, felt raw almost like a bad sunburn. Parts of it were numb, and still are, but to be honest that was a blessing compared to the soreness. I asked my surgeon about it in clinic follow up, and he said he has never seen anyone continue with permanent pain in the arm ( just the numbness might stay.) I am relieved to say he was right, and 3 months later I have no pain at all, and my arm movement is back to normal. ( I did do the exercises). I don't think it took the whole of that time to improve, I think I stopped noticing it being sore some time ago. I have had 5th of my 6 chemos yesterday, so light is at the end of the tunnel. It's not pleasant, and there have been some hiccups along the way, but it is definitely do-able. It's lovely to have support, The ladies on here all have some brilliant information and encouragement. Even if you don't feel the need to post, you can get answers to your queries from other peoples experiences and it is invaluable. Don't hesitate to ask foe help! Love and hugs xx",
