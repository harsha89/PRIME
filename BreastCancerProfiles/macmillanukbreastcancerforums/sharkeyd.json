    "Content": "Hi i am new to here. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June this year ar the end of my probationary teaching year ( i am 31 years old).   I thought i was dealing with everything ok - the surgery, reconstruction, but it is now all getting too much.   I have started feeling a dull ache (that's not always there) on my left side. it is a sort of tight, muscular feeling and the opp site from my surgery so i am soo worried. My oncologist had a feel before my last chemo and so did my GP last Friday and told me not to worry but i can't get it out of my head - what if this has spread! I know i am going through a blue patch. Everything is getting me down, i just throught this would be the year that me an my hubby would be starting a family in our new house, but instead i'm in total panic mode with a feeling of dread! I just need some advice how to shift the feeling. Denx",
