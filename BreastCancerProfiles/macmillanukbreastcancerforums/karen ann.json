I have been prescribed Gabapentin and Brufen for the pain. I have also been referred to the pain clinic and physio. Was starting to worry but luckily the bone scan I had was clear. If this pain is recent and constant please contact your doctor or CNN. They will be able to give you the advice, tests (if required) and pain relief. You have come so far and need to be able to do all the other exciting things that you now have a chance to do without pain. Let us know how you get on. I would say try not to worry, but after everything we have all been through it is not always so easy. Karen ",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer last November. I went to work and chose to tell my colleagues myself as planned to continue working for as long as possible. I told my colleagues as had been told I would lose my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes. Told my colleagues I would buy different coloured wigs to wear depending on my mood! My first chemotherapy session on Boxing Day!! I was lucky as my employer has been very supportive. I took an annual leave day after every treatment - 6 sessions. I have been given time to attend all of my appointments (had 60 appointments in all). I was able to work all the way through my chemotherapy with adapted duties. I work in a local authority social work dept. I had great support from management and colleagues. However had to go off sick after my last treatment (hit full up stage!!!). Chemotherapy successfully shrunk the tumour from 6cm to 0.5cm so was able to have lumpectomy. Returned to work on a phased return when told radiotherapy treatment would start earlier than thought. Tried to go to work in morning then radiotherapy sessions in PM but after 7 sessions had to go off sick again. I returned to work again on a phased return after another period of 7 weeks off again. I met with manager and HE who have agreed an extension of phased return. I have arranged to use some of my holidays left to reduce my working week for next month or so. As did not realise how tired and sore I would be. I am responsible for family income as husband gave up work to care for our 23 year old son who has special needs.  Although I have received great support from my employer one of my colleagues was diagnosed with bowel cancer. As she had over 4 months off ill she is not receiving the same support and is having to seek advice from the union. I have given the union rep the great information for employees and employers from McMillan cancer. One of suggestions is for a \"buddy system\"at work, I don't know if this is possible but may offer some support. I did not know that I am now classed as being disabled although cancer has gone. Please look at the information regarding the Disability Discrimination Act. Also contact your local authority as some have McMillan Money Matters advice teams. Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Rhonda I have been on Clonidine tablets for several months since the chemotherapy treatment brought on the menopause (was 47 so guess not deemed early). The tablets have helped immensely, although I still have occasional hot flushes they are not as often or uncomfortable. I take 2 tablets in the morning and at bedtime. I do not have any HRT as cancer was triple negative so do not know if taking anything else makes a difference. I do not think that I have suffered any of the side effects, though with all of the post treatment effects who would know! I would be worried how I would cope if the doctor said I had to stop taking them just now. But I am sure there will come a time when they decide that I am past the risk of the hot flushes happening. One of the annoying things about hot flushes is when they occur my hubby feels the need to tell me that they are occurring!! As if I would not notice myself!!! One of my colleagues said that as I am now \"better\" I should not have to keep taking these and my other tablets now!?? Good luck, I hope that they help. Take care K",

My nails were becoming stronger and returning to normal however I had painted my nails (with a colour I have used recently). When I took the polish off my nails are now bright yellow!! It looks terrible and no matter how often I wash or soak my nails it is not getting better. I know it sounds silly to be worrying about the colour of my nails after everything but it is just another visual thing reminding me that I am different. Any advice why this happened and what I can do to get them to return to normal. Thanks K.",

However on my first day back at work mid June I received a call to say my radiotherapy was starting early. I was able to attend work in morning then go to the Beatson for my radiotherapy treatment in the afternoon for the first 7 or 8 sessions before the tiredness hit me and I had to go back off work. It felt strange as the treatment seemed easy and I was in and out in 10 minutes but it was draining. I was fortunate that my GP practice has a voluntary drivers service who were great as I did not have to worry about the traveling to the hospital or parking. The advice from the radiotherapy staff and BCN was great. Take advice and let them know if you are having any problems. It has been a few months since all of my treatment finished but it strangely seems alot longer than this. Take care K",

I have attended over 60 appointments in the last year. The scariest one was at the Cancer Genetic Clinic as I was worried my daughter would have to have tests. Luckily I was advised she is not at risk, but I will have to wait until late December for the blood results. I had 2 appointments next month, one with surgeon and one at oncology. However I called the BCN for advice about the pain I am now in on both surgery sites, shoulder and now down my arm. She has arranged for me to see oncologists sooner. I have an appointment for Tue 15th. I do not want to look like a hypochondriac worrying about everything but I am also worried that if I ignore pain and discomfort I may be ignoring something serious. I have to keep telling myself that although this past year has been hard I am still here with my family. Let us know how you get on.  Stay strong K",

Was advised to apply body lotion as skin would become dry. Advised to get hand lotion but was not told about deodorants and using Simple body lotion until I was starting radiotherapy. I was told my hair would fall out as declined the cold cap. Hubby found great sites on line with good costs where I bought scarves, bandanas, eyelashes, eyebrows!! and a wig (did not use most of them). I was given an appointment with a local hairdresser who had contract with NHS to dispense wigs. She was great and trimmed the wig to my style. My NHS wig would have cost me £300 (luckily I live in Scotland). Glad to hear that you are getting organised but try not to buy too much. As I bought loads of everything my family with all be getting body lotion etc for their Christmas. Take care K",

I was also diagnosed last November and was told after all of my treatment I would be \"monitored\" for the next 10 years. I have my first annual appointment with the surgeon next month where he said he would arrange my annual mammogram. I will also have annual appointments with the oncologist. I have to attend oncologist today, should have been next month but my great breast care nurse managed to bring the appointment forward when I called for advice regarding pain management.  I was also worried about attending the surgeon yearly but as my ever logical sister-in-law pointed out the fact that they are saying I will be checked for the next 10 years means that they think I will still be here then. Will see surgeon every November and after today will see oncologist every May. This does mean however that my husband's wish of no more hospital appointments is not going to happen. Bye for now as need to get ready for work then hospital this afternoon ( appointment number 61 since last November - pity they don't give us frequent flyer miles for each appointment) K",

I have been referred to the Pain Clinic and physio. Luckily my employer has arranged for me to start physio next week as I have been waiting 2 months already for an appointment. I have joked with my colleague who is the first aider that if someone tells her that I am having a heart attack when I make a strange noise and suddenly grab my chest it is not serious, it is due to the sharp nerve pain I occasionally get.
