      "Content": "My name is Fran, and I'm relatively new to this site. I've recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and have already had a mastectomy and clearance.  I'm just about to start chemo and am thinking of using the ice cap, however my hair is quite fine and I'm worried it won't have any effect. Anyone have any experience, is it worth trying? Also should I consider getting a wig before chemo or perhaps cutting my hair short? Will that help?  My doctors told me I have good veins but my chemo nurse suggested I have the portocath. I agreed with her and told her to do it but now I'm having serious doubts about having it done. I understand it will leave another scar? Is it something that would be noticeable as I'm already self conscious.  No one that close to me has ever gone through this and I'm scared. Can anyone give me any advice about what to do or what to expect? Thanks. Fran.   ",

      "Content": "Hi Gemma So sorry to hear your diagnosis - I know exactley how you must be feeling!. Keeping my fingers crossed for you re the hair but hey with such a young face I am sure you will still look fab and trendy if you do lose it- just think of me - at 50 I will have no way of trying to hide the wrinkles!!! At least you won't have that problem. Seriously though - re the portocath- I decided to go for it and have just come back from the hospital with the job done. I had the proceedure under local anesthetic only - I opted for no sedation and it took less than 45 minutes to complete and my husband treated me to a pub lunch on the way home. Whilst you do find yourself in like a mini operating theatre which can be a bit daunting , personally I found it less traumatic than having dentisty work done. From all the advise I have received from others in our boat and from my experience today I would definatley try and have it done. My Chemo doesn;t start until Monday 28th so have no experiece to say that the port makes that easier but I am very confident now that I made the best decesion on this one. Another little victory to the girls I say on this painful journey. All the best and kindest regards to you - keep smiling   Love Fran x",
