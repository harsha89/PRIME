      "Content": "Thanks Ali Owl, Everyone is getting to grips with their various stages. I am week on from second FEC. It hit me harder than the first one, Plus got a sore throat so am on antibiotics. Just before second chemo was called in by onco to give me my CT results done before chemo started. Suspicious lymph in neck and suspicious adhesion on sacrum and T1 in spine. So that was a shock.....so have been quite anxious as they have said will have third chemo then will be scanned again to see what is going on. Feel a lot better today than have done for few days. Loads of hugs to all of you in this battle arena, you are just brill :)",

      "Content": "Hi all, I have just returned from oncology meeting. They have redefined my cancer. They say it is grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma left side, ER negative HER positive. Would love to hear from anyone who has this type. It also looks from CT scan that it may have spread to spine and lymph in neck, am having another CT scan to confirm, but they seemed quite sure. So looks like my treatment will change and it will be palliative. Anyone who has experience of this, I would love your perspectives. I am reeling from all this information and really don't know where I am. Can't quite believe it all, it has happened so fast. Guess it will sink in as the day goes on. Devastated.",

A few days ago got one of those letters where they sum up things so far and it says diagnosis grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma. I have oncology phone call booked for tomorrow. Am feeling a little unsettled. Any advice?",
