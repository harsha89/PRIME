    "Content": "Hi Shartom: I'm new to the forum but am looking for someone with experience with persistent seroma.  I had lumpectomy last July followed by 30 radiation treatments.  During later part of radiation I developed a hard seroma.  I was advice at the time that my body would reabsorb it.  However, in March I had a flu and suddenly my breast was inflamed and painful.  My surgeon put me on antibiotics right away, I have had four needle aspirations since and another round of antibiotics.  Seems the body will find weakest link and fluid in seroma got infected.  I still have what appears to be a cyst that when touched feels as if there is a pocket underneath.  I'm concerned I may have to have this lanced and cleaned out.  I should mention I had a Biozorb implanted during surgery that is suppose to disintegrate and leave behind six markers.  I wonder if the yellow fluid extracted is this device melting?  In hind sight I think the seroma should have been drained to prevent subsequent infection.  Any suggestions as how to proceed with this?  Hope you are doing well.  Thanks",
