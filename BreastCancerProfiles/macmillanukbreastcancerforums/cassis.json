      "Content": "Hi there, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer 2 years ago which along with chemo and radiotherapy resulted in me having a therapeutic mammoplasty to my right breast which included nipple removal as tumour was in close proximity.  I was offered nipple reconstruction but decided not to have it , but I was also having surgery to Left side so that nipple was also removed, makes for a much smoother line when cold :). My surgeon has said I can always have it done at a later date if I change my mind so hopefully you don't have to rush your decision and might be better to wait till after radiotherapy but you can discuss that with the hospital. You may feel that whats right for you is to have the reconstruction, I was told it was a very simple bit of surgery, but just wanted to let you know if you decide not to, having said goodbye to them I haven't missed them as don't think anyone else has noticed they are not there, when changing at gym etc.  Wish you all the best ",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear your having a rough time, Its 2 years since I had my chemo but when I had my first T dose I felt fine for first 3 days then felt like I fell of a cliff everything hurt, my temp shot up and the skin on my hands and feet got very red a extremely sore, I could hardly walk and skinalso started to peel off big time. I actually got admitted overnight because of the temp increase , but the oncologist did put me on what I think was a high dose vitamin C tablet to try and help with the skin prob. It did seem to help and although I generally felt pretty rough for the next 2 doses I was definitely better than with the first one, like everything else your body seems to adapt given time.Hope you start to feel better soon  Regards Cassis",
