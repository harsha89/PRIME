      "Content": "Hi I have refused chemo and radiotherapy.  I have only just been diagnosed so it will be a while before I know how that will work out.  I have agreed to a mascestomy rather than a lumpectomy to try to capture all of the cancer, 25mm and not oestrogen or progesterone positive. I have changed my diet radically and cut down on calories too to give my immune system what it needs. The consultant tried to talk me round but I stuck to it, I am the only person he has seen who refused the conventional route. All the very best to you whatever you decide.",

      "Content": "Hi Thank you.  Yes mastectomy booked 7th March.  The reason I refused is the side effects.  Macmillan have done their own study and report on these. I will know more after the op as they check lymph nodes but at the moment I am stage 1, grade 2 - 3 so hopefully the tumour will be removed with the lymph nodes clear. I would rather have a mascestomy than a lumpectomy with radiotherapy. It's a difficult decision to make. I still welcome support and sharing with everyone.",
