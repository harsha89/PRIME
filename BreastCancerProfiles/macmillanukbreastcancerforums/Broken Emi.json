      "Content": "As my title says I have just been diagnosed with a nearly 4cm \"lump\" (how the hell didn't I feel that earlier?!?) which is HER2+ and ER+ Any advice on pointing me in the right direction for well.... Anything helpful please I found the lump 3 days before my 41st Birthday and feel totally devastated, lost and broken! My treatment is going to involve} .Tagging the lump . Axillary lymph node biopsy . Chemothrapy x6 . Lumpectomy (assuming the chemo shrinks IT) . Radiotherapy . hormone therapy  It sounds gruelling, painful and down right scary, I just want to hide in my bed until it's all finished but I have 3 children - and can't stop crying.",

      "Content": "Thanks again Julia. I have no idea about herceptin I don't remember that being mentioned, but that's not to say it wasn't - it was a lot to take in! I thought tamoxifen was mentioned for the end so will go armed with more questions tomorrow when I go to get tagged! I don't know why they can't do that when I'm in next week for sentinel node torture??? Emily xx",

It's such a shock and horror to me, I can quite believe it's happening to me - except in those first 3 seconds when you wake up feeling fine then remember you have Cancer........... Does anyone know if the HER2+ / ER+ type cancers are fast growing? In the 3 weeks I've noticed mine it feels a lot bigger and was throbbing/ feeling very full yesterday - it reminded me of the feeling when baby has gone past the normal feed time and the poor boob is too full - cringe! Many thanks again xx",

      "Content": "Hi Penny 1968 Sorry to hear you have been through the mill with all this! As your diagnosis was the same as mine can you give me any pointers to things you wish you had known earlier, how did the chemo go for you? Do they use the same sort every time or different combinations to attack in different ways? Before your treatment could begin did you notice the lump getting any bigger ( mine feels like it's getting bigger and has been throbbing / aching the last few days) Sorry for bombarding you with questions  Emily xx",

I'm extremely new to Breast Cancer and don't know anyone who has had it, so it's a whole new language!!  I would be very greatful if you could point me in the direction of the Chemo chat thread please. I can't seem to find it in the search. So just to add to the confusion it sounds as if there are different types Of Chemo as you specify the type you had................... I guess that's another question to ask. Many thanks again Emily",
