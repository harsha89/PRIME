    "Content": "I had a similar experience in my local Marks & Spencer. Bit nervous about going in on my own so hubby came to. Had lost a lot of weight so wasn't sure on size, how do you measure one! Very nice lady measured me for size and then proceeded to bring me a selection of cup sizes, tried everything on, found a perfect fit, without any embarassment. Helped nod find matching briefs . Also they gave me a voucher for some money off and a very helpful assistant a the till helped me with the Vat free Form. Very happy , a good experience, well done m & sÂ ",
