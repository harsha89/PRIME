      "Content": "Well, the surgeon removed the node, but it never got to the path lab - either lost on theatre or on route to lab. Saw onc and I am having a course of radiotherapy - they wanted to do nothing - just \"wait and see\" - I dont think so, so now I am going to receive the treatment. I have complained to the hospital, but it doesn't make up for the stress and emotions that I have and still am going through. Thank you all for your support. Kimberlina xx",
