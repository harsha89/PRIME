Totally deflated.  Cancer is in my hipbone for goodness sake and I'm not running a race. Back to it again tomorrow.  Suppose he cares at least but would be nice if he would give me a bit of space too. Love and hugs .  Sorry don't mean to whinge Dogspire",

You just need to ask your gpnto refer you to your consultant of choice and may have to be insistent. Good luck Love and hugs Dogspire",
