I haven't actually experienced chemotherapy myself, but there are many who have and it seems that treatments and methods have improved so much in recent years.  ",

ECG and Echo-Cardiogram. Doctor said to go back onto beta blockers - I was told to stop taking them about 15 months ago. When I got home and phoned the surgery to say, they said the hospital had already phoned them. I was so impressed and grateful for that. I had pretty much worked out that it wasn't the Letrozole causing the dizziness and tightness in the chest, but it is nice to have things clear and I hope to be walking at a brisk pace again soon. I hope those of you on chemo or radio therapy have a restful weekend and that the weather is kind.",

Make sure that the INSIDE is  smooth and without any seams or hard bits which could cause corns on your toes. One of the reasons I always wear trainers is that if I accidentally step on something which could cause me to lose balance or turn my ankle, I have the much wider heel base to prevent this. I also take a walking stick, but that's mainly for balance because of having only some peripheral vision to the right.

I'd had a letter about ten days ago saying the apt had been changed. The driver reported back, the transport organisers phoned me and the girl, when she realised even copying down a phone number is a bit tricky said she would deal with it and phone me back, which she did. Now, that was something I really appreciated and took away the worry that might have ensued if I'd  had to do it myself. I have as always been following everybody's news on the e-mail notifications, and I do so admire the way you are all coping. I think the check-up willshow that the lump is probably a fraction smaller, but will post again later in the week.",

I then had to wait another 2.1/2 hours for the transport home, but since there was zero pain, no bleeding, no drain, and NO DRESSING!! that was fine. They put a glue on which feels like a piece of sellotape. The tumour was about 2 cm long and it seems I will have to change medication because Letrozole has evidently ceased to be effective.

Really nice to read about all other activities too. I've been on the Exemestane for several weeks now and the transition from Letrozole has been easy - no problems!",

The doctor who did the ultra-sound said it was difficult to see if the lump had got bigger, but it had changed shape a bit, so it will definitely be better out than in!  No walking today - a gale blowing out there!",

Different tablets (beginning with e) and take them for five years. I said I'd be very happy with that as by that time I'll be 88!",

I've had two doses of  antibiotics during the last two weeks because of a  chest infection so wanted to check my energy levels! I can still feela bit of stitch and/or superglue on wound, but will get someone to look at it before I go back to swimming.   I'm stil amazed at how little trouble it has  been.",

I read all the posts on the Walking Back to Happiness thread and am so very admiring of the support and encouragement given to each other by posters. The warmth and care for others shines out. I have a lump which has reduced in size with Letrozole and although I had radiotherapy 30-odd years ago with the first breast cancer, I have never had chemo. I know and hear about many who do and it certainly seems to be very effective. All the very best of luck..",
