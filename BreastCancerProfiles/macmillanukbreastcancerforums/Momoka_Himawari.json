      "Content": "I'm not a cancer patient myself but both my parents are, I hope i'm not prying but which kind of chemotherapy is it, PICC line or central line or other? My dad had PICC line (which is a very thin tube that stays in your right arm, the chemotherapy wasn't painful for my dad, the side effects that anoyed him were constipation and insomnia (both from the seriods that are supposed to be anti-sickness), My dad had stopped taking the steriods and instead used Ginger as an alternative method for anti-sickness and it worked a treat. the Only other thing was being more sensitive to being cold, he told me his first bite into food no matter cold or hot gives his teeth a funny and anoying \"pins and needles\" feeling but obviously, the colder the food the more intense the pins and needles are. I think thats about it, My dad isn't having chemotherapy anymore, I've noticed he's more energetic so i guess it also tires you out a little. I hope i didn't scare you with what i've typed but If i've learned anything is that staying positive and doing things you like really helps. So keep smiling, the happier you are the weaker the cancer gets! I'll be thinking of you and wishing you and your children good health and happiness. Love Momoka xXx",

      "Content": "hello, My mum has(fingers crossed for had now) thyriod cancer, she had radiotherapy and she did have a funny sense of smell for a few days and then totally losing most of her taste except for bitterness and saltiness but it returned to normal after a month or so. My dad who had chemotherapy didn't have the strange sense of smell dont did lose his taste for a while too. So don't worry, it's not uncommon for radiotherapy/chemo patents to have funny sense of smell and taste, but if you're really worried about it, I'm sure your doctor will listen and confirm that it's just a side effect. I hope you'll have your normal smell back soon! Love Momoka xXx",
