      "Content": "I just posted in \"New to this site\" and got really good reply from Dreamthief (thanks very much and hopefully as you mention, hope I am stopping by than here for a while!) I am waiting for results of core biopsy on my breast , following 1st ever mammogram 2 weeks ago,  then after a recall for assessment which included 2 ultrasounds and 2 more mammograms last week,  The results are due on Thursday.  Has anyone else been through this recently?  The symptoms the drs discussed , seem to match the description of DCIS on Mcmillan's webpages but they are assuring me they are just being precautionary. Should I be worried though? The waiting is horrendous and it is very difficult not to fear the worst.",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for this. I am not sure how big at all the area they were looking at actually is (it looked about 1cm on the ultrasound but that would be magnified of course. ) No clips (that I was aware of) but very pinpointed mammogram specifically on the area after the biopsy (3 samples taken).  Hopefully nothing to worry about and they are being brilliant and thorough and ruling out possible options but obviously one does wonder and then read all the stuff on all the websites and let one's imagination run wild! I will keep you posted after Thursday! Anyway,  thanks again for this and hope you continue to stay well.",
