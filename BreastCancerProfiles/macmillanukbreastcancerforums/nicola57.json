      "Content": "Hi just thought I would let you know how I have coped. Back in January I was diagnosed and had to have chemo for six sessions then I had my surgery at the end of June. I had a DIEP immediate reconstruction after my mastectomy. The surgery took seven hours. I spent 7 days in hospital. This week is 10 weeks since my surgery and tomorrow I finish my 15 sessions of radiotherapy. My wounds healed well. The only issue was some fluid build up in the first few weeks called a seroma which was drained off. I have been very pleased with the surgery I had mine at Addenbrookes.   ",

      "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction 4 weeks on Thursday. They made my re constructive breast from my abdomen {DIEP} It was a long op 7 hours but the result is great. It certainly was the right decision for me. Obviously when I do not have a bra on there is a difference but friends and family said they cannot see a difference when I have a bra on and I am dressed. I did not have have a great amount of pain and 4 weeks on it is a little sore when I am in bed. I feel really good and I had chemo from Jan - May surgery in June and then waiting for the radiotherapy in August. Do hope you make that right decision for yourself.",
