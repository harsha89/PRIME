    "Content": "Hello everyone , today we had the devastating news that my mums breast cancer ( had mastectomy 9yr ago ) has returned and spread to her lungs , there is nothing they can do , she cant have chemo or treatment as she has several other ailments as well and the oncologist said it would just make these worse , she seems to be fine with it all and just said well I`ve had 9yr extra My mum is 82 and cares for my dad who is 87 and has emphysema and pneumoconiosis , so things are going to be a little tough for a while , mum seems to be fine and is still playing mother hen to my dad and insisting she can do things for herself , she is eating little but often although she has lost a lot of weight , I just feel at a loss as to what to do next I have cared for people with cancer before ..... but this is my mum :(  ..... love and light to you all jlo x  Enter your message...",
