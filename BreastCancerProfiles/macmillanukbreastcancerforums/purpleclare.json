      "Content": "Hi Sam, Im new on here today too! I am 40 and have Stage 1 Grade 3 HER2+ I'm having chemo before surgery and I am now half way through and I still don't think I have come to terms with what is going on. It feels like you are on a runaway train at times and I find myself just sitting back and going with it. I haven't figured out yet why some people have surgery first or chemo first.  Good luck with your node thingy ( I tend to use thingy as I still haven't learnt all the terms that are used!)  Clare",
