    "Content": "Morning Suse, yes I am suffering with joint pain caused by tamoxifen mostly in my legs and ankles and feet... I'm 48 but feel 100 some days. I do feel better after walking about for a bit. From what I have been told there are other alternative drugs but I think the side effects are very similar . I hope you manage to get it sorted xx",
