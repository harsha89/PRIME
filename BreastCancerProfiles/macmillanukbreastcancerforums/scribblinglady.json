      "Content": "Hello everyone, I had a mastectomy on 3rd March and the scar is very lumpy.  I saw the consultant who said she would repair it under local anaesthetic - one end is like a mini breast, the size a young girl gets at puberty and the other end has three small fleshy lumps.  I wonder if anyone knows how long this repair takes to heal and whether I can drive when it's been done.  All info gratefully received. thank you!",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Today (3 weeks to the day after right sided mastectomy) I tried driving my car. I found it rather uncomfortable but bearable - until I tried to parallel park! That was hard. So I guess I need to wait a few more days.  Also I am finding that I am so tired - more so than a week ago.  The cording in my arm is painful but that's not it - I think perhaps I just have to accept that recovery doesn't go in a straight line but in fits and starts.  Does anyone out there have tips about dealing with cording and about when driving becomes easier?",

I told the anaesthetist and he took precautions and I wasn't sick. Eveyrone was so kind; when I came round a friendly nurse was there and didn't leave me.  I was due to stay in for one night but opted for an extra night as I live alone and also was feeling faint whenever I got up for the loo. When I was discharged on day after I was fine.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I feared; and the pain was more discomfort than pain.  Good luck -",

I had an anti clotting injection in my stomach and tonight my gums are bleeding heavily. I mean heavily - I get bleeding gums anyway but this is something else and I can only put it down to the effects of the anti clotting.  Of course, being a bit tired, rather sore and on my own I am worrying that other bits of me will start bleeding!  In daylight this will seem foolish I am sure, but if anyone has any advice/warnings, please share them.  Should I tell anyone about the bleeding tonight?",

It's no much and only at one end of the incision.  I do have a haematoma and a seroma but just wondered whether I need to do anything about the slight bleed. Thanks",

I saw BCN and registrar and both said they thought it was as a result of (a) the fact that I bleed very easily and (b) natural drainage.  Neither were unduly concerned but said if it continues to spread and the haematoma gets larger, to get in touch again. Very reassured. Thank you",

While talking to the breast care nurse, she said that when I return for the results of my sentinel node biopsy and follow up in a week's time, I should \"go with an open mind\" because if the sentinel node has traces of cancer, I may need further surgery. I had thought that radiotherapy would be the next step, and hadn't had surgery mentioned before.  Could anyone enlighten me as to probability etc?  I am staying positive but like to get my head round things in advance.",
