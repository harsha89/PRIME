      "Content": "Hi my name is Toni ( 43 yrs old ) and i;m wondering if anyone out there as had their course of chemotherapy stopped at any stage completely ? I've been really lucky so far no major issues since start of treatment with only one stay in hospital but from the start my finger nails became dis coloured and just after my 4/ 6 chemo my middle finger tip and nail became inflammed and doubled in size resulting in yesterday  having  nail pierced and drained ( sounds painful but  not ) . Dr Moody my oncology doctor before draining the finger said that there's a good chance that i will not be able to have my last two FEG treatments due to my fingernail even though not infected but could do if immune levels lower when having chemo . I have two weeks for it to improve as already 5 weeks since last treatment due to nail , did ask the doctor if detrimental to my recovery or higher risk of returning as not having full 6 sessions but not sure if theres any real answer to that ! Sorry to waffle but spent the night mulling over in brain x If anyone has had this happen to them , incomplete treatment , or any information would be really helpful xxxxx Toni  ps had lumpectomy and was not in lymph nodes so not in a bad place  x",

      "Content": "Hi Rebecca thanks for replying its so great when instead of containing your thoughts in your head you can write them and get others to share them with x I'm off tomorrow to see doctor again as its now been 7 weeks since last chemo and as it gets further away the better i feel which is a real catch 22 as now unsure if want to start over with last two treatments ! Its funny really this time last year i knew nothing of what was round the corner apart from Christmas and that never changes !! Good luck to you and I'll be the first to wish you Happy Christmas LOL xxx Toni ",
