      "Content": "I had my hair cut into a bob just after I had my first session, still not sure i'm ready to shave it yet (wimp I know lol), I have my wig but i'm not to sure about it, i've been looking at bandanas and scarves and think I may just invest in some of them and some nice earrings lol, if the tenderness continues I might have to go for the G I Jane look though as it even hurts to lay on my pillow.  Thank you for you reply, I've been reading all the posts for months and this is my first post, I find them all so helpful, and everyone is so lovely, some have even had me in stitches on some of my really low days :)",
