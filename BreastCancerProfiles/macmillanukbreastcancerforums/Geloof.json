      "Content": "Thank you so much for your honesty and I hope McMillan listen to our objections. However, I won\u2019t hold my breath. This campaign was carried out in 2016 also. We should ask those who are so keen to go bald to shave off their eyebrows & pluck out every eyelash!! ",

      "Content": "I agree 100%. Those people have made the choice to shave their hair off. We didn\u2019t have that luxury!  Not only that, but it\u2019s the loss of eyelashes & eyebrows too. My hair grew back very fine and lifeless. My eyebrows & eyelashes are patchy. I have to rely on heavy make up so that I don\u2019t look like a \u2018burn victim\u2019), which is how my ex partner described me. Where does all this hair end up?  Is it used for wigs for patients? I received no help from McMillan during or after my cancer journey. My elderly parents bore the brunt of caring for me and dealing with my finances and helping out with my teenage daughter. Some days I feel so angry & let down. Brave the shave should be scrapped. It\u2019s insensitive and insulting. ",
