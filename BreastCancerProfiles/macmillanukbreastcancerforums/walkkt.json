      "Content": "Hi all, I hope I\u2019m in the right place and I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not! I\u2019m struggling to support my best friend.  She has recently undergone a mastectomy, lymph node removal and nerves taken from her tummy. She is extremely private and never asks for help. I feel like I almost force my help on her and her family. It was her first sos of chemotherapy today and we\u2019ve been chatting via text. She\u2019s just told me she\u2019s struggling. I have no idea how to help her... apart from the little trinkets I\u2019ve found for her over the last few months, flowers etc, I do not know what else to do... If anyone has any advise or words of wisdom that would be great. To top it all off hubby has just started radiotherapy for his cancer - but that\u2019s another story! Thank you for reading my post. Love to all ❤️",

      "Content": "Thank you for the replies, thought I was a lot tougher but the kind words have made me realise I\u2019m not a robot! Thank you. I want to write more but washing up to do and dog needs a quick walk, I want the children in bed now too!  I\u2019ll def be back to try and help others in the same boat. As I keep saying to them, one day at a time, I guess it\u2019s goes for me. Thank you again for your time.  Love to all.",
