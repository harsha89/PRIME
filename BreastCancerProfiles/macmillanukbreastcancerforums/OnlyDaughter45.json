    "Content": "Hi to everyone. My mum is 88 years old now. 13 years back she got breast cancer. She refused surgery, chemo or radiotherapy, and went on to Tamoxifen. That all went fine, and kept the growth of the cancer well under control. Luckily she has not had any pain or side effects from the pills. 3 weeks ago, she had to go into hospital for her arthritis, and they found a growth on her breast, about the size of an apple.  She said it wasn't giving her any pain, so hadn't bothered her GP with it!! She's had a mammogram on the other breast, bloods and an ultra sound. Although she suffers from mild dementia, she is quite sure that she does not want anything other than pain relief  for this. When we saw the consultant at the breast clinic last week, he offered a CT and bone scan, but again she said no. I do understand why she does not want treatment (she said at her age 'quality' is more important the 'quantity'.) However, I am struggling to come to terms with it, as, because she has had so few tests, they cannot say if she has any secondary cancers, or how long she may have left. At her appointment last week, the consultant said he would refer her to Oncology, and they would change her pills., to see if that helped control the growth. When I asked what the results of the ultrasound etc were, he just said 'She has cancer in her left breast'. I suppose I should have asked more, but he did not elaborate on that at all. However, one of the 'Rapid Response' nurses who visited my mum to change her dressing on the growth last week phoned me, to say that the cancer erupting through the skin is normally a sign of advanced stage cancer, and that she was likely to get 'very poorly' over the coming months. We are going back next week to see a consultant on the Oncology side, so I can ask then, but I just wondered if anyone else had experience of this kind of growth before, and if it is indeed a sign that shows at a later stage of the cancer? Many thanks,",
