    "Content": "Hi Wendy  I am sorry about your diagnosis but welcome to the group. The waiting part is probably the hardest part. Once you have your plan set out and start your treatment you will feel so much better. I am about to have my third chemo and guess what it's not been at all bad, the time has flew by. I have a eight month old so she had kept me busy.  I agree it is hard not to worry about family, but once the treatment starts and they see how well you cope with it, they will feel more at ease.  Wishing you lots of luck with your appointment. Xx ",
