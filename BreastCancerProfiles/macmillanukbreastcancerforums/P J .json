      "Content": "Dear all  I had my Micro bubbles biopsy done for the lymph nodes just over 1 week ago . It was only about 10 mins to have it done . Although uncomfortable its not painful. I found out on Monday that my cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. How ever they told me that the oncology specialist will give me an appointment for the end of this week or beginning of next. I have not heard any thing as of yet .  This has left me feeling anxcious and fed up , but not sure why. Im also feeling a little down . Has any one else had feelings like this as well ?",
