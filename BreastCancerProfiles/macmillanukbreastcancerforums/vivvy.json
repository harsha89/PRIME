      "Content": "Hi Jackie I'm sorry you ended up in hospital after your first round of Docetaxel.  I have to admit for me it has been much tougher than FEC.  I finished my third and final dose on 6 January. Like you  I had a very bad reaction to the first dose and had lots of problems and the pains you describe.  I could barely walk and felt like I was about 100 years old!  Because of the problems the hospital reduced my next two doses and also gave me Gabapentin (painkiller) to take two days before I had my next dose and to carry on for the next few days afterwards and it did help.  I still had pain but nowhere near as bad. The side effects were nowhere near as bad because they had reduced the dose.  I'm sure they will do this for you too and it should be much more manageable.  Ask about painkillers too.  Don't be scared as I'm sure your next dose will not be as bad as you are fearing and before you know it you will be out the other side! Sending you best wishes and hugs",

      "Content": "Hi I finished chemo January 2014 and it grew back really curly and I looked like a brillo pad for some time despite trying various treatments/products.  It is now more manageable and grows quickly but still quite dry and I choose to have it short because it looks awful if I let it get too long as I just can't control it.  My hair was always dead straight and fine but I had lots of it.  It's thinner now which is mainly due to the hormone tablets I'm on.  It's one of the things I hate most but I've learned to live with it.   By next September your hair should be much more manageable.",

      "Content": "Well done for finishing chemo! That is one of the hardest parts to get through.  Please have some counselling sessions.  Just because your husband doesn't believe in it doesn't mean you can't have them and it should benefit the two of you if you are able to get some help to cope with what you are going through.  I know people who have found it incredibly helpful.  It is a tough journey we have to go on to get through all the treatment.  It doesn't  just affect us physically but mentally too.  It is hard on husbands but try and talk to each other about how you are feeling also it may be that you are spending too much time together now that he has given up his job.  He may also be having difficulty coming to terms with giving up his job.  Have some counselling sessions and see f you find it helpful and you can be sure whatever you tell her/him will be in the strictest confidence. Wishing you the very best of luck to get through this difficult time  x",

      "Content": "Hi Ceecee I too have had this problem.  I've tried Replens and found it stung afterwards but I found Gynomunal gel much more soothing and it was easier to administer.  You can buy it in Superdrug - I'm not sure about Boots.  I think you will find it better than Replens.   I'm not sure if you can get Gynomunal gel on prescription or not but it's worth a try.  As I was still finding sex painful I went to the GP and she prescribed oestrogen pessaries that I use twice a week.  She checked with with my oncologist  before prescribing it. I am much more comfortable now.  My tumour was oestrogen positive but weakly so.  If they hadn't have prescribed these pessaries I would have come off Letrozole.  The side effects of joint pain etc (I already have osteoarthritis) and the hot flushes are bad enough without having an uncomfortable vagina!!! Hope this helps Vivvy  ",

I had a WLE and full axillary clearance so don't have experience of a mastectomy. I bought Belvia bras by JML which are very comfortable and I used to sleep in them too. I bought medium initially but found that large were a better fit for me. There are no fastenings and they are easy to pull over your head. You can buy them on Amazon and are not over expensive. Also I bought some bras from Bravissimo which had no wires by Royce but I bought these quite a lot later.  Hope all goes well next Tuesday x",

My oncologist wasn't overkeen on me using them too frequently. I hope you find something that suits you.  I would be interested to hear how you get on with Yes. Vivvy",

My lump was small but aggressive as it had gone to my lymph nodes. I'm pleased you managed to find a bra. It does help when you can be in touch with people who have experience of what is involved with the treatment of breast cancer.  Sending you best wishes and hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi Rach I had a lumpectomy and axillary node clearance in 2013 and I can remember the pain getting worse as the days went on.  The first couple of days I felt fine and even cooked dinner for a visiting son.  However, after that the pain did get worse and I think the reason is they inject local anaesthetic in your armpit to help with the pain initially so once that has worn off you experence more pain.  Please do the exercises regularly - it is painful but you will get full range of movement if you perservere.  I know it is a struggle sometimes to do them and I really didn't feel like it on lots of occasions but I persevered and I have full range of movement now.  I was given a CD by Breast Cancer Care to follow for the exercises and it was really good.  I too had a seroma and had it drained.  It feels like you have a tennis ball under your arm! It does take a while for it to feel better and I was concerned about lymphodeoma but as long as you are careful you should be fine.  I can remember worrying about it for quite a while but the anxiety does wear off and I very rarely think about it now.    If it is difficult to straighten your arm it could be cording which needs massaging out.  I had it done at my local hospital as I go to an exercise class there every week for cancer patients and I mentioned it to the physio and she sorted it for me.  It does take time for everything to settle down as nerves get damaged and I had numbess for a long time but that has gone now too.  Until treatment is finished it does feel that Cancer invades your life all the time but I can assure you it does get better. Wishing you all the best Vivvy",
