      "Content": "Hi Louise, I had a haematoma too! It became infected so had to have antibiotics to clear infection before having a further WLE (which had been planned anyway due to results showing lump was bigger than expected). After the second op I had no problems. Maybe you are retaining water all over because of the h, and that's making you a bit bigger. BTW - don't rely on losing weight with chemo. I'm struggling not to put on weight as the steroid they inject on the day makes me want to eat eat eat. Better than be sick I know but I'm having lots of bad clothes days like you when nothing seems to fit! Retail therapy is to be recommended ... Best wishes, Shelagh",
