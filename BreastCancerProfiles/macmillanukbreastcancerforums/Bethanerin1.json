      "Content": "First 10 days after not too bad but last few days my SNB scar has been really sore and some bruising appeared, had consultant check it out today, said it was fine. My breast scar is barely visible now too but breast is still sore from within. Felt more tired too last few days. Just wondered what others have experienced and how long recovery may take. Think I under estimated how long recovery would be.  I go back for results next week, trying to remain positive",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses they have been really helpful and useful to know other peoples experiences.  I have put a pad between my scar and my bra which is giving some comfort when i have to wear a bra to go out, I try and leave it off around the house to lessen the discomfort.   When I last saw my oncologist after surgery she mentioned that she was putting me forward for more chemo on the status of my cancer  before surgery as at that time she felt it hadn't shrunk enough BUT I had the lump and surrounding tissue removed in surgery.  She said it was easier to cancel the further chemo than book it later on. I have had another appt come through to go see her again after I see my consultant on Monday so I'm sensing that it's highly probably that the further chemo is likely and that it wasn't all removed in surgery.  Actually I'm not really sure what to think I just think Monday couldn't come soon enough. I just want to see my Consultant and find out what the bloomin heck is happening. The waiting is sooooo frustrating.   Plus side: I could be told it has gone but be given Radiotherapy to be sure Downside: I need more chemo and will have first one 5 days before Christmas  Keeping a positive mind but the waiting is torture!  xxx",
