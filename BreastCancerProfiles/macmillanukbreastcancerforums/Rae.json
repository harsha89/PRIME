    "Content": "Hi Kaz11. I started chemo 11 days ago after having surgery on 20th January. One thing I would say is that the unknown was the worst thing and I got quite anxious. Having made that step into the unknown, it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Didn't know what to expect but there's been nothing I can't cope with. It's been such a relief. Also the staff at the chemotherapy Suite at our hospital are fantastic and very supportive. They've phoned me a few times to check up on me and my (minor) problems. Have my wig all ready, but who knows, maybe I won't need it. My best advice would be to take each day at a time. Today I can cope. I will try not to think of tomorrow until it comes. Don't be afraid of tears, they relieve tension and heal. No one could have been more anxious than me! Hope it all goes well.",
