      "Content": "Hi Peaches I'm just a bit later than you and will find out my treatment plan next week. What surprises me about this is how advanced the medics are, and how they can provide such individual treatment depending on exactly what they find!  It's good to have the time targets too, and that its all being done quickly so you can get things back on an even keel in a month or so.  With it still being the summer you can recoup with the fresh air and hopefully a bit of sunlight. Good luck with the pre-op  Hugs xxx",

      "Content": "I don't know if I'm talking to anyone or just tapping in my phone, but it might help.  Before I ramble on, the worst thing now is how my family are feeling. My husband lost his first wife 10 years ago to breast cancer and I have the most loving caring parents and sister you could wish for. I can't bear the hurt this is causing them!  Had shoulder freeze for ages and pains across chest, thought it was muscular(on and off for many months) Three weeks ago pain in underarm and breast, 2 weeks ago found lump, 1.5 weeks ago GP diagnosed cyst (no problem), 3 days ago Mamo/scan - we are petty sure  cancer in breast and lymph, full body scans next week then, week after meeting to confirm treatment.  Now mixture of emotions and why does every twinge in my body make me panic. My shoulder and neck hurts - is it just old pain or , but maybe that's the cancer (should I expect the worse or be positive) - everything whirling round my brain.  ",

I didn't know it was possible to cry so much as over the past few days. I will take all your advice and try and roll through the next week. I know I'm a newbee but the hugs and support goes two ways! I walked pas a women yesterday who had hair loss and just wanted to hug her and ask her round for tea. So I will just do it virtually with you all.....xx",

      "Content": "Hi Hi Have been in pain since discovered tumours and biopsies were aggravating. I've had full anc and mastectomy, BCN nurse has really helped to introduce pain relief medication. I have to say pain is muted when you start this and we seem to focus on hair and appearance. I have also sorts of comfy pillows and aids to help me stand and sit trying to keep her pressure or to much stretch from my left side.im pretty rubbish at self pain management (e.g. Breathing techniques etc and need more sleep!) My revelation has been an ibeenie - so versatile! Take care",

      "Content": "Hi If they say precautionary that sounds like a good indication to me, that is what it is.  I had some pain and a lump. 2 weeks ago I had my first mamo and ultra and straight away biopsy, last week bone scan and CT scan. The consultant did strongly indicate to me 2 weeks ago that when we next meet there will be a treatment plan and likely chemo. So although she has to wait for evidence, she knew what she was looking at.  I've been reeling with shock for 2 weeks And trying to prepare for more shocks whilst being positive. This seems different to what has happened to you.  Put your tests down to thorough investigation and precaution and brilliant care of medics. I have my meeting in 3 hours time. I wish you every luck with yours, and hope in the nicest way that you don't need to post again. Hugs Sally",
