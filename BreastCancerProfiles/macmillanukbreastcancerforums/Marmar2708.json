      "Content": "Hi everyone thank you so much for for. Replying so quickly.  It's nice to know I'm not the only one suffering with these pains. I've made a huge mistake I've put my history with cancer on my profile not realising that this is where I should have put it ha ha I'm not very good with technology it took me ages to find this today. My name is shirl I was diagnosed with breast cancer after having a chest X-ray in October 2014.  I was put on Fec 2 once every 3 weeks but another lump came through just after my 3 rd cycle.  I ended up having a bilateral double mastectomy during op a 3rd lump was found.  The last 2 lumps were found to be much more aggressive than the first one.  I was put on doxitaxol but couldn't tolerate it at all ended up in hospital with neutropenic sepsis I was there for a week and had these same pains.  I started a new treatment paxiataxol I had that every week for 12 weeks.  All treatment finished October/November 2015.  I've just had my 3 month check up and my oncologist sent me for a bone scan I am still awaiting results.  I am not on any tablets for cancer as mine was her2 negative and didn't respond to hormone treatments that's why all the chemo, Drs and me hoping that it is enough. I hope this helps you understand my situation a bit better.  Thanks shirl",

      "Content": "Hi this is my first time on here but really need your advice.  I finished my chemo 4 months ago but just before my last session I started experiencing aches and pains.  I have mentioned it to my GP and the oncologist but to be honest I'm not sure I'm being diagnosed properly.  Pain is a personal thing and I know it's hard for Drs to diagnose as pain thresholds vary from person to person.  I've just had a bone scan and I am awaiting results although the dr thinks it could be rheumatism but I thought it only affects joints.  My GP thinks it could be side effects from chemo but I don't have any tingling or numbness.  The pain I have is some times very debilitating that I can't get up out of bed or a chair.  My joints become stiff that at first I can't walk properly but after awhile it wears off.  I'm having a bad day today as I'm typing this my hands and fingers are hurting, I also have pain in my hips legs and all of my upper arms.  My arms are painful even when touched.  I am now on Fentanyl patches 50mcg but they aren't helping.  The strange thing is some days the pain has gone and I feel quite well?   I'm sorry this is so long but I could really do with some help and advice. ",
