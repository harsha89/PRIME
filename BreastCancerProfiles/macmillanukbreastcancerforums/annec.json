    "Content": "Come a bit late to this thread, but in case there's anyone else out there at my stage... I'm about to have a portocath fitted because I had lumph nodes taken from both sides (breast cancer).  No question of payment, and if Noj is stillactive on here it looks like you've found your dissertation subject! I'm at the Churchill in Oxford. Had my first FEC on Friday - 5 to go.  Felt v tired yesterday (Sat) but not sure if that was as a result of staying up all night to watch the election on Thursday night! Only realised how cr@p I felt when I feel so much better today - but am waiting to see if I crash later... Best to all   Anne",
