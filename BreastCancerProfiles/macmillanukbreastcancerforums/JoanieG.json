    "Content": "Hi Von, I just joined tonight. I have had BC twice. First was two years ago this month, Invasive Ductal Carconoma, had Lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.Last year at my one year I had DCIS. At that time I decided that I would have a double mesectomy. Yesterday I went in for my one year again and this time my oncologist said that all looked well. I guess I am still nervous.",
