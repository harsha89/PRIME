      "Content": "Hi  What a big decision to make. I\u2019m so sorry. I came on this site recently as I was having treatment for suspected Breast Cancer, (I don\u2019t have it thankfully) so I just happened to get your query in my email and felt compelled to write. I don't have specific experience of breast cancer, however, my father had dementia and developed oral cancer, so a very similar situation, he was also in a care home. He was 66. He didn't have treatment and was blissfully unaware of the seriousness of his condition. I spoke frequently to social workers and also the local hospice who nursed him at the home as it would have been too traumatic to move him. They were fantastic and yes, he died which was so sad, but the alternative would have probably more tragic in terms of aggressive treatment and possibly the same outcome, but prolonged agony. It was all very peaceful. Whatever decision you make I\u2019m sure will be for the best, but please don\u2019t feel pressurised in accepting treatment that won\u2019t be right for your Mother. Sometimse the best thing to do is nothing and let nature take its course. Hope that helps!",
