      "Content": "Hi all.  Hope you are keeping well.  Have my final of 25 radiotherapy sessions tomorrow. Yey!! Anyway, just over the last few days a tightness under my arm and in the chest area where the implant is has developed. It has become really quite uncomfortable. Does it go away in time do we know?  I'm imagining the implant like a plastic dish that you put in the microwave which shrivels up if left in for too long. These never go back to shape and I'm wondering if the implant will be the same or will it relax in time? I'm not sure I'll be able to stand it if it's like this forever.  Thanks as always for any advice. Xx",

Some advise massaging the area whilst I read in other places it was not advisable to so I didn't. Instead I have been using hemp oil and ibuprofen cream on the area twice a day. It hasn't resolved the hardness of the veins but helps with the soreness and cording that goes with it.  Perhaps worth a try for you. And it won't be permanent that's the main thing. Your veins will recover once the chemos all finished.  Good luck! X",

A healthy gut and colon is essential to keeping your immune system working as well as possible through all we're going through. If your system is clean and healthy there are fewer demands on your immune system.  There are easier things to source than diatemacious earth that you can use though and it is quite expensive. My daily regime includes aloe vera colon cleanse tabs (easily got from H&B), I take Apple Cider Vinegar every day (raw organic unpasteurised ACV with the mother - great for loads of stuff - helps with sickliness, colon cleanser, helps alkalinity, use it on skin for eczema, put on cold sores, all sorts), milkthistle for helping the liver cope with the chemo, supergreens drink every day to boost your pre and pro biotic flora and I even went to the lengths of having a full reverse osmosis water filtration system fitted (6 stage) so it takes all the harmful stuff out of the water such as metals, pesticides, fluoride, parasites (yes parasites) and that's just to mention the nicer things that we can find in our drinking water. The 6th filter then puts back in all the good minerals like phosphorus, zinc, selenuim, etc. It's been a worthwhile and not that costly an exercise which I think is helping me cope with the chemo well. From all the reading I've done, to give your body the support it needs to survive I estimate for my own part the most important 3 things I've done are:- *Cut done on refined sugars and processed foods * Boost your immunity with some of the measures above.  * Eat alkaline foods to boost your body's alkalinity. These things seem to work for me so thought I'd share just as some extra food for thought. X",

I was told by the BCN that it was fine to take it with some paracetamol too for a good hit of pain relief.  For sleeping I used and still use Valerian. You can get it from Holland and Barrett. Plant based so no extra chemicals for your body to absorb. Just a very earth smell to get used to! And for comfort while trying to sleep.... since breaking my leg two years ago I still use a large pillow to put my legs up on but more crucially I still have (can't seem to sleep without it now!) a nice soft pillow under my left side. I invested in some extra soft pillows for my head too (have a funny head too!) You can prop your sore bits up on the soft pillows. I found it helped immensely. Under my left arm is still quite tender at times and find it difficult still to lay on my right side with my left arm resting on my side. But that will pass in time I'm sure.  Hope your Mum finds some relief with something.  Xx",

But it's now Tuesday and that was Saturday. I finished chemo in January and rads in April. It hits you at times.  On the positive - these instances are few and far between and seem to get less and less. It has been ages and ages since I felt like this. Maybe it's just general fatigue due to going back to work and not sticking as rigidly to my supergreens and smoothies as I was.  It will get better and you will start feeling better. I still feel like having a good cry sometimes and why not? A good cry can be as therapeutic as a good laugh at times. Just take one day at a time and take all the support that is offered. It will get better.  Hugs xx",

I know you shouldn't run before you can walk but was wondering if people would recommend returning to swimming at this stage?  Also it's been 8 months since my mastectomy and implant operation. Even now though under my arm slightly further down it is still very sensitive. Sometimes it is still difficult to sleep on that side and still default to sleeping on my back or right hand side. My outer arm at the top near my shoulder is still quite numb. Very odd when I have an itch there as there is little or no sensation when I try to scratch it.  Thanks for any comments. X",

To answer your question by fatigue I mean for example the day before yesterday I did some packing in the kitchen as we have to move in two weeks (right at the start of radiotherapy-bad timing or what - hey ho) and that bit of packing and lifting boxes left me feeling wiped out yesterday. You feel good for the exercise initially but it wipes you out later on.  I think I'm going to return to swimming though very soon and the new tai chi classes will help a lot I think. You've certainly been through the wars too. Leaving it all behind, as you say, once treatment is finished is no mean feat either but I suppose the further behind it is the easier you can pick up the threads of your life again.  Take care. Xx",

So now had four of six sessions of chemo. So surprised, as I coped really well with the EC, that the Docetaxel has knocked me flat. The main problem is aching muscles and joints everywhere. Like having the flu. It's been a week now though and was expecting it to start subsiding by now. Have virtually spent the week in bed with tramadol for the pain. No other real problems apart from that gladly though. Getting quite severe pain under my ribcage at times where my liver is. What are other peoples experiences of this? When did your symptoms start to subside?  Sorry I feel like I only come on here to moan but it helps to know what length of time this might last.  Thanks.
