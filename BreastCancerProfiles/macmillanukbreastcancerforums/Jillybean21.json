      "Content": "Hi thank you Sal and Karen for the lovely welcome Yes Karen they are thinking radiotherapy but will need to have my lump (size of a thumbnail) analysed for clarification and it will be 3 to 4 weeks for the results.  I feel lucky that they have found the cancer in its early stages via a routine mammogram but it\u2019s still a shock when you receive your diagnosis and are not expecting it.   I now feel confident to post any questions or frustrations, thank you Again for the hugs. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Brook,  I started rads last Thursday (4th treatment today), I was told same as you E45 2 or 3 times a day. You have to wash certain products off before treatment but not E45, so I shower and cream in the morning. They told me that if I blister or burn they will give me a prescription.  I must say 4 treatments on and no problems, so good luck ladies, wishing you all the best with your rads too. Jill x",

Followed the link, picked some out, checked my local shop had stock, but bought totally different ones as they fitted better and felt more comfy.   Thank you so much for your post.",
