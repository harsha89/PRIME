    "Content": "Hi all, I\u2019m new to this group, but love the friendly conversations and support you are all giving to one another. I wish you all a very happy and sunny Easter. i wonder if anyone can help me. I\u2019ve had chemo, surgery and radiotherapy which finished last December. All went pretty ok except for the toe and fingernails. I\u2019m still on herceptin injections and have now developed a horrible cough which just won\u2019t go away! It\u2019s a kind of chest rattle and nothing relieves it. Anyone else experienced this?  Many thanks ",
