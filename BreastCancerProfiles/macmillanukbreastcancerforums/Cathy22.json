Now I'm facing the long process of getting \"pumped up\" every week with my tissue expander implant - has anyone else had this done - if so how sore is it ? Dreading it tomorrow as wound is still a bit tender . thanks cathy x",

Not getting my exchange till late August / September at the earliest as my surgeon is fully booked up till then . I'm up at 500mls - hoping not much more saline to go in as I feel I'm going to pop ! How do you find sneezing ? I'm finding it quite uncomfortable much to the amusement of my hubby and kids when I do sneeze . Big hugs Cathy xx",

Now getting the reconstruction as in tissue expander then permanent implant put in..anyway I'm currently up at 300mls and I'm now experiencing back pain . Don't know if this caused by the somewhat hard boulder I feel I have coming out of the top of my chest ! Or is it something random that is causing the now and again back pain ? I was a 34B but now I'm at 36C and bras feel quite uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them.  Any help would be great if it doesn't clear up I'll make an appointment with GP . Thanks again wonderful people :-) Cathy x",

I need some advice ..currently having saline in every 2 weeks (50mls) now up at 500mls so no much more to have put in . The problem I have is I'm finding wearing a bra so uncomfortable as I'm lopsided and I have the wee port thingy just under my ribs . Every bra/sport top the band digs in and makes it very uncomfortable to wear. If I wear a vest top (without a bra ) the lopsidedness is very noticeable especially in this nice weather we are having. I'm looking for a top with cups moulded in but cant seem to find any anywhere . Has anyone else have this problem ? I'm in glasgow. Dreading the summer now as I won't be having my reconstruction(permanent inplant) till late August/September . Hugs to you all xx Cathy",

Luckily lymph nodes were clear so no further treatment is needed. I am currently going through a reconstruction by way of tissue expander followed by implant . I too felt like a fraud by being on here but the support that I have received has helped me emotionally and practically has been brilliant..so keep posting how u feel even if its just to have a rant ! Also feel free to add me as friend as sometimes I still feel bewildered as to why they had to remove my breast if it was 'pre cancerous cells' Take care and hugs, Cathy x",
