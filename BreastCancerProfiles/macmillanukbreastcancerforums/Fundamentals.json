      "Content": "Hello, I was in two minds about blogging as I'm a private person and didn't want to broadcast my thoughts, feelings, experiences etc. The reason why I chose to blog in the end was mainly to be able to share what was going on at any point in time with family and close friends who are all outside of the UK in different countries. I think it helped them stay close and they felt reassured that they knew what was going on. For me, it turned out to be really cathartic. It also helped me keep track of events and conversations. It all happened a year ago and I would probably struggle to  remember how I reached certain decisions without the blog and being able to read up on things. One last reason for blogging, was that I found reading other people's blogs helpful, a little like this forum is helpful because you read, share and connect with people going through similar experiences. So I thought maybe one day someone might come across a few things I've written and find them helpful too.",

I have since had this and I'm recovering well at home, ahead of what looks like chemo in three weeks' time. I'm keen to find out if there are any support groups or threads for people following this path of treatment (e.g. surgery, then chemo) and any tips on coping (acupuncture etc.). Since embarking on this new journey, there seems to be a jungle of information out there on diet advice and other tips to support healing/ health during this time. I find the conflicting advice on diet particularly confusing. Information overload! Hoping to connect with people on here and share, chat, understand, learn. Funda",

I also have been to see a nutritionist and naturalist who specialises in diets for people affected by cancer, though a lot of the stuff was pretty radical. Food for thought. A couple of friends of mine who went through similar experiences a few years ago, said that having acupuncture straight after chemo really helped with nausea and other side effects. I'll definitely consider that, you might want to look into that too. Let's stay in touch! Funda",

I have already seen an oncologist as this was recommended to me a week ago. She didn't tell me exactly which drugs they'll be using during chemo but I'll check out the clubs around this for any support once the time comes. With regards to the diet, I think I'm taking everyone's advice on 'each day at a time'. I eat healthily anyway, so for now will just add more greens to it and cut out unnecessary sugars.

A part of me wanted to believe her so much that this is all 'not a big deal' but as I watched it a few times, I also realised that she must have been pretty 'high' on painkillers, especially during the first video post-op. I think the intention was probably good but the outcome was rather 'dismissive' of the procedure. As a lot of people said on here, no person or situation is the same and I agree that she probably talked too soon. I'm happy for her that it was all so easy in her case.. I feel lucky that for me the actual surgery and post-surgery hasn't caused unbearable physical pain or any complications. But I wouldn't dream of bragging about it in the way she did. I think her tone just wasn't right and skewed the whole effort behind what was meant to be a positive, encouraging piece.",

I completed four cycles of EC a couple of weeks ago and used the cold cap for each session. Yes, the first 10-15 minutes are painful (and got progressively more painful as my hair thinned over the weeks) but if you can stand it for the first few minutes, you start to get used to it and barely feel it after a while. I didn't get any headaches from it but probably felt woozy and had cold feet, cold nose, hands etc. but that generally passed overnight. Everyone's different of course but for me I have managed to keep hold of a lot of hair - it has definitely thinned but I didn't lose all of it and haven't needed to wear a wig/ scarf. I would also recommend you get a silk pillowcase as it reduces the friction at night. Basically, whatever you can do to be gentle to your hair/scalp. Hope it all goes well! Funda x",

I would say definitely try it and just like Anne said, make sure your hair is completely wet with lots of hair conditioner on before the cap comes on. Some people also say it helps to take a paracetamol an hour beforehand. Remember that feeling when you're a child and you bite into an ice cream too quickly? That's how it felt for me during the first 10 minutes each time but you then get used to it. In my case, the cap came on around 45 minutes before the injections/ infusions and had to stay on another two hours after. I found it quite manageable the first time round but as my hair started thinning, it felt colder and more uncomfortable each time. It has, however, worked for me. Hair loss did start week 2 after the first treatment and a few strands of hair have been coming out every day since which means my hair has thinned quite a lot but not disappeared completely yet. I have one more treatment to go so I'm hopeful it stays that way. Make sure it's very tight especially around the top of your head and imagine a hot summer's day by the sea with the sun beating down on you when the cap is put on your head. Good luck and I'd say it's definitely worth trying!",

I started with an extreme of cutting out dairy, sugars (fruit sugar included), meats etc and while I felt good, I lost weight and felt very restricted as to what I could eat. At the time I had consulted a nutritionist who basically prescribed this strict plan. Now, post chemo, I am sticking to some aspects of that original plan by cutting out refined sugars, processed food and dairy where I can. Dairy mainly because of the growth hormones it has, cow dairy that is. Goat and sheep milk doesn't contain the same levels. My cells were hormone receptive so that's part of the logic behind the dairy. I have since also learnt and with the help of a different nutritionist and functional medic who does Skype consultations, that a blanket approach is probably not the way to go. As with chemo reactions, cancer cells etc no body is the same and so finding out what your measures are in terms of vitamins, minerals etc which you can get done by your GP (blood test) is a good start. There are also other tests that look at vitamin D, magnesium etc I'm currently waiting to get my results so that I can decide on supplements, which supplements and what I need more or less of etc... For me this approach makes most sense as otherwise I feel pulled in too many directions.",

      "Content": "Hi Silvercloud, I echo a lot of the comments made on here. It needs to feel right for you - whatever the decision. I was very against chemo and just couldn't get my head around it at all. The percentage benefits the oncologist had outlined were 12% I think and even though that sounds like a lot to many people, at the time it sounded too low for me. I did the endopredict test, hoping it would give some clarity but it came back as medium risk. My oncologist who isn't very aggressive said that she would recommend chemo but would support me whatever the decision I make. After many days and weeks of deliberation, I decided to have four rounds of EC. As many have said here, it's doable - draining, physically straining but doable. I was so frightened and imagined the absolute worst in terms of side effects and changes to my body. I'm now 8 weeks post treatment, about to start Tamoxifen. A part of me wonders what I would be like today if I hadn't opted for chemo but I think a bigger part of me is glad to have gone with the recommendation and to have this behind me. Of course, being adjuvant, there's no way of saying: great, it really worked. But I think overall I feel more at peace that I opted for this. Having said that, if my gut instinct had been strong enough a few weeks ago, I think I would have decided against it. Whatever you decide, if it feels right to you, then it's right. Funda xx",

Don't know whether to put this down to the drugs or down to all the juicing or a combination of both but definitely different to how things were before. I also had a couple of fillings done after EC number 2 and it has taken a while for my teeth to settle as the fillings were originally too high so whenever I was grinding my teeth at night or chewing, they would hit down too hard. The dentist said it takes quite a while for teeth to settle afterwards - I imagine that if you bite down hard or grind together, it'll be a similar thing? If your teeth don't hurt constantly but only when you bite down, it might just settle without a dentist's visit?",

Basically I wake up feeling hot, sweating around my forehead and chest, then after a few minutes of cooling down, I'm able to get back to sleep until a short while later and the whole thing repeats itself. I know that chemo can induce early menopause but I still have my periods (last one was too early but still very much there) and I don't have any hot flushes during the day. Wondered if this is maybe my body trying to get rid off toxins or is related to the drugs etc.?  Wondered if any of you had a similar experience you could share? Thank you, Funda",

Make sure, as someone said, to bring someone with you when you go and get the results. If you can't, then definitely record the conversation. I feel that whenever I was nervous in those meetings, I forgot half of what was said if it wasn't for the recording. Also, if you have any questions about anything, write them down beforehand, it helped me. Wishing you all the best, Funda",

      "Content": "Hi all, I finished Radiotherapy last week, completing 15 days of it. My skin looked totally normal by the end and no other side effects. Then, after a couple of days, I noticed some redness towards the top part of my chest and little bumps - similar to those some might get with a sun allergy. They did say that the effects may only show on the skin 1-2 weeks later but then ease up a week after that. I was given \u2018double cream\u2019 to moisturise with and have religiously been applying it twice a day. It is beginning to feel quite sticky though...  Question: is it okay to use 100% aloe Vera to maybe ease the heat sensation and itchiness? In general, can I now use other moisturisers now that RT is over? And on holidays, I know sun block is a must - again, I assume I can use any brand? Thanks for any guidance",

      "Content": "Hello, I had my test results of the endopredict (similar to oncotype) back and they've put me in the 'medium risk' category which means chemo is recommended. I was hoping to fall into the low risk category but I'm now slowly getting used to the idea of the imminent chemo. My oncologist said we would ideally start this side of Christmas and she has drawn up three different regimes: 1) FEC-T which is around 18 weeks 2) ACT (?) - around 16 weeks 3) Another regime (couldn't quite confirm which drugs) which is a lower dose and runs 4x 3weekly and then weekly for 12 weeks with a total of 24 weeks Has anyone else ever consider a lower dose, longer term chemo or was given these options? I find it hard to make a decision on having a shorter cycle with possibly more side effects or a longer cycle with potentially less side effects, though who knows as we can't predict the side effects. A part of me is tempted to get it over and done with while another thinks it might be less tough on a longer term, lower dose? Thanks for any feedback, Funda",

The first 1-2 were kind of okay but the third and fourth one were really tough as I had started to lose some hair and so everything seems just that much colder during those two sessions. I almost gave up after the third but glad I persevered. I managed to keep enough hair (and my hair was always curly) not to wear a wig. If you can find a way to distract yourself or even watch video of hot places, maybe some beach / travel clips during the first 10-15 minutes, then I'd say try and go for it one more time. x",

She said it's like being shipwrecked. You were on the boat, sailing along, had all the necessary maps to navigate, navigate high waves, a bit of wind, rain etc. but suddenly a massive storm took you off course and battered you around. You made it back to safe land and everyone cheered on shore, happy that all is okay. But you can't cheer along because you feel stranded, battered and bruised. For me, this was spot on but I guess we will all get back on that boat again and start sailing, just a little differently maybe or more mindfully. The hard part for me, is that I'm impatient and I just want things to be okay again but deep down I know that grief can't be rushed and I guess in some way what we're feeling is grief. Making plans and having things to look forward to definitely helps I found. Have a great time in Amsterdam! Funda xx",

For me, it's been really important to keep track of conversations, how and why I made the decisions I made and all the things that happened during the early stages of diagnosis. I think it also made me reflect on things and cope better. As my family lives abroad, I wanted them to always know what was going on so I decided to capture everything on a blog rather than a physical diary. It was also a good way for me to understand myself and helped me not internalise too much but instead get thing off my chest. x",
