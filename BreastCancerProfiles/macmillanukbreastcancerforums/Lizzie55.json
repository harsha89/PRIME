      "Content": "Hi - totally natural to be scared - had tumour out last Monday and total node clearance -felt very upset after op - no real feedback. One of the surgeons couldn't understand why I was upset. I have been utterly gobsmacked over the lack of emotional care. I honestly can't get over how cut off from normal human feelings these professionals are - I truly find THAT scary and the least possible time I'm in a hospital the better. I'd rather be at home and die there peacefully if needs be.",
