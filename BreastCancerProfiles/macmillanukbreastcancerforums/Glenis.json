    "Content": "Hi Jane, I was diagnosed Dec 5th 2007 (a date that will be forever etched in my memory!!) I have also been told that I'm lucky because the tumour was small and nodes were negative but I don't feel 'lucky' all I feel is still afraid and confused. I was lucky in that I have a very good breast cancer nurse, something that you were denied. I had my op on New Year's Eve and have just started my radiotherapy which will finish around Easter (had my pre-op on Christmas Eve so thats pretty much all of the bank holidays taken care of(LOL).) I get angry that all my friends keep telling me that I'll be ok now when I don't feel it, part of me wants to hide from everything and everyone and there are days when I just want to cry.Tell you what made me angry was that when I was told that my nodes were clear everybody celebrated but I just wanted to scream that its still happening to me. I don't know when I'll start to feel better but I know I will but I think I'll feel afraid for a very long time. Glenis",
