      "Content": "Hi everyone I am new to this site and seeking a little support and advice.  I was diagnosed with Stage 2 invasive lobular breast cancer at the end of November 2018, had wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy in December.  The nodes were thankfully clear and my surgeon informed me that all the cancer had been removed with clear margins, however the grade was higher than hoped for at Grade 3.  After Oncotype DX testing with a recurrence score of 29, the Oncologist has recommend I have FEC chemotherapy, 6 courses, 3 weeks apart starting in February, followed by a 4 week gap, then 3 weeks of radiotherapy (every day Monday to Friday for 3 weeks) then 'boosters' the following week.  Is 6 sessions more than usual does anyone know, or is this pretty standard stuff? I am absolutely terrified of chemotherapy and wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience. I\u2019m feeling ok now after my surgery and I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve made the right decision in agreeing to go ahead with the chemo and radiotherapy, though I know that\u2019s a personal choice    I wanted to reach out to someone out there who has had a similar experience.  I have what feels like a whole library of reading matter given to me since this journey started and am beginning to feel somewhat overwhelmed with the whole frightening experience. Has anyone out there had a similar experience or been through FEC chemotherapy? I also have to have a PICC line inserted soon and I\u2019m worried about that too   If you have read my post this far, thank you for taking the time :-)",

      "Content": "Thank you Sue for responding to my post.  It has surprised me how many people have answered me and how supportive and caring people are.  Think I will be glad to just get on with the chemo now.  I've had a whole load of hospital appointments come through today which makes me feel a bit depressed at the amount of stuff there is to get through, even before chemo begins, but I just have to deal with it a bit at a time.  Thanks again for listening and all the best to you too",
