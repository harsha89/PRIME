      "Content": "My late husband had AML, but sadly died from an infection which he had no immune system to fight. I had a mastectomy on July 11th. It was successful, the cancer hasn\u2019t spread, but I am having a course of chemotherapy which starts on August 24th.  I can\u2019t get it out of my mind that it was the chemotherapy which caused Alan\u2019s death, even though I know it was the leukaemia.  I feel, quite irrationally scared at the thought of chemotherapy, even though I know it\u2019s the right thing for me to do. Feeling very small and alone, in spite of family, friends and my church who are all supporting me so much.",
