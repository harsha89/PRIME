    "Content": "I had lumpectomy and SNB on 24th November and will hopefully get my results tomorrow.  I found waiting for the results of the original biopsy far worse as I imagined all sorts of outcomes including death - I even planned my funeral!  Once I knew it was cancer but treatable with lumpectomy etc it's been far easier to deal with.  I'm just hoping tomorrow brings good news and that I can avoid Chemo as I'm self employed in a physical job and can't afford the time off work.",
