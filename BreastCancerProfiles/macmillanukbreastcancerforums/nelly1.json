      "Content": "Hi I\u2019m so sorry you feel anxious about the hospital  i had a mastectomy in January, I had the op at 2pm had to be at the hospital at 11, my belongings stayed with me until I went Down, I kept my dressing gown with me, when I came round everything was in my room & my dressing gown had been put in a clear bag & took to my room, everything was there, I think now they are a lot better with this kind of thing as it just gives the hospital a bad name  try not to over think it, maybe phone ur hospital to see if they have lockers etc   slso I did come home in the same day as I was determined not to stay in hospital over night i was told as long as everything is ok then I could go & I did   hope all goes well, but really try not to over stress about it xx ",

      "Content": "Hi & welcome  I totaly understand how ur feeling about the money worries, I\u2019m self employed so if I don\u2019t work I don\u2019t get any money & of course if I can\u2019t work then I just can\u2019t, I\u2019ve looked into all sorts & purly because I\u2019m self employed there isn\u2019t any help available.... although I\u2019ve just applied for P.I.P I\u2019m on the understanding that this doesn\u2019t go on ur incomings or how much u have in the bank etc but may be able to get a little of something & anything is a bonus    Look it up on google I spoke to someone & 3 days later the paperwork arrived the lady I spoke to said I would have to send everything (documents) by post but also heard that if u go to ur local job centre they will scan everything for u & send it from there   (apparently they want the real documents not a copy but I\u2019m reluctant to send these through the post ) so if it\u2019s true that the job centre can do it for u then another bonus   hope this helps & fingers crossed it\u2019s a little towards u living ur life xx ",

      "Content": "so on my 2nd round of chemo  with 6 more to go  3 days of steroids & finding today (the same as my last round) day 5 & 6 the fatigue is just terrible   is it because the steroids have stopped or just the chemo doing it\u2019s thing ? Or both ?  I\u2019m currently layed flat out in the sofa  with a fan on me & this lovely English summer (only we can have The hottest summer ever whilst going through chemo)   aching beyond aching  & just don\u2019t know what to do with myself other than lay here  I know I need to listen to my body  I\u2019m drinking loads of juice & water  but any other advice or tips anyone can give would be greatly appreciated   thanks x",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply  i mentioned it to my oncology dr the first time, he said it was prob down to the steroids I\u2019ve been put on some injections to stop the white blood cells from dropping too much ( or at least I think that\u2019s what they said they was for) as I had a real bad bout of it last time & ended up at the hospital getting checked   so I guess this time I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be as bad  ... which it probably isn\u2019t but it\u2019s not  far off   Ive had no sickness either just this tiredness that is totaly beyond tiredness   ill mention it again to him next time I go  but lovely if you could keep me posted ... I just think these kinda days are a complete wash out",
