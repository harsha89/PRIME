    "Content": "Hello all, firstly apologies if I'm not posting in the right place or under the right topic etc. New to this group.  I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer on 10th April. 3.5cm lump, Stage 2, Grade 3 on the right breast. No lymph node involvement. I am due to start Chemo on 1st May, x4 EC followed by x12 Paclitaxel with x4 Carboplantin. Sadly  I have travelled down this road before and totally devastated that I have to go through this journey again! In 2011 I also had a triple  negative Breast cancer in my left breast and had Chemo, Radio and a lumpectomy. The good news is that this cancer is totally unrelated to the last one so it's not metastatic.  Would love to hear from others also starting Chemo in May. Good luck to us all.....prayers up! #triplenegativecancer #neoadjuvantchemo",
