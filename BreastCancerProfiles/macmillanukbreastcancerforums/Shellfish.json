    "Content": "I'm just starting my journey. Breast cancer has spread to liver, lungs and bones. I find out on the 11th October whether I will be having chemotherapy or hormone treatment amongst other things. I have one daughter, who has the most gorgeous long hair. If she were to shave it off I'd be devastated. It wouldn't do anything to help me but would just traumatise us both. I think this campaign just makes people feel guilty and forces them to do this to 'share the experience' to show they support us. No! How awful. There are so many ways that money can be raised without guilt tripping our daughters/sisters/wives etc. into this degrading act. I couldn't agree more and wish you luck in your journey.",
