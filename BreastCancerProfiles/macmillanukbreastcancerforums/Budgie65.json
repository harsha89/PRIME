    "Content": "Hi, Thank you for posting, I was reading about this the other day but thought it was currently on hold.  I have my first oncology appointment on Wednesday and would like to take part as I am unsure whether Chemo is really needed for me.  Do you now if you can choose to have the testing or are allocated randomly? Not much help to you I'm afraid! but please let me know how you get on, I will let you now if I am allowed to sign up.",
