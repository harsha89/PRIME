    "Content": "Hi Susan Hope you are doing OK. My wife Elaine had a lumpectomie and five lymph nodes removed and twenty five session's of radiotherapy in 2008, Elaine was also put on Arimidex and after a while started to get Joint Pain (wrist's and knees) We went back to see the Dr about it and he changed Elaine onto Letrozol 2.5MG Tabs, and has been on these Tabs for about two months now and unfortunately still gets joint pain :( Elaine has had no other side effects on either of those pills just the joint pain and has decided to just carry on with it. Elaine finds that it is first thing in the morning that it causes the most pain so she uses a wrist support at nite to help, and also during the day if it feels like it is starting to flare up again. We cant understand why it is bad in the morning after a night's rest?? but maybe some one else could throw some light on that one :) Take Care and speedy recovery Tom",
