      "Content": "Hi there, I had to take steroids for three days post FEC to help with the nausea and they also made me very restless. So long as you are resting you will be ok. You go on a huge emotional roller coaster ride through FEC so just remember to be good to yourself. I found that weeks one and two were pants and I would rally a bit for week three. So listen to what your body is telling you. Steroids have an added bonus of assisting the chemicals to do their job. Remember plenty of fluids and eat what you can tolerate.  Sending you my thoughts and hope your sessions go without too many problems. Della xx",

      "Content": "Hi there, They should do your bloods before starting your chemo and if your white cells and neutraphils are low they may delay. It will depend on your oncologists parameters for treatment. My advice would be to keep warm and plenty of fluids and hopefully by Tuesday you will be over the worst. If you are really concerned and have a support nurse just give them a quick call to put your mind at rest.  I am on cycle four of chemo and have had one incident of delayed treatment as my cell count was low. It's not a picnic but nowhere near as bad as I imagined it to be. wishing you all the very best but above all just remember you are strong and can do this. hugs Della",

My mum came to every appointment with me and was my rock, my other half was fantastic too. Share your worries my friend and the path becomes less scary. Write down any questions that come to mind so that when you have your next appointment you can go through them with your team. Breast care nurses are a godsend and the McMillan team are a great source of information and support. Don't struggle on your own we are all here for you. Stay strong and become a cancer warrior and kick its butt. You can do this I promise xxxxxx Della ",

      "Content": "Hi Powderpuff, now start by taking a deep breath and see if this helps. What you are feeling is perfectly normal for any newly diagnosed lady or man. There are so many fears and anxieties, appointments, questions etc. the micro mets in the lymph nodes does NOT mean you have cancer anywhere else even tho you will always have that on your mind. You are about to go on a roller coaster ride but there are plenty of people on here and in the hospital who are more than prepared to hold your hand and get you through. You may feel that you do not belong to you for a while but hang in there.  I have just finished all my treatments after a lumpectomy, reduction and axilliary node clearance. I had 6rounds of FEC chemo and then 20 sessions of Rads. If you need any help or support make use of your local support services and the wonderful ladies on here. You can do this and you are joining a set of strong yet vulnerable ladies who have all been there and are here to give you love and support. Ask as many questions as you need to......we all did.  Wishing you all the very best and I am here anytime you need a shoulder or a hand. Wishing you all the best on your treatment journey and it's ok to be worried and scared. But you will be ok.  Della",

It is quite normal apparently and several of my chemo buddies have complained about heavy legs and joint pains. I finished chemo in Jan and rads in March and am still getting some pains. Your body has been under assault for months and it does take time to recover. I have just started reflexology which is heaven and some trusts will pay for it for you. Well worth looking into.  All the best, Della",
