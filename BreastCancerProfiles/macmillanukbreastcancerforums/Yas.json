    "Content": "Hi Emma, Wondering how you got on since you last posted? Trying to find more information/stories to help me understand what might be possible (family wise) over the next few years in light of my recent BC diagnosis. Overall I\u2019ve got a very good prognosis but will require \u201cmild\u201d chemo, herceptin and up to 10 years of tamoxifen.  I\u2019m 27 and currently undergoing fertility preservation ahead of chemo, so fingers crossed it works out well. Would love to hear some positive stories though, it seems so many posts indicate a road of real hardship for the future. While I\u2019m so relieved that I caught my bc early, I\u2019m devastated that I may lose the bright and promising future I felt so certain I would have.. Hoping you\u2019ve had a more positive experience or at least some words of wisdom to offer   Yasmin x",
