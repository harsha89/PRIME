      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed just over a week ago, 5.5cm & lymph positive, CT clear.  Cut a long story short have already transferred my care to another hospital already as have been offered neoadjuvant to shrink prior rather than straight to maestectomy plus entering trial.  Second opinion said first had painted lymph as very bad but on analysis of my scans said lymph minor.   I have an on off throb in upper arm & on off tingling fingers, not enough to stop life & be dropping stuff but enough to notice (mobile devices make it worse), last two days headache later in day (not on waking), nothing migraine like, more peri meno like but I am terrified this is a move to brain.  Am with my Prof oncology tomorrow and am so so scared.  My anxiety is off the scale, I am climbing the walls at night & can\u2019t function.   So, so, frightened. ",

      "Content": "Hi Sal, thanks so much I really appreciate your response I was so bad last night I ended up taking diazepam.  If I am correct my CT only covered thorax, abdomen and pelvis with contrast so feel sure anything in my brain was not covered. When I transferred I felt so positive about the move, as did my support, I know I need to be positive but this is so very tough ️",

      "Content": "Good morning everyone. Diagnosis at stage 3 yesterday, 5.5cm lump & several lymph so mastectomy & full lymph strip on 11th.  I am in a lot of pain, nodes and breast, inverted nipple so very sore. GP gave me codeine last week but not helping, constant ache, does anyone have idea of what would help?  I am sure this has been asked a trillion times but the anxiety over spreading in the 3 week wait for surgery is off the scale, will the wait really make no difference? 5.5cm in my consultants words \u2018very large\u2019. Feels huge to me, I want to be in next week!  It\u2019s my birthday today - bit of a rubbish pressie TBH!  Daisy ",
