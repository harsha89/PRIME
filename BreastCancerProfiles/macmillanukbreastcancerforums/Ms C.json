I rang the hospital (they have a 24 hour cancer helpline) and they put my dose down 20 per cent next time.  The next round was almost pain free although the pains returned for the final round. The hospital told me that these pains normally go after the first week - and that was true in my case. Take care",

We started small with hugs, massages and making time earlier in the day when I wasn't so tired . We didn't try to have full sex at first and it was a while before I felt like it but it did feel good to have our hugs back.",

If the hospital computer has lost you and missed the NICE deadline for your chemotherapy referral, then they will want to know. I would ring up and speak to the breast cancer nurse or the receptionist. I had to do this all the time when I got treated because the hospital was putting in a new computer system which either made my appointments twice or not at all.  best wishes Ms C",

The best advice I had was to do them first thing in the morning and get them over with so they don't ruin the whole day.",

I still have some numbness and swelling but have full movement . I don't know how important driving is in your life but I would try and do a pre operation tidying and errands blitz so that you can come home to a tidy house , comfortable bedroom and fridge full of easy food. It's also worth checking that you've got some easy on tops with loose sleeves .",

I had a lot of bra extenders as well -I would shed one most days as the swelling went down. ",

The nurses gave me a little fabric bag made by the local WRVS ladies to put the packets in when I was moving around so that I had my hands free. I was a bit awkward just after the op what with the drains and the anaesthetic and it was good to be in hospital with a toilet with grab rails . I would go for the overnight stay if I were you . best wishes",

Basically you line the needle up with your fat fold , so that the needle is going in at a very shallow angle. loosen your grip on the fat fold a bit and just put a tiny bit of pressure on so the needle tip goes in -you don't have to bang it in. Then you just have to put a little bit of pressure on the blue end so that it goes in very slowly. You don't have to force the needle in -slow and steady is fine. Hope this helps",
