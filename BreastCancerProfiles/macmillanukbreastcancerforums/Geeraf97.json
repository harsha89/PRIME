I will say though the rest of the breast cancer care here is stellar - my surgeon has a private Harley Street practice alongside his NHS work and is also president of the British Oncologists Association!!

      "Content": "Hi there Yvonne, This is my first time on the community and I am now four weeks past a double mastectomy which followed 6 months of chemo. I have been told I am now cancer-free which is fabulous news but I have to say I'm feeling more depressed now than at any other time throughout treatment. I feel guilty about this and also confused but I think it is mainly down to post-operative discomfort. My scars are healing well after an initial setback of developing a haematoma under the right hand scar. I feel really bruised, I have a lump of skin under each armpit which is preventing me holding my arms naturally by my side and consequently I'm holding myself awkwardly which is giving me backache. I can't get comfy in bed, dread going to bed at night and wake up exhausted, achey and depressed each morning. The reason I'm telling you all this is because I fully understand how you feel. You want to get better but you feel worse and progress seems to have ground to a halt. I feel very frustrated about my limitations. I'm particularly not looking forward to the school Easter holidays as I can't drive and just don't seem to have the will or the energy to do things with my nine year old at home. It's really hard when you're used to being energetic and in control to have to live with your temporary limitations. My good friends have just advised me to go easy on myself. I think it helps to know that the people around you are not expecting you to be yourself. They know you're not up to normal activities even if you don't! I find I do have to make myself get out of bed, do my exercises and do something. Once I'm up, life seems a lot more do-able. Sorry I've gone on a bit but do feel for you and want you to keep hopeful and get better.",

I did ask one of the nurses last time I went to the chemo dept. and she said in my hospital it was only being given to certain patients and she was not clear what the criteria was for it. She said she had administered it to one lady and you still have to stay in the dept for two hours after the injection. I don't know if it differs depending on the dose but when I look at how much I'm getting through IV that would have to be one big syringe!

For me the most horrible bit was feeling initially okay after the IV and then it hitting you three or four days later, just when you felt you might be getting away with it. My feet and hands were numb and tingly and it's only now that that's wearing off. I was given some really good deep moisturising cream called Pliazone which absorbed very quickly and wasn't greasy.

You do get pulled about in surgery and it takes quite a while to heal up after that no matter how good the surgeon's sewing is! Now, two months on, my scar lines are smooth and have faded to mid pink. My lovely bcn said to be patient with myself because the body has been through trauma and it can take months to fully heal.

      "Content": "Hi Yvonne and all you other lovely ladies who've replied so far, Thank you for your honesty because now I don't feel so bad about having a total melt-down last Friday. My experience has been much the same as yours, went from finding lump week 1, biopsy in the middle of a school residential trip week 2, started chemotherapy week 3. On that for six months, five weeks off and then double mx! I have not had time to draw breath and suddenly realised I had never had any letters from the hospital about my diagnosis or treatment plans. Apparently it's policy at my hospital not to send copies of letters to patients unless they request them. I suddenly felt a real need to read through everything because I felt like I had no idea what on earth had just happened to me. Does that sound really stupid? I also found out that day that my statutory sick pay had finished three weeks earlier and my diminished pay cheque was going to be even smaller. I felt like. I just couldn't take another single thing, had stressed words with husband and the just got in the car and drove away. I had no idea where I was going but just wanted to be away. drove aimlessly for about an hour before reason kicked in and knew husband would be stressing. In the cold light of next day decided to get proactive and see my notes. I called my bcn and she told me to come in and see her straight away. (Must have sounded like a woman on the edge - which I was.) She took me through all my notes and explained I had had grade 3 Invasive ductal carcinoma, multi-focal, which means the whole breast was affected with several tumours and it was starting to spread into my lymph nodes and it was HER+ hence the whirlwind strike with the chemo. I was pretty shocked about it all and, like you, Yvonne, suddenly realised I'd had cancer. The up side to it all was that she went through my post-surgery report in the same detail and it was the best news. When they looked at the affected breast there was no sign of any tumours and there was not a single cancerous cell in any of the 11 lymph nodes. The only thing they found was a tiny patch of pre-cancerous cells. I thank God for the speed of diagnosis, the chemotherapy, the skill of the surgeons and the prayers of friends and strangers that together have brought about a miracle for me! I think we all probably arrive at a point where we have time to stop and think and recognise how out of control and terrifying it's all been. Perhaps we need to before we can pick up the bits and start our new 'post cancer' lives. Thank you for being there and listening. Lots of love to you all, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Elvis, I'm now five weeks past a double mastectomy. The operation itself was straightforward and I was not in pain afterwards. You do have drains in your scar site immediately afterwards and these can be awkward when you're moving about. I think I was more anxious about these after the op than anything else but they are taken out after a few days, seven at the most. The best advice I could give is try to get yourself prepared for what you'll look like afterwards. There's an excellent website called breast less where you can look at before and after photos. this helped me know what to expect. I was also advised to look at my scars as soon as possible and get used to seeing them so it was not too big a shock. There's lots of great advice on this website, talk to your Breast care nurses too. Sometimes they can put you in touch with someone near you who's just gone through it so you can talk face-to- face with them. Please remember you are you with or without boobs and the op is not going to stop you being that special person you already are. All the people around you who love you will be able to tell you that far better than me. Lots of love.",

      "Content": "Hi Lemurgirl, Glad to hear you're through your chemo and moving on to the next step towards recovery. 1) Take plenty of things to keep you occupied - good book, iPod, puzzle books etc - most ladies on here have said the worst bit it the waiting around especially if your surgery is booked for the afternoon and you probably will feel like doing something fairly soon after the surgery. 2) Extra knickers!!! I always pack a spare pair anyway but then found myself kept in hospital for an extra day and wished I had another pair. Allow for at least two pairs a day to keep you fresh - hospital mattresses can get very hot! 3) Non-meltable tasty snacks (obviously not before surgery!) My lovely hub brought in fruit juice cartons, grapes, biscuits, crisps etc. Also keep a water bottle with you and keep drinking - it is a bit of a pain going to the loo with the drains attached afterwards but you need to keep drinking. 4) My hospital were very sweet and gave me a bag to put my drains in when moving around. It sounds a bit silly but it did make them easier to manage, particularly in the bathroom - the bag was just a cotton square with a long handle on it that you could sling round your neck or over your shoulder. The long handle was good because you could tie the bag onto a towel rail while on the loo or having a wash. Hope this helps. Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Joanne, Was just touched by your comments about your son and wondered if my experiences might be of any help. My children were 17, 16 and 9 when I was diagnosed. My youngest was in my class at school so keeping it all from her was not an option. I also had to have chemo first and it simply isn't possible to not let your kids see how that affects you. My sister went through all this ten years ago and one of the most important things she said to me was don't try to pretend everything's okay when it's not because the kids will pick up on it and then they'll worry because they think you're hiding something from them. It's the unknown that's the most scary. My son (17) has been completely laid back about it all. I told him about diagnosis and was all prepared for emotional melt down. He just said, ' Aunty Shirl had that and she's okay isn't she?' And that was it for him. It actually got quite annoying at times when he appeared almost indifferent to what was going on but for him that was the way he handled it. My daughter (16) just burst into tears and said 'I don't think I can live without you, mummy'. I told her I wasn't going anywhere which I wasn't. I lost my mum to cancer when I was 11 and I was absolutely determined that I was not going to leave my kids. I have a faith and when I was waiting for results I really felt God was saying to me 'You are held in the everlasting arms'. I didn't need to know anymore than that but I did say one thing back to God and that was, 'I'm NOT leaving my kids'. I'd go through anything but there was no way I would let them grow up without a mum. My 16 year old has found it most tough because she has seen me suffer through this and it has made her angry but we are coming out the other side and going shopping for prom dresses on Tuesday. I am going to see my beautiful girl go off to her first prom in a few weeks time! My younger daughter accepted what I told her which were the basic facts about each part of the treatment in bite-size bits as necessary. As I was having chemo first I told her I had something called cancer growing inside me and it was something that shouldn't be there. I was going to have some very strong medicine to make it go away and because it was so strong it might make other things happen too; I might be sick and my hair would probably fall out. Her reaction was kind of objective curiosity. I told her she could ask me anything and I would always try to answer her questions and also say if I didn't know the answer. She was fascinated by the whole hair thing. We went off for a major hat-buying expedition and throughout it all she's given me a running commentary on the progress of my hair - bald as a coot, silky stubble, and fluffy puppy have all been mentioned! She has helped me choose bras and is adept at knowing if I'm wearing my 'built-in boobs' or not. She saw me with drains in when I came home from hospital after surgery and said 'ooooo, that's a bit off-putting mum' which she was right about! She asked to see my scars a few weeks after the surgery and they were pretty settled by then so I let her and that was that. I suppose what I'm trying to show is that each child is different. Be confident in your knowledge of your child. You love him and you don't want him to be afraid so you will find the right way to tell him and learn to know how much to tell him. Whatever else you go through you are, first and foremost, his mum. You've always been great at that and that isn't going to stop because of your diagnosis. My little girl's matter of fact approach has actually given me more confidence to face the changes that have happened to me and I thank God for her. Sorry this has turned into an epic. Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Loulou, I did not have exactly the same chemo as you, had FECx3 then Tacx3 because they wanted to shrink the tumour and mop up any stray cancer cells. (Some were found in my lymph nodes at biopsy.) I started my chemo before I'd had an MRI or CT scan so went for about a month not knowing if I just had breast cancer or if it was all over my body - a very anxious time. My oncologist said that the treatment would be the same if cancerous cells were found elsewhere because the chemo would destroy cancer cells wherever they were in my body. She also said that finding cancerous cells in the lymph nodes did not necessarily mean the cancer had spread but that the lymph nodes were just doing their job and preventing the cells moving to other parts. My scans both came back clear and when I had my surgery four weeks ago (double mx + lymph node clearance in right side) no cancer cells were found in the lymph nodes so I think the chemo did a good job. I also had a lot of friends praying for me too! I think there is every reason to be hopeful and go with the treatment. I felt quite panicky initially when I started and felt like the doctors were trying to poison me but my sister, who went through all this 10 years ago advised me to trust the doctors and their advice about the best treatments. I am now cancer-free and will continue to take herceptin for the rest of this year to minimise any reccurrence. I hope this will help and I will be on this amazing community if you need any further support through the Tax. It was hard but there is life after it. Lots of love xxxxxxx",

Like you, my ECGs have always been carried out in a sensitive manner - not having a gown is just unacceptable. Perhaps once you've done something about it you may feel more empowered and less like the 'piece of meat' you described. I got tearful at my initial ultrasound when the doctor made a comment about the size of my breasts - something over which none of us have any control! I was able to make a comment about this via a patient survey and felt much better after doing so.

      "Content": "Hi there, Really sorry to hear that things have not gone as you hoped and that you're unable to get back on with normal life. I think all of us on here have felt the same. I went from diagnosis to chemo in a week. One moment I felt fit and was on a residential school trip with my class of 30, the next I was having IV drugs, about twenty tablets a day and felt unable to get out of bed for days at a time. It's not just the diagnosis and the following treatment but having to get yourself into a complete different mindset. My husband and I came up with the motto 'one day at a time' because for a while the day we were on was all we could cope with. I am someone who likes to plan ahead, take charge and be the one who sorts out other people's problems and suddenly I found myself in the opposite place which was difficult and frustrating. I found it hard to accept the position I was in because it almost felt like I was giving in to the cancer if I let it change the way I lived but there wasn't really any choice. Accepting where you are is not giving in and feeling the way you do is not weakness. I have now been off work for 6 months and have re-discovered lots of things I love on the many days I have felt well enough to enjoy them - playing the piano/violin, reading, knitting, lunches with friends. When you're a full-time teacher and mother of three you rarely get time to do any of these things so this has been a genuine opportunity for some quality 'me' time. Don't know if this helps or not - always tend to ramble on a bit. I didn't sign up on this community for ages because I didn't want to 'be a cancer patient' but there are loads of brilliant inspirational and practical people on here who are kind and funny and honest and it's really helped. Hope you find the same.",

      "Content": "Hi Kay, Have just read your post and know where you're coming from. I had double mx in March and now my scars are fully healed. I looked at myself immediately after surgery, looked at pics on line and my lovely sister who had the same thing 17 years ago showed me her scars so I thought I would be prepared which I was. I wasn't shocked and calmly kept looking each time I washed etc and thought I was absolutely fine with it but then one day in the bathroom about a month later I just felt overwhelming sadness and cried and at the moment, four months on, I still have days where I feel very sad for my body. I think it does take time to adjust. I'm the sort of person who just tends to get on with things and thnk 'it is what it is' so at first I revelled in being able to buy nice bras for the first time in my life (38C) instead of having to settle for whatever M&S had in 38G! I also enjoy running and it is very liberating, especially in this hot weather to not have to bother with any support but just to run free. But in the last couple of months I suppose I've realised this is a permanent situation and I have had real weepy moments again. As you say, swimming is a big deal. I love swimming and couldn't wait to get the all-clear from my bc to start again but when she said OK I still just put it off. We have a little 12ft splash pool in the back garden so I thought I'd try out in there first. I put on a swimming costume and still felt naked so also put on a T-shirt. Then I got in the pool very gingerly and cried because it felt different and also I've lost a lot of upper body strength and my arms are so weak at the moment. My little girl ( 9yrs) was an absolute sweetie. She was just so pleased her mum came in the pool to play with her and kept telling me 'it's alright Mum'. And the next day it felt a bit better. Then I ordered a really nice post-surgery swimsuit and water-proof boobs from Nicola. Jane and it felt better again. It is a bit weird seeing your costume drying on the line with boobs but it is what it is! We live on the Isle of Wight so we go to the beach several times a week during the school summer holidays. Again, I'd been putting off going worrying about changing etc but it really is just the same as before. My scars extend both sides under my armpits and have left a lump of skin there too which can bulge in some swimming costumes but with my new one that comes high under the armpits it conceals this so no one would know to look at me that I'm not the same as them. However, in this weather I'm not going to faff about with breast forms and just go without on the beach so bizarrely I put my boobs on to swim! Ideally, if I could get a swimming costume that fitted well with no prostheses I wouldn't bother. I have thought about reconstruction but it would be a massive step for me and I don't want to put myself through hours of surgery to make other people feel better. I also want to give myself time to live with and love the new me. Time is the thing and acknowledging your feelings and sharing them with people who love you and knowing you are a survivor and that you're beautiful because you're you not because of what you look like. Sorry this is so long but hope it helps. Lots of love, Wendy",

It was diagnosed as Phlebitis - inflammation of the vein - so I had antibiotics from my GP and was also given some Hirudoid gel to rub on four times a day. This is to relieve deep bruising. I found this quite good at relieving the soreness. I initially had a lump in my vein which the doctor said was a small thrombosis or clot and said it may take weeks to go away. It did hang around for quite a while but now, three months after chemo, it has gone. I have a slight ache in my arm when I fully extend it but apart from that it's back to normal. The vein that was damaged has disappeared so I guess it did burn out. My sister who had bc ten years ago said the same thing happened to her and veins that used to be there just disappeared. Hope this helps and you get relief soon. Lots of love.",

My bcn told me there was a counsellor available for me or any member of the family to talk to if we wanted to so this might also be available at your hospital.

It is settling down but I've still got a hard, tight layer under about half my scar and it still looks quite bruised. My bcn thinks it's fine but it is taking a long time. She said it may take months to finally settle down which is okay but I have days when it is really tender and as the weather gets warmer I'm wearing thinner tops which don't protect you from car seatbelts etc. I'm not wearing my prothesies at home because they tend to rub. I think if you can hold on and not get it aspirated that's probably the best option but only you know how you feel and what level of discomfort you can tolerate. I've just been back to the doctor and he's given me codeine tablets to take at night to help me get a bit more comfortable. This is definitely worth doing if your sleep is being disturbed. Hope you feel more comfortable soon. Lots of love.",

Also she can take paracetamol. I had my hair cut short just before chemo, my head felt bruised but not really painful. I also had my friend shave off what was left of my hair when it got really thin and surprisingly this made me feel better emotionally too, I think because I was actually in control of it going if that makes sense. hope this helps. lots of love, Wendy",

This was 17 years ago when treatment was nowhere near as good as it is today but even so, after double mx, chemo and radiotherapy she is still here, in complete remission and has seen her oldest son graduate and her daughter go off to university. She is leading a completely normal life and has a really good job too. Her success has given me the courage to face my own battle with bc (diagnosed Oct 13 and now slowly coming out the other side after chemo followed by double mx) and I am also confidently looking forward to a long life. My oldest son turns 18 tomorrow and in October I wasn't even sure if I'd be here to celebrate it with him. Now I'm looking forward to grandchildren waaaaaay further down the line! Hang in there Lucy.

I should feel on top of the world and I am so grateful for this outcome but I'm exhausted. I've been doing bits around the house and can cook meals and I started driving again at the weekend which is a god-send as we have three kids who need transporting all over the place but I am finding i can't get through the day without a sleep and when I lie down I'm out like a light and can sleep for up to four hours without moving. The problem us, I can't sleep at night. It takes ages to fall asleep and then I'm waking up 7 to 8 times during the night. I can't get comfortable as I've got lumps of skin under both armpits following surgery making side positions difficult and on my back I get back ache after about half an hour. I'm just waking up every morning feeling drained and low. I have read Bab's 'Feeling so low' post and that's pretty much me so will try to follow the advice on there but just wanted to talk to you lovely lot as feeling a bit miserable. Thank you.",

I had it quite badly after my surgery in March and it's now much better though it's still quite uncomfortable if I have to take off a shirt over my head. I generally exercise my arm lying on the bed then lift my bad arm up with my good arm, stretch it out as far as I can so it's just a little uncomfortable then try to stretch it 1 or 2cm further and concentrate on breathing to help with the discomfort. I repeat this three or four times each session and it has worked. Another exercise my bcn gave me was to put both hands together like you're praying and then raise your arms up slowly above your head ( or as far as you can go). I think there are videos available on this site to showing you exercises. Hope you get relief soon. Lots of love, Wendy",

I've done exactly the same over a specific spot on my spine which hurts. I know it's just wear and tear and is in the same spot where I fell and got sat on by a horse when I was 13 but at the back of your mind there's a question mark. The simple thing is to go to the dentist and let him/her cast an expert eye over it. A few years ago I had a lump on my top left gum. It didn't hurt and caused me no trouble but began to get bigger,. My dentist sent me up to the hospital dentist for an x-ray and it turned out to be an abscess even though it didn't hurt or anything. I did lose a tooth but it was safely removed and I've had no problems since. I've also had a polyps ( don't think I've spelled that correctly) which was a small lump just inside my lip. That was also removed quickly and painlessly without recurrence. So I guess what I'm trying to say is it could be a number of things which are definitely NOT cancer. Hope this helps.

There are several groups out there that might be worth considering when evaluating your marriage - Marriage Encounters is run by the CofE churches and there is also the Alpha marriage course run by churches who have run the Alpha courses that give people the opportunity to investigate Christianity. Both provide non-confrontational ways to discuss many aspects of marriage and you could do an internet search to find a group near you. Won't go on about this, just didn't want you to be left high and dry if it was someone you'd find helpful. Hope you come to a decision that's right for you. Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Emma, Had to reply as your experience is so close to mine. I had double mastectomy and right side lymph node removal the second week of March. I also had haematoma which needed to be syringed off twice to start healing. I'm now four weeks after surgery and still feel quite tender and achey across the chest and under both armpits. I am taking paracetamol and trying not to be slack with the exercises and this is helping but I'm not getting better as quickly as I thought I would which is frustrating. All the other advice is good - don't do too much and rest. I find I still need a good two hours sleep a day. Not driving is a big thing for me as I feel guilty that my heroic husband is having to taxi all three kids everywhere on top of a full time job. It also stops me getting out to see friends and I'm stuck in the house. I have had moments of feeling quite depressed especially as I'm not sleeping that well at night and wake up feeling tired and achey. Usually once I'm up I feel better. Sorry I've gone on a bit but wanted to say, don't give yourself a hard time or try to make yourself do more than you can. Some days you'll feel like your making progress and others you'll feel like your going nowhere. Hang in there, do your exercises and get plenty of rest. Let me know how you're getting on. Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Trudie, I absolutely get where you're coming from. I was diagnosed Oct 2013, had chemo then double mx in March and am just finally coming to my last two Herceptin. I'm a teacher and went back to work on phased return in September. Went from three mornings back to full time in five weeks and fortunately!V??! after two full weeks had another two weeks off for some revision of scars surgery. I've never looked forward to a hospital trip so much in all my life....anything to get a break from work. We had half term and then I was back into it. I managed three weeks struggling with colds, sore throats and headaches and finally gave in last week and had three days off to stay in bed even though all you do is worry about supply cover and falling further and further behind. I did have a mentor but that support has now gone so I have no alternative but to soldier on. I am knackered and feel tearful and unable to cope a lot of the time. Sorry to moan on about me but I so get where you're coming from. People keep advising me to take it easy and let things go but the expectations of those who think you're back in harness are very difficult to fight against. I feel like you that I will never be quite the same person again and feel that my husband will always be a bit disappointed. He's said to me I'm a lot more negative since the illness and he feels like he's got to get to know me all over again. I don't know what to do because I wasn't aware I was being negative. I just know I don't feel confident like I used to and that I never knew what fatigue was before this happened. Try not to get down about your garden or the rabbit - I have exactly the same concerns but it's winter now and everyone's garden goes to pot in winter.  Try and be kind to yourself - there's enough pressure from others without doing it to yourself. It's a long road out of the tunnel back to the light but we're both heading in the right direction. Lots of love, Wendy",

I don't have a crush on my consultant but I do think he is a hero and also a special mention for my surgeon, Mr Baboo ( or Mr Baboob as I call him). I had my 6 month follow up appointment for my double mx last Wednesday and explained I was a bit self conscious and uncomfortable with parts of my scars. He said he would be happy to sort this out and could do the small 40 min surgery on Friday!!!!!! As I'd only gone back to work the day before I talked him out of that one but I will be sorted in four weeks time. I think this is amazing and want to tell everyone how brilliant my team are!

I felt like I was really up-beat and coping well after my double mx but every now and then I have a low day, look in the mirror and have a bit of a weepy time. I don't see how you can not have these days. You bravely accepted what you had to do and are recovering but there's bound to be times when you're sad for your body and admitting that and having a cry to let it out is probably the best thing to do ( as well as coming on here and talking to all your friends who care about you).

      "Content": "Hi Jane, How many days into your FEC cycle are you? It's usual for your urine to be red for about 24 - 48 hours immediately after treatment, sickness can just be for the first two or three days or may last longer. Speak to your oncologist if you're having a bad time with sickness because they can give you other anti-sickness pills. Eat whatever you feel like, when you feel like it to keep your strength up. I used to take a bag of apple chunks to bed with me to chomp on if I got hungry because they wet your mouth, have a distinctive flavour that still tasted normal and were easy to digest. If your sleep pattern is disrupted try to go with the flow and not worry about it. Stressing in the middle of the night about not being able to sleep won't help you sleep any better. You can always catch up during the day. I started to lose my hair early on in the second cycle - a few hairs at first and then over about a week found I could pull out small chunks if I ran my fingers through my hair. Began to wear bandanas at about 5 weeks as hair getting very thin and eventually got my friend to shave my head as it was looking really odd. I was reading an old diary extract that I wrote at the time the other day and I was afraid to go to the shops on a windy day in case my hair just blew off! This, of course did not happen but it knocks your confidence at first. Your head may feel tender and bruised as the hair falls out. I gently massaged my head which helped a bit. I was very self conscious at first, imagining people would stare at me in my bandanas but I took myself off to M&S cafe to try and gauge whether this was the case or not and no one batted an eyelid or looked my way so I felt better after that too. Everyone who loves you will soon get used to you and that will help you feel much more comfortable in yourself. I'm now 4 months past chemo. Hair started to come back even while I was on Tax and it's now really furry - about 3cm all over. I also have my eyebrows and eyelashes and have had to start shaving my legs again! (There are a few good things about not having hair!) I've read quite a bit about hot flushes on this site and people cope in different ways. I drink lots of water, use a really light duvet and just toss it on and off all night. One lady suggested putting bottles of icy water in the bed beside her to cool down. Wear loose fitting cool cotton nightwear - I still wear stretchy stuff though as I feel a bit restricted in plain cotton PJs. I've never worked out whether or not the flushes were part of the side effects or not but I am almost definitely going through chemo induced menopause now so don't know how long this will last. There has also been a discussion on here lately about possible herbal remedies that might be useful but you'd need to read those as I know nothing about them. Sorry this is long but hope it's of use.

      "Content": "Hi Wendy d, Thinking of you at the mo and praying it will all go smoothly. Just a few practical ideas in answer to your questions. There is discomfort after the op, not pain. If you are in pain ask for medication. I was mostly fine on ibuprofen but first night after op (I stayed in 2 nights as needed blood transfusion) had some morphine. Wasn't so much a high as a lovely sinking into the mattress feeling. Slept brilliantly and woke up twelve hours later in the same position I went to sleep! The drain is a pain. I was constantly anxious I would catch it on something and pull it out but you don't. My hospital gave me a long handled cotton tote bag to put them in when moving around and this was quite useful when going to the loo and washing. Don't leave anything like that to the last minute as you are likely to be very slow to start with. Loads of pillows is a good way to get comfy. I had 1 in the normal position, then 2 in a v shape off the first and about 3 more on top of those in normal position so I was half sitting up but both arms supported. I also slept in a separate bed from hubby for a while because there wasn't really room for him alongside all the pillows! Experiment with building yourself a little cocoon. Do your exercises often to avoid stiffening up and to regain full shoulder movement and strength. I was a bit lax with mine and my shoulders are still quite weak 5 months on. Swimming is good once your scar has healed up but obviously be guided by your team over risk of infection etc. Hope this is useful. Always remember that everyone who loved you before still loves you after and you are beautiful. Lots of love, Wendy",

Those who choose the conventional route can be diagnosed, treated, have surgery and follow-up treatments and be out the other side in this time, albeit maybe having to take tablets for years to come. I am a conventional lady who was diagnosed in Oct 2013, hade 6 months chemo and then bilateral mx. Following the surgery in March my surgeon has told me they've got all the cancer. It's taking me a bit of recovery time but now, 6 months down the line, I am beginning to be in the position to get back to my normal life again. I have a husband, three children and a full time job and I need to get back on with my life. I don't really understand what you perceive to be the benefits of your approach. It seems to me your cancer is consuming your life anyway with all your energies being put into researching and waiting for second opinions and analysing every bit of information. I personally would rather spend time with friends, enjoy my family and hit the beach with my lovely re-modelled C- cup prothesies as soon as the weather warms up!",

I know it's really frustrating and sometimes you're so tired you don't know what to do with yourself but fighting to get to sleep just doesn't help. I spent many hours pacing the house in the dead of night, getting really good at making cups of tea without making a sound and also discovered BBCiplayer on my iPad - anything to keep myself occupied from worrying until nature took it's course, exhaustion set in and my body finally let me go to sleep. Try to just go with the flow and nap when you can. This is only temporary. I also used music a lot to help me relax, each to their own but Aled Jones always chills me out. Even if you can't sleep, if you can just lie down and listen to something calming you are giving your body a bit of a break. We're all with you honey and we do know how you feel and you will come out the other side. Lots of love, Wendy",

My hospital always administer first few Herceptin by drip so that if you do have a reaction to it, it can be stopped straight away. Once they're happy you're okay with it they can administer it by subcutaneous infection ( into the thigh in my case) but I still have to stay at the hospital for 2 hours afterwards so it doesn't shorten my appointment time. It is better in the fact that you're not hooked up to the pump for the two hours though. I think every hospital has it's own guidelines for how to administer Herceptin so this may not be the case in yours. Hope it all goes well for you though. lots of love, Wendy",

Who knows why bc happens to anyone but I know for sure it's not anything you've done! My situation is not the same as yours but I can tell you I decided against the cold cap for my chemo. For the following reasons: A) My onc said it may or may not work and there were no guarantees B) Once I saw the things (pink and black helmets that look a bit like neoprene diving caps) decided bald was probably the better option! C) You have to wear the cap for about 30 minutes before chemo starts and for a while ( not sure how long) after it and I didn't want to be in chemo for any longer than necessary, especially at the end of the session when I was tired and wanted to get home to bed. Don't mean to be flippant as I'm sure you don't feel like laughing at the mo. I was absolutely dreading the hair loss but for me the thinking about it beforehand was worse than it actually happening. I quickly got used to my head shape and found soft padded jersey bandanas were the most comfy things for me to wear. Don't know if this is useful or not but felt your lowness and wanted to let you know you're not alone and this is just a temporary setback. Lots of love.",

I had some pills to take at the chemo unit before having the IV. Are you being given anything just before? I also followed a good piece of advice which was to just take the tablets, don't wait until you feel sick. This is particularly important when you are beginning to feel better. Keep taking the meds! You will begin to feel better. I was on chemo every three weeks and with the FEC I felt vile for about a week, then spent a week picking up and for the third week I felt almost normal and went out to lunch with friends etc. Actually, felt quite guilty for not being at work!

I have been on half pay since mid March and really need to get back to work as soon as possible. My plan was to use this half term to go in on a voluntary basis to see what I could do and build up my hours with the idea that as soon as I could do more than 0.5 I'd go back to work. I planned on phased return and be back to full time in July. My problem is that it is now two days to half term and I still only seem able to do two hours taking small groups of children. I have to go home and have a sleep and I don't have the patience and resilience to cope with behavioural issues. I'm trying not to give myself a hard time but we have a mortgage that needs paying. My latest plan is to just bite the bullet and go back full time for July - it's still 6 weeks away - even if I just have to come home and go straight to bed. It's 1 4-day week, 2 full weeks and a 3-day week before the holidays so perhaps I'll be able to cope. I think it is worth trying to go in and do a few sessions to try out what you can do without any pressure. I suppose it also depends on what you will be doing. My class are covered until the holiday by the supply teacher so I wouldn't have to take my class but we've got OFSTED due and I really don't need that. I'm surprised at how vulnerable I feel which is not like me at all. Go by how you feel. You might find you can do more than you think but don't be surprised if you can't. Hope this helps.

I'm still not back at work officially yet because nobody told me what the protocol was and when I turned up at school half way through June with a fit note from my GP saying I could return to work on phased return from July, my head said no way until I'd been through occupational health. The earliest they could get me an appointment is this Friday (11th July)! I was hoping to do three mornings a week for July then get back to full time in September but I'll be lucky now if I get in at all before the summer holidays. I'm hoping now that I will be allowed back to work officially for August and still be able to do phased hours in September, after all we do not spend the summer sitting around on our backsides do we? I'm trying to stay calm about the OH appointment but don't relish talking to a total stranger about everything.

There are lots of things you mention that I can't be of help with but one thing I can reassure about is that you are entitled to reconstruction surgery on the NHS at anytime following mastectomy/lumpectomy. I had bilateral mastectomy six weeks ago and did not want to put myself through anymore surgery at that point so I am just sticking with prothesies ( probably spelled wrong!) for now. My breast care nurses have assured me that should I change my mind next month, next year or twenty years down the line I can still go back and request it. I don't know if there may be a medical reason why your team are not suggesting reconstruction but I will just add that there is also a very strong history of cancer in my family: grandma, mum and sister. My sister had her first diagnosis when she was 30 (17 years ago) and had a mastectomy but then the cancer came back on the scar site three years later. She was really glad she had not gone for reconstruction as she found the lump immediately and was able to get treated very quickly. Perhaps your team are being cautious as you've had what sounds like quite an unusual type of cancer. I hope I've not said anything to make you anxious. My sister is alive and well and cancer- free 17 years on and has just been brilliant helping me through mine. It must be so hard having to cope on your own but hopefully now you've found this site you won't have to. Lots of love and prayers, Wendy.",

      "Content": "Hi Sixpence, My experience is very similar to yours. My double mx was at the beginning of March and the follow up said they had got it all which was great news. Now I'm just on Herceptin for the rest of the year. I am having odd stabbing pains in my scar tissue and also have cording in my right upper arm which is very achey everyday although I try to stretch it as much as possible. I've also got the hot flushes and often have difficulty sleeping for the same reasons as you. I think you're right. When you are having your treatment, everyone knows you're unwell. Once you've been given the all clear and you're not going up to the hospital all the time people assume you're all better. I also feel guilty that I didn't feel like rejoicing when I got the all clear - just felt tired and sore. Everyone around me was excited but I didn't feel it. I think you're exhausted at the end of it physically and emotionally and, from what I've read from other lovely people on here, it can take up to a year to actually feel normal again. I've been trying really hard over the Easter holidays to do things with my kids and I have managed to but I can't wait for them to go back to school because I need a rest now. I feel afraid to say when I'm feeling well, which I do for part of every day now, in case people think I'm 100% and expect more from me than I can cope with. I'm afraid they'll think I'm putting it on if I need to stop or rest or say I can't do it. I'm a teacher and am now on half pay having been off work since October. I've made the decision that, this being the case, it doesn't make sense to go back to work until I can do more than half a week so for the next few weeks I'm going to go in on a voluntary basis and find out what I can do, what I've got the stamina for and I can just go home when I've had enough. There's no room for weakness when you're in charge of 30 9- year- olds so I've got to know I can do it before returning properly. Fortunately my head teacher is okay with this. Sorry this is really long. Hope it helps. Lots of love.",

      "Content": "Hi Floridachick, I'm in exactly the same position and stage as you. We must have been diagnosed at the same time and have the same type of cancer. I have just begun to feel like I've got a bit more energy and am trying to negotiate phased return to work (I'm a primary school teacher). Have just started going in on a voluntary basis to se what I can do. Managed a whole day today Helping out in two classrooms and taking a couple of small groups. I managed but sat down on the bed when I got home and fell asleep for three hours! Woke up feeling stiff and achey all over but this does generally ease up as I get moving. I am making progress but it is slow. I think I'm just going to keep trying things out and try to do 'rest days' in between busy days to give myself time to recover if I've done too much. If you get frustrated, tank back to how you were straight after surgery and you'll be surprised how far you've come. Lots of love, Wendy",

It's bound to happen when you're only nibbling on stuff you fancy which, let's face it, is very unlikely to be carrot sticks. I 've put on about 2 stone since last October and it's only now, 4 months after chemo and 2 months after surgery that I've actually got the will to try and diet. You will get there but at the moment you're fine as you are. Everybody loves you and your body's hanging on to every goody it can get its hands on to help you fight and get better. Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Lindy, Don't know if you've been told about ESA - it's an allowance you can get from the DofWP? (can't remember what it's called now!) anyway, I didn't think I'd be eligible as I work as a teacher and am better off than a lot of others. We struggled though when my statutory sick pay stopped and I went down to half pay. I was eligible for ESA once my statutory sick pay ran out and I think we got about £200 per fortnight. I'm sorry to be so vague about this but the point is that if you are in employment you are likely to be eligible for this allowance. I went to the job centre and did an application for it over their free phones and then had to send them notification from my payroll that my statutory sick pay had stopped. I don't know if this is of use to you but it might be a ray of hope. Definitely worth looking in to anyway. Just be warned, if you do apply you'll end up receiving notification in triplicate! (Not doing much for the rain forests!) Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, I can completely relate to this. I finished chemo in January and then had double mx in March. I'm a teacher and went back to work on phased return in September but am now back up to full time and I'm absolutely knackered. I started off with sore throat, then had thumping headaches and some weird digestive ache, now I'm on head cold with persistent annoying cough and runny nose. My skin is also dry and cracking and I feel generally under the weather and run down. Fridays have become a wipe-out zone for me. I come home, sit on the settee and can't move. Sometimes I just go to bed without tea because I'm too tired to eat. My advice would be, if you don't have to work yet, don't. Wait until you're feeling more yourself.  Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, Docetaxel does affect your nail bed and you need to look after your nails to avoid infection. Lots of ladies paint their nails a dark colour to protect them but I tended to wear gloves. If you are doing any cleaning (like you really feel like it!) wear protective gloves. You can also gently massage in nail moisturiser too. I'm sure lots of other ladies will add to this thread to give you good advice. It is quite likely you will lose your finger and toe nails but this tends to happen gradually and the top layer sort of flakes off but there is new nail underneath, you're not left with exposed nail bed. It also takes quite a lot of time to work through your system. I finished chemo in early Feb and my finger nails are almost back to normal now but my toenails are still not too pretty. Just hang in there and you'll be okay. Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Lisaf, Don't ever feel silly for asking questions on here; it can be like learning a new language! Tax refers to Taxotere or Docetaxel which are other chemo drugs ( might be different names for same drug, I think - ask your oncologist ). When I was starting chemo I got given some information sheets about the drugs I would be having which explained a bit about how they worked and possible side effects. I think all this info is available on the information part of this site so you could do a search for the name. I only got the info sheet about Tax just before I started that bit of my treatment because I think the staff don't want to give you too much at once or create anxiety. Hope this helps. I don't know if you're the original post and you are 28 but if you are, my sister was first diagnosed when she was 29. She has had to have treatment three times but is now 48, still in the clear and is leading a massively full-on life as well as holding down a high-powered job in our lovely NHS so be encouraged. Treatment has come a long way too since she was diagnosed. Lots of love, Wendy",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, This has been on my mind too. I love swimming and certainly need to get back to it to loosen up and strengthen my shoulders following double mx but I am lacking in confidence to go and do it. I have my silicone prothesies now and my bcn said to wear them in a bra under my batho to ensure they stayed in place. She said this was better than just putting them into pockets in a post-surgery batho because in the water your boobs can drop away from you. I think I'm going to try the bra under combo and then have another bra with my softies in it to change into afterwards to save fiddling around with the silicone ones in the changing room. Fortunately our pool was recently upgraded to include lots of individual changing rooms ( it used to be one big communal room.... Nightmare!). Please let me know how you get on because I need a push to get me down to that pool. Lots of love, Wendy",

I am okay once I get moving but it can be hard to get out of bed in the morning and I walk about like a very old lady for about the first 20 minutes until everything loosens up. Once I'm moving I'm not in pain but my hips are a bit dodgy. I can't really stride out when I walk or they feel like they're going out sideways - weird, hard to explain the feeling. My oncologist said if it got to the point where I sieze up she'll take me off it for a bit but I don't really want to do that and I don't need to at the moment. I've just gone back to work as a teacher 3 weeks ago and I'm getting really tired. If I lie down on the settee when I get home I need my husband to pull me off it again - I just get stuck. I thnk it's my body's way of saying 'slow down'. Anyway, seem to be rambling on again but hope you know you're not the only one who feels about 95 in the mornings. Lots of love, Wendy",
