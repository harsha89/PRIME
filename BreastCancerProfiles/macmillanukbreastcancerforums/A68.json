      "Content": "Was in utter shock when called for return appointment after mammogram. Was told that there were differences from my last one, in left breast. Had more pics taken and then ultrasound. The man who did it said there was a cyst (which subsequently burst while he was taking a biopsy) and also took two more biopsies from something near it and put a titanium marker. The word cancer wasn't mentioned but I think he might have said scar. I don't know how I would have a scar there. Was asked to make an appointment for results but as I was going on holiday (where I am now) they said they would send me a letter. A couple of days ago, I received a phone call from automated patient services saying I have an appointment at the breast surgery clinic. This has thrown me into a panic. I rang the hospital to ask if that meant I was going to be given surgery and was told it was a results clinic. I got someone to send me a pic of the letter and it says that I have an appointment with a member of the breast surgery team. Does this mean that I definitely have cancer and they need to discuss surgery immediately? I'm very confused. Clinic code is BRCNAR and I'm assuming that this stands for breast cancer. I've been on HRT for nearly a year and wasn't told to stop taking it at follow up.  Any thoughts or comments welcome. My appointment is early afternoon on Wednesday. Strange to think that this time next week I might know that I have cancer. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Well they think it has the features of atypical hyperplasia BUT they\u2019re not sure so need to go back for a vacuum biopsy next week and wait another week for results again as could be DCIS. Should know where I stand by 20th June. Positive but not as positive as I would have liked.  I\u2019ve read lots of stuff about it being benign but feel quite down about the fact that I\u2019ve got a diagnosis of BC hanging over me forever. Have now decided that I\u2019ve felt a large moveable lump on the rib bone at the top of my other breast but surely if that was a issue they\u2019d have picked it up at last month\u2019s mammogram. I might ask when I go for biopsy next week. Do you think they\u2019ll check for me? Consultant said it might very well be HRT related even though I\u2019ve not had it a year yet.
