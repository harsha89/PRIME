      "Content": "flute_dog I quite agree - it's strange, and not very pleasant but after 10 weeks it is either going or I'm getting used to it!  To start with I also had weird tickly feelings like ants running over the skin and the BCN said that was normal too.  Other people have discussed on this site the feeling of a cold drink running under the new implant as well.  I suppose it's all completely different and we must expect to be surprised!  ",
