      "Content": "Pennymoon hi all,  Does anyone have any tips on things to eat that might not aggravate a throat utterly raw and shredded? I'm swigging the Difflam (shudder), sipping Cherries & Berries squash and overdosing on Clarnico Mint Creams. Everything seems to dry my mouth out and contribute to the raw sandpaper feeling. Worst mistake last night was a Bacon, Marmite, Philly and Cucumber sandwich (my favourite), but the pain was excruciatin! Tried custard and apple pie filling for breakfast...custard sort of coated my throat but made me feel nauseous.  Costa Strawberry Cooler is ok, but a bit sickly as all I can taste is the sugar! i use Biotine mouthwash which is great as it stops the mouth becoming dry and is very easy on the mouth. You can buy it from most pharmacies I think and it's also on Amazon and Living Better with Cancer website",

      "Content": "Boudicca1970 I'm sure this question has been asked a million times sorry! But which is my best option of vein, PICC or port? I have read horror stories on FB cancer pages for all 3 options so a I thought I'd ask the question on here. I'm seeing the chemo nurse today ahead of my first chemo session on Thursday! No matter how strong and positive I try to be the fear is rising! Any links to previous threads or posts or comments gratefully received thanks :-)  i personally preferred the cannula as I didn't want to go to hospital each week to have the picc line flushed out. I felt the cannula was best as I could then forget about Chemo for the next three weeks after I left each session.  I also ha e narrow veins but still found the cannula best as the nurses are so well practised in inserting them. Please don't worry, you'll be fine.",

I finished Chemo back in March and now have Herceptin injections until December. It's a daunting prospect at the start because it's the unknown. All I can say is that you probably won't experience all of the side effects, I for instance did not suffer with nausea or sickness. It is doable and I just kept reminding myself that Chemo was my friend, making the cancer go away. Good luck and never be afraid to ask for support. Listen to what your body tells you. X",
