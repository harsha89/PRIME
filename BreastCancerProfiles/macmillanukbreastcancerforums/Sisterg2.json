      "Content": "Hello I hope it's ok to post another question. I found the support after posting last week fantastic so thank you ladies! Feel much more positive and am turning the energy I was using to worry to now fight this head on!  I am having lymph node clearance on Thursday and just wondered what pain relief people found helpful so I can get prepared. Also how long before it is usual to be able to drive etc? I know everyone is different but I'm not sure what to expect. I was so shocked when I was at the clinic I forgot to ask the usual questions!  Any help much appreciated.  Sarah ",

      "Content": "Hello Thank you so much for your reply. That is a good idea about getting some neuropathic painkillers, I think I may get them in just in case as my op is Thursday afternoon so of course it will be hard to get something over the weekend should I need it.  Thanks again.  Sarah ",
