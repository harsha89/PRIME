      "Content": "Thanks for that Gail. I am pretty sure it will be down to radiotherapy. It's just that it seems to be getting bigger and more uncomfortable. I'm going for my two year check in three weeks so I'm hoping they can put my mind to rest, but more importantly my husbands! My sister and my friend in work were both diagnosed at the same time as me and they don't seem to have lumps but I thought it was worth asking whether anyone on here had experienced anything similar. Many thanks Judith",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy to remove a 7mm tumour two years ago. Within a year, a small lump appeared below my breast, almost on my first rib. It makes it very uncomfortable to wear any kind of bra as it seems to slide into the dip between my breast and rib. When I asked the breast cancer nurse she simply looked at it and said it was a reaction to radiotherapy. However, it's now two years on and the lump is bigger and causing a lot of discomfort.  Has anyone else ever experienced the same issue? I'm wondering whether it's scar tissue? ",
