      "Content": "Hello. Myself and sister both had double MX this year (different health authorities). My sister went for immediate implants with mesh. I think a lot of the time this works really well but my surgeon did say that there is a certain degree of risk with that procedure. Like you, she unfortunately had scars that wouldn't heal. Was off work for 3 months and on antibiotics for two months and at one point surgeon thought one of the implants would fail. In the end (to her surprise) they managed to save it but she lost both nipples. I'm a bit more of a worrier plus have just finished chemo and also have an ongoing blood clotting problem so went in the end for expanders rather than mesh etc. My surgeon advised me this is an older procedure and  whilst it is more hassle and possibly doesn't look as good in the end you are  less likely to have problems with healing. The expander is totally under the muscle - ouch - but that means you don't get that thin/stretched skin over the implant issue (my sister thinks this was the cause of her problems). My op was 12 days ago and though it looks a bugger it has healed really well (despite chemo and clotting problems). Still a bit sore but out walking dog every day last week. Not sure if this is of any use but thought I'd share our experiences - maybe in case you have a break from it all then think about revisiting it. Anyway, Good luck with it all CB ",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm after advice re travel insurance (seen a few posts on here -  I'm not the only one thinking about hols!). I've had quotes from Staysure and Allclear and declared my BC under prexisting conditions. Offered me OK prices but neither will cover for any future issues with BC - so eg if I had a reoccurance and had to cancel wouldn't be able to claim. Has anyone got insurance that covers for this eventuality? ",

      "Content": "Hello all thanks for your comments. I'm not having any problems getting cover for BC as a pre existing condition it's just that all the quotes I've had say in the pesky small print that any claims to do with future BC 'issues' won't be covered - so they will only cover you for anything NOT BC related. Looking for any advice as to how to get cover they would cover future BC issues. Hope that makes sense! ",

I Did an online quote 2 months ago with all clear - said could cover (and was quite cheap) but not for future BC issues. Think will call them direct and have a chat as they obviously do cover for future BC issues - my diagnosis was only last oct so maybe that's something to do with it. X ",

      "Content": "Hello maxine2 Thanks for that reply - really helpful. Sounds like you've still got a way to go with things - hope it all goes well.  It was good to hear that your sis is doing well with the implants. I don't know if mine will be skin saving or not (tbh don't know when it can/can't be saved) but will def loose the nipples. Nice to hear also that you don't have too much trouble with the muscle stretching bit - that's one of my main worries.  You've still got lots of treatment to go which must be tough but for me, I'm at the end of mine. I think that's one of my probs - if I have no reconstruction I could start to feel 'normal' (hopefullly!) in a few weeks but the reconstruction could drag on feeling rough for months. But maybe I need to think less about the immediate and more about the long term. It's just that, like many of us I'm sure, I used to love running about like a mad thing juggling kids, pets, job and everything else and just want to get back to all that!",

      "Content": "Hello mistymoley Glad that your reconstruction went well. My BS only uses the temporary expanders that are then swapped for implants. At first I thought I'd just be off work for maybe 4 weeks (all being well) but now worried that I've got the totally wrong end of the stick and it could be months and months. Getting in a right old pickle about what to do. This will sound daft, but this stage (i.e. Thinking about mastectomy) has been worse mentally than diagnosis, lumpectomy and chemo.

Part of wanting to rush back to work is wanting to 'get back to normal' but I need to realise I think that things will never be the same after all this! I suppose taking 1 month off or 3 months off is splitting hairs in the overall scheme of things. PS glad to hear the reconstruction went well for you CB x ",

Having second thoughts about it (which is not good for my state of mind!).  'Good news' stories about this type of procedure seem to be few and far between. Would love to hear any positive stories (as well as bad!). Also, any thoughts on amount of time off work would be much appreciated! Thanks CB",

That's annoying that you lost one of the original implants due to infection - I get the impression that none of these procedures are straightforward! It was reassuring to hear that the expander hasn't been a huge problem. Just wondered, why do you need 2 new implants putting in? Is it so they will match? Hope it all goes well next week CB x ps I'll look at that website! ",
