      "Content": "Ronstar - I can really empathise with your shoulder problems.  I've had ongoing shoulder problems pre cancer - I broke my right shoulder 5 years ago, had surgery on it 18 months later, then had a nerve block 18 months after that - all this time having regular Physio.  The nerve block eventually worked giving me a good range of movement, then I developed problems in my left shoulder - probably due to overuse while my right side was out of action.  I'd been having Physio on my left shoulder since earlier in 2016, had a steroid injection to reduce inflammation, just started intensive Physio then was diagnosed with left side breast cancer.  I've really really tried to keep up with the post surgery exercises and saw a Physio at the hospital who treats breast cancer patients - it hasn't helped that I fell on Boxing Day and landed on my left arm!   I've not started radiotherapy yet, had my planning appt yesterday and found both shoulders really hurt when in the armrests.  The radiologist suggested I take painkillers an hour before my sessions.  I don't know whether you're on other medication, but I take amitriptyline which does seem to help a bit with the pain. Must admit that I am a bit worried about the joint pain as a side effect of the anastrozole, although I've not had issues yet, only mega hot flushes and night sweats, nausea, indigestion and headaches!  Jane",

      "Content": "Jojo4 So no sleep last night, panicked all day then strangely calmer this evening.  Now just got in bed and the terror has arrived again.  I've convinced myself that because I have very very large breasts (38jj) I didn't find my lump until it was at least 6cm and that means that it will be the very worst news.  US can't see anything in LN but I'm now panicking over that and what may be revealed in surgery.  I really want to get off this roller coaster.  Nights are always the worst - I already take a drug called amitriptyline at night for nerve pain, but it usually helps me sleep, however I have been at my highest dose for the last month and managing an hour or two if I'm lucky. Following the, in my mind, devastating news I had on Monday, the day I had my preoperative assessment and date of 25th November for surgery, when I received a call to say they had re-looked at my MRI scan and I needed MRI guided biopsy on a suspicious area in my other breast, I spoke over the phone to my GP who has added another medication to take at night, and I'm now having 4-5 hours which is better.  I'm still struggling with constant anxiety during the day and struggling to eat, even chocolate!, which isn't good especially as people keep giving it to me.   Work was my saving grace for the first few weeks, I work in a busy school environment, and it was a welcome.  However, since Monday I have had to make the decision to take time off. My current mental state means I am really struggling to function normally. Even cooking tea last night felt like a mountain to climb.  I'm wondering whether the GP will prescribe something to take during the day just to stop the horrible adrenaline feeling in my tummy. Love this forum as can share mutual experiences and realise I'm not alone..",

My poo was also bright green when I eventually opened my bowels post surgery!  My breast still has a bright blue patch on it 5 weeks post surgery.  It's now accompanied by the little black tattoos ready for my radiotherapy to start - just looking forward to the red skin as well from the radiotherapy!

They've both dealt with it differently.  My older child has dealt with it on a practical level, using his medical background, but has also been contacting more than usual, just to check in.  My younger child seems to be keeping her feelings to herself, although she is popping home from London for the weekend to, in her words, use up a train ticket. My problem is talking about it to my elderly parents, both in their mid 80s and my mum with quite severe memory issues.  I feel my dad has enough on his plate dealing with mum without me causing further worries.  However, I felt I needed to say something as, obviously if I need chemotherpy I will change visually.  At the moment I have said that a small lump was identified during a routine mammogram, which is true, and that they want to remove it to be on the safe side.  My dad did say, is it benign or malignant, and I just said it is might be malignant. Due to lots of issues regarding scans and biopsies my surgery has been postponed, so I will just give them enough information to be honest but not to go into too much detail.",
