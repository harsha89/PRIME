      "Content": "Hi there, thanks for the advice. I was given some exercises by the physio nurse at hospital. I am doing them religiously even though it hurts a bit because after the first op they really helped. I saw the surgeon today, he said I should keep doing the exercises and just try to be patient. As you say, it takes time but we will get there. Now I have to concentrate on the chemo that starts In four weeks...I am dreading it! Thanks a lot for your kind words. It is very comforting to talk to people that have gone through similar experiences. Take care. xx",

      "Content": "Hello, I am sorry you are feeling so much pain today. Your experience sounds really close to mine. My biopsy also turned out two out of three and then I had a second surgery to remove more tissue from the breast and clearance of the lymph nodes remaining. That was two weeks ago. The pain is still quite intense and it is exactly as you described it,dull ache with nipping sensations that are quite strong and intense. Are you trying to do your physio exercises? The doctors and nurses yesterday told me I should keep doing them. That the best thing is to try hard and use your arm as normal as possible. Easier said than done!! But I am giving it a go... I was planning to go bak to work next week for a couple ,of weeks before the chemo starts, now not so sure. We must keep fighting, that's for sure. And some posts here are very encouraging. Take care of yourself. Keep in contact. Gentle hug ;)",

Yesterday went ok, shall I say,although my veins were playing up and I have a big bruise now in my hand to accompany the one still there from the anesthesia last time. Never liked needles very much which is so unfortunate as pretty much everything revolves around needles now! And the waiting game is on again :/ Have a good time at the garden centre. Lovely day for it ;) xxxxxx",

And it is a lot to do with the nerves repairing themselves from what I have read here in some posts. Sorry to hear about your wound; it's all about patience this long healing process! And even though it must be uncomfortable to have a drain, as you say, it is better than having the fluid building up inside you. I have this big soft lump under my arm, which I am not sure if it is part of the swelling after surgery or fluid building up...it is confusing because it is still numb so it feels weird anyway. I only had a drain in hospital and it was taken off when they send me home the next day. I am having the scan because I had five out of 28 in total (biopsy+clearance) affected, so no escape ;) I am looking forward to trying the different suggestions for sleeping tonight. What a difference a good night sleep can make! You sound a bit more cheerful today. Take care xxx",

As George said, the side effects are a lot more manageable. You get some of the ones listed for docetaxel but not as severe. I've just finished six weekly rounds of taxol and apart from being increasingly tired and short of breath with the smallest effort, it has been fine. Any questions you may have, just ask.

And yes it takes about 30 minutes. Then it's an hour for the actual paclitaxel. I hope that helps a bit...the oncologists will be able to tell you exactly why and if it is dangerous to miss one of them. The chemo nurse told me they give you piriton to prevent an allergic reaction...ah. And they also gave me anti-sickness pills before. Take care xx",

They check your blood count every week just before your chemo session. That's what they did in my case. The other good thing is that you don't get the injections they usually send with docetaxel to boost up your immune system. They weren't very painful but its one less extra hassle. Take care xx",

And Jane, thank you for mentioning your nails getting stronger after 18 months. That's exactly when I finished my treatment. I was in the chemo club of April-August 2014. I've been slowly growing back my hair, learning to cope with the annoyances of taking tamoxifen, et cetera but also going back to work, enjoying life, sending my daughter to uni - she was such a star supporting me all the way through from diagnosis, surgery, chemo and radio. My finger nails are still brittle and break easily but I'm hoping they'll start getting stronger soon too. Toenails unfortunately grew back like claws. Not a nice look for sandals Another lady here said it is doable, because we have to do it. If not, then what? Lizzie, I hope things go okay for you. As someone else said, it is like childbirth. It's a different experience for everyone. But the main thing to remember is that your treatment is going to make you better in the end. Good wishes to everyone!",
