Well done for continuing at work; distraction is great but it is ok to scream, cry, behave erratic, laugh but put yourself first. I'm saying all this as a nurse but am not heeding my own advice; write down notes, take someone to appointments, dont read too much online unless fab groups like this. You dont have to be strong for others, thats their responsibility. contact me again if u want a rant or if u have questions - am here.",

Very restricted in what i can do, abdo very tight, boobs very tender, the itch/tingling feeling which i assume is the healing process isnt the nicest sensation! I cant concentrate on reading but beginning to think about arranging some visitors! As everyone says, we are all different and just need to take one day at a time! Pathology results for me 2norrow so that'll be another hurdle! Be kind to yourself!",

Hubby did a great job trying to source but with hols and stock sizes, i wish i'd bought a couple more (kept tags & receipts) as my surgeon requested a bra on asap to be worn 24hours, i needed a few changes due to slight soakage!

Days 1&2 were hard but each day after gets easier. I long to hug my kids but cant the way i used to at the moment but it will return.  I'm a theatre nurse and know this op is performed regularly. You will get the best care and attention; just do everything you are told and your little one will be back on your lap in no time. I feel if it were me today, i'd manage a little careful cuddle; think my family appreciate me more now ive been away. Focus on getting through one day at a time. Good luck x",
