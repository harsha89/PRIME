      "Content": "In October 2014 I found out that I had breast cancer and since then I have had a lumpectomy a mastectomy a reconstruction and a tummy tuck as they used the fat and skin from my tummy to do reconstruction I am now recovering and being well looked after by my loving husband who has been my rock although I am glad and relieved by all that has happened I sometimes just burst into tears and sob uncontrollably please could anyone tell me if this is normal. I am wondering if this is because everything has happened so fast and if I should go and talk to someone about this looking forward to hearing from anyone else who has or still is going through this Many thanks Sandy",
