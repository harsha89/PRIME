      "Content": "Hi pgtips First DIEP does not use any muscle so this has no effect on your tummy muscle. The TRAM reconstruction does though. I had a mastectomy and immediate DIEP reconstruction in 2017. Unfortunately the reconstruction failed within 24 hours and inspite of attempts to save it it was removed within days. The op was about 11 hours long and my recovery was hampered by a pulmonary embolism. DIEP  requires very skilled microsurgery and it is this which can lead to failure (as in  my case).  So i was left with a huge scar from hip to hip and no left boob. I was devastated.  14 months later I had an LD flap reconstruction. Still a lengthy op oof about 6/7 hours but everything went well. I had lipofill from my thighs to supplement the LD and my right boob uplifted at the same time. Recovery has been really quick with good movement in my arm though the nerve endings in my arm are still tender. But I believe these take 6 -12 months to recover. If I had my time over I would choose the LD flap and not the DIEP. The chances of success are better and recovery is quicker. There were other factors involved which maybe made the LD more successful - different surgeons, different hospital, better nursing aftercare, I lost weight to reduce my BMI to improve my experience of General Anaesthetic (I wasnt obese but a bit overweight). Between both surgeries I met with several surgeons each with their own speciality of reconstruction. I wish I'd done this before my first op but hadnt realised I could. I hope some of this helps.",

If you are willing to share I am curious to know how you are and whether you have decided to have another kind of reconstruction. My mx and failed DIEP were only done in September so early days for me to decide. I am using this time to decide reconstruction vs  no reconstruction, and which type of reconstruction. I have sent you a friend request should you prefer to share your experience since March privately. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Tingk i had a mastectomy and (failed) DIEP reconstruction in September 2017. After much research and speaking to lots of breast and plastic surgeons I had LD (successful) reconstruction in Nov 2018 with some lipofill to make up to the correct size. Lipofill is very painful immediately post surgery - my op was done under general anaesthetic but local anaesthetic injections to the tops of my thighs helped hugely. I was very bruised and even now if I rub the tops of my thighs they are sore. I also had dog ears at ends of my DIEP abdominal scar which have been tidied up by taking lipofill from here too. All looking good but 8 weeks post op I\u2019ve been told that it is likely I\u2019ll need more lipofill in a few months time - it is recommended to wait 4-8 months post op for swelling to go down, and to allow the lipofill to dissipate. This will be done under anaesthetic too. At the same time as LD reconstruction and lipofill to one breast I had the other breastlifted and some lipofill used there too in an effort to get symmetry. I\u2019m not sure how long lipofilling (fat transfer) on its own takes as it was done at the same time as the LD (8 hours total) but I imagine it might take a couple of hours as the fat is extracted and put through a process before being injected. I\u2019m really  pleased with the results, and using my own tissue gives everything a natural look and feel. Good luck and feel free to ask me anything else.",

Unfortunately my new boob failed almost immediately and I was in and out of theatre to try and save it before losing it co okeyely 4 days later. Having a new boob and tummy tuck were to be like compensation but things didn't go to plan. I am now revisiting reconstruction but will wait at least 6 months to allow healing, both physical and mental. To be honest I don't really like what I see in the mirror but I can wear the same type of clothes as I've always worn.  I was given a soft prosthesis in hospital which I still  use when exercising as it's lightweight. I have since been fitted with a proper prosthesis. With good bras no one would know. I got fitted in M&S last week and a really lovely lady helped me to find a couple of bras. They are so comfy! More so than any other bra I've ever had!. I also have a knitted knocker for swimming but haven't tried it out yet. I have another health condition (relating to my immune system and eyesight) and the medication I'm on could be a problem for further surgery but I'm exploring options. I'm not very keen on implants so the LD flap is my top choice - but not at the expense of coming off my medication and losing my eyesight. I guess it's all relative. We are all individual and different things matter to us. But I do recommend giving yourself time to heal and adjust.  Best wishes",

Anyone have any experience of this or know people who have had it?

Lots of people decide not to have recmstruction. I knew right from the start that I wanted reconstruction. I saw  it as recompense for losing a breast. Unfortunately my new breast failed almost straight away (DIEP) and 6 months down the line I am considering my options. If I choose reconstruction then LD is my top choice. But I had post op pneumonia and a PE, plus I have lupus. So I'm wary about making a decision. If you really aren't sure, you can go ahead with the surgery and consider reconstruction later. The Someone Like Me service at Breast Cancer Care is brilliant. You can speak to people who decided not to have rrconstruction and people who have had various forms of reconstruction. Best wishes.",

After my mastectomy and (failed) DIEP reconstruction I went to a BCC Moving Forward class where a different topic was discussed each week with guest speakers. A nutritionist came one week and basically she said that a balanced diet is best rather than particularly cutting any one food group out. A statistic she did give though really caught my attention - for anyone with a cancer diagnosis with excess weight to lose - by losing 10lb the risk of cancer recurring is reduced by btwn 25 and 40%. I was a little overweight but not obese. Having had a failed reconstructive surgery and a post op pulmonary embolism, and seeking to have further reconstructive surgery, hearing this statistic spurred me on to lose some weight. I joined a slimming group; took up Pilates and started cycling. I lost just under 20lb - I feel so much better and my reconstructive surgery in November was a success, and recovery so much quicker with no post op clotting. I'm not saying all this was down to losing weight by any means, but I believe it contributed to a better experience. Plus, after so many things which were out of my control it was good to have something that I could control - my weight..I am probably still classed as a little overweight but I'm not stressing about that.  How did I do it? I switched to wholemeal rice, pasta, etc. I swopped bread for pitta, quit chocolate and crisps, swopped a lunchtime sandwich for soup. Honestly there was nothing scientific about it. The only food group I've reduced is sugar,  but I still eat the occasional bar of chocolate or slice of cake and manage to maintain my weight with little effort. The other thing I have cut out over the last few months is alcohol. I've never been a big drinker anyway but having read about the link between alcohol and cancer I decided to cut it out. Whatever you do it has to be sustainable in the longer term - not just a quick fix which you can't maintain.Have you been to see your gp for advice? There are many schemes through the NHS to support patients to lose weight. I wish you all the best.",
