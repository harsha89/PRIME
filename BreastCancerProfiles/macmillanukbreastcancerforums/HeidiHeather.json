    "Content": "I am also a vegetarian and have been on letrazole for 4 years. It was the second or third pill that I tried. It has less side effects for me. Sometimes the bone pain is excruciating. However, the pain was worse on other pills.  I stretch and walk a lot. This seems to alleviate the pain more than anything. I take 1500 mg of calcium and 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 each night.  At times I have been twisted into a pretzel with pain. That\u2019s how I discovered that walking and stretching helps the pain.  If I push myself to do too much, I get kidney stones from taking so much calcium, so I also drink lots of lemon water. The lemon helps dissolve the stones. Occasionally I get down with a bad cold. Sleeping 8 hours each night helps keep me healthy. Before cancer, I slept 5-6 hours a night. ",
