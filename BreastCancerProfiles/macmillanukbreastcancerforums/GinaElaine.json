      "Content": "I had my op last Friday for breast cancer, they removed the lump and some glands, I was allowed home the following day without a clue on what to do next, I was given no pain relief, no antiboc,or anything as I left the hospital. This morning I have woke and the inside of my underÂ  arm towards my elbow is so painful, and to be honest have no idea what to do, ring hospital or doctor, I rung my key worker yesterday over something else and as always am still waiting for a call back, I don't feel I have had any support at all during this difficult time. In fact more that i've been so messed about and stressed out. Sorry to go on but this is all new to me and I don't understand what is going on inside me and why this pain. Thank you for any help you may be able to give me . Gina",
