      "Content": "Hi, I think it's a great attitude you have!! I've worn scarves, don't really feel comfortable in my wig, even though it's nice! Haven't been brave enough to go out bald ((it's only been 2 weeks) until Wednesday I had to go to A&E as have got a blood clot in my arm (picc line) I was in so much pain didn't even think about my lack of hair!!  Did get a few sympathy looks, but now feel more confident to go out locally with my bald head!! We've got nothing to hide!!  My family and friends have said how much I suit it!! Best wishes to everyone who is going through these difficult times xxx",
