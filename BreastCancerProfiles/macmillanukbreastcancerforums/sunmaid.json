    "Content": "Hi Tessa, What a way to land a modeling stint, lol. My son (18 yrs. old) had DVT in the leg a couple of weeks ago. It started with ankle swelling and we thought it was a sprain so we put cold compress and told him to elevate it. The next day, even his foot was swollen and there was redness and bruising on his ankle. We brought him to an orthopedic doctor who ruled out sprain and diagnosed DVT, although he said this usually occurs in the elderly. He sent us home after wrapping my son's foot and leg in a bandage for compression along with a referral to a peripheral vein doctor. A couple of days later, my son noticed that his foot and leg were no longer swollen but we still went to see the new doctor. By this time, the ultrasound of his leg veins didn't show any blood clots so the doctor didn't recommend any medication. He explained to us that chemo drugs thicken the blood thereby making those on chemo prone to blood clots. He recommended the use of compression stockings on both legs daily for as long as my son's on chemo, to be taken off at night but to keep legs elevated. He also strongly suggested to stay hydrated- drink lots of fluids, as another preventive measure. My son hasn't had a recurrence and he's been fine. Aside from wearing stockings and drinking lots, I remind him to stretch his legs, stand up and walk around after a couple of hours sitting in front of the computer to keep his circulation going. Although DVT isn't a serious condition, it may be dangerous if a clot breaks off and goes to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. You may want to watch out for difficulty breathing or pain in the chest area, go straight to the hospital if you encounter these symptoms. I've read that doctors may recommend heparin to thin out the blood, your doctors would know what best to do in your case. Hope this helps. I'm sure your arm will be back to normal in no time. Take care, Rachel",
