      "Content": "I had a PICC line for the 5 months that I had chemo and I was really glad I did. No needles for blood tests, scans or chemo. You get used to it really quickly and don't reaaly notice its there. It was only the last month I found the dressing really itchy. Weekly flush and dressing change didn't take long. I would recommend it but its all personal preference.  Claire x",

      "Content": "Hi Ann Im not a big runner but I am into my fitness working with a trainer every week and taking classes. I managed to continue with 3 sessions a week during my chemo but as my sessions went on I definately felt more tired and couldn't do what I could do before so we had to adapt our sessions.  I opted for running on the treadmill instead of outside as I was worried that I would get tired and not be able to make it back. For me, doing something was better than doing nothing and kept me mentally strong. Finished chemo about 4 weeks ago now and I am starting to get my fitness back which is exciting. Just listen to your body and see how you feel x",
