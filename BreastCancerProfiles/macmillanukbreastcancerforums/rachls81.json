    "Content": "Thank you so much for your post Lorna! I've logged on and off the site but havent wanted to face some of the content. I was diagnosed in June this year aged 29 and have kjust had my 30th birthday....never thought I'd be celebrating it bald, over weight and with only one boob!! I have been craving some contact with younger sufferers as have been tryong to stay so strong for friends and family but have finally borken down! lol. I have such a fab network and a very supportive boyf, he truly deserves a meddle, and after all I've been through I know I should be grateful but just feel like its all caught up with me. Remaining positive, always having an appointment to go to, a schedule of visitors to greet and now all thats pretty much over I feel exhausted! I know I'll pick myself back up as there are people worse off than me but sometimes feel angry at the world that it happened to me so young. How are you? what stage are you at? i live on the central line, do you know of any support groups etc in london? Would be great to hear from you, thanks again, Rachxx",
