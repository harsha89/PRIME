    "Content": "Hi.i am really sorry to hear about your friend.i am 34 and have breast cancer and know it is hard to deal with at any age.i know you want to get something special for your friend but believe me doing what you are doing is the most special thing a friend can do for her friend.when i was on my chemo my sister used to come 75 miles after her work to help me around the house with my children.my sister just being here helped me get through the tough days.i f eel that i could never repay her for her support and friendship she gave me .for me that support and just her being here and even knowing that she was just on the end of the phone for a chat is the best gift i could have ever been given.you sound like an amazing friend and your friend will appreciate everything you do even if you think its not much it will mean the world to her and it will be very special to her. you both will be in my thoughts. chelle.xxxxx",
