My oncologist switched me to 6mg of levomepromazine which has worked amazingly, made my 3&4th EC far more bearable. Will make you sleep though xx",

I know this is an anti depressant, but I am not depresssed. Has anyone also taken Fluoxetine for flushes? How did it effect you? Did it stop the flushes? Any mood change? I'm trying to weigh up the pros and cons before I start.  Thanks! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sal44! Im in the same boat, I'm 30 and haven't had a family yet. I also did fertility presavation before chemo, we managed to freeze 2 embryos, but the sats of achieving a successful pregnancy from 2 still worries me. I was told by the fertility doctor to go back 9 months after chemo and they will run some tests and examinations to reassess my fertility. Perhaps you could do that so you know where you stand?  I will also start on tamoxifen in a few weeks, I was told by my oncologist to wait 5 years, but the fertility dr said I could take a break after a couple of years. Not sure where I stand so I will have to investigate further later in the year. I think that after 5 years your chances of recurrence reduces significantly. I know what you mean about feeling selfish for potentially having children when my future is uncertain, it's a tough one. I guess we can't live on 'what ifs', I intend to get back to normal life after my treatment and children were always in our plan, so I'm sure we will try.  What will be will be, even if I don't manage to have a family of my own I know that as long as I'm alive I will have a wonderful fulfilled life   I'm friends with a few gay couples in their 30s and 40s who don't have kids and their lives are no worse off without them. In fact their livestyles are in some ways more appealing than my other friends with children ha!  I'd be interested to know how you get on, all the best of luck xxx",

      "Content": "Yes! It's awful isn't it!!! So sore and dry, I've tried all sorts..Vaseline, savlon, moisturiser, even  lip balm!! Savlon helped a bit, still sore though. Everyone at work must think I'm a right scruff with my fingers constantly up my nose. I'm trying hard not to pick. I think it's a docetaxol thing, as if was fine on EC. My final cycle is on Friday so I'm looking forward to my nose healing from then on  x",
