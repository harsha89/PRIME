    "Content": "I have had two grade 2 lumps successfully removed and all nodes of which  2 out of 35 nodes were affected and i am pos for oestrogen and prog.  After 3 really difficult Fec treatments even after they reduced the dose. I am now planning to stop chemo and not have the 3 docetaxol chemo, but go onto radiotherapy and anastrosol. My gut feeling is that its the right thing for me to do and I cannot face any further chemo, but coming under understandable pressure from freinds and family who feel i should do what the onco says and go ahead even though I cannot face it. I know this is their fear, but it has left me in pieces emotionally, with the onco appt tomororow to make the decision. Anyone else stopped after 3?",
