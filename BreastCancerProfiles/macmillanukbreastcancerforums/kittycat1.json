    "Content": "Hi Gail I appreciate your post was from a few years ago but I'm due to have the same surgery at St Thomas's in a few months and I wondered if you were happy with the results - both to your boobs and your bottom? I am 10 years since diagnosis and have had several reconstructions using implants but have never been happy with one side (which is the side that had radiotherapy). I am biting the bullet and going for the sGAP option to get rid of these bloody implants!Â  I hope all is well with you and any advice you have would be welcomed x",
