    "Content": "Hi. I was diagnosed with breast cancer last month and had a lumpectomy two weeks ago. My follow up appointment was today and I have been told that my lymph nodes are clear (only a couple of cancer cells were found in the sentinal nodes) but my tumour was bigger than expected, 3.5cm rather than the 2cm they initially thought from the ultrasounds. Because of the size, and my age (I'm 39) I'm facing six months of chemo followed by radiation therapy, and the option of a mastectomy has been given. I'm really unsure about the mastectomy, my surgeon said she had to tell me it was an option as there is a risk of a tumour returning, but I have no idea what percentage chance that would be. Should I go through another operation and lose my breast when I don't know what the chances are of a tumour returning? Other things I have to consider are where I will have my treatment, as I'm a New Zealander who has been living in the UK for nine years and my family back in NZ are pretty desperate for me to go back for treatment (it was a bit of a drama before my operation explaining that I didn't think it was practical for anyone to come all this way to be with me for the op! As it happens I have some brilliant friends here who looked after me and the surgery went better thank I was expecting thankfully). I'm actually keen to go back as well, especially as we're heading into winter, plus I definitely think I will need my family to support me through this. But six months is a long time and I will have to do things like putting all my belongings in storage, because I flatshare, and deal with my work. It's all a bit daunting to think about right now. Then there's egg harvesting to consider. I'm single and childless but definitely want to have children if I can, but by the time the chemo/radiation and hormone therapy (I'm ER+/HER2-) are done I'll be knocking on the door of 45 so will it be worth the bother? Of everything I'm going through I think this is upsetting me the most because I want to be a mum so much and I already get very upset at the thought of it never happening (all my own stupid fault of course!) I had thought I was dealing with things ok up until this morning but my appointment has shaken me up and I've been a bit of an emotional mess all afternoon (and watching Eastenders just now set me off again!) I'm trying so hard to be positive, and I have a great ability to look at things logically and keep things in perspective, but I just feel so wretched today.",
