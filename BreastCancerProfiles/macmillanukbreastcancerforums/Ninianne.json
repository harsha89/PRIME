      "Content": "Waiting for results is so hard isn't it? I read somewhere that humans aren't good at coping with uncertainty. We are reassured by certainties.  Makes sense to me. I am fine physically now, thanks. I'm now a year and 2 months on from treatment. Still feel more tired than I used to but maybe I just need to get more exercise and build up my stamina! :) I recall being concerned about the bone aches, but my worries were all groundless, thankfully.  I think the first dose of Taxotere (on 4th round of chemo) was the lowest point, after that they lowered the dose and the rest of the chemo was bearable. The fatigue was pretty bad for a while, but it passed.  Just don't push yourself, rest as much as you can, and never say \"No\" to an offer of help! :) Take care, Nin x",

      "Content": "Exactly the same happened to me. A year on it's a distant memory, in fact I'd even forgotten about that aching symptom, and most of the others too.  It all passes, but I did lots of sounding off at the time, it helps no end.  You will come thru. Hang in there.  Ninianne",
