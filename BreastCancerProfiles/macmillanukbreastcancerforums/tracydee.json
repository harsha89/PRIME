The op went will was only in for 2 day drain removed after one day but when a got home a felt really unwell it took about 2 weeks before they found out i had mrsa so i was back in hospital for 10 days but its just one of these things that can happen.I did not start chemo till dec it did hold things up a bit i have had 6 chemo and now on tamoxifen for 5 years and have 30 rads to get but doing good the only thing that worrys me they can not tell me if there has been spread to the lymth nodes under the coller bone it does not show up on any of the scans they have done so they are going to give me boost rads there it just seems strange that you have to live with not knowing but am just so happy a found it and could get treatment . How are you feeling with the chemo xxxx",
