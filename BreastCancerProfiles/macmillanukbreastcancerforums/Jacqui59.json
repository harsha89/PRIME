    "Content": "Hi  I had mastectomy for lobular cancer with all lymph nodes affected followed by chemo and Radiotherapy. Which finished in Feb this year. I\u2019m now taking Inbandronic acid for the next 3 years and Anastrozole for 10 years. I\u2019ve been experiencing back pain in two areas of my spine. My oncologist arranged a bone decity scan for me and a bone scan for next Friday. I\u2019m so scared they the cancer may have spread to my bones as I was told I was at high risk. Each time I feel the pain it reminds me. I will get the results on the 4th July. My life feels on hold till then. I know my back problem could be caused by my medication. ",
