    "Content": "Hi Samzie, I\u2019m also 30 and was diagnosed almost a month ago with grade 3 ER, PR and Her-2 + breast cancer. I had my first FEC last Monday. I know it\u2019s hard to stay positive but from what I have read we are getting the best treatment out there and there are lots of people that have been through this and are healthy and happy now. I was put in touch with a lady in my area who went through the same 10 years ago when she was 28, she has been a great help. My local Macmillan nurse also told me about a 64 year old lady who had been in for her routine screen recently (she had this when she was 24). People do get through this, we just have to try to remember that when times are tough. I hope you haven\u2019t suffered too much with side effects. Take care, Nicola xx",
