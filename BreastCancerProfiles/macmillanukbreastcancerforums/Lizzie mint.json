    "Content": "Hi Booth1986. I'm in for my pre-op today. Working hard not to be too anxious and worried. I know exactly where you're coming from. Thanks for sharing - it's a good reminder that what I'm feeling is normal. Take care of yourself - and allow others to take care of you too. I hope your treatment goes well. Much love, Lizze-Mint xxÂ ",
