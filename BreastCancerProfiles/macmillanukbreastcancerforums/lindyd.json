I feel if it was IBC then pain would be persistent - any comments or views would be appreciated Every morning I wake up my first thought is my boob - getting obsessed LOL if GP had not found a lump would now be cancelling appointment - just back playing waiting game Thanks again and take care x",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your support - I GOT THE ALL CLEAR - can not believe my luck - relived doesn't even begin to describe how I feel. Mammogram, ultra sound scan and examination all clear - the doctor I saw said the only explanation was it was down to hormones -( sorry I didn't get straight back on to let you know but had a very upset tum - nerves or a bug don't know which but its clearing now.) I couldn't believe how quick it all was - appointment 2.20 leaving hospital with results at 3.30 - it does however make me wonder how we are treated as women - if it was possible for me to have three different examinations and get results in an hour why are they making lots of women wait sometimes weeks for results? Anyway thanks again for all your support and good luck to you all where ever you are on your journey take care love Linda x",

      "Content": "Hello everyone - I went to docs with painful breast and after examination doc said could feel lump - referred to breast clinic - got appointment through not until 13th MAY - seems like a life time away - not sleeping, constantly worried over the what ifs - went back to docs as breast had swollen but as is sods law it went down and was almost back to normal by the time I saw her - sure doc thinks I'm paranoid- examined again and doc said nothing had changed (I read into this lump still there and same size) - I'm worried that pain and swelling could point to inflammatory breast cancer but when mentioned GP said she not heard of anything using those terms - feel Iv been fobbed off - I didn't argue my case just sat there like an idiot only got angry later and took it out on my poor husband. Doc did however say that she would write and try to get appointment brought forward BUT could not promise anything. So I'm left playing the waiting game (hubby is only one who knows there might be a problem and strain is starting to show - don't know how much longer I can hold out saying yes I'm ok when people ask - but until I know what we are dealing with I'm trying not to worry anyone if that makes sense) What is the two week rule and how does it work - is there anyway I can be seen earlier - sorry for prattling on but so confused",
