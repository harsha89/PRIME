    "Content": "Hi  Like you I have started chemo followed to be followed by lumpectomy &a radiotherapy. Due my second chemo of EC Thursday. Since diagnosis have been working. I was off a few days after the first chemo just to rest etc & after the weekend them worked from home for most of the first week & i then went back into the office. Don't want to let this take over but making sure I pace myself also. It has helped to have normality & routine. Day 14 hair coming out with a vengeance -have a wig which I wore into work with success. Thinking about getting the rest shaved as have a lot of bald patches and scalp feels very tender which I am told will settle once hair gone. Have to say it is all still very surreal and still can't quite believe it's happening.  Hope you are doing ok ",
