    "Content": "I am so sorry to read that you have been diagnosed at such a young age before you have even had a chance to have babies yet. Have you talked to your oncologist or anyone at Macmillan about the possibilities of conceiving after cancer treatment? They may be able to give you up-to-date info about these things. Hang on in there; focus on beating the cancer now and try to remain hopeful about what the future might bring. Good luck. p.s. my partner has just reminded me about a colleague of his who, like you, was diagnosed at a young age who has not only overcome the cancer, but then went on to have a pregnancy (and healthy baby daughter) using a donated egg and her partner's sperm. There is definitely hope. Try and keep positive.x",
