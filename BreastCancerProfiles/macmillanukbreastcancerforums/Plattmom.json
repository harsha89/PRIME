      "Content": "Hi Ann, yes to everything that Shey said. My planning appointment actually took 3 hours when the letter said plan for 1 hour. It was because I saw the oncologist, then more waiting, then the radiologist, then more waiting, then the CT scan with planning. I would add that there is also a lot of writing on your breast with marking pens and taping wires on your breast too. That was the most invasive part.  blessings Kim",

My plan is to drink 2 litres of water a day and use lots of moisturiser. And have my bag with crochet, book, and notebook in case there is a wait. Any other prep ideas greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Good morning, well it's afternoon now. I've had a really hard time getting moving this morning. 3/22 this afternoon at 4:45.  I used pit rock for years, then I used something from LUSH for a long time but then went back to some sort of natural roll on. But honestly since chemo I hardly sweat at all, so haven't used anything . . . and my skin is so dry and flakey when I shower that I keep that to a minimum too. My hair is about an inch long now, might start to need more washing soon.  A bell? I've seen that on the American facebook groups that I'm on. But I didn't know anyone had a bell to ring here in the UK. I'm going to try and remember to ask about that today.  I was pretty much in a good routine of putting on moisturiser morning and evening after my surgeries. But now to add doing it a 3rd time in the middle of the day is hard. Saturday morning after just 2 treatments my skin seemed to peel when I put on the cream, really after only two days? I had a good talk with my friend who was a skin cream research scientist about what type of moisturiser to use. I've also been collecting a list of what women say they use. It's a long list!!! I'll let you know if I come up with anything interesting. My friend did say the stuff with oats in it was good---Aveeno. He also said to avoid anything with fragrance or perfume. Let me tell you after a research trip to Superdrug and Boots almost everything has fragrence and perfume.  Now to try and write some Christmas cards. Kim",
