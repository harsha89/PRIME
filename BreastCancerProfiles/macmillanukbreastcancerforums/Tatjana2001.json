My mum has finished her treatments yesterday and since then I am so emotional and lost.She was diagnosted with grade 3once  stage 3 invasive breast cancer plus triple negative. her onc said that she has significant risk of reoccurrence .  I am feeling so emotional as from now only mammogram once a year, and waiting...no tests,no scans,jut listen to your body. i am feeling so helpless and useless . thinking what if she was having a private insurance the thinks will be different? Although I know that triple negative is treating by chemo and it's the only medicine for that.Sorry for moaning but feeling so uncertain. have a great day everyone! xxxx",
