      "Content": "A few months ago I found a lump on my right breast, went to the doctors thinking oh it will be nothing but she found it right away without me telling her where it was.  Was told to go for a mammogram and ultrasound which i did.  Results showed the following:-   Several rounded densities visible in both breasts but no architectural distortion or suspicious microcalcification is seen.  Ultrasound reveals numerous typical and atypical cysts on each side.  On the right the largest cyst lies at 9 oclock and measures 14 x 7mm, on the left the largest cyst is 9mm and lies close to the nipple at 5 oclock.  Ultrasound reveals no predominantly solid mass or architectural distortion.  In cases such as this, any palpable lesion must be taken in conjunction with the imaging findings and further investigation not delayed if clinically suspicious. When i asked the doctor what this meant in simple terms she didnt know what atypical was!!!  She told me i have nothing to worry about and that i should put it to the back of my mind and just attend regularly yearly mammograms. The problem is my sister died at age 41 of ovarian cancer with a very late diagnosis (which i know is normal as this type of cancer is hard to detect until it is in late stages), my aunty had a breast removed due to breast cancer in her early 50's and i have just found out my dads mother died of breast cancer. Am i worrying to much that the doctor could be wrong or should i go get a second opinion???? The lump i felt months ago is stil there although sometimes i think it feels as if it has gone and the doctor did say that at my age (40) it is common to have lots of cysts,   Any advice would be appreciated.   thanks   Fiona",

      "Content": "Hi Ellen, Went to docs today for a second opinion and have been referred to breast surgeon for further investigation, the doc says that anything on a breast ultrasound that shows anything other than normal should be checked further and with having such a strong family history extra care has to be taken.  So got an appointment with the breast surgeon on March 7th, the woman i spoke to today said that the breast surgeon will ask for copies of my mammogram and ultrasound and report if he feels there is something there that needs urgent attention he will ask me to come in asap.  Feel a lot better now.   Fiona xx",
