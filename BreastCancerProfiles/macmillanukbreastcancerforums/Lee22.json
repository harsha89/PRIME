    "Content": "Sorry to hear this. I had this diagnosis and had a lumpectomy in November 2017. I was oestrogen positive, progesterone negative, lymph node negative. I had an oncotype DX test which is a test of 4 or 5 of the genes in the tumour and based on the analysis of the results gives you a score for the likelihood of cancer recurring if treated only with radiotherapy and tamoxifen (hormone treatment drug) . I came back high risk for recurrence so chemotherapy was recommended and will.make likelihood of recurrence less likely. You should be offered an oncotype DX test at your post op oncology appointment. Good luck with it all",
