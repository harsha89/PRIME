    "Content": "From what I understand excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of breast cancer. Therefore, I don't agree that this news article suggests that you have to drink to excess or be overweight to get breast cancer, which seems to suggest that no-one would get it if they were teetotal and not overweight. I interpreted it as meaning that out of those that do get breast cancer there is a percentage that would not have if they hadn't consumed alcohol to excess.",
