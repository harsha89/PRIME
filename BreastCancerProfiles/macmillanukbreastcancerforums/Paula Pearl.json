      "Content": "Hi I am coming up to what should be a happy time I had breast cancer five years ago and have done really well in that time. My worry is I had my last scan and mammogram yesterday, I have been discharged from the Oncologist and next week will stop taking my medication.  All this is fantastic I know but I am so scared I feel as if all my safety nets are being taken away all together. Has any one else felt like this?  Any comments are tips would be appreciated. Thank you Paula x  ",
