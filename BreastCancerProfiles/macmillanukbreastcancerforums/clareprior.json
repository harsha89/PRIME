    "Content": "Dear All, I hate to say this but I finished chemo over 4 years ago and my hair has never grown back properly despite all the assurances Â you get beforehand. It's still like something from the back of the tumble drier despite 6 months with a trichologist and every sort of product, dietary supplements, homeopathy, change of drugs, a lovely supportive hairdresser, etc.etc. I wear hats a lot and resort to my wig for special occasions. I've considered surgery but the thought is horrendous. It's by far the most difficult aspect of the whole cancer business for me, and I've never found anyone else in the same boat. Everyone is really polite about it but when I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, or worse, see a photo, I look like an old man.... (I'm 64 and always had thick, fair hair!). Anyone else heard of such a thing?!?",
