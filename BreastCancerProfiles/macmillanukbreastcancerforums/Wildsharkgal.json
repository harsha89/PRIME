      "Content": "Crystaljuju Hi Wildsharkgal  Lobular is generally a slower growing cancer normally at grade 2. That's why it's better. However with regard to treatment the hormonal status/where the cancer has reached is more the factors in determining whether you have chemo. For example I had triple negative bc which had reached one lymph node. That means I got chemo not the fact it was lobular.   At a guess your BC may have been oestrogen positive and hadn't reached any lymph nodes and relatively small tumour? Oestrogen positive diagnosis don't always get chemo. But you do get to take hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen after? love Julia xx",
