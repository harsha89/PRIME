    "Content": "hi every one who has already replied and also scoobs, im 39 and was diagnosed in November last year,  i had my right breast removed and the glands also,i have my 8th and final chemo tomorrow, thank god, then on the 14th june i start my 15 sessions of Radiotherapy, the chemo has got better each time , not too much sickness, just the usual sore mouth, nose, bitter taste in the mouth, i was poorly with my last chemo i caught a chest and urine infection, but im fine now, I have noticed this time my taste buds have gone on strike, i lost all taste and smell, i have a little bit back now but not fully, my periods  also stopped  in January and i now suffer with HOT SWEATS, does anyone else suffer with these,ive been told im on the early change but they may come back after treatment, hope everyone is having a good day, and are keeping positive and try and be motivated, some days i just want to sit in my pjs and cry, then i tell myself to stop being silly as it is not forever and i will  look back at it in time as a bad but positive thing that happened and have got over and through it, WE ARE ALL FIGHTERS!!!",
