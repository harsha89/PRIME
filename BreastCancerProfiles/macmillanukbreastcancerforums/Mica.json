      "Content": "Thank you so much for your advice. It's really helped me, I've got crazy anxiety as it is so I'm constantly worrying about her ( not to her face though, I'm trying to be strong)  She said she has to have it every three weeks, do you feel poorly all the time or do you get some good days? I have a chronic illness so I know how feeling poorly all the time can affect your mental health and I can't bare the thought of her having to endure that too.  Are you still doing chemo? I hope things are looking up for you, you sound like a strong lady. Thank you so much for sharing your story, Mica x",
