      "Content": "Hello all.  I just wondered if anyone had any advice to offer.  My mother has 'recently' had a mastectomy and has just had her penultimate dose of chemo.  She's had really bad diahorrea after this one (worse than before) and has felt so bad she's not eating much, not drinking much and is now unsteady on her feet (she's 80 this year).  She's just been given something to help but does anyone know if you are able to take dioralyte or something like that to help replenish what's lost?  Anyone any suggestions to tempt the taste buds?",
