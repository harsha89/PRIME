    "Content": "Chloecat45: I have been reading this book, Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, and just about finished (have had it for three days only).  Make sure you get the 5th edition published in 2010.  She covers every thing and I mean everything about breast cancer.  It shows you how to read your reports and interpret them for you.  I downloaded to my kindle app. online and my kindle. The reason I tell you this, is because it really has told me every option out there for every type of breast cancer and every grade and stage and stats associated with treatments. You have to do the research.  I'm still scared silly and frantic, but the knowledge has calmed me a bit so when I make a decision, I know I\"ll have checked into every avenue.",
