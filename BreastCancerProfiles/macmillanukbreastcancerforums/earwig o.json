I have kept it up and have it most morning as it doesn't make you go lots and I feel it is a healthy adjustment to my diet. Angela x",

Had to wear a camisole under it as its quite see through and off I went feeling like the dogs back wheels!! Half way through the meal I suddenly realised that I was probably not going to be able to get said top off as arm still hasn't got full movement back so decided to ask one of my friends to walk back to my car and help me get it off...I would be fine driving home in a camisole cos it was still 29 degrees out there. When we got to my car which was parked in a quiet back street I decided to try myself to get it off because I thought it would be good exercise and indeed I managed it....but then I looked around and realised I was being observed by 3 people watering their gardens, a pizza delivery man and a taxi driver depositing four people into the restaurant that I had just come from....now where did they all come from!! Lots of smile, some a bit sheepish and all with a story to tell when they get home.  I really shouldn't be allowed out!!",

The only things I have noticed are a slight sinus tension and muzzy head which is no problem at all really since i'm not going anywhere or trying to do anything much while I have eager helpers. Last night tongue felt a bit sore and wondered of I would have sore mouth this morning but no just did too much talking yesterday I think...will be eating no more cherries as they did taste very sour yesterday and everyone assured me that they weren't.  Good luck for 19th you will be one step nearer beating this critter.

Next day again completely flat on my back. It wasn't unpleasant and I certainly wouldn't have wanted sickness instead but just goes to show that you must tell them what it was like for you and they can almost always make it better.  When do you start yours?",

They were very kinds and extremely apologetic but leaves me with a second round of chemo to have on Thursday through a cannula, which was difficult last time. I am more than a little disappointed and am sporting a very sore arm not to mention aching elbow and shoulder from holding the awkward position for so long. Appointment is being made for a Port to be fitted before round 3. More than a little hacked off. ",

Onco now suggesting I just take one the day after chemo and see how it goes. If I start to feel sick I can take another....this will still be halving what I took last time. He seems to think just one the day after chemo will do and I hope he's right because both the constipation and the exhaustion was not nice. He also suggested a spoonful of milled flax seed mixed in with breakfast cereal two days before chemo which I shall try. He's very keen not to push more drugs into bodies already over loaded with drugs and this is fine by me.",

There is a lot of stiffness but exercises are slowly moving that forward and I will be glad to get rid of the drain tomorrow. It's ok to feel weepy, every new step is a leap into the unknown, but you will be fine. As for preparation I really don't know, I stumbled straight into it and have come out fighting so just go for it. I'm sure there will be others on here who will add their experiences and I wish you all the best. Angela x    ",
