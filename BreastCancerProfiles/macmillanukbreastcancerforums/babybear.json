    "Content": "I also agree with Lyndy its amazing how many of my husbands \"friends\" have had a cold or flu for the past 3 months and cant visit, they don't even have the cheek to be embarrassed about it. Every time I meet them they ask how he is and before I can get a chance to answer I get told I would go and visit \"but\". In my humble opinion he is better off without them but it is pretty upsetting when he asks why they have never been. On the other hand he got a phone call from an old friend that he had not seen in years who had only just found out and he was delghted to hear from him.",
