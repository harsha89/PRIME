      "Content": "I'm also 54 and had previously had endometrial resection (womb lining removed) so no periods and had also had Mirena coil fitted to help balance endometriosis so no one knew for sure if I had reached menopause. My cancer is also oestrogen receptor positive. My oncologist is not taking any chances and it seems I'm likely to be on Tamoxifen for a further 4 years. At first she had said I MIGHT need to take it for two years and then go on to Arimidex but at last appointment she said she wouldn't chance it and wants me to take Tamoxifen for the full five years. I also had to come off black cohosh and sage which I had been taking for hot flushes before BC - they affect oestrogen apparently. The hot flushes are horrible as are all the other side effects of Tamoxifen but the alternative is too awful to contemplate so guess I'm stuck with it. Even though I'd been having hot flushes for about 6 months before my diagnosis my oncologist didn't think this was conclusive proof of the menopause. I trust her every word so am sticking with what she says. You could always ask for a second opinion if you have doubts. Take care x",

      "Content": "I think we're all numb when we get the diagnosis. You're not alone in that. I was so much in denial that when I was given the diagnosis and told I would be having a lumpectomy in just over a week's time I dragged my diary out and start telling them I was too busy at work and that just wan't possible. The doctor and breast cancer nurse must have thought I was crazy. It embarrasses me to think of it now. I had my six monthly check up on Monday and as at the previous check up in May I was completely wound up. I just seemed to get on with it when I was having chemo and radiotherapy but I just go to pieces at these six monthly check ups. I think you let it go away for a while and then when you're back at the hospital it all comes flooding back and the fear takes over. I told the doctor this and she said there is a lot of research as to whether or not it is pyschologically damaging to have people back for check ups. Apparently they don't often pick things up at routine checkups - most problems are reported by the patients themselves to their GP or bycontacting the hospital. I think we just want things to be normal again and not be reminded of what we went through having operations/chemo/radio etc. The treatment does eventually pass and I agree with the others about the sickness - make sure you take the tablets and don't think like I did after one session \"oh I was ok last time I won't take them for as long as I'm supposed to\" - it makes you miserable feeling so sickly- there's no need to. I also found the \"sea bands\" for sea sickness were helpful. My hospital gave me loads of literature about the drugs and treatment and I always felt they were so approachable and happy to repeat things if I wasn't sure. Good luck to you. My chemo finished the week before Christmas last year - and here we are another Christmas coming up. You'll get through it too x",

      "Content": "Oh yes I remember it well!!!! I was told the success rate was 1 in 4 keep their hair - numbers become very important when you have cancer and you have to weigh them up - this is so many per cent successfull, the other is so many other per cent successful. I gave it a go and I did not lose my hair although it became very thin. Yes it is agonising, like sitting with a freezer pack of peas on your head but it does wear off and I used to like to wrap myself in a blanket and have a nice cup of tea. It does make everything take a lot longer because you have it on for about 45 minutes before, then it's changed and you have your chemo and then another half hour or so. My daughter and husband who came with me the first time said I looked like a human cannon ball with it on so I suppose it was worth it to make them laugh !!!!!! I used to try and imagine sitting somewhere hot like a tropical beach and pretend it wasn't hurting like mad. Make sure you get them to put some cotton wool around the forehead I found that took the brutal cold sting off. With regard to hair I had mine cut really short (nice people said I looked like Kylie). I did very little to it - no straighteners, no hair dryers and lots of conditioners. Yes it went very thin but I could live with that and my chemo was through the summer so no cold head. It has grown back thicker than ever and is in fab condition. Other body hair came out to - just think no armpit hair for months - you'll save a fortune on hair removal creams - ha ha!! Good luck to you and remember it doens't last for ever although it seems to at the time. I had my last chemo last December then a month of radiotherapy . So hard to believe that it's nearly a year since my last chemo - there is a light at the end of the tunnel, however faint it is now xx",

      "Content": "My chemo (for BC) finished just before Xmas 2007 and my radiotherapy started first week in January. I only had 3 weeks as my doctor said they found it to be just as effective (for BC) as having 4 weeks. Have to say that by the end of the sessions my skin was starting to suffer. Aloe vera was very cooling and you'll get loads of info about not using soap etc. I was off work and don't know how I would have managed if I'd had to work. It took up most of the morning - travelling to hospital (40 mile round trip), parking and waiting although the sessions itself lasted minutes. It's a walk in the park compared to chemo. Many congrats on having travelled so far on your journey - good luck x",

      "Content": "Get a chillow - they are great. I'm onto my second,the cat put an end to the first one when he clawed it!!!! I also have a lightweight duvet, windows open etc. I'm also in and out of the covers all night but just grab the chillow out from under by pillow, give it a hug or put it behind my neck and it helps. My poor hubbie who is follicly challenged has to sleep with a hat on and shivers most of the night whilst I \"glow\". If you need to take Tamoxifen - it's one of the side effects too. (Sorry!!) They say alcohol makes the flushes worse and coffee - not sure - will have to keep experimenting with that nice glass of red wine of an evening. Take care x",
