      "Content": "Having a moment.!!!! Finished radiotherapy on Feb 3rd for my left breast. Some time in January I noticed by right breast was starting to invert slightly next to nipple. Ignored it thinking i was being paranoid. Spoke to my husband who said it felt firmer than usual. Kept an eye on it it kept doing strange things. Phoned BCN and she spoke to consultant. Saw consultant last Friday 17th who saw what i meant, mammogram and ultrasound showed nothing. But as i had ilc and idc in left breast sending me for MRI. Saw images of mammogram aerola folded in half didn't do that at last mammogram. I don't want to do this again.",

      "Content": "Hi Jane,  Just to try and reassure you, I had cancer in my first lymph node and then have gone on to have a full node clearance. The rest of the nodes are clear which is good. Even though it had started to spread I still do not have to have chemo, I am in a percentage group where i could have chemo or not the choice is mine. improvement percentage to me didn't seem worth the treatment so have stuck with radiotherapy followed by tamoxifen. Try not to worry",
