      "Content": "Hi Vickster.. I totally agree with everything everyone has said on here. You are covered by the Disability act and there is no right or wrong time to return to work but like you I have just finished rads and I am slowly getting more soreness, pain and tiredness. Loss of sleep due to pain. I also have a HR meeting next week and a sick note till 12th October but I am not due to see Oncologist again till mid or late October so I know for a fact my GP will not send me back before at least that time...work up to now have been OK but you do feel under pressure when having to attend these bloody meetings.  Anyway chin up love and you will feel better for joining this community. I certainly do and Denzilpants, you made me laugh too!, Take care love and keep chatting...it helps. Angela x",

      "Content": "Hi Sam I have just finished my treatment of WLE and radiotherapy x 15. It is such a frightening and anxious time but I agree with others on here that the professionals will take over and you will start to accept and the only desire you will then have is to kick this thing outta the window and come out of it a stronger and more determined person than ever. I was also like you and even now I can find the nights the time when my mind starts overworking and dark clouds appear but then I remember that I finally reached the end of this roller coaster ride and wonder how quickly that time could pass...but it does Sam. We are all here for you and I have been touched and encouraged by everyone in here. You have just joined a different party in your life, that is all, and this unique journey called cancer opens your eyes in ways you never thought they could be opened.    You will have lots of laughs along the way....stay positive and accept all the emotion that comes your way...feel no guilt and remember...YOU ARE NOT ALONE....   One step at a time.... love Angie x  ",
