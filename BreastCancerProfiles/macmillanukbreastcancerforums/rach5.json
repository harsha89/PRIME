    "Content": "Hi ponymad, it is overwhelming but also sureal, i was diagnosed in April after the doctors took a small biopsy (they thought it was just a lump so went to get results on my own silly me), I then had an MRI scan to check nodes and finally had a WLE with sentinal nodes removed, had to have a further op for a bit more clearance a week or so later but after 1 week of being helpless and sore I was fine. BCN are really good and helpful, with my experience I have never had to ask any questions they have told me all I needed to know. Do use them, they are a great support. Best wishes xxx",
