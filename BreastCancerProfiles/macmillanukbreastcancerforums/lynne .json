The whole side of my breast is now bruised and the cut is purple, I know it obviously varies for different people but I was just wondering if this is normal and if there is any other effects I should expect to happen in the next few days?  Lynne xx",

I got told I may need a second operation but I don't find out for definite until my results in 3 weeks. Good luck for tomorrow, hope everything goes well. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Helen and tinkers,  Thank you both so much for your quick response, it was a big shock to see a lot of my hair falling out and I wasn't expecting it so soon with using the cold cap. It has put my mind at ease to know that you both have been through the same experience.  I have bought a lot of bandana's recently and still looking to buy more because I was aware my hair may fall out, obviously the cold cap hasn't worked for me. I don;t think I'd be able to cope with a wig as I've heard it's very irritating and makes you itch.  Lynne xx",

      "Content": "Hiya,  I had my first cycle of  FEC chemotherapy on 26th January using the cold cap. I know it is normal for your hair to fall out because of chemo but it's only my first cycle and wondered if it was normal for my hair to fall out so quickly? Over the past 2 days my hair is just falling out in clumps, I just washed it and the bath is full of hair it even blocked the plug. I've also been getting burning sensations at the back of my head - could this be due to the hair loss? I'm a bit worried about it. Lynne xx ",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your advice and website links.  This is my first time on the computer since my last chemo, I had the second cycle of FEC on 16 Feb but I didn't use the cold cap as my hair was falling out anyway and the hair on my head was irritating me and in the end got the shaver out and shaved it all off, my husband did it on a number 3 cut.  I haven't got much hair left now so I have got the bandanas out and when I feel well enough will be taking a trip to town for a wig to try it out, if it ends up irritating me I'll just have to stick to the bandanas.
