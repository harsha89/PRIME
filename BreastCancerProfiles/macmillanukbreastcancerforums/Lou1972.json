    "Content": "Hi Emaline i just caught this post because of the cold feet heading, I\u2019m a stomach cancer patient not breast but after reading your reply I just wanted to respond.  Dont feel you have to aspire to anything, as much as I love cold feet, I found the calmness around Jen\u2019s diagnosis unrealistic, for me I was a mess, I cried for days and struggled with the waiting as did my family, even Jens kids didn\u2019t seem that affected and it was all handled in a light hearted manner, especially her post op recovery and only a slight reference to chemo side affects.  A cancer diagnosis takes the wind out of your sails, you need your family and they will want to be there for you, there are no right or wrong levels of emotions, some days I can be strong and others I am not and a little thing can affect me so much. If you haven\u2019t already try and listen to the You Me and the Big C podcasts on bbc radio 5 live, I found the topics, the frankness, the hope and the normality of the conversations very helpful, There are many cancer warriors out there on Instagram that I get inspiration and motivation from.  Be kind to yourself, whilst I have a different diagnosis and treatment of you wish to offload onto someone I am here. I\u2019ve made a few friends along this journey with different illnesses And I\u2019ve found great comfort in sharing experiences.  Taks care louise",
