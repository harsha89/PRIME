    "Content": "Hi Pickles its so hard to be Merry at Christmas especially in your situation. i see friends on Facebook putting up photos of there decorations and say bah humbug just like Scrooge. even though you have little ones if you don\u2019t hav3 the energy to go all out ask for help. Get the kids involved. music helps ... some Christmas colours and make some homemade decorations with your littlies. And your partner if you have one. my kids and grandchildren are grown now and live at a distance so I generally cancel Christmas. However I then tend to last minute do a token effort. lastly my advise is to see your GP and get an antidepressant. I could not survive without my Prozac/ Lovan Keeps the dreaded anxiety at bay. build some memories every day for the rest of you life... however long it may be. ps. It sounds to me like you are finally allowing yourself to grieve for the the time lost and for what might come ....Â  find someone to hug you.",
