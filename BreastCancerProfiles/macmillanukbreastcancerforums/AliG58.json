Having the line out felt like a small step on the road back to normality, so I can just imagine how great you must be feeling. My next step is op (therapeutic mammoplasty ) on 10th April then 20 rads  ... counting down the days to getting these milestones ticked off. Much love to everyone, whatever stage you're at xx",

      "Content": "Hi All, I suffered with breathing problems during Chemotherapy at the beginning of this year, and was given steroids which helped a lot. I then had my op followed by radiotherapy, which finished in August. Since then I have had a couple of colds, and they always go straight to my chest. About three weeks ago I went to my GP with a persistent cold and cough, and he diagnosed bronchitis, gave me antibiotics, steroids and a ventolin inhaler - within three days I was so much better! When I went back 10 days later for a follow-up, he said he thought I had adult onset asthma, quite possibly brought on by radiotherapy, and told me to hold on to the inhaler. I've been coughing for three days now, but the inhaler is definitely helping! He did say he thinks it will eventually resolve itself too. xx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I finished chemo almost 7 weeks ago now and started suffering from neuropathy a week or so after the last one. My fingers feel numb almost all of the time. My oncologist said that it may improve over the next few months but unfortunately sometimes it can be permanent. It's really getting me down at the moment because I do a lot of cross stitching but am struggling to even feel the needle ... I have been knitting instead but even that feels strange. I hope yours clears up soon xx",

I have more than enough belly fat and just assumed that would be the way forward but was interested to read George's comment that they don't usually like to reconstruct over a C cup. I'm a GG so does this mean a big reduction on that side? Got my first year mammogram next Tuesday and I'm bricking it for some reason so maybe best see how that goes first? Xx",

Tax has been a real bi*** tho and there have been many days when I just wanted to stop the world!

In theory yes, but when you're struggling even to lift your head off the pillow but the diarrhoea has hit and you gotta run ...... well they really don't have a clue eh?! Like you, I  know it's making me better, one scan showed that it had shrunk by 1 cm. .. which does at least mean I can have the op that I want! Well, let's be honest, I don't want an op any more than I wanted any of this, but I guess it's a bit late now!!! Good luck to everyone, whatever stage of treatment you're at xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, well I hoped to be posting a much happier post than this! I had my operation follow - up with the surgeon this morning.  After 6 chemo it really looked like my lump had shrunk considerably and the surgeon really thought that the TM and radiotherapy would be an end to it. Unfortunately not to be. They discovered during the op that it is far more extensive than the scans showed but luckily all still contained in the same breast. It seems that chemo may have shattered it, which is apparently not uncommon - in fact I was warned about it before but like everything \"it wasn't gonna happen to me!\". So the only option now is mastectomy. My surgeon was as disappointed as me, he has done such a fantastic job and my 'new boob' is healing so well and looks amazing! I cried in his office ... The first time I have cried in front of anyone outside of the house since diagnosis! Made me feel better tho, and now I have told the family I can feel my strength returning. And if anyone asks why I didn't have mastectomy in the first place then they better be prepared for a smack in the mouth!! (Even if only a verbal one) xx",

He said that in my case it would be delayed reconstruction  ... but everything by that point had become white noise, so I really don't remember why. Have to go to hospital for herceptin on Friday so I'm gonna try to see my BCN while I'm there.
