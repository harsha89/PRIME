      "Content": "I was diagnosed last week and have to wait now for surgery later this month (three weeks time). I keep thinking my opposite breast now feels different. I had no obvious lump on the left hand side and the cancer was picked up through a routine family history mammogram and subsequent biopsies. My left side feels odd now, but I have had three biopsies over the last three months so it is pretty tender. Now I have an uncomfortable sensation on the right side. I don't know if I am imagining it and it is in my head now because I am worrying. Has anyone else felt a different sensation? Sorry if I am asking a stupid question, it is just bothering me now.",

      "Content": "Thank you for responding to me. Yes, I have had a call to say that I will be referred to genetics for testing. I also have two daughters who are the same age as yours - if you don't mind me asking, what have you told them and how did you tell them? My husband is also away a lot - in fact he works away Monday to Thursday. I have my own business with a fab business partner and that is giving me a positive focus while I wait for surgery.  I am just starting to tell my friends now that I have had a couple of days to let this all sink in. Are you still waiting for surgery or have you had it already? I hope all is going well for you so far. I think I am struggling with the fact that suddenly everything is uncertain, and out of my hands. And the waiting is so hard. It is strange how I can get through things without giving it a thought and then suddenly it hits me again. I am a believer in having a positive attitude and I hope as I gather my friends around me I will draw so much strength from them. Thank you x ",

      "Content": "I hope the second op went well and they got the clear margins. I don't really know what stage I am at I was told it is '2' but I don't really know what that means. It is now that I am digesting everything that I realise I have so many questions to ask - I think when I was sat in that room on Tuesday I just shut down - I heard words but I really didn't take much in. I am writing a list of questions to talk to my breast care nurse about. It feels like I have been going through this for ages as it started in June and then I had two unsuccessful biopsies and then had to have surgery for them to get to the cells so I am pretty battered and bruised already - physically and emotionally! I too believe in honesty and think that is best with the girls. It is just about picking the right moment and giving them the right messages so they are not too scared.  Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi After two unsuccessful biopsies and then surgery I received the news that I have breast cancer. I am still trying to let the news sink in. I am having surgery later this month to remove the cancer and then I will know more about my treatment plan. I am not sure how I am supposed to be feeling, I think I am still in shock really. I know I am scared and I want to draw from others strength and courage to help me to get through this and to know what to expect along the way. I am 39 and have two beautiful daughters. I am third generation with my mother and grandmother both having breast cancer in their forties.",
