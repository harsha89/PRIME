      "Content": "Hi All I was diagnosed with breast cancer christmas week 2009. It was classed as DCIS intermediate with no evidence of invasion, however a large number of ducts in my right breast were affected and a mastectomy recommended. I was given the option of reconstructive surgery at the same time as mastectomy, also centinal nodes were taken. I had a few problems post op and hadto return to theatre the day after due to a heamatoma, then i got aneamic needing a blood transfusion. I had several sessions at our local hospice for complimentary therapy, i'd recommend this as i found it  fantastic to help relaxation and pain relief.  However i'm much better now. I'm fortunate i did't need chemotherapy because my nodes were clear, but the borders of excision showed cancer right to the edge and radiotherapy recommended as optimum treatment and arimidex(alternative to tamoxifen) for 5 years I totally agree this year has been crap, but now i'm on the better side after just finishing 3 weeks of radiotherapy and didn't experience any ill effects other then redness. I'm really pleased with my reconstruction and getting back to some normaity now, will be having further surgery next year for nipple consruction. That is after a well earned cruise holiday which i've already booked. i've also registered to do a sponsered 10k midnight walk to raise funds for my local hospice. I wish you all well Viv",

      "Content": "Hi Hellie I agree the forums are a great help. I like yourself have a strong family history of breast cancer. My mother unfortunately died 16years ago aged 58years from breast cancer. My youngest sister had a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy recently and has just resumed work. She has had councelling and bloods taken for genetic screening. I was diagnosed at christmas and now  well on road to recovery, generally feeling great. I have a 24 year old daughter who is in process of going for genetic screening, however she is pregnant, so if tests prove positive she won't make a decision as to whether she will go down a double mastectomy route until after she's had baby. I can sympathise with you finding it hard to deal with, as we all probably do. You have good days where you'll feel strong and bad days where you feel its the end of the world. Ther are some great support agencies available, depending where in the country you live. You breast care nurse will be able to give you details of many outlets for relaxation and other therapies, which i found invaluable because although family provide a massive amount of support sometimes its better to get away from them for a while because i also found my family a great support but sometimes felt smothered by them. I wish you well for next wednesday Viv x   ",
