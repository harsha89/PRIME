      "Content": "Hi Gillian, Just curious as to where you are from? You sound like a northern girl like meself!! just the way you write, just a hunch :) Went to docs today for some new dressings as my wound hasn't stopped bleeding yet, he was miffed that he wasn't \"told\" about my biopsy results when I told him they had come back B3 he was shocked, but also thought I was telling him I had BC, til I expl that is not what it meant, and that it meant they actually didn't know. He had a look back and said it looks like they are talking about it being pre-malignant :O Not sure if thats true or not, but if so, is it likely to require any further treatment... I have all these questions lol   Take care   Hxx",

      "Content": "Hello, Erm, well, I'm not even sure I belong here yet. I'll explain as quickly as I can :) I had a lump biopsied a few weeks ago, and my consultant confirmed Fibroadenoma (my 4th one) but said he is going to remove as they pulled out abnormal cells too this time. He rated me at 3, smack bang in the middle, which gives me around 20-25% chance of BC. Low odds but also terrifyingly real that there is the possibilty that it is going to be bad. I'm 29 and had 2 operations in the past to remove the 3 fibroadenomas, they were completely benign, no abnormal cells found then... so why now? I have my WLE lumpectomy tomorrow, then have to wait 2-3 weeks for the histology results. I'm getting so nervous, there's more to this story but I'll spare you the details for another time (only because this would turn into a REALLY long post!) Thank you all for reading this far, feel free to kick me out if I shouldn't be here too :(   Hxx",

      "Content": "Hi Gillian, too true what you say about these sites, they are invaluable. Of course with the help of the internet I have managed to scare myself stupid too lol. Thank you for sharing your story too, and I'm pleased for you that you didn't need Chemo. Does this mean you are now cancer free? Or will they confirm that after your course of Tamoxifen? Sorry to ask but  I dont really understand how all this works yet, and of course not knowing whether I have BC myself or not yet... I'm going on again, sorry!!   Hxx",

      "Content": "Thank you KateG for your reply. I had the surgery yesterday and now have the 2ww fro the results, but I'm getting used to that now, though its still doing my head in. You understand also that being told \"don't worry, everything will be fine\" doesn't help as those that say it mean well, but don't actually know that and have no right to say it... so thank you for not saying it! Hope everything is ok with you, and thank you for your support and understanding :) Hx",
