      "Content": "my diagnosis, lumpectomy and radiotherapy went past in such a rush, and I did cope really well.  We also had a houseful of builders which added to the stress.  Once it was all over and the builders had gone, that's when I got weepy and started to feel emotionally vulnerable.  Anyone have any tips on how to get through this period? Thank you.",
