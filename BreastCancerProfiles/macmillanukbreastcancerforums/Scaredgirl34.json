      "Content": "Hello I was taken into hospital last Monday 4 days after chemo due to catching a sickness bug that half of my family had,while there my heart rate was 130 but did drop after a while,I was constantly being sick due to the bug..it lasted 7days..Doctor said I was fine to go home after 6hrs but said my liver bloods were high? This was the case last time after 1st case of chemo so my chemo drug was reduced by 20% but no the doctor from the hospital has referred me to have a ultrasound for my liver? Any1 has this I'm so worried they think the cancer has spread but not said! Not sure if my oncologist knows I've been sent for this ultrasound as it was the hospital doctor that has done it!  Just feeling abit worried,I've just been coming round to haveing BC and getting on with chemo n life!  Thanks sam xx",

      "Content": "Hello everyone I posted on here the other day regarding a letter being received from hospital after being admitted due to catching a bug!  Bloods for liver came back high which I had this problem after 1st cycle of chemo so my oncologist reduced my chemo 20% as I'm on HPTC  So I received a letter to be sent for an ultrasound on my abdomen and pelvis to check my liver by the hospital!  My diagnosis is Stage 1 maybe 2 as 1 lymph node is affected Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma 3cm tumour! Chemo has shrunk to tumour a lot after 3 cycles !  I rang my BC nurse to ask why I have been sent for this ultrasound as I'm very worried,she looked it up on computer and said it's just procedure the hospital have seen high blood results and just automatically referred me! She said it's nothing to worry about but why am I worrying? My 4th cycle out of 6 is tomorrow and I'm just getting to live with the fact that I have BC and hopefully will be cured...but this has own set me back and I'm thinking the worse ( has it spread ) would they know from the 1st bloods they take before cycle 1 if there was any signs of spread ( cancer ) It's really getting me down!  Sorry for the long post but I want to look forward to Christmas with my partner 15yr old daughter and family  Please help thanks sam xx",

This sound normal? I have Invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer 3cm lump in right breast! Breast nurse said Stage 1 Grade 3 ( aggressive)  I'm also worrying now that it could of spread knowing my underarm lymph node is affected,surely they should be giving me more tests or scans to see? All I'm having now before I see oncologist is Heart scan as I'm HER2 positive and a clip inserted to my breast as I'm having chemo before surgery ( so lump might shrink ) I can't contact anyone as breast nurses arnt available till Monday! I'm so scared overthinking again...has anyone else had a node affected and not had scans and it's not spread? Surely they must no by results?? Help please!!!!

( they talk that fast and in weird language I don\u2019t understand her ) As you no I put on here that my period had started 1st time since diagnosis in September 2017 so she\u2019s said as my BC was hormone fed Er and her2 positive that she thinks it\u2019s best to start having the Zoladex injection every 28days for 2yrs plus my Tamoxifen any1 have this? Also she added in there that it would be best to take this injection as I\u2019m High Risk? Does she mean in recurrence? As I know I was Grade 3? Sorry but just need my little mind putting at ease  Thanks Sam ",
