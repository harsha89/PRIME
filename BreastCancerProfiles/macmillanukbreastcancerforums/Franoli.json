      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, Welcome to the group! in my experience, I wear normal clothes to have chemo. It's helpful to make sure you have clothes which are reasonably loose so the nurse can access your veins easily. You can wear makeup, jewellery and your wig. At my hospital, my husband can come in with me and even another friend if there is space. There are beds in the unit but most people use the chairs as they are very comfortable and you can raise and lower the backs and footrests to suit yourself. You can ask for a blanket if you want. Personally, I have found the staff absolutely brilliant and they want to make things as comfortable as possible. We also get sandwiches, fruit and drinks in our unit. You can ask for a visit to the chemo unit before your first session so you can see for yourself what it's like. I haven't used the cold cap as I wasn't terribly bothered about losing my hair. I have a wig but don't wear it much. I also have scarves which I tend to wear more but I also go commando as I find that comfortable too. It just depends on your preference but I am sure there will be other people along to give you their experience of using the cold cap. If you have any other questions, do post them as we're all here to offer help and support. Shelley xx",

I have recently started having tax again and I had forgotten how painful it was. Take whatever painkillers you are offered but make sure the doctors understand before your next treatment just how awful it is. Did you sleep OK or do you need something to help with that, too? I find some doctors want me to take everything and some want me to take nothing. There is no inbetween! The main thing is that you feel as comfortable as possible throughout your treatment so make sure they understand how you feel. As others have said before, not every treatment feels the same so fingers crossed you won't feel as bad next time. Shelley xx",

      "Content": "Hi Squirrel, As everyone else will tell you, people react differently to chemo. I have inflammatory breast cancer and the protocol for that is chemo then MX then radiotherapy. I did notice some reduction in size of the tumour, probably around the time of the last FEC and first Tax but it can be difficult to tell. I wanted it to have shrunk but didn't want to be too optimistic in case I was wrong. Luckily, my oncologist is great and he also thought the tumour had shrunk and was very enthusiastic about it. when I had my MX he was proved right. It's a tough old ride you're on but it is do-able and everyone is so supportive on here, you will find answers to lots of questions (none of which are too basic to ask). I've found it an amazing support and continue to do so. Good luck with your treatment. With love, Shelley xx",

      "Content": "Not a good day yesterday. I was due to have a portacath fitted as my veins are poor so it was scheduled for yesterday, a week before my second round of FEC. It took an hour and 4 attempts to get a catheter in which they eventually put in my wrist. The nurses were brilliant and so patient - I felt sorry for them. Half way through admission onto the ward, the nurse was told to stop everything and the doctor came to tell me my cell count was too low and they thought it was too dangerous to do the portacath that day. Although I didn't have a temperature (and I have been good in checking it every day), they prescribed antibiotics just in case and sent me away. They'll give me another appointment and will have to delay my second dose of FEC. During the course of the day at the hospital, I developed a rash which itches like crazy. I asked the nurse about it but she said if I wanted to see the doctor, I would need to wait another hour as they were in clinic. I'd been there since 8.45 and it was now 2.30 and just wanted to get home and rest so said I would call if it got worse. It has been driving me mad all evening and now I've had to get up as I can't sleep. I still don't have a temperature and don't feel ill - just incredibly itchy which is driving me mad. I am guessing it's a reaction to FEC but I think I'll give my GP a ring in the morning and see if I can get some antihistamines. This week I had just started to think I could begin planning things (I'm self employed) and had tentatively put some dates in my diary for my 'good' weeks and now they will all be thrown out because my next round of chemo will be delayed. I am so fed up. I know in the great scheme of things a rash isn't anything much but it makes me feel like it's all beyond my control and regaining a measure of control over my life, particularly in work, was making me feel more like my old self. Sorry for the rant. You will know where I'm coming from, I'm sure. Now I'm going back to scratching!",

      "Content": "After my mastectomy, my wound got infected with MRSA. That got cleared up with some antibiotics which had awful side effects. I then started on 5 weeks of rads and 3 cycles of Tax. I have had 1 session of Tax and am due to have another on Wednesday. My wound has started to break down with the rads and is now open again like it was before. It's also hot and smells horrible. I've got it dressed and it's soaking the dressing each day. They took a swab on Friday so they can see what it's infected with but I am so fed up. I don't want it to delay chemo as the way the dates fall, I would be starting to feel better in time for Christmas which, although it may sound trivial, is important to me. My skin is very sore from the rads and I had a new portacath put in and the old one removed and that new site is also quite painful. They have placed it higher up in my chest and it hurts whereas the old one gave me no problems before (except the nurses couldn't access it properly). So I'm sitting here with very sore skin, a wound that smells, my hair is falling out (and it was starting to grow nicely since I finished earlier chemo in July), my nasal hair has gone so my nose is sore, my chest hurts and I am so very tired. I know we all suffer from side effects and things going wrong but I just feel I've had more than my share lately and it's getting me down. I'm feeling horribly sorry for myself which isn't attractive but it's hard to be smiling at the moment. My husband is brilliant and takes really good care of me but my body is letting me down. I just wanted a good whinge so it's great to have a space to do that. I hope others are having a better day and enjoying the sunshine. Hugs to all, Shelley xx",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the messages, guys. They really help. I'm just back from the hospital. I had to wait 3 hours to see the consultant but he looked at my wound and saw the swab results and said I'm not well enough to have Docetaxel today so I just had Herceptin. The wound is still very weepy so I've got antibiotics and some gel to put on it and am going back next week. We had planned a weekend away on 23/24 November to celebrate our anniversary but if I have chemo next Wednesday, I won't be feeling well enough. One of the Maggie's nurses said I could try delaying it until the following Monday which would allow us to go away (and for me to have a celebratory glass of wine) but would probably bugger up Christmas. She also advised that if it hadn't been delayed, I would probably end up in hospital for 2 weeks on a drip being really ill so she agreed with the consultant. We've decided to try and delay the chemo until Monday 26th so we can go away and the Oncology sister thinks that will probably be OK. I felt really upset about it earlier but now we've made some decisions, I feel a little brighter. I am a planner and all this stuff hits me hard as I can't plan anything! Like many of you, I'm glued to the sofa most of the time but thank goodness for the laptop, tv, books and knitting or I would go demented. At least there's no more rads to endure so I don't have to go out every day and can have a pj day if I want. Annie, I know you're having such a tough time at the moment so your post really touched me. We'll get through it somehow, however long that will be for. Sacha, ditto. You're going through the mill, too and you did suspect something like this might happen. Sheer experience (of the most horrible to have, I think). I hope you're all having better days than me but mine will be a brighter day tomorrow because that's how it goes. Lots of love, Shelley xx",

I have already had 3 FEC and 3 Tax but will be having 3 more Tax. I had my flu jab this afternoon and already feel very achey with pains in my legs and lower back and a little bit of a sore throat. I just don't feel well. Could I be imagining it or could it be coincidence? I don't know whether effects of the flu jab could be felt that quickly. Also, how has the flu jab affected anyone having it whilst having chemo? I just feel it's one thing after another at the moment, what with the MRSA and all (now thankfully cleared up) and the idea of feeling run down as I go into chemo AND radiotherapy (which begins on Monday) is no fun.

      "Content": "Hi Lettie, I always thought breast cancer would feel like a distinct lump but I did go to the doctor when my breast just felt 'wrong'. I know what you mean about general normal lumps and something different. My breast just felt lumpy - a bit like when you're a breastfeeding mother and you can feel the ducts underneath the breast tissue. My GP examined me and didn't think there was a problem although she did acknowledge there was a certain lumpiness. Unfortunately, mine turned out to be inflammatory breast cancer which is quite rare. BUT there are lots of other, more common reasons than cancer for a lumpy breast and you should go and get it checked out by your doctor. Remember, a GP doesn't have a lot of experience in breast cancer so you should ask for a referral as a matter of course. This doesn't mean I think you have a form of breast cancer but it's just that lumps and bumps need proper examination to find out what they are and the hospital is the best place to get that. The previous year I had a routine mammogram which showed a lump that I couldn't feel. I was very frightened but it turned out to be a harmless lump which needed no treatment at all. So you can see from both these scenario that you need to get expert advice to determine if there is a problem and if so, what the treatment might be. The not knowing is always the worst part so the sooner you make the appointment, the sooner you can get on with your life. Good luck! Shelley xx",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, I can only echo what others have said. It might feel weird feeling crap at the point when treatment has ended and life is returning to 'normal' but it's only because you are so busy firefighting when you are diagnosed and during treatment, you have no time to even consider how you feel. For many years I worked with families who had babies who were very ill or died very young and their experience is very similar. At the time when their babies were in hospital, they were so busy going backwards and forwards to the hospital, looking after the rest of their children and doing all the normal things, they had no time to think. It was only when life was getting back to normal and their babies were home and well that they began to feel anxious, depressed and had flashbacks. Their minds weren't always occupied with rushing about and getting things done so they had time to start reflecting on what had happened over the last months/years. I've spoken to lots of people who thought they were going mad or thought they shouldn't have the feelings they were experiencing because life was better! And it frightened them, too. It is SO normal to feel like you do. It's all part of the process and although it might be a bit unexpected when things are less hectic, it's all quite normal and will pass, like everything else has done. Yes, it feels strange when you probably expected to be getting on with life and I know I'm going to hit this wall and feel the same 'What the ***!!$Â£ !' but there is nothing we can do about it except take it in our stride. Crying is probably not a bad plan - it does release tension and. I feel a little like a ticking time bomb at the moment and that's not very comfortable but I'm going to have to learn to live with it. I hope it's good to know that you're not the only one feeling like this. You've probably helped others, too,Â  just by raising the subject. Big hugs, Shelley xx",

They will discuss your case at the weekly MDT meeting so everyone should be up to speed with your treatment plan. At the hospital I attend, on the day of my oncology appointment, I can specify if I want to see the consultant rather than the registrar and they will respect that so maybe try that again. It might also be worth telling your consultant of your previous experience and the effect it has had on your overall emotional health. It's no joke - we know a positive outlook helps so much so he should be on your side to help you achieve this. Once you have had your MX, the pathologist will check the tissue they have removed in minute detail and they may well test your tumour again to see if it is positive for either hormones or HER2 positive. It takes about 10 days to get the results back but they should have everything ready when you see your surgeon for your first appointment after the operation. I'm just really happy to hear you are now feeling taken care of. That's just how it should be as this journey is hard enough without feeling you are battling with your 'carers'.",

I've been taking Co-Codamol which I have presribed for another condition and they weren't even touching the side. Today I phoned the doctor and she's prescribed Dihydrocodeine and Diclofenac but my head still really hurts. I don't have a temperature but just am desperate to lose the pain. Does anyone else experience such terrible headaches? Shelley x",

      "Content": "Everyone seems to be working with a different wig scheme. At my hospital, you are given a huge catalogue to look through and then the wig lady comes along to discuss possibilities and help you choose a colour from a huge range of swatches. Most are fully funded but I paid a top up of Â£85 for mine as it has some special weave at the top which means it can be parted in any way and still looks quite natural. It is from the Raquel Welch collection and I looked it up online and it costs about Â£300. I am quite pleased with it but don't wear it that often, to be honest. I have a few scarves and Buffs which I tend to put on instead. I just haven't taken the time to get used to the wig and when I do wear it, I tend to pull it off after a while as it just doesn't feel like me. Maybe I should have chosen a different style or should get it cut or maybe I'm just not a wig person! If you have hair left, it's sensible to choose your wig early on so you can get a colour match or else choose something different if you feel like a change. Good luck with whatever you choose.",

      "Content": "Hi Sascha, I firmly believe you are in the right place. From my perspective, although I have chosen to have chemo, it's more a pro-life choice rather than anything else and I certainly wouldn't dream of judging your choice. No-one else can walk in our shoes nor know all the reasons behind the decisions we have to make so sod what anyone else thinks and just do what is right for you. It was clear from the beginning that you have thought through your decision very carefully which is good to hear although frankly, even if you'd decided to stand on your head for 2 hours every day as your treatment plan, that would be your choice and I still wouldn't judge you. Some people choose not to have treatment at all for a variety of reasons and that is their prerogative. It drives me mad when people think the only way to go is the way they have chosen. When that happens, I think it's often more through fear than anything else and they need everyone to be the same to validate their decision. But I'm straying from the point. If you feel you can still receive support here, then please stay. I don't comment on here very often but felt I had to offer my response to your posting. Shelley xx",

I was very worried about work and not being able to do any but found that the chemo took so much out of me that I actually felt I couldn't have done any work sensibly. A lot of my work involves training others which is quite tiring as it is and I also have to be on top form to answer any questions that get thrown at me. With the chemo fog, I found I just could not focus enough to feel I was doing a good job. Have Taxotere I found much worse than FEC and found I was just too exhausted to work as well as having some side effects from the treatment. I've come to terms with the idea that I won't be working until my treatment is finished and for me, that feels right so that I can concentrate on doing what I need to to get well again. I already have Fibromyalgia which has quite an impact on my energy levels. Everyone is different and I know some people have managed to work and carry on exercising or going to Zumba classes so we're all very different and you probably won't know how you'll be affected until you're actually having your chemo. If you can talk to your line manager beforehand to lay out some of the possibilities, that might help, and hopefully you will sail through it all. Fingers crossed, Shelley xx",

The car isn't even that old but it wasted my husband's complete day and he didn't get in until nearly 6pm :-( I find I really need sleeping tablets for the first few nights of Tax but my GP practice is really reluctant to prescribe them and will only give me 7 at a time. I really need to take 2 or I end up thrashing about all night and wake my husband up, too. Maybe they'll only let me have a few as I also have Ora-Morph for pain and they might worry I'd take them all together. I wouldn't but I suppose they don't know that. Having said that, I am so tired today (and had to stay awake for deliveries we were expecting instead of going back to bed) I might have a really early night and start the day better tomorrow.

I seem to have got on quite well without hospital admissions although a fair few A&E visits. My head feels fit to burst this morning and everything hurts, including eyeballs and buttocks. How does that work, eh? My mouth is sore and my tongue is white. I should be attending the funeral of a friend who died last week of this horrible disease but I don't think I could do it without falling over and making an exhibition of myself. I'd also have to do a lot of groaning as each pain made itself known. I feel weird today - can you tell? I'm glad you've got your husband to take care of you and to chivvy you along when you're feeling you're at the end of your tether. I'm sure Tax has a profound effect on my cognitive reasoning as I do feel emotionally bizarre while I'm feeling the side effects. I'm at the stage now where they will only monitor me symptomatically and I'm worried about that. My reflexologist (at a cancer centre) and massage therapist (at another cancer centre) both asked me about my back when I had treatments last. They wanted to know if I had back pain and I was told I had 'hot spots' there. Is that enough to go to the oncologist with? I think they'll think I'm mad but I'm left wondering. This bloody disease. Nothing is straightforward. If you're in a nice, warm bed, you are definitely in the right place. Relax as much as you can and focus on the horrible powers of Tax. It's good at kicking ass. I'm in for a day on the sofa and will maybe try and knit a bit. I can't bear to do nothing but I'm limited in what I can do at the moment. Take care of yourself and breathe deeply.

Today I got the results and the 2mm cyst is still there but so is a 4cm lesion which is new. I finished FEC-T in July, had a full MX with axillary node clearance at the beginning of August and have had 6 cycles of Herceptin. The oncologist wanted me to have 3 further cycles of Docetaxel which I was due to start today but he has now postponed that pending a liver biopsy which he has asked for urgently and we should have results in 2 weeks. I think they will be the longest 2 weeks of my life. I am starting radiotherapy next week for 5 weeks and that will go ahead for the time being as will Herceptin but he is clearly thinking of what other treatments he could give me. I asked him what it might be if it was not a secondary and he said he just didn't know. He said it is very unusual for this to happen and clearly the size of the lesion is quite shocking (well, to me, anyway). He seemed quite shocked, too, and gave me a nice little squeeze at the end of the consult. I really didn't expect this result at all. I was thinking we were crossing the i's and dotting the t's by having this extra scan so to find out there may be a problem is a terrible shock and I feel quite numb. I don't know what to do next except try to breathe and think positively but that feels quite hard right now. Cancer is totally shit, isn't it? Hugs to all, Shelley xx",

It's taken weeks for it to start to sink in. I also started with chemo and will then have surgery followed by radiotherapy so we have long roads ahead of us. For me, it has helped to be very upfront with people and tell them I have cancer. I try to use the word so it won't be a taboo. I have a secret Facebook page for my closer friends and can update them there on how I'm feeling and receive support too. No-one else can see the page unless I add them so if you're a Facebook user, it might be something to think about. I find emotions come over me at the strangest times. I had to leave my OH in Tesco yesterday and go and sit in the car and have a little weep. I have no idea why but I just needed to do it so if you can try to go with how you feel, that might help. I haven't liked some of the tests I've had but feel I'm in good hands so trust my oncology team. There is no right or wrong way to get through this but get through it you will. There is so much support here and people really DO understand where you're coming from and I find that hugely helpful. I don't always post but read most of the posts and feel I'm part of a community. Be as gentle as you can with yourself, be kind to yourself and try and take each minute as it comes. Some will be good, some will be bloody horrible but they will all pass.

You can mitigate the effects of Tax with loads of things depending on how it hits you and some people don't react too badly to it at all so it just depends. I know you've had an incredibly rough ride over the last few months - I think you were diagnosed shortly after I was - but even after Tax there are other treatments. It's just like getting a recipe right and sometimes they are luckier or more skilled than at other times. Whatever makes you feel even vaguely good, do it.

      "Content": "Hi Annie, It's all normal stuff you describe. Horrible but quite normal and we each deal with it every day in whatever way we can. My husband is really good and does a lot of the housework so I'm very lucky there. We have a dog and 3 cats so he cleans their trays and walks the dog each day as I find I'm really exhausted for about 10 days after chemo. I sometimes go out with them at weekends as we can drive somewhere nice and walk slowly rather than a quick run round the local fields. I think pets are a good thing to have provided you're prepared for any extra work and expense. Our dog is a Saluki so needs lots of running but then likes to sleep on the sofa or in his basket for the rest of the day. He HAS to run, though, or he gets very twitchy, but really an hour is enough for him. So in terms of not too much exercise needed, sighthounds are a good option (think whippet, greyhound etc) and there are certainly plenty of those in need of rescue. Puppies take a lot of work and you do need to be around all the time when they are little. Cats are relatively easy. Kittens are a lot of fun (though again, you need to be there for them when they're little) and they're much more independent than dogs but can be just as cuddly and all pets will make you laugh. I'm off for my first meditation class tomorrow which I hope will help with stress and allow me to calm myself when I need to. It's at a local cancer centre who provide all kinds of treatments and classes free of charge so it might be worthwhile looking to see if there is something similar where you live. You'll also meet other people and I have enjoyed doing that, too. Keep going. You're getting through each day despite how awful you feel at times and you will find the strength from somewhere.

      "Content": "Hi Scarlett, I am in a similar situation to you. I am being treated for inflammatory breast cancer and have had 6 cycles of FEC-T and a total MX with full ancillary node clearance. I am having Herceptin and am due to start radiotherapy for 5 weeks on Monday. I was also going to have 3 further cycles of Tax as a safeguard as IBC is so aggressive. I saw the oncologist a couple of weeks ago and he said he would re-scan my liver as they had found a 2mm lesion on it which he thought was a cyst but he wanted to put my mind at rest. When I saw him this week, he said the 2mm lesion is still there and they still think it's a cyst BUT they had found a new 4cm lesion. I was totally shocked as I wasn't expecting anything like this. I haven't finished my treatment for IBC and so this has really thrown me. I am due to have a liver biopsy early next week and will know the results within 2 weeks. My extra chemo has been postponed although I am continuing with Herceptin and the radiotherapy to my chest area. I can really empathise with how you feel and wish I could make it all go away for you. I did post in the Liver cancer secondaries forum and received some really helpful and comforting replies so it may be worth you looking there. At the moment, we don't know what our lesions are so I am trying to hold onto that and look on the positive side. If it is anything sinister, they have found it early and there are some good treatents out there. Yes, it's changed my plans (yet again) but it's got to be got through, like all the other treatments we've had. I see an excellent psychologist at the hospital who works just with cancer patients and I am finding that really helpful. Could you access anything like this where you are being treated? Ask your BCN or see your GP. I have had some very dark moments and I'm not sleeping well, either, but I've got good support from family, friends and the forum and that's enormously helpful. It's just playing the waiting game that is so bloody difficult. Take good care of yourself and try to lose yourself in a book or a film for a couple of hours. Take a walk, listen to music - anything that can stop that endless cycle of 'what if' going through your head. Sending you big hugs, Shelley xx",

      "Content": "I hope someone can answer my question as it's driving me mad. I had an MX with full node clearance at the beginning of August 2012. Over the last week or so, I've noticed a slight swelling in my hand and forearm on the side of the MX. I went to see my BCN on Friday who said she thinks it's mild lymphodema and is referring me to see a specialist but a doctor at the hospital has also referred me back to see the surgeon on Tuesday in case there is also a clot there. My question is... I have a really badly swollen knee on the other side which came out of nowhere on Thursday/Friday. It was so painful in the night it woke me several times (not that sleeping is that good anyway). Is it possible that this is related to the lymphodema? Does any swelling always happen near the site of the lymph removal? I want to ask the doctor on Tuesday but don't want to sound a complete idiot if it's impossible so thought I would ask if anyone here knows before I make a fool of myself. Hope all you Mums are having a good day. Shelley xx",

I have been pushing things the last few days as we've been away on a short break but I wondered if this was normal or is it something I should raise with my BCN? I don't have a temperatute and it doesn't look like there is an infection (as far as I can tell) but it's just leaking this sticky fluid. Anything anyone can tell me would be really helpful.

      "Content": "Hi Sam, I'm so sorry to hear this. I haven't had a reconstruction, just a straight MX and ANC. I saw the BCN yesterday and the wound is weeping and starting to re-open in one place. I was given strong antibiotics and the wound was dressed with a seaweed dressing (which is apparently very good and also very expensive) and given some dressings to use myself. I go back next week for them to take another look. I'm sure its a devastating blow to you and really hope the operation goes well. You will get over this setback although it may not feel like it just now. Even without reconstruction, it took me a while to be able to look at my ex-breast but I can do it now and even admire the work the surgeon has done on the section that has healed well. I'm sorry that things haven't gone well but will keep my fingers crossed that the next stage will go well and you'll soon be back on track.",

      "Content": "Thanks, girls. We were travelling back from our first weekend break this year so I emailed my BCN and she got back to me late afternoon. I'm going to go in and see her tomorrow before I see the ONC to find out why he wants to give me more chemo after 6 sessions and MX. I've put a dressing on the leaking bit now and that feels a bit better. It's made me very emotional, though. Cancer can ruin anything and everything. We just wanted a quiet week away and even that was too much to ask. We had to squeeze it in between an appointment on Thursday and one on Tuesday. I just feel really tearful and down and very sorry for my OH. It's bloody neverending, no matter how much I try to do the right things or how upbeat I try to be. I know other people are having a really difficult time, too, but I feel like I'm quietly going to explode into a sludge of utter misery. Sorry to share that but sometimes I just need to get it out there.",

      "Content": "I had my second dose of Tax last Friday and have been feeling quite unwell this week. I had a temperature one evening but it went down again so I didn't go to hospital. I just find that I have no appetite at all and this is a real change. I ate normally throughout FEC but this time find I have an upset stomach which, crazy though it sounds, I've found quite upsetting. The SE's just don't want to go away. My husband cooked me some lovely salmon yesterday with stir-fried vegetables and I could literally only manage a couple of mouthfuls. There is nothing I even fancy eating. I can't taste a lot of flavours but can still taste sweet things although I have no desire to eat them. I haven't eaten chocolate for weeks! I was really worried about putting on weight through the chemo but at this rate, I'll be losing weight (although I did put some on initially). What I'm more concerned about it not eating a balanced diet and getting all the nutrients I need. Has anyone else had this experience on Tax? I feel weak and just sorry for myself. I was expecting to feel better by today so it's really disappointing not to. Sorry for the whinge, especially when I know so many people are worrying about weight gain. I honestly thought that would be the group I'd be in. Has anyone had a similar experience?",

      "Content": "Hi all, It's really interesting to read people's different experiences and quite reassurring. I'm also eating fruit at the moment as it's one of the only things I really feel like eating. I vary it quite a lot and make sure it's all different colours as that is also supposed to be good. I just can't face the idea of a full meal but I could eat a salad, maybe. Like others, I have gone off chocolate! That is extraordinary as I normally love it and it's sweet but I just have no interest. No interest in alcohol, either. It's almost like my body is selecting specific foods and as they're not bad, I'm going with it. I've had much worse tongue and mouth ulcers with this dose of Tax than any other, despite using Difflam regularly. I just keep thinking - just one more to go! Thanks for all the tips. I could do with losing weight anyway so this may be a boost for me in that way but I will be careful I'm eating a mix of things in my diet. If it's still like this next time I go to hospital, I will mention it, just in case. Shelley xx",

Like Saxxy I used a good nail strengthener - OPI Nail Envy - underneath and on top and my nails have gone white but I have't lost any. When you see the Docetaxel you will see it is given with a light protecting cover over it so I suppose the drug itself is light sensitive and so it sort of makes sense to light protect your nails, too. Don't forget your toe nails! Â  Good luck!",
