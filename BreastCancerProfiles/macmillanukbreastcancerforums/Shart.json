      "Content": "Hi Beth567 Ive just joined this site/group as I\u2019ve just been shopping today for a mastectomy bra and got so fed up, and need help/advise too.  I too have BRCA 1 and having a double mastectomy on 5th June with delayed reconstruction. I am also a 40 DD and have been told that they will not be able to reconstruct to same size and will be smaller   I haven\u2019t so far been offered anything or advised through the hospital or BCN so I think after having such a crappy day today trying to find a bra or two and reading the posts on here I think that might be the best option.  With my surgery being so close now I\u2019m really starting to worry about being flat and then what the reconstruction will look like so I completely understand your apprehension. However I do keep telling myself it\u2019s the best thing to do. On the other hand I sometimes think it will be quite nice to not have big boobs in the way, or to have to wear a bra all the time.  I hope you get your answers you need and start to feel better about what you are having to go through. It is reassuring that it hopefully will not be too painful, I had my ovaries and tubes out at the beginning of April and was off my feet for about a week or so but the pain subsided after 5/6 days and was totally manageable with paracetamol.  Take care. ",

      "Content": "It was m&s I went to, I just don\u2019t think I was feeling it. It\u2019s all just becoming a bit real now. There was quite a large selection I thought, it\u2019s a big m&s that I went to.  I\u2019m having implants not the tissue transfer surgery ( is that what deip is ). Not really sure what the end result is going to look like, what the shape or size will be so looking for bras that fit me now I think is a bit of a waste of time.  Anyway I\u2019ve decided to call my BCN and ask and contact the shop that specialises in mastectomy bras nicola or Nicole something or other, and ask questions and get some more advise.  All the best with your surgery, and then with the reconstruction and finding some comfortable and pretty bras",
