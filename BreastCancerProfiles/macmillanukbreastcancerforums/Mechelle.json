      "Content": "Hi LIndy, I did feel very upset when I left I wouldn't expect any different treatment just because of the cancer or chemo pending just think it's a sad world when people can't politely let you down... I' m a forgiving person so wouldn't want to make a complaint but if the Chemo ward sister is abrupt on my next visit I will mention it to my bcn as none of us want to be there or I daresay look forward to going but would be nice to think the ward sister did smile once in a while and she has chosen to be there !! My appt is 9am on Monday  so hoping everyone will be refreshed from the weekend .. As for a waiting period from surgery to chemo I' m guessing that's also a funding matter and just happy to get the ball rolling at last... many thanks for your support  Mechelle xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee, thank you for the welcome and thank goodness for places like this website ! I' m sure I' m not the first person to get attitude in life and usually can brush curtness under the rug it just made me feel very low and as I live on my own I went home feeling awful but didn't mention it to my family and friends when they phoned as naturally they have been worried for me and were keen to hear I' d roughly have a date to start so didn't want to extend their anxiety so said a date would arrive in the post!! Like I said always someone worse off and I feel for you having to wait for the oncology dept to fit you in as it seems all the waiting and not knowing is the worse bit ! Good luck with whatever stage you are at.. Mechelle xx",

      "Content": "Hi KateG, thanks for your thoughts I do agree about some receptionists and to be fair to the snappy one I had it was absolutely jammed packed in the waiting room,there was a queue of people behind me and her phone never stopped at what I can imagine is an impossible job for her to have a 45 year old woman sobbing as I couldn't be fitted in wasn't her fault all the dates were booked  it's the lack of nhs funds I guess and think the stress just got to her - I' m sure she has to deal with demanding people all day which I know is no excuse hopefully she went home and I may of crept into her mind as to how abrupt she came across which hopefully made her a slightly more approachable person the next day.. I' 've read through several chats and have felt a lot better knowing this place exists and the advice people give is going to help and I' m sure there will be a lot of questions in the near future I will be asking.. take care and thank you  Mechelle xx",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with hormone receptive grade 2 bc 8th Oct and had surgery on 17th Oct..I have taken everything in my stride and calmly just got on with whatever was to come next due to all the brilliant care and positivity  at High Wycombe hospital in Bucks.. My Oncology appt was 11th Dec at Stoke Manderville also Bucks, my Oncologist was a lovely man who was surprised he' d not seen me sooner but filled me with confidence by saying my 1st fec treatment would be between Xmas and New yr..Great I thought to to be getting on with the next step and confidently went to reception as told to book a follow up appt for 5 wks time . What a surprise to be told by the sullen faced receptionist there' s no way it would take place as they were too busy to fit me in??? I was speechless and tearful luckily my bcn was nearby and did her best to reassure me all would be sorted and not to worry!! she calmed me down and took me to meet the Chemo nurses to buck me up. She introduced me  and told them I' d  be seeing them between Xmas and New yr and again abruptly the ward sister said \"no she won't we're fully booked it'll be way into Jan\" like I wasn't even in the room !!! So I went from MRS calm to MRS distraught until my appt eventually came via a phone call to start my 1st fec next Monday  at last!!!!!! I also have a talk and tour of unit this Friday..Very apprehensive as I' m sure everybody is when they start the unknown but hoping and praying I just caught everyone on a bad stressy day the last time I was there !!The film ' one flew over the cookoo' s nest' springs to mind and feel a Jack Nicholson rebellion is going to be my mind set to get through the depressing attitudes hopefully they will all be slightly happier although I understand it must be a very stressful job but I felt very much like a number that day !! So moan over and back to positive thinking for whatever may come my way as there' s always someone worse off so think myself lucky and Will go with the flow ! Good luck to everyone going or about to go through treatment and stay mentally strong xxx",
