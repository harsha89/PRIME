      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and got to have a mastectomy. I'm still at the meeting plastic surgeons, oncologist and nurses stage so I don't have a operation date yet. I'm trying to get my head around it and also trying to get a little bit organised.... Any tips on what to pack and any essentials I might need for the operation and stay in hospital after. Thank you xxx",

      "Content": "Thank you Ruby Rose for the reply. I'm having the mastectomy and then reconstruction at the same time on my right, I got told that I didn't have enough tummy to use so am now thinking towards an implant. I'm not sure I want scars on my back, thighs or bum checks. Also, the length of surgery time is frightening me, although I won't know anything about it! It all feels like a dream, well nightmare. Wishing you well on your journey. Love and hugs. Chatter is good, it kees your mind occupied. Xxx",
