      "Content": "Thank you for your help. Don't feel like talking to my family or friends as I need to support them. Hopefully this will end soon, she has 2 more chemo sessions then a mastectomy and finally 2 weeks of radiotherapy and finished with 5 years of tablets. It's nice to talk to someone other than doctors or close relatives. I hope you are well now? Please tell me it gets better and easier? Xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi, Im 18 years old and I just want some advice. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at the beginning of September and so far she's had 4 lots of chemo with 2 more to go. The first 3 were ok and she was mostly tired but got better within a week however, the last one was sent through her bones and it hit her really hard. She was admitted to hospital for a few days when her white blood count came down but she's a lot better now and the doctors have said thy will reduce the amount she has next time. She's been so emotional this past fortnight and as much as I try to console her I don't know how she feels and she worries me constantly, I can't sleep properly and every time I see her my heart breaks cause I know she's in a lot of discomfort. I think my mums amazingly brave and every other woman who has to deal with this. I just need someone to listen as I don't want to upset my mum anymore with my own worries as she has enough on her plate already. X",

      "Content": "Thank you this has helped a lot and I feel better now I have spoken out since I first heard the news. I think your all amazing women having to put up with this. I find it hard to talk to her about it as I don't want to upset her so i just don't talk to anyone to spare everyone's feelings and emotions but at the same time I need help and only recently have I thought about asking for help as I'm usually the one who suffers behind closed doors. I recently started university and have found the distance from my mum especially hard as we only found out the diagnosis 2 weeks before I was to started UNI. She's says that she feels better when she knows I'm concentrated on my work and not worrying about her but when she's had the past 3 chemos I've not been home and after the latest one it came as a shock to what she's really like rather than what it has been saying (I assume its because she's protecting me). I feel like crying all the time but tend to do it after she's gone to sleep. Even on here I feel like I'm moaning amongst people who have it and I don't, I just don't know who else to say it too.

Thankfully I'm not that far from home about an hours drive from UNI to home and when she has her surgery I'll be home more often. My dad is home a lot thanks to his work and my grandparents live nearby and also my auntie lives across town so we have a very good network where there's always someone around to help. Nicole xx",
