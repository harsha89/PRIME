Many thanks.",

I have had a few days where I have just broke down and cried since being diagnosed, it\u2019s my kids that keep me going and make me stay positive, also my grandmother that I lost the week I found out about my cancer, she had a liver transplant 6 years ago, her strength and positivity were phenomenal, I think I am like her, I know if she was here today she would want me to have the strength that she did. Take care. Xx",
