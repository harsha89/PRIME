    "Content": "HiÂ  Great that you have finished chemo. I experienced this too. I had the salt and/or cardboard taste throughput the Docetaxal treatments and beyond. I lived off skinny latte and poached eggs which I only then managed to eat 2 or 3 times a week. For me this has got to be up in the top ten of worse side effects suffered! It lasted beyond treatment but things started to improve approx 7 weeks after with a gradual improvement to near normal. Chocolate still has an off taste 10 months on, which is no bad thing! I know how horrific this can be be but have faith and hang on in there it does improve x",
