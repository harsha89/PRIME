      "Content": ", Hi ladies..just looking for a bit of advice here.  I had a mastectomy a couple of weeks ago and sentinel lymph nodes taken for biopsy.  Scar is healing well but I do have swelling , seems to be where they took lymph nodes, it is warm to touch.  Loads of pain in arm but no swelling.  I have appointment to see oncologist on 20th to get biopsy results and discuss follow on treatment.  Not sure whether what is happening just now is normal or should I see doc before 20th.  Thanks xxx.   ",
