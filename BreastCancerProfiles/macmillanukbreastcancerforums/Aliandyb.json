      "Content": "Good afternoon everyone,  I finished my chemotherapy last Thursday, thought I was maybe coming down with a cold, chest was a bit tight and a small cough, chemo went ahead anyway and I was told okay to take paracetamol up until this coming Thursday, just finished steroids last night but my chest is still not right and I have a phlegmy cough. I'm trying to hang on until tomorrow to see how I feel, may then ring GP, don't want to end up in hospital especially as I have my radiotherapy planning appointment on Friday, do you think I'm okay to wait until then?",
