I'm a good sleeper and go straight off normally and still do but am only managing 2 hours before waking and not being able to get fully back again. I'm on 3 days steroids, ended yesterday, so don't suppose they help. First round I did sleep better as days passed but not fully back to my norm. Anyone any ideas as to what has helped them would be gratefully received. I love my sleep!!",

I also had two thermometers and both read completely different so not sure how accurate they are. I did check with chemo nurse when I went in for second FEC and they were not too worried especially given my normal 36 but said if I felt unwell to call and check. I think it s natural to worry and on first FEC I took it every day for nearly two weeks, but relaxed a bit more on second one, and third one I just checked when I had a headache and before taking any pills. So for me nothing to worry about but do check with your chemo unit if you need to, they don't mind. xx",

I saw Registrar on Monday who has put me on the annual mammogram check as well as six monthly monitor, and who after much pushing agreed to a CT scan when everything has settled down. However, she was not able to answer a fair few questions and so am thinking I want to raise this further. I think my next steps are asking for another appointment with the actual consultant, but woukd be interested to hear of follow on experience. I know we are going to be anxous once done and dusted but I have Stage Three Occuit Cancer, no breast tumour found, and so could not be graded, and they were not able to remove all my affected lymph nodes at surgery. Now I'm told its 'likely' its gone but can't be sure. It was also classed as Locally Advanced, with radio to Breast, chest wall, underarm and clavicle, but no spread to other parts body. This latter being based on previous scans. Thanks. X",

I have just had my last of 3 FEC today, and will have the first of T on 15th October and cannot believe I am halfway through it's going so fast.  I did choose to go the cold cap route as I was told success rate was 50/60%. The cap has to fit well and be on for quite some time but I felt it was worth a shot. However, it did not work for me, I lost about 20% after 1st FEC which was not a problem due to very thick hair, but started loosing large chunks about 5 days after 2nd one so admitted defeat at that point and shaved it off and got a wig, although I do still seem to have quite a bit on top and need a shave again.  Funnily enough I have also kept a lot of other hair so far, e.g. eyebrows and eyelashes but will see how goes with this one.   But talking to other ladies there at the moment, two are having a huge degree of success and I had a friend who hired one (very very expensive) and she kept her hair.  So guess it is your choice at end of day. For me, I am glad I tried but was relieved to shave it when it started to be obvious it was going.  Wig is getting fave reviews as in 'great cut and colour' Good luck whatever your choice, and with FEC T, not been too bad for me so far.

I think it's all the fear of the unknown isn't it but with lots of help and advice and using that help and advice to find what works for you, as well as what you feel comfortable with, it becomes a bit more bearable. I too had a thick shoulder length bob and had a haircut a week before chemo but only to its normal 'short' point.  With hindsight I may have chosen to cut it a bit more, but think I would have personally found it difficult to cope with a 'new' style and the comments I might have got at that point. I found it ok after FEC 1, could manage the shedding, but when it started to come out in chunks after FEC 2, I persevered for  week and did get quite stressed by the strips that came out so shorter might have been better at that point.  I also did not get a wig in advance, as 'knew' I was one of the % who would keep it, so had a complete panic trying to get a quick appointment.  So totally sensible to get your wig appointment sorted so you have time to think about what you want. I am now totally happy with wig, took about a week for me to get used to it, now its on and in place in a few minutes and I think looks good. It slipped a bit when had a little too much hair, but when shaved stayed on perfectly. And biggest surprise of all, my head shape was not at all bad. Those that have seen it, including my hairdresser were also surprised at how it looked.  So when grows back may well stick to a new short style after having had the bob for years. Good luck for first FEC and with the hair, it really does work for some people and do not regret for one minute giving it a go. xx",

      "Content": "I'm slightly with Macrad on this one, although I expect for some people R1 & R2 do seem to work and I have to say I asked for these and my health authority in Surrey would not prescribe, hospital or GP. But ultimately absolutely right, no magic solution. And dreamthief is also right, it would be great to have something that seemed really definitive, if there was proper research on much more of this kind of thing it would save a lot of questions and anxiety. Throughout this whole thing, and the confusion, the advice I have received has been in the main great, but you also have to find what works for you as an individual and go with that. I stayed on good old E45 lotion and lasted until Day 18 of 30 before I started getting some radiation damage. I also supplemented with Aloe Vera if feeling a little hot at times. I would put the Aloe straight on after my session and E45 later in the day and as needed, worked wonderfully for me. I also found in my switch to non perfumed stuff generally that E45 made a huge improvement to the very hard skin on my feet. Prior to this I had used expensive foot creams but nothing seemed to have worked as well. When I did get some radiation burns over three separate sites I was prescribed Medi-Honey barrier cream by the hospital and I have to say this was a complete miracle for me. It took out all the burning feeling instantly and where the skin was broken it protected and repaired it, in what seemed to me a very short time, 48 hours, I was amazed, but genetically I do seem to have good skin and that will have made a difference. The medi-honey is probably a bit of a postcode lottery as well though, as was told that my health authority had only just received funding for it when I was able to get hold of it. Good luck to all, I'm 8 weeks after end radio now and have what I describe as 'prickly' skin, but have healed well. x",

When we left to come home yesterday though and was saying goodbye I burst into tears I suddenly felt so down again, but was fine after drive home. So emotions all over the place, but you are so right, another year on and I am sure will be different. Also realised that a big change in my mood came a week after starting Tamoxifen and that one of the side effects is Mood Swings, so could be on those also. I certainly started to get hot flushes around then also.  And I thought all was done with those!!! Started radio today and looking forward to ticking those off and finding me again. Here's to 2016, and lots positive thoughts. And to be able to share and receive support xxx",

I ache all over although it does get better as I get going but everything is a huge effort. I would just like to hibernate. Not helped by everyone I meet telling me I look really great. Keep getting complements on hair, skin and the little bit of weight I have lost. I really want to tell everyone actually I might look okay but I feel absolutely rubbish most of the time, grrrr. I know I have just got to work it through and hopefully get to the point whereby I start to feel a bit more like my old self again, but when your in the midst of it, it sure does not feel like it will ever get better. Actually, on a brighter note,for those just starting chemo, if someone asks me in six months time how it was I will probably say not so bad, FEC was fine for me and while T was much more difficult I do feel pleased its now over, but it was doable for sure. Just wished I could feel my happy optimistic self again. I'm sitting at work taking a break at the moment and have no motivation although fortunately in the run up to Christmas its very quiet. Anyhow, rant over, just wanted to get it out there with people who know what it feels like, I'm sure I would rant as much if people told me I looked rubbish, lol.. This site has been a life saver when questions have arisen or when just feeling done, so a big thanks to MacMillan and everyone for just listening. I hope everyone has a lovely Christmas and New Year, as I am sure I will when with family and friends. See, I am more optimistic already just from being in contact!! xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Sleepy Mushroom I was diagnosed with Occult Breast Cancer in May of last year and you are one of the few people I have met who also have this diagnosis. I started by having all of my lymph nodes removed following a positive result in my SN as I was told this was the safest option, they could then all be checked for spread and hopefully clear margins. You mentioned yours had shrunk, does this mean no evidence off them left or just smaller? And are you having rads? I had the op done In June, followed by 6 x Fec-T, and 25 sessions of rads which ended in Feb. Now on Tamoxifen.  I now have mild lymphoedema but it is mild and very manageable and I generally have okay mobility in arm/shoulder affected. My bigger side effects came from the rads and the Tamoxifen but are all manageable. For me personally I was happy to have them all out in the hope that this alongside chemo and rads would put me into remission and stop spread. For me there did not seem to be another option but if there is an option for you not to have full clearance I would certainly discuss that. Mine was also classified as advanced local but on all initial scans there was no sign anywhere else in my body. The topic of mastectomy was also discussed but my surgeon and onc said this is no longer done as a matter of course as in the past and that rads to the breast in question was recommended but that was my choice, I am now struggling to get appropriate follow-up having initially only been offered the annual mammogram. And while I am happy to have this as nothing was found in my breast so far I felt other follow-up was needed. It's now been agreed I can have a CT scan which is a step forward. I was told they were not able to clear all my affected nodes, 16 taken out, all affected, and some evidence of others that could not be reached without nerve damage etc. So I am hopeful chemo and rads have worked, and hence wanting further scans. Good luck with your conversations, bit scary not knowing where it came from, but be interested to hear your treatment plan and progress. Susie xx ",

      "Content": "Hi Sleepy Mushroom Seem to be doing okay so far, on Tamoxifen now and just waiting for a mammogram and CT scan to see if any evidence of disease. Saw surgeon and radio consultant yesterday and they were happy with progress so far. The radio consultant said no reason that chemo and radio should not have worked, but am sure I will be anxious until scans confirm if clear. And yes, I still struggle with not knowing where the primary came from and the extent of it. Because of this there was no grade, and stage was based on spread. I researched occult quite heavily but information was always a bit sketchy. I did find out it was even rarer than originally told as cancers previously diagnosed as Cup or Occult are increasingly spotted with more sophisticated diagnostics. I had radiotherapy underarm and on my clavicle, as well as on whole of the breast that the source supposedly came from. I was given the option of not having it on the breast but was recommended primarily for arm and clavicle as that was where they could see evidence of disease. I was told that while breast was my choice it was also recommended as it would be harder to align it again if I needed it later.  The dose I had of 30 sessions (25 in the end) was much higher than norm these days and was because of not knowing its origin. So could have been a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I don't know for sure. I have a very tight and 'shrunken' boob although its not so noticeable with bra on, and was told due to clavicle area radiation some lung damage and most likely arthritis when older, but all okay for now. It is difficult isn't it when we have information, which can be conflicting at times, but as I had extensive evidence of disease in my lymph nodes the surgery was a sensible option, followed by chemo to clear the rest and radio as belt and braces. Talk to your surgeon if still not sure. I am comfortable with where I am now in terms necessity of the treatment plan but often look back and think if I knew then what I know now I would ask different questions. xxxx",

      "Content": "Jen You've every right to feel and be emotional, its a pretty emotional time. I think its clear your husband is in denial, or perhaps this is his usual way of dealing with things. have you tried talking to him about how you feel? It may not work but at least you will know you have tried. have you also tried asking him to or taking him to one of your appointments so he can see what it is really like. e.g. confusing, emotional scary, just about everything in the book. In the main I have a very supportive partner but he used to give me an 'allotted time' post my chemo or rads sessions, and the minute I said I felt almost my old self that was my time up. All the things like washing up and getting me cups of tea stopped until next time, or until I pointed this out to him. He did however, come to appointments with me and has been very pragmatic when I have been having melt-downs. At one point I got pretty upset with him telling everyone on the phone I was fine when I was not, but talked to him, and this was his bit of denial and way of dealing with it. Post this he took the time to ask me how I was really feeling, not just my 'brave' face. Do try to talk to him if not already done so, but if not, do tell someone you can talk to how you are feeling, a close friend etc, it's a hard old time and we all need the support we can get. I have a great friend who has supported me throughout, we meet for coffee and have 15 minutes of 'me' and how I feel before moving on to gossip and cake. Works wonders.  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lizz We are all different, not sure what chemo you are having but mine was FEC T and it really was not that bad.  After each FEC the side effects kicked in more or less straight away but I was pretty much normal after 5/6 days. T was tougher for me and side effects lasted longer but some people also deal with this fine. I read the article and understand what you mean, but basically she's right in one sense, and that's the overall sense in that we would not do it unless we have to. Which we do.So she's just expressing how horrible it was for her in her own way, unfortunate that it is expressed this way for so many to see but that's how she felt.. Mine finished in Dec and if people ask me now I can totally honestly say not that bad and it passed pretty quickly.  She sneers a little at 'doable' but it is 100% doable, and she did it. Doable means you can get through it, and you will. . Perhaps the Guardian need some 'counterbalance' stories. I watched a programme the other day about diet that Fiona Phillips was narrating and those on a detox did much worse than those on a healthy diet. I have to say by end chemo I could not eat much and was living on ice cream but two three weeks into Dec, all taste buds came back. I feel sure if I had 'detoxed' I would have wasted away. For chemo number six I did have to force myself to eat little and often as my 'enforced detox' was making me weaker and weaker. As soon as I got back to eating I picked straight up. As for the hair, three of us started with Cold Cap at same time, worked for the other two, not for me. But had a fab wig which I am ditching most of the time now, and personally cant think of anything worse than going somewhere every three/four weeks to have my hair glued back on like mentioned!! Being honest, it was a shock when I lost it, but that passed to. Forget about deserving to feel terrible, you might feel rough at some stage, or not as in some cases. But you don't 'deserve to', its just something we have no choice but to get through. Just prepare, be kind to yourself, and you will be with us soon giving advice to those just about to start. xxx",

To be honest, I did not find it so bad and while time consuming I had blocked out my chemo day to allow for it, in all I was in the hospital for about 5 hours.  I'm on day ten after FEC now and watching it closely as do not know what will happen but I am going to persevere at the moment. Was told not to wash hair for 48 hours before or after and then treat gently with paraben free shampoo. Good luck with your Fec next week.  Susie x",

      "Content": "Hello Andrew You are amazing and it sounds like it is very tough for you both physically and emotionally. As the other ladies say, have you got all the support you can from Macmillan? And also have you a local cancer centre you can access to give you a little help if you need it. Since my diagnoses I have been going to a local cancer centre for lots of free complimentary therapies and counselling and my partner is also able to access these for free as well. He has not done so far, but they are there if he needs to.  I am in Surrey but there are lots of centres around the country and the Mac nurses or hospitals usually know where.  It's very difficult to see someone you love in pain and not always be able to help, from someone currently going through treatment and having been in pain, just knowing my partner is there helps. I sometimes can't give him more support and emotion at times, especially when I am just trying to get through the day, but just a hug all round reassures us both. It's tough and it's horrible but we know we are there for each other as does your wife for you. With your long working week and looking after your wife I know you probably have very little time for you, and you have chosen to give that time in selflessness to your wife, but as you say its now getting difficult to cope, maybe just an hour a week of support for you could help you both. It's hard to see when you are in such a difficult situation but a little step back can be beneficial. Just something for you to think about and work out again what you can and want to control. I wish you all the best, you are doing so well, just look after you too.  ",

Then got upset tum on session two, but again meds for that and was fine. Session 3 apart from tiredness and a worse mouth fine again. To be honest, for me all manageable.  I prepared for worse and hoped for best and its been OK. Also been OK emotionally but wobbled before session two and after number 3. Was very much, can't do this but you do. So prepare, drink lots, sip if you have to, and eat little and often and you may find hopefully not to bad. Did a Look Good Feel Better workshop in week, brilliant', what a confidence boost. All my friends said I looked ten years younger, great for halfway through chemo. Recommended for anyone. Had to go out in eve so as not to waste the make over. Try one in your local area if you get  but fed up half way through. My first session.

      "Content": "Hi Diabbot It's natural to feel angry, upset, stressed, up and down. Just had 4 of my 6 chemo's and wish life was more balanced as I never know what the next day is going to bring. Woke up this morning feeling ok after two days in  bed and managed to get out for a couple of hours, felt emotionally stronger today. This afternoon, no energy, back on the bed and could cry for England. But what I do know is that the counselling I started at the beginning of my chemo has really helped. I have had an opportunity to throw out there each week anything that is worrying me and to examine my own reactions which has made a difficult situation at home much more balanced. My partner (21 years) also not keen on talking has been anxious when I have come home on a couple of occasions and asked questions, especially in our down spots, like did she tell you to leave me? and, what did she say? I pointed out to him that she is not there to tell me what to do but for me to explore how I feel about things and how I react to things. The latter was so much use as we have looked at how I react as well as how he might react and sometimes I have adjusted how i deal with some situations. And now have been able to say again 'this is how I feel' when my confidence has dipped. Your husband has been looking after you and may just be a little anxious that he feels you are looking to someone else for support and not be able to express this.There is always a fear for everyone that this changes things, and in many ways it does, and it could. But if your marriage is strong am sure the counselling will help you get through a difficult time and remain stronger for the future. ",

I am 8 months past chemo now and it was a good six months before everything stopped aching and 6 months after radio before I got any level of energy back. I've just been to a 50th birthday bash and was amazed I stayed up to 4am!! No way on that one a couple months ago. I feel pretty much okay now and have just had first year mammogram which was clear. I am having a CT scan in August but only because I had a rare presentation of my cancer, it was not offered but I insisted and they only gave in because of the initial circumstances. . Hopefully all will be all well at that point in time and I feel I will then be able to move on emotionally as well as physically. I am really starting to feel more like the old me, with a few changes!! I do get really achy days, and am still trying to lose weight but do feel so much better than even two months ago. I'm also doing yoga at my local cancer centre and its great, it's much more gentle than my usual; mainstream class or Pilates but does work for me. Take care. xxx",

But I do remember being like you very anxious at the outset and quite manic about doing everything right. I have just had last chemo and am a little more relaxed although was important to keep it up. I made the hubby clean the cat litter trays though, and he's still doing it, which is great, my very old cat of twenty years uses it about ten times a day, so I think the hubby can carry on with that one for sure!! I was very manic about my oral hygiene also and managed to keep most ulcers and thrush at bay. I brushed after most meals which I found helped with taste as well as keeping my mouth spotless. I did read you should change your toothbrush or head after each chemo but I used to clean mine in Milton Sterilising fluid once a week as had a toothbrush in each bathroom. I did however change the electric heads after FEC and before moving on to T. Now that done am going to change them again before getting back into my normal routine. Funnily enough my Dietician (London Cancer Hospital) said not to worry about pregnant women's diet as long as food is from a reliable source, but to have no take-away, including Fish and Chips. However, makes sense to me not to have eaten runny eggs and runny cheese etc. so I did avoid things like that and make sure everything was well cooked. I ended up in hospital after my first T and the only thing they could pin it on was my facial Rosacea Acne, although not even then for sure. Just appeared to be one of those things. So hopefully and with good hygiene you will be fine. And on the plus, as there is always one, you should see my skin now, perfect, 58 going on twenty with all the compliments I keep getting about it!! Good luck with the FEC and let us know how goes.

Many people do not get anything at all. I had 30 sessions of radio and was fine until day 18 when I did start to get some slight skin changes, then by day 23 I did have some blisters followed by a little bit of broken skin in two/three places. However, they kept a daily eye on things and around day 23 gave me something called Medi-Honey which was nothing short of miraculous for me, 48 hours later everything had cleared and I was able to finish my sessions. The skin was also very odd in that it did not feel burnt it more felt itchy so never needed painkillers at all. Not sure how many sessions you will be having but from my experience I would not really have even got this if my sessions had been 15 in number which is slightly more standard these days. Good luck, look after your skin and keep an eye on things and hopefully you will be fine. x",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona Had lymph node clearance without breast surgery and found it okay. The operation was about one hour and I went home later in day with one drain. The nurse came for next three days to check wound, about 4 inches long, and removed drain three days later. Mine was pretty clean and did not get any seromas although needed antibiotics in seven week as got a wound infection from dressing. It did feel odd and uncomfortable with numbness and tingling in arm which went on for several months. I was given a heart shaped cushion after op which helped keep my arm away from side which helped with pain and getting air to area.  One thing I did find was no real support for lymphodema which I now have. I kept saying to BCN after about 6 weeks I am getting it to be told its the swelling from op. 4 months later finally got rwfferal to clinic, and guess what. It's still mild but I strongly believe not enough is fine up front. I read one in four women with full clearance get it, then one in two who have radio which I am now in midst off. Mine was in all lymph nodes as seen on several scans as I have Occult BC with no apparent tumour in breast so no choice on clearance. But as dreamtheuf says recommended full clear depending on cancer type and cells. So do discuss and understand further with onc xx",

I also could not walk my feet were so sore And like you I found myself many times saying I cannot go on and in tears. I think its natural to feel up and down, we can't feel positive all the time. It did pass though, usually for me after I had stopped the steroids and the injections and had a pill free 10 days or so before next treatment  Def speak to the oncologist though, as my dose was changed after chemo four, and I did not have such a severe reaction for the next T. Hang on in there, it does pass, and it is killing nasties, but your oncologist can tell you if you are having more of a severe reaction than normal and help with does/symptoms. ",

If I got a little ulcer I used the gel and rubbed it on directly which seemed to do the trick. After each FEC it improved after about 7 days but after each T it lasted for a bit longer and did seem to be a bit cumulative. I did have to experiment with lots of different things but also found if Lemon Barley, for example, was okay one week I could not taste it the next.  I did find strong flavour boiled sweets helped but again its trial and error I am afraid. Good luck with it and if mouth deteriorates and you need something stronger talk to your BCN. x",

I did have an intravenous Ondansetron before my chemo in the morning than a tablet of the same last thing at night, before Domperidone 3 times a day for the first three days so perhaps this does need changing.  I think the good news is hearing that it will go away eventually and not last nearly the whole cycle!! What a relief.  Going for a walk and shopping shortly as sun is out today. Good luck with second FEC on Tuesday Smoothie, let me know how goes and I will let my guys know how mine went with first time around so they can change meds as needed.  Good luck with house too, managed to get my all done for first chemo last week and plan on doing this each cycle so one less thing to worry about.  Susie xxxx",

I found that I was very anxious until my pre-chemo chat and that settled me down lots as it gave All of them pretty manageable and lots help if needed. After that I did not worry so much about the actual day itself. On the day, it all went  very fast, even with trying out the cold cap, and I felt relieved it was starting.  I have been lucky and not had too many side effects but I did have a fuzzy head for about a week, and did have some low level forgetfulness but it did not stop me functioning, and cleared after a week. The cancer research page gives you tips on how to deal with it and help to seek if you think this may be affecting you. But try to think about how it does not affect a bigger % of people than it does. http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/cancer-questions/chemo-brain We all react differently so take all the advice and support and prepare as much as possible for the day and hopefully it won't be as bad as expected. When you have had your treatment can your ring any friend just for a reassuring chat if you feel isolated? or ring your BC nurse if you are not sure about anything.  I was given a 24 hour number to call at my pre-chemo talk and this was helpful as it made me feel I could call if I had questions. You can also come on here and you can drop me a friend request and have a chat this way if you would like.  I have my 2nd FEC on 3rd September also and am sure I will get anxious but will be with everyone, including yourself, in spirit. Meantime, if you can do some things you like and distract yourself , do try to. Easier said than done I know but be kind and treat yourself .it may help. Take care and keep in touch. Susie x",

I have already had all my right lymph nodes removed which did have disease, but despite every scan known to man the primary source has not been found, although I am told it is breast from all the pathology and that this is called 'occult'.  All the scans, bone, CT, MRI (2), PET, endless mammograms, have shown nothing else so far but this is the scary bit, in that I have been told what I have is high risk so it always feels it is lurking somewhere.  Anyone else had this scenario?  Anyhow, want to get the chemo started so will be checking in on this thread and am sure will have questions as the weeks progress.  Susie. x",

Got home, had lunch felt fine, caught up with all the best wishes messages and then got hit with sickness and exhaustion around 5pm.  Could not drink water or keep anything down despite having had an intravenous anti-sickness med before the FEC.  Slunk into bed about 09.30 with a ginger biscuit and some Lemon Barley, which did help, but had a sleepless night so pretty tired today. However, I am pleased to report that the sickness has now mostly abated, on some tablets for it today, and while I am still tired all I really now have is a slightly fuzzy head. I had intended to go to work (part-time) but felt a bit too shaky to drive so am doing a few bits and pieces at home instead. I have six days of injections starting tomorrow to help with infection and am told may get bone pain with those, but am sure I will be a bit more 'realistic' from this point on. But as you say Jediknight, we can do it. And now I've got some idea what it might be like for me next time I can hopefully plan around it xxx",

      "Content": "Thanks Jediknight, for your advice and kind words. Just back from first FEC and so far so good apart from nausea which keeps coming over me in waves but which is manageable at the moment.  I am prone to all sorts sickness at the drop of a hat so had an intravenous med and have some more meds to take later and over next few days so kinda expected this bit might get me.  Will call them if does not settle Hope all was okay with starting your session JakeB. I will report on how goes and am prepared from all the great advice on here, although hoping for the best.  Got six injections to start Sat for the White Blood cells and poss infections so hoping that passes me by. Squeamish though so partner going to have to do them.  He painted my toes and nails at chemo this morning, brilliant if not the best job, so being extra kind to him today as well!! Also had the cold cap and now look like a scarecrow but really found it no problem at all, in fact kept on at them about it was not very cold and was it tight enough etc.  They probably thought I was very odd especially as general consensus was it was freezing.  We will see what happens next.  Good luck for your 3rd T tomorrow, it is daunting but I now feel 1 down 5 to go, and know that it will soon be 5 down, 1 to go, and great to know however rubbish a few days are it will pass.  Take care.

      "Content": "Hi Lizzy, I have the same problem and was given the same advice by my chemo nurse.  However, he also gave me a NHS leaflet from my local  health authority on Oral Care that says electric is fine with a soft head so I have gone back to using that also. It's been fine so far as I am taking it gently and have no sign of mouth ulcers yet although first chemo was only last week so not getting too excited yet!!. The leaflet also says clean softly 4 times a day which I have now started doing, and suggests a  TePe silk brush or back to baby brush, or even fingers, if gets too sore. It also says if you do get ulcers change the toothbrush each chemo cycle which seems to make sense to me. Interestingly it says there is no clinical benefit in mouthwash and water is just as good but if you do use mouthwash then it should be alcohol free. I'm using Corsodyl Gel on my gums after rinsing with water in hope keeping them a little more resilient at the moment. And of course, all this assumes its not getting to bad and does not need something on prescription like Difflam at some point. Anyhow, I think its fine, and the first sign I see of any soreness on gums etc, I will back off a little. xx",

I cant' believe how quickly I went back to work either as it wiped me out but I feel fine now.  I also went in to work for three hours yesterday and did not get tired this time.  I have just completed six of the injections for the white blood cells and did not find them too bad, although after one my wrist went into spasm and I had the most excruciating pan but only lasted half an hour thankfully.  I also had a weird experience with a giant (partner says small but felt giant) yellow ulcer on the end of my tongue on day 6, did all I was supposed to do with cleaning rinsing etc. woke up next day and it was gone. Tastebuds back to 'normal'ish' but love fish and the mere mention of word sets me off so won't be eating that for a while.  bacon sounds good though, get a big stock. Today I have visitors and if it were not for a running nose would not even feel like had the FEC.  I am going to prepare for next one on 3rd Sept in same way as, you say, I think it may not help if we take our eye of the ball.  But easy to do, as I feel so fine, I'm what me?, and am then in constant fear that it will all come crashing down on me sometime soon. I also worry from the other angle, that if I do not feel too bad is it doing me any good? especially as I know that all my affected lymph nodes were not able to be removed from my armpit, although no sign anywhere else and did have about 7 scans, including a PET, in total..  But hey, sun is shining, I have visitors shortly and will take today as it is. Look forward to hearing you are all settled and have some space before next one and wish everyone a lovely weekend. Susie xx",

I usually lost 2/3 kilos on FEC and about 7 Kilos after each FEC, which in one sense would have been great!! if stayed off but never did, as soon as appetite came back it went straight back on. The only thing is that SW is very low fat and you do need a level of good fats to help other nutrients be absorbed into your body so try not to cut this food group out too much. I found when on SW if I used Olive Oil, one tablespoon a day, the I was having my good fats and still having nice dressings and cooking veg with it. The six sins was then worth it. xx",

A dodgy few days after chemo then a complete surprise in week 2 at how much energy I had, followed by low energy again this week, guess that's how it goes, not 100% predictable. But coming on here and knowing it can be like that is comforting.  My FEC 2 is Thursday and even though I know what to expect in terms process I am starting to get a little down at the thought of it. However, at least Friday it will be two down four to go.  In fact, can't believe how fast these last three weeks have gone. I'm doing cold cap and started to shed a bit of hair over the last few days but not to much at the moment. I was told it will go within a week or so of FEC2 if it does not work but am still persevering with that at the moment. Think I'm slightly in denial that it might happen as have not even got a wig yet, so can imagine having to rush out and get one next week. I'm sure we will all look great just getting over that initial step and the thought of it being worse than is.  A friend of mone was diagnosed day after me and she has two new wigs, and they are so fab, could not even tell one was not her pre chemo hair when she sent me a pciture. Take care ladies, year flying by so am sure weill see you on the Sept Chemo club shortly. Hope all goes well with next FEC. Susie x ",

They are very gentle. You can then have full on Manual Lymph Drainage massages if needed with someone who is qualified to do these on people with Lymphoedema. Only problem with the MLD part is that it is expensive, and not supported by NHS unless you are classified as having a severe problem. Catching it or stopping it early is the key, my NHS trust won't see anyone unless there is already a noticeable problem and every time I said I had one I was told no its just the op. Eventually kicked up enough fuss and got seen for advice and treatment. The exercises have helped lots.",

I am finding this site and the support really helpful and an taking all the advice I am given to see if it works for me. I'm preparing and planning and if don't need it then great.  I was a little nauseous for two days after my chemo and struggled with water,so on advice I added Lemon Barley and Ginger and Lemon Presse to the water and it worked. Also ate cherries and almonds, little and often, which for some reason worked for me when appetite faded, glad to say its back today. Went for a walk today for about an hour to see Battle of Britain Flypast and while a bit tired now, was really pleased to really feel up to it. Had ice cream and first cup tea since Thursday so if keeps on like this I will be pleased.  Aim for the Superbikes, look after yourself for a few days and am sure you will make it.  xxx",

I for one am a talker but having finished active Treatment I am looking forward to not every conversation starting with me. The usual 'how are you' has seemed to turn into a reiteration numerous times for me over the last year, lol. Guess if I meet people now I may not share it, not at all ashamed, just perhaps not relevant to conversation. Although if comes up comes up. But I will look forward to exposing my radical new haircut soon for those who do not realise I have a wig, that should be interesting. Xx",

I won't say try not to worry because you will, but you have coped so far and you will find the strength from somewhere again. Just see if you can find something for you to do to distract yourself from this feelings firca while. Failing that punch a cushion scream and shout about how rubbish some if this is. Then dyst yourself down and face the day. Those that love you will know you are anxious and upset and won't love you any the less for cranky days. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Shellie Whatever you do, do get that second opinion, and make sure that all is well. Hopefully it will be but you do need a full and proper explanation for your symptoms and one that will help put your mind at rest. I have never had any lumps in my breast at all and was having regular mammograms. My first symptom was a swelling under the armpit and I had to go back several times before they took it seriously and found a lump in my sentinel lymph node that was diagnosed as breast cancer. From that point I had numerous scans to find the source, CT, MRI and PET, but its never been found. I have had lymph nodes out, chemotherapy, and just started radio today, I do not think having to go back several times made a huge difference to my eventual prognosis but I did need to keep going back till I was satisfied.  It was also very confusing as in how do you know its breast if you cannot find a lump, but I pushed until I understood (to a degree) what they were telling me and why they could be reasonably confident it was breast XXX",

She was kept on it for six months by her Onc to give it time but it did not settle so he took her off to see how it went, and withing about six weeks most aches and pains had gone. Due to her pathology and low risk she has not been put on anything else at the moment but is still having Herceptin injections. x",
