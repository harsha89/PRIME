Talking on here has helped me lost, always someone to give advice. Have you tired ringing your macmillan nurse,when ever i speak to mine they are amazing, no rushing to get you off the phone and lots of listening and advice about things. Maybe give them a go. But also feel free to rant, cry and celebrate with us all xx Big Hugs for you xxx",

I very much doubt it or she wouldn\u2019t speak to you the way she has.  I had a few times when I thought I couldn\u2019t do it any more and even at one point told my kids that I wasn\u2019t going to carry on with my chemo. So don\u2019t be too hard on yourself we\u2019ve all felt like you feel at some point in our treatment.  Try not to think about it over the weekend, get plenty of rest and do something you love doing xxx ",

When she asked what did you use to do you should have told her you was a belly dancer, and watched the look on her face. Is there anything we can do to help? Apart from me organising a mini bus to pick a few of us up to come with you next time?  In time all this will be a distant memory, although that doesn't help when you are stuck in the middle of it. You have done so well so far and you will continue to do so.  Have you had chance to speak to your oncologist? I was neutropenic after my first docetaxel and they thought i had sepsis but luckily i didn't. But when i spoke to my oncologist he lowered the dose of my remaining treatments and i was ok then, i also put myself into isolation the week after treatment to avoid any bugs being brought into the house. Keep talking to us. we will help you get through this xxx lots of love xxx",

She also said to do them just before bed so if there were any aches and pains i would sleep through them. I worried about doing the injections but not once did they hurt, whether this is because of the large amount of fat i have to inject into whoops!!! but they were lots easier than i thought. I also never missed any chemo treatments either even after i'd been into hospital after my 3rd with no blood count at all it was built back up in time for my 4th treatment.",

Also at any time if you need advice ring the emergency number you will have been given, do not think that they will automatically send you to hospital because they don't but can give advice to make it easier. Plus don't forget we're here for advice and support xx good luck xx Daisydoo38 How poopy that you had to spend a night in hotel NHS Hope the SEs are easing now and you're feeling better. Hopefully they will sort your medication out so it won't happen next time. couttleberry good to see you, i found i got more and more tired as treatment went on, remind yourself what the chemo is doing, it might be the devil in disguise but in time it will help to make you better. I had 3x docetaxel and felt the same as you when i switched from FEC to Docetaxel, so anything that is worrying you give me a shout, either on here or send me a message. I did find myself more tired but NO sickness or nausea. Sorry cant help with fitting you a cooker before christmas or fix your roof so hopefully someone who knows what they're doing will sort that for you.  Good to know your getting use to no hair, mine started growing back after my second docetaxel and its amazing how fast it grows, still not enough to go out without a hat but i won't be long before i can. As for regulating body temperature hat on cos i'm cold, hat off because i'm melting, hat back on because i'm cold, its a vicious circle and don't even mention the night sweats, cover on, covers off lol  Karen 234 We will have none of that you have failed!!! (i have my mummy voice on can you tell) you have completed what is necessary and it was the professionals who said you didn't need it anymore and not you saying you didn't want it. You're not the first and won't be the last to to have treatment shortened. So we'll have a Congratulations and well done on completing your chemotherapy  Birdsoafeather Well done on hitting the half way mark. Have you thought of having ice lollies when struggling with drinking?? i also these were nice when taste buds had decided to take a holiday lol i finished my chemo 6 weeks ago today, i had 3 x docetaxel so anything you want to know give me a shout. Hello Kpr2018 Hope you're first appointment went ok and you got lots of questions answered. Worrying is natural we've all been there but ask here if there is anything you think we can help you with. No question is a silly one. I've been where you are i am now 6 weeks on from the end of my chemotherapy and it worked a treat, i was originally told the aim of the chemo was to shrink the 6cm tumor, i had an MRI and was told last week that NO cancer cells are showing so it was worth every minute. So give me a shout if there is anything i can help you with. Remember you are all amazing, even when you feel you aren't xxx",

Although it was falling out it didn't look too bad, but the day after my second chemotherapy i washed my hair and the bottom of the bath was covered, i wrapped my head in a towel and rung my sister in floods of tears asking her if she'd come and take the towel off my head. She did and it had all fallen out at the top but i still had quite a bit around the back, i looked like a monk, i still hung onto it until 5 days after my 2nd FEC why?? i have no idea, and i was a cow bag to everyone. So on the Sunday after my second treatment my sister came and shaved my head with the clippers on a number one, with the guard on to make sure it didn't cut my head. The relief was unbelievable, i wish i'd done it sooner instead of putting myself through the waiting for the inevitable. My hair started growing back after my 5th treatment (docetaxel) and now 4 weeks after chemo has finished i have about 2cm of hair. Funny i have got use to not having any, and the quick showers are brill, shower before bed without having to dry your hair. I didn't actually lose all my hair always had a strip along the back that didn't fall out, also i haven't lost all of my eye brows or eye lashes but there aren't many left. AnnJac i'm so glad you're finally feeling better, enjoy the time you sure do deserve it. Hope everyone is doing ok and coping well,",

You will surprise yourself and you will cope, probably really well, you are so much stronger than you know. We all have bad days, and are allowed but you will have good days too. Make sure you ask lots of questions when you see your breast care nurse and oncologist. No question is a silly question and if you forget to ask them then post on here.

I wasn't assigned a breast cancer nurse i was just given the number of the breast care clinic and one of the nurses ring me back. They are all amazing and never make you feel like you are pestering or wasting their time. I don't know about your hospital but my breast care nurse is different to my oncology nurse, i have been able to ring my breast care nurse from the start where as my oncology nurse i only rung while having chemotherapy. I know it's scary but try not to be, it really isn't as scary as you think and when you've had your first chemo on Tuesday you'll think, is that it. We'll all be here waiting to hear how its gone and ready to support you in whichever way we can. If you think of any questions write them down and take them with you so you don't forget what to ask.

The thing you need to keep a check on with docetaxel is your immune system, it kicked mine down big time. So make sure you take your temperature regularly. I use to wake up and often felt dizzy i wondered if this was low blood sugar so had real sugar (rather than sweetener) on my cereal and it seemed to work. It made me feel a lot more tired and exhausted than FEC ever did. Be careful with paracetamol that it doesn't hide the symptoms if you have got any kind of infection. I had no sickness with docetaxel just felt tired most of the time, no taste buds and my nails started lifting from my nail bed (but i haven't heard the nail thing happening to many people)  I have finished my chemo now and finally started having a bit more energy and my tastebuds are back to normal :O) ",

I was a bit luckier than you as i only had 3 FEC so after i'd had 2 in my right arm i had the rest of my chemo into my left arm 1 x FEC 3 X Docetaxel so didn't have the same problem with my left. Speak to your chemo nurse see if they can do anything for you. I was given some cream called Hirudoid cream to rub onto the affects vein which eased it plus i found an cold wheat bag helped too. You can visibly see the vein in my right arm now, it doesn't hurt at all anymore and no longer pulls but you can see where it is and feel it under the skin. I was told FEC can harden your veins and i'm guessing this is what happened. There are lots of people on here who have had a PICC line in i'm sure they'll be along soon, maybe worth a try as i've been told its lots easier than having a cannula every time. And NEVER apologise for moaning, we all do it and thats what we're here for xxxx",

I've been in hospital twice now and both times i left my mobile phone in my suitcase in my room, and it was still there when i came back. In fact yesterday the nurse went into my suitcase to get me it out when i got back to my room. Also like someone else has mentioned i went down to theatre in my dressing gown, slippers and glasses. These were put in a bag with my name on and were in my room with me when i woke up. So maybe if you don't want to leave valuables in your room you could put them in your dressing gown pocket and they would be kept with you. I was also told that if i wanted my mobile locked up to ask a nurse and they would lock it in the medical cabinet and keep it safe until i got back, so lots of options. ",

All i can say is the start is terrifying and totally overwhelming, but i found once i knew what treatment i was having and it started i felt so less scared. You will surprise yourself and you will cope, probably really well, you are so much stronger than you know. We all have bad days, and are allowed but you will have good days too. Make sure you ask lots of questions when you see your breast care nurse and oncologist. No question is a silly question and if you forget to ask them then post on here. This place is amazing for easing your worries and concerns, and making bad days not so bad.  Big hugs to you both xx",

I know you are on your own but to be honest people who haven't had cancer themselves don't always get you anyway. It can be very lonely but coming here talking to people who have been, are going through or starting treatment the same as you really really helps. I live on my own with my grown up son, i have had times where i've felt so alone but come on here for an hour or so and don't feel so lonely anymore. Don't worry about coming and ranting, moaning, crying we've all been there and no one judges anyone.Meetups are also arranged all over the country so in no time you'll make some new friends. I live in Yorkshire and i now have a good friend who i met through here who lives in Barcelona. We text each other often and when i was going through the hardest part of my treatment she was there for me, i plan on going to visit her in May. We are all here for you, if you're having chemotherapy Leolady56 starts a new post every month which is fantastic because people can go through it together. And in time you'll go from the lady who is asking for advice to the lady who is giving advice. It feels amazing knowing you're helping others. Big Hugs for you, And don't forget we are all here for you. ",

Once the lumpectomy is over with and you have recovered then concentrate on your chemotherapy, but only one treatment at a time.

They can tell you what to expect and how to deal with the SEs etc. How old are your children? My godson who is 2 has dealt with Auntie Shelley losing her hair really well, we told him that the medicine that was going to make me better makes my hair fall out, but it doesn't matter because it will grow back. They will get use to mum with no hair. And you'll get use to it too. Before i lost my hair it was the worse thing that could happen. Once it had gone it was such a big relief and now it doesn't really bother my much at all. Believe it or not most of the time you will LOOK well, in fact if you're like me you'll get fed up of people telling you how well you look.

Can i also say that my cancer was triple negative and not hormonal like yours. I had a lumpectomy in January and when the results came back i didn't have clear margins, there was a 1mm cancer showing and a DCIS. I was told i could have another lumpectomy or go straight for a mastectomy. After hours of wondering what was best, i decided to go for another lumpectomy. I was absolutely devastated when i again didn't get clear margins. They found another 5mm and more DCIS. Within 2 weeks i was in having a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I am 6 weeks past that now and last week was given the all clear. When i think back i'm not sure i would have done it any different because if i could have kept my original boob it would have been worth it. The only thing i feel i have lost is time getting rid of it.  Results after my mastectomy were it was the best thing because they found more cancer, more DCIS and a lymph node with cancer in it which now have all gone.  But please remember we are all different and all treatments work differently for different people. You need to decide whats best for you, not anyone else and once you've made that decision remember it was the best one. Please talk to me if i can help with any questions at all.",

I was told that if my second would have been successful my surgeon would have used the fat just under my boobs, my middle tyre, to fill in the space left from the lumpectomy.  I had an immediate reconstruction after my mastectomy using the muscle from my back. One of my biggest fears was to wake up with a boob missing, silly when you think all we have been through but thats just how i felt. Straight after the mastectomy my boob didn't hurt at all, they cut through the nerves so its a bit numb. I did have a bit of pain in my back from where they had taken the muscle but it wasn't anything that wasn't solved with pain killers. It felt more stiff, someone described it to me as if you have a broom handle fastened to your back, you want to bend but you can't not for the couple weeks anyway. The drain was more of a nuisance than anything else. I'm happy with the results although my new boob is smaller than my old boob but this isn't noticeable when i'm dressed. I go back and see my consultant again in November to discuss making them even. ",

So i was asked if i wanted another lumpectomy or a mastectomy. It hit my like ton of bricks, if anything it hit me harder than finding out it had the cancer to start with.

I'm not saying your GP doesn't know what they are talking about but maybe if you speak to the people who specialise in chemo they might know better. The breast care nurses are there for you all the time so they won't mind you worrying, and might be able to advise the best action to take. I wasn't physically sick with EC but felt terribly sick, i found that if i didn't eat the sicky feeling was worse. I found eating little but often even if i wasn't hungry helped.

Then they lifted from the nailbed, it felt like they were all going to fall off so for about 2 weeks i walked about with plasters wrapped around my finger ends. I had shellac on at the time so couldnt see what was happening but i could feel it, they felt tender but again the plasters helped. Once i took the shellac off i could see where the nail had lifted from,  None actually fell off and eventually grew out, i can't have shellac on at the minute due to being in and out of hospital for lumpectomy etc so not had any put back on, my nails are a bit flaky and brittle but i think once i can have shellac on again they'll be fine and stop breaking. I found the side i had the most chemo in was affected more than the other. Now my big toe is a totally different story, no others just my big toe on my right foot, 4 months post chemo and i am waiting for it to drop off, hopefully it won't and it will just grow out like my finger nails.",

I can't really help with how to stop worrying, i still haven't got the all clear from my first cancer and already worry about it coming back.  Have you thought of some kind of counselling? i know MacMillan do it and i'm sure your doctor would refer you if you went and spoke to them. I've had counselling in the past (not cancer related) and it worked. They help you to look at things in a different way.  We have to try and live our lives and not let this stupid bloody illness take over but its so much easier said than done. I also think that unless you've been through it yourself, no one, no matter how much you talk to them will ever understand. I know i didn't understand until i got it myself.

Maybe give her a ring if you think it will help, they're lovely and more than happy to help. Also ask away on here, you can do this and you will because one thing we all have is inner strength that we never knew we had.  Make sure you talk to us, rant, cry, moan and we sometimes have a laugh. No question is a silly one,believe me i asked a few i thought were silly but turned out they weren't.

After my second FEC the vein i had the chemo into became really sore,felt like it was bruised and it went right up my arm. The only way i could describe it was that my vein pulled if i tried to straighten my arm, this started the second week after treatment. When i held my arm straight you could see the vein through my skin all the way up my arm, The vein looked dark and felt really tight. I ended up in hospital with an infection, not related to the vein, but i mentioned it to the doctor and he said that the chemo i was having could irritate the veins. It wore off after a week but when i had my 3rd treatment (i asked for it in my left hand due to the pain in my right last time) the second week my right hand and arm felt sore again. I took it that its because the vein is already irritated so when i had the chemo again and it got round to the vein it caused more irritation. Its still sore and i have my 4th chemo on Tuesday. When i straighten my arm the vein becomes tight and i can see where it is under my skin. They did give me cream to ease the bruising pain but i found a cold rice bag helped the most.",

Not one any of us would have chosen but in the circumstances its the best place to be. Its an amazing place full of support and advice. Wow!!! You have been in a bit of a whirlwind, not even a week to wait for your op, thats fast. Which op did you have? Was it a lumpectomy or a mastectomy? Was you given exercises to do after your op? I know i was with both my lumpectomy and my mastectomy. They are to prevent your arm and shoulder getting stiff. If you have make sure you do them they really work. If you haven't then ring your breast care nurse and tell her you haven't been given any exercises to do. 2-3 weeks seems about right for the wait for results, i know i waited for 4 weeks for some of mine.  Please have a look around and ask any questions you may need the answers to, there are lots of us around to show you the ropes, offer advice and give you all the support you need. Take it easy remember you have had surgery even if you feel well, look after yourself.",

I am just waiting to hear the results from my MRI to see how much ass kicking my chemo has done, then i'll see the surgeon who will tell me what op i will be having.  And how can i not say well done you on kicking it well and truly up the bum, i can't wait for the day they tell me i'm all clear.",

I trimmed them as low as i could and after around a week they didn't feel so bad. It is just starting to happen again after my last treatment so going to plaster them up again. Don't think they'll actually fall off although they felt like they would, so maybe keep strapping your toe nail up and it will be ok.",

I spent 5 days in hospital but this was because they wanted to be sure there was no problems with the skin and muscle. I wasn't allowed to lift my arm above my shoulder for 4 weeks and this week started exercises to get muscles working again. I am back driving and doing things i did before, although being cautious until i know what i can do. Had hardly any pain more of an ache, which was easily resolved with ibuprofen or paracetamol. The reason i chose a reconstruction with my back muscles was because they don't actually disconnect the blood vessels from your body they just move the muscle round to the front.",

This place is fantastic for support and advice. I know because the lovely people here got me through the last year and continue to do so even though i now have the all clear. I think everyone struggles when they first get told, after all its not something any of us expect to happen. Just know we have all been where you are now. Everyone struggles but i found once i go chatting to people who \"Got Me\" because they were or had been through the same it made it easier. Read my profile and see that i had some DCIS but now they are gone, i am now cancer free and you will be too. My advice is take each step at a time, write down any questions you have and take them to appointments, because if you're like me the minute you get in there your mind will go blank. You will also be given a breast care nurse, most of them are worth their weight in gold and will be there for you throughout and long after all this. So use them, ring if you are unsure about anything or want any answers. Coming here you will meet people who have been or are going through what you are, and before you know it you'll be the ones giving advice to others. Like Leolady56 said, no question is a silly one, believe me i've asked some in my time here but there is always someone who comes along and understands or has been through the same.  Don't put yourself under too much pressure, its ok to have days you feel poopy but don't let them out weight the days you feel strong and you've got this sorted. Once  you have a treatment plan and understand what is going to happen you'll feel better and more in control.  We'll be beside you every step of the way climbing that mountain don't you worry and we'll be there cheering you on when you reach the top. Keep talking to us ladies xxx",

      "Content": "Hiya Optimistic thanks for your response. Would you believe that since i wrote this a neighbour called to show me her new grandson and she told me about her Aunt who had her reconstruction done with her back muscle. She said it was amazing and that you can't tell the difference at all. So fingers crossed. To answer your question, the reason i chose this one over the others was: 1. A implant will stay the same whatever. So if i lose weight my own boob will get smaller but the implant will stay the same size, same if i put on weight. So ruled that one out.  2. With a diep the tissue is disconnected from the body, the blood vessels are then reattached through micro surgery. This can sometimes cause complications due to the small vessels.The wound to remove the tissue is normally bigger than the wound to move the tissue in a latissimus dorsi flap procedure (using back muscle) so will take longer to heal.  3. In a latissimus dorsi flap procedure, the muscle/fat is not disconnected from the body so no problems reconnecting blood supply as it never disconnected. 4. The scar on your back is hidden by your bra and not as big as with a diep. 5. It looks more natural than an implant. The only negative is i have been told i will have some weakness in my arm, but as it is my left side and i am right handed i can't see it causing me much problem. I'll let you know how it goes xx",

I was told it would become weak but hoping after doing exercises it will be better. Optimistic i won't need an implant, my surgeon told me if my boobs didn't match they could reduce my other in the future if necessary.

I was told they are put there so if my chemotherapy got rid of the tumors all together then they knew where to look. I have also been told they take these clips out during surgery and look at them under a microscope to get a closer look to make sure all the cancer has gone. It reduces the risk of it returning. I had a male friend who was quite concerned when i told him then said i was going for an MRI scan i think he thought my boob might explode lol",

At the end of the day they are there to make you better, so try not to worry too much, i know its easier said than done.  My lump was 6cm when i was first diagnosed with some lymph nodes involved. I was lucky though never had any pain, in fact i didn't even know it was there. As for the pain have you tired a hot water bottle, i find sometimes heat works. Don't have it too hot though you don't want to be burning yourself.  Keep talking to us and i hope you have as good a day as you possibly can xx",

The waiting is the worse part of all of this poopiness as your mind takes over and always thinks of the worse case scenario. The aches and pains everywhere, you will find lots of us had them and continue to do so. I even got that when i had a headache i was asking, is it more painful than normal, has it lasted longer than usual. I felt the same as you, i walked into the clinic thinking i was perfectly healthy to be told i had breast cancer, but How?? I don't feel poorly, but thats how sneaky the little b***er is.  Don't struggle, talk to us, thats what we are here for, i have been here since the day i found out and the place has offered me so much support its amazing. You might think but they're only people online but they have got me through some of my hardest day and i have shared my best days with them too. Before you know it you're giving out advice too and that feels just if not even more amazing knowing you have helped someone else. As for the replying, if you click reply it just adds your post to the bottom. You can tag people which will then highlight their name and notify them that someone has sent a reply to them. To do that you type @ then start typing their name, it will appear in a drop down thing and click on their name and it will show.  You'll be an expert in no time, keep talking to us, big hugs for you xxx",

Don't worry about what you eat, just eat what you fancy. I lived on Chicken soup and cheesy garlic bread lol then on the last week i use to make up for it.  One bit of advice i would give you is, eat little and often even if you don't feel hungry.

I had a lumpectomy at the beginning of January but before that had already completed 18 weeks of chemo, i didn't get clear margins so have had a further lumpectomy on the hope to get clear margins this time. If i do i will then go onto having a partial reconstruction (wouldn't have needed one if my first lumpectomy had been clear) followed by 15 radiotherapy treatments. But please remember everyone is different and everyone has different treatment plans. Have you thought of ringing your breast care nurse and asking her what the options are next. Mine have always been honest and helped when i have had questions i've needed answering. Good Luck on Monday, i was pleasantly surprised how easy the lumpectomy was, was sick due to the anesthetic the first op but was sent home same day with my second.  Please give me a shout of you think i can help at all xxx",

Did you have your docetaxel first then your FEC?? I've done my 3 FEC and have my first of 3 docetaxel on Tuesday, any handy hints for the docetaxel? i will be finishing my chemo beginning of November.

Mine was stage 3 too, and hadn't spread to anywhere else, it was just one tumor in my boob and a trace in my lymph nodes.

The main side effects for me were feeling sick, but once you get use to when to take the anti sickness tablets you soon have it under control. My hair began to fall out 13 days after my first treatment but it only thinned out and i didn't need to shave my head until treatment 2. Saying that, just because i had those SEs doesn't mean you will, everyone is different. There is a monthly Chemo group which is good to be part of because then you can go through it with others and there are lots of people about with advice and support.

I am 7 weeks post chemo, but in the last couple of weeks i have felt like i have a constant lump in the back of my throat. Sorry if this sounds disgusting but its just phlegm and once its clear the lump goes but comes back within 5/10 minutes.  Its not painful but i can tell it's there all the time. I've also been burping alot. Wondered if it could have something to do with the lansoprazole i've been taking every day so stopped taking it but it hasn't made any difference.  Does anyone think it's anything to worry about or is it just one of those things i have to wait to go away on its own.  I am booked in for my lumpectomy on the 7th January and don't want it to delay it if it's something dodgy.",

I'm not sure i ever read any of the information the hospital gave me. I started reading about chemotherapy and it scared me so i stopped reading it. What you have to remember is everyone is different, just because i had a side effect doesn't mean you will, everyone is different.  Try not to be scared, i broke all mine into parts, first part first chemo, and so one because if you look at it as 18 weeks it seems a lifetime, but by breaking it into parts it flew by. I look back now and think did that really happen to me. I didn't have a PICC line but i wish i had, when i went for my op a couple of weeks ago the anaesthetist commented on how much the chemo had knackered up my veins.  After i had finished my FEC-T the MRI showed no cancer cells, i could have finished there and then but i was told by my consultant that having a lumpectomy and radiotherapy will reduce the risk of it reoccuring, so while i'm at it i might as well have the full lot.  Main advice for your FEC is to make sure you take your anti- sickness medication even if you don't feel sick, i was only actually sick once and that was because i hadn't taken an anti sickness tablet soon enough. Want to know anything give me a shout will be more than happy to help make this easier for you.",

I can't compare it to pac/carbo as i had docetaxel with mine but i can tell you some of the side effects i had. The main side effect with the EC is nausea, luckily i was only actually sick once but felt sick the other times. You will be given anti sickness tablets make sure you take them even if you don't feel sick, they will keep it at bay. Also i lost my appetite so forgot to eat but because i forgot to eat i felt sick, vicious circle really. So i found eating little but often helped keep the sicky feelings at bay too. I also suffered terribly with heartburn,i was drinking gaviscon by the bottle but mentioned it to my chemo nurse who spoke to the pharmacist. He prescribed me lansoprazole it's amazing, from the day i started taking it i have had no more heartburn it also helped with the nausea. The way i described my cycle of EC was a poopy week, a not so poopy week and a good week.  Anything else you want to know just give me a shout more than happy to help x",

There is also a  Family and Friends Group that you may find helpful for support for you.  Please remember everyone is different so just because someone has had a certain side effect it doesn't mean your wife will. Also try and take it each treatment at a time, and count it as one down and not how many left to go. Once i got started it found it went quicker than i thought.  Be sure that your wife takes the anti sickness tablets even if she doesn't feel sick and don't hesitate to ring the chemo unit if you have any concerns.  I found eating little and often helped, with feeling sick i didn't always fancy eating but by not eating i felt sick. So i made sure i had something even if i didn't fancy it. Just one other thing, no question is a silly one so come and ask us.

All i can say is ask lots of questions, maybe write them down before you go for your appointment so you don't forget any. It can all be a bit of a blur but have faith in the people looking after you they do this every day. As for your treatment everyone is different. I had chemotherapy first on the hope it would shrink the tumor or get rid of it all together, on my MRI scan once my chemo had finished showed no cancer but i've still had a lumpectomy and will soon have radiotherapy. the lumpectomy and radiotherapy are belt and braces, to reduce the risk of it reoccuring.  I had my lumpectomy 18 days ago and haven't had any problems, would have only been in hospital for the day but was sick due to the anaesthetic, but was still only in for 24 hours. I will be having 15 zaps of radiotherapy over 3 weeks and been told that it only makes you tired.  Hope this helps a little bit if not sorry for waffling.

      "Content": "Hiya Welshmakem first can i say well done on getting through the chemo, its no easy task but you've done it, you should be proud. I had chemotherapy then a lumpectomy with 3 lymph nodes removed. the lymph nodes came back clear but i didn't have clear margins from the lumpectomy. I went on to have a second lumpectomy to be told they had found a 5mm tumor and so went on to have a mastectomy. The reason i had the lumpectomies was because my nurse asked how would i feel if i had a mastectomy and was told there was only a small piece of cancer left and i had lost my whole breast because of it. Unfortunately i ended up having a mastectomy anyway but it was worth trying the lumpectomies first on the hope of saving my boob. In my opinion lumpectomies are a doddle compared to a mastectomy and if had got clear margins it would have definitely have been worth it. My cancer is triple negative and so supposedly harder to get rid of.I do think about the future but i have every faith in my consultant to do whatever he believes is best for me. ",

Try not to worry about stuff you might not need to worry about, and being here is the best thing you have done. The people on here are amazing, they listen when your sad, they listen when your angry and believe it or not they make you smile and laugh too. Remember no question is a silly question, anything you need to know someone has either been there or are going through it and it is reassuring to know you're not alone. I have ranted on here when i've had a bad day and there is always someone around to cheer you up and tell you not to be so hard on yourself, it really is the best place to be for support.",

I never felt my lump, i only found out because i had a mammogram when i was 47. We have all been where you are and totally get the not remembering, so next time you go if you have any questions write them down to ask once you get there. But the lady was right in what she said breast cancer is treatable, i know because i got the all clear last Tuesday. That doesn't help you now but i hope it does give you a bit of a piece of mind. You are doing the right thing with google, it is out of date and gives incorrect information. I read that my cancer was hard to get rid of, it filled me with dread and here i am with it all gone. So all that unnecessary worrying.  Keep talking to us, the people here give fantastic advice and support. Take Care xx",

I can't help with your question as i had chemo to reduce the size of my lump before surgery but i am sure there will be someone around who will be able to help. Whatever you decide be sure its what you want to do. If you feel you are ready for the op then ask if you can have it. Don't feel pressured into doing something else because they have given you another option. I hated deciding for myself even told my consultant i didn't like it when he gave me choices and prefered it when he made the decisions. He still made me chose.  Or ring you're breast care nurse and speak to her, when i was given the choice between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy she didn't make the decision for me but she did ask me questions about things i hadn't thought of which helped me make a decision. Hopefully someone will be along soon with some advice.",

My daughter found a lump, and mentioned it to me the week after i'd been diagnosed ioth BC, she was 23 at the time and the practice nurse she saw couldn't feel the lump but took her word for it and referred her to the Breast Care Team at the hospital she was seen within a week. When she got to the hospital they did a ultra sound scan and was told it was fibroadenoma. The nurse told her if she'd been 25 they would have given her a mammogram and taken a biopsy.  The Breast Care specialist told her that if ever she found any more or felt there was a change in the lump she has to ring them direct and she can go back and get checked out as often as necessary. So maybe if your doctor won't refer you to the Breast Care Clinic maybe contact then direct. The nurses there are amazing and i am sure they will help and support you all you need.",

Also good for advice before you start your chemo etc, so you know what to expect and it makes it someone less scary. Financial help: I struggle too, i'm single so run my house myself, my hospital is a 60 mile round trip and my first worry was how am i going to afford to pay for petrol. So went to speak to the Macmillan lady at the hospital, because i don't get any benefits i was not entitled to any help from them. But since then i have contacted my Union and they have a welfare fund and may send me a donation to help me out with petrol costs, i was also told about a charity that is run in my village who will give help towards petrol costs. I am currently waiting to hear from them both, i didn't want to ask for help but as a friend said if i don't ask for it someone else will, i pay into my union every month so why shouldn't i get help from them. If you need a wig you may be able to get help with that too, if you go to patient services at the hospital they will help you out.  But back to this place remember no question is a silly question, its probably been asked before, if you're feeling sad tell us, if you want to rant then rant away and believe it or not this place will sometimes have you laughing.

I was also told to do them just before bed as sometimes they can cause aches and pains but nothing major, because i did mine before i went to sleep i never had any.

Don't take it that because they say its more complicated that the outcome will be any different it may be something like they need to change your treatment plan. I was told mine was going to be easy to get rid of but it had other ideas and it wasn't as plain sailing as first thought but i still got the all clear a couple of weeks ago. I say i took the scenic route instead of the motorway. As long as you get to the same destination then all's good. By me replying on here it will bump it back up to the top so hopefully someone else will be along with a reply soon, who knows better than me.

No one gets what it's like unless they have been or are going through it. I met up with a friend at the end of last week who also had BC and we both commented on how many times people tell you how well you look but inside you feel really poopy. Talk to us, you have already had a reply from the amazing AnnJac who has just got me through one of the hardest weeks i've had so far, even though shes going through a tough time herself.  Don't feel ungrateful, feel glad you have people around you for the physical care and love, then come to us for the emotional stuff, Now i have finished chemo i don't seem to have as much attention from family and friends even though my last week was probably the hardest so far, but i have an amazing daughter and son who listen and get what i'm saying. Do you talk to your kids? i've been honest with mine from the start which i think has helped them cope with it better because they haven't been left to wonder whats going on. Its ok to have poopy days, no one can go through what we are and paint on a smile every day, so don't be so tough on yourself. Take each day as it comes, once you know you're treatment you will feel better because you'll know whats coming, but until them keep talking.  Big Hugs for you and don't ever be sorry for anything you post, thats why we are all here xxx",
