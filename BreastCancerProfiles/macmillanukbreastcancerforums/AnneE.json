    "Content": "I know exactly how you feel but this does pass very quickly and you will enjoy things again. I am not on radio though I did have one blast which helped a lot but can't have any more as the cancer has also given me osteoporosis. Otherwise on same drugs and infusion as you. Ian sat in garden in the shade at the moment as sun got too hot, shall go back out soon as it's lovely. Blood test tomorrow and infusion on Wednesday then scans again the following week so busy time. Still just had a week in Southern hold which set me up again.",
