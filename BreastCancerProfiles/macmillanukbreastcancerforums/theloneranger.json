    "Content": "Hi mrs beezley, I have jumped over here from the leukaemia group. It is very frustrating when your white cell count is a non mover, i have been there more times than i care to remember. Yes the longer you are neutropenic the more likely you are to get an infection, but that does not mean you will. As far as i know there is no magic way to increase the white cell count, it just increases in its own time. When treatment keeps being put back it does seem that the end will never come but it will!  As i said i has been neutropenic more times than i have had hot dinners (and thats a lot) and during my 3 years of chemo i have only ever had 2 infections.  We were never allowed the white cell boosting injection because that was seen as 'cheating' Your white cells is an indication that your bone marrow has taken a beating from the chemo. Hopefully the cells will start to increase so you can get back on track and wave byebye to all this chemo.",
