I called the clinic today to see when my app would be and was told there is an 8 - 10 week wait and thats an urgent app. So annoyed i have family history of BC but also how can they expect women to wait that long. ",

I cannot afford to go privately so guess ive got a long couple of months of waiting. I will call the helpline on Monday for advice though. Jess xx",
