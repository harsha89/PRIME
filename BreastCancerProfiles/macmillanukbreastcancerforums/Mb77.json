Today is a bad day and that is totally allowed. It's such a huge roller coaster. Hopefully you will feel much better tomorrow. I keep hearing people say we seem to be coping almost too well with it all - but the day I got my list of appointment dates for chemo I sobbed like a baby through shock I think - I'm not sure why it hit me then and not through the surgery but we are all human and a little vent and cry does wonders sometimes. Much love and hugs and good luck with the treatment. Marianne xx",

Everyone we have told (not completely public knowledge yet) either knows someone who has had a different sort of cancer but much worse and sort of treats me like what am I making a fuss about. Or else they haven't really said anything. My partner says I come across as positive and strong so people don't know what to say or don't feel they can bring it up. But these are family and close friends. I know I would give much more support if the shoe was on the other foot. I'm dreading it becoming public knowledge as I've heard you find out who your friends are! But I've also heard that support comes from the people you least expect too. Good luck for your results on Thursday - we will always support you and listen on here!! Xx",

I have 2 boys aged 1 and 9 - I have found that even getting to the hospital apps are difficult with the kids around school runs etc. the good thing about kids is that they seem to take everything in their stride and just accept things. It is hard at the beginning worrying about results etc but the best thing is to take it step by step. I found the waiting the hardest. Once I had the op I felt as though I was a step closer to being free of it and closer to my life returning to normal. So it won't be long before you've taken that first step too. Lots of hugs xxx",

      "Content": "Hi suze, I have my 6th and final FEC tomorrow. I'm 37 with 2 little boys aged 9 and 1. It all does seem scary at the beginning and it all moves quite fast. It is the fear of the unknown, once the first chemo is done you know exactly what to expect. I can promise it's not as bad as you imagine. The media image of frail women throwing up for months just isn't true. I expected I would be completely useless for 18 weeks but in reality I have managed to do the school run every day, fed and bathed the kids etc. I think if you asked my eldest he would say that it hasnt been too different from normal apart from mummy being tired a bit. I threw up once the first time then they gave me stronger anti sickness and I haven't thrown up since. The first week after FEC for me feels like a 7 day bad hangover - can't sleep, then all I want to do is sleep, tummy not right (constipation one day, diarrhoea the next), head not right - headache etc, mouth not right - no taste, mouth dry, nothing tastes right, constantly thirsty. In that first week the worst thing I think is the fatigue but it does only last a few days so I just leave anything that isn't desperate - the housework gets left, no ironing, kids have an easy tea etc. but even on this week I have had to do the school run etc. Then after 7/8 days things go back to normal for 2 weeks. In those two weeks life is pretty much normal and I've done days out farms, zoo etc, met friends, meals out, even went to the theatre (you're not supposed to go places you can get infection though so perhaps don't follow my example!). I was expecting them to give me the choice of chemo as I had clear nodes and we decided that even if it was 1% better chance with chemo that I would take it as I wanted to be able to always tell the kids that I did everything I possibly could to give them the chance to have their mum here and healthy as long as possible. What if the % was actually time - what if it was an extra healthy 6 months etc. As it happens they didn't give me a choice they said because I'm under 45 they give chemo as a matter of course and I'm quite glad they didn't give me the decision in the end. Almost 7% to lower the risk of reoccurrence is quite a good percentage. A lot of women on here do have to make the choice with only a 1% increase in odds. Whilst winter brings the worry of coughs and colds (both mine did catch them during my chemo but I managed not to) summer brought the heat and sun which I found hard. Some of the really hot days that were on my bad week were very difficult. So I think at least in winter you wouldn't have that to deal with. Others in my chemo unit have had similar experiences to me. I know that some people do find it tough but the people I meet in the unit are all the same as me with one bad week then 2 good ones. Does your hosp have a support group? Mine is great and we have a real laugh. There are people there at all different stages and it really does make you realise that it's do-able as everyone says. The actual medical side of things hasn't been too bad. The emotional side is harder. The whole hair thing being the hardest I found but even that was better in reality than I expected it to be. My eldest was most worried about me losing my hair, in the end when it started to fall out he actually asked me to shave it so it didn't fall out in his dinner! So even that wasn't as bad as he had expected it to be. Anyway, I hope that helps a bit to explain my experience of it. If you've hit any more questions let me know.",

      "Content": "Hi Yes node clearance is operation under general anaesthetic. I had my lumpectomy last week and I was lucky that my hospital has a machine that checks the nodes during the op then they take them out then and there if need be - but my nurse said in some cases people have to have a further op to remove more nodes. Even though I had nodes checked during op there is still a chance I may have to have further surgery as the lump itself has to have a certain about of cancer free tissue around it removed as well so if when they analyse the lump they find there isn't enough clear radiance then they would have to operate again to remove a bit more. I think they try to keep a balance between removing too much tissue and the need for further operations. The important thing is they get as much infected tissue and nodes out even if that takes more than one op. You are doing the right thing just taking it one step at a time. I can't believe I was diagnosed less than a month ago and already been through so many emotions plus surgery in such a short time! Just take it step by step, week by week. Sending hugs Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, sorry you're joining the gang. I'm 36 and I had my first chemo 3rd June and he 2nd one yesterday and used cold cap for both. I'll be honest it was nowhere near as painful as I'd imagined or heard. You do get a headache but it does go after ten minutes then Â you cant really feel it. Later once home and defrosted I got a cracking headache and felt like I had a hangover but it went when I took pain killers. Yesterday I took painkillers before I started the cap and topped up half way through and this helped but the headache when I got home was worse. However, it hasn't worked for me. My hair started falling 8 days ago - I thought I had got away with it as Id heard it would thin quite a lot anyway but then Â every time I moved about 50 strands fell out. It never once fell on the pillow etc but it was upsetting to start with. Now I'm more scalp than hair and think the time has probably come to shave what is left but I'm actually ok with that now. I only did the cap yesterday out of stubborness! BUT I am so glad I tried it otherwise I would have always wondered what if. My advice would be try it if you want to. What have you got to lose? If you don't like it when it's on then take it off the nurses aren't going to force you to keep it on. And if it doesn't work after one session then you don't have to do it again. Just keep in mind that it might not work and if it does then it's a bonus. Best of luck with it all. Marianne xx",

      "Content": "Hi, Sorry you've found yourself in this position. However you have found the right site very early on and you will get lots of support and advice on here. I was diagnosed with grade 3 invasive ductal a few weeks ago and had my lumpectomy yesterday. It wasn't too bad and I put a post on earlier today with my experience of the op and some ideas that may help. You will feel very scared right now but I promise in a few days you will start to feel stronger and see the light at the end of the tunnel. There are so many amazing ladies on here that have been through it all and come out the other end. I was terrified myself 3 weeks ago but I slowly got stronger and more positive from reading into it and hearing all the positive stories from others. 3 weeks later I'm lumpless!!! Although still have the chemo and rads to come. But in 2 weeks you will also be lumpless so that's a huge positive step to get done. With regards to your questions from what I have seen on posts you do feel tender for about two weeks. I've been told not to lift anything heavier than a kettle for 2 weeks (difficult when I have a 1 year old!). If you live by yourself I think you might want someone to stay with you for the first 24 hours. I had my op at 8.30 yesterday morning and still felt incredibly drunk from all the drugs last night and had to get my partner to walk behind me up the stairs as I was so wobbly. I feel fine today though. You will get some great positive messages on here. Feel free to message me and ask any other questions. In the meantime sending lots of hugs Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy, Sorry to hear about your mum. I think that having already experienced cancer and seen someone go through it means that you are much more grounded when it comes to going through it yourself. I think that people imagine they would be in a blind panic or that you spend every minute depressed etc. When I told my friends how much we laughed at my support group they couldn't believe it - they assume the cancer unit is full of people weeping and wailing but actually when you are faced with the diagnosis you just kind of get on with it really ( well after a couple of weeks or so!) I had my lumpectomy on 1st May and my plan is chemo, then rads, then tablets. I'm Her2 negative and mine was a grade 3 so thank goodness it's out now! I lost my wonderful dad to lung cancer and it is a really horrible cancer as you are already very poorly before you even know you have it. Dad only knew when his tumour was so big it cracked his rib from the inside and all treatment was done to prolong life, to give him extra months to say goodbye really. So when he had his chemo he was already very poorly with a great big tumour. However, with breast cancer, if you have the tumour removed first, we go into treatment mostly fit and healthy with no tumour and treatment becomes an insurance (hopefully) against reoccurrence and a process to catch any stragglers before they set up home rather than a life extender. So we are in a much better position. But because I have seen the very very bad side I know my treatment hopefully will be easier and I can cope with that. I have been positive throughout and my friends think its odd, that somehow I don't know what's going to hit me. But I do, I know more than they can imagine! I am not anxious or worried either, i just want to get the treatment started so its over sooner and i can hopefully have a great xmas with the bad bit behind me. In my house normal things still have to happen and life has to go on despite the cancer the kids still need feeding, the school run needs doing, its the mother in law and sister in law birthdays coming up so presents and cards to be bought so if im panicking about my treatment it wouldnt help anyone! So I think it's great that you are calm and grounded and looking forward in a rational way. And its normal too. The alternative would be to panic, go crazy, depressed and that would just make the whole thing harder! Keep doing what you're doing. Take care, Marianne xx",
