    "Content": "Not sure if things are different in England but here in Scotland Patient Transport can take you home, provided you're not sedated and do not require medical expertise (there are no health professionals on the vehicle, just a driver and sometimes an assistant). The ward will be able to book this for you. There's also a secure locker beside every bed, things can get stolen if you're in a ward and leave possessions lying around but it's rare and can happen anywhere. Give the ward a call when you find out where you're going and talk it through with them, I'm sure they'll put your mind at ease X  Oh just found this, there is a transport service in England too  http://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/how-do-i-organise-transport-to-and-from-hospital/#non-emergency-patient-transport-services",
