      "Content": "Hi SFGS Monday will seem a long time away at the moment so yes, ring your BCN and describe your symptoms. There\u2019s nothing to be lost by doing that and it will alleviate your worry to some extent at least. Pain in the night isn\u2019t good, lack of sleep makes things worse, and the imagination runs riot!  No doubt the nurse will confer with the oncologist if she needs to. A good nurse is worth her (his?) weight in gold. Hope you feel better soon. Take care.",

      "Content": "Hi Suzy, I changed oncologists after 10 months - my confidence in the first one and the whole team was gradually worn away. In my case that actually meant changing hospitals but it was the best decision I could have made as the new place is great and I feel much better cared for and supported. I did some research and then asked my GP to refer me elsewhere. It wasn\u2019t a problem, no difficult questions asked, patients have a right to second opinions and to be treated where they choose. Hope that helps.",

      "Content": "Hello Annie I decided to have a look at this thread to see if the side effects from Paclitaxel were shared with anyone and they obviously are! So I sympathise with the blocked and (this morning bleeding) nose, the dodgy stomach and the achy legs, although I\u2019ve not had the cystitis so far.  I don\u2019t know about you, but I get paranoid about it all - are they side effects or symptoms of something else happening so it\u2019s reassuring to find someone with similar stuff going on. I\u2019ve had 3 doses so far with the next one due Thursday. I\u2019ve a clinic appointment first so I have a list of side effects to tell them about, including a rash on my hands which started after being in the garden and getting a couple of insect bites which flared up. The GP gave me steroid cream for that and it\u2019s starting to disappear.  I have to trust that it\u2019s the best way forward as you say but it\u2019s hard sometimes to believe that putting all this chemical stuff into my body is good! Thanks for your positive take on it all.",
