      "Content": "Hi Pennymoon, so sorry after all that time you're going through it again, something I'm sure we all dread.. poor you I don't know what stage of treatment you're at so this may not be helpful but thought I'd mention it.  I read on the Anastrozole instructions that we must inform our dentist that we're taking it. I saw my dentist last week and mentioned it. He looked up the reason and said the medication can cause dry mouth which in turn can cause build up of tartar, plaque.  Apart from telling me to drink water, even if it's sipping often, he said if it gets bad he can recommend a spray that my gp can prescribe.  Apparently Anastrozole can also be a cause of mouth soreness and ulcers.  Hope that may be of some help at some time.. Good luck with all treatment. Hugs, Annie ❤ xxxx",

Cared for elderly aunts for years, am my disabled son\u2019s carer.Usually the one driving, picking up friends etc. .Never in my life had I \u201cgiven in\u201d but I didn\u2019t ask for help, it was offered. I could have driven myself but my husband and my daughter really wanted to be there for me, so I let them be! And I was so greatful for their company, plus I honestly believe it did them some good to be involved as they were so worried (more than I was to be honest!) and better to be with me than sitting at home worrying and wondering.. Friends offered lifts too and if needed I\u2019d have asked.. Yes, take your O/H tomorrow. Take books, iPad, magazines if you\u2019re in for a long day?  The worst part is the waiting. Once you\u2019re started you get into a routine and before you know it, it\u2019ll be over! Hope all goes well.  If you celebrate it, I hope you manage to enjoy Christmas. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Mavi. Really sorry you\u2019ve had such rubbish news and just before Christmas too.. But. The main thing is that you\u2019re on it, you\u2019re going to be treated, you\u2019ve caught it early. I think it\u2019s great you can work from home! That will be a godsend I\u2019m sure.  It\u2019s ok to cry, it\u2019s better to release your feelings than hold them in.  I don\u2019t know if you have Facebook and messenger, but what I did was to start messenger groups. I put my family into one, and different friends into a couple of others. That way I could let them all know as much (or as little) as I wanted to. And it saved me from repeating myself over and over. I\u2019d copy and paste the same messages adding or deleting bits here and there. They could then respond as they wished and their messages were very comforting.  Once your treatment starts you may feel a bit better, you\u2019re told what to do, you\u2019re looked after. You can stop wondering what\u2019s going to happen once it\u2019s happening!  My advice.. If people offer to accompany you, give you lifts, take them up on it. Allow them to help. It\u2019s nice to have company at hospitals, and it\u2019s good to talk! .  Let us know how you\u2019re getting on. Good luck. Love and hugs. Annie xxx ❤️❤️❤️",

I think because the nurses could see I was \"sailing\"  through it all that they warned me several times I'd feel worse before I felt better and they were right. I'd take it easy, do your exercises, and wait to see what's next before making definite work plans? Good luck! ❤️❤️❤️ Xx",

I think some others around me were far more upset and concerned for me than I was! And I'm quite sure everyone was waiting for me to break down. But like you, I just thought, right, this is how it is, you're  getting all necessary treatment, get on with it. Having said that,  I fully understand why others can't think like that because we're all different with very different emotions. The only one time I shed tears (apologies to anyone who's  already read this as I've said it before) was my daughter telling me about my grandson's reaction. He was 13 last year when I was diagnosed. The Christmas before I'd bought him one of those leather bracelets with a little tag that says something about him being a lovely grandson. Knowing what he's like, I'd said I didn't mind if he never actually wore it but would like him to keep it even if it went in a drawer! My daughter said after she'd told my grandchildren about me he went off and shut himself away in his  bedroom. Then when he appeared again later he was wearing the bracelet. He's a quiet lad, doesn't show his feelings very much so I can't tell you how much that touched me.. Other than that, no, I've been fine and it's coming up to a year ago  since I finished radiotherapy. No tears, no real worries. It was here and now it's gone ❤️ Love to one and all xxx",

He looked it up and explained to me that the medication can cause very dry mouth which in turn can cause build up of tartare more easily causing decay. He suggested sipping water regularly to prevent my mouth drying which I try to do.  I've had a bit of a problem on and off though recently and he's told me I could have a tooth that's slowly dying off (don't know which one as the pain seemed to be all across one side of my mouth) but an X-ray won't show the problem so I have to go in straight away when the pain returns.  I'm 66 so suppose it's expected I might get the odd problem but I was surprised as my dental health score is 2 which is apparently pretty good.  The problems seem to never end!!  Good luck with your treatment, I used to be terrified too but it's all so much improved from years ago and I'm sure you'll be fine.  Love and hugs, Annie xx ❤️",

The good thing is you've acted straight away, and let's hope it's an annoying cyst!  This past three weeks I've been attending a \"Moving forward after breast cancer\" course. There are quite a lot of us attending, all ages, all having had  different types of ops and cancers. Some have had chemotherapy , some radiotherapy.  The main thing is, we are all here! We are all alive and kicking and talking about our holidays!  Having breast cancer these days is far more treatable than ever, we're actually very lucky to have such wonderful staff to care for us and fantastic treatment available. Saying that, an aunt of mine had breast cancer when she was forty. She passed away just two years ago from natural causes aged 'one hundred and one'!!!! And bear in mind the treatment back then wasn't anywhere near as good as it is now. So please, please don't think that even IF you have breast cancer it's a death sentence!!   But we're jumping way ahead. I really hope you come back here and tell us it was a false alarm. If not, come and talk to us. There are some lovely ladies on here, always ready to chat and listen.  Easy for anyone to tell you not to worry because you still will, that's absolutely natural. Try to store your scary thoughts away in a box. Leave the box closed, throw it out if you can. Do some nice things with your daughters if you're able to, anything to take your mind off it and please stop googling lol! We've all done it and trust me, it doesn't help!!  Big hugs, hope all turns out well. Annie Xxx ❤️❤️❤️",

In spite of me not having lost my hair I know that if I had, i'd find this very upsetting, in fact it upsets me anyway! . I recently attended \"Moving Forward after Breast Cancer\" and some of the ladies had hair loss, most had it growing back but it broke my heart to see so many beautiful women feeling so upset with their hair loss. Strangely enough over the four weeks course we didn't talk about fund raising of any kind, I wish now I'd brought up the subject of this shaving to fund raise to see how everyone felt. I know if I'd gone through hair loss the thought of any of my family or friends shaving their heads horrifies me! I'm really surprised and shocked Macmillan haven't taken any notice of the amount of people who're against it. I wonder why they've allowed it? X❤️❤️❤️X",

No one needs to see that, no matter what age, no matter how severe or not your scars are.. We don't see people showing any other results from other operations, I just don't see the need.. It most certainly doesn't make me feel better about my now disfigured breast! the last thing I could ever do is show anyone my scars.. It's not brave, it's not helpful. In fact I think it could make some women feel even more terrified that they could end up looking like that.  So I agree, stop the shaving of heads and stop the naked breasts. Please. ",

I've had some weird things said to me and I only had radiotherapy after my lumpectomy so luckily didn't lose my hair. But I've felt quite irritated at times, one friend comparing my breast cancer with her having the bags under her eyes done.. Almost everyone starts telling you about \"so and so\" who had \"this or that operation\"  who survived, who died etc etc... But I know everyone has tried their best to be kind. So I've just smiled and let it all pass over me.. Nothing anyone says can really and truly help us feel better.. In some ways I feel like I've had to put others at ease, make them feel better! But after all I've been through (and I know many of you lovely ladies have been through far worse)  I'm just glad my cancer was found early, glad I've been cared for so well by our NHS, glad I'm still here and people and things are not going to be allowed to bother me like they used to!  Love 'n hugs xxx ❤️",

I'm wondering if the same conversations and concerns we see here are also on other types of cancer sites? It'd be interesting to know if the subject of brave the shave has been discussed on, for example, the Macmillan bowel cancer site? The word needs to be spread as it's pretty obvious Macmillan aren't doing much about it. I'd like to bet most of these people shaving their heads would be quite shocked to know how sufferers feel? ",

Many are very upset but the response from Macmillan is pretty standard. Not blaming those who have to respond, I\u2019d imagine  they\u2019re just acting on orders from above, but the responses come across as caring more for the \u201cbrave\u201d shavers than those who\u2019ve actually had cancer and no choice but to shave their hair off.  Macmillan, in my opinion, have got this very wrong and although they say the right things they really are not listening, not taking notice, not caring, and doing nothing to stop this. Money talks. Shame. ",

I've been taking it for about eight months. I don't do my own hair, I let my hairdresser do it, it's a bit awkward at home with leaning over the sink as I suffer back pain.  I think I'll maybe cut down how often I have it done, I'm dreading my hair thinning. As I've got older I've always thought my hair to be my crowning glory haha!! But of course there's far worse going on for other ladies than a bit of thinning hair!!  Many thanks for replying. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Flopsyuk. I'm coming up to a year in June since I finished radiotherapy. My nipple is still discoloured but lighter than it was a year ago. I saw a doctor at the hospital just last week (have never seen my surgeon since the op) I think it is frustrating that we don't seem to get the answers we want to hear. I have felt fobbed off too but then I think am I just being impatient? My mammogram has come back clear (thank goodness) I was told last week that healing takes longer in some than others as I'm still feeling discomfort, can't lie on that breast in bed for long and thought by now it'd be back to \"normal\" though of course it'll never look the same again. I'm just going to tell myself I'm luckier than a lot of women, I still have my boobs! Or at least, one and three quarter boobs!  We have to trust the experts but I was told in no uncertain terms that if anything doesn't feel right, if I'm at all worried, to not wait for my next mammogram but get in touch and go in to see them. One suggestion I'd give  is to write everything down that you want to ask. It's so easy to forget what you want to say when in with the doctor.. good luck, hope all goes well. Annie xxx ❤️",

In that sense I'm lucky my children are adults and my grandchildren old enough to understand. Also my husband is self employed so he can always be available to take me to appointments, though saying that in my last week of radiotherapy he had a heart attack!! It was touch and go but after three stents fitted he's doing pretty well! It never rains but it pours.. I must get my act together and stop these morbid thoughts! Because of other ongoing health problems, mainly back pain, redundancy,  and other stuff, we haven't been abroad for 16 years and haven't had a holiday at all for 12 years so this holiday will be a very welcome break!  I understand your paranoia Stephanie, it really is scary wondering what doctors are going to find!!

We also have suspicions the cancer is on our paternal side., my great aunt and my aunt were my on my Dads side, plus he had brothers who had cancer.  I really don't think anything should be dismissed because anything's possible isn't it.  I do agree with you about screening. Both myself and my sister who've had lumpectomies had our cancer discovered during routine screening, whereas my sister who died (following her mastectomy as the cancer was very aggressive and spread rapidly) had never attended her mammogram appointments and by the time hers was discovered it really was too late. In fact she died 12 years ago today. And then in the following years it's been another sister and then now myself. Interestingly, our eldest sister is 85 (20 years older than me) and it was her daughter who died aged 49 but this sister has, thankfully, remained cancer free.  I hope all goes well for you also in the future Karen.
