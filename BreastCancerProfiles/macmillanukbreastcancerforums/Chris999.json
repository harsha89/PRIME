      "Content": "Just popped into this group to say thank you so very much G n'J for all of the support you have given to so many members of all the groups in this site.  You work so hard to ensure that no one goes without an answer if you are able to give advice, and if not you will advise them where to post to find someone who can help. Your sense of humour is brilliant, and appeals to all age groups and constantly makes me laugh. Have a lovely Christmas you two, and I send my prayers for your Sister-in-law to have a good recovery from her heart andcirculatory problems. lots of love and ho ho ho hugs to you both, and thank you for being you Chris xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi patk1959, I would follow the good dvice of Mistymoley,  and if you find that the reflux and back pain continue, I would ask if they can do an endoscopy to make sure the cid isn't causing any long term damage to your oesophagus. It could be the effects of the chemotherapy if it has just started, but heartburn and acid reflux for three week period or longer needs to be investigated, just to put your mind at rest. Please watch out for the ads on TV, Be Clear on Cancer. Hope this clears up soon, and that you have a good outcome from your chemotherapy. Love and hugs Chris xxxx",

      "Content": "The Prof who is my hero and did my surgery is a well sought after man. The upper GI team have an annual coffee morning just before Christmas for all of their survivors. It started off many moons ago in a small side room on the ward, as you could count the survivors on one hand. The last few years it has become such a big affair , and they hold it in The Civic Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. Last years coffee morning was the day following my surgery so I obviously wasn't there, but my Husband and Daughter went. They told me that poor Prof was besieged by women fluttering their eyelashes at him, and posing for photographs with him. There are between seven and eight hundred survivors who attend these days. They have a book in the reception for everyone to give their name, the year of their surgery, and how many years they have been clear of cancer. I look forward to going this December to add my name to the list, as by then I will be one year post surgery. He is a wonderful man with a lovely personality, and the best surgeon anyone could wish for. Chris xxxx",

I would however suggest that you telephone the helpline to speak to a qualified nurse.  They will find out the information you are looking for, if they don't already know the answers. The free Helpline number is 0808 808 0000 and us open 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday.  I hope they are able to put your mind at rest, and that your treatment gives you good results. love Chris xxxxx",

If someone who has not had chicken pox comes into contact with shingles, they can catch chickem pox from them. Hope you don't come down with any symptoms, as you shouldn't, but I don't know if the chemo would reduce the antibodies to this disease. love and hugs Chris xxxx",
