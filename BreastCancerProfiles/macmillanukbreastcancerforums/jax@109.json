They tell me I could be home as early as day 3 or 4 if I can manage the drains at home. Part of me is being quite level-headed about it and thinking well, it's the next big step in my treatment and a step toward getting my life back. The other part of me is terrified! I'm told 15% chance of lymphoedema - which scares me a bit. Then there'll be 15 consecutive days of radiotherapy. Some of the stuff I have read on here has been quite scary .
