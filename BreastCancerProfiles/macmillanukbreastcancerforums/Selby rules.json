    "Content": "Mine was a reconstruction rather than flap and had nipple reconstructed at the same time. Then 8weeks later had the medical tattooing to get the colour. It's worth it it really gives you the look and finish -my sister is still awaiting her nipple reconstruction as her consultant doesn't do them at the op stage as mine did and the difference is marked-she feels \"unfinished\". Even if they collapse as can happen-the recon nurse can get a great 3D effect with the tattoo and looks natural. Bit strange being asked what colour I wanted-hadn't really noticed and certainly hadn't taken a \"before\"picture so the recon nurse could get a good comparison -but I love mine!",
