      "Content": "Hi, all, I am afraid I need advice and support. I've resumed my studies in the University (I'm doing PhD) after being treated for severe breast cancer. Since then the only things I received from University officials (some of very high rank) are insults and threats. Quote: \"You are faking your illness\" <shouted at me by a person who has seen my medical documents and must know that it is not true. Same person then said that he wants to see more of my medical documents, but that even based on them whatever is in them I will not get any \"privileges\". I have only to add that the only thing I asked at that time was to be treated in the same way as other students on the same course. But according to this high ranked official it is a privilege>. I've been demanded to change my medical team and place of living, because the University officials want me to do so (honestly they did notÂ  give any legal support for these requirements but their whim). I am an International student, so they have a great whip for me - the moment I disagree or even ask for legal basis for their demands, - they say that they will withdraw my Visa (and they already tried to do so). I had a surgery few months ago (change of implant). First they granted my request for medical leave, but declared, that two University officers (one of them male, both are absolute strangers to me) will visit me at my house \"to check if you are really ill\" (end of quote). I disagreed and said that they have medical evidence that I am, and I can provide them with more if requested. Two weeks after surgery I was thrown out of the University - for reasons I cannot clarify till now, because University officials deny to answer to only mine, but also my legal representatives' questions on that matter. To make the long story short: after two terrible months my student status was resumed, but no apologies, not a single word of apology was offered to me. They behave as they did before - and with every word in every letter show to me that I should be grateful that I am still studying. As they mentioned before they allow me to study only if I am 100% healthy (which I'll never be - after full mastectomy, after lympho nodes cut out). I am terribly scared. My doctors say that I might need another surgery - previous one was not quite successful, and implant does not sit properly. I am afraid, because the moment I ask for another medical leave they will throw me out again. I am still in remission period and have to wait 5 years till I will be able to say, that I am healthy. I don't know what to do.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your support, I really appreciate that. I've contacted Student Union more than once. The only thing they were able to advice was to submit a complaint. I did so - and my complaint was completely ignored. My legal representative submitted a complaint to Vice Chancellor - it was not even answered, and I have great doubts, that it was even read by Vice Chancellor. I had a solicitor - that's why my student status is renewed. BUT my solicitor is a specialist in Immigration Law, not in Discrimination. He cannot help me further. However he wrote to the University about Equality Act - and this letter was also completely ignored, as if it never existed. When I myself asked when the matters raised in this letter will be answered, the answer was, that they will not answer it because they do not want to (just like this). The requirement to be 100% healthy has nothing to do with my PhD - it is in Psychology, and we do not work with any hazardous materials, most of my research is desk based, even the interviewing part. I feel that the only reason why they want such proof is because the moment they have it, they can say, that I don't need any treatment or adjustments. By the way, that's precisely what one of them said AND wrote to me: if I need any medical treatment, I have to stop my studies and go back to my country; if I want to continue my studies, I don't need any treatment. When I tried to explain to this person, that with cancer it is not so simple, he began to mock me saying that I cannot be both ill and healthy, so I must choose something one. Sorry, I am crying even when I am writing this.",

      "Content": "Sorry for a long silence, I've felt unwell. Thank you for your support and advice, I really appreciate that. I have turned to equality law specialists, but all of them, including those in the centers said that they cannot help - they specialize in discrimination at work, not in education system. According to them technically I am right, but that does not matter. My supervisors know about the situation, but cannot help. Actually they were told by the University officials not to intervene without Uni solicitor's permission. They are still trying to help, but they cannot anything now, except for putting a word for me. If someone wants to listen. It is quite complicated, I am afraid, but that's the situation. They tried what they could - but it did not help: what they said was ignored or taken as a complaint of the attitude towards them, not towards me. My PhD will take at least two more years. I can't work now, hard as I try - just because of the stress and pain. I have to tolerate this - but I am not quite sure that I can. Honestly I do think \"Why at all I was treated and cured?\" I have submitted an official complaint about a month ago, but I don't believe anything good will come out of it. And I just can't bear it anymore. The broad topic will be Psychology. Sorry, I cannot write the precise topic here in the open - it is the only University in the world with this specialisation, and I am the only Jewish student in the University. It will be too easy to find me for anyone who looks.",

      "Content": "I already called McMillan, they gave me few contacts of organisations that might help and supported my thought on that matter: it is a discrimination and breach of equality act. I think about contacting Uni Disability department, but I am scared. Last time I tried to submit a complaint against Uni official who threatened and insulted me, it resulted in very bad outcomes - for me. When I contacted Student Welfare on the same matter, I was told, that first thing they must do is to contact the person who treated me in a bad way and to tell him, I filed a complaint against him. Great - I was bullied before,now I will be bullied even more. The strangest thing of all is that I've contacted UKBA on the matter, and they completely denied the very existence of the laws and regulations my Uni based its claims upon. When I passed this information to the Uni, the Uni, I've got three types of answers: 1) total silence (they ignored the question) 2) explanation that Uni officers know better then UKBA officers, so I must listen only to what UKBA says (same thing they told me, when I brought the lawyer into case - Uni officers know better, then any lawyer according to Uni officers opinion). Third type of answer I quote: \"Who are you to know the law!? You are nobody! I have four professionals here, I will teach you the law!\" My supervisors were and are very supportive and nice, but they cannot do anything - they are under Uni employment, so in many cases the only right left to them is to remain silent. Plus their letters are ignored as well as mine. That's what happened, for example, when I was accused (right after my surgery) in lack of engagement in my studies. The accusation was based on nothing, none even contacted my academic supervisors to check if I am engaged or not (and I was). When my supervisors sent the letter explaining that this accusation is absolutely false, and I am actually one of the best students, this letter was ignored. I thought about changing the Uni. But the problem is that I came specifically for this topic (taught in only one University in the world, I am afraid) and for this supervisor (the founder of the field). Plus according to the law, all my intellectual property created during studies belongs to the University. So the moment I change the place, I loose everything I worked upon for two years.",
