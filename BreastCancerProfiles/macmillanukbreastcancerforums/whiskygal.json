    "Content": "So I was supposed to start radiotherapy for breast cancer following FEC-T x 6 and lumpectomy this past Monday but got surprise news that I am not a candidate for standard radiotherapy (external beam) because of my anatomy so onc has given me 2 options: 1. Removal of all axilla lymph nodes + IMRT OR 2. Removal of all axilla + mastectomy As you can imagine, I was deeply disappointed and a bit like WTF as I thought I was done with the lumpectomy v mastectomy discussion. To further compound things the hospital I was scheduled to have RT has never done IMRT on a breast cancer patient even though it is a world renowned cancer centre so I am still like WTF!!!! So my question to you is this 1. Has anyone out there had IMRT for breast cancer? Where were you treated and how was it? Thanks",
