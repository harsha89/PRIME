    "Content": "Hi all, I wondered if anyone could give me some advice please regarding my situation as I have no idea what's going on or what to think (ok I'll be honet I'm just thinking the worse). My rountine mammogram came back showing 'something' 6 weeks ago. I had another mammogram at the breast clinic and the same thing showed up. The doctors, nurses and me can feel no lump and I have no symptoms. They sent me for an ultra sound and they couldn't see anything on there so I ended up having a biopsy done under x-ray. After an anxious wait that result came back clear with no cancerous cells. They told me they thought what was showing was a wart but they sent me for an MRI scan to look at it closer and to make sure. I thought this was going in the right direction (i.e. nothing too serious) and then my MRI results came back showing more abnormal looking areas. They then did an ultrasound looking at these other area and did a deeper biopsy in this area. (I'm also confused why theses areas didn't show up when they did the first ultrasound two weeks ago?) I'm also wondering if the neg biopsy goes in my favour or makes no difference since it's in a different place now? This has been 6 weeks of living hell and I'm no closer to the end. I've been told to come back on 7 days for the results but no one has indicated what all this means since the MRI scan. I am beyond terrified and even considering not going back next week as I can;t keep doing this.  I know people here aren't doctors etc but can anyone shed some light on what all this MIGHT be? I'd rather have a rough idea to know what I'm facing.  Thanks!",
