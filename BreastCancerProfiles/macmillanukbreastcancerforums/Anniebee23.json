      "Content": "Hello ladies, Thankyou for this forum, have had so much support and advice since being diagnosed. I'm currently half way through my RT and have developed an itchy urticharial rash on both arms, a bit like prickly heat. It seems to respond to being cooled with a menthol based cream but I wondered is this unique to me or does anyone else have experience of this. Its only on my arms and I have not changed any products, soaps etc and only use E45 on the area treated by RT.",

      "Content": "Me too! Had routine mammogram in Dec, recalled, found DCIS at biopsy, lumpectomy Jan 20th where they also found Grade 1, SLNB in March was clear and now half way through my RT. So grateful to everyone and glad to be alive, could have been so different had I not gone for routine mammogram.",
