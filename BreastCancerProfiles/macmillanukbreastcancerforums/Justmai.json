    "Content": "My younger sister was diagnosed with estrogen based breast cancer 4 years ago, she went through chemo, lumpectomy, radiotherapy and she beat it.  She had been in remission for nearly 3 years, 2 weeks ago she had some devastating news that her cancer had returned, rocked our family, sister in bits, I didn't stop crying all weekend, I haven't even seen my sister for 6 months we don't live near each other, I don't drive and public transport is impossible for me due to health and other reasons. I'm in a wheelchair. I wrote a post on family and friends at the time.  pet scan on Monday showed inflammation in a lymph node in head, but the radiographer took a biopsy anyway Drs weren't concerned, almost impossible for that lymph node to be cancerous no direct route and told her that the pet scan had shown the cancer was just localised to the breast, local reoccurrence. Friday she was told that the lymph gland in her head was cancerous. No one understands how this can be the case, surgeon has said oh it's not an issue will just cut it out. Won't be a problem, but how is it there? Does that mean any inflammation in her body will now turn out to be cancer, She is due to have a mastectomy one breast for now let that heal, chemo, a chemo that she doesn't have to worry about infection? Can still go out and go to work while in chemo, did they really need to tell a workaholic that. She needs to rest but she won't. Then have the other boob off and reconstruction.  I'm angry that they keep telling her oh it's nothing to worry about can't possibly be cancer, they said that with the first lump she had  left her 6 months before it grew and she insisted on a biopsy and found it was cancer stage 2 because they left it. This time she insisted something was wrong although again they said no it's ok, she pushed straight away and glad she did God knows what would have happened had they left it another 6 months. Telling her the lymph node couldn't possibly cancerous guess what it is. One in a billion chance. Being haphazard just telling her nothing to be concerned about they will just cut it out. I'm worried they may have missed other lymph nodes seems odd to me it would just be in one that has no route to breast.  I'm guilty that I'm not there not that she needs me, but I need her I have always been over protective towards her, she is 12 years younger than me, and she is 15 years younger than my brother. And always the 100 million pound question why her, like everyone with cancer she doesn't deserve this.  I don't know what to say to her even though she is my sister, I don't know how to support her from afar. I'm scared for her, I'm scared they are missing things. ",
