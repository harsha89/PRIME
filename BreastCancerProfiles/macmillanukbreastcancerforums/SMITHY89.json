      "Content": "Thanks Mezza, for answering some of my questions I can't have reconstruction, as I have a heart condition and other medical factors. They say maybe have one later. I hate hospitals so I wouldn't  be up for that. Glad you felt better in just eight weeks, that gives me hope. I have to stay in over night so they can monitor my heart. I really appreciate your message, regards Pauline ",

      "Content": "Hi Tracy thank's for the reply, this bomb shell takes some getting use to. I to have good friends and hubby, I keep telling hubby it's like a bad dream and I'm waiting to wake up from. I was told that although we don't need all the other treatment these other ladies have, it's still a horrible thing to go through.  I have a group near me their called Breast Friends, I spoke to this lady called Liz she been brilliant, she kept telling me take baby steps, don't think to far ahead. It helps think now not weeks ahead. If you want to stay in touch with me, it would be good maybe we could help each other through the bad days and laugh about the silly days. You can private message me on here. I'd love your company on this new journey of ours           Sending big hugs keep smiling   Pauline xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Karan , Thank's for your message. Yes some days are better than other, told my family if you come round and it's a good day great, but if you come round and it's a low day with lots of tears sorry for that but you see I can't be brave all the while or worry about your feeling, as this has happen to me and I need to come to terms with it in my own time. I know this seem harsh to tell them, but they all go on about I don't know how I'd cope if it were me. Well it's not them, it's me that have to cope,I'm such a positive person normally, who copes with all the families problems. Just under 3 years ago I had 3 stents and a pacemaker for my heart, came out hospital carried on like normal. Then I get this [ like you no lump or pain]  just a few weeks later and my body looks like this. So you see I can't be brave to spare their feeling, I am brave in front of my husband as he's just as shocked as me, he's been brilliant he says I'm still the same person he love before the op. But I do look at other comments on here and I do get angry with my self because lots of you have months of treatment , I know I'm lucky. So why do I feel like this. Sorry didn't mean this as a moaning page  to all that have reply to my first comment many thank this is a brilliant site, best wishes Pauline xxx",

      "Content": "I am having a mastectomy on Monday the 12th May. I'm telling everyone it's just  nuisance and I'll be fine. As that's what they want to here. But I'm really scared after Monday I might not be able to be brave in front of family and friends, part of me say why should I have to be worried about their feeling, it's me it's happening to. My Husband is being great but he's as frighten as me,so he doesn't want to talk about it, I phoned 1 daughter who hasn't spoke to me since I told her, she said can't cope with it , I told her how do you think I feel. Has anyone got advise or experience of how I feel or how I stay positive after Monday.",
