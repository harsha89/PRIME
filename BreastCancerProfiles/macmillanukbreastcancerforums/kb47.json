    "Content": "Morning,  just wondered if anyone could answer a question for me. My mum got her results from her sentinel lymph node biopsy  She had 4 nodes taken during her wide local excision and one of the nodes has cancer cells in it.  She is not having any more surgery under arm but radiotherapy.  Is this classed as a secondary cancer?  hope someone could explain this to me. Thanks.xx",
