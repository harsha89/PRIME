    "Content": "Hi Muriel Anne I live in Wiltshire and I am due to have my Diep Flap reconstruction in January at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.  I have been told to do 250 sit ups a day to prepare.  I am looking forward to it, but I am dreading it at the same time, I hate hospitals and its so far away from my home.  I was diagnosed in April 2009, had a mastectomy in May 2009, full lymph node removal TAC chemo followed by radiotherapy, so this op is hopefully the end to it all, and the start of a new life. Has anyone else been told to do sit ups to prepare for the op? Jo x",
