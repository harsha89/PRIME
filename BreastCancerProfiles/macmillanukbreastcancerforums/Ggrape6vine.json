      "Content": "Hi ,had my first chemo today,got myself into a bit of a state,didn't need to,the nurse stayed with me for the 1 1/2 hours it took,there were 10 of us having treatment,some took longer than me. It is now 6 hours after and I'm fully awake can't sleep.had a couple of hours of palpataions,but that might be because I had a cup of tea and I'm only used to decaf. Hoping the next 3 weeks go quickly with not too many side affects.it is terrifying of the unknown.let me know how you get on Thursday .good luck ,big hugs xxxx",
