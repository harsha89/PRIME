    "Content": "Hi Fiona 72, What happened about your mastectomy reconstruction? I wondered as I am going through the exact same thing. I also am considering double mastectomy, but haven't really spoken to anyone about this yet. I am challenging the decision about reconstruction - if I wake up without a breast, I don't know what I would do. This has all happened so quickly and is so frightening. I hope that you are now well and over your journey. At present, I feel any advice from some one who has 'been there' would be such a help. I know roughly how much weight I have to lose to get down to the BMI I need to be, not much at all, but I feel the lack of empathy and understanding by the plastic surgeon makes me very sad. I too, have a bad self-image, being told you're fat doesn't help much does it?! Best wishes for the future, Lou 28",
