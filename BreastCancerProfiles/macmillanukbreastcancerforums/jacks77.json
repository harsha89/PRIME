      "Content": "Iceberg11 Hi there. Since this post I have had the results back from the Endopredict test and it came back as high for recurrence so I\u2019m halfway through my chemo. I am 100%  sure I did the right thing by having the extra test because it made the decision for me and my onco totally agreed and infact encouraged chemo because of it. With the NHS predict and Oncotype results nobody would give me a firm you should or shouldn\u2019t have chemo and as I said I just couldn\u2019t make that decision alone.  If you fit the criteria then you can ask your onco for the test but you will need to pay privately, the results are very quick too. I hope that\u2019s helped. Xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Iceberg11 The waiting for appointments etc is a pain but it all fits together in the end. My surgeon was always pushing the chemo idea but I wasn\u2019t having any of it, I was actually totally against having chemo done made that quite clear. As I\u2019ve said I had to be sure as nobody would make that decision for me because of being in the grey area until I had the final test. Please don\u2019t worry about what you feel is a delay, my surgery was at the beginning of November and I didn\u2019t start my chemo late January.   I think once you\u2019ve seen the oncologist you will have a clearer picture and a plan which always makes things easier as such.  Keep in touch and let me know how you get on, happy for you to PM me if it\u2019s easier for you xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Moonstar Sorry to jump in on your posts ladies.  I had a 27mm, grade 3, ER+ HER2- tumour removed in November. Clear margins and no node involvement.  The standard NHS test wasn\u2019t decisive so I had the Oncotype DX test. My score came back as 21 which is in the dreaded grey area. My Onco couldn\u2019t say if I would benefit from chemo or not which gave me a dilemma that I didn\u2019t want.  The confusing part re the scoring is that the low cut off is 18, mid is 19 to 30 and above 30 is high. She said that in America they give chemo as low as 11 but felt it\u2019s over used as a treatment there.  I asked about the newer EndoPredict test as this only gives a low or high score. It\u2019s not available yet on the NHS but you can pay for it so I\u2019ve decided to do so. I will have the results within the next few days.  I just don\u2019t want to have chemo unnecessarily or at all if I\u2019m honest but being in the middle with 21 means it\u2019s my decision alone and I couldn\u2019t make that choice. I am a \u2018what if\u2019 person so I need an answer that makes that decision for me one way or the other.  Apologies if the post is a bit long xxxx",

It\u2019s just so confusing as to why boosters are used sometimes and not others. Fingers crossed for you with the creams and I hope you get your start date soon!! Hi Jacmatholmad mmmm I think you\u2019re right, I need to ask them on Monday.  Gablegirl I am a D cup so not big busted. I had clear margins and my lymph nodes were clear so maybe that\u2019s why no boosters. What is an HNA assessment, not heard of it before?  Hi Queenfisher My rads onco consultant (I have an onco for chemo who doesn\u2019t do RT so have 2) said 15 at my consent meeting. It\u2019s only being on here Ive noticed so many ladies mention boosters that I\u2019ve sort of questioned it. I think I\u2019m just going to ask somebody on Monday.  Ginacarla That may be a reason or two for me. I was told after my op that my tumour was right up to my breast skin, that\u2019s actually how I found it myself and I\u2019m over 50.  Twinkle51 I totally agree with you, I think we should all be given the same opportunity to access medication irrelevant of where we live or what a GP practice will allow. My hospital allow £40 towards a wig, I\u2019ve seen others with a much higher allowance and some with nothing at all.  Well I think like most things to do with BC there are just so many variations on types of treatment, drugs used, surgery and so on.  Thank you all for your input, as always so many helpful posts.

I really want to try and avoid anti-sickness meds as I\u2019ve just spent 3 months on them with chemo and they have an impact on me with serious constipation. Only 10 more to go so I\u2019m sure I can put up with it if it definitely goes once the treatment has finished. I started taking my Letrozole at the same time so I\u2019m not sure if it could be them.  DohaYogi Pleased to hear you\u2019re getting through your RT with ease, long may it last.  On the subject of the Oncotype DX score of 21, that was my score too. My onco put the decision on me and I just couldn\u2019t decide what to do. Could I live with saying no to chemo against the possible impact it would have on me. Anyway there\u2019s another test called Endopredict which only has a high or low score for recurrence within 10 years, but it's unavailable on the NHS. I decided to pay for it as it would give me a definite solution to my decision making, it came back with a high score so of course I went for chemo. It\u2019s a massive thing to be asked to decide chemo or no chemo, I needed stats to tell me what to do, others may be able to make the decision on a thought process only. Whatever you decide to do has to be right for you and you alone.  Jackie xx",

I\u2019m having a sentinel node injection the day before my surgery and ultrasound marking. If it\u2019s positive he has already told me that I will need chemo so I am sort of prepared for that but I\u2019m sure it will still be a bit of a shock again.  I am still waiting for the final bit of my biopsy result regarding the Her2  and he said if this is positive also I will need Herceptin which means chemo also as they work together.  Like you I have never liked roller coasters and at the moment I feel I\u2019m permanently on a fast one.  I\u2019ve searched and searched everything but ultimately I feel now what will be will be. Statistics are everywhere and where I fall in to them is an unknown quantity at the moment.  I think once I\u2019ve had the lumpectomy I will know everything and then it\u2019s easier to deal with, it\u2019s the unknown that\u2019s so unnerving.  I took your advice and spent the day with my daughter in law and my beautiful granddaughter who makes me smile the widest smile. She took an order for a virtual meal from me on a little pad and served me a teddy on a plate but at the end of it she got her till out and charged me £5.00  They are the special things that help you get through this.  Thank you so much again Mira and that gentle hug was warmly accepted.

      "Content": "Careermindedoptimist  I had IDC a grade 3, 2.7m ER+ HER-, clear nodes and clear margins as had WLE. My oncotype score was 21 so low intermediate. I was told prior that the cut off for no chemo at my trust was 18 but no discussion of chemo if 19, 20 21 but prepared to if it was 25 or above. My onco did discuss chemo with me even at 21 but would not make a decision for me either way, I told her I just couldn\u2019t make that decision myself. I didn\u2019t want chemo however I was worried that I may be making the wrong decision just based on fear of what chemo would do to me. I opted to pay privately via my onco for the Endopredict test which only gives a high or low result for recurrence. Surprisingly to me and to her I came back as a high risk so chemo it was. I have just had my 3rd EC and nobody would tell you it\u2019s easy but it is very doable. I feel now that I\u2019m throwing everything possible at this and don\u2019t regret my decision. I have 15 rounds of radiotherapy after my chemo has finished and will be on Letrozole.  I really hope your score is low because that intermediate area is too big in my opinion (19 to 30) and to be left to actually make that decision is a really tough call.  please me back and let us know how you get on xxxxxx",

I was told they couldn\u2019t feel anything and to go home and take paracetamol.  My routine mammogram came round at the end of September and I was called in for further tests. Another scan, ultra sound and a biopsy. The doctor told me I had cancer during the ultrasound and then did the biopsy. I sat with a nurse afterwards and she explained that I would come back to get the results and talk to the surgeon and that I would need surgery within 4 weeks of that appointment and radiotherapy about 3 months later. She made the appointment then and there and I\u2019ve got an 11 day wait. I\u2019m only 3 days in and am struggling if I\u2019m honest.  Can they be so sure that it\u2019s definitely cancer at this stage?? Thank you for any help in advance. ",

Add to that the lack of being able to sleep and hey presto everything seems to be just too much to cope with.  I will know what stage I am at after my surgery on the 7th and the outcome as to if it has spread to my lymph nodes. I know if it has then chemo will be added to the treatment likewise if I am Her2 positive.  I am ER+ so know I will need hormone therapy, my consultant said that is a good thing as such.  As I said it\u2019s not knowing and the waiting to find out that is actually more stressful at the moment. I\u2019m trying so hard to have a positive attitude as I know it helps and maybe when I know everything the focus will be different.  I loved your mermaid story, it certainly made me smile.

Yes my onco said similar, she said something about after 3 years they don\u2019t actually do a DEXA scan but something else, to be honest I sort of missed what she was saying which is unusual for me. I\u2019ve had 2 during my chemo and a third due in May then every 6 months for the total of 3 years. I\u2019ve read that some trusts won\u2019t authorise this treatment, so I\u2019m guessing we are lucky??? I wasn\u2019t aware it helped with recurrence, I just thought it was to help with bone thinning from the chemo. I think I will take a look at in more detail now my chemo is finished.  Im ER+ 8/8 so she said Letrozole is a must, I just can\u2019t face it at present, I need the chemo to be totally out of my system before I throw something else in as I\u2019ve been so poorly this time, plus with RT starting in 10 days I just want to have a bit of a break. I\u2019m sure another couple of weeks or so won\u2019t do any harm. Xxxx",

I was low intermediate area and my onco said the decision was mine and I just couldn\u2019t make that choice. My oncologist told me before the results were back that if the score was 25 or above then it would be down the chemo route anyway.  I paid for a further test called Endopredict which only gives a low or high score for recurrence as it\u2019s unavailable on the NHS and my results came back high. I decided to go ahead with chemo because of this and am having my third EC on Thursday.  I don\u2019t know about the horses or dogs but have cats and wasnt asked anything about having animals. I am super careful about cleanliness with them and everyone visiting me. I have hand gels everywhere and kindly ask everyone to use them when they come in and after using the loo.  I think if the decision is ours alone most of us would err on the side of not having chemo, Oncolgists train for years so I feel it really should be them deciding as then you can go into the future knowing that what you\u2019re doing is what they have told you is best for you. Only my opinion but for me to make that decision alone just wasn\u2019t an option I felt I could deal with.  I wish you the very best for the future Jacks xxxxxxx",

It\u2019s the lashes that have upset me the most if I\u2019m honest. I don\u2019t know about T as I\u2019m not having it but my onco told me it\u2019s the E bit that causes the hair loss so I\u2019m not sure if it continues on the T bit. The LGFB course was a pleasant afternoon with some lovely volunteers. It was more about applying make up normally with some really good tips rather than specifically for problems due to cancer treatment. Eyelashes weren\u2019t really discussed as such but I suppose it\u2019s hard to replace them with make up alone. You are given a really nice goodie bag to take home with all of the products you\u2019ve used which is so generous too. I\u2019ve found by putting a dark eyeliner very close to the lash line really helps and a darker shadow along the lid. My friend bought me a pre treatment pressie of an eye lash enhancer but on reading the instructions it said not to be used if having chemo. I\u2019ve had my last chemo so can start using it now and hopefully they will start growing back quickly. They did mention these products on the course today but do check you can use whilst having treatment. Hope you get a place on one soon Jackie xxxx",

I was so scared before I started my chemo but once you've done the first one it does get easier to face. The unknown can be a daunting prospect with many things in life especially something like this. Is there anybody that you can take with you on the 13th to make the journey a bit easier for you? Ring the helpline and just ask to talk to somebody, they understand and will help you get through this. Maybe go to see your GP as they may be able to prescribe something for you to help with the anxiety.

      "Content": "Dormouse Sorry to hear your back in hospital again. Exactly the same happened to me over the past week, A&E sent me home after IV antibiotics midweek. Back in again over the weekend but kept in as 2 different infections but not sure where, diagnosed as neutropenic sepsis. I was in isolation and to be honest with the goings on in a busy AMU I was actually relieved lol. As annoying as it is, you are in the right place and the IV antibiotics will keep those bugs from doing any further harm. I\u2018m home now but feel pretty pants, got to have a FBC done again on Tuesday as showing anaemia too but it\u2019s probably just another SE of chemo. Fortunately this was my last one so onwards and upwards and radiotherapy should still go ahead on Monday.  Hope they sort everything out for you very soon xx",

      "Content": "Sammystaff Hahahaha sorry as I said I was just thinking lol.  Ok so my head started itching uncontrollably at about 14 days on, I actually thought I had nits!!  I had it cut really short as the next bit was a really painful scalp, shorter hair sort of helped. My second chemo and that was it, it started just dropping out and the last lot was in the shower. So in total I would say all of mine was gone within 28 days of starting chemo.  I ordered some silk pillowcases from amazon with a cotton back to stop them slipping and they really help the scalp at night, cotton can be a bit rough. They are definitely worth buying, I think I got 2 for about £20 so swap and wash.  Also my wig lady recommended that I didn\u2019t shave my head as stubble is more troublesome when it\u2019s done too early. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t shave as I never went through the stubble phase, I just ended up with a smooth scalp.  Hope this helps Jackie xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Zebrano  Sorry to hear you\u2019ve been so poorly, I haven\u2019t put make up on for a while either. I\u2019ve had my last chemo and start RT soon so  have started thinking about a bit of normality and about making myself look and feel better. Yes losing lashes and brows does make a difference to how we look. For me it\u2019s definitely the lashes, I\u2019m sure there are tips out there on how to apply make up to make it appear they are there. I was hoping the LGFB course would have good advice on it, I\u2019m going on Monday afternoon so will share anything that may be useful for anyone that hasnt been on it.  Hope you\u2019re all having the best weekend possible xx",
