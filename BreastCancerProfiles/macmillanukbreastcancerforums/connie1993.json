    "Content": "Hi all, Diagnosed Brca 2 three weeks ago. Still no letter or any plan. I\u2019m 24, mum had BC twice, Aunty, granny (who died at 44 from bc, and dad with Brca 2 gene. Saw a consultant who told me I could have MRI scan, now I have been told I will not have any intervention or treatment until I\u2019m 30. I\u2019m very upset and anxious about this. No idea what to do, I wanted PBM to reduce my risk.  I\u2019ve been told \u2018I\u2019m too young\u2019 I don\u2019t know what to do, feeling lost alone and unsure of any options being told I\u2019m too young is discrimination and I feel I need to stand up for what\u2019s right for my health ",
