I felt again and it's a hard non movable lump in my right breast at the top deep under my nipple slightly. about size of a 50p. no pain. I thought I'd check the other breast and armpit and that's fine and squishy. I then checked my right armpit and discovered swollen lymth nodes to. so I have a solid lump in right breast and swollen lymth nodes in right arm pit. I know you can get lumps if menstrual cycle due or on. but I had mine end a week ago. also I'm not on the pill. I have the contraceptive implant in my arm which I've 2.3yrs now with no issues. I'm 26 have 2 beautiful children. youngest is 3. i breast fed both. honust opinions please. I know people will be kind not to worry me or upset. I'm ready to fight this battle if it is. many thanks x",

I found the lump on 28th dec. on 6th feb I had mastectomy as not enough clear margins to remove just the lump also started to spread to my nipple. also all lymph nodes removed as spread. I knew I'd be having mastectomy but plan was to have both off at end of treatment then reconstruct straight away. but now got to live with 1 boob till all treatment finished. I start chemo in about 4-6 weeks. got to see gyny first to see if want eggs harvested because of my age. my bone scan was clear. I'm er positive, and I had 7 lymph nodes in total and 2 were cancerous. I'm recovering well from mastectomy. my arm hurts the most but it's bearable. my scar is healed. it is hard when you have children as you worry about them but you will be amazed at how they cope and my children have been like little nurses lol. they are age 6 and 3. good luck. there's a group on facebook you should join. called 'younger breast cancer network (uk) secret group'.",
