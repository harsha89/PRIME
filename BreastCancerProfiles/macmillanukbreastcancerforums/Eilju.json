    "Content": "Hi Fiona  Like you it wasn't until the tax, that I suffered quite badly from side affects. During my 4th cycle I was admitted to EAU because of a high temp and an infection.  I had a water infection and swelling of the ankles, legs and knees and struggled to walk but I just had to persivere, then on 6th cycle high temp, fever and another infection and I was admitted again! Everyone reacts differently to the medication and you have to do what's right for you and listen to the experts. I have also gained weight and again this is just a side affect of all the treatment, so I do understand however you can concentrate on that area once you have recovered.  Sorry I'm unable to answer your main question, I am sure you will get a reply soon!  Be strong, I hope all goes well for you.  Best wishes    julie             ",
