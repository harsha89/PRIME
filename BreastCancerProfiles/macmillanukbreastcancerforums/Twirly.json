During my extensive tests to determine all aspects of my cancer(lung), I had several x-rays, a CT scan and a CT- guided biopsy, a PET scan (radioactive) and a bone-scan (ditto). Some of these were within days of each other. My cancer was removed by surgery, then  chemo, and after my last x-ray (12 January this year) there was no sign of anything nasty. And I don't glow in the dark, either! So don't be afraid, go for it! And I hope everything turns out to be ok for you. Love & hugs, Annie xxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Maggie, Don't panic! I had a PET scan before my lung surgery, to check for \"hotspots\" ( these are places of possible spread, which show up in red - as far as I can remember- on the scan). They will be looking for any signs of these on your ribs.  The procedure itself is pretty boring! You will have to drink loads of water beforehand, and then they will give you an injection of a radioactive liquid. After that you'll lie in a semi-darkened room, listening to music of your choice, for an hour. After that, you'll be scanned. It isn't a bit scary, just tedious. You are NOT enclosed, but you do have to lie still while the scanner moves from your feet to your neck very slowly. The nurse played me a Carpenters CD, which was just finishing as the scan ended. When it's over they advise you not to get close to any babies or small children for 24 hours, because of the radioactivity. And that's about it! You'll get the results a week- 10 days later, or at your next appointment, but you can always phone your BC nurse if you want to see if she's got any info. On my scan they found two \"hotspots\" - one on my elbow, which was a patch of eczema (the scan had picked up on the rapidly-dividing cells as it is meant to, but it can't differentiate between these and cancer cells. I'd been madly scratching it so it was red-raw!). The other was on my collarbone, but a subsequent bone scan found only \"wear and tear\", not cancer. So, to sum up - nothing to be afraid of, just go prepared for a nice rest! Take care of yourself, sending love & hugs, Twirly xxx",

I can understand about the stress, but I can assure you it is possible to stop smoking even though you're scared and tensed up. I had smoked 20+ a day for over 48 years but I was told I had to have stopped by 2 weeks before my lung cancer surgery, because of potential complications from the gunk hiding in the crevices of the lung. So with patches, gum, a lot of swearing and general grumpiness, I stopped. 21 months later and I'm still fag-free! If the patches and gum don't work for you, what about these new e-cigarettes? I've heard they actually give you a shot of nicotine, but none of the other ghastly chemicals the fag companies so obligingly put in cigarettes. And they work, apparently. They might help you to quit gradually. Worth a try? With love & hugs, Twirly xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there, Welcome to the place no-one wants to be, but where you'll find lots of support and will make good friends. Of course you have mixed feelings and feel afraid - it's such a shock when that kind of diagnosis comes out of the blue and you're otherwise fit and healthy. Everything whizzes through your mind at a terrifying pace and the \"what-ifs\" start to fall over each other in their race to dominate your thoughts. Writing everything down is an excellent way to deal with this. It does, as you say, help to put things in perspective - and to marshal your thoughts. You have a supportive partner too, which is great - you may need a bit of tlc if/when you have chemotherapy. Some people sail through it, but others find they get  tired, feel a bit sick, and generally lack energy for a few days afterwards. Having someone there to take any burden from you is a real bonus. My advice at the moment would be :DON'T GOOGLE! the results will undoubtedly be depressing, but more importantly, inaccurate because you are an individual, not a statistic. Instead, keep up-to-date with others here who are going through a similar journey to yours, that will be much more helpful and reassuring. If you are a generally well-organised person then you won't find that chemo sessions affect your day-to-day life too much except in the way I've already mentioned. It does help though if, before you see your oncologist, you make a list of all the questions you want to ask. Generally people are in such a state of anxiety at their appointments that they don't take in everything that's being said, and even if someone accompanies them, they may not recall every detail I do hope all goes well on the 17th. and that you'll get all the answers you need. Meanwhile, stay with us! Love & hugs, Twirly ",

Pretty unpleasant for a week or so, but tell your chemo nurse about the thrush and they will prescribe something for it, like Nystatin. Your taste will improve, though for a while after a chemo session everything has the texture of cardboard and the taste of metal, I found. Horrible! If you can tolerate things like strong soup, e.g. Mulligatawny or Oxtail, with some bread for dunking, it  will help to keep your strength up. Also, try & drink plenty of fluids. Some tips I was given for taking the nasty taste away: crystallised or preserved stem ginger, fresh or tinned pineapple. pear drops. You can also get high-calorie drinks prescribed if eating becomes a real problem. Two I know of are Fortisps and Fortijuice, and they come in various flavours. I hope this helps a bit. If you should be unlucky enough, like me, to get mouth ulcers as well, then again tell them and they'll prescribe Difflam, which is excellent. Good luck, and do come back here, you'll find lots of support. Love & hugs, Annie xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Claire, I know you'd rather not be here but welcome! You'll ALWAYS find someone to talk to here, and you can complain, rant, ramble or respond as the mood takes you. Did you know there's a \"LGBT Lounge\" here? It's only recently started but there are already several members. You might find it another source of support. Just enter LGBT Lounge in the \"search this site\" box, top right, and you should find it. This miserable (and typical) Bank Holiday weather doesn't do a lot for one's mood either, does it? But now you've joined this group of lovely ladies, I'm sure you'll begin to feel less alone. Family and friends can sometimes be worse than useless in this situation, and it's only people who are actually going through the same as you who will truly \"get it\". So, I'm sure someone will soon be along to chat with you. I'm in the Lung Cancer group myself (second time around, lucky me!) but I popped over here when I saw your post so you'd know someone cares. Chin up my lovely, and hang in there. Love & hugs, Twirly xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Flower, Weekends can be the pits! You've had some rotten experiences with men (and so have I!) but I agree with Kate, there are one or two decent blokes around who aren't just looking for a housekeeper they can *#%~ , but they do take some finding. My partner and I found each other 19 years ago via Channel 4's old dating service on teletext! I had to endure an awful lot of characters who hadn't bothered to read my details though, so were totally unsuitable, plus several cranks and one or two chancers. Never mind. water under the bridge now. Mine ain't perfect but hey, neither am I - by a long chalk - (anxiety & depression, social phobia, a dirty great surgery scar down my back, moody ... how long have you got?!). But the point I am slowly getting to is: don't clobber a new bloke with all the \"negatives\" you perceive you have! One of the men who replied to my details on the dating service was really articulate, well-read, very musical etc. BUT he insisted I should know all about his Multiple Sclerosis and associated problems, prognosis etc. This put me in an awful dilemma - the reason I decided he wasn't for me had nothing to do with his MS - it was all his name-dropping about people he knew that put me off. I felt too insecure to be able to cope with \"the high life\". I said I'd ring him some time but never did, and I was sure he'd have felt it was his MS. I still feel guilty to this day; but I didn't know how to tell him the true reason. So, next time you go hunting for a good guy, just remember you don't owe anyone an explanation of any sort. They take you as they find you, ok? If you hit it off, it'll be because there's a spark of genuine interest on both sides. Once that's established, and you feel comfortable with each other, then maybe you can think about \"confession-time\"! Just don't rush it, ok?  Love & hugs, twirly xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Patricia, Welcome to the club none of us wanted to join!  Of course you're feeling terrified and finding it hard to cope, this diagnosis is a dreadful shock and it can take a long time for your mind to get to grips with it all. I'm so glad you've got a loving partner, and I think your daughter is old probably enough to understand the basics. Macmillan has a very good free booklet on helping children whose relatives have cancer, so do give them a ring on the support line and ask. The number's free, available weekdays 9am - 8pm, and it's on the rhs of each page as well as under this post. Also, the Macmillan team of nurses are wonderful to talk to, so if you'd like a chat as well to help settle you, do ring them. Once you have a treatment plan you should find that you feel a bit more in control of things. When you first get the news, you feel as if your known world has ended and you've been cast adrift in a turbulent ocean. That will end, I promise you. You are among friends here who know exactly what you're going through and where you're coming from, so write down everything you're feeling, have a rant, cry, scream - it's all ok.  Hang in there, everyone will hold your hand through this. You are NOT going to die, ok? Sending love and hugs, Twirls xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Jenny, I was told exactly the same, after I'd had 4 cycles of adjuvant chemo (gemcitabine & cisplatin) following surgery to remove the bottom lobe of my right lung. It was the oncologist who mentioned it quite casually at my final appointment before signing me off from oncology & transferring me back to the Respiratory Clinic for follow-ups. I was flabbergasted - no-one had mentioned it at all, not even my assigned lung specialist nurse! I was left wondering what might have happened if I'd decided against having chemo. That was in September 2011. Every check-up since then has been clear, I'm pleased to say. I'm now on annual review, the next check-up being due in July. The doctor told me they would be checking my liver and brain at that time - scary or what?!!! However, I deliberately haven't Googled to find out what my chances are. I don't want to look at statistics or doom-and-gloom websites. I feel fine, am putting on weight (too much!) and am generally glad to be alive. I'm not even nervous about the July checkup. I'm 69, and 2 years on from diagnosis, and I intend to get to my 3-score years and ten,  so there! So Jenny my advice is - stop looking at those websites! Just carry on with your life, as there's no point dwelling on the \"what-ifs\". You'll drive yourself barmy with worry, and miss out on all the life you've got left, which will be a shame. Take care of yourself, and have a big grannyhug, With love, Twirly xxx ",

      "Content": "Hi Patricia, First of all, this feeling of isolation will pass, once you start treatment and meet other women who are going through it too. It can't help that your mother has gone and told everyone your business, but that can't be undone now; but I'm sure there will be people in your village who will genuinely feel for you and not treat you as someone \"just looking for sympathy\". Do have the flu jab, it will protect you when your immune system is compromised (assuming you will have chemo and/or radiotherapy). Have a word with your consultant on Friday, and if he agrees, arrange to get the jab asap. Losing your hair isn't the worst thing in the world, if it means you can be cured of cancer. You can have an NHS wig, which I'm sure they'll tell you about, and they are very good these days. Think of it as trying out a new hairstyle for a few months. There are headscarves and bandanas too - and I expect that in a Scottish winter you always have to cover your head when you go out anyway. By the time spring comes round you'll have new hair and a new lease of life. Try to ignore that old woman who says you're only looking for sympathy, she's being spiteful. I bet she wouldn't say that if she was the one with BC! Love & hugs, Twirly xxx ",
