    "Content": "Hi Crackered, I never ever come into this forum of wonderful folks, but your post did catch my eye. I am no expert but If this was a joint insurance to cover a joint mortgage then I would think it may be hard to overcome...... but as you say this is a \"Critical Illness Policy\" and will only be paid out on a diagnosis of a 'Critical Illness' so why not you take your 50% for your 'Critical Illness' and put the other 50% in a account and when he comes along with a medical report that says he has a \"Critical Illness\" he can get it....... or am i being cynical. All the best with this xx ",
