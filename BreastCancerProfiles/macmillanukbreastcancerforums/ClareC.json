      "Content": "Good evening all. On diagnosis I cut put all parabens, slsetc where possible and also stopped eating dairy, red meat, wheat, sugars etc and my blood count actually improved so I believe there is something in this change and whilst I am under no illusions that if will make anything improve, it ya something I feel I have control of. Green people is a good brand as well as faith in nature. Waitrose have started doing a \"yes to carrots / tomatoes / cucumber\" range of shower gels which are \"cheap\" compared to other free from products. I'm with suzie on the sanex deodorant but make sure it's the sanex zero. Simple products....do t be fooled they are not simple! Nivea pure and natural range is quite good! Good luck and it's amazing the other people you meet supermarket shopping when you start studying the labels! I was intrigued by a lady taking as long as I was and it transpired she'd had breast cancer, etc, etc, and us now fine :-) Big hug and in haste but keep smiling xxx",
