      "Content": "sue G Hi Callie 69 I had a delayed reconstruction after mastectomy chemo and rads. I opted for a LD reconstruction with implant to my left breast and another implant to my good right breast to match. Only one operation . Consider your lifestyle. Do you need to lift anything or play sports?  If so you may consider a tram flap and not LD recon. Your surgeon will discuss the options and it may depend on your body type and what your expectations are. My LD flap was very successful and looked good. After 7 years my implant has a capsular contracture and I am due to have the implant removed and replaced. Surgeon says I will be a day case. Knowing the NHS I will have to wait for this for months rather than weeks. Choose your plastic surgeon carefully.  I opted for one after recommendations from fellow breast cancer suffers.  My reconstruction was carried out in Birmingham. Sue xxx Hi Sue  I've had the same journey as yourself  I'm in the West Midlands also, can you message me your surgeon / hospital . Regards",

I had a double mastectomy with delayed reconstruction , I've had implants and tissue expanders which unfortunately have had to be removed due to infection,  my LD flap was also unsuccessful to build up a breast due to skin damage caused by radiotherapy, I'm now considering a fat trsnsfer , does anyone have any experience with this? ",
