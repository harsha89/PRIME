Having the daily stomach injections (finished Thursday) and developed the most awful backache which eased with Paracetamol and a heat pad. So all in all doing ok.

The first one I had really stung, so asked and was told to take it out of the fridge 30 mins before giving, this made all the difference. Gave them early evening. No aches until day 6 when I had really bad lower back pain. This eased with Paracetamol although the effects of that didnt last 6 hours, so used my heated wheat bag which was great. Backache went the day after my last injection. The really good thing is that the injections are spring loaded, and so once you have pushed the button the jab is given and the needle retracts, much better than having to push the plunger down yourself. You will be fine and who knows you may get brave enough to give them yourself, good luck  DDx",

But woke up the next day and I was fine. I get tired very easily, but just obey my body. If it says rest then I rest. I set myself small goals to achieve, Had a sore throat on day 5 again eased with Paracetamol, kept an eye on my temperature which was fine.  Seen the Oncologist this morning who is happy with how things are going. So as long as my bloods are ok on Monday I shall be having round 2 next Weds. Oh and my hair started to come out this morning but I was ready for that.  IF you have any questions just ask on here, there is no such thing as a daft question DD",

Make sure you take the afternoon dose before 4pm or you will definitely spend much of the night awake. Be prepared for the fatigue. Cant believe how tired i got but again that may just be me.

The worst bit for me was that they like to keep the area well heated for the first 12 hours post op so you are kept under what looks like a lilo with hot air running continuously through it...nurses were really great and managed to site it so it was just across my chest and kept the rest of my body clear. I had 2 drains in situ, one came out after three days the other after six. It took a few weeks for me to sleep on my left side (side I had the procedure on) but could sleep on my right side once I had the drains out, although it did pull a bit. You have to wear your bra day and night for six weeks which helped. Happy to answer anymore of your questions.",
