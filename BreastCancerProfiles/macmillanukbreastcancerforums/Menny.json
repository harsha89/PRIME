    "Content": "Hi Susie, I've just been diagnosed with cancer in my lymph node....they didn't find any in the breast, soÂ I was told I would have lymph node removal without breast surgery and depending on the results they will decide whether I will have chemo. I'm a BRCA1 carrier. Did you have chemo after your surgery and how quickly did you recover? Hope you are clear now!",
