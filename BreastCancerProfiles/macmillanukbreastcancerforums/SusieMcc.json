      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with BC in June 2014 and had a lumpectomy/node removal in July.  Oestrogen+, Node neg, Grade 3, clear margins.      Followed up by 4 weeks radiotherapy in Sept, left with horrible burns and now Letrazole. Struggling with lymphoedema in my breast and aches/pains/lumpy bits in my armpit, changes daily. Also found a new lump in the other breast, seeing Oncologist Friday 19th Dec.   Emotionally very down and tired with it all.  ",

      "Content": "Hi there, thanks for getting back to me.   So far I am not getting any support with the lymphoedema except that my GP gave me Furocemide to take, hasnt made any difference.    I live in Glasgow.  I am seeing my Surgeon on Friday so I will ask about it there and I have also found the email address for my BC nurse, so I have asked her advice too.  ",
