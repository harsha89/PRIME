    "Content": "Hi I have just had a WLE and SNB on Wednesday. During the surgery I went into anaphylatic shock when they injected the blue dye. They managed to get it under control and continued, As a result I was kept in overnight, but felt fine.  However, today I ache all over, the actual op site is fine, but my legs and other arm feel like I have been ran over by a horse. Has this happened to anyone else.  I just wondered if they had bruised me when trying to control the shock during the operation.   Thanks Yvonne",
