    "Content": "Hi Tania, If you do not get a referral before you see your onco I would definitely show the lump to her/him.  A lot of Ovarian onco clinicians also deal with breast cancer as often the two can be linked.  In fact I personally would insist while you are there they give you a mammogram and or an ultrasound scan if that\u2019s available at your hospital.   Hopefully it will be nothing at all but with your family history I am sure you being extra vigilant will catch anything early. I also would say you may wish to see a genetic counsellor too.   Keep up the good spirits, you will beat this.  Good thoughts and wishes xx S",
