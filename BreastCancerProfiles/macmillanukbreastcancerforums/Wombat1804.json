      "Content": "Hi. I\u2019m so glad you posted this. I\u2019ve finished my treatment now (apart from the tamoxifen and zoladex!) but I feel restless. I want something to change but I don\u2019t know what. I have no focus on anything. I work away during the week and go home for the weekend but I don\u2019t want to go back this weekend. I feel like I\u2019m trapped but it\u2019s only come on this week.  This is month 3 if the tamoxifen for me and so far I\u2019ve been lucky with side effects so I have no idea why I feel so strange. Best wishes to everyone Lisa",

Drove to hospital, struggled to park - no time to drink. This was day 2 of radiotherapy. Went back to work feeling like I\u2019d run into a wall I was so tired, had a complete meltdown and got sent home sick. I\u2019m lying in bed feeling sorry for myself. I won\u2019t make that mistake again.",

      "Content": "Hi. I\u2019d read about the side effects and was really worried about starting Tamoxifen but the main factor that convinced me to carry on was the fact that I credit it for keeping my mum alive for 30 years and I hope it does the same for me. I\u2019ve been on them for two months now and so far it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m carrying a bit more fat around the middle and I get a few hot flushes but it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as I thought.  I hope this has helped and I wish you all the best whatever your decision is.",
