      "Content": "Mum was diagnosed with breast cancer involving axilary nodes 2 months ago. Initially told mastectomy not possible due to her frail health. Staging CT shows nodes deep in central chest involved. Now referred to oncology specialist for chest and for anaesthetic assessment ref surgery option. Radiotherapy now suggested. Has anyone experienced chest node involvement? She has been increasingly short of breath over the last three to four months. As a nurse I can\u2019t stop investigating so am assuming the node inflammation is putting pressure on diaphragm/lungs. I\u2019m worried this will spread to her lungs but have no oncology experience of where this bloody disease tends to spread to when not in organs! Any input appreciated. X",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply KTatHome. I was a little despondent with no replies. I hope you are doing ok at the moment. Mum has been told that surgery is no longer an option and Radiotherapy is her only hope to prolong her life a while. I\u2019m now reading up on that!Â  Thanks again x",
