      "Content": "Hi Loubag Don't know if this is any help but in our very early thirties my husband was disabled overnight with MS.  Never had a symptom before.  I was a stay at home Mum to our 2 year old.  We'd been playing at property development and were in the middle of doing one house up.  Shortly after the economy crashed, interest rates went to 15%, our properties dropped in value and our mortgage was horrendous.  I suddenly was propelled back into the workplace. Working full-time as well as trying to look after a toddler and hubby, who by the way lost his job through his illness so no other income, was very difficult.  During that period we accumulated more debt.    It took a long time to get right but we did it.  If forced me to become much more active in my job and then career choices.    We used enjoy having sausages with a roast.  We couldn't afford to go out but we learned to make more of little things. We completely recovered financially  (and we've been very careful of debt since).  My husband never went back to work again but is ok.  We had another child, been very happy, paid the mortgage off etc. So in my long winded way I'm  trying to say not to worry.  Your treatment is temporary, you will recover and you can help restore financial security when you're better.    If there are opportunities for you to identify where you can cut some corners financially now then do so.    I managed to renegotiate some of our payments to help during that period.  Good luck to you and big hug to you and hubby during this testing time.",

However chemo and symptoms keeping you awake it's not surprising you might feel a bit gloomy.  Especially as the trial you are on looks like a tough regime.  However I'd really like to be having what you're on because I reckon that combination is going to be lethal for TNBC and will really kick it out of your system.   Those are effective chemicals and I'd feel much more confident that I wouldn't be seeing this cancer again.   Try and take as much help as you can get to get though it. I hope you wake this morning feeling better.   Big hug to you. X",

Has anyone else had to reduce like this?  Ideally I'd love to see pictures of people who are properly healed from this op, and WITHOUT tattoos hiding the result.  All the pictures I'm finding are ones not long after when the scars are still angry looking.

Ive been lucky. I'm now mourning the body I'm about to lose and getting in quite a state.  Even recognising I'm doing this to try and survive is not consoling me much. I'd be happy for a D or C cup but I'm not sure about less on me.  Being tall and broad seeing the outline of boobs feminises my shape - which is what I like. Sorry to ramble on so much.   ",

      "Content": "Hi all I haven't started chemo yet so that's not the cause.  I spoke to my plastics nurse who I'm seeing Friday and she said that if it was still a problem she might be able to arrange a physio but meanwhile to see my Dr. Upshot is I saw Dr this morning, who spoke to Oncology and I am now sitting in Oncology waiting for a MRI to rule out cancer as the cause.  Fingers crossed it proves to be muscle spasm.",

      "Content": "Desperately need advice.  I had a double mastectomy and DIEP about 9 weeks ago. However a couple of weeks ago I woke in the night with my back aching around the bra line.  Took some painkillers and went back to sleep. Fast forward and it's awful.  I get 2 hours sleep max.  It was easing off in the day but not so much today. I've tried my husband's Tramadol and Naproxen at night but they don't help.  Neither do Ibuprofen or Paracetamol.    I'm getting spasms so bad they make breathing and swallowing painful and I find myself crying out involuntarily, the pain is so bad.  Last night we were staying in a hotel after a wedding and I have spent most of the night on the bathroom floor trying out different exercises in an attempt to address it. I'm certain the solution will be exercises. Anyone else had this problem and have advice to offer please? I'm getting desperate.",
