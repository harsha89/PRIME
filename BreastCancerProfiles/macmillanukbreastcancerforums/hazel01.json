    "Content": "Hello, My names Hazel. I have breast cancer and have just been diagnosed with a small amount of secondary cancer on my lung too. I know many people on here must be going through the same sort of thing, I just thought I would join and perhaps it could be a place to chat. Its difficult when you feel you have to be strong and possitive all the time in front of people, I thought this might be a good place to discuss some of the fears. Sometimes, when Im alone particularly, I get an overwhelming panic inside. While im at work or with others I can think about other things. Im having trouble sleeping without taking sleep meds as I cant stop thinking about it.... Is it like that for everyone?",
