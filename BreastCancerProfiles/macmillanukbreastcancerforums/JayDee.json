      "Content": "Evening everyone, I have been on Tamoxifen for four years and I have just had a six week break from it, so blood tests could be done to check hormone levels plus other tests. Last time I had to have a break I was worried as it was like taking my security blanket away. However this time I have really noticed the difference, not only in the way I feel but also the way I think. I have felt so much clearer in my head and now blood tests have been done I am having to restart the tablets this evening. I am seeing the oncologist again in early June for the results. If I have gone through the menopause they want to change the tablets and will have to stay on them for a few more years. Has anyone else noticed the difference when they have had a break from the tablets? I have to say I am not looking forward to being medicated again and feel like I will lose me again in the fog of tamoxifen! I know it is a small price to pay, but the little voice inside my head says isn't so much nicer to feel like I did before the tablets.  Best wishes to everyone on their cancer journey wherever you are on this bumpy road.  JayDee x",

I feel that I am caught between a rock and a hard place but I wouldn't forgive myself if it came back and I don't think my family would either, so will have a chat with the oncologist when I see her next month. Although I know there is always a choice sometimes you feel as if there isn't. Big hug back to you JayDee x",

Just got to keep taking Tamoxifen for possibly 10 years, so 3 years done, 7 to go. Don't particularly like it but persevering.  Just been reading a good book called 'Your Brain After Chemo' which talks about the long term effects on brain function such as memory, concentration, word retrieval etc. Good to know I'm not going mad!! Hope you're ok too. Jay Dee X ",

I went for my fourth annual mammogram today after being diagnosed and treated back in 2012. I know I should be happy but I just have that horrible niggle at the back of my mind. I thought that this would have changed after all this time but it doesn't seem too. Even though I also go to the hospital for a check up every six months so I should be feeling ok. Apologies if this sounds as if I'm feeling sorry for myself. I'm sure I can't be the only one who feels like this?? JayDee",

      "Content": "Hi,   I had a lumpectomy and ten lymph nodes removed back in June. I went home the day after surgery and felt exhausted. I slept a lot at night and also had a nap in the afternoon. It\u2019s just a combination of the anaesthetic and also the emotional side of being diagnosed with \u2018c\u2019. Your energy levels will return but give it time and don\u2019t be hard on yourself.   As for the bra, I have been wearing the \u2018Ahh Bra\u2019 but other very similar style bras are available. Like you I only had underwired bras that I still haven\u2019t started wearing, mainly because I don\u2019t want the bra to rub on the site where the lymph nodes were removed.   My moods are still very up and down but as they say it\u2019s all part of the journey, even though like everyone one else, it\u2019s one you\u2019d rather not be on.   Take care and hope this is of some help Jean x",
