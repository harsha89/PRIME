      "Content": "toxophilite Spot on Carolyn28  This is chloecat45 's thread. Whether we agree with her choices or not - they are just that - HER choices. And she has had remarkable success up to now. I took everything on offer. Because I wasn't brave enough either. And for Hubby's sake. Hugs xx As per the quote above, this is Chloecat's post and I personally have been following her updates and read back to the start of the post as I too am looking into alternatives for various reasons... I personally as mentioned previously had sinus surgery after being bullied and frightened  into having it despite my own intuition that I didn't need it, I'm the end the \"experts\" with their years of training etc got it wrong, much like the \"experts that treated my dog considered he would not make in through the night yet he carried on another 6 months of quality time before needing to be put to sleep... Slightly different issue but I think all too often we hand over our lives to the experts in blind faith based on so called evidence... however no one solution works for all of us and of my choice currently to turn down invasive treatment which has the potential to weaken my immune system which was designed to help me fight disease and infections etc, that for me is my choice, I want to help my body heal and hopefully convert the rogue cancer cells my other means... I am however just 2 weeks into letrozole which is the least invasive in my opinion of the conventional out dated treatments on offer... We are each an  individual and I believe as such we each have the right to choose our own treatment rather than be forced down a route that does not have a 100% success rate, and causes our body massive shock..... Everyone on this forum I'm guessing has either had or been diagnosed or knows someone with breast cancer..... How we each react to this is up to us and I find it sad that so many people on this forum seem to be of the opinion that Chloecat should not be posting what is after all her journey after her diagnosis, she has not once suggested anyone else do the same as her and is just sharing the route she has taken on the path less travelled which is helpful to others considering that path too... For those brave people who have been down the conventional route and survived, I applaud you too for taking the route you felt to be in your best interests but please don't chastise someone who questions that this is the only option to heal from cancer... There are lots of alternatives out there and for those of us who prefer to take control over our treatment then yes they may or may not work, but in the end by documenting our progress or decline here that can help others make informed decisions for themselves rather than being pushed onto the cancer treatment conveyer belt without knowing what other possible solutions might be out there.... Please be open minded to Chloecat and any other people who are reluctant to hand their lives over to someone else without questioning... Chloecat I look forward to your further updates...",

      "Content": "Jobey, I must have missed the post that said any one person on this forum could dictate to another person on the forum how they chose to treat their own cancer in their own body?!? You as did many others here chose to deal with it in a certain way that does not have a 100% guarantee of success.... I am choosing to look at other options as is Chloecat which does not make you wrong for choosing what you want to do with your body nor does it make us wrong to choose our way forward... Sorry that so many people feel that your way is the only way, it worked for you but not everyone wants to take that path.... Chloecat is looking at other options and generously sharing those options with other people who like to have control over what happens to their body rather than just rolling over and saying to the authorities.. \"Here is my body,  you cut burn and poison the cancer out  of me and at the same time do severe damage to rest of my body......\" Well I'm not choosing that for my body, I'm helping my body through less invasive conventional treatment combined with nutrients known to fight cancer cells but support the rest of the body... I'm not saying anyone here is wrong for making the choices they made for THEIR body so please don't tell me what I should or should not do with mine please....... ",

I'm still taking lipasomal vitamin C as the best way to get it into your body safely.... There are various brands out there and I prefer the one offering 1450 a dose mostly because it's a formula easy to take as you just drink it.... I take magnesium but will check if chelated as helps with leg pain from letrozole and assists me to get to sleep!! Thanks for the update and great you get a free follow up test!!  ",

      "Content": "Tropicof,  The problem is doctors receive very little training in nutrition so don't have a clue about why alternatives so can only recommend what they are experts in ie conventional treatment for cancer....  The book I mentioned in my quote is very well researched and written by a top British nutritionist who makes the book very readable with lots of different dietary advice which has been proven scientifically.... It is also recommended by a British Oncologist...........  I am following her guidance and there is so much we can do to change our lives to help beat cancer naturally.... She is however advising that the advice should be followed to prevent breast cancer or stop recurrence after treatment....  I am using it alongside Letrozole..... Mostly so I have some control over trying to heal my own body and build my defence up to prevent recurrence....  I am transitioning to raw vegan from other research and personal experience from when I did it previously and it gave me a multitude of health benefits...  But her book and dietary advice is for simple things you can add to your food intake including cooked foods and things to avoid and why... All backed up by science including cutting out sugar.... Good luck ",

      "Content": "So agree with the last couple of comments, we do have at least one thing in common, cancer.... As individuals in a mostly democratic society, we are fortunate enough to have conventional treatment available freely to us on the NHS and for some of us here that has been the path chosen as that has resonated with us or felt the only thing to do... However there are others here on this forum looking at different ways to deal with cancer and from what I have seen Chloecat is a pioneer in that area.... Ladies as someone said cancer effects us and our lives in different ways and this site and mods are very open hearted and caring for all of us and understanding how much an online support system can help especially emotionally when cancer is not easy to come to terms with... I am almost a month on letrozole now and have had a few side effects taking me off work due mostly to fatigue and nausea but I will persist with the treatment alongside boosting my immune system in various ways to support it in dealing with the cancer... I can't get my head around why some of those that chose conventional treatment are so aggressive towards those of us choosing to incorporate some non-conventional treatment into our battle with cancer..... Nobody has the right to tell another person who is suffering from any kind of illness that they should deal with it this or that way.... Only that person should have the ultimate right to deal with disease in their own body.... There is an old Native American saying along the lines of ... \" Never judge a person until you have walked in their moccasins\"... I think it is pretty fitting here...... At the end of the day, we are all here for the same reason, to give and receive support to each other when coping in whatever way we choose with cancer... I don't recall Chloecat or anyone else condemning anyone for taking the purely conventional route, so taking into account another saying \"treat others as you would like to be treated\" hugs and bunnies are more preferable to be shared amongst us... I would have added a photo of my Ginger cat but can't work out how lol .... Peace and understanding to everyone here especially our patient and fair mods.... ",

I am going on for my first check up tomorrow since they broke the news to me on 1st August about my stage 1 slow growing breast cancer and so far the only conventional treatment I'm taking is letrozole... I am taking a lot of supplements some of which I read about on your posting. I read your last update and I am thinking that you were prescribed a chemotherapy drug without your knowledge that it was that?! If so that is awful!!! Even worse if you are part of a trial again without being made aware of it or asked your permission...  I really hope you can get some clarity on your next visit!! Good luck with your treatment and protocols in the future...  Big hugs to you Elaine Xx",

I certainly have nothing but admiration for those ladies who have undertaken conventional invasive treatment for breast cancer.. I'm just saying it's not for me as I prefer a more holistic approach to helping my body fight the rogue cells rather than another approach which involves harming my body in an attempt to heal it... At this point in time the original Hypocrates Oath springs to mind... \"First Do  no harm\"..... Sadly conventional treatment does do harm.... Long may we all live in harmony with each other and our bodies and have the freedom to heal them in whatever way best suits us as individuals... I respect everyone here who chose conventional treatment so please extend the same respect to me and others on this forum, remember years ago everyone thought the world was flat!! ",

      "Content": "Hi Chloecat,  I have just finished reading your entire post, all 16 pages of it with great interest! Sorry to hear about your mini stroke too and I hope you are recovering well from it.  It is so strange as reading your early posts especially was like reading my own post on the breastcarecancer forum or something like that...  I too on getting diagnosed with BC have declined virtually all conventional treatment, ie surgery chemo and radiation but have decided alongside some dietary changes and looking into alternative therapies preferably non invasive, to have the hormone treatment ie Letrozole starting in  a week or so..  Out of many less encouraging responses to my  post, one kind lady suggested I register here as she has followed your post since you started in 2012... It was so comforting to read both your post with your humour, and regular updates as well as some supporting responses from several ladies here too...  I am on largely raw vegan and transitioning to total raw vegan once my freezer is empty of food that needs cooking! , I have the book of Gerson therapy but found it heavy going and currently taking tips written by a British Nutritional expert and endorsed by an Oncologist called \"Take Breast cancer off your menu\"....  I am so pleased that you are doing so well and sticking with your convictions and belief that some of the more aggressive cancer treatments are not necessarily suited to everyone...  I only got diagnosed last Tuesday but they had strong suspicion of cancer when I had my biopsy the previous Tuesday (hurt like hell even with local anesthetic!!) still but a bruise over a week later...  I read with added interest your posting detailing your supplements and ordered the 2 I had not tried yet...  Thank you so much for being brave and looking into other options for cancer treatment, as on the other forum the women who have gone through conventional treatment and survived that and happy with  the lives they now live are to be admired also..  I believe cancer and how it should be treated is an individual thing, and don't believe \"one size fits all\" so to speak,..  I need to go back to see my oncologist on 1st Nov for a physical check up, then another US 3 months after that....  One of my interests other than nutrition is the Bob Beck protocol.... Considering buying the equipment that is the basis for it....  Take care.... You're not alone!!  Elaine Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Suzie,  When I was given my diagnosis I was kind of told that they would make an appointment for me to have the cancer surgically removed in accordance with their recommendations based on my diagnosis which was basically stage 1, slow growing breast cancer followed by radiation although chemotherapy was not mentioned to me at that time.  I told the surgeon I didn't want surgery, radiation or chemotherapy but from research I had done myself prior to the diagnosis I asked if my  cancer was ER which they confirmed it was and asked me if I would consider hormone treatment which I said I would consider if they could tell me more about the drug they would use... I was given a leaflet about it and asked to call my breast care nurse within 2 days stating if I wanted to start it in which case they would write to my GP to prescribe it for me...  In order to make the best informed decision I asked work if I could have 2 days emergency leave so I could research the pros and cons of letrozole which was the drug they were offering and I decided I would try it alongside diet and lifestyle changes to give myself a better chance of successfully beating the cancer....  I have to go back for a check up on 1st Nov followed by another US around 1st Feb at which point depending on the results I might review my options..  Hope that helps...  Suzie W Hello Winterwolfsoul I haven't followed your treatment as I am new on the forum but I was interested to read that you are on Letrozole which you mentioned was least invasive. I am not sure what your cancer is but wanted to know whether you were first offered something more invasive but you got something less invasive? Were they both offered to you? Could you please explain how you managed to have a less invasive form of chemo.... thanks Suzie ",
