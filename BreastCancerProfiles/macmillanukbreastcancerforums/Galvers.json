    "Content": "Hi If you are able to read back far enough on this thread you'll see links to articles on fasting and chemotherapy or you can google them.  Many of us who do fast were initially interested from reading the Guardian blog by Decca Aitkenhead on how to survive chemotherapy. First part of article is about getting a human hair wig (which I can recommend highly but you don't need to pay the price she did - mine cost £650 - through specialist wig supplier, cutter and fitter), but the second is about fasting and gives you an oversight of her experience and her summary of some evidence.  I then looked up the articles and read them and decided it was worthy it given a) fasting appears to target healthy cells far less as they hunker down into repair and protect mode which the cancer cells can't do. Evidence to date shows this zaps the cancer cells much more efficiently. B) because the healthy cells are in repair and protect mode the after effects of chemo are less severe apparently. I'm on FEC-TH. just completed third FEC and will be starting on T (docetaxel) next time plus herceptin. Ive fasted for just short of 72 hours before and 24 hours after. I have not fasted before. I drink lots of fluids each day to keep me full up. On occasion I've felt a little light headed and have eaten a piece of fruit. Just be sensible really. It's a choice after all. My oncologist didn't mind if I did it but said he couldn't advise it as full human trials not reported yet. I asked if fasting would affect blood cell count and he said no. So...I've gone ahead. A lot of the dr and nurse reactions are because they're ignorant about it and the evidence to date. My lovely chemo nurses have never heard of it so I've told them what I know. As for my side effects I have had some so who knows if it would be better or worse if I didn't fast. Generally first 4-5 days very sleepy and nausea bad day 1-2 (but that improved once oncologist prescribed better nausea meds..and gp! By end of week 1 of cycle I'm doing pretty well. And by week 2 I'm just tiring a bit earlier of an evening. By week 3 I'm working again. Sorry for long post. Just wanted to give my experience and share what I read.",
