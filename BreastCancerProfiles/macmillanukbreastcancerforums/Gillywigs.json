      "Content": "Hello. This is the first time I've even visited this site let alone written anything, but having read your question I had to respond. I'm 48 and its a year this feb 28th for me too since I had a double mastectomy and lymph nodes removed. And I feel just like you do. My husband is wonderful too. He's caring and not demanding of anything at all but in a way that almost makes it worse as it makes me feel even more c**p than I already do. I have 2 girls who have been lovely and none of them expect anything of me, but I just feel like I'm letting them all down all the time. I have no motivation to do anything and my only feelings are negative ones. I hate my body, I had a hysterectomy a few years ago too so I'm a bit of an empty shell really and that's exactly how I feel. Empty!! Most days I feel like I wish I'd not had treatment and let it just finish me off because it would have been easier than this \"life\" I have now. How ungrateful does that make me sound! I'm just not coping emotionally at all. But so far I've been unable to talk to anyone about how I feel. I can't talk....literally. If I try I just cry and then I can't get anything out. Most people I know don't ask me how I am they tell me. They tell me I'm looking great and that my hairs growing back so well. They tell me how well I'm doing but they don't know the truth because they don't ask. I don't seem to be able to see a way out of this downward spiral that my life has become. Before cancer struck I was an enthusiastic person who loved life and worked hard. But it has destroyed me. ",
