      "Content": "Hi It might be an idea to join the monthly chemo threads....I am sure some bright spark can send you a link!  I had FEC -T and am now out the \u2018other\u2019 side....reactions vary....i found FEC okay, not great but okay!  I had plenty of anti sickness meds and made sure I got plenty of sleep. I found T harder...maybe because i was already tired and the effects are cumulative. I had quite a lot of pain in my legs but mentioned it to my nurses and they sorted some better pain relief. My advice is to take each day as it comes, keep a close eye on temperature and if your wife is at all concerned ring the hotline number you are given. Tell your breast nurse or chemo nurses any side effects... Stock up on tasty soft drinks....squashes, tonic etc....I found water tasted horrible! Tasty snacks too...as taste buds go to pot! I think you\u2019ll find sweet stuff tastes nicer....I kept frozen pineapple chunks and mango pieces in the freezer. The monthly chemo page on here is really good and whilst everyone is different, I found it helped to know I was not alone. Chemotherapy is hard and I am still recovering but it is doable....and the thread gives loads of hints and tips. I am sure there is a hints and tips page somewhere too....again I am sure one of the super duper Champions will soon point you in the right direction. Wishing your wife minimal side effects.....",

One thing I have noticed is while you might feel tired one day the next day you feel fine. If you have some flexibility in your work that would help....some days you will feel absolutely fine and others you might feel under the weather....and to be honest that sort of sums up my experience. Each day varies...make sure you take the medication offered...I take anti sickness even I feel a little dodgy rather than wait til I feel ill....get some paracetamol in just in case!  And if you feel tired...rest!

Please go to the doctor about your concerns, I have always found my gp understanding when it comes to checking out lumps and bumps. i have a family history of bc, aunts on both sides. My mum died of non Hodgkins in her 40s so not sure if she would have had it too! I was referred to a genetics clinic by my doctor and from that I was referred for annual mammograms (I was early 40s). Unfortunately I have subsequently been diagnosed with bc...not seen in mammogram. So my advice is...if you have any worries about lumps that appear...please go and see you gp. ",

      "Content": "Hi You have taken the first step in being able to help...there is lots of information on this site and many experiences that can be shared. I had the same type of cancer as your mum, I was diagnosed in June last year so am 8 months into treatment and finish active treatment this week. It is not unusual for information about the cancer to change following the operation - mine did and I too had to go for scans to see if it had spread ( which it hadn\u2019t) I have to say this is probably the most stressful time - the waiting and the unknown - once your mum has a clear idea of what is happening next and the treatment starts...then you manage on a day by day basis. One thing I have learnt is that everyone is different eg their side effects and how they cope. It is useful to take each day as it comes.  I have found my GP/nurse very helpful and I would suggest she makes an appointment to see them...building a relationship may help particularly if she hasn\u2019t really needed to use the doctors much in the past. There may be a support group locally or at the hospital that can also support if you or your sister cannot be there... Timing wise I really don\u2019t think it matters if you go privately as there are guidelines in place through the nhs. I went privately but only as I was covered, Tming is often dictated by your recovery times from operations or chemotherapy rather than availability. Others on this site might be best able to give an insight into nhs or do a search as I know it has been discussed on here before. I hope that helps and I wish your mum all the best.",
