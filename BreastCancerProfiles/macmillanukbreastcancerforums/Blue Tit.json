      "Content": "Hi Patricia Your dog comments made me laugh. We have a 3 1/2 year old minature Jack Russell & she still messes indoors - drives me insane. We toilet her just before bedtime. She sleeps in her bed in the lobby area, next to a nice warm radiator, & she messes or pees most days. If I don't move the door mat she uses that! I've now given up & put newspaper down for her but she doesn't always use that either - I give up. Last summer we bought a kennel & had her staked on a long lead in the garden overnight. She didn't mind (we put a huge teddy in the kennel for her to cuddle up to). I thought that would have got her out the habit, but no. Just as well we love them aye! Good luck xxx",

This cancer thing makes you feel so ancient it's good to be coming out the other side sticking 2 fingers up at it! My undies fitted well (I'm usually an M&S girl) so you should be ok. As I said before, I saw some lovely mastectomy undies online at Debenhams, but I'm an average 36C & they didn't have any in my size ;(. They were a good price too. I've found most mastectomy sites very expensive, but was lucky and got my swimming costume in a sale & it was the last one & fitted beautifully. And a boobie beanie to swim in too. The hair sounds great, mine is only about 1cm at the mo & very grey so I am envious. How long was yours before the cut & colour? Mine has been growing for nearly 4 months & I'm hoping to have a pixie cut by August. You best prepare your other half for a romantic evening - you go girl! But don't forget .... Beauty comes from within & you are already one beautiful woman. Have Fun!! Much love xxx",

The amount of visits to the hospital before treatment starts is amazing and could be a real drain on finances if things are tight to start with. 2. Help at home post operation / chemo. If my husband hadn't taken so much time off work I don't know how I would have coped. We live rurally & driving my son to & from school, driving miles to & from work & fitting in all the shopping, cooking & cleaning etc was no mean feat. I spent many days on my own post Taxotere just managing to get down the stairs & making a cup of tea & didn't phone the chemo hotline as there was no one to take me if they had said come in. (Yes I do have friends & family but they don't live close by or they work). 3. Massage/ reflexology etc. when stressed out & feeling poorly I would have loved something like this to take the edge off but at £50+ a time & not entitled to sick pay it didn't happen. I raised it with the Onc nurse once but nothing happened. I have a very supportive husband & hate to think what it must be like for people on their own without family nearby & friends available to help. I hope this helps Dorothee. Xxx",

However you may find getting things over your head difficult so ensure they are lose or button or zip front. It was 3 weeks later when I had the ANC that things got tricky. Beware of 'cording' and ensure you exercise your arm - it's a bugger! I was in overnight only for both ops so if you are in 4 nights the drains should be out before your are discharged. I remember showering with an adapted Sainsbury's bag over my wound & sitting in the bath with my son's Lego boxes piled up beside me with the drain resting on them! The BCN's gave me a floral tie bag for the drain & I pinned it to my gown which gave me free hands. I have had no problem whatsoever with the MX wound, healed really nicely, just a small amount of fluid which got drained once & antibiotics just to be on the safe side. I have been left with a tiny bump of breast and when I wear tops it still looks like I have a cleavage. I asked the BCN if this was done on purpose but she said more by luck. I have bought those new stretchy sports type bras with the pockets & my spongy boob fits in them well & I have worn nothing else. I have only worn my jelly prosthesis once, I find it much heavier. Don't do what I did and contort myself to get bra top on & fully dressed to go home. After the 2nd op in 3 weeks I walked to the car in my PJs & gown ( new black ones I might add)! No one batted an eyelid & I was comfortable & went straight to bed when I got home. Very best wishes to you. Xx",

I had one macromet & one isolated tumour cell so they did an ANC, I was gutted but apparently it's new research that shows these minute cancer up so really I am lucky! Hoping you are lucky and yours are clear, especially after the chemo. My lobular cancer was large so they just went straight in with mastectomy. I must say though, I didn't really understand why I had the 'bubble test' where they took another 3 painful biopsies, then the sentinel node & a few others removed, then the 2nd op. thought the bubble test was to see whether you had them all out or not?? I say thank God for mammograms or I wouldn't of had a clue & it had obviously just started to spread to nodes. Hope this helps. Xx Good luck Nikki too xx",

No Xmas shopping! I'm only just feeling like the old me (on a good day)! Seeing GP Mon & not sure what she'll say about returning to work (I only work PT now after being made redundant in 2011). Some days, now, I'm full of confidence, hope, energy & others I don't want to leave the house & wonder how I can return to work. I think it's only now that we can take stock of the roller coaster ride we've been on; & some days the enormity of it hits us. I'm trying to allow myself several weeks to 'convaless' & get back into the swing of things. Not too much to ask is it! So be kind to yourself. Xxx",

If I were you I'd phone them direct & make enquiries. They were helpful to me & rang & suggested I needed a different size knicker to match a mastectomy bra I'd ordered. I was very pleased with my undies. To be honest when I put my mastectomy swimsuit on, as it is black across the bust, you had to look hard before you realised I was lopsided. But I knew I was & that mattered to me. Hence the beanie. You can purchase proper swim prostheses but on all the sites I've seen they are expensive. Although someone commented that their BCN gave them a swim prostheses too. So maybe ask? Must admit I've been shocked at how expensive mastectomy swimsuits can be on some sites. I'm an 'average' 36C & most are out of stock in this size. Debenhams on line had a wonderful selection of mastectomy bras & not one available in my size! Good prices too. I decided 'I'm worth it' in the end & treated myself on other sites ;0) Hope you find something suitable - good luck xxx PS. George @ ASDA are apparently now selling a mastectomy swimsuit at a very reasonable £12 - some reviews rave about it, some say it doesn't offer much support. But for anyone on a budget & not working at the moment it's an option.",

I was told they are obliged to operate within 30 days of full diagnosis & that fell true for me. Apparently they get a much better view of the cancer from the MRI before they operate & know what they are dealing with. Then of course you have to wait for the histology of the tumour. The BCNs told me that the cancer didn't grow that quickly & not to worry. At least you have the reassurance afterwards that the tumour is contained. Be prepared to lie face down in the scanner & take a distracting CD for them to play for you. They really do work hard on getting an accurate diagnosis in order to give you an individually tailored treatment plan. Good to hear you are thinking positively, I believe that helps our recovery. Fingers crossed & best wishes xx",

There is some thought that radiotherapy would be unnecessary, especially as I had FEC-T. I went to see consultant radiologist & nurse to get full details - consultant wanted me on trial ( although a copy of his letter blatantly said I didn't really need it) & nurse told me lots more negatives of treatment. Mine would have been left side & I was worried about possible damage to heart & lungs. Plus I didn't realise you can only have it once, so if I got a recurrence in the future & I'd already had radiotherapy (maybe unnecessarily) I wouldn't be able to have it then. So I made up my mind not to have it & I'm glad after chemo that I didn't (at this point). They put me on Metformin trial & I was happy to do that (but that's another story & my body is not tolerating the drug but it has huge pluses in preventing recurrence) . Whatever you decide good luck. I think it's a personal choice but if you feel you want/need it then fight for it. Best wishes xx",

You must tell your Onc as they will probably lower yours. I'm now 11 weeks post FEC-T & still have numb fingers & toes although it is getting better VERY gradually. My feet used to go totally numb when I was walking! GP says tips of fingers may always feel a bit numb. However she did say is no better in a few weeks she'll check my Vit B12 levels & maybe prescribe something to help. On a brighter note I now have a covering of 'baby' hair, albeit salt & pepper in colour & I've just noticed that I now also have some eyebrows too, but alas no eyelashes yet. So it is doable & things do get better. Best wishes xx",

I applied for ESA was turned down but they sent a huge form for me to complete so I rang them & they said they'd changed their mind! Then because of cancer diagnosis they put you into their 'special group' & up payments to £105 per week. It did take around 3 months before I got any payments though. They reviewed after a while and another huge form to complete but then they said they didn't even want to see sick certificates, but obviously my employers did. So don't always be put off immediately, sometimes you have to push. And if you've worked hard & paid your taxes all your adult life you're entitled to it. Good luck xx PS.

Not a huge amount but every little counts! Don't forget to get a form from your GP to get your medical exemption certificate for the next 5 years - you'll be amazed how many lotions & potions you may need in the future & prescriptions are expensive. Enjoy the boxing as you won't be doing that for a while after surgery. I too have realised that it was better I wasn't in a job I no longer enjoyed & zapped my energy & strength. I may no longer earn so much but am more relaxed & enjoying life & taking time to stop & smell the roses for a change. As you say, sometimes things happen for a reason. The MacMillan team can also provide you with information on financial help so give them a ring. Best wishes to you. ((Hugs)) xxx. PS.

I was also told that this type of cancer is hard to detect as you don't have a 'lump' as such - it is more like deep down hardening of tissue; I beat myself up for a time thinking I should have noticed earlier but it really is best to put all your energies into kicking cancer's butt! I too am based in Kent & for the type of recon you want they refer you to the McIndoe centre at East Grinstead hospital where the specialists are. I'm currently waiting for my appointment. I was made redundant not long before my diagnosis & lost my private medical cover, but to be honest the NHS has been great & their guidelines are to operate within 30 days of full diagnosis. I'm sure you will get your MX done ASAP then you will have time to think about what you will have done & where best to be referred. Best wishes xxx",

I finished chemo end Nov 2012 , (MX June & ANC July 2012). 3 month Onc check Oct, (few questions & an examination) and got 1 yr check (mammogram) through for mid July 2013. However, I pushed for referral for recon & got an April appt with breast surgeon. Slightly alarmed when I got called through for a mammogram, questioned this but was assured, yes, I was to have one. Saw Dr & was told they decided as I was there they'd bump my 1 yr check fwd so I got it 1 yr from diagnosis rather than last op. So I got the mammogram, questions & an examination of the mastectomy area & other breast & told all clear. I must say at this point I felt 'is that it'? How do they know its gone? However, I'm on a Metformin Trial & get regular checks for this too & had one a week ago. They took 10 phials of blood, asked questions & I got a very thorough examination from the research doctor. She felt my clavicle & neck too. I felt much more reassured when I'd left that I was all clear. I think they can tell a lot from blood results as to if there is something going on inside. They have now bumped my next Oncologist check from Oct to Dec to coincide with the research checks so please don't be too worried & ask for your appt to be moved away from the Xmas period if this is upsetting you. Meantime, you can always call your BCN if you have any worries. I must admit if I've had any other niggles I now go straight to GP, just in case. Please try to stop worrying as I truly believe that a positive mind helps us along our path. Hope this info helps you, even a little. Please do phone & re-arrange your appts if it takes away some stress. Take care Hugs xxx",

My GP is very tough about signing sick certificates but the benefits dept rang me and told me to ask my GP for x 2 lots of 3 month sick certificates ( from date of op onwards; takes a good time before it comes through) - I questioned it & they said due to BC they put you in the 'seriously ill' category. So I did what they asked & GP did as she was told! She also told ATOS not to call me for assessment as chemo wasn't that type of illness. GP has extended them since & I hope to return to P-T work in the not too distant future. Also once Benefits put you in their 'seriously ill' box they enhance the SSP. It's not the same as your salary but every little helps. They also told me they didn't want sick certs anymore but I have had to complete two huge forms. However work still require the sick certs. Don't be bullied into working when you feel truly awful. I was expecting to work on good days but my manager was horrified when I mentioned it. So I went along with what I was told & feel I have benefited from it & given my body time to heal. Best wishes & take care of yourself. Xx",

Really good to hear from you. Take care . Much love to all you strong ladies especially you, Winston, SaxxyD, Ethel, Dorethee, Mother 47 et al. Xxx",

I sent SaxxyD a PM recently updating her on my consultation with the plastic surgeon but not sure she received it. Anyhow just wanted to wish you well in The Race for Life. Take care xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ethel, so you are on the real thing after all, I'm so pleased as I remember you saying you wished you were but didn't think so as you had no side affects. I presume as you are having more surgery they had to find out if you had to stop medication or not? I had an horrendous time & am obviously on the real thing. I was home bound for a while & had to stop it for a month & am now just on half the daily dose, which my body can tolerate. If I'm going out I don't take my Metformin until I get home as it can still have an effect on my digestive system. I tried to get them to give me Metformin Slow Release which is coated & doesn't have this effect but they won't as its not part of the trial. My GP was very supportive. If the trial has a positive outcome I'm sure she'll prescribe it for me (I think it's x 3 times expensive though). Keep us up to date with how you get on. Take care xxx",
