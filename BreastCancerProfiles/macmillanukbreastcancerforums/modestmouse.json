      "Content": "Five years after cancer and at my latest checkup consultant doesn't even bother to see me, just get handed piece of paper saying keep taking tamoxifen for another 5 years! I don't want to . I want to stop now. I feel I have been under informed during the whole process. I was never given an option to refuse chemo but I would have if they had given me the statistics before rather than after treatment. Now I've developed lymphoedaema and the nurses never answer the phone so no help with that. Really fed up",

      "Content": "Thanks misteymole. That's what I needed to hear.I'm not crazy, I've taken it for five years and had enough of the horrible side effects. My biggest fear is there will be a 'we told you so' attitude if the cancer comes back. It may come back with or without tamoxifen. There's plenty of research on the internet, five years used to be enough. Now it seems there is a small difference if you take it for ten years. Thank you so much",

      "Content": "I did try and discuss it. The doctor who was seeing me went off to see 'the boss' and came back with a simple no, no statistics or options. I don't know his reason for being so non negotiable. I've been thinking about it whilst out walking dogs if I make a deal with myself about improving my diet and meditating more it seems like a fair trade off. I'm a nurse and I've seen enough doctors get it wrong to know their judgement is not infallible. Probably got the lymphoedaema because gp refused to give me antibiotics when I practically begged for them, although I've taken plenty since that initial refusal. Sorry to sound so negative but I think I'm done with conventional medical advice",
