      "Content": "This thread and its content has given me a little to think about, it seems to me that if you put your faith in the hospital and sciences and state the fact you don't find religion or religious comments very helpful this is wrong in some way and comments of this kind should be confined to the Atheist Group. Surely this is wrong on at least two counts. 1) It's prejudicial towards none believers as their views are not welcome in mainstream discussion. 2) By sending the comments off to the Atheist Group you are only preaching to the already converted so might as well not bother at all.   Just a thought.   Kev...    ",

      "Content": "Hello cellogirl. Firstly I'm not trying to scare the hell out of you but please get your problem investigated further, I saw two GPs, the first treated for external piles, the second sent me for tests, walking, sitting, passing motion and wind gave me the worst pain imaginable, unfortunately I was diagnosed with Anal cancer which is quite rare but i was lucky as my second GP must have had previous experience of this. Anyway on to the bit you are intrested in I have not been free of pain since feb, in the end it was the radiotherapy team helped me just 3 weeks ago, what you need is something called Intrasite and Instillagel, as I understand it one is a carrier to help it stay put and the other a local anasthetic used for inserting instruments and the like into to what may be painful places. You have to blend the two together in a 50/50 mix, but sadly have to find your own way to apply mix to the area. I hope that helps you and anyone else with similar problems that may read this thread. Take care, all the best, Kev...    ",
