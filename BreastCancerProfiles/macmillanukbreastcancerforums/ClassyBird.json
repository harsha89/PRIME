    "Content": "Hi Shaz, I had something similar to this, the underneath of my upper arm felt hot then cold then pins and needles, then just numb, then sometimes like cold water was running down it, then stinging like it was burned, then not like my arm.  I was told at the time that it was nerve damage and the best thing I could do was desensitise it by massaging it.  You need to be very careful with direction and strength of massage due to the removal of lymph nodes so make sure you get some advice before trying it.  I saw a lymphodemea specialist who showed me exactly what to do and how to avoid doing any damage.   Xxx",
