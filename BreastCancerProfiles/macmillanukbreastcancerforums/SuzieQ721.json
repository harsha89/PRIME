      "Content": "Hi I have been having the Zoladex for 12 months.  Yes I am being referred re ovary removal which I am fine with as I don't need them anymore lol.  I am lucky in that I have a very good nurse so whilst I am in having one injection she orders the next one.  Have asked about the 3 monthly one but they don't like to do that round my way.  Can't remember why now but so long as I get it that's fine by me. Memory problem is a pain.  I do exactly the same.  Start a sentence then part way in the rest of it just vanishes off into the either hence why still not back to work.  I have a responsible job in finance and basically can't afford to get that wrong or more importantly be lying away at 2 in the morning worrying about that as well. Actually got 5 hours sleep last night - bliss.  I have been given some sleeping tablets but only like to take them if I really have to.  Not being at work gives me the luxury of being able to nap throughout the day as necessary. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi.  I was diagnosed last year with bc and bone mets. I was only 52 at the time.  No ops as it had already spread. Was put on Zoladex and Letrazole - which I took for about 10 months then due to side effects changed to Examestane so not everyone has tamoxifen. Hope this helps. If you want to know anything else just ask. Sending big hugs Sue x",

      "Content": "Hi So far so good on exemestane.  Although only sleeping 3 -4 hours a night but not sure if that's the exemestane or not.  I do still feel permanently tired and my memory is not what is was (I think lol) When I was on Letrazole all was good to start with then started to get really bad joint pains particularly in my hands and my onc changed it as it came down to the saying I hate 'quality of life'.  I know it explains the situation succinctly but I hate it.  Still getting hand pains but not so bad. Tamoxifen was not mentioned to me.  As I was still having periods I have the zoladex to stop them and apart from having some corking bruises to start with I'm now used to it.  Might be worth asking whoever gives you your injection to do it as low in your abdomen as they can as for me I bruise a lot less further down.  (Sorry if that's a bit graphic) I'm also in the 'I Want To Know' camp but as you said it seems to be a drip feed approach.  What I would recommend is steer well clear of Dr Google as you will just go round and round. Hope this helps Speak soon",
