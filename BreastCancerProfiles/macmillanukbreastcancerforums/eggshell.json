      "Content": "Lol that's so funny Emma. I'm reasonably new to this game. I had my new 'foob' fitted last week and l absolutely love it! It's the Amoena Natura and can honestly say it's a gazillion times better than my softie (although that did serve me well in the early days). My boobs both hang properly in my bra now which makes me feel alot more confident.  My breast nurse asked me to keep the box just incase it were to split within the next 2 years. That way they'd be able to return it for a new one. I asked her about having a spare incase there was a problem and she said to come back to her for another if I feel the need after I've finished my chemo. Cathy x",

I've been following your excellent blog since 'all this' started and I've just invested in the Jelly Pong Pong Wide Awake make-up after your recommendation.  It looks fab! Just need to learn how to apply it now and as I have a full set of eyebrows, i'll just have to jolly well wait!  Cathy x",

Did I actually go through all that? My survivor friends (and I have quite a few) often tell me that and I can't wait to be the one spreading my wise words of wisdom in the near future! I had my first TAC yesterday and feeling a little wiped but steroids are keeping me in check. I've fasted since Weds and had no sickness and been pottering about a bit today and generally feel myself - early days I know but am definitely digging this fasting lark. As long as you're not diabetic or underweight, it might be worth thinking about that for the next one. As part of my control freakism, I always like to have a few tricks up my sleeve lol.

      "Content": "Hi Mandie Glad you're feeling a bit better today. I too have to have the injections - 7 days worth after each cycle. I managed to administer it myself today with the district nurse watching over -  felt quite pleased with myself. My only problem now is big bone ache and i'm lying here with pillows and a hot water bottle trying to ease the ache. So far everything reminds me of pregnancy including that strange toothbrush/toothpaste thing that only ever made me gag when I was expecting - weird!  As regards to shaving, I was going to attempt it today but kind of chickened out at the last minute. I just want to get it over with but it feels like such a huge thing. The kiddies want to get involved so I'm going to let my daughter do me a funky fringe with shaved sides and the boys want to attempt some tram lines (god forbid). And besides, it gives them something to talk about in Show n' Tell at school lol.  Have fun with the wig fitting tomorrow! Gotta say, I love mine!  Cathy x",

      "Content": "Good morning Just interested to hear if anybody has had any experience with fasting before and after chemo? I've been reading lots about it on the American site and there seem to be alot of positive outcome from it - they've even started trials on this.  The general idea is to fast 60 hours before and 24 hours after and of course drink plenty of fluids. This then is supposed to  make the chemo work better and lessen the side effects considerably. What do think? Am I clutching at straws? I'll try anything!!!!  Cathy x",

But yes, sensible fasting sounds totally do-able and anything for an easier time of it and besides, I have a fair amount of meat on me so I don't think I'll be wasting away too quickly.  Thanks again, you've been very helpful.

As i was only 38, no bc in my family and breast fed my 3 children for a year each,  they had ruled cancer out - infact, fibrocystic breasts was their exact diagnosis. I pushed for a biopsy whilst having an ultra-sound and by doing so, I saved my own life that day. The medical team have been fantastic on my journey so far - i'm not knocking them , it just shows that being in tune with your own body can really pay off in these situations.  All the best, I'm sure everything will be fine.

Gotta say, the tax leaves me pretty achey for about 7/8 days and very tired but no sickness (just tax trots.....ummm nice). As I'm having 6 sessions of tax, I've been informed that each one gets that bit harder so I'm mentally prepared for that. The big positive is I had my 39th birthday yesterday so managed to bag a lovely meal with my family and friends and could actually taste it!  If I get the thumbs up for Thurs, I'll get a lovely Christmas dinner in too! Yes, for me one of the best parts is when those long awaited taste buds re-appear.     Fingers crossed for tomorrows bloods - I'm sure you'll be fine.     Cathy xxx  ",

I've got to say, they are fantastically comfortable and have a little pocket on the inside for your softie etc. They came in a pack of 3 for (roughly) £24.99 and are also available in pink to support BC. Definitely worth a look.    All the best Cathy x",
