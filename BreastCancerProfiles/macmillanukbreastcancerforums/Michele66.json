      "Content": "I don't post on here very often I should do more really!   I  had a mastectomy and a reconstruction using my back muscle 2 weeks ago. Has anyone on here had one? I'm still in pain, I have a big dent in my back where my muscle used to be. I wasn't expecting that, in less I was told and it didn't register! a lot of things didn't register at my appointments trying to take everything in is a nightmare! I am trying to be as active as possible, going for little walks but after walking for 10 mins, my back goes really tight and my bust feels like its swelling up and going to explode, does anyone else get this? I don't really know if what I am feeling is normal after this procedure. I'm just feeling sorry for myself today :-(",

      "Content": "Thank you, feel little better now, knowing what I am feeling is normal. I'll need an uplift too when I have my nipple done. there is hardly any difference in the size. Its the dent in my back that is concerning me, will that fill out do you know? it wasn't noticeable after surgery because of the swelling.   Thank you again. Big hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi Smudge   Not good news for me I'm afraid :-( they have found invasive cancer, they are saying it is grade 3 which is fast growing! With my age and family history my breast surgeon is recommending chemo, I have an appointment with an Oncologist on Wednesday morning to discuss this further. I've been feeling shell shocked all weekend, wasn't the news we were expecting!   How are you feeling now? I am feeling more human each day, my new boob and back are still feeling tight but not as bad as they have been, and I've been getting out and about more.   Take care xxxx  ",

      "Content": "Hi Pretty in Pink, I'm not slim at all, my surgeon and breast nurse are both on Hols this week, I see them next week, in the meantime I do have clinic tomorrow just to have dressings changed. I'll talk to someone then. I'm in Liverpool and under the Linda McCartney Centre.   Smudge: Thank you, I get my pathology results next Friday! I'm the same as you DCIS, the results of the tissue will determine what is the next step. Good luck for tomorrow I will have everything crossed for you.   Thank you again both of you. Take care lots of hugs xxx",
