      "Content": "My sense of smell went crazy whilst on EC, everything was super strong and I couldn't bear the smell of fabric conditioner, polish disinfectant etc.  It's ok now I have moved on to paclitaxel. But I drove everyone crazy going on about how strong everything smelled. I could have got a job as a drug dog.",

      "Content": "Hi papasmurf.  I am in exactly the same position you are in and was told at my checkup after surgery that chemo was a possibility and that the Oncotype test that is done in America will come back as either a no, a maybe, or a yes for chemo.  This helps to ensure that you get the treatment that is the best for you.  My surgeon feels that mine will be a maybe.  I'm not keen on the idea but am assuming it wouldn't be offered if it wasn't my best option to keep cancer free.  I have an appointment for next week to find out what's next.  Hope all goes well for you. Jessica ",
