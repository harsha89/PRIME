      "Content": "Hi Leonaw 123 I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 18th December just gone. I had to wait 11 days for biopsy results which does seem like a lifetime and it's 11 days of self torture of not knowing how bad the cancer is. Because let's face it we all think the worst. No matter how many people say to you not to worry they are not the specialists are they... !  I went on the 29th December for biopsy results and was pleased to be informed it was found early from a routine mammogram. Was 13mm grade 1. That was the result I wanted. Biopsy showed nothing in the lymph nodes but they have taken cancer and surrounding tissue and some lymph nodes nearest to cancer to be certain. I am 17 days post op and have appointment this Friday for more results. It's natural instinct to worry about results but seriously try not to. I made myself quite poorly through worrying but sometimes there are good results waiting. I wish you all the best for the future  Gina xx",
