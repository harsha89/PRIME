    "Content": "Im so worried. Last week while chasing up an urgent referal for an abdominal ultrasound the gp found a lump in my left breast and said the areola is misshapen so referred me for an urgent appointment. I'm so scared as for these last few months I've been so worried about whats going on in my abdomen that I haven't paid any attention to my breasts even though i have had a lot of pain in one which goes right into my armpit. I got an appointment through for next Monday but I'm scared what will happen, what will they do, will i get the results straight away, How long does it take?  I only got a text yesterday, no letter or anything and the text just reads \"reminder for breast surgery appointment on 24.10.2017\"  Does that mean I am having surgery? Sorry if my questions seem silly  but my head is all over the place. Many thanks for reading ",
