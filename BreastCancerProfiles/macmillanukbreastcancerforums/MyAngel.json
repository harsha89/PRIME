    "Content": "So great to hear about everyone's experiences, as moresleep said, its awful we find ourselves in this position, but the results of the diep operation is worth it. I am on the waiting list at present, I have had the ct scan to determine if my blood vessels are viable for this operation, happy to say they are. My situation is that I had a mastectomy and reconstruction at the same time following a series of operations to remove the cancer. The consultant used the new matrix type which I was told would protect from radiotherapy, it is now badly impacted, now its not sure if its due to the rads, scarring or my body rejecting the prosthesis, it causes severe pain and mobility issues, and like a previous member said I get breathless, Probably due to the pressure on my lung. So will be happy when I am called forward for the operation. Even if the recovery is slow.",
