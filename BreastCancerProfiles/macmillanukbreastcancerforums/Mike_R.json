      "Content": "Hi folks As some of you may have seen I developed a problem with my jaw. I've had a lot of pain with it over the last six months. At first we thought it was due to the Tamoxifen, but it turned out that wasn't the cause after coming off it for 8 weeks.Â  The cause was stress during the chemo phase of my treatment. I ground and clenched my teeth so much that it put my jaw muscles under so much tension that now, after visiting a jaw specialist, have been told I have cramp.Â  Good news is that it doesn't need any surgery. The best thing to ease it is to apply heat 4 times a day. Bad news is that I've now got to ease myself off tramadol, gabapentin and lorazapam. I've been on these to help with the pain and I've been told, and had some experience myself that coming off them is very difficult. We're seeing my GP tonight with a plan to gradually come off them. All this is due to being stressed. If there's anything you can do, or are offered that relieves stress, please grab it with both hands. It'll really help you in the long run. Good luck with the battle and take good care of yourselves. Mike xxx",

I've still a long way to go to get to anywhere near where I was, but that really doesn't matter. It doesn't look like it, but I am enjoying myself :) Good luck to you all going through your various stages of treatment. Mike xx",

I get the result from the head scan next week. I think all my post treatment symptoms are down to stress. Once all my results are in and hopefully (I have no reason to believe otherwise) they are clear I might start to relax. We (my wife and I) are looking at some relaxation techniques, maybe acupuncture etc but definitely a two week sunny holiday somewhere. I was diagnosed with StageOne Breast Cancer February last year and finished my chemo last July. It's just getting my brain to believe the good news and stop worrying! :) Thanks for replies",

      "Content": "I've mentioned this is another thread but happy to repeat myself in here :) I had the all clear in February this year. I had breast cancer, found lump under my nipple (left side). I had a mastectomy then 6 courses of FEC. Finished all my treatment in July last year. It hasn't all been plain sailing since. Lots of mental problems, feeling like it'll come back etc. I'm still having a very nauseous feeling in my tummy all the time but I'm putting that down to the cocktail of drugs I'm still on. I've had jaw pain from grinding my teeth when I was undergoing chemo, but that's slowly beginning to get better. But to be honest, that's nothing in the grand scheme of things. Cancer free sounds good. Best of luck and take care of yourselves. Mike Â xxÂ ",

If not, then I'll probably need a mouth guard or similar to stop me clenching my teeth. It's obviously stress related so there's lots of paths to go down to get me relaxed. I'm pretty much open to anything that helps. Mike",
