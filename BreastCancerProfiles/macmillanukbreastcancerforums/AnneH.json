      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear this. I used the cold cap and kept my hair - it became thin but it stayed, the cap prolongs your time in the chemo unit as it goes on about an hour before the start of treatment and stays on for about an hour afterwards. I took paracetamol beforehand as I knew it would give me a headache! Your hair needs to be very wet (smothered with conditioner) before it goes on and it needs to be very tight and touch your head all round to be effective. It's horrible but I took mindless candy crush (2 iPads!) to occupy my mind and some music - but the cap makes it hard to have earphones in! It was horrible but it worked really well for me - worth a try if keeping her hair is important to her. Good luck! xA",

I had it cut a bit shorter than usual, then before the cap goes on you need to wet your hair and plaster conditioner over it. The cap has to be a really snug fit, touching your head all over. You'll die when you see the machine as it looks like a Victorian medical instrument of torture! It starts about an hour before you have the chemo administered and stays on for about 45 minutes afterwards. Take things to pass the time and take your mind off it. I had 2 iPads to play mindless candy crush (2 so that when I was timed out I could use the other!) some people read but to be honest my head hurt and I couldn't concentrate. But it was worth it. I had the motivation of my daughter's wedding mid chemo - didn't want to wear wig and hat on a warm day if I could avoid it. My hair is thicker than ever and has grown a better colour than I used to dye it! Give it a go - if you don't try it you'll never know. If you can put up with the first half hour, you'll do it - and what's half an hour!? Good luck - let us know how you get on X",

I'm in S Bucks, mastectomy and chemo at High Wycombe, infection so in Stoke Mandeville overnight, radiotherapy at Mount Vernon! I asked the onc to do the PREDICT tool which compares you with 100 women who had the same type, size, stage, lymph etc. After surgery, chemo, radiotherapy and hormone tablets they can say how many were still alive and kicking 5 years later. Well, I'm 3 years in, you're 4 years in - we're good and going to stay that way! Don't be paranoid - but don't ignore anything.  I fully intend to be around for a very long time - you too?!

Wasn't keen on plain water, but sharper tastes from cordials )lemon or lime) were better. Half a lemon squeezed into hot water sometimes with a little squeeze of honey. Just make yourself drink! Most days I would eat a bag of salt and vinegar crisps - crisps or little salty biscuits seemed to get through the horrid taste. Arrowroot biscuits and ginger nuts were OK to nibble on. Someone recommended making ginger tea - boil sliced root ginger for a couple of minutes, drain and keep to drink when you can. (I found that it gave me indigestion but she swore by it - we're all different and need to try things! I'm 2 years post treatment now (8cm lobular, 23/32 lymph nodes affected) feeling great and loving my new life! You'll get through it and you'll be fine.

Getting movement back early is a great help in the long run. You do need to persist. I used to just do 2 or 3 stretches in the most peculiar places and sometimes got an odd look - but after what we've been through, should we care? No!

I had a visit from someone I worked with - not even a friend really. She brought mea bag - wouldn't even come in. When I opened it there was: Lip salve Simple shower gel & shampoo Silk pillow case (!) Mints Minty Chewing gum A book Hand cream Black nail varnish Cotton beanie hat A notebook and pen Tic Tacs All sorts of useful lovelies. That became my chemo kit and every time I went and  was a reminder of her amazing kindness. Your post reminded me of her and I thought you might like to do something similar. Other ladies might think if other things you could add - doesn't need to be costly, lots could come from the pound shop - it's just the thought!  I feel quite emotional remembering it 3 years later!

I asked about annual check ups for 5 years and she told me they are not doing them now. Recurrences of breast cancer are ALMOST ALWAYS picked up by the patient and are HARDLY EVER identified at annual check ups. By ceasing routine annual check ups, this frees up lots of appointments so that they can be very responsive when there is a need. Is this just BUCKINGHAMSHIRE saving money? Has anyone else had the same experience? I'm not confident that I would recognise a recurrence (\"Oh, you would!\") and am not sure how I feel about this! I thought that with breast cancer, there were national protocols and thought we all got annual checks for five years? Any news or views? xA  ",

I went on a bit, asking what it would cost for private MRI etc, and eventually  he agreed to request one; I go on Wednesday. Do get back to the consultant about this - its the best chance we have of picking up recurrence of a lobular cancer... good luck! (PS CT & bone scans showed no recurrence, so fingers crossed!)",

      "Content": "Hello! I asked for the 'cold cap' and WAs alarmed when I saw it! You have s A really really cold cap like a swimming hat with channels of ice in it, which fits very tightly and has to touch all your scalp and a strap under your chin, then you have it connected to a contraption like an old fashioned hair drier which keeps cold air pumping round. It goes on about 45 mins before chemo starts. And is switched off to 'warm up!' Once chemo ends, but you have to wait a further hour or more before its removed. Before you start, you thoroughly wet your hair and cover it with conditioner. My husband took a pic - it looks like a Victorian instrument of torture. I looked so extremely awful that I deleted the pic! Won't lie, I cried the first time but was determined to persist. I played candy crush mindlessly to take my mind off it. One of the nurses on the chemo ward would look at my sympathetically and say \"oh dear - do you want to stop it!\" When what I needed was a \"You're doing great - stick with it!\" My daughter was getting married half way through chemo and I wanted my hair - couldn't bear the thought of wig plus hat on a warm day!! I did keep most of my hair, a very even covering although it thinned.  I'm pleased I did it and photos looked OK! I may have pasted a pic!  If it's important to you, give it a go! xA",

It's hard to be pathetic and cry when someone is massaging your feet!  I took iPad to do mindless candy crush which occupied me and helped the time pass. I also took a lap quilt which kept me warm in the car in the way home. If you have Taxatere next, the cold time is less. You've done the worst part already! I needed a countdown, so before I started I put 6 bottles of champagne on the kitchen window ledge - after each chemo, the first thing I did was take a bottle down and put it in the fridge ready to party when it's all over! The visual reminder that the number kept decreasing was encouraging - treat yourself! I had a wig 'just in case' - but didn't need it and was able to return it brand new to the wig lady - that might be you too! Good luck - don't give up trying if it's important to you, Let us know how it goes! xA",

      "Content": "That's great news that your lymph nodes were clear (mine weren't :(. ) the oncologist described the chemo / radiotherapy as a 'mop up' operation, a sort of insurance policy in case ant rogue cells are remaining. It then makes a recurrence less likely. I too had huge problems with fluid - at one stage 600ml a week being drained! This week it was only 60ml so it's definitely calming down and dissipating. I read that deep breathing exercises helps. I did them and perhaps it helped - who knows! They haloed me fall asleep anyway! Very pleased your husbands cancer is gone. Good luck x",

      "Content": "Hello! I also had L side mastectomy. I was amazed at how quickly and easily it healed (I too have large boobs) and v little pain - just patacetamol or ibruprofen. I had the op in the afternoon and came home the next lunchtime - but wasn't chased out! I also had lymph node clearance, so I had a drain, but that wasn't a problem. I wobbled round without a bra for the first week or so, then my daughter bought me a couple of M&S mastectomy bras, which I used with a softie that I was given at the hospital to pad the empty cup. Lots of people praise tha Asda comfort bras. Don't buy stuff yet - use your old T shirt to sleep in, and it might not gape as much as you think! Someone I work with gave me a little heart shaped cushion that I could tuck under my arm to sleep - you can find them on the internet. It just helped and protected the scar. I was advised not to put anything on the scar for a while. Take advice - I used bio oil (or superdrug equivalent) once it was completely healed. Good luck - you will be FINE!

Maybe make sure they have your email address to keep in touch and you can email them if you can't get in to see them. xA",

I've elected to have it under general anaesthetic as it sounds potentially uncomfortable.my brother is an anaesthetist and said it's a procedure I might not want to be awake for! I'm well post menopause and 3 years post mastectomy, chemo & radiotherapy. I take anastrozole - could be a side effect. It was only a little spotting about a month ago and nothing since. I've had jelly on the belly scan and internal scan which shows thickening more than usual and what looks to be a fibroid. SO on Monday it's the hysteroscopy and biopsy of the fibroid.  I'll let you know how it goes! xA",
