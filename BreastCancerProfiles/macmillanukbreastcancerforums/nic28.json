      "Content": "Hi my 28 and new to here but I wanted some advice. I don't know where to start but ill start with a couple of questions and go from the replies. Is it possible to ave BC at my age, people think not but then I hear it can Happen?  Can you get inverted nipples (my hubby trys to pull them out and put normal) its not all the time and i get crinkled up aeora randomly like your going to BF? Have a lump maybe more than one, in most of the right side up towards my armpit and down to my nipple in my right breast.some are rock hard and don't move, are  pea size, odd shape others bigger but move able? More have seemed to appear. Hard to explain seems a large mass.over the area. Area seems thick and lumpy too not like the other breast. Has been achy, heavy breast quite painful and uncomfortable, better braless for some time. Only checked cuz of this morning show which is when i felt the lump. Cuz of the pain I thought I best check. The.first I've listed I never paid any attention too until recently as I thought I was just going old.   Then today redness appeared  around on the skin where the area.seems dodgy? And in the same area where I have stretch mark they have got  worse esp in on place for no reason? Seems quite purple red there with new thread veins too.  I get an odd numbness, hot and tingly sensation at times in that one area and can be hot to touch sometimes. Its freaky. Its feels heavy. And in the way lol. The gp said its enlarged noticeable too. Referred to breast surgeon clinic. Appt on mon. I didn't even want to get it checked my hubby made me ask the nurse at my smear test but told me gp at to do it. So she did, she wasn't my gp and was awful so I complained about her and she apologised then referred me lol  I'm not worried just curious and need open honest advice so please share your experiences and thoughts please . I'm sure other questions will pop up too thanks nic x Thanks x",

It was more recent the pain started and I found the lump now lumps. Not sure if im having just an us or what yet she said depends what the consultant says. X",
