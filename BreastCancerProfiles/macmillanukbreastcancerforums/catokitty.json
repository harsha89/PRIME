    "Content": "The same thing happened to me at my recall appointment after routine mammogram.  The doctor who did the ultrasound took ages with it and then asked me if I wanted to  know her thoughts or wait for the results appointment the following week.  I said tell me now please so she said that the appearance of the mammogram and the ultrasound was so suspicious that it was almost certainly cancer, couldn't really be anything else.  She showed me the images on the computer and explained what she meant.   They have a system for classifying the appearances and mine was at the top end of suspicious.   She then did the biopsies   The doctor said to me that breast cancer is very common and very treatable and to hang on to that, and I did find that a comfort.  It was all a horrible shock and I was in a daze for days afterwards but once I saw the surgeon and got a date for surgery I started to feel better.  Good luck with everything and do keep posting how you are getting on.  ",
