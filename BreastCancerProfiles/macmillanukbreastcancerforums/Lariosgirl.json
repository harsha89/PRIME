      "Content": "Oh my gosh, a hot water bottle!! That's exactly how mine felt when I first came round!! My diep failed as mentioned on 1st September, she just couldn't get the new supply to flow, despite 12 hours and 6 attempts, so put a temp implant with just a little saline in to start with. I'm sorry yours failed too, it's not something I'd even considered, they have such high success rates usually. Still, my cancer's gone and I've got a nice flat tummy for the first time since I was about 8 so every cloud!! I'm waiting to see the oncologist on 22 Nov, to hear my oncotype DX results and be told what happens next re chemo/radio then when I'm finished with all that treatment, it's back to plastics to decide on the next reconstruction attempt. Tbh,v when I first woke up from the failed diep, I felt sure I'd never have any unnecessary surgery ever again (lots of vomiting and found it hard to breathe for a few days) but the faff of going in and having my saline injected, together with the odd feeling I've now got a football on my chest and I'm already coming round to the idea of something more natural. I don't really see anything happening for quite some time so it looks like me and Dolly are together for a while longer!  X",

      "Content": "Hi Jilly, snap! My diep went wrong on 1st September and I too have a tissue expander in. I don't think mines leaked at all but it does have a tendency to creep about a bit, especially if I roll over at night or push it sideways, v weird!  Anyway, mines full and pretty much solid, so if yours feels soft I'm sure that must mean it's leaking, which saline or not, I'd want to get looked at?  When's your next reconstruction booked for? I'm fed up with this alien feeling, have to say!  Jane X",
