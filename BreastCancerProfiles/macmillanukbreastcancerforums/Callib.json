      "Content": "hi does anyone have experience of using tamoxifen or other hormone drugs to reduce size of tumour  before surgery . Was  due for surgery next week ( large excision lumpectomy) as I have two tumours neither large but together requiring a reasonable amount of removal  ( especially as I am quite small .)  I have been asked if I want to consider using tamoxifen to reduce size .. wanted to know if anyone had done this and if so did they think it was worth it . In my head ( and practically) I was all set for surgery  next week so am a bit all over  the place . ",

      "Content": "Thanks both . I hate making decisions too and in this case it\u2019s so hard to quantify the benefits of not having the op ( the only positive is it leaves the school holidays clear ! ) . Sometimes I think doctors need to think \u201cwhat would I advise my sister in this situation \u201c? I will try and talk to the nurse if I can\u2019t get hold of my doctor on Tuesday  . ",
