      "Content": "I had sentinel node removal, left breast masectomy and immediate reconstruction and right breast reduction on the 30th january. I was able to come out the following day and coped well. The district nurse called daily and took my drain out on the 4th day. I was pleasantly surprised with my recovery. However,  I am 61, retired and my husband is also retired. Everyone is an individual, with a range of different support and a different recovery, be gentle with yourself. Wishing you all the very best  on your journey. The support I have  had from the hospital and my cancer nurse has been great also this site and breast care charity, do not use Mr Google!!  The waiting is a really hard part. Sending you lots of love  and hugs. Xxx",

      "Content": "Helen, I had a masectomy, implant reconstruction and other breast reduction on January 30th. I was out of hospital the next day. My drain came out after 4 days without any pain. I have been very fortunate and made very good progress. I\u2019ve done my exercises, building up gradually, 3 times a day. I have been pleasantly surprised by my recovery. Scars healing so nicely that the consultant asked if he could take pictures!!! I never thought I would be a page 3 girl!! The worst part of the whole process I have found is waiting for results. All the very best to you for the operation. Sendings you lots of love and hugs xx",
