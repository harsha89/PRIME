      "Content": "I am slightly Asthmatic and have been waking up these past few nights with slight breathing problems.  Probably due to stress.  My GP had given me a 5 day course of Prednisolone for emergencies.  This is basically a Steroid.  I am having an MRI on Tuesday and seeing the surgeon on Thursday for results but I don't have access to a cancer support nurse yet and am worried about taking it in case I am feeding the animal or affecting my recovery. Sorry it is such a Medical question. this time. Teressa",

      "Content": "I had my mastectomy 18 months ago but still remember feeling terrified for a few minutes only as I lay on waiting to be 'put under'.  One thing to do that I wish I had done, touch your breast and say goodbye.  I know it sounds silly and it is probably just me.  The other thing is. do those arm exercises twice before you leave hospital - they are critical to your recovery - and ask for a  physio to pop in an see you before you leave to make sure you are doing them properly.   This helps your head 'hey look at me'.   You will be fine.",
