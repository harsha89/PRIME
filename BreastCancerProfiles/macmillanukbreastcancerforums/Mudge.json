      "Content": "Hi everyone, I had my first appt with my oncologist yesterday. What I have had so far is a lumpectomy and 4 lymph nodes removed on 30 Nov 13. Surgeon had said there were clear margins and no lymph node involvement so was expecting to arrange my tanning sessions and discuss hormone therapy. The oncologist dropped a bombshell by offering chemo as well. It's third generation regimen which he said is quite harsh using Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide for 4 cycles. My tumour (invasive ductal carcinoma)  was 21mm, grade 2 and although the lymph nodes were 'clear' there are some isolated tumour cells in one of them.  We went through the PREDICT tool and with no treatment 10 year survival is 89%, rising to 91% with hormone therapy and to 94% with hormone therapy and chemo. Although he has offered me the chemo, he said that most patients in the same situation don't opt to have it.  I am trying to get my head around this and have another appt on 5th Feb to discuss my decision. I know chemo isn't a walk in the park but I've read so many threads on here that it is doable. Has anyone else been in this situation? If so, did you choose to have chemo or not? I would especially like to hear from anyone on these particular chemo drugs. Many thanks, Mudge x",

      "Content": "Hi jeanfriend and Claire Thanks for your messages. Jean,  It's good to know you had the same chemo drugs and did OK with no regrets. Not sure why my onc has chosen TC as I don't have any other health problems. In fact, before cancer the worst I had was ingrowing toenails! Even though my onc has given me the choice, I feel I have no choice. If I don't take it and cancer returns in 5 or 10 years I would always feel I made the wrong decision. So, it might be belt and braces but I won't have that nagging doubt. Plus, like you, I want to give myself the best chance of survival.  My hubby is very supportive and already does much of the work around the house and I've got some good friends too to help me through so I think I will cope especially with everyone on this forum to help and advise me. Oh lovely, a new car. What have you got? Claire, thanks for letting me know that you are managing to work full time and care for your 3 year old whilst doing chemo. You are an inspiration! I hope I can sail through it too.  Many thanks everyone, Mudge x",

It's a bit of a shock isn't it when you think you only need the minimum treatment and then they suddenly throw something else at you. If you read through the thread you will see that I made the decision to have chemo some days ago and I am now all signed up! Before seeing the onc this week I spoke to my GP who is the same age as me and she said straight away that she would also go for it so I am happy with my decision. I am having a PICC line inserted next Wednesday and start chemo on Thursday. I can't say I am looking forward to it but it is a relief to finally be starting treatment. Many thanks, Mudge x",

Is this your last FEC or do still have more to come?  Is that why the nurse said it was late to have a PICC line? My veins are a nightmare too. I have always been advised to drink plenty of fluid before having bloods taken. I start chemo next week so am having a PICC line inserted next Weds. It is done under local and I have been told the whole process including xray and testing takes about an hour. My onc offered me a DVD to show how it is done but they didn't have any in the department. I found a video on You Tube of a PICC line being inserted which was quite useful and made me feel I have made the right decision to have it.  If you want to watch it you can find it here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3FRpXTyy8 I hope one of the suggestions posted helps and you have your treatment tomorrow.

That helps with the sore mouth but leaves a strange taste but you get used to it. I do get a few days when everything tastes like cardboard but it passes after a few days. By day 11 or 12 these symptoms have passed and I'm fine until the next treatment. I haven't suffered with constipation or achy joints though. Hopefully, you are over the worst now but make sure you drink plenty of fluids. I find water or fruit juice taste best when my taste buds go haywire. Mudge x",

I went to the GP yesterday and he prescribed a huge pump of Diprobase cream. I'm hoping it will help but the chemist told me to go back to the GP if it doesn't as there are other things to try.

      "Content": "Hi H, My consultant said that Lobular Carcinoma In Situ is a misnomer and isn't cancer although there is a very slim chance it may develop into cancer years later. Most never develop any further.  Here is a link to what is on the Macland site about it http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Breast/Aboutbreastcancer/Typesandrelatedconditions/Typesandrelatedconditions.aspx#DynamicJumpMenuManager_4_Anchor_2  and there's more info here http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/breast-cancer-information/breast-awareness/benign-breast-conditions/lobular-neoplasia-lcis  My patch of LCIS showed up as an area of calcified specks (white on the mammogram and black on ultrasound). I saw the xrays they took during the biopsy and even though the screen was magnified approx x 10 the specks were only about 2mm across, so very tiny. They were between 1.5 and 2 cm depth below the skin. I had  been told I will need an annual mammogram before this patch was found so I'm assuming I won't need one any more often than that now. The xray guided biopsy required 2 mammographers and a radiologist. It was like having a mammogram but they sat me in a chair and wheeled me up to the machine. Then they compressed my breast, just like with an ordinary mammogram. The upper plate is different, metal with a large hole in it. They then took a couple of xrays to make sure the tiny area they selected was central below the hole in the plate, then they took two more, one from each side to determine the depth. Once they had pinpointed it I was given a local anaesthetic to the area and the biopsy needle is loaded onto the machine and guided by the computer. It sounds worse than it is. I really didn't feel anything and the radiologist took 7 samples, all through the 1 entry point. They xrayed the samples so I was told straight away that they had what they wanted. They also took one final xray of the area after the samples were removed (probably for their spot the difference competition lol!!) I think it all took about 20-30 mins altogether. I went back 11 days later for the results but as cancer hadn't been found my consultant has ordered further testing on the samples and didn't have those results then. I got them a week later. As I had prepared myself in case it was DCIS which would have meant a mastectomy because the 2 sites were about 5 inches apart, I was relieved to find out this area didn't need treatment. I had my lumpectomy last Friday and was home on Saturday afternoon. I was really pleased that I had so much more movement in my arm than I expected. The district nurse has made her 2nd visit today and I have had my dressings off and I can drive again for short journeys which is great as it means I don't have to get hubby to drive me to the farm down the road to feed my horse. Keep in touch and let me know when you hear about your biopsy. Best Wishes, Fiona x",

The first was guided by ultrasound to confirm I had invasive cancer when they found a 2cm lump. A few weeks later, before my op, the radiologist found another area, a patch of tiny white specks so I had a 2nd biopsy. The specks were too small to locate using ultrasound so I had an xray guided biopsy. This is more fiddly and time consuming but completely painless. I was told it may or may not be cancer. Fortunately, the results showed this area was only LCIS which isn't actually cancer and doesn't need treatment, just monitoring.  You may be in a similar position and because it was late afternoon it was too late to arrange.  I hope you will hear something soon.  Fx",

I was feeling a bit of a voyeur just reading posts so thought I'd better introduce myself... It's good to know that someone has been through it all before and you are all marvellously supportive of each other.  I only knew something was wrong when I got called back for more tests following my first routine breast screening at the end of September (6 days after my 50th birthday).  A biopsy showed I had ductal invasive breast cancer under 2cm in my right breast. I was scheduled for a lumpectomy on 8th November but when I saw the Radiologist to have the guide wire inserted he found a second patch on the same breast. Surgery was postponed and I had another biopsy instead. I waited 3 weeks for the results and fortunately the new area was LCIS so didn't need treatment, just monitoring.  I finally had my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on Friday and will get the results on the 18th Dec.  I feel so lucky that my cancer was picked up so quickly and that everything happens so fast. It is just the waiting in between that gets to me a bit. ",

      "Content": "Hi Lindy, Thanks for the advice and sorry for taking so long to reply. I've got 2 dogs that I walk twice a day and although my husband helps out, I enjoy taking them so very much hope to keep on doing it. I also have a horse who lives out and I visit him once a day. I am lucky that the owner of the farm where I keep him takes care of him in the morning and is always happy to do my shift for me. I spent almost £60 in Boots this morning getting my kit together. Got 3 lots of mail varnish, black, purple and sparkly plus nail oil and loads of other stuff. Thanks everyone for all the suggestions. Hubby and I are going to celebrate valentine's day tomorrow as I probably won't feel up to it on Friday.",

      "Content": "Mmm donuts. Good suggestion, Alison.  I'm off to the local Tea Rooms tomorrow lunchtime. They do fantastic afternoon teas and cakes and such. I had a scone with clotted cream on my last visit so will definitely be having a bit of whatever takes my fancy. I have definitely found out who my friends are since being diagnosed. Some that I thought were friends hardly bother to keep in touch since I shared my news whilst others have remained true and are there for me when I need them. What has really surprised me most though are the people who are just acquaintances but have offered to come with me on my hospital visits, even treatment sessions. These offers have touched me so much I usually start blubbing.  Keep the naughty treat suggestions coming!",

      "Content": "Hi George and Jackie, Thanks for the links. This site is the only place I have found info on TC as a combined treatment. My onc gave me separate info on both drugs.  I'm glad I asked for the PICC because my veins are always difficult to find. Last night I experimented in the bath to see how easy it would be to avoid getting my arm wet and it was fairly easy. I've had my hair cut shorter but nothing drastic yet. I'm going to have my pre-chemo blood done and pick up my prescription for dexamethasone and lansoprazole tomorrow so thought I would pop into Boots for things I might need. I have ordered an ear thermometer from Amazon as the old thing I have is totally unreliable. By the way I think the glossary you have done is great. It deserves a permanant page on the website as really useful. Thanks, Mudge x",

Thanks for mentioning the anti sickness tabs. I will make sure I ask for some and take them whether I feel sick or not. I hope all goes well with your treatment on wed. Thanks, Mudge x",

      "Content": "Hi Alison, You could say I'm gearing up for battle now and I want to be ready to face it full on! Than you for telling me about the black nail varnish. I remember seeing posts about it but didn't know the reason for using it. I don't think black is my color so will cover up with purple! I'll put it and nail oil on my shopping list for tomorrow.  I've read a suggestion somewhere about covering my PICC with cling film but I always have a battle with that stuff so might get some waterproof dressings too. Many thanks, Mudge x",

      "Content": "Hi Jean, Wow! Thanks for all the advice. I just love vanilla slices but only have them as a very rare treat but what the heck! They may become a regular whilst on chemo. Losing my sense of taste, and not fancying food is one of my concerns. I must start a list of things to ask my BC nurse as I don't want to forget anything and my mental list is getting too long now (more than 3 things and I'm bound to forget at least one!) I love reading and listening to the radio and also have a Nexus 7 tab that hubby bought me before I went in for my op. It has been great and I've now got plenty of apps and music on it to keep me amused. I even started playing Candy Crush Saga after seeing it mentioned on here a few weeks ago. Sometimes something mindless is just what I need (on level 75). I'm also lucky that I have a brilliant hubby. He is very supportive and already does the cooking and a lot around the house. He always comes with me to my appointments and asks as many questions as I do.  I'm off to have a read of your blog now. Many thanks, Mudge x",

      "Content": "Hi Jean, Thanks for asking how I am. It's good to hear you are doing so well now. I'm almost half way through my second cycle with 2 more to go. I've got used to the pattern now so know I'm going to be really tired for a few days and then have a few more when everything tastes like cardboard. Yeuch! I had neutropenia on my first cycle so had to spend 5 days in hospital until my neutrophil level was up again. My onc increased the dose of the filgrastim  injections so have been OK this time. Apart from that I haven't had any problems or nasty side effects.  My hair started falling out a few weeks ago but got hubby to shave it off after a few days of moulting more than the dogs lol. I've kept at my part time job but have also been getting plenty of R & R in this lovely sunshine. Keep positive, Mudge x",
