      "Content": "Hi, I would really value some advice please.  I had my op on 13th jan to remove the cancer in my right breast, they took away two thirds of my breast and at the same time reduced my left breast to match and also removed some lymph nodes from under my right arm.   I hate how it looks I have two small breasts with side boobs, no nipples.  It is so sore and uncomfortable with a burning sensation  and it all feels so tight. They feel like they are about to explode !  Any idea how long this will last ?   I have to go back for another op this weds to remove more lymph nodes. Thanks",
