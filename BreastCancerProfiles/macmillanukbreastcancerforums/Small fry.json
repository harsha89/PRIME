      "Content": "Hi folks, sorry for late reply. I applied for my pair of \"Knitted Knocker\" when I found them on Facebook, didn't think it would happen anytime soon, as they said they were very busy. Then on 3rd January this year they arrived in the post, I was going in for my third surgery on the 5th January,, a lady called Chriss D made them for me, they came in a lovely white organza bag with extra stuffing to adjust the size. They have practically no weight and I don't sweat when I wear them. I would recommend that everyone should apply to them, if it's a single knocker or a pair, it's such a lovely feeling inside when they arrive, as someone, a complete stranger took the time out of their life to make me them! Good luck folks, hope you are all as well as can be expecte, x",
