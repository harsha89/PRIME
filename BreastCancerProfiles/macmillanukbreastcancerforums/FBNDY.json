      "Content": "Hello Very new to the online community but just read through all axilla node clearance posts and they are really helpful! Following neoadjuvant chemo I'm having WLE and Axillary clearance on 9th Jan. Am v worried about lymphodema risk ( my cancer is on right side and am very right handed) and wonder if anyone on here has experience of this long term? Bottom line is will I be able to do aerobics/cycling in future?Â  Thankjs all and Happy Christmas. xx",

      "Content": "hi DFishcake Thanks for sharing your experience - our circumstances do sound similar. Yes I\u2019ve had an MRI after third chemo plus 3 D mammogram and ultrasound after fourth and final session. I asked whether full ANC was necessary and my case was discussed at MDT. Apparently v good response in affected lymph nodes (1-2) and good response in tumour. Don\u2019t know if full pathological response yet. However, as I have only had 4x chemo rather than 6 sessions MDT don\u2019t have enough evidence to support advising of lesser surgery. (I only had 4 x EC as Type 1 diabetic). I do have meeting with surgeon on 5th Jan so will discuss all this...... do have feeling that full ANC could be over treating but also v conscious that my brand of cancer is aggressive and needs to be stopped. A crystal ball would be handy........ Fx",

      "Content": "Hi Gay Thanks for this - really encouraging to hear that you were back at the gym 6/7 ish months following ANC. I really don't/ didn't know what to expect and so it's brilliant to hear that you have been able to get back to normal with activities. Yep, hard to cram it all in when working full time.... good luck with getting back into gym post festivities. Fiona x",
