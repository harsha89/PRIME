    "Content": "Hi there, good luck with everything. I decided against the cold cap as was worried I'd be raging if I did it and it failed! , I had long hair, but I have to say I am fully happy wearing my wig, it looks better than my actual hair did! I too was really worried about the hair loss but i am 100 per cent fine with it.Â  I have to say I am more worried about the eye brows though, Best wishes x",
