(I can't stand them personally, but a friend of mine found them very useful.) I got myself out of the habit of planning my funeral and generally wallowing by reading huge amounts (Terry Pratchett's Discworld books were perfect) and watching films (Marx Brothers movies, Blues Brothers, The Commitments, Steve Martin) that made me laugh and gave me some lighthearted moments with my husband (his first wife died of breast cancer 20 years ago). Hope things improve for you!",

When my surgeon told me that I not only had clear margins, but there was barely any cancer left, just scar tissue, my first reaction was \"so I won't need RT!\".

Thankfully, he took it in his stride, although he was initially worried about me having chemo, but when I pointed out that a lot has changed in 20 years, and that I wanted to throw everything at it, he listened and accepted my views (and chemo actually went very smoothly, and shrank the tumour so effectively that I didn't need a mastectomy!). Secondly - practical help. He took on every household task (including the cat litter trays!) and never complained when I suddenly decided I desperately needed raspberry trifle at 8.30pm! Nothing was too much trouble, even shaving my head (which must have brought back painful memories for him).

Thankfully, he took it in his stride, although he was initially worried about me having chemo, but when I pointed out that a lot has changed in 20 years, and that I wanted to throw everything at it, he listened and accepted my views (and chemo actually went very smoothly, and shrank the tumour so effectively that I didn't need a mastectomy!).

I now am on Letrozole for 10 years, plus three years of ibandronic acid tablets and calcium/Vit D and B12, and am a happy bunny.
