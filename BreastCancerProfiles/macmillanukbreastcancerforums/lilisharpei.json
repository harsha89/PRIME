    "Content": "Just a warning to anyone who has been transferred from tamoxifen onto arimidex. Make sure that you are post menopausal otherwise the oestrogen produced by your ovaries will not be blocked. Arimidex only stops the production of a small amount of oestrogen. It happened to me. I was still menstruationg before tamoxifen (im 54 now). I was on it for 2 years and then the consultants decided to put me on arimidex for better protection. BUT after 6 moths I had the period to end all periods. I was worried at first but then realised that I hadnt gone through the menopause ! So oestrogen was starting to flood my body again !! It was a big worry and I went to the breast care dept to see the consultant. He and the oncologist decided to give me zoladex injections every month in conjunction with arimidex so that all the bases are covered. Zoladex is a slow release pellet that shuts down the ovaries by blocking an enzyme produced by the pituitary gland. SO BE VIGILENT AND ABOVE ALL INFORMED !!",
