      "Content": "Hello everyone, newbie here. Is anyone using this cream for vaginal atrophy ? If so, how long have you been using it, does it work, any problems or concerns? My gynaecologist has prescribed it but I am nervous about using it. I have been told it is a very low dose, hardly negligible but I am worried about my breast cancer returning if I start to use it. thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief, yes my cancer was oestrogen positive. Not sure what alternatives there are. My oncologist didn\u2019t tell me about letrozole and atrophy, or about creams etc. All these things I have had to research myself with the help of my husband. Dilators were useless, didn\u2019t help at all.  R",

      "Content": "Hi Bibi, I have been using estriol 0.01 cream daily for almost three weeks, then I will go on to 1 pessary twice a week. I have noticed a difference already in inserting  the applicator it is not so painful. The cream as someone said is messy but easy to use,I also noticed what goes up didn\u2019t come down for a couple of days and then ..WHOOSH! Hope this is not too much information, every other day I would have a gush. I am going to try and use a dilator when I am on the tabs twice a week and report back if that will help someone.",

How long did it take to get back to normal, my gynaecologist reckons it will be every day for about 3 weeks, then 2-3 days a week for another few weeks, then see how it goes. I don\u2019t want to be taking it for too long. I really want to give it a try, but am a little nervous. thanks",

      "Content": "Silly me, ignore last message, I need to get used to the site. Went to see my oncologist yesterday about the estriol cream, he said that should have been taken care of a long time ago and feels the \u201dteam\u201d has failed me. I had been told zero oestrogen to be given to me, I thought it was for life, nothing was explained properly. If it wasn\u2019t for my husband I would not have found out about estriol. I guess I am old school in that whatever the Dr says goes.  However, Mr oncologist  was very reassuring which helped me to relax and he prescribed Vagifem. I will start to use it today and keep a diary. My libido had totally gone, I feel it has been slowly returning in the past few weeks, wanting to get together with hubby and getting nowhere. I am Hoping the fear of painful intercourse will go after I have been using Vagifem and love making return to normal. Fingers crossed. ",
