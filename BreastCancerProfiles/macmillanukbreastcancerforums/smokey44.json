    "Content": "Hi All, To date,I have had two Zoladex injections & am about to have my third tomorrow.I have three more radiotherapy sessions to go & then need to start the Tamoxifen. My periods have stopped,& the hot flushes have started,but the worst thing is last Thurs I started crying for absoluetly no reason - very embarrassing when there are other people around!I felt abit better over the W/E but today (Tues),it has happened again waiting for my radiotherapy treatment. Hence, Mandy I sympathise & do understand.Am hoping that you are feeling better since you wrote this back in June. So far,I have amazed myself & family/friends with how positive I have been since getting my diagnosis.So,it's abit of a shock feeling so vunerable  suddenly out of the blue.I also have itchy spots on my arms which my Doctor thinks are insect bites,but am wondering if these too could be the Zoladex?
