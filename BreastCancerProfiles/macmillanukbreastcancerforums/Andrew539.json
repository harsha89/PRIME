    "Content": "Hi, I've been caring for my wife now for six years. In this time she has had three recurrences of non-hormonal breast cancer. Six years battling with her but on my own. Some help from family and friends but I've been withher for every onoclogy visist, every scan and every treatment (barring radiotheapy). She's very weak now and can't get about very much. I'm also working a fifty-hour week (like most I guess) but it's now getting very difficult to cope. Oddly I can cope with work - perhaps because I'm in control. But seeing my wife in pain is very hard to take - more so becuase there is very little I can do.",
