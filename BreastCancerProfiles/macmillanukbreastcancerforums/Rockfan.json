      "Content": "Hi hope your op went OK and you are well.  I think it depends on how well and/or fatigued you were before your op that makes a difference.   I didn't have chemo before my lumpectomy/ lymph node removal but i'd been fatigued for ages i thought it was just being a busy working mum and was planning to reduce my hours.  If you've had chemo it may take you a little longer to recover after the op so give yourself time.  The anaesthetic/morphine makes you think you can climb mountains so it's easy to do too much initially..  I was up and about the next day walking the dog for a couple of hours!  I had my op in  August and to be honest I think I  am still recovering I still have tired days and have to pace myself. I can't sit for long but I make sure i chill for about 20mins every couple of hours and have a cuppa but sometimes I need a longer rest.   I started driving in the fourth week but it can be a little uncomfortable if the op was on the left side probs best to follow your units advise. Take care of yourself and I suppose the best advise is listen to what your body is telling you and rest when you need to.  It gets easier to rest with practice my energy levels are more consistent rather than up and down if i have short rests during the day. I think even though the op is not so traumatic as a mastectomy there is still the whole emotional  rollercoaster of the diagnosis to cope with  and of course the follow on treatment.   I kept my wound dry for 14 days and didnt change the dressing for 7 days which is ok with modern dressings but again best to check with your units advise.  My wound healed really well but there is bruising which takes a few weeks to settle.  The post op exercises helped.  I started swimming again after a month  and wound check and review by consultant  but unfortunately have to stop when RT starts.  Good Luck x",

      "Content": "Hi Liz thanks for your advise I have tried to be open with my kids as suggested and also got some advise from macmillan.  It is such a difficult time and I  agree teenagers do like to have some control and input into their lives and like to know what's happening, although don't always want to talk about it.  I have just made it clear that they can talk to me any time and they can also look at the macmillan website. I have also told them that it is ok to still talk about anything in their own life that may be worrying them which is still important.  Right now I am supporting my son with a revision plan and as I am not working at the moment  have more time to help him.  This helps me cope as it takes me out of my own worries.  I hope your three are doing well in Uni and you are coping with them being away and perhaps have time to spoil yourself a little.  You are right in saying that families have to all pull together, the fractures in family can really show at times like these and people don't always respond how you expect.  My kids have been the most caring and supportive so I owe them to stay strong and positive. I hope your MIL and father are well at this time and your treatment is ok. Thankyou and best wishes Lindax",
