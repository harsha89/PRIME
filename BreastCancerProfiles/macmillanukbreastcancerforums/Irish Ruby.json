    "Content": "Hi Roundhouse, Just to reassure you, if possible, I had HER2+ breast cancer, and one node was affected, and I am still here alive and well almost 10 years later.  I think when you mum gets going on her treatment plan she will feel better mentally.  She will have bad days when she feels low and other days when she will be feeling ok.  I got antidepressants when I was diagnosed and counselling and both these helped a lot.  Your mum is suffering from shock and in the early days you always think the worst.   She is lucky to have such a caring daughter around.  When you get cancer you life does change and you lose your hair with chemo and to an extent your femininity.  Sweetheart, she will come round and all you need to do is be there for her.  Spend time with her and plan little treats for her,  When you are having treatment a lovely text message, a bunch of flowers or going for coffee, small things and gestures from the people you love are the most important. Take care and believe me she will get her head around it all in time. Regards Ruby ",
