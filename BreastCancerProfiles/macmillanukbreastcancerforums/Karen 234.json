Fed up now, just want it done with.  Lots of love to everyone going through this c**p xxx",

There is a light at the end of the tunnel.  I've conpleted 3 lots of EC and 10 out of 12 weekly Taxol. Onco rang me yesterday to say he doesn't want me to have the final 2 Taxol. My hands are still sore from a rash and he thinks my body has had enough. He's happy for me to stop early, saying will be minuscule difference and not to worry. Mixed feelings really, glad to finish chemo but also I failed to get to the end. Anyway, good news is I might be able to taste my Christmas dinner.  Lots of love xx",

Had no problems with it and it\u2019s saved the veins in my arm and avoided having lots of needles. They have been able to get my weekly bloods through it too. I don\u2019t know why it isn\u2019t offered to everyone. I think the Hickman line is more invasive, although I don\u2019t have any experience of that. Going tomorrow for my picc line removing which seems to be a minor procedure.  Lots of love xx",

There was no sickness afterwards, anaesthetics are so good nowadays. I had a bit of a problem the next day with a small haematoma but no further surgery was needed and it will just go away on its own. Not too much pain, I just needed paracetamol. I have been doing the recommended exercises and have full movement in my arm (I had 4 lymph nodes removed). It is really doable. I'm very squeamish and I wouldn't say it was okay if it wasn't. Please message me if you want to chat. Sounds like I'm just one stage ahead of you in our treatment. We can compare notes!  Karen xx",

The doctor told me the lump was totally removed with clear margins and nothing in lymph nodes. I kept worrying it was spreading while I waited for the operation but the doctor kept reassuring me it doesn't work like that and he was right! I'm waiting for the results now from the Oncotype test to see if I need chemo to stop any recurrence. It's all a waiting game but try and just take one step at a time and you'll get through it. It's rubbish we've had this diagnosis but it's a good result, if you know what I mean! Keep thinking it's caught early and it's treatable. Loads of help on this forum. Lots of love  Karen xx",
