    "Content": "wombat.23 Hi Julia, I had back pain when first diagnosed but it went when I had surgery. I keep thinking it is my mind playing tricks, but no it is still there. Keep resorting to a hot water bottle. I don't think I have seen any other posts about upper back pain. I am in hospital tomorrow to have a picc line fitted so I will mention it. I just feel like an old lady age 43.  Had an argument with other half today, couldn't believe it. Don't know how he feels etc,etc, he has had enough. I was like are you for real??? Surely at this time you could be more positive for me, but no. How do I cope with this at this time? Part of me is thinking well f off then, cos I really don't need this.  sigh, sorry. xxx Hi  The whole experience including the treatments/surgery can have a huge impact on our emotions and most of the times our husband/partner gets to see the low moods and emotions. Men have different ways of dealing with things sometimes even though you could do without the extra stress from him right now. I would really say maybe try and talk to a psychologist which can be arranged via your breast care nurse. You both can attend and it might help to just let things calm down and give him the chance to understand you abit better in this difficult time and be patient with the situation. Because you will fight this and you will get through it xx ",
