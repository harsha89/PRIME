    "Content": "Hi Chloecat45, Sorry to hear that you are going through such a hard decision. After reading your post I felt compelled to respond.  When I was diagnosed with Invasive breast cancer, 2.5 cm lump ,grade 3 also with DCIS as a bonus in August this year  I was demented with worry.  I am 46 years old and I considered alternative therapies but after reading everything through MacMillan and reading other forums I felt more informed and able to come to terms with future treatments, albeit dramatic and invasive in their own right.  I have had a mastectomy and am preparing now to start chemo shortly followed by hormone therapy for at least five years.  I have a husband and a child and a full-time job.  I feel that if I did not do everything I could to beat this beast they would never forgive me and for whatever time I would have left I would not forgive myself.  The risk of trying alternative therapies, in my mind, was not worth it.   I had an aunt who ignored all the symptoms of breast cancer and when finally seeking medical advice was found to be stage 4.  Sadly she passed away in her late forties leaving a husband and 4 sons behind. You may see people posting on forums about secondary cancers but what you don't see are all the numerous people who have had 'conventional' treatment who are out the other side and living with no evidence of the cancer.  Most do go on to live long, healthy and active lives. I know you want to talk to people who may reinforce alternative therapies / treatments but please consider conventional treatments because as others have stated they do work.  None of us wanted to be cut or to have our bodies bombarded with x-rays or filled with poison.  This disease will only spread if not kept at bay.  If you would like more information about the actual operation and implications of treatment and reconstructions please ask.  There are many people out there who are able to offer advice and support. Only you can make your decision but take into consideration that many people do not use forums and just move on with their lives after successful treatment.  It may be worth considering conventional treatments with extra therapies such as reflexology and meditation as complimentary treatments. Good luck to you whatever you decide. CK x",
