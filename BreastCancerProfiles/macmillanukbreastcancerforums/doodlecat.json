      "Content": "Binny my bone mets were diagnosed via CT scan.  Bone scan done at a later date.  As said could be checking for other damage.   Is is good they are taking you seriously and investigating. Not sure if this is any help but I have multiple widespread bone mets but have very little pain only in my sternum.  Letrozole caused me joint pain though.  Unrelated to mets. June xx",

      "Content": "Like Janet I am usually more fit than the people asking me how I am (and I have secondaries).   I answer depending on who is asking.  Where I stay we ask each other how we are as a type of greeting.  If someone asks me how I am keeping though usually just say really well and you wouldn't know there is anything wrong with me.  Apart from side effects of treatment that is but not everyone would want to hear thst answer. Someone did ask me a lot of questions today and it was clear he was interested. So I answered as truthfully as I thought he could cope with.  It was funny though as after I told him I had a lot of spread and could only get treatment not a cure he then asked how long treatment would last for.  Just told him for as long as it works.   June x",
