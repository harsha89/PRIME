      "Content": "Hi Rebecca, I had the same feeling when I was washing my hair when it was growing back in and bring my hair forward and when I looked up I could see the end of my hair  it's such a good feeling when things get back to \"normal\" no weekly visits to whatever specialist appointment you have, I still have some side effects but fatigue is the worst  i had long hair before diagnosis but have decided to keep shortish as I have hot flushes from Tamoxifen and don't want to tie my hair back, but in 9yrs time I'll be 54 and might start to grow it long  take care  x",
