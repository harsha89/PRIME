    "Content": "Hi Veronica, I had my PIP assessment Friday just gone & I have to say like you I was apprehensive. I shouldn\u2019t have been at all. I don\u2019t know if I was just lucky but I had a lovely guy that visited me at home & although he was thorough he was very gentle & caring in the way he went about asking the questions he needed to. When it came to asking more personal questions about my condition he went on to explain that he was medically trained & a former nurse, which was good to know as I knew then he\u2019d understand the majority of what I had to add. The assessment went without a hitch & he was probably at my home around 45 minutes or so. He also asked me to do a couple of mobility exercises as I also have arthritis & this is down on my application as well as my cancer diagnosis.Â  Just to add before I go he mentioned when the assessment was finished that it would probably take 6 to 8 weeks for a decision to be made & if I was declined to appeal as often appeals are successful in cases that are declined first time. Hope this is useful. Nic",
