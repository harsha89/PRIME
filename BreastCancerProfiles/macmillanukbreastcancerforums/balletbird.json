      "Content": "    I have been on letrozole since December 2013, having abruptly stopped HRT in the September when I was diagnosed with early Grade 1 breast cancer.  I therefore immediately plunged from feeling great on the HRT (I\u2019ll never know whether the HRT triggered the cancer, but hey ho, it is what it is), to having a second menopause followed shortly after by all the usual side effects of this horrible, but probably necessary drug.  I initially experienced 30 \u2013 40 hot flushes daily, increasing joint pain, significant tiredness and trouble sleeping.  The pharmacist gave me whatever he had in stock at the time, so over the last 16 months I have had Cipla, Activist, Zentiva and Teva (and possibly others where I didn\u2019t save the packaging).  The worst of these was Activist which turned me into a virtual cripple and the best Sandoz, but I only had it the once, and just one month\u2019s worth of it.  After the Activist I always asked the pharmacist what he had in stock before he filled out the prescription and usually he had Teva, which he said seemed to suit most women on letrozole.  It was tolerable but I still felt awful first thing in the morning and anytime getting up after sitting for some time.  I have also just had severe arthritis diagnosed in my hands, having also had a trigger thumb a few months ago.  A year ago I fortunately, had no sign of any arthritis in my body.  I also had lots of nights when I either couldn\u2019t get off to sleep for a couple of hours, or if I dropped off quickly would wake at 4.00 in the morning and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep for at least an hour and a half.  (I can really empathise with the 4.00am club!)   I used to be a professional ballet dancer and I still teach a class once a week.  As I was finding it increasingly difficult to dance at any acceptable level and having read several posts of how much better the original Femara was, I tried over several months to see if I could be prescribed Femara.  Initially the hospital said it was down to the GP and the GP said he couldn\u2019t prescribe it unless the hospital recommended, it as the local PCT would \u2018hang him out to dry without hospital approval)!  I finally managed to speak to the hospital consultant and on hearing how I was getting close to having to stop teaching, she actually agreed that she would write a letter of recommendation to my doctor with the suggestion that I be allowed to try a 6 week trial and if it proved to be beneficial, that I should be allowed to stay on it.  I have now been on Femara for just over a month and I have to say there is a huge improvement.  The joint pain has almost disappeared and although I\u2019m still a bit stiff when I first get out of bed, I can get up after sitting down for a couple of hours with barely any problem.  I\u2019m also sleeping better and the hot flushes are now down to just three or four a day.  I know we all react differently to these drugs, whether letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen or any others I don\u2019t know of, but for me it\u2019s been a huge change in just a matter of weeks.   The reason for writing this rather long post is that I had kept several leaflets of the generic letrozole, although unfortunately not for Teva or Zentiva.  I have now looked in detail at the ingredients of these to see the differences with the fillers.  (There have been many threads over the last few months that I have been on this forum, explaining that whilst the basic drug is the same, the coatings and fillers can be different).  Femara itself is manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited.  Sandoz is manufactured by Novartis and Salutas Pharma GmbH.  On reading the ingredients, they are identical for Sandoz and Femara! I am now wondering if Sandoz, could actually be, in fact Femara?  It occurs to me that now Femara is out of patent and costs £84 a month compared to the average £3 per month for the generic letrozole, they would rarely sell any of it.  Would they have taken the decision to carry on selling it as a generic, so at least they still get a share of the market, rather than virtually nothing?  I would be interested to hear what Dreamthief, Mistymoley and others who frequently post think of this notion.  There was also someone a few months ago who was very knowledgeable about pharmaceuticals and if he/she\u2019s still around, it would be interesting to know their thoughts.  If I\u2019m right it could make a huge difference to all of us on Letrozole who have had severe health issues with the generic brands and who\u2019s GPs refuse to change them to Femara.    When I looked at the ingredients for Activis, there were several differences and it might be interesting if others could note the differences between the inactive generic ingredients on the letrozole tablets they\u2019re currently using.  I\u2019m listing Femara/Sandoz below: 2.5mg letrozole (obviously common to all) Silica aerogel, cellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate, maize starch, sodium carboxymethyl starch, hydroxpropl methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide (E17) and iron oxide yellow (E172)   I\u2019m sorry this is such a long post and I hope you haven\u2019t all given up by now, but I thought it might be really important.  Obviously Novartis wouldn\u2019t ever confirm that Sandoz was the same as Femara (if it is), or they would never ever sell the higher costed Femara again.  The other manufacturers wouldn\u2019t be too pleased either!  However, as Sandoz is sold simply as a generic costing (I assume) about the same as all the others, surely GPs wouldn\u2019t object to putting Sandoz on the prescription?  As I\u2019ve finally managed to get Femara, I\u2019m hoping my GP will allow me to stay on it as he has indicated he will, but if I ever have to change doctors and the new one refuses to fund Femara I will definitely ask for Sandoz.  It might be interesting for all of you on anastrozole or tamoxifen to also compare ingredients and for anyone on the original anastrozole (is it Arimadex?) to give us the details of manufacturer and added ingredients to see if the same thing is happening with that drug.   Anyway, phew, that\u2019s all for now, but I will be really interested in your responses.  Cyber hugs to you all.  Jane x",

      "Content": "Hi Quasie.  Thanks for your kind words at the end of your post, I'm so glad it's been useful.  Obviously both the original letrozole, branded Femara and the now generic versions of the drug are essentially the same, but it's amazing how differently the generic versions can affect our bodies.  If you do have problems getting your GP to switch you to Femara I can't see why he would object to writing Sandoz on the prescription.  If he does, why not ring your normal pharmacy before you go in and ask if they have Sandoz?  My pharmacist said they never know what they will have in stock as they just order letrozole and are sent whatever is available at the time.  However, as Sandoz is one of the generics you could just ask any of your local pharmacies if they have any and go from there.  Obviously, I can't be sure if Sandoz is actually Femara, but with identical ingredients, unless the quantities of the fillers very greatly, it's as close as we're going to get.  Good luck.  Jane",

      "Content": "Hi everyone.  I'm pretty new to the group, previously posted a couple of times under the name of Jane, Eastbourne, but thought I'd change that to something a bit less identifiable.  All I want to say today is Happy Mother's Day to us all, as I imagine most of us are either mothers or hopefully still have mothers.  Sadly I'm not with either of my children today, but son No 2 has just sent me some lovely flowers and a card that he'd had done with four photos of me over the last 40 years which is brilliant.  Son No 1 sent me a text, but is with his partner's family and that's fine as his partner isn't well and they have a 7 month baby.  Anyway, now I feel really part of the group I will post again about a couple of things that might be helpful to a lot of people on this site, but in the meantime, have a great day, forget about your troubles for a few hours if you can and cyber hugs to you all.  Jane",
