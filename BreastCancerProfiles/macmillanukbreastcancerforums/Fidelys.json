    "Content": "Hi, it's my first I time posting too. Like you i've had such a hard nerve-wracking time over the past few weeks. I went to my GP at the end of November fully expecting her to say there was nothing wrong with me but instead got sent to the local Breast Clinic where I was diagnosed a week later with stage two invasive lobular cancer.  The GP had told me she thought the lump was 3-4 cm (how could I have missed that for so long especially as I'm only a 34a bra size so not much there to start with), then ultrasound and biopsy stated lump was 4-5 cm, then MRI week before Xmas showed lump was 6.5cm. Yikes, this was getting worse every time! MRI also showed no sign of tumour in other breast or lumps, but I'm dreading my mastectomy next week, not because I'm losing a breast, but because I'm scared they are going to come back and say it has spread after all. I can't stop worrying even though I know I should be trying to remain positive.  I've been told I am getting radiotherapy but at the moment it looks like no chemotherapy.  Does anyone know when would they do chemotherapy, is it only if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, as I read somwhere that if a tumour is large you should have chemo.",
