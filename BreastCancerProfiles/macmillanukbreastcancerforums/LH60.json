I\u2019m probably verging on going down that route as I am not sure I could deal with a third failed excision!  Just wondering why you say with hindsight you wish you had tried for a third time?  X",

I\u2019ve been so torn between both options! My emotions are all over the place and I really can\u2019t carry on like this! I\u2019m hoping a decision will help!  Xx",

I have an appointment with surgeon who does mastectomies with immediate reconstruction next week, so maybe I\u2019ll be clearer and more able to make an informed decision after that! I\u2019ve been struggling emotionally and so, even though I\u2019d really like to try one further re-excision, I\u2019m not sure I could take another failed op! I\u2019m also aware that my boob is already quite distorted after two ops and will probably look even more so after a third!  Are you pleased with results after reconstruction? How painful did you find it was compared to lumpectomy? ",

      "Content": "Oh my goodness- I\u2019ve just read your profile and you\u2019ve certainly been through a lot!  I\u2019m so torn between giving the wide local excision one more go and then having a mastectomy if that isn\u2019t successful or going straight for mastectomy now!  Spoke to BC Nurse earlier and she thinks I should meet with the consultant who does reconstruction and discuss pros and cons , then make my decision! Have hit appointment with her next Wednesday! A big part of me really wants to keep my breast but then I don\u2019t know how I would cope emotionally if margins weren\u2019t clear after a third op!?  Everyone keeps telling me I\u2019m strong- and I usually am but I just don\u2019t feel it currently! I\u2019m struggling being off work ( I\u2019m a primary school Headteacher) and yet I can\u2019t focus on things at all!  You are amazing the way you\u2019re coping with all that\u2019s happening to you! I need to try to be more positive! Easier said than done though!  Thank you so  much for replying to my post! It helps to get the perspective of someone who has first hand experience of BC!  Sending you hugs and good wishes for the future! ",

      "Content": "Hi I\u2019m new to this group and would welcome advice to help me make a choice! I had 30mm invasive cancer removed via lumpectomy ( lymph nodes all negative)and then had a re- excision as there was DCIS in margins! Yesterday I was informed that there\u2019s still DCIS in margins and given choice of a further re- excision or mastectomy with reconstruction! I\u2019m gutted as I was really thinking all would be fine after re- excision and I would be moving on to radiotherapy alongside hormone therapy treatment! Now I\u2019m a mess and keep fluctuating between both types of surgery! I just feel so emotional! Can anyone advise me? ",
