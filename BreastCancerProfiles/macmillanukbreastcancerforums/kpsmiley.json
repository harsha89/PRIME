      "Content": "Hi there Now had 2 rounds of chemo (EC) so far, third round is on Thursday. This time I developed really painful mouth ulcers on the side of my tongue right at the back (so really difficult to get to!) which also led to inflamed gums. Does anyone have any advice how to avoid the ulcers, or if they can't be avoided how best to deal with them? Thanks K x ",

I also went to Camden Market over the weekend and invested in a couple of hats to keep my head warm. Hope you are both doing and feeling well.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I've had my mastectomy and reconstruction and a reduction and lift on the other side to match them up and am now having chemo. I'm on 8 rounds of EC Paclitaxil. I tried the cold cap on my first EC (and succeeded) but decided the pain was not worth it so didn't use it yesterday (round 2). The upshot is my hair will start to fall out in 2 to 3 weeks time and I am keen to get in a pre-emptive strike and shave it off before it all falls out. Anyone got any idea how to do it? I am assuming you can get clippers to get it very short, but am interested in the shaving aspect. Would anyone recommend and electric razor or a wet razor? Thanks for your help KP",

      "Content": "Can anyone help me? I need to decide in the next 24hrs whether to have a portacath fitted or not... I have had 2 chemo treatments so far (out of a total of 8) and both times the nurses on the day unit at the Royal Marsden took 2 goes to get a cannula in. It looks like i have 'mobile' veins! I'm worried about 2 things: 1) the scar that will be left afterwards - how visible will it be in clothes? I've now got much smaller breasts than I had (one is an implant the other was lifted and reduced so it would match the implant) and was really looking forward to being able to wear strappy tops for the first time!!! 2) What can you feel if you have it down under local anaesthetic?  Does anyone have any guidance, thoughts, words of advice, personal experience they can share with me to help me make this decision? Thanks KP x ",
