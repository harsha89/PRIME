    "Content": "I feel that I had NO choice whatsoever. I never chose to have cancer, and to be honest the notion of \"choice\" NEVER came into any of my treatment so far. Well, except the choice of (possible) life of death. Sorry to be so blunt but when you are diagnosed with what is a life-threatening disease there is only one choice. And I think that most people, before making any sort of choice, probably have other people to consider - children, spouses, maybe even elderly parents, etc, who not only rely and/or depend on us but love us too. I felt that I could NOT choose the path of NO treatment, because I had other people in my life I felt that I somehow \"owed\" to them to do everything I could to get better (that's the hope). Going through the surgery and the chemotherapy (I am yet to start radiotherapy) is something that NO sane (healthy) person would EVER choose. It's \"devil or the deep blue sea\" and we somehow manage to fight the devil; i.e. we somehow manage to haul ourselves through the pain and trauma of the treatment, in the hope and belief and trust that it will make us better - or at the very least give us a longer time to be with those we love or who need us. And then of course is the very strong survival instinct which most living creatures possess... I do apologise, but the idea that we have some sort of choice is like me asking you \"When you stand on the edge of the railway station platform, as the 10:10  express to Southampton approaches,  what choices do you have? And why do you choose not to throw yourself under its wheels?\" The only choice I feel that I have REALLY had, so far, is whether it is better to travel via the A34 or the A6 to the hospital on Wednesdays for my chemotherapy.  And as the A6 is normally tail-to-nose with slow-moving traffic I choose the A34. Oh, and I choose to have coffee and not tea from the lovely Volunteer Lady who comes around the chemo ward every half hour, topping us up as we sit there, wired up to machines which drip and beep and freeze, having chosen not to jump off the platform. Good luck with your research, and good health.",
