    "Content": "Carol2 just wanted to say I understand the traumas of central lines - we met a friend at lunchtime who is a 'fan' of the same hospital department as us, and we shared sneaky giggles about the telephone advice line we have locally. Basically if ever you ring them up they say 'You'd better come in for us to have a look at you,' and if you have a Hickman line in (I think there are different types) then you have to stay in until your temp comes down... I know it's really the safe thing to do and I know that nobody wants septicaemia or anything else with an ugly name, but maybe they should call it the 'Do drop in to see us phone line' or sthg? Or maybe we should be pleased they are interested! PS Glad to hear that taking the line out isn't too bad, they sure go in a long way.",
