    "Content": "I have to agree with the majority here, I think a good GP is probably like a needle in a haystack! Don't know how many times I made appts and nothing was ever followed through and then when I had symptoms, referral was delayed as I didn't meet the criteria and there was no way this could be anything sinister! Perhaps I should have asked my GP to explain to my daughters that I have stage 4, terminal cancer - whereas her response when I telephoned was ' who would have thought this would happen - try and stay positive'. Same GP referred neighbour's daughter to hospital with suspect appendix - only problem being it was on the wrong side of the body. Also prescribed my husband with beta blockers without even seeing him. Told my daughter to stop taking caffeine for constant headaches (She only drinks water) and then when I suggested she saw the GP at Uni as a follow up, she was referred to Neurology, thankfully MRI scan clear but didn't really need this lapsed attitude from our surgery on top of my diagnosis. My Oncologist seems to believe my GP should be providing all the emotional support and help but I've only managed to see her once since diagnosis in Sept and that was due to severe panic attacks which had meant I was unable to get up off the sofa, since then nothing. Oh no, I lie, she prescribed some anti depressants without seeing me. No, I have little faith left in most GPs.",
