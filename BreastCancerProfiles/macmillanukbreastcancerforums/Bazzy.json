      "Content": "Hi kacang, I really appreciate your reply. I have had 5 lymph nodes removed and the cancer had not spread. It is hormone. Grade 2. I don\u2019t have anymore information. Oncology said to read all I can about chemotherapy ( not dr Google) as I will probably need it. I\u2019m a little confused. You are right I do need to recover from surgery ( still in some discomfort) and take things 1 step at a time, just hoping I would have my treatment plan now and know what I\u2019m up against. Thank you for listening to me waffle. Xxxx",

Im waiting to see if it\u2019s her2 + so it will go from there. Is it as bad as I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s going to be? How do you cope? I\u2019m sorry for going on, my mind is a bit of a mess at the moment.Â  Thank you for your reply Bazzy Xx",
