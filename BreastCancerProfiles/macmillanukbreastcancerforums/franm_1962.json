Ten years ago I had a mastectomy and 26 lymph nodes remove and there was cancer in two of the nodes. Has anyone had the same, Does anyone know the recovery time for this current one. I have been told that it hasn't spread anywhere else. Thanks Fran",

      "Content": "I have seen the surgeon after having a CT Scan and a full body/bone scan and was told that I have iffy bits on my sternum but nothing to worry about. However he was happy to operate on the lump in the armpit. Had surgery on the 6th July and then was told that the lump was stuck to a main vein and they couldn't get all of it. I have been referred to the oncologist on Friday last week and they were confused because they were told that everything was fine apart from the bit they couldn't get in the armpit. The oncologist has read the scan results and they have a lot of concern about the bits on the sternum and they are having a meeting with the MDT today. As far as the scans are concerned they say that my cancer is incurable. However they are arranging chemo. Shocked to say the least and lots of tears. Not told anyone as I am waiting for confirmation.   Another thing is my right armpit smells on BO every now and then but the one with the surgery doesn't. (strange). The last thing is my husband is texting another woman early in the mornings again. I have confronted him by text this morning and he has said I need to wait until he gets home ha!!!! He has done this before, I don't need the stress.... Lots of love Fran xx ",

I asked for a refresher after being away from the department for 6 months. I have met the target once since coming back and told people that I cant remember things and I think the diabetes tablets have made this worse. This is then causing stress and making me ill so I am off and will be on a stage 2 sickness review. (great). I have no confidence at all. My GP is useless as well and said that I need to get rid of the negativity and try to do other things and then maybe get another job. I have just had a look at the side affects of the tablets and I don't think I should be having the crestor ones. At a loss of what to do. Love Fran xx ",
