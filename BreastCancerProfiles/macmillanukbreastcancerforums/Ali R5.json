      "Content": "Hi Ruthie I've seen you've had lots of  responses and don't know if it will help but sounds like my stats were very similar to yours. Around a 4% benefit with chemo on paper and I opted to go for it and I'm glad I did!!  I've had two surgeries a lumpectomy followed by a second due to tumour being bigger than first thought, 6 cycles of chemo and 4 weeks of radiotherapy. Right now you probably feel like it will never end but it does and you will get through it. It wasn't nice for sure but I got through it one treatment at a time. The way I looked at was not thinking about numbers but people, every number has a face and that's 4 more faces that see another day with chemo. My oncologist said the risk to life was 1 in 100, that said if your sensible look after yourself and do what the docs say you should be ok.  I've got young kids and that pushed me to take all the treatment available. Decide what's best for you it is s tough one hope you find some clarity xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi there I was in a very similar situation a few months ago. All of my results put me in the middle - on the fence. So we waited for the for my oncotype score which came back at 24!! Still more middle ground and the choice about chemo was left to me.  I'm 46 and have young kids so what do you do? I opted for chemo, the oncologist asked me how I'd feel if the cancer came back and I'd not had it? I suppose my thought is I'm doing all I can and whatever the future holds which I am expecting to be good!! my family will know I did everything I could for us. I've  had 3 cycles of fec so far and am due three more of tax. Chemo is hard and scary and leaves me feeling pretty rotten for a good few days but so far so good. We're getting through it one treatment st s time. Ive explained everything to the kids so they know what to expect and they're coping. As difficult as its been I'm not sorry I opted for chemo.  There no right or wrong and I think it's the hardest decision you can make. I hope you find the right way forward for yourself X ",

      "Content": "Hi silvercloud Well done for making your decision,  I don't know when you start your treatment but hope it all goes well. I'd say just talk to the specialist team about any symptoms you have and they will help in any way they can. They've done that for me anyway and it's made a big difference. I couldn't do it without my other half who is there with me for every treatment. We're sticking together like glue through all of this and trying to keep our lives as normal as we can in between treatments. I hope your able to do the same xx",

      "Content": "Hi there Don't know if it will help but I was very sick with my first cycle of fec. For my next two cycles they added in an extra anti sickness tablet called emend, I took it an hour before chemo and then two mornings after as well as the other meds. It stopped me vomiting and helped a lot with the worst symptoms. If you've not had it might be worth asking about xx",
