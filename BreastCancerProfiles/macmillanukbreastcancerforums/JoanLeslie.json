      "Content": "Hello, I asked my oncologist this question as I would rather have my ovaries removed than take tablets like that, as I want to feel as good as possible as soon as possible of course.  He said that was an option, but one would still need tablets, though they could then give different ones rather than Tamoxifen.  He said this is because the ovaries produce about 90 odd percent of the hormone (can't remember the exact number he said).  But the other small percent is made from other things in the body - can't remember which body parts he said either - sorry.  I think it might have been cells, or glands - he mentioned 3 other things that produce small amounts.  Hope that helps a little.  I am also HER2 positive.  I've had the lumpectomy and node clearance at level 1 & 2 on March 6th.  I was told in my follow up that I will need a mastectomy after the chemotherapy due to a couple other areas in the breast. He explained why really well. I was most impressed with his explanations - sorry I can't recall exact details to your questions, but that is why.  :)",
