    "Content": "hello everyone, hope you are all ok.   My partner of 5 years and the father of my two daughters, found a lump under his nipple and his nipple started turning in. he went to the doctors and the doctor said it looks like its early breast cancer. We are currently waiting for a hospital appointment for tests, i am just wondering what to expect as i am terrified, as im sure my partner is too. i watched my nan go through 3 lots of cancer after sadly loosing her 5 years ago, but i only really remember her going through the 3rd one. Any information would be appreciated so much!   Thank you",
