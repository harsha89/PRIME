    "Content": "Hi ladies, I just wanted to thank you all for your amazing support. I have come back from seeing the consultant and my biopsy came back clear. I have a radial scar which needs to be removed and she did say they will have to wait for the pathology report from that before giving me the all clear but she isn\u2019t expecting anything sinister.  I was so relieved and it has made me appreciate all I do have. You ladies are all amazing and I so appreciate being made to feel listened to and supported during the long wait for results.  Biggest hugs to you all",
