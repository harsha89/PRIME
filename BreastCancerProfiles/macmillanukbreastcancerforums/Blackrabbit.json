I have looked at what some of the other ladies have said and looks like it should get better within a few days. I also should have had my hair cut shorter. Yes an emotional day but I am getting through it. My second treatment tomorrow and then four to go before and then Herceptin for a year. Good luck with your treatment Blackrabbit x",

Its good to know the pain will go away in a few days. I will get what is left cut off tonight by my very supportive husband. I love what you say about \"kick cancer in the ar*e lady and not a cancer victim\" I will be sure to do that when I look in the mirror tonight. I see that you have a link to what to take to chemo I am going to read that tonight and go prepared for treatment 2 tomorrow Thanks for the support xx",

I did the head massage as you said and it helped a lot. I decided to go to the hospital in a nice blue maxi dress with a blue turban which i had tied a scarf around. My husand said i looked luvly just before we left home and nurses at the hospital  commented on how nice and summery I looked. Both which were a huge boost and made me feel even more cheerful.
