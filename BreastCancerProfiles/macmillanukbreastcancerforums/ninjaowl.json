      "Content": "On Thursday had a mastectomy and an immediate reconstruction (Tram) plus node clearance. Everything went well and was allowed home yesterday. It was lovely being home but last night was  hard work. I really missed the hospital beds - the ease of rising / lowering you to the right position. I made a nest of pillows behind me and some for my feet but just couldn't get comfy and at one point woke with a pain in my tum - readjusted pillows and got a bit more sleep but still never fully comfy. Ended up moving back downstairs to sleep in the recliner chair - which I think I will have to do for the next few days. I'm interested to know how have others managed after major surgery?",
