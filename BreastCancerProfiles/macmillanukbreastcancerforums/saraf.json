      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and it is also in my lymph nodes (both lumps 3cm) in October, this is after being told in 2006 the lump in my breast was a breast mouse and nothing to worry about, I have since questioned the oncologist about this and his response was \"we may have got it wrong\"!. My Doctor recommended chemo first as it is in my lymph nodes and (in his words) said there will be cancer cells floating round in my blood so we need to zap them, then surgery, then radiotherapy. Now I have been fine with all of this, I'm continuing to work as and when I can (am self employed), have shaved my head and have generally been really positive (even though my best friend died of bone and liver cancer after continuing to get the all clear from breast cancer as they didn't know it had spread!!) but for some reason for the last few days I've been having a 'wobble' about the whole cancer cells floating around my body thing as my way of thinking is..... if there are cells floating around from the lymph nodes then there still will be after chemo as there will be a wait for surgery after chemo which means the cancer is still in my lymph nodes, am I making mountains out of mole hills?? Sorry this is soooo long!",

      "Content": "Hi Lonefox, I have had taxotere first and apart from the general aches and pains and a slight temperature its been ok, no sickness or digestive problems or real tiredness, they do give you lots of tablets to take to ensure you dont suffer too much with side effects. Got my last tax on Tuesday and then start FEC. Good luck with it all sara x",
