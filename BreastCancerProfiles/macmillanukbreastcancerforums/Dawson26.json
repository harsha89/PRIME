      "Content": "Thank you Carolyn for replying.  Yes he seems well thought of but it has me really concerned. She will be going to this appt alone. I live in England she lives in Scotland. If she gets told bad news she will be alone :(  I can't shake the fact it must be bad news for her to be seeing someone like an Oncoplastic Surgeon...",

      "Content": "Hi all I am just looking for some advice please. My mum had a mammogram 2 weeks ago. She had been having some intermittent breast pain so was referred to the breast clinic. She is 66. She received a letter offering her an appointment with a Mr Massannat at Aberdeen Breast Clinic. I have just googled him and it states he is an Oncoplastic surgeon. The letter is a standard letter, but I am now worried sick as to why she would be having an appointment with him. If she had the all clear why would he be seeing her? Her appt isn't until Saturday but she is panicking (she doesn't know I've googled him) I purely did it to try and put her mind at ease but it hasn't helped at all! ",
