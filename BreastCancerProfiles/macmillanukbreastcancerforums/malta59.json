    "Content": "Hi Sheila. While I, too, am new to this forum, I am not \"new\" to BC. I was diagnosed Stage IV, with mets to lungs and bones in March 2010 and thought then that I was \"on my way out\". Pleased to say I'm still around and \"managing\" with this. As for PICC...I actually had a Portacath inserted, which for me personally, was the best thing. I would venture to say that in addition to it being a personal choice (massive phobia about needles) the decision might also hinge on frequency and number of infusions to go through. In my case, I had chemotherapy treatments every week for an entire year. In addition to the needle \"fear factor\" what I researched, read, and was informed of, convinced me that the minor discomfort of the procedure far outweighed the alternatives. As I continue to receive infusions of zometa and avistan every three weeks, I remain convinced that the portacath continues to be the best solution for me. As for the actual chemo, I was extremely fortunate. It was no where near as incapacitating as I had imagined. Yes, there were quite a few side effects that occured during the process, some minor irritations, others a bit worrisome. All in all though, things were manageable and not nearly as bad as I anticipated. The key thing was to keep track of any/all issues and discuss them with the medical team. In addition to medications that combat the SEs, there were quite a few herbal and holistic supplements that definitely helped. Stay strong.....",
