    "Content": "Hi Mia and the rest of you It is so helpful to read your experiences. I am 40 (just!) and was diagnosed at the end of Jan with grade 2 BC. It's hormonal so no chemo for me, have been on tamoxifen for three weeks and they are also giving me a gasorelin acetate injection (another hormone blocker) which will put me into menopause effectively - have my 2 kids so that doesn't bother me. The lump is big, 7cm (I nearly died when they sadi that!) so the aim is to reduce it ahead of surgery. Apparently in the tests they did after the biopsy, it reacted 'very well' to hormone therapy so the consultant seemed positive. I met my oncologist for the first time last week and he said we'll know where we're at in three months' time - i'll know if it's going to be a full masectomy or not in other words. I'm in Ireland so things may be done different - everyone else I read about has surgery or chemo first and then tamoxifen, I seem to be doing everything backwards lol. Anyway, it's scary stuff all right although I'm keeping positive and getting on with things day to day - sure what choice do you have with kids, work etc? Because I've had no chemo and no side-effects to speak of fwith the tamoxifen, I feel quite 'normal' and look no different - I don't even have to tell people unless i choose to. I don't know how to feel about masectomy really - in some ways I feel they should just take it off so the risk is gone but any form of surgery frightens the life out of me as I was only ever in hospital to give birth before this - but you just have to put your faith in the docs and take it one day at a time I guess. Sites like this really do help. xx",
