    "Content": "Hi Megan After my mastectomy Iwas put on zoladex and tamoxifen. Zoladex for two years and tamoxifen, that I´m still taking for five years. The reason for the zoladex being that my cancer was hormone ´fed´, and so zoladex is a hormone suppressant which basically means you don´t produce the hormones that could ´trigger´another bout of cancer. Apart from the annoyance of having to administer it monthly, I injected myself, and the fact my life was one huge hot flush, I didn´t really have any major problems with it. Nowit´s finished it´s just one ex bad dream! My specialist did however test me for the likelihood of getting osteosporosis, see I can´t spell either! which had I tested positive he would have treated pre condition,but I was lucky and didn´t have a problem. I´m sorry to hear that, on top of your initial illness you are now having to deal with another. Why have you have you been on zoladex so long ? Are you quite young? this could be why, because I was borderline menopause so possibly two years was enough for me. Good luck for the future love patri",
