My oncologist changed me to Exemestane and \\i have to say , it is a lot better . Maybe it would be worth asking about this? I was actually on the point of just not taking letrozole - it was so depressing. Cheers",

I know cats live in a world of smell ( didnt know sheep did ) and i have heard that animals can be useful with detecting chemical changes - like epilepsy but fancy your cat doing that. Yes, take note if she does it again though of course she may have just got to like the bed.  The smell and taste thing is very weird. Mine went odd in hospital while i was having reconstruction but i guess it was the anaesthetic and the weird microwaved food.  Cigerette smoke not too bad for me - slight pangs sometimes as an ex smoker - but the smell of fag smoke on peoples clothes is awful. My hospital driver smokes and i can tell instantly someone gets in the car if they are a smoker or not. Many of them are - its almost like smoking makes you ill......maybe i should tell someone haha I guess we are all a mass of chemicals and cancer, treatment and things like stress just alter it and make us react in different ways. Maybe the cat was trying to figure it out or thought you needed help. Maybe there is something in me that is picking up a burning smell unrelated to cigarettes. I wonder if we understood it more whether it could help? ",

But I went at it too intensly and now have a stress fracture in foot. Probably something to do with bone thinning effect as well. So am hobbling about on crutches and am really cross about it. So, slow and steady, little by little. Apparently stress fractures really common in people who increase activity levels quickly. According to advice online from Boots, you should only increase activity by bout 10% a weeek.",

Bedford69 will increase the swimming i think. Sounds good. Glad its helped. But i love running and would like to get back to it in few months.

I went alone for first one but what worked for me was people coming in for the subsequent sessions - like for a few hours in the afternoon and then taking me home. You might find that works for yr daughter - maybe for next time. The cold cap adds time and makes it harder but it is worth it in my opinion. It is fine after the first 20 minutes. Foodwise - they do keep offering drinks and snacks at chemo....personally i felt ok during it but it does depend on what yr drugs are. I got side effects a few days after and  then had weird fancies....most drastically cravings for chinese takeaway but again i guess it depends on the drugs. I really hate fuss so just wanted to get with it alone. Sometimes youve just got to do whats best for you.....i reallt appreciated neing looked after once i got home though.

      "Content": "Hi all, Hi Silvercloud I didnt really think that there was much difference statistically in my case between having chemo and not having chemo either so I get what you say.. However my oncologist seemed to think that I should go for it, and on that basis mainly I am doing it now.   I mean it is hard enough having to go through this anyway without having to make these sorts of choices. (grumble mode)  Dont know about you but if I get a mechanic in to fix the car , the mechanic should know how to do it, not give me options. I just want the car to be fixed hopefully in a way that will last for a while. I can't see why the medical lot can't do the same. Make the choice based on the training and the evidence. Not leave it up to people who have to go from 0 to 60 in a medical learning curve.... I dont think these oncologists should play around like this. They ought to know what they are doing. They are trained. They should be able to make an informed decision about what is best, based on what we tell them.  Now, I am having this chemo and it is pretty dreadful and all along I'm thinking, so did I really need this anyway? Why did he recommend it? And in a way it is making it all a lot worse. That said, it will pass and am sure I will recover and I don't want to make a fuss. But this stuff obviously is not good for you. At the end of the day I could not go against the advice so went with it.... as LondonLass says there is no right or wrong answer....all the best to you too by the way...and to all of us....",

However due to complicated reasons i am not in my own home but staying with extremely small and healthy cousins who dont eat ....and i am marooned in the middle of the countryside . It is actually quite awful. I usually have a varied and healthy diet and am easygoing if staying elsewhere but i cant make them understand that a bit of so called unhealthy food would be great for morale. The other day i was faced with cheese and ryvita for lunch....can you imagine anything more depressing ...and although i usually eat a lot of fruit i am not enjoying it now. Just makes the side effects worse.... Sorry, got onto a heart felt rant here but all i can say is just eat what you want and what your body tells you. Plenty of time to get back to normal. Plenty of time to count calories and all that....one thing i am mad on is green tea. I can recommend that. To me it tastes like ordinary tea but ordinary tea tastes sickly ( milk). In my opinion there is nothing worse than people telling you to eat stuff because it is good for you. I know it is meant kindly but i enjoy my food, like cooking i lived in france for years and am finding it all a bit depressing good positive mental attitude is important and food part of the cure! .

I was so nervous ( frightened) before my op - it is a big thing. But these people know what they are doing and will have done it before loads of times.  Luckily the rather dishy anesthetist told me that  1 - they would make sure I was out for the count and yes if I did start waking up they would know about it.I had read a horror story in the daily mail about a woman who woke up in an operation but apparently they don't use that sort of anaesthetic in a DIEP op. And 2 the fact that my throat felt that I couldn't breathe was just a stress reaction.  Once it is over the recovery begins. Long time since I have had to deal with small children but I do think it can be beneficial to have them understand that sometimes even mum needs a bit of help. So she will probably enjoy doing little things for you - even if it is only drawing you a picture or telling people to mind your boob.  x",

Everything is fine though I do feel very tired sometimes but i guess that is normal. But I am really worried now. My recon boob has become a bit tender under my arm and although it looks the same , it feels different. It feels artificial and seems to drag down and I am  more aware of it than i was. I have a routine mammogram next week so not much longer to wait but i am really worried.  I am currently despising myself and rightly so. I stupidly had a small period of smoking for 2 months ( end of october to last week and anything you think and say I already know) I thought i could control it to 1 occasionally but it escalated and  the next thing \\I was buying them and hiding them away. Nobody knew about it. The lengths i have been to ,to conceal it and I'm glad it;s over now. My feeling is that I have now compromised my reconstruction.So it might be too late. What was I thinking of?  Of course it might not be that. I have been swimming a lot ( was on holiday last week) and did help push a very heavy man in a wheelchair. I also lifted cases etc. It does seem to have come on quite suddenly - following these activities.  Any advice please? Has anyone noticed the diep getting more noticeable after 6 months. It does seem to have dropped a bit. I thought i was an ex smoker for good but learned it only takes one....I am an ex smoker for good now but i am panicking it is too late. ",

You must be wondering when will it ever end and get back to normal.... I  am just replying because i am wondering if you need some professional help with this. You know your moods are extreme yet you can't help it. I am close to someone who has depression and a lot of this is caused by chemical imbalances and physical reasons rather than circumstances. Of course life is difficult sometimes but we must be strong and i just wondered if it would help to actually see a profesional about this. Sometimes physcology or more likely sometimes medication can help. I know this probably sounds not what is expected.....go for a walk...dance like nobodys watching etc.....but although these things can help, you know all that already and it still isnt working.
