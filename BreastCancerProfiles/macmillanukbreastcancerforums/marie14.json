      "Content": "Hi everyone I hope you all don't mind me asking for advice but I gained so much support from this site when my mum was diagnosed Dec 14. After chemo and radiotherapy and anastrozole my mums cancer has recurred in the same breast. She has had operation but surgeon was unable to get clear margins.Â  She is currently discussing treatment options with oncologist but wondered if anyone else has dealt with this? If so I would appreciate any advice. My mum is obviously distraught and I want to help her. Thankyou",
