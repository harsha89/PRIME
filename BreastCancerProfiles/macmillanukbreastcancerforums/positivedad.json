    "Content": "Hello there. I hope I\u2019m posting this message on the correct forum. It has been suggested to me that it might be a good place to get some support and advice. I am a carer for my wife who will be commencing chemotherapy this week after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 18. Her treatment will be FEC-T which I understand is a common treatment for breast cancer. I am feeling anxious as is my wife about the possible side effects she is going to experience so thought that maybe this could be a place to communicate with others? Best wishes",
