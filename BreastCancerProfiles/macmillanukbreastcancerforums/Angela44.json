Many thanks Angela",

      "Content": "Hi all, Really interested to hear all your thoughts and advice.  I too have a diep planned for April - am feeling very anxious as I had my mastectomy over 3 years ago, so it feels daunting to go back for more surgery.  My reconstruction has been delayed as I have had a frozen shoulder - which has taken 2 years to get better (and is not 100% even now).  I chose to have a delayed reconstruction as it was likely I would need radiotherapy - which I did - so it was a good call to go down the delayed route.  I now have a persistent cough and breathlessness - so it may get delayed even longer - we shall see.  Those who have had their reconstruction - it would be good to hear about your recovery time, post surgery.  My niece is getting married in May and wondering whether I'll be able to go - 3 weeks after the surgery? Those who have their surgery coming up I wish you the very best outcome and a speedy recovery.  The prospect is very daunting and it doesn't help if you have people around you questioning your decision to go ahead with a long operation and saying 'well, you seem fine as you are'! Look forward to hearing from you all. ",

      "Content": "Hi,  have just read your post and replies.  I think it is a very personal decision - everyone's cancer and circumstances are different.  It is helpful to hear people's personal stories - and they will be both positive and negative.  I am 56 and had a mastectomy on one side only about 15 months ago, all lymph nodes removed, then chemo and radiotherapy (tumour was 10 cm diameter).  I am planning reconstruction later this year (which I am carefully considering the pros and cons of!).  My one piece of advice about whether to have immediate or delayed reconstruction is that if you are likely to need radiotherapy afterwards (and you won't know for sure beforehand) then you are best having delayed reconstruction.  The reason is because radiotherapy is very damaging on tissue (although it doesn't hurt) and will damage the newly reconstructed tissue. Often hard tissue is formed around either the new tissue or around any sort of implant and this becomes painful and usually requires further surgery later down the line to remove it.  So delayed reconstruction is much more preferable if you are likely to have radiotherapy after surgery.  I had planned to have immediate reconstruction - but changed my mind at the last minute when I became aware of this.  It is very difficult to make some of these decisions and you can only do your own research and then make the best decision for you.  There are two services that I have found really helpful in my own decision making process. 'Someone like me'  at Breast Cancer Care  can put you in touch with someone similar to you in age and type of cancer and circumstance and you can talk to them over the phone.  Also 'Keeping Abreast' which has support groups around the country who meet up and support each other - this is specifically for people who have had or who are considering reconstruction.  Bilateral mastectomy is not something that I  have considered as my surgeon has not particularly recommended it.  I think for me the chances are much greater that my current cancer will spread rather than developing a new cancer in the other breast.  I hope this is helpful  and I really wish you the very best in whatever you decide.",

Does anyone have any experience of having radiotherapy on newly transplanted tummy tissue or an implant first and then a later operation once radiotherapy finished?? Many thanks",

      "Content": "In the last two weeks I have had various tests, including mammography, ultrasound and MRI.  I have been told I have ductal- type breast cancer and because I have several small tumours in my left breast I will need to have a mastectomy (the right one is thankfully ok). My dilemma is whether to go ahead with treatment at my local hospital or be referred to a more specialist hospital.  I live in North London.  My confidence in my local hospital is pretty poor - as they missed sending me for further tests when I went to see them in March. It was only my persistence in asking my GP to make another referral (and she was reluctant) that has brought me to needing this treatment now.  In March the breast clinic at my local hospital  sent me away saying there was nothing to worry about as they could not feel any lumps (but breast was visibly looking different - dimpled and nipple pulled in) and because I had only had my routine mammogram the previous August - they felt further tests were unnecessary. I have now been back to my GP to ask to be referred to a specialist hospital in London - they have said this is possible but will delay things by at least 2 weeks. Should I go with my local hospital and get the treatment sooner - or go with a specialist hospital which will delay things?? Would appreciate any thoughts on this decision many thanks",
