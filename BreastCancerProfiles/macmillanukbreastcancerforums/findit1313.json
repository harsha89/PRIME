      "Content": "hiya,    I'm on tamoxifen and zoladex jab (montly). After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, I've had a mastectomy, and 6 rounds of chemo. I noticed weight gain during chemo, and wish I would of known then that I could of asked for the amount of steroids in my chemo to be reduced, which may have prevented some weight gain. I weighed 9 stone when diagnosed and am now 12 stone. Chemo was over a year ago, and I can't seem to loose any weight at all.    I've tried pills, liquid diet, one meal a day, and am now on a sensible no carb diet. I haven't lost a single pound in a month of constant dieting. I'm so unhappy with how my body looks, and have had to buy a new wardrobe since I can't fit into any of my old cloths.    Does anyone else have this issue? or have found a diet that actually works while taking tamoxifen and zoladex?    Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the responses here, it seems there are a lot of us in the same fat boat. Not sure why they didn't get forwarded to my inbox,  but oh well.  Fiona j, your hilarious! Its good to have a sense of humor through all this, or we'd all probably go mad. I've done the exercise and diet regime, to no avail. I've tried pillates, zumba, and purchased an exercise bike that I rode for an hour a day. Still no weight loss.  At my first meeting with the oncologist after chemo was over, I expressed to her how upset I was about the weight gain. She told me not to be concerned, unless I start gaining lots of fat in the abdominal area. Well, for the most part, that's where most of the excess fat has settled. She said if you get to fat in the mid section, you will create more estrogen, and in my case (estrogen positive cancer) that's not a good thing. As much as I sweat on a regular basis now, I guess I use that as an excuse not to exercise as much as I should. Just carrying a bag of groceries home (15 min. walk) causes me to almost always have to change my shirt and bra because of the sweat. Its disgusting. For the life of me I can't understand whats happened to my body, that I can't shed a pound. Is the tamoxifen preventing it, and how the h*ll is that possible? I'm guessing my metabolism no longer exists, and that isn't helping me on my weight loss journey either. Not sure how to get that back.  Tomorrow I go in for (hopefully) my final reconstruction surgery, and another episode of liposuction. Had it done with the last reconstruction surgery and can't see any results.... sad..   Thanks to all who have responded, your all a great group of people :-)  ",
