      "Content": "Hello,  I am hoping to find out if some strange symptoms I\u2019ve been having could possibly indicate breast cancer.  I\u2019m 35 and recently went to the doctor with a very itchy nipple and was referred to a breast clinic. While there I also mentioned some dimpling on the underneath of the itchy breast. The consultant then found a small lump in the same area that I never would have found myself.  The lump is hard and doesn\u2019t move, it almost feels like a frozen pea. They have taken a fine needle biopsy (although with the lump being so small and hard to feel I\u2019m not sure how they could get a very accurate biopsy) and advised results could take 5-6 weeks and to wait to hear about an ultrasound appointment.  The thing is I\u2019m struggling to find much info on the nipple symptoms I\u2019m having. As well as the itching, which feels like it\u2019s behind the nipple but not the rest of the breast, I\u2019m also getting sporadic moments of numbness. It almost feels like that nipple isn\u2019t attached to me.  I have also noticed that the end of the nipple is a different colour to the other. Especially when it gets cold and goes hard. Then the very end of the nipple goes a yellow white colour. I stopped breast feeding 5 months ago and the itching started 2-3 months after that so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s connected in some way.  Im curious about the nipple blanching and going white. The skin of the nipple is normal, with no dryness or rashes.  Any information would be very much appreciated.  Thank you.",

I was really shocked when I was told it could be so long but just accepted it but I\u2019m thinking about it all the time now.  It\u2019s been nearly 3 weeks and still no ultrasound appointment either so I\u2019m going to take your advice and chase it up tomorrow.  Thank you all for taking the time to reply Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Lindynew,  Thank you, I have come across it on my relentless google searches (I know I shouldn\u2019t but can\u2019t stop looking!) so I\u2019m hoping the lump and dimpling arent anything to worry about and I can get referred to someone who might be able to test for Raynaud\u2019s. I just wondered if my symptoms were ever a sign of pagets but as the skin is still soft it doesn\u2019t seem that way hopefully.  Thanks again xxx",
