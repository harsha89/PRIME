I'm onto Radiotherapy now , had the neccessary bits chopped off, had the poison poured into my veins, then the neutropenic stays in hospital, now the frying ,soon the tamoixfen and even if I do say so myself handled (most of it) with a big brave smile, I worried about how my children and family would handle it so I stayed brave until now. I could easily be a wreck but I dare not shown any emotion because if I did I would scream the house down ! I'm so so tired , I hate the constant trips to the hospital, last week got told I had lymphoedema, this week a glucose intolerance  next week will my big toe drop off ? I hate the person I am with my lovely husband. There's no way around it CANCER SUCKS ! I'm looking forward to having all this behind me and like you beevergirl getting back to been someone worth been around. Sending you a big hug xx",

My husband and I have only been married five years and sadly in the last year I have had an unsuccessful knee replacement, followed only weeks later by a serious stroke which thankfully I have made a full recovery from and then only a few months later breast cancer. The strained on our relationship has become unbearable, we are argue constantly, sniping then we tip toe around each other not daring to upset the other. It\u2019s awful and the stress on top of the cancer is just too depressing for me.I try and be upbeat about everything but I have been hospitalised on 6 occasions and my lovely partner has felt I guess guilty as on 2 occasions I had to ring for help as I was unable to wake him. We have been sleeping separately for some time, so I think you can guess what else as has fallen by the wayside. I have no inclination to have sex but my partner still does. (I know too much information!) it\u2019s got to the point where we rarely kiss or cuddle. I just wondered has anyone else had similar problems. Is there somewhere can we go for help. We love each other dearly but the strained is enormous. Sorry if this is very forward Amanda x",

But my hot flushes mean that I\u2019m dripping with sweat most of the time so any creams are just slipping off, I had my Hickman line removed 3 weeks ago, it was always infected and the area was always very sore but now this is the area been treat to radiotherapy and the scar from the line is red raw, my removed breast has always felt numb as does the area under my arm ( I had 41 lymph nodes removed) is that the same for everyone ? Will I ever be able to feel under my arm or my missing breast area?

My daughter was getting married in June and I was so determined that she had a lovely day. I had been to the GP alot I had a bad cough that wont go away and pains in my neck but nothing wrong with me except arthritus. It was getting worse in May I gave up my degree course, there was just no way I could continue, 5 times up till then at the GP's. I phoned my oncologist please please do something about the pain, i was finally booked in for a bone scan. The bone scan confirmed several areas of cancer throughout the spine but not the neck. I told the oncologist i could hardly move my neck he said no problem with your neck its refferred pain.CT scan was order as a precaution and I was told to return in 2 months when a treatment plan would be explained. Three weeks later i was told to go to clinic immeadiately so I was there 9.30 am next morning where i was rushed into a neck brace and told i was to have an emergency operation to fuse my c1-4 vertebras together as cancer has eaten it way through and my neck was in danger of collaspe. I asked for them to give me a full story of what is going on, he replied he wasnt sure yet and he needed to refer me to another consultant but that in 2 days I was to have a major operation. I got out of hospital  totally bewilled yes I definely have secondary bone cancer 'throughout my spine ' but i know nothing more. I do not have any follow up appointments, i have phoned the breast care nurses, oncology team and left a message for one of the breast cancer consultant and within the last 2 weeks i have heard nothing.  I feel like I am dying my pain and now that of my newly operated neck is awful, i am taking morphine. If theses are to be my last weeks, days, months then I want to know so that i can plan , enjoy or just be. Does anyone know what I can do? I have never joined a support group but i notice theres one at my local hospital this tuesday Im sorry about the grammar and spelling trying to think clearly through morphine doses.            ",

My operation is 13th Jan I delayed it by a week as I going to have a great hoilday before all this kicks in. I dont know how long anyone should wait be its been over 2 months for me. Or if you count the 6 weeks (end of sept before) when i went to my Gp and she told me it was nothing ! Lobular cancer i have been told is very hard to find, then grade and then to know the best way to operate. You know we have enough to worry about at the minute so just trust that your consultant knows what he is doing. I also wonder if everything slows down for Christmas. Here's hoping for successful operations for the both of us.",

I think you should give yourself a big chocolate or alcohol treat just for been able to work during chemo and look after your daughter well I think your Superwoman, I'm whacked most of the time, started knitting squares for a blanket that how exciting my life is lol. I did do some gardening today hurrah ! Sending your blood a big hug !",

      "Content": "Hello Irene I have been neutropenic on both of my two treatments, first after 6 days following the treatment, I was in hospital for 5 days given antibotics and injections to increase levels. i did have an oral thrush infection quite bad and yes they did delay the next round of treatment by a week. On my second treatment, neutropenic after 5 days back in hospital for 6 days on IV antibotics but no sign of infection and my chemo went ahead as planned about 10 days later. So it might well depend on whether you get an infection or not. I'm surprised you have not been admitted though. Had my third treatment 6 days ago and so far so good although chronic constipation is driving me mad ! Good luck to you and hope you have a fab break ! Amanda ",

      "Content": "Hiya , I was just wondering if anyone has had problems with the expanders? I had 100mm lobular cancer and 41 lymph nodes removed and at the same time had an expander fitted. I appreciate that it was a big operation but the expander has been so uncomfortable, I feel like I have broken ribs. I had some fluid build up below the expander which hasnt helped and my consultant does not want to remove the fluid but to remove the expander instead ( next thurs) If i had known how painful the expander was going to be I would not have had it fitted, everyone is different but just wondered if anyone else has had the same problem?",
