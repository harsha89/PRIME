    "Content": "Hi DebBee25 so sorry to hear your news. Got to admit, when i found out i had oesophagial cancer the only thing i was scared of was telling my children. The older 2 ( 21 & 19 ) although difficult was the easiest part. telling my younger 2 ( 12 & 10 ) scared the hell out of me. However i decided it was best to be totally honest with them. Although they come to my home at weekends and holidays they are not daft and would have noticed the change in my life style and working habits. it was the younger 2 that actually pursaded me to go to the docs in the 1st place because they noticed i was struggling when eating. my decision to be honest went better than i expected. I explained my diagnosise along with my prognosis. As well as any treat i would be having and could also end up having. So they knew everthing before it happened.  Remember. Kids always know when parents are trying to hide something and although none of us want to tell out babies we have joined this horrible club. Just remember. The hardest part is not actually telling our children BUT the thought of telling them. Hope this helps Best wishes And lots of love John  ",
