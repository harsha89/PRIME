    "Content": "Hi Linda When I had my mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in feb I was told to wear the beige front fastening bra the hospital gave me for support. My bra did not dig in if anything it was a little uncomfortable due to the swelling of the recon. However if you are feeling discomfort like you mentioned perhaps a visit to your BC nurse or a phone call if you are unable to get someone to take you to see her. Even though I am small chested I still wear a bra in bed otherwise my recon breast feels really unomfortable. Hope this helps. Lilly.",
