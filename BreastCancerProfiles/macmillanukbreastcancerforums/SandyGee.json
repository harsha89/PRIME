    "Content": "Hi CJo  Just read your post about docetaxel flushing. Can I ask how long it took to improve?  I have had for 6 weeks since my chemo finished and been taking piriton. It helped a bit but not so much now. I have puffiness now with it and a numbness like after the dentist jag feeling. Bit concerned.  Regards SG ",
