      "Content": "Hi, Just wanted to say it is really helpful to read this thread and hear from you all.  I am seeing my chemo oncologist on Monday to hear what's next as I took part in the Optima trial and have been told that I won't be doing chemo after all which is great news, and I know from my surgeon - mastectomy, recon and axillary clearance, that the next stop is Radio Therapy.  Not sure what happens next, if I get passed onto another oncologist for that or what, or how long it is all going to take to get started, or what sort of treatment they will have in mind so I wanted to look and see what the next steps will be.  I am only 5 weeks post op so not lifting my arm up above my head yet, so I assume that it will be a few weeks before I start, but it is really, really helpful to know what might be next. I have been back to work a little since the op and hope to phase back into full time over the next couple of weeks, does anyone know how feasible working is whilst having RT, I am also a single mum - see profile.  I want to get back to work, and need to financially, but also want to make sure I don't over face myself and go backwards, this weekend has been a bit of a case in point as I have been more emotional and teary than ever, and sore. All advice gratefully received. Thank you.  And Tigermom, you are doing amazing, what you have been through is huge. Hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hi there, Just seen this post and delighted by it as I have just recently been diagnosed with Breast Cancer, next step is full mastectomy of right breast and removal of lymph nodes as it is already in them, and I am going to see the consultant tomorrow to agree to the surgery. I want to go for immediate reconstruction if possible ( he did suggest it) with implant, and as I am losing my nipple, I am holding out the hope that once this is all over I can have something pretty tatooed on my reconstructed breast rather than a nipple.  I know my breast is going, and that anything in its place won't look the same so I sort of want to celebrate that in itself - odd I know - celebrate seems like a strange way of putting it.  I thought I was the only 'crazy' one who wanted to do this, so it is great to see I am not alone. Any advice from any of you guys about the next steps would be great to hear, it is all a bit daunting at the moment. Thank you xxx",

      "Content": "Hi. I\u2019m also a few weeks further on and whilst I am just post mastectomy now - still only a matter of days since I really remember that awful time during the diagnosis process. It is very scary and no matter how many people tell you they have or know someone who has been through it and they are fine now. That doesn\u2019t really help. Because this is happening to you and it is scary right now it is terrifying and it doesn\u2019t seem to leave your brain it just lurks there. Meanwhile you maybe frantically trying to get things done and organised before treatment starts so it is stressful too on a practical level.  I could say you\u2019ll be fine and it gets better - it does sort of or at least it changes. But what might help too is to say; be really kind to yourself. Let people you know and love know how you are feeling and if you can let them listen and support you. Also. You are allowed to be scared. Giving yourself permission to feel this way might make it more manageable. You aren\u2019t alone though. And I really hope that you see the clinic again soon to find out your next steps. The limbo stops then for a bit. Ohh and if you need to. Call the breast care nurses at your breast clinic. They know your diagnosis, your situation, and what the care might look like a bit. They might be able to help.  Go well and take care xxx",

Op went well and it is much better than I had imagined. Today I\u2019ve even travelled across half the country alone on train and buses to get away for a few days so I must be almost there now. And I am hoping to get back to work next week. I would just say though give yourself lots of time afterwards to recover.

      "Content": "Dear Henty, I realise that today has gone by and you will have had your pre-med, sorry for not coming on line sooner. Been a bit of a couple of days for me, just logistics, coming back from Northumberland and then hospital appointments today but really sorry not to have been in touch sooner. Hope all went really well for pre-op.  I don't know about you but when your surgery is jumped on you like that it is so scary and then you have to get through the pre-op because for some reason the operation is supposed to happen fast which makes it scarier and more important. I hope it all went well because I bet you were worried.. If you can and like you I had my pre-op just two days before the op, please try and do something tomorrow which will help you breathe.. I went to the beach.  My go to place, but do whatever helps, bake, walk, talk, run whatever, it doesn't matter, just try and get some time where you know you are being fed, restored, replenished and you are not just giving out to others.  ( I do know the other people matter in our lives right now, more probably than ever, but I'm afraid you also need time for you right now, just to get you through.)  Despite the operation being a really huge thing for me, it was fine, the aneasthetist was amazing - do you know their job is to keep you asleep and then make sure you are pain free - pretty cool if you ask me, talk to her/him and she should reassure you.  The operation went well for me and I was so surprised that I still felt something in that area when I woke up, it will still be your skin and your body, it is just the implant that is new.  In my case too the ward knew precisely what they were dealing with which was so reassuring.  You will be ok.  That is not to say that too this is huge and I am just beginning to acknowledge that too.  Hopefully they will tell you to take it really easy for a good few weeks.  I am still not allowed to drive and I am four weeks in.  This is good time, time to not fret (ok I have been but realise it isn't helpful), and try and let people look after you, while your body and mind and emotions begin to get to grip with it all. I will be thinking of you on Thursday, do you know if you are morning or afternoon and I will say a prayer too.  Tight hugs, and gentle ones later.  Hope you are ok. xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Angela, Just saw your other posts.  On top of everythng else, I wonder if the secretary had any idea how impactful her hesitation on your date would be for you.  It may all be fine still.  It could be that the pencil mark is only a pencil mark for her and the surgeon has it inked in in her head.  I do hope so for your sake, it is ages ago that you were given the date and it has been a long enough wait for you. Yes saw oncologist today and she confirmed the great news that because I was one of the lucky ones tested in the Optima trial, I won't be doing chemo.  So wish the trial could finish so that this testing was available for everyone.  It doesn't mean that there is definitely no cancer travelling around my body, just that the cancer itself wouldn't be affected by chemo, so kind of a double edged sword there.  Delighted not to be doing chemo, but slightly scared that this means that chemo won't work.  That said, she has put me on HT, Anastrozole for five years, with bone scan soon hopefully as I have arthritis already and a family history of OP.  In the meantime too I have been referred back to the radio oncologist so that I can start getting on with that, not sure when I will hear from them, but seem to be in a lull now for a bit til that all starts again.  First appointment with the physio's on Wednesday so that will be good, I haven't seen them since the op, been doing the excercises on the diagram, but it will be good to go through them with a human and also maybe see how to move things on, and also what to do when it hurts - arm especially. Keep me posted.  Hope you get hold of the BCC tomorrow. Lots of love and hugs Sophie xxx",

I will be thinking of you on Thursday but in the meantime, if it all gets too much just message, I have this on my feed so I get updates via email and we are here for you.  I hope all is well for you, but cannot deny how real and true it is right now.  If I have any advice to give it is to give those you love around you extra hugs, and just be exceptionally kind to yourself.  It can feel as if you are looking into an abyss.  It is, but there are many routes through the abyss even if that is the diagnosis on thursday.  We have all found them or as in my case are starting to.  It is hard and it is scary and you are held by us all as we rally around you.  Take courage sister, be kind to yourself and gather yourself for what may or may not come.  Very big hugs xxxx",

      "Content": "H Sunshine 19, Sorry it has taken me a little while to get back to you, I am now in the most wonderful place in the world - Holy Island, I may post something about it later.  It is bright sunshine and the sea all around and for the first time in months I can almost breathe.  Although it still hurts a bit when I do - recon still a little sore.  Which leads me onto your question. I had implant recon which seems to have gone really well.  I'm quite slight so tummy flap wasn't an option and they don't do the back one in my hospital which would have meant going further afield, and a more extensive operation, and I just wasn't sure really.  So implant it was.  As I am not huge, I think the surgeon placed it under rather than over my pectoral muscle and it is also sitting in a pig skin sling inside - can't remember the name of it, but basically that is there to support the implant.  I am stunned by how well it looks really.  It is my skin over the implant and apart from the fact I have no nipple (tumour was right under it) and some really very considerable bruising it looks pretty fab.  In fact last night I went out wearing a dress which shows a little cleavage and honestly noone would know. It isn't quite the same shape or size as my other breast when I am naked, and of course it feels different, but not that bad actually now that I am getting used to it.  It does take a while to get used to it though. Sounds like you have really been finding it hard, I am not surprised it is pretty tough.  Don't forget a few weeks ago the world looked normal, now you are living with having cancer, treatment, a major operation, the loss of your breast, a whole host of other things and a lot of unknown stuff too as you wait for diagnosis, op date, op, op results etc.  This is pretty huge.  I know there are some incredibly brave woment out there, and most of them seem to come online here sometimes too which is lovely, but I don't feel brave most of the time and I doubt many of them do either.  (there may be a few super-women, who do and I would love to know how). Even when I think I am doing well, I flunk it.  Yesterday despite managing to travel all the way up to Northumberland by train and bus, I then lost my purse with everything in it, cards, cash and even my implant registration number card - hellllllllp.  Retraced my steps about twenty times, called the bus company, went into every shop, pub and hotel in Bamburgh and it still hasn't turned up.  I felt so scared, and so vulnerable, especially alone, without a car and no money.  I also have spent about a day beating myself up about it, but I think it is time I stopped.  The people in the village I have to say were really kind and I managed because of them and the bank being really helpful too. So be as kind to yourself as you can, if there is anything you can do to give yourself a bit of a break, please do, if anyone offers you help and you can take it, do, and be gentle on yourself as well if you can - Oh and eating - one thing I have found that helps is eating without realising your doing it if you know what I mean, sort of having some very small nibbly things about, so it isn't a meal as such, it's just you walk past a small dish of seeds/nuts/dried fruit/mini chocolate eggs/biscuits/cut up chocolate brownie/cheese whatever you fancy and as you do you sort of take a bit and eat it.  It has worked for me, might do for you, and keep the tea flowing too, fluids help and a good cup of tea can go a long way. Hope this is all helpful. Have a very lovely Easter - oh hot cross buns and butter - that is another one for the nibbling dish. Blessings and hugs",

So so glad to hear that you are still going to have the op next Thursday, it sounds as if you will hopefully be first on the list, that would be even better.  I will be thinking of you then and also so happy to hear that you shouldn't need any other treatment going on from that.  I hope you have a good week meantime and can distract yourself with lovely things.  Spoiling is a great idea for you pre-op too as well as of course afterwards.

Expect it won\u2019t start for a few weeks as there is a bit of a wait in our unit. i will probably post later to say how it goes as deciding on whether or not to have chemo has been a tough call.

I quite agree about what my friend said, it stunned me at the time, but it isn't the first and won't be the last bit of really unhelpful advice one can get from people around you who are not going through the same thing, or have done.  I have to say that is one of the reasons why this is such a great place to talk. I have just heard from the hospital, and as part of the Optima trial, my tumour was one of those tested and I am not being recommended for Chemo - yeahhhh. so relieved.  I find out on Monday what the next step is, radiotherapy I think, and hormone therapy, but not having six months of chemo is just a massive relief, and it has the benefit of moving the trial further forward hopefully. I am allowed to drive when I get to six weeks, and it has only been just over four since the operation, so I just need to be patient for a little longer.  Not as hard as it is for you, I can quite understand why you wish it was all done, it is horrid having it looming for you.  Anything you can do to help at the moment and keep your mind off it? Do keep me posted with how you are and how you get on. Love and hugs Sophie",

It was lovely to be in the North and Holy Island worked its wonders on me.  Had breast clinic today - dressings off but still no driving, and echo cardiogram for chemo, but all so far so good.  I can't imagine the rollercoaster you are on, at least for me it was pretty obvious from the outset, to come to terms with losing your breast isn't necessarily easy. I had a friend who said when I was first diagnosed that if it were her she would just ask to have them 'both whipped off', wow, know that isn't me.  I felt like I was in between a rock and a hard place when I signed the forms.  Too late now, but I am still glad and surprisingly it is ok.  You will be too, but message me if you need to. Keep nibbling if you can.  lots of hugs and love",

I'm beginning to realise that this isn't just about the stitches healing, but about emotions and mind as well.  I feel as if I have been down an enormous rabbit hole and everything is still a little Alice in Wonderlandy in my own head, whilst the rest of the world is still the terrifying fast paced and pressured merry-go-round I fell off a while ago. You will be fine, it will just take some time and the nurses and staff in the breast units tend to be amazing, so you will be so well looked after.  The don't drive for 6 weeks may depend on your surgeon, mine is cautious, and I am quite glad in retrospect as I tried a short journey this week and found I wasn't as confident as usual, and got sore too.  Having the cancer gone is a good feeling and necessary, but it has a cost and be kind to yourself in that too. You take good care of yourself meanwhile, and keep me posted on how you are feeling, now and as time goes on. Love and hugs Sophie",

Which is why we are here.  Advice for what it\u2019s worth. Give the breast unit a call first thing tomorrow morning or even today and leave a message for them to call you back. No harm in chasing up your referral.  Dont feel you\u2019re making a fuss either. This is huge. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimetines it makes no sense at all. I often find when people tell me that I\u2019ll be fine that\u2019s when it makes least sense if all. Because a diagnosis doesn\u2019t feel fine. It feels and it is life changing. Even if at the end of the day the way it changes our lives is not as terrible as our fears.  Sleep. Don\u2019t worry about it. I found I was awake in the early hours and that was it. Do you have a journal of any sort. It can be really useful to have a dedicated place to write down your thoughts and feelings and questions. I have all my appointments in mine too with all my questions for the medics/nurses and the notes I make when at appointments. That way it is all in the one place I need them and I\u2019m less likely to lose the info which is really reassuring as I am not the most organised of people. I also have my to do lists in there and looking back it is surprising how much I got done in those dark hours of the night. Banking, admin, washing and if you need to chat in the night there is an online group for those not sleeping too.  When it comes to food. Also get that. I lost a load of weight during the diagnosis period. Couldn\u2019t eat either. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it but let yourself eat those things you might just want. Oddly my snack was cereal with ice cold milk and cream. Something I haven\u2019t eaten since I was a kid! I\u2019m warning myself off it now as ever since the op - full mastectomy, lymph node clearance and reconstruction my appetite has come back.  Anything else you need or want to chat about just go online. We\u2019ll get back to you and if you can tell anyone in physical life do. It really helps to have people around you.  Hope you get news of your referral soon.  Xx",

Thank you so, so much though, you have really helped and helped me to ask the questions that I couldn't quite get to before. Hugs xxx",

      "Content": "Hi. Hoping this is ok to post. I have just had my post op appointment and I\u2019m in a bit of a muddle emotionally and logically so I hope someone might be able to help.  Operation went well Tumors though sizeable - over 5cm were removed in the mastectomy and only a few of my lymph nodes were positive although I did have full axillary clearance. However they are recommending chemo followed by radio therapy before long term hormone therapy and I am not sure exactly why.  I have no breast on that side apparently this type of cancer - invasive lobular - is unlikely to appear in the other breast and is very resistant to chemo therapy so if the cancer is gone why do I need further treatment. Is there a higher risk of further cancer in the same area or elsewhere or am I now cancer free- which is what the surgeon seemed to say when he told me. In fact it was sort of a session where he told me he had done his job and whilst I still have to return to the clinic to have my dressings changed that\u2019s it I am now not their concern. I see the oncologist on Monday.  I am really confused emotionally as I feel like I should be celebrating but I\u2019m actually rather bewildered and feel a bit lost as I don\u2019t think I\u2019m under the breast cancer care unit any more. Meanwhile the surgery wounds are healing well but the bruising is still huge and very painful and my arm feels as if the skin is in a cheese grater. I am not allowed to drive for another four weeks and can\u2019t go back to work for a while either.   Sorry I sound as if I am feeling sorry for myself but I just wondered if anyone out there had any advice.  Thanks xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Thank you so much again for that, so answers to questions. I am 50, in overall good health although I have arthritis, and migraines, which I control as much as possible. That said in November of last year I was admitted to hospital with secondary sepsis following a UTI which has been reoccurring every 3-5 weeks since - something that does worry me if I have chemo as my white blood count will struggle to cope with any underlying infection. I am also a single mum to an 18yr old son and a 16yr old son with autism - both of whom are doing their exams this summer.  I also work, full time until March, but the company is having to make cut backs so it is part time at the minute.  There is no provision for sick pay, so it is statuary which doesn't go far with sons.  Whilst I am working I will continue to get working tax and child tax credits which will help. Also my job relys on my memory as I am an auctioneer and valuer of fine art and antiques so remembering what things are, and their likely worth is pretty vital to my work and when on the rostrum I need to stay really on the ball to keep the bidding on track, and me on track with it - so working with Chemo and the likely effects on my brain even short term is a difficult thing to see working.  In fact, I suspect if I react badly to the chemo, and have to take substantial time off work it is likely I will lose my job.  It is only a tiny business and they really can't afford to carry passengers. I owe it to my sons to do my best to make sure I stay healthy long term, but staying as an effective mother in the short to medium term seems even more important at the moment. As for decisions I have made, well I have made some huge mistakes in my life, but know I am not perfect, so sort of get on with what is and try and sort things out as best I can.  Life is messy, rather than predictable in my world.  Usually just as you get one thing sorted out - eg clearing up cat or dog sick the cieling starts to crumble on your head in the other corner of the room - not just an analogy, that did actually happen, and I still have the hole in the ceiling to prove it - I will sort that out at some time when I am aloud to lift my arm above my head again. - however I digress. Predict doesn't seem to differentiate for different types of Breast Cancer - eg ductal or lobular, so it can't factor that in, however apparently according to my surgical consultant at the breast clinic ILC is supposedly very resistant to chemo, so that is where I am taking that from, and it was confirmed by my oncologist, so the predict tool percentage is likely to be optomistic in my case.  Also I have been asked to join a blind trial where if I were tested (and there is no way to ask to be tested rather than not as it is a blind trial) the trial information reads that 'Most patients in Group 2 (those tested) wiill not have chemotherapy and can go straight to hormone therapy', suggesting that most patents in the trial in total won't benefit from chemo. Your earlier reply over the weekend was so helpful, but I take Lynn's point too.  Still veering a bit wildly between the two options, so any further insights would be really brilliant.  Thank you so much. Sophie / Pollydog xxx Been feeling knackered from the surgery and not great anyway, but I suspect that that has more to do with anxiety and everything else than being a 'real' thing, just psychosomatic.",

Meanwhile diagnosed with and treated for number of UTIs recurring every 2-4 weeks.  MRI bone scan and Ct done prior to breast surgery as biopsy suggested cancer in lymph nodes. Biopsies done 7th Feb this year.  Surgery end of March this year. Histology results say ILC stage II ER+ with 2 lymph nodes positive.  Really don\u2019t know if I can keep this family running in the short term with chemo effects and in all honesty job is precarious as company struggling so to abandon them now may seal all our fates. Definitely mine and can\u2019t survive financially with the boys if I lose my job. Don\u2019t mind about long term so much as boys will be more independent. Also trial sends most people tested straight to hormone/radio which suggests more info gives negative benefit for chemo. Sorry to agonise publicly but really really appreciate your help.  Why does the UTI make you think chemo better option btw?  Thank you.  Polly Dog hugs as she\u2019s home.  Xxx",

      "Content": "Dear Carolyn  I can\u2019t tell you how much having you take the time and the trouble and the energy to reply so fully means. Thank you. I have spent a good few hours thinking about what you\u2019ve said and I really recognise the \u2018unscientific\u2019 bit. It makes all too familiar sense to me. The science is helpful too.  I think however much I might want to run away from this - I told you I\u2019m not brave- my body has been telling me there is something wrong for a while. I have told the oncologist and asked my go about it but apart from the recurrent UTI there is nothing tangible. Is it something to worry about - maybe not. But is it something to ignore in a decision about treatment ? - definitely not.  Scared as I am then I think I\u2019m going to decide to go for the chemo trial. I will sit with the decision over the weekend and see how it feels. But I\u2019m hoping the agonising over it is over and I can put my energies into rallying the support I may need. Work colleagues to help my addled brain, school and caring support to help the boys, and making sure the budgets as tight as can be etc. Going through chemo might not be easy for this little family but we will find a way. We always do. Thank you Carolyn. Your rambles are never rambles but always really helpful.  You take care.  Hugs Sophie xx",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Thank you for that.  To be honest the best I can do I think is the trial they are offering, as they haven't mentioned the Oncofocus and I have asked about further tests and more targeted therapies based on the tumour itself which really means its not available to me.  I had been coming round to accepting that chemo might be the way to go, based on all the brilliant advice I have had from you and everyone else here on line and talking at home.  Having sat with the decision I have decided to go for the trial and signed the papers this morning, which means I should hear if I am having chemo (most likely) or not - if the tumour is a part of the test group and it is better for me to go straight to hormone therapy.in two weeks time.  If it is chemo then I start on Wednesday 1st May.  Scared, but I think it is the right decision and it was reassuring that the Dr and Nurse said so too, they obviously hadn't been able to say before, but really felt that I should take the trial. I do wish that the medicine was a bit further ahead and more available for everyone to have more targetted therapies, but maybe, this trial will help that move forward. Thank you so much honey for all the support, and help and advice. Have a lovely Easter if I don't post before, I am traiining it and bussing it up to Northumberland as it is one of my favourite places in the world. Love and Hugs Sophie xx",

Discussed it with my GP too as she is really helpful and she feels it\u2019s a really difficult one to weigh. Hey ho. Meanwhile back on antibiotics for uti, this will be my seventh episode since October.  Can\u2019t help thinking that it starting just before I noticed the breast cancer is strangely coincidental as it put me in hospital with secondary Sepsis and until then I was rarely ill with anything and never off work.  Funny how our brains draw parallels in unhelpful ways.  That said. I am lying in my beautiful bedroom with the sunshine outside and a good breeze blowing through. It\u2019s not a bad life and I have my trusty hound back home who is hiding beside me from the cat who enjoys pouncing on her.  Thank you all and I\u2019ll tell you how it goes. Keep posting. It is lovely to be a part of the discussion as well as really helpful to get the advice.  Thanks guys hugs - gentle ones today though xxx",

Taste buds is great news, I can do temporary.  Just love food and cooking so doing permanent would be hard, thank you for sharing that. Really hope your four year check goes well if I don't speak to you before. hugs Sophie xxx",

It is great to hear from other real women out there who have had different but similar experiences. Also like the way you put \u2018only a mastectomy\u2019 in parenthesis. I agree there is nothing only about it. In fact the only thing small about having the operation for me was the size of my original breasts. I am a b/c cup at best. But they were both precious to me and I am grateful to still have one.   Sounds like you have been through it hard too and I would like to hear more.  Xx",

      "Content": "Dear Tina,  Thank you so much. Really really helpful to hear from you as it sounds as if you have had a very similar diagnosis to me and as a mum I can completely see where you are coming from when it comes to being able to know that you have gone everything you can to beat this and be around for your kids.   You also sound as if you felt pretty torn at the start.  I have emailed some questions to the oncology nurse that saw me and suggested I ask her any further questions. So that may help too if I get some answers. I take it that as the Optima is a blind trial you didn\u2019t know if you were recommended chemo because you were in the 50% that weren\u2019t tested or if you had been tested and it was recommended?  Also may I ask if you know if the loss of a sense of taste is temporary. I know I shouldn\u2019t say this but you sound very brave. Thank you for replying to my post. I really really appreciate it. Glad you\u2019re almost at the end. They say the Docetaxel can be tougher. Hope the next round is maybe a bit easier for you.  Thank you so much.  You continue to take care much live and laughter to you all Sophie  xxx",

I signed up to the Optima trial, and I was one of the lucky ones, my tumour was tested and I have been recommended to not have chemo.  I am so relieved and also so want this trial to complete so that it is a standard test for everyone.  I know this means I still have a bit of a road to travel, there is radiotherapy and hormone therapy still to go. Thank you everyone who has helped me on this road so far and with this decision which felt so difficult to make. Please do keep me posted too on how you are all getting on. With love and hugs",
