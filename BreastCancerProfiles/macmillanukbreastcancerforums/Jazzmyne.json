    "Content": "Yesterday I went to the Breast clinic at my local Hospital because i had a lump about the size of an orange which seemed to have come from nowhere and grown fairly fast (may have been there for a while but in the last 12 months I have had many personal and other health issues to deal with) Anyway, whereas I suspected that there was something sinister growing there - having it confirmed was still a blow and im still reeling from the shock of it all! I apparently have an invasive ductal Carcinoma about 4-5 cms that will require a mastectomy and due to health issues the consultant has advised an Axilla node clearance at the same time limiting the occasions of needing a general anaesthetic. Whilst I was having an ultrasound the doctor doing the procedure noticed some abnormalities in the other breast and took a sample of that with Fine Needle - Which I found quite worrying at the time and even though the result came back as clear - I cant help thinking - THIS TIME!! My current thoughts take me places I dont really want to go to including the thought that as soon as one is removed something will grow in the currently \"good\" breast and i would have to go through the same all over again. I also have a family history of Breast Cancer from my late father's side and I cant help wondering if it would not just be easier to have a double Mastectomy and dispel the irrational thoughts. Would this be a possiblity? and if so, would it extend the amount of time I would have to stay in hospital? I have read that some people do elect to have a double and just wondered about the added recovery time if this were to be an option for me. If anyone has the experience with this and could help I would welcome any input! Thank you.",
