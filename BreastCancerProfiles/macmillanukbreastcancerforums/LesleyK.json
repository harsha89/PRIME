    "Content": "Hello, just read the last two posts on here off the main page. I was determined to keep my long hair, but got taken into hospital for 10 days and it was so annoying i had it cut short, and then it was falling everywhere so i shaved it to a no 2. Weirdly it is still falling out but it doesn't look like it? I've got a wig which can be really annoying, and scarves which i like. I wear a hat in the house and fling it off when i have a hot sweat and then put it on again. My ears are cold but it's great having a shower, no hair to mess with! :)",
