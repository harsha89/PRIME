I asked the bcn when when I was in having node clearance and she could not tell me precisely what it is and was asked to wait unit Monday when drain removed from the lymph clearance ( was getting fed up by then) . On returning on the Monday to have drain removed seen another nurse who then asked a Dr to look at it who just said it nothing to be concerned about and would check again on next visit. Since Monday the area above and below scar line has grown more and feels solid underneath, i have tried before massaging bio oil around the area but was told not to put anything on by the Dr on Monday. The only way to really describe it is like the size of half an apple and the scar line being gobbled up in the middle, just wondering if anyone out there has had this problem? Wendy d",

It is awkward carrying round a drain and trying to keep fresh and clean but just do things in the bathroom slowly, and I found the hospital gave you a bag to put the drain bottle in at home so it's easy to carry around ( I then put it on a belt around my waist so you did not have to carry it) it's amazing how you adapt when you have to.
