    "Content": "Hi just logged on and noticed this post.......I too was told I had a clot but mine was found in the aorta whilst having a scan for the cancer,there were no symptoms at all with mine so in  a way you were fortunate.   I agree that this clot was more frightening in terms of sudden death than the cancer was.     I have since been told that now my treatment has finished i could come off the injections but it has been replaced with warfarin which i believe I have to continue taking for life as once you have had a blood clot you are still prone to get them althoiugh this may not be the case for you,so good luck    Colette",
