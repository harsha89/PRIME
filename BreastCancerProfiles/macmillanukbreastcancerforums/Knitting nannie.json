After having my lump removed and being told it was non agressive and not spread the hope was just to have radiotherapy, when my test came back saying chemo was recommended I was devastated. For a couple of reasons.(I don t mind expanding on this)  But I m doing well and at least with the test I know I'm doing this for good reason other than because that's what we do ! Please ask anything and if I can help I will  xx",
