    "Content": "Hi Sugartc I am having exactly the same but on the 9th March and am having exactly the same thoughts.  I have ordered bras from M & S and Amazon.  My BCN recommended Primark for the firm control pants but am a bit worried as they all seem a bit nylon(y).  As you say control knickers are not easy at the best of times.  I have been really positive up until now but all getting a bit scary now..   Let me know if you come up with any solutions.",
