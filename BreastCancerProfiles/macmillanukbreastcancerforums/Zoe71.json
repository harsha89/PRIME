      "Content": "Hi thanks for replying, think I am going to bite the bullet and speak to my mum, although painful I think as a 20 year survivor she will be positive no matter what the outcome. Just trying to find the right words. Think I will phone the helpline though definitely need to get a few things clear in my head before the appointment. Thanks for the support Zoe xxx",

      "Content": "I have found two lumps below my collarbone slightly above my breast, they have been there since Xmas but due to other factors ( a failed vasectomy and subsequent miscarriage) I somehow managed to ignore them until last week. The doc has referred me urgently to the breast clinic, I also have raised lymph node in my armpit and groin area which have not reduced despite antibiotics. I feel so alone, have only told Hubby I really want to tell my mum and ask her to attend clinic with me but scared of upsetting her and bringing back memories of her own BC. Hope to get the courage to speak to her tonight, hoped that yesterday though! Any advice on how to get through the next few days/ weeks greatly appreciated xxx",

      "Content": "Hi employers are not able to discriminate due to illness or disability. In large employers such as local authorities such details are not usually disclosed to the interview panel. I work for social services and we had a team member who on appointment was amazed that her MS condition had not been disclosed although she had made it clear on her application form. She hastily met with our manager to avoid future problems but I would say definitely go for it. Good luck xxx",
