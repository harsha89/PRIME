      "Content": "Hi Sorry you have this worry, it is indeed all you need. Far from being a health risk it may well reduce the number of mammos you need to have. Welcome progress if the study is a success. I was also recalled from screening and because of the uncertainty of what they were dealing with between mammos, repeat, magnified, guided biopsy and check I counted seven in one day. I have had my surgery and reconstruction and apart from wobbling a bit this week am none the worse for my ordeal. On that score I have had some great advice on here for which I will be eternally grateful. Wishing you well for your appointment",

I took in a notebook and pen to record my feelings, thankful that I did as I'd been told my post op stay would be two to three days and it ended up being seven. My hospital preferred the drains to be under 40mls before allowing you home but removed them after seven days regardless to avoid infection, this was fine by me. Between my dog and young grandchildren I would have been terrified of it being pulled out. I never did get to listen to my ipod or read my book as there was plenty of conversations going on in the ward. Visitors/staff ate my sweets. Wishing you all the best, hope you are as pleased with your reconstruction as I was.",

You have some really good suggestions here already and I'm not half as good with words as you are but would like to say thank you and that something for the children would be a wonderful legacy for Annabel. Could be anything from a new toy to a holiday. Is it possible that Annabel's Angels could grow big enough to provide a caravan or two. Just a thought........... Another thing I didn't see in previous posts, apologies if I missed it, access to a specially trained fitness instructor who is aware of what is and isn't good for us along this rocky road. I was lucky enough to have a pretty cotton drain bag, mini under arm pillow, sports bra and bra top provided for me. Ah, there is another expense, suppose the list is endless.......... front fastening pj's for post surgery - maybe a merchandising oportunity here? Think my mind is going to run away with me so best stop here. Well done to all Annabel's Angels. Huge comforting hugs for everyone",

I know those close to me are checking more and looking forward to their first routine screening. Yesterday I had an appointment in another town. Having a couple of special events coming up, I thought that I would have a browse around the shops on my own. Ah bliss! Having to settle on the next best thing on one gift, I found myself saying \"it's ok, this will be fine, perhaps even better\" Now this is something the old me (or is that just pc me) would never have done but I found myself going on to explain why. This genuinely lovely lady went on to ask loads of questions, which I was happy to answer. She said it really made her think. Having said how good I look, and discussing my skin care regime as she couldn't believe how old I was, I just know that she will recount this tale to her family and friends and most likely them to theirs and so the awareness is spread from real life experience. Biggest of hugs and best wishes to all of you still fighting your battle. For me, today is one year on from my first positive biopsy result. I've stepped off that rollercoaster and sitting on the swings. I know I've still got a few hurdles ahead but hopefully I'll clear them too. Jules x",

Sorry I was the worlds worst person for asking questions, went through it all with blinkers on. That said, it is underneath so I'm not aware of it unless I have a check.  Good luck with your decision and have a wonderful holiday.    ",

I ran this past my BCN who spoke with the Consultant - his advice was to use simple moisturiser and take antihistimines. I was already doing this as it was driving me mad.

I would try not to worry too much about genetic testing for the time being. From my understanding it would be your girls who would be tested to establish if they carried the gene(s). I felt that we were being discouraged when I questioned the occurances in our family with my BCN, I am the 6th, so naturally my daughter, sister and her daughters were concerned. Your comment about the testing for women in Scotland was interesting, now I get why they say DCIS is not cancer.

I had a mastectomy and reconstruction in October and still have a little bit of my scar to heal. I had an allergic reaction to the paper stitching rather than an infection. My Consultant decided to leave the wound uncovered rather than replace the dressing, a bit of a nuisance at times but I'm sure helped in the long run. I also took care with moisturiser, getting as close to but avoiding the actual scar.",

My breast care nurse had directed me to Amoena's sports bra to start wearing six weeks post surgery. Later on, I started going to the gym and couldn't find a suitable sports bra, most were racer back and I found them very difficult to get into, so head for a trusted comfortble one. None of my previous everyday bras were suitable, and I lost count of the number I tried, only to be disappointed in one way or another. I ordered a couple of different styles from Amoena to try and opted for the fit and comfort of Angelina. I would recommend this to anyone regardless of reconstruction or not, much better a bra with pockets that you feel good in than one without that leaves you feeling vulnerable. Would a rose by any other name smell so sweet.........of course it would",

I couldn't understand why I was so tearful when in my head I thought I should be happy that my only treatment was Mx.  You may already have seen the link to an article by Dr Peter Harvey that Little My gave to me, I know there are others on the site who have also been thankful for it.  Incase not here it is again www.cancercouselling.org.uk/northsouth/extra4.nsf/.../article3.pdf I was fortunate to have immediate reconstruction and for the most part I guess I'm happy with that, however there are days where I beat myself up about the difference in size and no amount of reassurance from anyone will convince me otherwise.  I have found that I feel this is less noticeable with a strappy bra top from www.amoena.co.uk.  I was introduced to them by my breast care nurse when I asked what to wear post surgery.  I now have a few colours and have used them dressed up to go on nights out or down with jeans, they are so comfortable. You and your partner have a lot to deal with and I'm sure he didn't mean to upset you.  I had a conversation with a friend who's husband has cancer, she told me that it is difficult for the partner to know what to say or do. Is lypo filling an option for WLE?  I'm not sure,,,, maybe others can help.  I know that there was a girl having this done when I was in hospital but didn't get to ask why. Once I was able to drive I took myself shopping and bought a dress with a lot going on up top which I felt boosted my confidence.  I wore this to a party at New Year and I can honestly say that those who didn't know porobably didn't guess.

Love your JUST, I remember saying that if I just have a simple strattice recon at the same time as mx it will be one scar and one short recovery time. Then ....... panic when Breast Surgeon said he would do it all. I was reassured by my Breast Care Nurse that this was quite normal. BS was able to give me a date for surgery at that appointment without the need to liaise with the Plastics Team. He told me that I could always come back for a better match, however I'm only a B cup and although undressed I think they look odd, they're actually not bad once I'm in a bra. I've not shared this, for fear of blowing my cover but I was operated on in the hospital I work in. Sitting up in bed post surgery the Plastics guys all did a double take, seeing my Consultants initials they quickly realised why I was there. When I told them what procedure I'd had and that Mr B had done my reconstruction, there were nothing but favourable comments. One even said that's good it's all done and dusted. I had kind of felt guilty that they may have thought why hadn't I asked for one of them, but I needn't have worried. Hopefully throughout today there'll be lots more with the same procedure as you to help you make your decision for tomorrow. I guess in short I'm saying that in my experience the Plastic Surgeons had every confidence in the Breast Surgeons. All the best with your surgery and recovery whatever you decide. ladybird51 hope all goes well for you tomorrow. Virtual hand holding and hugs",

Yes, I had a strattice reconstruction, hence my title, sorry have to find some humour in it. I'm known to refer to my mismatched pair as pinky and perky. Since I'm small busted the size difference isn't so noticeable, it's more like one wobbles and one doesn't. It is still early days for you with lots more internal healing to do. It certainly does settle down, in terms of being hard although I find mine can change from day to day, I'm sure this is weather related though. Best check with your Consultant or BCN but I shouldn't think it will droop any further after six weeks, at least I don't think mine did. I'm sure they sit it at a position which looks alien undressed so that when in a bra they appear to be in the same position. On the whole I'm happy with my choice. Hope you have a good day",

I've had a few friends and relatives holiday there and only ever heard good reports about it. Sadly, with a son living overseas our holiday of choice always draws us close to him, so might never get to see it. I know it's bad and I tell everyone else not to do it but I did google to check on expansion of silicone implants in flight and while some said they didn't others were scary. My son reminded me of all the jet set celebs who have reportedly had augmentation. Of course any problem they had would be all over the press. Too late to get in a flap now, flights are booked and I'm so looking forward to seeing everyone. Hope you have a good day.",

My BCN had told me about the site and I had had a look but it wasn't until four months down the line when the tears I thought I should have had durirng the time of diagnosis and treatment started to flow. You find out here that it is perfectly normal to stay positive and focus on what is happening at the time, wobbles come when most unexpected. I can empathise with the guilty feelings, I used to think I was mad to feel wobbly when I should be grateful that the removal of 'booby' was the end of my journey. Even almost a year on it all seems a bit surreal, I kept a journal at the time, even so I never quite lost the feeling that I was talking about someone else. I wish you well on this roallercoaster.

I had no external stitching but not sure if that applies to everyone. My consultant told me that it was one of the internal disolving stitches. although goodness knows how they manage to work themselves through like they do. He said it was nothing to worry about although I thought it would never go away, like how was it going to disolve if it was on the outside. it took a good six months before I was no longer aware of it. Also if your seroma is really uncomfortable ask your team if you can have it drained. I had to have this done a few times but the relief was immense. Wish you well on the rocky road ahead.  ",
