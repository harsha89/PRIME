      "Content": "Hiya, Just wanted to say the treatment is harsh but is working for me, I have or had an overall tumour size of 7 mm by 40 mm it's shrank down on Fec to 10 mm. Just had my 2nd lot of T yesterday so I'm near the end of chemotherapy, only 1 more to go. I also have spread to lymph nodes. Surgery is my next stop, although they haven't quite decided if it's mastectomy or lumpectomy then radiotherapy. It's gonna be a rough ride but macmillon sight is great as there are wonderful people here sharing their experiences an offering there advice. Take care and good luck.",

      "Content": "Don't know how to start, but just got back from mammogram, ultrasound and my 4th biopsy after having finished Chemotherapy. They decided to biopsy some lumps that developed and feel like just under the skin, that are getting bigger and also more of them, it started off as one now there are about 5 of these lumps just below the armpit now. They first appeared after 2nd lot of Docetaxol and I mentioned them to the oncologist at the time, who thought they were more like boils / blocked pore but that's over 9 weeks ago and they are still there and growing not only in size but in numbers. Trying so  hard to keep it all together, today is a very bad day, I've been so tearful and I know should stop Googling but can't help it and I still have surgery and radiotherapy to go !!!!",

      "Content": "Hi, PICC line has been causing me some problems, itching and what looks like an oozing of yellow stuff. The nurse who came to clean it said its possible due to irritation from the plaster and just to try and not scratch. I mentioned the redness (which was not as bad then) and itching to the Onc on Wednesday and he prescribed antibiotics just in case, I am thinking of starting to take this just in case its getting infected. Has anyone had any similar problems? Any advice would be very welcomed. Thank you",
