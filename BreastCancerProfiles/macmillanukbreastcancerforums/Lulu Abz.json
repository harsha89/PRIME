    "Content": "Hi Sweetcheeks, I remember this well! I thought I would never lift my arm above my head again! Consultant and breast nurse advised getting someone to massage the cording - gently but firmly, putting pressure on the \"band\" and holding it for a few seconds at a time. Yes it hurts but it does help reduce the pain and cleared it up eventually. Use bio oil or E 45 for massaging the area in and around the arm pit and down the arm.Â I found laying down with arm supported on a pillow worked best. Nurse also said i should be twice daily massaging the scar tissue firmly as well, it has reduced the kaeloid scaring. Good luck, stick with it and yes keep doing the excercises! I found the Breast Cancer Care exercise DVD really useful.",
