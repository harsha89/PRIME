    "Content": "Hi Folks, Was diagnosed back in 2006 and underwent mastectomy with immediate recon.  Due to radiotherapy, I developed a distortion and so have recently undergone the back-flap recon as an alternative. It;s been about 5 weeks now and seems to be settling down okay apart from continuous lower back pain.  Had chronic back spasm about 2 weeks ago which was alot more painful than the mastectomy and which put me back in hospital for a few days.  On meds at the mo, but still suffering lower back pain, especially in the moring, or if I ben too much.  It's been very debilitating.  Has anybody else had similar problems, and if so, what do you receommend?",
