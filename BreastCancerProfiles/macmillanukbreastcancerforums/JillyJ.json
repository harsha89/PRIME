    "Content": "Really sorry to hear this, yes, utterly unfair, horrid BUT - on my 4th FEC I can back up what's been said before. It definitely does get better by the end of the first week! The things that really help me are drinking loads of water and getting fresh air and exercise. I've found that as soon as I can get myself out of the house and go for a walk, usually by the 2nd/3rd day even if not very far, my head starts to clear and I feel less sick and less \"down\". I try to go for a walk every day.. I'm sure everyone's response and energy levels are different, but by the end if the first week after chemo I can generally walk for about an hour or more and feel well on the way to being \"normal\"..... Since having treatment, as recommended on this site and elsewhere i've kept a diary - a few notes on each day - to show what I've done and how I felt. I find this really useful as I can look back and see what I can expect at different stages of the cycle. It's also comforting to look back at when you've just started a cycle, as it gives you hope when you're feeling at your worst! I even put the cycle and day number next to each date so I can compare them - eg 2/14 ( yes, I do see how unbelievably boring that sounds!) I plan stuff for weeks 2 & 3, but expect very little from myself in the first week. In t hat first week I avoid seeing anyone outside immediate family or very close and understanding friends! I discovered that some friends, however lovely, just take more energy to see, so I avoid them until week 2. You've probably seen the Breast Cancer Care site - There's some useful tips there, http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/community/forums/top-tips-help-get-you-through-chemotherapy plus, I think, a, group for young women. Hope there's something here that helps All the very best",
