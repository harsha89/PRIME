      "Content": "Hi Tessa. I have just had my 5th session of chemo today and i havent driven to any of mine, not because i cant but i just dont want to risk it. Also my mum comes to all my sessions with me so i take her shopping in the week and then she takes me to have my chemo. Nice little arrangement, also it's nice to have someone there with you when you are having your chemo. If somebody can take you, then let them dont over do it, it's not worth it. Good Luck with your chemo love Shady x",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy, After my 2 operations for breast cancer my breast was very red and i felt unwell. I went to the hospital and i had an infection which i had previously on the first operation due to the biopsy that they had done. They put me on antibiotics but it still took about 3 weeks to clear up. This of course delayed my chemo but it was out of my hands so i just had to sit and wait for that date to arrive. Well the 25th April arrived ( chemo day ) and i was really nervous, but it was not as bad as i thought. Felt very sick on that evening and woke up the morning to actually be sick. After that i felt fine. The anti sickness pills they give you are very good. Like susan above i am just ticking off the chemo sessions as they pass, 5 more to go and can't wait. Everybody is worried about starting chemo but we all react different to the drugs and i hope that you sail through yours. Good luck for Thursday, and keep us posted. Love Shady x",
