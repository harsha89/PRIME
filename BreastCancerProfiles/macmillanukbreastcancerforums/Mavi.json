I'm sick of sitting around already and my treatment hasn't even started.  x",

Yes, I feel as if I keep the door closed it won't get worse!  Mad I know.  I'm fine messaging people but when somebody calls me, I'm off.  It's almost like I'm embarrassed I've got cancer.  It's such a horrible word. How did your first chemo go?  Are you trying the ice cap thing?  That's another thing that's freaking me.  I've got short hair but the thought of losing it isn't great.  How many sessions/weeks is your chemo lasting for?  That's why I'm getting the chemo too so the surgery should be less intrusive and the tumour smaller.  I was trying to soak in all the information but some has seeped back out!  I shall be more attentive tomorrow and take a notebook.  I actually had the notebook with me but just stared at it and the the surgeon wrote down the type of cancer I have as I must have been staring at him vacantly!

For some reason, if I run on the treadmill, I think I can run it out of me.  Silly, but it seems to help.  Headphones on and try not to think of anything.  Obviously, once my treatment starts, that will be out of the window but at the moment, it's getting me through it.  Keep positive, stay focused.  We can do this.  Dot xx",

At that point, I didn't know whether this was the cold cap, or the chemo!  I had my second round of chemo on Tuesday and made the decison not to use the cold cap as my hair is falling out anyway.  I have had no headaches,  not queasy and not dizzy.

Everybody is different though.  There was a man sitting next to me on Tuesday who didn't seem to be bothering too much at all about it. My hair is almost gone, just like a newborn now!  I can't quite get the courage to shave it off but I am putting my wig on today for the first time.  I actually really like the wig but I think it's just that initial step of walking out the door with it on that's getting at me!

Suffered from a seroma at the site of the lymph node removal and had to be drained twice.  Felt like I had a tennis ball under my arm!  Port also removed - yay!  Arm still doesn't feel right and now 3 weeks after surgery.  Numb feeling and can't quite straighten.  Been up at hospital today to get \"measured\" for Radiotheraphy and tattoos now in place.  Start on 2 August for 20 sessions altogether. Weird, oncologist advises that she is really pleased with my results.  Tumour gone completely but can't quite get that feeling of joy I thought I would have.  Still cancer cells in my body.  Obviously now to be targeted by 20 sessions of RT.  They've said it's in remission but I wanted to hear \"that's you cancer clear\".  I am sure there will always be a niggle at the back of my mind - will it come back - but I will remain positive. Still on Herceptin until Feb 2019 and now also being prescribed Zometa for 3 years.  I will get this every 6 months.  It's to stop osteoporosis  as the RT breaks down the cell structure.  Also to get prescription for calcium.  Still, getting there.  Hoping that I get that \"all clear\" later on in the year.  To be honest, my journey with cancer has flown by.  When I was diagnosed in December 2017, I thought it would drag. I suppose having so many appointments, things to try and remember to add to your diary, cures for side effects, it's been pretty hectic. I am still off work.  Managed to work through FEC but finished at the start of April.  Not quite sure when I will go back.  Certainly not until after the Herceptin has finished in Feb.  I want sometime for \"ME\" once all the medication stops.  I want to be free to do what I want to do and not go to the chemist, go the hospital, inject myself to stop blood clotting etc, etc.  Might even get myself on that Indian Head Massage course I've been looking to do and try my hand at some silver jewellery making.  A new me will emerge :) For those starting their journey, good luck and for those coming to the end, I hope it's not been too bad for you either.

      "Content": "Hi all, not updated for a while due to complications but nothing to do with chemo! Finished my 3 x FEC.  Ended up with terrible diarrhoea which I thought was a side effect.  Sample handed into doc and advised I have had food poisoning.  Either ecoli or Salmonella.  Another sample gone in last week to check the position.  Wonderful!  One weekend feeling great, go out with friends and then end up sicker than chemo side effects.  Spent a week on the settee and ended up getting a blood clot in my leg.  Honestly, could write a book!  I have had a clot before and have a condition called Protein S Deficiency which means my blood can be prone to clotting even though I am injecting myself with blood thinner daily.  Ended up at the Western last Saturday for 4 1/2 hours with some really unwell people sitting around me which didn't help.  Back on Sunday to get ultrasound and confirmed clot in the back of my calf.  Now upped my daily injection levels to help dissolve the clot. Have now started my new cycle of Perjeta, Herceptin and Paclitaxel.    So I get the Paclitaxel weekly and the Perjeta (only 3 of these in total) with Herceptin every third week.  I believe Herceptin will be for a year in total.  I may get my port removed after the Perjeta and Paclitaxel are finished.  The Herceptin can be given as an injection in the leg so I will do a trial round of one and then decide whether I will get my port removed and continue with leg injections for the remaining period. Good news is the Oncologist has agreed I can go on holiday at the end of May.  I am over-excited to say the least.  Spent the last two days getting quotes for travel insurance which has been interesting.  First quote was £800 for a 2 week holiday in Greece!!  Some won't even insure if awaiting any kind of surgery.  Even though I am getting my lumpectomy in July.  Quite bizarre. Managed to get one for £88 which is double the price we paid for a yearly world-wide policy before I was diagnosed but worth it to get away. Choked with the cold yesterday but on the mend today.  Keep strong all. Mavi (Dot) xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn, that's weird isn't it?  Yes, the first time I found out I got the clot sitting on one of these little deck chairs with the metal bar across the front - 9 years ago.  They tested my blood and found the Protein S.  Put me on Warfarin for 6 months but luckily took me back off.  Got my sexy socks to wear on flights but have a slightly allergy to nylon so they do make my legs itch.  Definitely considering the removal for the Herceptin.  I think I will still have to heard to the chemo unit for my Herceptin as it appears to take 15 minutes for the injection.  I shall ask some questions when I am nearing the end of my other treatment and see what is best. Thank you! Dot xx",

      "Content": "Hi LiziX I just started my Perjeta, Paclitaxel and Herceptin last week and ok so far.  My Paclitaxel is weekly and I had another one yesterday.  I get the Perjeta and Herceptin every 3rd week.  I've already come through 3 x FEC so hoping this one goes ok too.  I was given anti sickness, steriod and Piritin before the Paclitaxel yesterday but didn't need to take any more anti sickness.  Been feeling fine.  I believe, for my treatment, it just a case of keeping my drugs up to the same level at all times so hoping I won't feel any different.  I've been for a Reiki treatment this morning as I'm awake around 1330 with the steriods.  Only last for 3 days but getting it weekly will make this tiring.  I plan to nap when my body needs it but carry on with life as usual.  I hope to get to the gym to a gentle stretch class on Friday.  Not usually my scene as I like to feel like I've done something but at least it will be change of scenery!  If it's too easy, I'll try and have a cycle. Try and do what you normally do with loads of fresh air thrown in to help!  Take care and will be thinking of you. Difficult to say try not to worry too much.  Take each day as it comes and make the most of the good days Mavi (Dot xx)",
