    "Content": "Hi all, I was in the UK a few months ago to do a benefit for Macmillan. It was a performance of my one-woman musical show about my experiences with the BRCA mutation (which spikes breast cancer risk to 87%). Here's a review of that show from Macmillan staff: http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Fundraising/Inyourarea/England/Greater_London/Local_news/TheMutantDiariesUnzippingMyGenes.aspx  I was happy to be able to help Macmillan but I know a lot of women who wanted to attend were not able to. Now, I'm happy to inform you that I will be releasing a DVD version of the show soon and will donate part of the proceeds to hereditary cancer research and support. You can pre-order a copy of the DVD here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evamoon/the-mutant-diaries-unzipping-my-genes-dvd I'm encouraging pre-orders because that is how I will raise the funds to be able to produce the DVD. The pre-order period ends December 19th, 2013.  I hope you will consider pre-ordering one for yourself or for a friend going through a rough patch - or even as a gift to your Macmillan chapter's resource library. Thank you! Eva Moon More about the show: http://mutantdiaries.com",
