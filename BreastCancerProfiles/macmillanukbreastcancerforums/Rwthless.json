      "Content": "I felt remotely disappointed that I wasn't likely to lose my hair. Odd that, because I always thought of it as my crowning glory. It was going grey at the roots, and was really a horrible pepper and salt colour. I thought a short new growth might be quite fetching. On the other hand, because of this hernia, I have a lump on the side of my tummy at elbow level. I have just started to make a Lapis Lazuli dress to match my new gold coloured handbag. I am going to a Golden wedding celebration and not wanting to compete with the Golden Bride, am wearing dark blue. As mothers of Bride and Groom, we are totally different colour and style types, and have never been known to duplicate in nearly 20 years. I just hope that the hernia isn't too obvious. I might make a wrap to disguise the bump, because I bought much too much fabric. I tell myself that nobody will be very interested in my shape at my advanced years, except those who also have had or have Cancer. In any case, it is Pat and Alan's day, and I will just be glad to help them celebrate. We have always been on good terms with them - slightly better than our children have in fact, and that's a blessing. I just don't want to be conspicuous.",

      "Content": "It's something they fob you off with in case it works. Maybe the Lanzoprazole would work. Before I had cancer, I had a lot of acid and eventually, I was put on to Cimetitdine. which has a commercial name I never could remember. Another drug that does much the same is Zantac, and that works quite well. I went to Slimming World, and at the same time, cut out butter and all substitutes. Within a week, I could stop taking the Cimetidine, and apart from once or twice, I haven't had acid since, If I wake in the night with a bit of acid, I drink a full glass of water, and that usually improves it enough to get back to sleep. I then avoid fats for a day or two and I'm as good as new. I do have butter, but not so much, because I lke the taste and don't want to be ill. I hope this helps Rwth",

      "Content": "It's never too late to mention side effects. You didn't mention it last time because a) you hardly noticed it, and b) you thought it might go away in a couple of days, but now it hasn't gone away and it's a nuisance. Tell it out, asap. You could ask your local pharmacist, but tell him/her what chemo you are on, because it could be just a cyst and unrelated to your cancer. If the pharmacist doesn't know, phone the Cancer centre and ask for advice. Hope this helps. Rwth",

      "Content": "It is so frightening, that when I met my oncologist I took a small voice recorder into the meeting with me. I saw the registrar first, and the recording wasn't needed in the end, but it was confidence inspiring to have it. My husband came with me to listen and discuss afterwards, so a close friend with the ability to follow what is said without hostile attitude is useful. My oncologist barks a lot, and slammed a lot of doors until they put a vacuum closer on his office door. He hates cancer and is so kind and patient with all kinds of silly questions. It turns out that there are no silly questions and each patient has a ration of approximately 100 silly questions before the doctors get irritated. Not that I know anything about breast cancer, but if it were me, I'd ask if I could have any radiotherapy needed before the mastectomy (and reconstruction). Then listen to the answer. Have you got a Macmillan nurse? or a nurse consultant at the Cancer Centre you can ask? As for finding someone to love, just don't look. They are like buses, and only come in convoys every few years. Relax and it will happen. Follow your hobbies and interests, and take up dancing if you don't already do it. Even if Ballroom isn't your thing, there's always line dancing, salsa and folk dancing, always worth trying once. Or there's sailing. Lots of clubs inland, as well as coastal. Then when you are enjoying yourself thoroughly, people will be attracted to you, and you will be beating them off! Hope this helps Rwth",

      "Content": "A written complaint addressed to the Hospital (Trust) Board should do the trick. They will have to investigate and send your parents an apology. If the letter says he wants a promise that faults in the system will be attended to, then they will have to do it. After the Bristol Heart scandal, eventually they had to have peer testing of consultants and this is widespread throughout the NHS. They could bring the consultants' testing forward, or have double checking, or the Airline check process, or further training in reading of scans and X rays - apparently overdue. I asked if my chest X-ray, taken before my op was clear of congestion, (My mother died of pulmonary fibrosis) they said I had a slightly enlarged heart. My GP sent me for an ECG, which looks OK to me, but what do I know? I do think that there is no point having these whizzbang new machines if they don't know how to read the results. I am lucky being a stone's throw from a University Hospital with lots of gizmos, including an xray machine that shows EVERYTHING. One test I had was hopelessly mismanaged but fortunately showed there was something to see. The doctor faxed my GP, whose colleague immediately faxed a request to a surgeon. So I didn't complain. I should complain about the XRay, because they never bothered to tell me the result. It was OK for anaesthesia, but it wasn't perfect. Among the procedures needing attention, they should tell radiologists to hold their breath while making the exposures. It might remind them to tell the patient they can breathe again.",
