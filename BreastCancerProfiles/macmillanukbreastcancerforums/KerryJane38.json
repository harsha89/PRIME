      "Content": "Hi. Just wondered if anyone has stopped chemo because of side effects? I have had 2 FEC so far but was due to have 1 more FEC before 3 Docetaxol. I became very low and depressed after the first so GP took me off Citalopram and put me onto Prozac instead. I went into the second round very positively and hoped there would be no further issues. Instead it was even worse and I became so low that my husband was so worried he took me back to GP who advised that if I became any lower I might need to be admitted to a mental health unit for inpatient treatment.  Having done some research I have discovered possible drug interactions which may have caused this. My oncologist was aware of all drugs that I was taking so my confidence has been well and truly knocked. As a result I am seriously considering stopping chemo and asking to have the radiotherapy and tamoxifen now. My history is a lumpectomy to remove a 30mm grade 2 tumour with the sentinel lymph node positive. It was oestrogen positive. My treatment is adjuvant. I am due to meet a new oncologist on Monday to discuss options and realise that the decision is ultimately mine to make but I would welcome any feedback or shared experiences that any of you might have. Thanks in advance. Kerry",
