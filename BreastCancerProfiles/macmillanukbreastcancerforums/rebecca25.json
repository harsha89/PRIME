      "Content": "Thankyou beejay. I have to be strong its the only way to be around my children. Dont worry too much about your mastectomy it isn't all that bad the way i look at it is if my breast has gone most of the cancer has gone and i would be quite happy for them to take the other as well. Sending you all the luck in the world for your mastectomy ",
