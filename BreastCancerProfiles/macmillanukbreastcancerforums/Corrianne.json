      "Content": "Oh Tracy... I feel for you! Finding new lumps is distressing enough, as is the loss of someone close to you. Together they pack a punch. It might be worth looking into some bereavement counselling. While the practical side of dealing with your mom's death is important, right now, you are priority. Take as much time for yourself as you can. One of the first symptoms (aside from the tumour itself) that I had with my cancer is sheer exhaustion. Your body is fighting an immense battle. Remember too that stress is exhausting. Take care of You!",

      "Content": "This is why I said that the path I followed is not for everyone. If there's no money in it, which there isn't for the herbal remedies, they won't research it. They struggle to do proper double-blind studies on many of the claimed cancer 'helpers' (I use that word here in place of 'cures' deliberately. I truly believe that there is so much we don't know, so why scrap something that people have proven first hand works for them just because a big organisation says it's not valid? I know I'm not alone in my experience. I personally have spoken to others who have followed a similar protocol to my own with excellent results. I didn't go into it blindly and my results spoke for themselves. I have the tests and documentation by my medical team to support what I'm saying. I still say... there's room at the table for all. It just takes a little common sense not to dash after the first snake oil ad you see. Just because there's 'no proof' doesn't mean it doesn't work :)",

      "Content": "While there are many sites that say there are miracle cures out there, giving false hope, this kind of post, sadly does exactly that, but at the opposite extreme. When will we, as humans, stop throwing the baby out with the bathwater? There is room for both allopathic (what you'd call pharmaceutical) remedies And natural. After diagnosis of Stage 3 breast cancer, my tumour was a 6 x 4cm monolith consuming my life in so many ways. My lymph node was the size of a hen's egg and clearly visible when I raised my arm. I refused treatment at first, as I believe in the natural way that is being scorned here. Lemon was an important part of that, though not as a miracle cure. It's part of alkalising the body, which is the road to health. I also cut out sugar and many other acidic things I was eating that were so bad for me without taking cancer into consideration. I must point out here that I didn't only take lemon. I was on a huge and complex anti-cancer protocol that was well researched and finely controled. In One month, my tumour had shrunk by 2cm and no further cancer could be found in that lymph gland. It had gone down completely. I then agreed to go on Tamoxifen to keep Pharma and my breast surgeon happy. I have still not had radiation or chemo. I have, however, had my mastectomy. This was because, shortly after my radical reduction in tumour size, my husband died very suddenly and I lost the plot completely, giving up on all that I was doing at the time. This route is not for everyone. It's just something I believe in very strongly and was right for me. I avoid all chemical products and rarely even take an OTC painkiller. It's just who I am. My point here is, there's room for these treatments. Those websites promising miracles are wrong in those promises, but not wrong in the fact that the lemon does help.",
