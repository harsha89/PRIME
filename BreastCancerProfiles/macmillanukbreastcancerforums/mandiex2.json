      "Content": "sorry to hear your news..i know its scary stuff but your not alone. i had a bi-lateral mastectomy a year ago ..tumour only in right side but as i have a strong family history i opted to have both breasts removed. yes the scars are big but they look better all the time.yes my breast arnt the same as before but hey the tumours gone and whilst i know that how they look after is soooo important its not everything. i thought i wasnt bothered how they looked as long as it was gone but it does matter and you really can get a decent looking breast afterwards!! i was 39 at the time of diagnosis and considered young! please take your time in returning to work and depending on any further treatments take it one day at a time ...i still suffer fatige due to chemo and 4 opps but it really is surprising how well your body heals i wish you all the very best for your opp and hope to hear from you again... send me a PM anytime love mandie 100% positive but keeping it real!!!!",
