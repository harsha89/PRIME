      "Content": "I didn't bother with a wig - I knew before chemo began that I didn't want one. Hot and itchy, as you say, and they really don't suit me. So I'm being happily bald and enjoying a wide choice of hats - which actually do suit me, insofar as anything does. Finding attractive cancer hats can be a bit of a battle, there's a lot of butt-ugly turbans out there, but there are better options too. Congratulations on reaching the halfway mark! - Hilary",
