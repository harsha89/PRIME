    "Content": "I hope nobody minds me joining this group and asking this question but its playing on my mind tonight.  My next chemo will be no5 (of 6) yet I've only met my oncologist once (prior to treatment) and each time I've seen a different one of her colleagues.  How is it decided who the oncologist sees and who is passed to their registrars?  It's beginning to really get to me - I will ask but I'm not there till next week.",
