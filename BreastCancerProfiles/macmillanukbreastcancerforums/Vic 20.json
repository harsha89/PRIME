    "Content": "Hi Alison, I was diagnosed a few years ago now but I thought perhaps hearing about my experience might help you. My whole journey through diagnosis, treatment and recovery was shrouded in the most acute feelings of guilt I've ever known. I was 27 and 6 months pregnant, with a 20 month old baby when I was diagnosed. It was also a shock to me. It was fairly advanced so I had to have a mastectomy at 30 weeks pregnant, then my baby induced early to begin chemo (8 cycles) followed by radiotherapy. I had a terrible time with the treatments due to being depleted from the pregnancy anyway and spent a lot of time in hospital and in bed at home. It was horrific not being able to look after my babies. Luckily I have a small but loving family and they were fantastic, just automatically stepping into my shoes. But it broke my heart. I felt guilty to my babies for neglecting them, I felt guilty to my husband for heaping all this worry onto his shoulders, I felt guilty to my parents that they were having to reprise their parenting skills again (and 2 small ones was a shock to them as I'm an only child!!). In my experience, everyone feels guilty after a cancer diagnosis, and I believe it is because it changes everything and upsets people, even if only for a short while, and nobody like being the cause of upset. Everyone is terrified of the word cancer, and it makes you feel guilty that you're the reason they're having to face it as a reality. What I can tell you from a lot further down the road is that you WILL adjust. What you are feeling is normal, and once you stop beating yourself up about feeling upset about a massive shock you will feel calmer and gain some perspective. It is ok to be upset, it is ok to be terrified, it is ok to be angry and you must not feel bad for feeling these things because you see/hear of people 'being brave and always smiling'  through it. It's twaddle. My family would have said the same about me if somebody had asked, even the day after I screamed the house down out of rage and frustration. I'm 34 now and my amazing children are 9 & 7. We are here, together, we got through it. You will too. Accept any help that is offered and try and cherish it, you are in return helping them avoid feelings of helplessness. Let your family and friends love you in their own way, even if it means getting used to someone else washing your smalls! And I know it sounds so basic but it really does help, don't forget to breathe. When you start to feel panicky take a deep breath or three. Take care and good luck on your journey. Vicki. xxx",
