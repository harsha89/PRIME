After 4 doses of antibiotics, they decided I didn't and could go home but although I'm on day 5 I've been left feeling absolutely rubbish, still a bit queasy, very burpy and a weird sensation in my oesphagus/stomach like heartburn but isn't.   And now I have the fun of the injections too so here comes the bad back.  I'm ready to feel better now ",

I have been quite honest with my kids, they know mummy has cancer and that the doctors need to give me some medicine that could make me poorly.  They need to be helpful and not too noisy if I'm not well and that mummy might lose her hair.  I took my daughter (shes 8) with me to buy a new hat and they are both coping remarkably well.  My daughter got upset when I first told her as she said she didnt want me to be bald like daddy!

      "Content": "Hi MicheyW We sound like we are on a similar path, I'm in my 30s and a few months ago I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to my lymph nodes.  I still find it hard at times, other than a lump I had no symptoms and the lump appeared very quickly and very big.  I was shocked to be told I had cancer and then was a bitter blow to find it was already out.M My treatment is Zoladex to inhibit my ovaries (I'm going to have them removed later in the year) and letrozole for the rest of the oestrogen and Palbociclib (targeted treatment similar to chemo) to attack the cancer.  Overall, it's not too bad.  Only been on it for a month and fatigue is creeping in but that's mainly because I haven't got used to adjusting and my new way of life. Hope you are doing ok and staying positive.  I think that's half the battle. if you want to chat then happy too",

I was told that peppermint is very good for nausea and is very settling and gentle for the stomach.  I now drink peppermint tea during the day - it is good for fluids and gentle for you. Hope you manage to get it sorted xx",
