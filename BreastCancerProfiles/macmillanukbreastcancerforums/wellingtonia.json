    "Content": "We're all different, so don't worry if you feel differently from those who have contributed to your question. I was probably a bit too matter of fact about my cancer (not breast, so forgive me if I'm on the wrong page). When diagnosed (in 2010) I told, face to face, immediate family and my immediate colleagues at work, so that colleagues could deal with my forthcoming absence. My wife (a retired nurse) told friends. I do not use any \"social media\" so I did not have to think about what to say, and what not to say, on Facebook and similar. Not long previously, a good friend had died from cancer, after a fairly drawn out illness. To my regret, I had been very nervous about even shaking hands with her (she had to wear gloves all the time, because of the sensitivity) as I was so ignorant about all the implications. After my first batch of treatment (very severe side effects, including two or three spells in hospital) I took a slightly \"hold back\" approach and would reply to some people asking how I was, \"It's alright, cancer isn't infectious, contagious or sexually transmitted\" - it helped to break the ice when people do not quite know how to talk to you about it.",
