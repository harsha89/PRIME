      "Content": "Hi Ruby Ruse Thanks for posting this info. I have seen my CNS today for possible medical nipple tattoo . My mastectomy was October 2016 but had chemo and Rx. I am still in limbo as I didn't like the idea if it fading and having to get it retouch annually....and thinking whether I should have a surgical nipple recons-1st, then tattoo after. Can it be done using local or must it be general Anaesthesia. I wonder if you or anyone else has more info on this  Best wishes AZ",

      "Content": "Hi bougiecat Sorry you experiencing numbness in you hands. I am also having similar symptom in all four extremities. I finish chemo in April and RAD June. So still very recent but thought Id reply. I recall the oncologist telling me that such can occur at any time but overtime it would get less but some numbness may persist. There are times when the numbness seems to be improving and other times flares up! Yes typing and washing the dishes seem to increase the discomfort ... I sometimes need to wear gloves when doing the dishes. My GP thinks it is difficult to differentiate as I am having other drugs including Letrozole and Zometa. Of course, please inform your team / specialist nurse or GP. They can explore the problem further with you. If you are very concern about it ,don't wait.  Even only for some reassurance. Best wishes Z",

      "Content": "Hi suzyque63 Had Rt mastectomy with immediate implant/reconstruction in October, 16. I didn't think I could cope with a flat one-sided chest, (especially at work). I was given 2 larger than my DD/E cup front opening non wired bras (complement the hospital charity)  because of post op swelling, twas told. Thanks for these as they are now my everyday bras!(for now). I seem to be getting use to the oddities but when I'm going out ...say certain events, I use a jelly-like prosthesis inside the bra to match my natural Lt breast. This suits me fine as a temporary measure as I plan to reduce the left size to match the implant! Plz ask your breast care nurse about prosthesis. Best wishes with your treatment  ",

      "Content": "Hi All I'm new t this site but enjoyed reading your words of encouragements. My query is I had immediate Rt breast reconstruction during surgery for mastectomy, with the inflatable implant. I have just finished chemo and due to start Radiotherapy. I was told this could cause shrinkage of the implant boob. My options(1) inflate larger b4 radiotherapy or leave as is. Just cant seem to come to a decision after much poundering...im so confused... I am comfortable with the current size of the implant...don't want it bigger but still would not like shrinkage so that my \"fat tummy\" is higher than my chest! Has any one had such experiences with inflatables and shrinking ,what is it like? aculuz65",

      "Content": "Hi Sharmer Welcome to this online forum site .It has been and still is a source of encouragement and support. made me feel braver knowing that I'm not alone and I can ask questions of others who had similar experiences. My story is similar to yours except that the surgeon could not feel any abnormal tissues in my breasts (neither did I! 40 E cup) . Had to repeat mammogram to confirm Invasive ductal carcinoma Rt Breast. I was told it is the most common ca to affect the breast!. I usually self examine. Good on you to identify and sought help. Initially every thing seemed to have picked up pace (felt like, as is frequently described, being on a roller coaster. But things will fall in place as you get a better understanding of treatment, which depends findings and available service in your area. Don't be afraid to ask questions and share your concerns with the team. I am currently having radiotherapy following a mastectomy with reconstruction  and chemotherapy. This site is great at supporting and practical tips. Remember that you are not alone. Best wishes in your care/treatment plan whatever your choice is. Z",
