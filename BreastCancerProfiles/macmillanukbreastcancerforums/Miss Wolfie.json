The list of SE looks as horrid as chemo. also has anyone here tried fasting? Apparently it makes SE better and also chemo more effective. I felt like I was hit by a freight train so not sure if it was worth all the 36 hours of pain.. i will have 4 x EC at two weekly intervals and then 12 paclitaxel every week. Anyone else doing/had the same with words of advice?  Im wondering how I will ever make it!  Thanks all",

I worried it might have been kidneys but I can get into positions where it doesn\u2019t hurt and I have no temperature or urinary symptoms. I found lying on my side with a big pillow between my knees worked. And also massaging with a tennis ball against a wall either side of the spine.  What new and wonderful pains will come up next??? I hope your pain and mine buggers off soon. Let me know if you hear anything from docs. I will mention this on Wednesday to mine. ",

      "Content": "Hi Kathleen I'm not a professional so only from my own research!   The whole chemistry of diet and cancer cells is massively complex I went looking for answers, looked at a zillion research papers to find some magic diet, some superfood, some guarantee i could  get rid of cancer and not have a reoccurrence, but after all this it seems a balanced healthy diet rich in tons of veg, fibre and with no refined sugars still seems boring to be the basis of it all - that along with exercise and finding something that you can be happy with for the rest of your life. Crash diets are bad as they affect metabolism, blood sugars etc which really need to be kept steady.  If you can't sustain a way of eating and then start gaining again its an even more unhealthy picture. I have seen negative comments about getting all your calorie intake from fats in a very low carb (or 'keto') diet, some of them (like Omega 6 from meats) have been shown to boost oestrogen production (though in animals only).  There are claims that a 'keto' diet is the ultimate 'anti cancer' diet but when i got excited by this and look at the actual science there's not really enough evidence for it and a fair amount that looks the other way, saturated fats and estrogen doesn't look a good mix. This is a little article that might be of interest: https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/cancerwise/the-keto-diet-and-cancer--what-patients-should-know.h00-159223356.html I also found this site helpful if you want to do your own research -  it has links to all the latest research on diet and breast cancer - including what you should and shouldn't eat during different types of chemo and also for each different type of BC.  https://foodforbreastcancer.com/amp Apologies for the nerdy load of info - and just again - i'm not an expert but just wanted to share what i've been through in case it helps anyone else looking!   Broccoli anyone??",

      "Content": "Hello all - its been a while but i'm still here.  Been through 4 x EC every 2 weeks and am on 3 of my 12 weekly Paclitaxel.    I'm sharing any tips i've found in case anyone else benefits.  I found EC awful but mainly because of the Filgrastim injections that i needed to give myself to get my white blood cell count up.  They reduced it from 10-8 of the two week period because my side effects from it (breathlessness, liquid in lungs, depression and weakness) were so bad.  If you are suffering similarly tell them - they will reduce if possible.   Other EC side effects after first 2 days of tiredness and a bit of nausea not too bad (i stopped all my anti-sickness meds by day 3 as i wasn't feeling sick and taking them gave me constipation for days!) - taste was disgusting particularly water - so sparkling water worked for me - as did drinking water stored in a copper pan. Adding a tiny (1/4 teaspoon) of honey to savoury foods somehow also seemed to help.  Porridge and soups seemed to be the best foods for not getting any upsets for the first few days following chemo.  I would stick to mainly vegetarian foods for a few days but then would eat (organic if possible) red meat in small amounts as i felt i needed it (i would dream of hamburgers!), also bone broths.  The more i forced myself to move - walk/gym/stretch the less tired i got.  I fasted for 1 day before and on the day of EC and lab/clinical research suggests this is likely to make treatment more effective and possibly protect your own cells -  particularly for any affecting digestion - i did it every time so no idea if it did but certainly didn't want to stop to see if things would get worse!   Paclitaxel so far has been a dream - i feel tired on the day because of the anti-histamines and then have a couple of 'zippy' days because of the steroids but have felt pretty normal. I fast only the night before and the day of and i have experimented with this - if i start to eat on the day of chemo i get pretty instant diarrhoea and if i wait until the next day i don't. I do have a small amount of burning feeling in my feet - its so far not bad and goes after day 4 but i'm aware (and slightly scared!) that i know Paclitaxel builds up over the weeks and side  effects like neuropathy get worse so i am keeping an eye on it. I am using something called Polybalm which is supposed to protect against nail damage.   I am eating throughout all this with the help of one of the latest books on nutrition (published in April) -  the only one my extremely picky (scientist) partner agrees has very robust research behind it and to me makes complete sense and is very reassuring and flexible: Eat to Beat Disease by William Li.  I also have found pure shea butter the best moisturiser for dry skin and great for massaging surgery scars - mine really seem to need a pretty firm hand to stop the area tightening up! Also i got a wig through referral from my oncology team to the wig fitting service at the hospital - this allowed me £250 towards a wig (which makes many of them completely free or makes a human hair wig more affordable).  I then got mine styled by the wonderful Trevor Sorbie himself as part of his charity open to all \"My New Hair' which is an amazing thing!  Also i have taken advantage of free complementary therapies at the amazing Breast Cancer Haven (there are various branches) and found acupuncture really helps with any nausea and fatigue and general feeling better! Finally for anyone who doesn't know, your oncologist can sign you off work and as long as you are on chemo.  There are various means tested benefits you can get but if you have been paying your NI everyone, no matter what you earn or savings you have, is entitled to New style Employment Support allowance.  Macmlllan finance team can help.  Its not much, but as i'm depending on my partner at the moment its just enough to not make me feel completely like I'm bringing nothing in! Anyway sorry for the long post - i just thought, i'm halfway through (almost) and some of this might be helpful!  Big love to every amazing person on here - i'm so inspired by the courage, support, humour and sheer bloody hard work that people are putting into fighting this f****ing hideous disease- thank you so much for posting -  you all are the most help i've had!  xxxx",

However maybe you live a fair way from the hospital in which case it may make sense. I have had EC x4 every two weeks and now in the middle of 12x weekly Paclitaxel, with both of these I didn\u2019t have any immediate reactions and was perfectly able to walk home, but everyone is different.. and yes it is nice to chat to people on the day and see others going through similar - it helps me keep perspective when I\u2019m feeling a bit sorry for myself! Hope that might be helpful! And also: looking at chemo as an unknown quantity ahead of  you is particularly scary so big hugs to you and don\u2019t worry too much- it is all pants no matter how you look at it but one day at a time you will get through as so many others have. xxxx",
