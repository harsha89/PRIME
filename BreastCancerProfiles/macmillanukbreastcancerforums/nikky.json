      "Content": "just wondering if anyone's treatment for bc is similar to mine and can shed some light? I was diagnosed on 5th March 2012 with bc and started my chemo on 28th March. I am due to have 4 rounds of ec and then 4 of doxy. As predicted all of my hair fell out after about 2 or 3 weeks - which was hard but I guess lots of you have been through the same and will know how I feel. After the 2nd round, I noticed that the hairs on my legs started growing back and then there were little sprouts of fluff on my head too. I have now got hair (if you can call it that) which is about a couple of cm long - not enough to go out uncovered but it does wave a bit in a breeze!    Last Wednesday I had my first dose of doxy (taxotere) and was wondering whether the new hair would all fall out again. I know it is not an exact science and all the drugs can make hair fall out, but has anyone had similar drug regimes - has hair lasted or fallen out again.    i am prepared for it to all go again, but I am looking for some shared experiences.   I wish you all good health and a speedy recovery and thanks for any posts.",

      "Content": "thanks for the reply Rosie22 - i wish you well with your treatment.  i am experiencing tenderness in my nails after my first doxy treatment and have read that this is another of those lovely little side effects that we have to go through. It is now 1 week since my doxy and I am starting to feel a little more like I did post EC.  I had poker straight strawberry blonde / auburn hair - asked my hubby what colour the new growth was and he tactfully said \"pale\".  Apparently purple in the \"in colour\" this season.",
