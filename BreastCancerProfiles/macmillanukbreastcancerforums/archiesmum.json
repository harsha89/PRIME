      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I know exactly what you mean. I'm already on ESA for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and fibronyalgia but have been looking for permissable work for two years. Well, the perfect job finally came up, in walking distance from my home, the right amount of hours and the level of pay I'm allowed to earn. I got shortlisted out of over 200 applicants (I live in an area of very high unemployment and deprivation). Was so excited because I generally do very well at interviews and if I get that far 80% of the time I'll get the job. Day before the interview, I got the cancer diagnosis. Well I went to the interview but I was a vegetable and naturally didn't get the job. I certainly wouldn't have given me the job! I have to laugh about it because what else can I do. Never mind, in another 2 years another job might come up! Sorry but for some reason I can't produce paragraphs with my enter key today. Good luck with everything. Christine",

      "Content": "Hi Cerijune I\u2019m fairly newly diagnosed too with two tumours one grade 1 and one 2/3. Like tinkers who has just replied to you, my first surgeon was very negative and told me a mastectomy would be necessary followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The second surgeon was much less negative and I have just started the drug Letrozole (Femara) to see if it will shrink the tumours in the hope that lumpectomies will be possible, it might be weird to others, but for some reason I seem to be obsessed with keeping my nipple! Of course the lumpectomy seems a better option for all sorts of reasons. If the drug doesn\u2019t shrink the tumour \u2013 and they can tell pretty quickly, it looks like it will be a mastectomy. Everything they suggest is just their opinion and you can ask for a second opinion at any time. I was feeling fantastic until a month ago, better than I had felt in years, job interviews, dates, the lot so it is hard when you feel fine to have this happen. My way of dealing with it is to think of it as an annoying inconvenience, that I\u2019ll get through one step at a time, but it\u2019s not going to kill me! Christine",

      "Content": "Hi Looby, I've only been diagnosed for a month but already had conflicting opinions from the two different breast surgeons I've seen. The first was very negative and said there was no chance of immediate reconstruction due to the shrinkage that radiotherapy causes to implants. The second said it was entirely possible and that I wouldn't need radiotherapy. I left there walking on air. However, when I saw the original surgeon the next week, I discovered that what the second one had said to me was not what he had written in his letter to the more senior surgeon. I do so hate being treated like an idiot. However this time, the senior surgeon did concede that a temporary reconstruction could be done with an implant but that I would still need a final reconstruction after chemo/radiotherapy which he believes I will need. Don't know what I'll do in the end. I'm afraid that I won't be able to take the shock of the change to my body. I suffer from major depression and although well at the moment, I'm scared the shock sends me spiralling down. Sorry if this sounds trivial to you but I hope the information above is of some use.

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, I too am newly diagnosed but being treated very differently. I have two invasive breast tumours on the left. They are treating me with Letrozole to see if it shrinks them any then will decide on lumpectomy or mastectomy. Personally, if I can I'll opt for full mastectomy as I don't want to be worrying about it coming back. In terms of not getting enough information from your surgeon. This is shameful. I've seen two different ones who gave me completely different prognosise and suggestions for treatment. Took a list of questions in with me last week and now feel I understand where I stand. I list isn't a bad idea before the consultation because I know for me just being in a breast cancer department makes my mind go blank with fear. Hope you get some answers soon. In fact demand them. christine b",

      "Content": "I'd definitely get it checked out. I'm quite early in the process having only been diangose a couple of months ago. Currently on Femara to try to shrink them with view to lumpectomy possibilities. However, I have had back pain for quite some time with no diangosis being made so although I a am still at an early stage, I am going to ask for a bone scan or MRI or whatever they do to check or I will drive myself crazy with worry and I need to be positive so that my tough old Fife cells can beat the sxxx out of those whimpy cancer cells!
