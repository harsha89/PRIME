      "Content": "Hi ali73 My circumstances are very similar, I was diagnosed with grade 2 invasive ductal cancer with DCIS, 80mm and oestrogen positive, clear nodes. I had a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in May. I have to have radiotherapy and will be on tamoxifen but fell into a grey area for chemo, I had a onco type test and my score was 24, bang slap in the middle of the intermediate range. For me the percentage of recurrence within the next 10 years without chemo is 16% and with chemo it reduces to 8%. Oncologist has said chemo will give me a 'modest' benefit. I'm 45 years old and fit and healthy, my oncologist suggested chemo if I was a 'belt and braces' kind of person. I've spoken to so many people about my situation family, friends, medical professionals and everybody has said I should go ahead with chemo, the only one who isn't keen for me to proceed is my husband he doesn't feel it's worth putting myself through the side effects for the little benefit chemo will give me but that's another story. I've decided to go ahead with chemo,  my first session will be early August, we're away in July, I'm hoping the holiday will set me up for whatever's ahead when I get home. I'm very apprehensive about it and have lots of wobbly moments when I wonder if I'm doing the right thing and then I look at my 18 year old son who's just about to embark on the next stage of his life, uni hopefully, there's so much of his life I don't want to miss and I know I'm doing the right thing. Everybody's circumstances are different, I have a family history of cancer, my mother died from secondary lung cancer at 59 and that was also a big factor in my decision.  I hope sharing my situation has helped a little, it's such a difficult decision to make. Good luck for Tuesday please let us know how you get on.  Sarah x",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, I don't want to take over somebody else's thread but I wanted to answer your questions. I had a fUll body CT scan just after I was diagnosed and it was all clear. I'm based in Essex, I had my surgery at the Essex Nuffield, Brentwood. I will be having 6 sessions of FEC, then radiotherapy and tamoxifen.  Yes my 18 yr old is my only child, I was diagnosed with breast cancer just before he started his A levels, so far he seems to have taken everything in his stride. I told him last weekend I would be having further treatment, reassured him the cancer had gone and having treatment was just to make certain everything is completely gone. He hasn't mentioned anything more to me since.  I'm sure it was a bit of a shock, maybe he's still digesting it. Yes I agree, him going to uni in September will be a good thing, I'd hate for him to see me ill, since my diagnosis I've tried very hard to keep things as normal as I can for him.  It's very interesting to hear about your husband, my husband was a huge support when I was diagnosed and during and after my surgery but he's really struggling with me having the chemo, I know he'll support me, I just wish he was a bit more on board with me. He is trying very hard to see things from my point of view and understand why I would want to put myself through this.  This has been such a hard decision to make and I feel very sorry for anybody who is in a similar position.
