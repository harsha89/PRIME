      "Content": "Thanks Chrissi, ive tried to put this to the back of my mond but as my wedding approaches i am getting more and more obsessed with having children. Pregnant women seem to be everywhere i look. I have tried talking to my oncologist on numerous occasions but i think there is very little research on breast cancer in women of our age so they find it difficult to advise. I am so sorry to here about your secondary cancer - i hope things are going as well as they can for you - thnaks for replying, Emma xxx",
