      "Content": "Hi Just joined as my Mum, aged 85, needs a double mastectomy, due in a couple of weeks. My brother and I are taking time off work to look after her for a couple of weeks but have no idea what to expect. What is she likely to be able to do/ not do herself? I know the obvious ones like not lifting anything, but what about washing, toiletting, getting out of bed? She can do them all now and is the full-time carer for my Dad. Also have no idea how long she'll need help. Will 2 weeks be enough for us to look after her? Any tips you can give me would be much appreciated.Â ",
