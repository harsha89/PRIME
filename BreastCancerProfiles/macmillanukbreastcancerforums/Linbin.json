Thanks. Lin x",

      "Content": "Hi, I have just joined up this morning as after lying awake for 3 hours over past few nights I decided that I should ask for help from the people that understand what I am experiencing. I was diagnosed early April 2018 and fortunately for me they have decided to treat me with Letrozole to reduce the lump prior to surgery.  This is a great outcome as I can hopefully avoid all Chemo.  My problem is that I had to immediately come off HTR, which I had been on for 10 years and start Letrozole.  Over the past 4 months I have had to get used to night sweats and sleepless nights.  What I am having trouble coping with are the aching joints and feeling like 90 years old as I try to climb the stairs ( I am 60 and live up in a first and second floor appartment with only stairs) Every part of my body seems to ache.  I have for the past few years tried to walk 4 miles 3 times a week, but now it feels like I am dragging myself around the park.  Any ideas for supplements or techniques that have helped you that I can try. When I mentioned my symptoms to my nurse she did tell me that by taking me off HRT and putting me on Letrazole they had aged me 20 years!!!!  I just need some ideas to help me keep moving easily. Looking forward to hearing from you",
