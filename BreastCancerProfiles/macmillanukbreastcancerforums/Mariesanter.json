      "Content": "Hi Bev, So sorry to hear you're having such a bad time.  I was in a very similar situation after my tax aside from constipation (which I suffered with terribly after FEC). My pains lasted around 7 days and I also suffered from a lot of vomitting so it was 10 days after tax that I started feeling human again. I just did as little as possible, slept on top of covers with fan on constantly and took codeine regularly. Sorry can't be of any real help but you will feel better very soon although I'm sure it doesn't feel like it at the minute!!  I didn't think I would ever feel better but woke on day 10 with loads of energy feeling absolutely grand!!! Take care Marie x",

      "Content": "Hi Bev, I had my first doc 10 days ago after having had FEC and it was around 3 days later that I began with the muscle/joint/bone aches. Not nice felt very fluey. Then 7 days later nausea and vomiting. I didn't suffer as much with the FEC to be honest and its only today that I'm feeling good again but no probs with hands/feet. Taste buds are a bit weird still but no mouth ulcers or soreness really. I've had more issues with my nose which is dry and sore and just dripping freely (most attractive) which I assume is due to lack of nose hair? For me it hadn't been pleasant at all but I've got through and feel ALIVE today.  Such a good feeling!!!!!! Good luck!! Marie x",
