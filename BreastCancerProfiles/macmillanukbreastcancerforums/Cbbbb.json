      "Content": "Hi I'm not sure if I'm putting this post on in the right place but wanted to share something with you guys suffering from night sweats with tamoxifen.  I'm 44 years old and have been taking tamoxifen since October last year. The side effects haven't been too bad other than the severe night sweats. These were waking me at least 3 times a night, when I had to change the bedding and pjs (I could almost wring them out!) anyways I have found a few solutions that work for me that I wanted to share. I bought a climate control duvet from Aldi £11.99 !!! A fan light and my best discovery most recently has been the \"chillmax pillow\" it is fantastic ! It's more like a small baby changing blanket with crystals in that needs no prep, no time in the fridge etc it just works ! It can be used between your pillow and pillow case to keep head cool or I use mine under my bottom sheet and lie on it. ( I actually have bought 2 to give longer coverage ) you can buy on eBay, amazon or from Wilkinson £9.99.  This has almost stopped my night sweats or if I do have them it's only once a night now so I'm getting a decent night sleep.   Maybe worth a go ? Xxxx ",
