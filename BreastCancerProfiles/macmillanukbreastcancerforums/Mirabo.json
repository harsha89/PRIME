As far as researching, yes, you can find all sorts of information on the web.  And some of it's good information, but more often it's worst case scenarios or out of date information.  My suggestion to you is to use the MacMillan search bars and dig your information out that way.  You'll at least hear real life stories from people walking in the same shoes you've been given.  And you'll hear both positives and negatives.  Get your facts first and then if you want to visit Dr. Google, you can do so armored with facts.  It's all a bit overwhelming unless you're able to look at only a piece at a time.   I wish I could give you a good back rub.  I understand your sense of overwhelming sadness.  I'm hoping by the time you read this you'll be on one of the up swings of our roller coaster ride.  I've never liked roller coasters particularly well.  But yes, you're very correct.  The brain runs riot on you.  You over think, over worry and over imagine all sorts of things.  I know you've heard this, but a repeat won't hurt.  Do things that are special to you.  Try to have a little fun.   You can't rush time and the next step in your journey may seem very far off, but I assure you that it will be on top of you before you know it.  Since I can't offer you a nice relaxing massage, I'm sending another gentle, virtual hug.  Keep me posted!  xxoo Mira",

      "Content": "Good Morning Anna K: Welcome to the site that no one wants to join!  I say that with a chuckle, because of course you don't want to have to be researching and finding out about BC, but I can tell you that you've found the best place to stay up to date and informed.  I live in the States and am actually in 2 BC groups here, but they are not nearly as responsive or informative or friendly as this one.   You sound a lot like me in your attitude.  Just kind of grit your teeth and get on with it.  That was one of my major issues.  The getting on with it part.  It seems like there is so much waiting and guessing and wondering and sometimes panicking that you feel your life is out of control.  That's a portion of the roller coaster that London Lass referred to.  But hang on to this thought, You're going to have lots of good days and you'll have some upsetting ones as well.  During the waiting times use the wait to get yourself as well informed as possible about the who, what, where, why and when of everything connected with your your next step to keep yourself well informed and build an arsenal of questions.  I'm a Navy vet and I thought of it as \"battle prep\" time.  And now, post surgery and post RT I think I won the war.  Of course we'll be sending out surveillance teams to stay safe, but for me, the hardest part is done.  So here I am to offer a hand and to walk a distance with you.  You'll likely find others who are on a closer path and may develop some wonderful support buddies on here, but you have a whole group of us out here to be your cheerleaders as well as to be a shoulder when you need to cry. As far as your scans - they can serve 2 purposes.  One of course is to check for abnormalities elsewhere, and the other is to serve as a base line for future reference.  Both of the scans you mentioned are painless.  But they both provide you and your team with lots of information.   I'll be thinking of you lots this week and sending energy, peace and strength your way.  Hugs, Mira",

      "Content": "Hi Lucy: I'm post menopausal and only been on Letrozole for about 5 months.  I was on the Femara brand and had no issues with it.  The pharmacy arbitrarily switched me to a generic and bad symptoms began cropping up rapidly.  I saw my Dr. and she said to quit the generic immediately.  Now she's going head to head with the pharmacy trying to get me back on to the Femara.  If pharmacy won't change she said that she would entirely change my meds.  I believe her first choice is going to be Exemestane which is a steroidal AI, but she did mention possibly putting me on Tamoxifen.  I told her that I thought Tamoxifen was just for pre-menopausal woman and she told me that it is usually prescribed for pre-menopausal, but also works for post-menopausal.  It's not quite as effective as Letrozole and Anastrozole, but it does work.  For now I'm on nothing until this battle between Oncologist and Pharmacy is determined, but I'm wondering if Exemestane might not be the way to go.  I'm reading that it causes less bone loss and irreversibly prevents the production of oestrogen even after coming off the drug.  The other 2 AI's will allow oestrogen to begin to be produced again.  Hope that was helpful.  Mira",

I did wear a sleeve every day for about 2 months.  I don't need it now.  I do wear compression bras every day and do manual lymph drainage nearly every day.  They're not so bad, especially if they're fitted properly - and most of them have a \"pocket\" in them if you're in need of a prosthesis.  To be honest I hadn't even considered a prosthesis until after my last Physical Therapy and my PT put Kinesio tape on my breast.  That was a WOW!  I guess there was so much lymph pooled in there, that when it drained off, the breast literally shriveled down 2 full sizes!  I've gotten 3 bras so far.   Two are Amoena sports bras and the other is a Bellisse compression vest.  The Bellisse I only wear at home.  It's quite cumbersome feeling but the other two are very comfy.  I'm allowed to get 3 more after February and the fitter told me I should get one of their \"pretty\" bras for dressing up.  I like that idea! As far as the infection brewing, I'm sure your antibiotics will get that nasty little surprise under control quickly and am so very glad you listened to us on here and got the the Doctor before the holidays.  Good Job!  As with all things, knowing and knowledge gives you power over the unexpected surprises we're constantly getting from this horrid disease.   I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and are feeling more comfortable now.  Keep that arm elevated and please do look up some lymph drainage stuff on YouTube!  Even if you don't start the massage, it will give you a better idea of what to expect.   Please keep us posted!  Hugs, Mira",

Thanks for listening.  XXOO Mirabo",

      "Content": "Hi there soveryscared:  I'm in Florida and not too close to you, but our health care systems have to be similar.  If you're still frightened, get a second opinion.  Actually, if I didn't have great confidence in my health care system, I'd have opted for the University of Florida Health Care Systems.  Top notch!  You went to the University of Michigan Health Care Systems  and they too are top notch.  I would have a high degree of confidence if they told you it's not a worry, but if you need reassurance please see a different Doctor.  I did my radiation with the University of Florida Health Care Systems, and the Nurse Practitioner there was very, very well trained.  If she told me it wasn't an issue, I'd accept that.   Carolyn is right.  You need to calm down.  You don't need to make yourself sick over this.  Get another opinion and then trust them.  You're a bit young to be getting breast cancer, but it's certainly not impossible.  I found mine by accident and it was a fairly painless lump that felt rather numb.  No pink marks or blisters.  Other people have different outward symptoms and some people have no outward symptoms at all.  You said your NP told you it could be a macule.  If it's rather flat and not raised up that's certainly a possibility.  But the best part is that it's unremarkable enough for them to call it benign.  If you choose to get a 2nd opinion, you might start with your gynecologist and then move on to a dermatologist.   My hope is that you'll be less frightened and get a plan to help you deal with what ever is cropping up.  Keep in mind that if you're having a dermatological issue, your NP from the breast clinic may not be well versed in what she's seeing.  My Physical Therapist Doctor told me flat out that she wasn't good with derma issues and referred me on.  Last thing I want to add is that even if you have developed BC, it's become very, very treatable.  So follow up, get a 2nd opinion and then revamp.  If you need us we're here to listen.  Hugs, Mira",
