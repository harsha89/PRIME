      "Content": "Hi there, I feel sick writing this.. I had always had lumpy breasts and yearly check ups and clear mammogram in Dec..but over last few weeks I noticed a lump so thought as getting a few menopause type symptoms perhaps it was linked and made dr apt for next Monday. However today the lump felt so big I made emergency apt with dr who was surprised at the size and has referred me.. I feel sick and panic and the wait for ref apt is going to be so tough.. I saw the site through my scrolling on google and have joined.. So hello and I feel very sad and scared.",

      "Content": "Oh Thankyou so much Dreamthief for your lovely reply .. I had a referral two years prev on other breast and it was aspirated and biopsy all fine and I wasn't in the least upset or worried because I was adamant it was a cyst or similar.. This time I feel adamant that I will be receiving a diff result .. How can it have grown so fast ? ( that's rhetorical as no one can answer that and the waiting is all that is certain at this point) I want to cry and hide and scream and be sick and not have any lump at all.. I will def keep on this forum .. Sorry for whining and thanks once again for your great message xx",

      "Content": "An update- I posted elsewhere re changing my NHS apt from next Thursday to this Thursday by going to private hospital where my NHS consultant works as I was going mad with the thoughts in my head.. Anyway I had my apt today consultation examination and ultrasound Â and it was a gigantic cyst.. Consultant drained it for me.. Words can't express this week and now my relief but also my feelings regarding everyone who has helped me via this site and my friends and colleagues.. Life can change in five mins and no one knows what's coming but I will remember this week and adjust my thinking because of it.. I wish everyone well and may be on here again but for now, thankyou and best wishes. Kay",

I will prob go to work tnrw as staying at home I will flip I think.. Thanks for taking time to talk X",
