    "Content": "My 23 year old daughter was diagnosed last week with grade 3 IDC. This has hit us really bad, especially her youngest sister who is 18. I am amazed at the way my eldest is handling this. I know she must be terrified as we all are. I also know that there will be a time when she will come crashing down. She has a SLN biopsy on Monday so we are praying they find nothing ominous, followed by mastectomy on Friday. I'm hoping I can find support from this site to help her and our family get through this.",
