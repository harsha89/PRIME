      "Content": "Hi, This is my first time here. My doctor is not the most endearing man and I find him hard to understand. So I'm hoping you guys may be able to help me a little. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in Dec 15 after I found a lump and had a mammogram/biopsies etc. Treatment plan was chemo for 18 weeks then mastectomy.  In Jan 16, I had a biopsy under my left arm and when I returned for the results I was told surgery wasn't viable as the cancer is in numerous lymph nodes. I was told all that can be done is try to hold the cancer back and I have approx 2 years of life expected. I was shell shocked and not sure I took everything in to be honest! I just listened and left, I didn't ask questions. So today I received a copy of the letter sent from my consultant to my GP and I'm even more confused- it says I'm stage IIIA, T3, N1, M0, G2. Her2+ ER neg. what has confused me is that it says they think the can control my metastatic load for 2 years and if so will consider cosmetic approach to breast and left axilla if not just concentrate on treating metastatic load. Unless I'm reading wrong, it doesn't sound like I have 2 years to live?! What would your thoughts be? Sorry if I've waffled but my consultant is not someone I feel comfortable asking all this to especially when I struggle to understand his accent. You'd have thought he was telling me I had a cold when he gave me my diagnosis. Thankyou in advance.",

      "Content": "Thankyou all for your replies. I have had my first chemo 2 weeks ago. I have been told surgery is no longer feasible because of the cancer found in my left axillary lymph node and left clavicular node? I'm wondering if the stage IIIA, T3, N1, M0, G2. Her2+ ER neg bit of my letter hasn't been updated after what they found last week? x",
