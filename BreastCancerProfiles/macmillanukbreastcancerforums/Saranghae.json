      "Content": "Excersise definitely helps! My mum has stage three breast cancer and is due this week for her 5/6 chemo to shrink tumour for surgery. We got good news a couple of weeks back that the chemo his working and she should be ready for surgery after her 6th. Just taking it one step at a time is the best way,sometime I find myself worrying about the far future and looking up rates of reoccurrence but I realise its not helpful and nor is cancer that predictable. I'm also in Korea so its been tough,but I'll be back in august and so should be there just in time for surgery. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube helps ! ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My Mum has an ulcerating tumour (non agressive, hole in breast). The doctors said she would need chemo to shrink it before surgery as it was quite large and had probably been there a long time. After her 4th chemo they did an ultrasound and the technician said it had shrunk quite dramatically and the doctor said she should be definately ready for a massectomy after her 6th chemo. Now just before her 5th chemo the doctor said it's grown and is bleeding a little, she said it could be the blood and bruising that's making it look bigger as it's 'squishy'. Originally she said most people have a cell blast chemo halfway through (once every week for 9 weeks) but she said my mum was doing so well on the chemo and that it's also not compatible with Lithium (which my mum takes for bi polar). Now she's changed her mind and said people on lithium has had it and has been ok. They're meeting next week to discuss whether to do surgery first and then cell blast chemo or the other way around. I live abroad until August so I can't ask questions myself and my mum isnt the best at asking for information. What will make them determine which way round to give it? Isi t better before or after? Is she going to feel a lot worse having this kind of chemo as she has coped amazingly on the once every 3 weeks one. Sorry for the questions but I seem to get more information off here than from my mum.",

      "Content": "Thanks for replying! I'm not sure exactly what she was on. It's horrible not being there to ask questions myself. Docetaxel sounds familiar though. I was really gutted this morning when I heard as so far upto chemo 5 it's been going as well as could be in terms of her coping and the tumour shrinking. I know it's quite common to move onto the weekly one and that it has its benefits but it still seemed like bad news. I guess I will find out more next week when both her doctors decide whether to operate first or after. If they do the cell blast weekly treatment for 9 weeks it will mean at least I will be there when she has the mastectomy. ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone , so my mum who has a large ulcerating(come out of skin) tumour has finished all her chemo. Unfortunately the tumour has only shrank a little but the doctor described it as stable and unattached. She also has no lymph node involvement and its not described as aggressive but obviously was there a long time. Its hormone receptive. Im worried about surgery (masectomy) as i read its more complicated the larger the tumour and the higher rates of reoccurence. Has anyone here had a large tumour removed? Can her prognosis be ok despite size? Shes currently waiting on an appointment being made with the surgeon.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply :) I dont know exactly how big it is except its pretty large and ulcerated the skin. My mum doesnt ask specifics just follows doctors and treatment plans which is frustrating. Actually at the beginning they told her it was all over and had reached the chest wall but it seems that was infection from the tumour and not cancer. Shes not worried about surgery think shes more nervous theyll say its unoperable but her doctor thinks she will have surgery. ",
