      "Content": "Yes, BRCA positive. I have the cancer gene that will attack my ovaries next. Since I am 39 and already have 2 boys, I am ok with them taking out my ovaries. I have rather large breasts and I am a little worried about the mastectomy. I am ok with not having them, just not sure how I will handle the huge adjustment. time will tell.",

      "Content": "I am glad you posted this question. I have a treatment next week, and I got a case of coughing, sore throat and hurting in chest from a co-worker. (If you are sick, stay home!) I called the doctor and they are calling me in some antibiotics to treat it before it becomes an infection. I felt at ease after reading all the replies to your original post. This \"journey\" that we are all going through is not as scary when I know there are people out there that can relate and offer advice. Thank you all very much! I have learned a lot from this blog.",
