    "Content": "Hi J-A,  This happens in the beginning. Most people are well meaning without realising what is going on in our minds.  I also faced similar situations but understood the insensitivity of some of my friends and we'll wishers (?). How I see cancer is just like any other debilitating disease. Some other diseases are more morbid so don't think too much..let your family build a cordon round you and try to protect you, as far as possible, from such situations and comments.  My family has done this and it has helped me insulate from such comments.  There is life beyond all this. So cheer up and take care.",
