      "Content": "Hiya,  I had a double mx in 2010 after having 2 cancers in my left breast. Usual chemo, rads, tamox (until I became pregnant).  I gave birth to my twin girls a week ago and have noticed that there is a significant thickening in my right breast next to the mx scar / reconstructed nipple.  Now it feels just the same as my original finding, but i am not sure if it may be something to do with the hormones post pregnancy? I have not had sore boobs etc as obviously the breasts have been removed, but still..? Will have to wait to see my GP on Monday, but concerned about it already.  xx",

      "Content": "Hi, sorry I'm not whether this is the right place to post....I need some advice, I had a double mastectomy in 2010 after being diagnosed with BC end of 2009 (aged 29). I am now 32y and pregnant with twins (!) but obviously I am already getting upset at the thought of not being able to breastfeed like I did with my other 3 little ones.It sounds odd but do you think I will be able to get formula milk on prescription as I physically cannot breastfeed?Just thinking about the cost of formula milk for 2 babies!I get so fed-up of the relentless pushing of breastfeeding in everything I read, I look forward to the day that someone gives me the wrong look when I am bottle feeding my very young babies and judge me, they will get the brunt of it!.xx",

      "Content": "Hiya, yes I actually feel like I don't want to tell anyone else. I actually have found it easier to text friends and extended family as it make it more upsetting for me to see people's reaction when I tell them face to face. I was diagnosed today so it is all still sinking in and I am 29 so kind of thought it wouldn't happen to me at this age.   Paula xxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies! Do you mind if I join you on here? I had my 1st FEC last Thursday 11th and had a bit of a nightmare as started being very sick only a few hours afterwards and ended up in hospital on Friday (for 2 days) on fluids. I had a grilled chicken sandwich a couple of hours after chemo and started to get ill just after eating it...wouldn't surprise me if I ate something dodgy! It's day 6 now and have a sore throat and my mouth feels a bit tender like I have loads of ulcers waiting to show themselves. I am managing to eat small amounts but nothing adventurous, grapes, apples, melon, broccolli, cereal and toast is all I can manage at the moment. I keep getting terrible heartburn and literally am swigging gaviscon from the bottle. I had to sit with my arm in a sink of hottish water to get my veins up for 1st dose, must remember to drink loads before I go in again for my 2nd dose on 30th. Paula xx",
