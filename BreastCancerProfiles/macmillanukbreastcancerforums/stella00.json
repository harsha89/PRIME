    "Content": "Hello  My name is Stella, I want to share with you my aunt story and ask your advises and how i can support her and make her having better thoughts. She leaves in albania,  when she went to check her breast because she was in pain they where telling her that she doesn't have anything and everything is good( i dont know what to say for these doctors) But my mum who leaves in Greece convinced my aunt to go to greece and to do the check again. From the first xrays  the nurses were saying  that it is obvious  this is cancer, and she went straight to a very good doctor and had the surgery. After the surgery she went back to albania to do the chymio where her family leaves and  feel home Tomorrow she is doing the 3rd chymio i am really concern about her and how she is dealing with all situation I am putting my self in her position i feel how lost and sad she should be let me say some things about her so you understand the situation  She leaves  in a small village in Albania, all her life is her family and she knows almost everyone who leaves at the same village and they know her.  The way of thinking is very very old and not helpful at all for her to deal with  Like a personality she is very serious, shy, closed and i always remember her  thinking what the other people at the village will say  For her to find out that she has cancer and to  go to an other country for the surgery ( and the surgery to be done by men that she doesn't even know and she doesn't understand what they are telling her and then to tell her that they took out all the breast and she needs to chymio  i think was a big shock on the top of the pain of what happened What concerns me is she hasnt show her emotions to anyone her husband daugher son sister noone she says that she is okay and we should not get stressed for her and she feels bad because she made us sad and i am sure a big thing on her mind are the other people from the village what they say i am asking her daugter how she is doing and she says that she doesn't show her emotions and she hasn't see her without the wig how we can get closer to her and make her express what she feels  Me i am leaving in london and is not easy to go and talked with her a lot    about how she is feeling and make her laugh and take her out to the sea and do with her creative things nad  read to her everything about the cancer and chymios and the most important  the lifes of other  womens that have been through the same true life challenges that other women had and  how they are feeling and what they did be so strong  i feel that for a person that not be able to inform himself by read and haveing access to the internet and search and read exactly whats happening should be such a hard thing and the thoughts they should have could be very wrong  please any tips that helped you and any advises about things can relax her and open up would give me a good idea about how she is feeling thank you very much, for reading my aunties story  keep being inspiring and strong  love stella ",
