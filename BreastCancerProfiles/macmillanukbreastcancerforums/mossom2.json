The hardest part for me now is the boredom while having treatment. I'm trying to learn to be patient and relax. Big Hugs x",

It just doesn't feel right though it's sore and more sensitive than before the biopsy is that normal?  Also between now and my surgery what am I supposed to do in terms of activity do I just carry on with my normal daily tasks or do I take it easier? Ridiculous as it sounds I'm scared that if I do to much then it will make the cancer worse??  I just carried on going to work till my surgery as it took my mind off it. My boob had big purple bruise but was only sore for 3/4 days. X",

I can honestly say this is the hardest thing I've ever done and I have had 4 natural childbirths.  My feet aren't painful but sometimes feel like there are bubbles popping on the soles when I'm sitting. My hair fell out on the first TCH but 3rd tomorrow and I have about half cm grown back already. I must have strong hair follicles.  Lol xxx",

My question is when it starts what is it like? Could I wake up in the morning fine, walk the dog, get to the supermarket and find I start shedding? Do I need to carry a scarf with me everywhere I go now? Any experience please? after my first chemo I got headache and prickly scalp on day 15 and the next day started shedding. It took a week to loose it all. I took advice from someone on here and paid 25 quid for revita folic stimulating shampoo. Cycle 3 tomorrow and I've got half centimetre of hair grown back.
