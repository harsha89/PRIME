      "Content": "I hope you feel better soon! I am a two year survivor and my hair is now shoulder length. I take care with my diet and I think it has helped. I actually miss wearing scarves and hats and now that winter is coming I will be using them again even though I have hair. I cried many times during the days losing my hair, but I got used to it after a couple of months. I hated losing my eyebrows more. They grew back in very quickly though and I refused to draw on fake ones (I hate that look!) I would wear a chemo cap and then tie a long fancy scarf on top of that and let it fall down my back. If you are going somewhere nice, add high heel boots and dangly earrings and people think you're making a fashion statement! That gives you confidence and stops the \"Poor Girl with Cancer\" looks! Good luck. (P.S. It's only hair at the end of the day. If somebody has a problem with that, too bad!!)",

      "Content": "One of the worst things about my chemo was the lack of sleep. It was torture. I would wake up after 1 or maybe 1 1/2 hrs of sleep in a very agitated state. It plays tricks with your mind! Finally, I solved the problem my keeping the TV on all night. That way, I would watch a bit and fall back off to sleep again and the programs kept me distracted and enabled me to stop thinking about cancer at 1 am! Thinking too much in the middle of the night is too often negative thinking! The only thing I made sure of was to watch silly things like \"Next Top Model\" etc (ha,ha) When I see a TV chef now that I used to watch, I feel like he is a friend! I have learned to sleep properly now that I am well. I can nap whenever I want because my trick is to not worry about it. If you lie there angry that sleep isn't coming, you'll take hours to sleep. I say to myself \"Never mind, you can just rest here all night and not sleep\" Then I'm asleep in 5 minutes!! One other thing, after my treatment was over, I spent about two months sleeping for about 15 hours every day. I was exhausted from all those sleepless nights and I made it up. I feel great today after two years and YOU WILL TOO! Good luck!",
