      "Content": "Hi tinkers, It was comforting to hear your experience and once again another person is pleased with the results,  As Im not a very sporty person apart from a bit of hiking now and again that's one thing I do not need to consider too much.  Your suggestions about questions to ask was very helpful and will help me decide which one is best for me, I have my appointment this week so hopefully it will be one less thing to worry about. LOL. At my age I'm still vain enough to like a nice flat stomach and a free tummy tuck does sound apealing.LOL Thanks again and I hope things continue to go well.    ",
