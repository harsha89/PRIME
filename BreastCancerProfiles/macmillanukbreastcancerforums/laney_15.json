    "Content": "Hi Amanda,  I am so sorry to hear your news.  a cancer diagnosis is shocking, upsetting and scarey and your reactions are totally normal. my diagnosis came last December so I hope you will believe me when I say you will get through.  You've done the hardest bit in telling your daughters - try to take one step at a time and if you can I would encourage you to tell someone in your circle of family and friends how you are really feeling. There's lots of advice on here and also if you have a Maggies centre near your hospital make use of the help and support that they offer.  You are not alone in this.  Your message ended on a very positve note I felt....you have found a new friend in me and I'm sure there will be many others who will stand with you in your fight against this dreadful disease.   Sending you lots of love and hugs and prayers xx ",
