    "Content": "Hi Sarah . Like you I have just been diagnosed with Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, I'm 48 . I'm having a Lumpectomy beginning of next week, I wanted a Mastectomy but the doctors talked me round to a Lumpectomy as my tumour is what they call \"small\" (16mm at iopsy point) so they think they can get it all out . Waiting is the pits, I think I've driven myself round in circles searching info which is really not a good idea other than on \"trusted sites\" .  My children are 17 and 27 ",
