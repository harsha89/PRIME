      "Content": "I've just arrived home after my MX and sentinel node biopsy on Tuesday/yesterday. (actually I couldn't finish this last night so I'm posting on Thursday .. Not that that matters...) I arrived at 7 and was first on the list so the op began about 8. As you guys had reassured me, the general anaesthetic itself was fine. There were a bunch of people joking and chatting to me then I felt fuzzy and nice as whatever they put  in the catheter began spreading through my body then the mask went over my face and next thing I knew was people calling my name in the recovery ward. I was confused - Id been having nice dreams and didn't think I could have had the operation. First thing I did was lift the gown to see the dressing. It looked nice and tidy.  I felt relatively pain free for most of the day - just fuzzy and a bit wobbly. Thought I would read magazines, but reading text wasn't easy.  I spent from 7 until five falling asleep and waking. Around 5 I needed to go to the bathroom, and it was agony to sit up, walking was even worse. It felt like an elephant stomping on my chest and was difficult to breathe. I got painkillers but these did nothing to help - I basically couldn't move and every I breath was agony. I kept asking for more painkillers but they kept saying okay then not coming back. Around ten I had to go to the bathroom again and it was even more intense and I burst into tears, which hurt even more.  This whole time I felt stupid and weak because I knew it wasn't meant to hurt like this at all. I closed my bay curtains and cried and cried as silently as I could and began hyperventilating like a panic attack. A nurse support worker found me when she came to ask about lunch, and she got a nurse. The nurse released the vacuum on my drain and the relief was instant! Apparently the drain can pull on nerves which lead to this jabbing crushing pains I was having. If only the baby doctor I had seen (who promised painkillers but never gave them to me) had known about this.  They left the vacuum off all day. I had Been meant to go home by 12, but the registrar didn't make it to see me and I had to wait for blood results and they wanted to see how I went when they changed the bottle drain, which would probably be removed the next morning. To save going home just to sleep then coming back to hospital, I was going to stay in another night. But then the doctor said as I was losing so little fluid, I could leave that evening. I had to spend another hour with a new bottle - again the same agony when I moved - but basically nothing came out so I was free to leave! Yay!  Fitted with a softie, walked to the car fine, everything fine. Just tired.  So, another ladyboy in the club! I'm justr about to get my OH to take a photo before I have a shower and remove the dressings .. Now the 2 week wait for more results. I'm feeling quite practiced at waiting.  Thanks all for sharing your experiences beforehand.... I love this community.",

      "Content": "Good luck with your MX Shelley. As sassy has said, what happened to me is not at all normal. It also wouldn't have gone on so long if I was more assertive and not so worried about being seen to be crying by the nurses. As everyone here has said, the pain really isn't that bad. So, if you are in really intense pain that painkillers don't ease, do tell them! Day 3 now and I could probably get by with no paracetamol at all. Had my bra and softie on, but have just taken them off as the bra goes right across the drain wound. I know I was helped a great deal by hearing from the other wonderful women before my surgery, so am thrilled I can help others. Sassy - I can't see your post As I write this reply, but thanks! I had some visitors today which was nice, but really I just want to read the trashy magazines I have got. I being well looked after anyway.",

      "Content": "I got the results/outcome from my mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy today - 13 days after the surgery. The tumour was 27mm and grade 3. Two nodes were taken and cancerous cells were in one of them. ER+. Don't know about the HER thing yet. I think she said there was extensive lymphovascular invasion too. The plan is: chemo to start in about 2 weeks (pending appt with oncologist) - about 5 months, followed by node clearance surgery in Jan/Feb, then 3-5 weeks of radiotherapy, then hormone treatment. And there goes the next year of my life. But it's one year out of what will be many more years given than I'm getting this treatment to completely destroy the evil cancer that is failing to kill me. Today, it's real. It feels real. I'm getting a sense of what it means to have cancer. I feel less outside of myself, and outside of the world. I am in the world, with cancer. Aside from the treatment, I'm focused on the less promising aspects of the results. That it is aggressive. That she is worried. That there was lymphovascular involvement. I'm only one month and one day post diagnosis. One month and eight days ago, I was convinced I had a lump of fat in my breast and they were going to treat me like a hypochondriac. I was too young, and seemed to think that believing I wouldn't get breast cancer meant I wouldn't get breast cancer. But, here we are. Gosh. I can't talk honestly with people. I need to be positive *for them* - not for me. I couldn't tell my mum it is a fast-growing cancer. I have to focus on the 'the treatment will make me well' story. But that's not the story I want to tell. I want to be able to be honest about how I feel, but we have to think about other's feelings. They aren't living this like we are and are much more sensitive to potentially terrible news. And that's frustrating. Okay, vent over. Just wanted to share. In any case I feel much more prepared for what is ahead of me by hearing how you beautiful strong women have handled things. Thank you.",

      "Content": "I could have written this post! Except I am post 6th chemo, and currently in for the 5th time ... I just ignored the temp on the second cycle as it wasn't that high. On tax my temp spikes to around 37.6 nearly every day. Except for a gum infection n the first cycle they have never found a reason for the 'infection'. Anyway, it's horrible. Almost as bad as the actual temp and feeling rubbish is constantly being on edge and wondering whether to call the hospital, whether to take pain relief etc etc ... On tax I use codiene and oromorph because the pain is intense and this doesn't mask a fever. Ibuprofen is less likely to mask the fever than paracetamol - though when my temp has been really up, paracetamol doesn't bring it down. Hate being in here and feel silly as I am surrounded by people far sicker than me with my silly little temp. But scared to go home in case it goes up . Each time I come and go it is £20 for a taxi. The one time I really did need to come in for a temp was when they had discharged me in the afternoon but my temp went up to 39.1 in the evening and I was too ill to manage going back in - including paying for taxi, and leaving my teenage daughter alone ... Sorry for hijacking the post with my own whine! Oh, and be warned that many find tax incredibly emotionally gruelling - it has made me fall apart - but my steroids were halved and it is better this round - so far.",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy with no reconstruction and I doubt I will ever want a reconstruction. A main reason w that i just wanted to get on with things - recover quickly and get on with more treatment. I was put off by the stats on reconstructions going wrong and needing to be redone. And that it would be some time before my other very droopy boob would be lifted so i would effectively be more lopsided than i would be with a prosthesis, for at least a year. Radiotherapy wasn't certain and I didn't want to risk any reconstruction being ruined (turns out I will need radiotherapy so I'm very pleased with my decision!). I couldn't bear the idea of anyone touching a fake boob that gave me no sensation whatsoever. I've never had cleavage, and prosthesis in a bra can give a decent enough illusion of double breastedness. I don't feel less of a woman - perhaps more of a woman. I didn't have my breast removed - I had cancer removed and it happened to be in my breast. If anyone else, partner or whatever, had any issues about my one breast I don't want them in my life. No reconstruction was my initial gut decision, but the surgeon seemed very much for a reconstruction which made me wonder if I was being stupid about it. I had a few very difficult days - apparently many women just 'know' straight away what is right for them. I went through pros and cons over and over, talking it out. It turned out that I kept coming up with cons for reconstruction and pros for no recon. When I tested out deciding on no recon, I felt calm and knew it was right for me. I found a website called something like breast free to be helpful, educational and empowering. In the end it is a massively personal decision. Many here couldn't comprehend the decision I have made ( and the nurses and consultants I see all assume I want a fake boob at some stage). The trick is to find out what you think and want. Test out each decision and see how well it fits for you. Good luck, and hugs.",

I am just wondering about the lifting issue - to what extent do you have to avoid heavy lifting? If, say, you were to move house, would you not be able to lift any boxes using both arms? Among other things I am wondering whether to sort out all the stuff in my office (tonnes of books and papers) before the op. What if you want to move a bit of furniture and need both arms?

I tried posting in the breastcancercare forums and had trouble there too - is this a sign I should be avoiding online communities! Anyway, I'm here now. There's lots I wanted to respond to but e main things were to thank you all for your support when I wrote my miserable whiny post. You really helped me pull myself up a bit. And I wanted to add my voice to say to Sacha rose - don't you dare leave us! Just to update ... Things suddenly went really fast! I had the meeting with the chemo nurse on thurs and she said I was beginning chemo the very next day! I wasn't prepared like I had meant to be ... A big shopping list, plans in place, work things I had wanted to have sorted out. Anyway, I spend the first night (FEC) incredibly nauseous and vomiting great quantities. Anti sickness pills clearly not effective. Snce then, tiredness and a slight queasiness but nothing like the first evening. I have something like ME so I'm not sure if my aching and sore throat is to do with that or the chemo. Please remind me - is there worse to come in terms of side effects this round? what will happen when I stop the steroids? The nurse said that was usually hard on people. And will I start feeling rubbish as my blood count drops? I suddenly feel like I dont know what is likely to happen. I am muddled .. And right now, very tired. Steroids woke me at 5. And I'm stressed about managing work and sick leave and everything. But my daughter is being lovely and I am very grateful for that. And my partner is also being lovely, Have to go now .... Sleep.

But, right now I am 6 days away from my first real pathology report and treatment plan and I'm doing what I did post-biopsy and pre-diagnosis: fretting and freaking and wondering ... And a lot of this stuff focuses on the lack of certainty about the future, inability to make plans, etc. So, I am one week post mastectomy. Unlike most people here, at this stage of their treatment, I still have no real idea of my stage or grade and I really really want to know. All I know is that it is a mixed lobular and ductal cancer, probably multifocal with the 'main' tumour around 30mm. Thay said mixed cancers are usually grade 2 butthe inital biopsy didnt say one way or another but i am not sure why. I had the whole breast removed and a sentinel node biopsy. I've been told to expect chemo - in part because I am 35 (?). What I want to know right now is whether I will be able to work. I know it varies, but what can I expect? Without revealing my career, my job involves committing to a chunk of work with regular times lots on set days each week. I imagine that that kind of commitment isn Possible as I won't know from one week to the next how I will feel. I also gather that if don't react well, it's not the kind of sickness one can easily 'work through'. So, say if I get leave to miss the regular parts of my work - will I be able to work at all? Does anyone work freelance and find they can work from time to time? If I timed my work to happen in week two or three of each chemo cycle would that work? And how long is it all likely to last? If I started treatment during August, what are the chances of me being okay by January, february ...? I get that these are silly questions. I just have to sit and wait. But, today I am freaking out.",

It may well come back, but I'm learning quickly that for me at least, thoughts keep changing. This seems to go along with the scope of one's perspective - trying to fast forward and pre-empt certain events, versus just looking at the next step in front of you. I felt silly in my last appointment when asked if I'd read about the sentinal node biopsy. I'd skimmed the pamphlet but had spent most of my time reading about terminal cancer, chemotherapy, hair growth and so on - rather than the thing I actually should have been thinking about.",

I have been having hot flushes and sweats since week 3 of first FEC, but they've become far more frequent and regular since being on Tax. second tax worse than first. It is the chemos effect on hormones causing it - menopausal symptoms (though I am still having periods). one thing i have noted is that I dont seem to get the flushes when I have the low-grade temp, which I have had for a few hours nearly every day of this last cycle (37.5-7). If I flush, temp is normal. I dont know if that is coincidence? Tips for managing it involve avoiding triggers such as sudden changes in temperature, hot drinks and so on. pretty useless in practice, especially this time of year with the difference between inside and outside temps. I wear layers for quick 'cool downs', and brought a handheld fan off ebay for a couple of pounds. some people use a 'chillow' - something like an icepack for your pillow? ",
