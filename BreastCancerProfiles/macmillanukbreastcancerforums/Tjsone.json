      "Content": "Hi everyone and th am you so much for your replies......I\u2019m not sure on the pathology yet as I get the results of hormone receptors next week....the surgeon said that depending on those results will all depend on if he does surgery chemo radio biological treatments, in which particular order....so I guess I have to wait until next Thursday to find this out.......my story is this.....my sister who is 50 has got breast cancer and is being treated and having her surgery on the 23rd of this month.....I am three years older and decided that I will go and help to look after her and her family whilst she is recovering.....last week I had what I thought were cysts,,,, so my way of thinking was let\u2019s get these drained and sorted before I go up to Lincoln to look after her as I don\u2019t want to be moaning about heavy lumpy boobies after she has gone through her own breast surgery....she is a grade two and having full mastectomy, it\u2019s lobal invasive with lots of extra tumours in her breast...... So I go to mammo last week, yes they said, it is cysts but we think you also have breast cancer so let\u2019s do biopsies,,,,, comes back two days later, it\u2019s a grade three, surgery booked for three days after my sister....I am in Southampton.......and the irony of us being diagnosed at same time is just unbelievable! You couldn\u2019t write this sort of stuff on east Enders! Lol I have to have a senital node dye put in the day before surgery , not exactly looking forward to that procedure.....any advice on that? Xxxx...also so glad I have joined this group,,, it\u2019s actually been a great help xx. ",
