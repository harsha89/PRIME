    "Content": "I'm 40. Newly diagnosed breast cancer yesterday. I don't know what to do, where to go. Have number of hospital link nurse to phone later, but don't know what to ask or where to start. Had mammogram, two ultrasounds & biopsy yesterday & was told slightly bluntly that it is 99.9% cancer & to prepare to discuss treatment next week. Any help, words of wisdom greatly appreciated x",
