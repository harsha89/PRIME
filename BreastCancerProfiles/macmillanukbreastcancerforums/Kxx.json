    "Content": "What a good idea. When I went mastectomy bra shopping with my mum she felt self conscious enough without having to ask an assistant where she could find mastectomy bras. We were met time after time by the same response - you'll have to look online. I found this shocking and disgraceful at a time where women are encouraged to feel proud of their bodies and self confident. It is important that women can try on bras before purchasing and not feel shunned to the Internet. I have always thought there was a huge opportunity in this area. I would like to see attractive and practical mastectomy bras widely available in all lingerie departments at a reduced price perhaps with a donation to charity from each sale. Good luck with your quest and a message for your company - please do it and you have a valued employee there who is giving feedback on an issue affecting many women. Would you like to be on the shop floor and have to keep telling women you don't stock mastectomy bras? ThankyouÂ ",
