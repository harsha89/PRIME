      "Content": "Hi Baki I just wanted to say 'I know how you feel' I have a poor prognosis, <20% on reaching 10 years, 50/50 reaching 5, and I am on year 4. I feel like I am sitting in the waiting room, waiting  to be told its my turn to see the cancer cells again. I dont know how to not think like this and as time goes by (far too quickly) I get the thoughts more and more often. (A few months ago I was in a much better place emotionally) Thankfully my children are grown up (29 and 31) but still not settled in life and not a hope in hell of seeing any grandchildren from either of them as yet. I often wonder why I bother working so hard, or so much, with a good bit of pain (apart from financially, I am separated) as it just takes all my days away from me when I could spend my time doing things I love, which doesnt cause me terrible pain, unfortunately, its not to be. Living 'with' secondaries must feel much the same as this, cept you probably feel like you are in a different waiting room. My son took my diagnosis and treatment very hard, my mum also had/was treated/ and lost her battle against leukemia at the very same time, and he had a huge meltdown which I helped him through. I worry he will meltdown again if/when I have a recurrance. My daughter is rather more quiet and keeps a lot to herself even whilst we still live together. I worry she will take on board too much and not 'let it out'. I dont think there is any easy way for our children to accept whats happened/happening to us, its part of life, and everyone deals with it differently, including our friends. I find as time goes on, I seem to be ditching some 'friends' and keeping myself to myself, not sure if its a protecting mechanism or not (less people around, the less I can hurt) or if its a case of others 'roll eyes when I mention anything to do wth health' scenario, so I just dont mention it, preferring to only talk to a few 'closer' people and my children. Dont think this post is going to help you with your 'death sentence' feelings, I just wanted to let you know that many more of us think and feel the same Big hugs to you and your children X",

I had a 4 inch tumour, 14 positive lymph nodes. Mastectomy, chemo, rads, herceptin, tamoxifen, reconstruction and reduction. I will have my 3 year check up in a couple of months. Like you, at the beginning I was terrified, couldnt sleep, fell into depression, thought I was going to die, but hey, here i am, near 3 years out, all be it a bit battered and bruised, not the same person anymore, but still here, getting on with life from day to day just like before. Take comfort from all the ladies on here who are still here, living life, looking after kids, working, having fun, holidaying etc..... You will too XX",

I went back to work part time, still starting at 7am, on the 2nd Monday after that and have worked everyday throughout chemo and herceptin, only taking 3 weeks off during radiotherapy as that was a 70 mile trip. I have worked every single day and not had to have any days off sick. Its very doable although very tiring, but i would take a nap each day when got home from work. Hopefully your chemo will not knock you off your feet if you wish to return to work as I think it was the best thing for me to keep me occupied and to stop the mind going into overdrive. it was good to be around other people too.

I am on 14/18 treatments.  Triple positive is easier to treat than triple negative as everything gets thrown at it to try ensure it does not come back. Your ER+ will be treated with tamoxifen. I presume this will be after your chemotherapy if you are having. Am sure someone with much more info will be along to give you a better explanation but try not to worry or get too wrapped up in all the details until you are better able to take it all in. I understand your head being all over the place and it does get easier to cope with once treatment starts and you begin to understand what each one does. Its amazing how fast the time goes by once you get started and you will be around so many people who can answer your questions as you become more able to process the info.Don'tt despair, many many of us are going through it or coming out the other side and we are all a big club called HELP Best wishes",

      "Content": "Hi all Glad this subject has come up as I dont know what to do. I was only off for approx  2 months after a mx, i went back to work after my first chemo session and have worked part time since with only time off for appts. I used to work full time.For the last 6 months I have been asking to increase my hours from 20 to  30 (Ireally dont think I could do 40 yet as still having herceptin), however I feel I am being ignored. I have asked I dont know how many times with no concrete reply. I am single, live with just my daughter and I so need the money. Another female was employed to do 20 hours of my job when I was off and when I went back part time. She is still there and seems unless I do 40 hours she will STAY there.  My bosses are wonderful caring people, and were very supportive when I was diagnosed and I really do not want to start 'demanding' . I do know what my rights are but its such a difficult thing to bring up at work without sounding threatening. I am now on the waiting list for recon and will be off again for another 2 months. I need this issue to be resolved before then so I can slip back into work once I have recovered and not have to go thro this financial worry once I need to increase my hours again. Any suggestions gratefully received Thx Rhonda x",

Higher risk of BC in rt. Hence reg mammograms. Muga score down to 51 so now on ramipril. Liver suffering a bit as also on venlafaxine to try curb hourly hot flushes (its not helping).

Predict hasnt been updated in the last 10 years, i may be wrong though, and I am suspecting it was based around women of an older generation and their outcomes, well thats what am telling myself anyway !! haha Anyway, I have seen onc every  6 months in past 4 years, he asked how I would feel about leaving it a year before saw him again as majority of women get discharged and or are seen much less frequently, to which i gasped lol, I need my 6 monthly check up considering prognosis, so he soon backed down on that, however, as for my sore shoulder, he has booked me in for a bone scan and now wants to see me in 3 months!! Talk about a rollercoaster ride, like cancer is, I am now totally confused as to whether I am fine and can be seen in a year or not fine and need to see him in 3 months !!!! The one thing that he spoke about which has really lifted me, although I may sound a bit warped lol, is that no matter how many scans i have, no matter how many blood tests i have etc etc, it wont change anything, once diagnosed with a secondary, its incurable, full stop, and it doesnt matter when its diagnosed, whether caught early or not, it will be incurable, its a case of living WITH cancer after that. This has def put my busy mind to rest, as in no matter what my prognosis is as of now, if and when it comes back, its the same....so no point getting up each day and wonder ing if this is the day i find its back, cos nothing will change if I do. Hopefully my days will be much better now. and yours too R X",

With personal experience, I would ask to have my B12 levels checked as low B12 can also cause neuropathy. This has many symptoms and not strictly pins and needles like a lot of information states. Also as a double whammy, chemo can cause low B12. I have tired aching legs, incredibly sore feet along with pins and needles, burning sensation and lots of other symptoms and have just been diagnosed with a deficiency in B12 after all this time (over 2 years post chemo) If you dont ask for something to be checked, it probably wont get checked. Try visiting the Pernicious Anaemia Society website where it lists all the symptoms of neuropathy, if it doesnt fit with your symptoms then least you can have something ruled out Hope you find the answers you need take care",

I have suddenly developed an allergy to dust ( i think), as every time i try to hoover i end p with eyes that feel like grit has been thrown in them. Also, more obscure...something that is in frozen chips, makes my nose itch whilst I am eating, and most bizarre is a reaction to my shampoo and conditioner which makes me tear the skin off my hands as so itchy. I am 2 years from chemo and can only suspect that the chemo benefits are wearing off and body trying to get back to some kind of normality. I think this because for first time in 2 years I have actually got body odour ie armpit, just in one tho.not the cancer side. Is this all relative, or am I being too focused on blaming everything on chemo when I may have developed allergies anyway??? Do I need to be talking to onc to make sure my immune system is not weak because of something else going on ie cancer anywhere else EEKKK, freaking a bit, just like first diagnosis!!",

I have also got neuropathy, dunno bout you yet, but prior to each flush i (used) to get a butterfly like feeling in my tummy, now, with the neuropathy that feeling is now 'zapping' nerves, like electric shocks, this wakes me up before the flush starts, but even prior to the zapping, i shiver first, for around 10/15 mins, then its the zapping, then its the flush. I too started flushing very soon after starting tamoxifen, and it has never got better, just worse, if i exert myself at all, even a wee bit, like packing shopping in supermarket, or sandpapering a door, or maybe just wiping down in kitchen, it sets off a hot flush. Cant say i have noticed any diff by not having hot drinks or hot food (oh each meal time brings on a flush, meaning have to leave my food for 10 mins til cool down), avoiding alcohol def helps, but usually only have red wine on a friday night.  wearing cotton clothes makes no diff, sleeping with bedroom window open or closed makes no diff, in fact I couls stand outside in a snowstorm and still have a hot flush. Sorry I have nothing positive to tell you whatsoever cept some women say it gets better for them after a while and changing brands seems to help others but hopefully you might find some trigger points now that I have pointed out some of mine. I will def look at the acupuncture treatment if I get told I really HAVE to stay on taoxifen I hope your journey is not as bad and that you are one of the lucky ones and it gets better. I will try and remember you Blue, easy name) and let you know what onco says when i see him on 23rd X take care",

      "Content": "Hi Hally I took clonidine for a good while, it maybe took a slight edge off but didnt make any difference to the amount of flushes I was having. I also took venlafaxine, an anti depressant, at 150mg daily, which is supposed to help also, for me it didnt and stopped that after a year. I didnt see the point in using all these chemicals to make hardly any change in how I was feeling. The venlafaine also hid the fact I have neuropathy as its an anti immflamatory drug also, getting treatment for such now, but nerve damage is probably much worse than if it had been dx sooner. This past week I have started taking a magnessium supplement, and can honestly say I am getting a much better sleep, and getting a good 5 hours sleep without the flushes or shivers waking me. Think we are pretty limited in what herbal remedies we can take but as they cant be prescribed then its costly and takes a few months to discover if there is any benefit. I have stopped my Tamoxifen for now as due to have blood tests to see if past menopause, if I am not, I am not going back on it, its too much and debilitating, have ran my life around them, eg can only hoover one room at a time, one little bit of weeding at a time etc as any exertion makes them worse. Pleased to hear you are getting relief though with clonidine, I knew another lady who also had good results with it, and hope other ladies in this thread read about it and maybe it will help them also Thx for replying Rhonda",

On keeping a diary I am having around 30 in a day, including overnight averaging every 35/40 mins. Is this a normal amount to have? How many do other ladies have? I really am thinking about quitting the drugs altogether, do I have an option to have ovaries removed to stop my hormones? Have got an onc appt later next month, but would like to hear what others are suffering and be armed with some info before my appt Many thx",

Granite Grit, its available on Amazon as ebook and paperback The cover has boxing gloves but its not really about boxing but about one family mans struggle with his past. My son, Lee, wrote the book after he had been in a bit of a bad place when I was having treatment for my breast cancer and his gran (my mum) lost her battle to leukemia at the same time. He said writing helped focus his mind away from the turmoil he was in with both of us being ill at the same time. Hope you dont mind my plug Thx X",

      "Content": "Hi Julie I am with you 100%, I have a hot flush every 35 minutes, 24 hours a day. Are you on tamoxifen? Is that what has caused your flushes? I tried Clonidine and it only helped a little overnight but not enough to justify taking another drug on top of everything else. I also tried acupuncture which didnt help at all. As for your citalipram, if you are on Tamoxifen I would be checking with gp/onc if its safe for you to take as some anti depressants affect Tamoxifen. Venlafaxine as an anti depressant has been recommended as good for hot flushes and is safest to take with Tam, although I tried it also to no avail. ( I have recently been given Cymbalta from gp which I have also found out can affect Tam and will be speaking to onc next week about it) As for ideas to help you out I am afraid I havent found anything to lessen hot flushes, I can only be permanately prepared with electric fans. I have one at work, one on coffee table at home and one in bedroom attached to my headboard which I use during the night. I also have a usb one that i use with laptop. You can purchase 'cooling scarves' from Amazon which have good reviews but I have not tried one. Small ice packs can help if you are at home, like when you are in the kitchen cooking and can pull one out of the freezer at a seconds notice and then pop it back in again. The one and only thing that gives me a few hours relief is a sleeping pill, I manage to nod off and sleep ok for around 4/5 hours before the flushes start to wake me up again. Neither my onc or gp have any solutions Sorry I cant give you a cure.........I would be a millionaire if I found one Rhonds X",
