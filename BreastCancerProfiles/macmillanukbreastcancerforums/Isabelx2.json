    "Content": "Dear Tina, Try to smile, even if you don't feel like it. It will still radiate positive energy out and in! And you'll feel it when your child or husband smiles back..they will give you the energy. And 40 is only one year more than 39... (I am 46)It does not change more than from 38 to 39!! Good luck,Isabel",
