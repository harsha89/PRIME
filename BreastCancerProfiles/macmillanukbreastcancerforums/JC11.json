      "Content": "Hi All, I haven't posted on here before but have been a lurker since diagnosed in March and found the posts, questions, answers and advice very helpful. . I had an lumpectomy back in April with SNB which showed node involvement so had a auxiliary clearance in May started First FEC in June which kept me on the sofa with sicky feeling and exhaustion for around 5 days. The thing is I had my second FEC last Friday the sickness was better due to different tablets but the headaches have been unbearable, on top of my head and across my forehead, eyes like the light is to bright. Also been having trouble focusing, reading or looking at TV for too long :( Does seem a bit better today but is a week now anyone else had this ? Been taking paracetamol and wearing my shades to reduce light but getting fed up now. Any advice? Thanks Janet",
