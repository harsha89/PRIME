    "Content": "Hope you're feeling better today. On 6 th day after first dose of tax after 3 FEC and its been hell - I've cried too...lots - no sleep for the pain and have upped dose of paracetamol plus ibuprofen after talking to nurse today. It has eased to some extent today and my lovely nurse assured me it would get better!! Already dreading next one though! But as I have to tell myself......it's my enemy at the moment but will end up my friend. Hang in there!",
