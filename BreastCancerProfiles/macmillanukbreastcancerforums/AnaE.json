    "Content": "It is good to read about the successful DIEP reconstructions on this thread. Mine (if I get one) will be delayed but I don't suppose this makes any difference to discomfort/recovery times. What I would specifically like to know is whether anybody had any 'dog ear' type 'extras' either side of their abdomen after the surgery. I am rather worried about this as I have such a 'dog ear' on the side where I had the mastectomy - hopefully this can be incorporated into the DIEP. Also, I have met one woman who had the DIEP who told me that she did have 'dog ears' either side but that these were removed during later surgery (she was private - not so sure this would be available on the NHS). The other things I would like to know are:Â  1. How soon could you go up the stairs? I have an upstairs bedroom and downstairs bathroom and would want to keep the up and down business to a minimum. There is a chance I could have a put-down bed in the front room but this is rather low and I'm wondering whether this would make it difficult to get up and down. (I find it quite difficult due to my knees to get up and down at the best of times.) 2. Did you have somebody around for a good few weeks after the surgery? From what I have read here one could be out of hospital as soon as three days after the surgery. My sister would come up to help for two or three days after this. Other than that I will be on my own. I'd need to be able to answer the door at the very least if I was to get friends/paid help in to assist. Does this sound workable? Thank you. P.S. I am getting anxious now (even though nothing has actually been promised) especially as I initially had an implant but got an infection and this had to be removed. I am scared of getting an infection through the DIEP and all going wrong. I don't know how I got the infection of course but I needed to keep my drain in for 13 days because the bottle kept filling beyond a certain point. It seems as though you all only had your drains for three or so days (at least in the posts I have read).",
