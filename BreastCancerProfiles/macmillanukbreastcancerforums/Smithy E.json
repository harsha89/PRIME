      "Content": "Hi, My children are 13 and 16 and I agree with what everyone has said. they sense when something is wrong and it is better they know facts than fill in the blanks themselves, probably with much scarier scenarios. I told mine I had cancer and said they cold ask whatever they wanted to know at any time. I found they did this to their own comfort level when they were ready to hear the information. My 16 year old daughter asked a lot but my 13 year old son has taken more time and asked questions at a slower rate.  Whatever you decide trust your own instincts as their Mum, they are sure to be right.  Good luck xx",

I had my masectomy 2 and a half weeks ago and said to my bcn even before I left hospital that I though my tummy must be filling up with fluid as it seemed so big and wobbly.  She didn't think so so I decided it was just fat but it definitely seems to be gradually returning to normal now - hope yours does too",

      "Content": "Hi Shaz   my diagnosis was very similar to yours, grade 2, 11cm tumour and needing both chemo and radiotherapy.  I also remember what an impossible decision it was. I met with the pastic surgeon to discuss what he felt was best and he strongly advised waiting due to affect the radio would have on the reconstruction and probably needing re-doing afterwards. It made me feel really down for a while as I didn't like the thought of waking up with nothing there and I think I had not completely accepted this which is why I was so keen for a reconstruction straight away.  Have you been able to meet with the plastic surgeon to discuss the possibilities for you? This is what really helped me and reduced all those decisions. good luck whatever you decide Liz x",
