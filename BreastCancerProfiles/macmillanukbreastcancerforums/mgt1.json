      "Content": "Hi Kim, I wondered how you were feeling today. I had my second lot of Docetaxel on Wednesday and, up to now, I am feeling OK. I kept some short notes about my first lot and I did not really go 'down hill' until the Saturday afternoon - i.e. 3days after the infusion. I found the side effects much worse than the FEC but we all react differently and I suggest you may wish to keep a brief diary of how you are on each day. At least that way you can plan your life around the next bash !!! I also had 'the runs' and found Dioralyte great. It was also something that had some taste when everything else, including water, tasted like feathers (not that I have indulged in eating feathers before it just felt like that !!!!). PLEASE, if your symptoms get very bad, contact your doctor or oncology nurse...they have loads of stuff in their pharmacies to help you. They just need to know the problems you are facing. Frequent bland foods are also very good but don't eat Grapefruit as it will make your symptoms worse. I have been told this my my sister who is an oncology nurse but not by my own oncologist. I have taken heed...it is up to you whether you want to or not. (My sis is rather clever but I don't tell her so very often !!!) Good luck over the next week or so. I shall be there with you and I am certain we can support each other. Best regards,",
