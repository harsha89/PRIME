    "Content": "I used the scalp cooler for the first session of 6 chemo's, I found it extremely uncomfortable, I did bear with it ,but did not bother with it after that. I am just about to have chemo 5, and I still have some hair, it is very fine and downy, but it covers my scalp. Most of it is my fringe which frames my face with my baker boy hat on, and a covering at the back, which I curl to make it look thicker. I would not go out without a hat on, but have not had the need for a wig or scarves. There are no guarantees with the cooler, the ratio is 70/30 %, you may be one of the luckier ones. If you do lose your hair, put a bit more makeup on, to show up your features more, even if you lose your eyelashes, you can still frame your eyes with lovely colour eyeshadows, its important that you feel confident and a little bit more glamerous at a time like this. A brightly coloured scarf around your neck can also give you a lift. Good luck my friend, hold your head up, walk proud and tall, after all, if you do lose it, your hair will grow back.
