      "Content": "Hi Ross and Jo, It is such a hard decision to make, but in saying that we are so very lucky in this day and age for the options that are on offer. All I can say is get all the info required for these 2 different procedures and go with what Jo feels makes sense to her. I had a mastectomy and reconstruction all at once on the 23rd December 09 I was big breasted so I chose to have an expander implant reconstruction and had my good breast reduced to match the implant. I am very happy with my choice, I was out of hospital the very next day and was up and about a few days later. For me that was the decider on what option to take, I did not want to be in hospital long and the recovery time was quicker. Just regarding an implant and radiotherapy I too was worried as I had heard the implant could get hard and distorted, I finished 5 weeks of daily radiation on 10th September and I am happy to say my implant is fine :-) Radiation Therapy is for a direct hit to the affected area, having both chemo and radio has given me peace of mind knowing I have thrown everything I can at this disease to be rid of it!! Sending you lots of love and strength Maree xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I only have one week left of my taxol treatment, then I have to start taking Tamoxifen as my breast cancer was hormone receptive. I have been looking up different websites about tamoxifen and it sounds like there is more cons than pros obvioulsy the main pro keeping a recurrance at bay. I am only 43 and would like to live a fairly normal life without any major side affects. Can anybody let me know of their experiences with Tamoxifen and if there are ladies out there who chose not to take it? Maree xx",
