The dosage on her box is 1500mg / 400iu and her prescription has always been for one chewable tablet twice a day, so maybe yours should have been a total of two a day as well ? They do come in different strengths and some are chewable or can just be standard tablets so if yours are the same 1500 / 400 two tablets shouldn't do any harm, but to confirm this is if you have doubts phone your GP and check. Hope this helps, G n' J",

      "Content": "Afternoon OMG,  Sorry to see you here in the club no-one wants to join. Best thing is when you go in tomorrow ask if it's possible you could have some lymph fluid build up as your arm doesn't feel right to you. They will soon check it out and even if you have, be very doubtful it will make surgery a problem. Assume by removing breast lump you are talking about a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy ? Fingers crossed they will get what they call clear margins which means they get all the cancer and a small clear area around it, if they find from histology they haven't they may have you in again to take a little more until it is \"clear\"  Don't fret if this happens as it is quite common. It's a fine line between taking too little tissue from the breast to leave you with some boob and taking too much and making you lopsided and mis-shaped.  As for not knowing how many nodes, have you heard them mention anything like sentinel node where they take from one up to four nodes and check to see how many could be affected or a \"clearance\" where they take most if not all of them ? It is nearly always a sentinel node check first  if one or two are affected, they will take more but rarely take all of them first time around unless they already know from biopsies etc. Again, do ask, don't be kept in the dark about any of your treatments ( surgery, chemo or rads and anything else for that matter ) You can deal with it so much better if you know what they are doing and what is going on. You will have to wait around 10 days for the results on grading and stage from histology dept who will examine the tissue removed , also if you are hormone positive ( tumour feeding off your own hormones ) Which will dictate wether you get Herceptin and/or any hormone based tablets like Tamoxifen or Letrozole later on. Try not to worry too much while waiting for results (hard we know) and do keep firing questions at us as we only have until tomorrow to answer them before your surgery. Also have you been given plenty of booklets to read up on breast cancer and treatments ? as they are available as free downloads on this website. If you need more info just holler and we'll point you too them. Take care,  George & Jackie.",

You may have been signed off as Herceptin isn't a chemo drug it's what they call an monoclonal antibody targetted therapy. Either way you surely were given follow up appointments with the onco ? as he / she is the one who can refer you for a dexa. If you don't have one they are clueless to any bone thinning the tamoxifen may cause. If you have an appt coming up ask about a dexa scan then, if not get in contact and ask if they plan giving you one. I don't know if a GP can refer you for a dexa scan, maybe worth asking if you have a helpful GP ? Ten years is a long time if this bone thinning happens and during that time you could have been taking tablet to lessen this. The Breast Cancer Care site has this info page about tamoxifen and osteo problems. Mentions Tamoxifen about half way down the page. There is this too - Osteopenia Decreased bone mineral density (a measurement of bone strength) but not low enough to be diagnosed as osteoporosis. Osteopenia. See also Dexa scan link to NHS.

      "Content": "Winter  must be coming, another Blue Tit has appeared. Seriously though Dawn hope you are feeling ok this morning apart from feeling sore after your WLE. When they inject the blue dye they are looking to see how many sentinel nodes you have ( sentinel meaning being the nearest ones to where the breast fluid drains to ) obviously from the dye marker you have just the one, some people can have up to four sentinels out of from 12 to over 20 nodes. So they only take the dyed ones. Because you are grade one as you said they are not expecting to find it infected but they have to be certain as it affects further treatment. If it does come back clear great, but if it doesn't then they will have you back and take some more and check those out. The more they take the more chance of lymphoedema as the fluid has to go somewhere so they don't take more than they feel they need to at the start. Jackie's was 8 mm grade 3 and she had 3 sentinels removed during MX which luckily came back clear and she had only very minor probs with lymphoedema. They will probably also include \"zapping\" the lymph area during any future radiotherapy treatment. I'll put in a link to the Maccy SLNB webpage incase you haven't read it.

Know a lot of advice while on chemo is to sleep when you need to, but if you rest up too much during the day (if possible on steroids lol ) you won't need so much during the night.

Think a lot of the confusion is in the term GP (General Practitioner) they generalise, and a lot of the time they cannot be 'arsed' or won't spare the time to look stuff up.  It's ok for them they aren't the ones getting the side effects :-( I would have another go at chasing one up either through a gp or maybe even your onco team.

So if a recon is on the cards it may be the implant and/or expander type. You could have a look here at Keeping Abreast uk which is a breast reconstruction support site. I'm afraid you probably won't find out about needing chemo for sure until the removed tissue pathology results come through about a week after surgery - that is where they get most of the final diagnosis and treatment pointers from. Don't fear the answers from questions as no amount of worrying will alter the outcome - it's better knowing even if scary than not asking and forever worrying about every thought that pops up. Because of your family history has anything been mentioned to you about taking the BRCA gene test ? as you sound like a prime candidate for it, so it would be worth asking about this as it takes a couple of months to get the results through. It's not only breast cancer that has brca gene links, but it also can include family history of ovarian in women and prostate cancer in male relatives.

If it continues to cause you discomfort see if they can give you something to help also keep an eye on it for any increasing redness that could be a sign of infection. Stitches can also fail ( a common problem with those who try to do too much too soon after the op) so make the most of getting plenty of rest for a few days.

When you say come back do you mean local recurrence in the same area (same breast if you had a lumpectomy for instance) or secondaries elsewhere in the body, mastectomy site or the other breast ? Within the first couple of months post treatment In normal cases you can be fairly sure you are safe, but as usual there are loads of exceptions which can make this possible :-( Some types of BC are more aggressive than others (Inflammatory and Triple Negative for example)  sometimes a few cells can be missed during surgery, in the breast if clear margins are not obtained, or any that remain in the lymph nodes - single cells are not usually a problem because they either get zapped by chemo, rads or tablets, or your own immune system, but if they are in a cluster somewhere and go unaffected and unnoticed things can get scary....

Not everyone gets this in a severe way, but joint and muscle aches are one of the more common side effect of docetaxel/taxotere - although some can find it painful just climbing stairs. If this starts getting a bit too much let your onco unit know about this and they will either advise some form of pain relief and possibly reduce the dosage by 20% next time around. Do check out the September Chemo Discussion (link) and get chatting to others going through similar treatments to share the chemo baggage. Hope it eases off soon, G n' J",

Doctors will always say the main drug is the same, and it is, but some of the fillers and coatings used vary greatly. Fingers crossed your treatment pains ease and your lump checks out ok.

      "Content": "Hi HelenM17 This was the case up to the introduction of Herceptin trials pre 2010 as Grade 3 HER2+ Positive was just about the most agressive type of breast cancer to be diagnosed with and a very poor prognosis; it was known as 'the widowmaker' because of the much higher risk of mets -  It may have taken a while but for a lot of patients the mets were just to severe in the end :( Since the introduction of Herceptin and the newer Perjeta (also other newer drugs on the very cusp of being made available) these are game changers for HER2+ cancers and is now no longer seen as a death sentence even for those with invasive HER2+ BC That is why when those with HER2+ post as new members asking about not having chemo makes me shudder, because without the chemo they don't get the good stuff  :-/ For some even with the newer drugs regime it just doesn't work out and can come back as a secondary somewhere but the chances of that now is a lot less. If this is what happened with your friend has she has been very unlucky or hers was found late and more advanced ? J was diagnosed with HER2+ (ER/PR+ positive too) in May 2012 when Herceptin was a still postcode lottery drug and her onco said if we were in the next county she wouldn't have got it - Luckily just after that NICE approved funding it for everyone, but even now it is still £1,300 per dose.... As for the last comment, nearly everyone would never say you are 'cured' as there isn't the technology yet to find single cancer cells within the body but they will class you as NED - No Evidence of Disease which is as good as it gets.

Think she suffered just about every side effect going and a few free ones on top. Luckily her feet/hand probs were peripheral neuropathy not PP which is evil, it's all you can do to walk anywhere as just putting your weight on your feet is so painful. Have a word with your onco unit and/or GP and ask about Pyridoxine tablets they have been prescribed for others here who have had palmar plantar and taken throughout chemo. Another great help is Udder Cream originally formulated for care of cows teats - well you imagine being topless outside in all weathers. You can buy these from Amazon - Proper Udder Cream seems to be better than the Udderly Smooth one which has a slight scent but it's a tad greasy and doesn't readily absorb as 'real' udder cream does. Use it on hands and feet. If you are lucky you may even be able to get it prescribed, if not Just go to amazon and put udder cream in the search box, there are loads of dif types. They may reduce the dose of your other T by 20% that may help take the edge off the side effects without compromising it's good work meanwhile don't suffer in silence, make sure they know how rough you are feeling and don't accept you have to put up with this discomfort. Hope you get to feel a bit better in the next few days Take care Kath, George & Jackie",

From what we see in the group at least half of those having chemo will suffer some symptoms of PN and being nerve related it is not only numbness and tingling it can also get painful, or feel very hot like your feet are burning - This can go on for quite a while after chemo too. PN can also go on to become what they term Palmar Plantar which is Hand / Foot syndrome where the skin can actually blister and crack making walking almost impossible. Please read this old post about hand foot syndrome it could help you if your  hands and/or feet get painful. Although the symptoms do ease off quite a bit PN can leave you with permanent slight numbness. Jackie finished her chemo in October 2012 and still has some numbness in her big toes.

It was then de-licensed and around 6 other companies now make it. The drug Letrozole itself is the correct dosage but the fillers to make up the tablet size and the coatings can vary between makes.  This is what causes the variations in side effects of those taking it. If on your repeat prescription it says Femara that should be what you get, but if it says Letrozole you could get it by any maker. If that is the case and you are getting different makes from your pharmacy it may pay you to make notes of the makes and how you feel while taking them, then you can try to only get the makes that agree with you. Femara still make letrozole but they are the most expensive that is why usually you get a one of the other makes like Teva, Sandoz, Accord, Rambaxy etc Oh, and any of these hormone inhibitor tablets (letrozole, tamoxifen, arimidex etc) can cause a bit of weight gain but not everyone is affected by this ?

Sometimes they feel like sharp stabbing twinges, nips, or little electric shocks they will fade but it can take a while. Do keep up your physio excercises although painful they will help and the sooner you ease the tension the more arm shoulder mobility you will have. Keep an eye out for any signs of Lymphoedema after they remove your drain as it can be a problem after a complete clearance because you now have no nodes to clear away any lymph fluid so it has to find another route. Just click the green link for a bit more info. If you have any other concerns or questions don't hesitate in posting a New Discussion we're all here to help each other through this. Take care, George & Jackie",

It's something you see mentioned quite a lot in either of the Incurable Groups. The one thing above all else in their attitude to being classed as incurable is that they will tell you they are \"Living With Cancer, not dying from it\" The glass half full way of looking at this opens up a whole new way of thinking about how you cope with making the most out of the future you still have. there is no reason why you couldn't still be enjoying a reasonable life for years to come. While there is still treatment for you there is still hope this can buy you lots of time -  Fingers crossed you can turn this around and start enjoying what you still have, rather than beating yourself up over something that was totally out of your control. {{Group Hugs}}  G n' J",

Just to let you both know how you are feeling is totally normal - we were all rabbits in the headlights when you first get the shock diagnosis. You have got through the agonising wait for results and have a treatment plan set out it's getting to grips with all the questions you must have regarding surgery, tissue histology for grading etc You wife seems to have fantastic attitude to all this, underneath she must be wondering what the hell is happening but accepting what has to be done to get through all this. It may get to her a bit, so be prepared for the odd angry outburst and teary sessions she may have concerns for how you may feel after surgery towards her altered body shape, just help wherever you can and be her rock even though you may be falling to bits too. Like me you probably won't notice too much, but it comes as a helluva shock when she first sees the breast missing. They are a great bunch here and will help you both as much as pos, so post as often as you like. Do either of you have any specific questions gnawing away at the moment ? With surgery coming up if you have answers it will help ease your concerns. My wife (Jackie) had a left mastectomy (grade 3) , chemo, herceptin and radiotherapy and we're well over a year out the other side of the treatment tunnel. Just one thing please don't google stuff, a lot of the info is either way out of date, or wrong and really scares the crap out of you, when in reality breast cancer treatment has come on in leaps and bounds over the last couple of years.

      "Content": "Morning Louise  / Loulou1007  The most common chemo regime for BC was FEC-T 3 or 4 cycles of each. A lot of oncologists started dropping the F part as it was causing more problems than benefits, leaving it called EC. Nice recommends for breast cancer an anthracycline has to be given with any chemo regime which means they have to use either Epribubicin, the E part of FEC or Doxorubicin (also called adriamycin hence the A) So it's mostly EC or AC now followed by T (a taxane)  if needed. Why an oncologist chooses one over the other I have no idea (perhaps one is kinder to the heart or liver ?) but both A and E are similar drugs with the same outcome. The C part is the same in both and is Cyclophosphamide. You can check out AC Chemo clicking here. Don't forget the October Chemo Club is here if you have any questions about it once you start. Colds rarely have any effect on postponing chemo, a chest infection may be a different case though. Take care, G n' J",

Wake up some mornings and have to hobble about for 5 mins to get your joints working, feel like you aged twenty years overnight some days, it's even painful to just turn over in bed on occasions ? Jackie has been on Letrozole (femara) for about 18 months now and although the side effects evened out at around 6 months they haven't eased much since. She is taking nsaids ( meloxicam) 15 mg but as you say it's a no,no if you are on warfarin etc. I have no idea if there is an alternative for those that are on blood thinners ? Out of curiosity have you had a quick DEXA scan for checking bone density, after J had that she was given AdCal and Alendronic acid tabs to take to counter some of the effects of the oestrogen stripping from the Letrozole as it has caused her to become osteopenic which has helped a bit with the bone pain. Do make a note of which maker name of Letrozole you are being given (pharmacy's are buggers for always getting the cheapest at the time) and  swapping them around. Different makers use different fillers to bulk up the tablet size and sometimes it's these fillers that can cause problems. If you happen to get given any that appear to be less of a problem see if you can always just have that make.....  The hot flushes etc should ease off after a while, but do get help with any side effects, you are on these for 5 years so don't be a martyr, sometimes you just have to shout a bit :-)  Hope this helps, they certainly don't make recovery easy for you, do they.

It's only natural now you have set the wheels in motion you just want to get this agonising wait over with and have some answers, but unfortunately at the start waiting is all you seem to be doing and it is a terrible time on the emotions. Hopefully you will get your letter in the next couple of days and you will have new worries to focus on - the fear of the unknown about what they will do to you at the breast clinic and then another wait for those results. It is all very new and scary for you but you are among friends here who know how you are and how frightened you must be. If you haven't heard anything by Monday (doubtful they will keep you waiting much longer) do phone and ask as they may have contacted your GP before you. As for being brave, it is just a case of getting on with kicking cancer where it hurts and trying to keep some control and normality going on. Our lives revolve around the calendar and the many appointments that never seem to end but at least we already have that, you at the moment have nothing but too much time to wait and worry. There is a word for what you are feeling - we know it as Scanxiety and it is thought of as a worse time than being on treatments. What you are feeling is totally normal but do hope for the best.

I would try to speak to your GP and ask if the information about you finding a new lump and having a swollen armpit on the other side needs to be added to the referral notes she sent to the breast screening clinic ? Do mention this at your breast clinic appointment as well so they can check out 'both' sides. It is unusual to have breast cancer discovered in both breasts at the same time but not unheard of. Hopefully because it seems you have issues in both this is something like fibroids which is a lot more common. You can have  read of Understanding Breast Screening here (link)  - You can probably expect ultrasound scans and if anything out of the ordinary is visible on screen biopsies using a hollow needle are taken for further examination. In some clinics they can give you results fairly quickly but most you have to return to a week later for the results. Do make sure you take someone with you to chat to and take your mind off it a little - they can also support you if you get the impression something isn't right too. You are into a tough emotional waiting time now and all the 'what if's' can get to you, do keep posting here with any questions or if you just want to have a chat.

Buy fruit and veg when they are 'in season' so they actually have some flavour (had enough of tasteless foods during the chemo weeks) If you feel you would like to cut out, or cut down of white flour products that is fine too. Eat what you like, when you like - everything in moderation and variation :-) Try not to use diet as a means of gaining some control back in your lives as it can become a bit of a obsession (some even taking it to extremes) and don't have too many plant and chemical based therapies. Especially if they have no proven long term track record concerning collateral damage. One or two supplements that you have proved helps you with side effects of hormone tablets etc is fine but be aware if you get hooked on taking more various types of supplements it can deplete your bank account quicker than you can say Holland & Barrett :-) Now where did I put those cripsy rolls and bacon :-) G n' J",

Normally IBC feels warm / hot but not in every case, and mostly there are no lumps to feel or see on mammograms - time to be pro-active - for your sanity you need answers. Hopefully it isn't inflammatory, but you need it ruling out because as you say IBC is aggressive. You have probably already read it but here's the Mac link to IBC in case you haven't. Fingers crossed, G n' J",

You will wake up one morning fingers crossed soon and it will be like a fog has lifted. Until then just go with it and rest as much as you need to. For most it is amazing how quickly you go from feeling like a zombie to I woke up and feel so much better today.... it just seems to drag on because the side effects kick in later. As far as appetite goes eat little and often if your taste buds have gone awol try spicing things up a bit, if everything just tastes yucky go for a bland diet and If you get that metallic taste try eating with plastic cutlery it helps a little - It's a devil trying to cut meat though :-) Hope you are feeling better soon, hugs G n' J",

It can feel quite weird at times and the feelings can change a bit from pins and needles to hot / cold, little zaps, even wet ? It does ease off as they gradually heal but may always feel very slightly numb. A lot of ladies will tell you node clearance is more painful than the breast surgery. Node clearance can be quite deep and it's a very sensitive area with lots of muscles and tendons for the arm / shoulder in. Good luck for a quick recovery from the surgery and the infection but do keep a check on it for fluid build up now the drain is out as the fluid has to find others routes to flow now a lot of the nodes have been taken out.  Have you had your post surgery pathology results yet ? Oh, and don't hesitate creating a New Discussion if you have any specific questions or concerns, we're all here to help :) Are you a kiwi in the land of the long white cloud, or you in the UK ?

You can find all you need to know about Understanding Breast Clinic Screening clicking here. Very few hospitals unless they run a 'one stop shop' will give you much information on the first visit, they may say you have something suspicious showing on the ultrasound screen that they need to take needle biopsy samples of and that could possibly be from the breast and/or a lymph node, they usually call you back around 10 days later for the results - so another agonising waiting period :-( It usually takes around an hour, but if the unit is busy may take a little longer.

So sorry to read about the worries with your wife and seeing you joining us here :( I don't want to alarm you any more than you already are but an inverted nipple was my wife's only symptom :( and she was diagnosed with breast cancer - it was only 8m/m and right behind the nipple and too small to feel.   OK, that is not what you wanted to hear but... That was over 5 years ago and she is thankfully still here and finding me jobs and decorating to do. Fingers crossed this is something like scar tissue from her previous surgery pulling it in, but if your fears are confirmed the treatments have improved greatly over the last 10 years so please put away these worries you may lose her. Obviously we would all prefer you both don't have to go down this road again but unless it is very advanced (which sounds doubtful) this may well be treated as recurrence and not secondary cancer. Keep chatting to us here and asking any questions you have until you know where this is going. Take care, G n' J",

Most of your oestrogen is produced by the ovaries so by being post meno they will be producing very little if any oestrogen now, but the Adrenal glands also make a little oestrogen and a small amount is also made from your bodies fat cells so this is all you will be producing. If this is still a concern for you ask to see a dietician as I think some foods can increase oestrogen production. If you can find out which, you can change your diet to avoid these. I'm not very well 'up' on this so do please check it all out with your onco unit. After all, they said no, so they should have some alternatives ideas to fall back on ? As for re-assurance about it not coming back, unfortunately after being bitten once none of us can have that luxury I'm afraid - we just plod on and hope for the best. A lot of the triple negative ladies don't get offered herceptin or any hormone tablets but mostly seem to be fine. Hope this is of some help, G n' J",

The most obvious one being hair follicles and good mouth/oral anti-bodies. Most will know about the white cell count being lowered but the red cell count takes a big dip too. Meaning not so many red cells to carry oxygen around your body, which in turn makes your heart work harder - result feeling breathless and shattered a lot more easily :( It's all a bit pants - G n' J Christmas Wishes.",

It's easy to get BCC and BC-org mixed up but treatment in the usa can vary a lot compared to what is given here. This is all very new, scary and a sharp learning curve for you at the moment. Treatment for BC has come a long way even over the last few years and it has one of the highest recovery rates (currently around 90%) There are a lot of members here who are years past treatment and stick around to help those newly diagnosed to hopefully ease your worries and provide honest answers.

Chemo, Herceptin (targeted therapy) Radiotherapy and 5 years of tablets, which she is just over halfway through. We were exactly the same as you at the start, fearful for the future and our world seemed to be imploding. You can't live like that so after the dust settles and you get your treatment plan it all becomes so much clearer and you can get on with 'stuff' a lot better. She had her 3 year review a couple of months back, the results came back 'No Evidence of Disease'  Woo-Hoo! There's no easy way about it, the treatment can be physically and emotionally tough at times but you get there, mainly because you have to, but once the results are in and they take the brakes off your life revolves around appointments for just about everything the time goes very quickly. You get off the Runaway Mine Cart Ride battered and bruised but back into the sunshine and living the new normal. Take it all one step at a time and with the support of your family and this lovely bunch of misfits, you'll do just fine :-) A good sense of humour is needed as much as a positive attitude (whatever that really means) you will see from some of the posts here, we all seem as mad as a box of frogs but it helps deal with the treatment baggage.

Macmillan have an info page about it - I'll paste the link in at the bottom. Have you mentioned it to your onco team ? as I'm sure they will offer some help. Jackie had this also in fingers and toes it gradually inproved but takes a while post chemo for the nerve damage to repair itself. Finished chemo way back in Nov and only her big toes still have a very minor numbness. She did lose all 20 nails though, so perhaps hers were worse affected than yours are They were persistent about being careful regarding nerve damage as it may lead to burning your fingers / hands if you cannot feel how hot things really are like hot tap water, getting things from hot ovens etc Hope the link helps, if it's not clickable just copy paste it into your browser.   http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Livingwithandaftercancer/Lifeaftercancer/Lateeffectsbreast/Possiblelateeffects/Peripheralneuropathy.aspx Best wishes,  George & Jackie. ",

The differences are TNM (is for stage) and TPM (is used for grade) TNM is used to describe the STAGE of cancer. T stands for tumour N for node involvement M for metastases However, the GRADE is defined by using TPM. Tubule Formation = T Nuclear Pleomorphism = P Mitosis Count = M That's about the description of the cells and how much they look different to normal body cells. Each category is scored 1, 2 or 3. Tubule Formation (% of Carcinoma composed of tubular structures like a normal cell) Score: over 75%  = 1 10-75%  = 2 less than 10%  = 3 Pleomorphism (Change in cells)  Score: Small, uniform cells  = 1 Moderate increase in size and variation  = 2 Marked variation  = 3 Mitosis Count (Cell division)  Score Totals: Up to 7  = 1 8 to 14  = 2 15 or more  = 3 Add the three scores together TPM - If you score 8 or 9 you are classed as Grade 3 6 or 7 is grade 2 Yours adds up to 2+2+1 = 5 so that is why it is grade 1 Relax and enjoy your breakfast :)) Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi MonaLisa, As you are HER2- negative I think you fall into the realms of being eligible for the Oncotype-DX Test (link) which has finally been approved by NICE. Has your oncologist mentioned this test for you. It determines the % rate of recurrence risk between having or not having chemotherapy. Obviously those who are HER2+ have to have chemo to get the Herceptin so it doesn't apply, but in your case I'm sure you qualify for this test. It used to be done privately at a tad over £2k but can now be done through the NHS Personally considering as you opted out of axillary clearance of nodes I would either try and get the oncotype test done if they will allow it for you. I think the results take around 10-14 days to come through. Having surgery and getting cancerous tumours removed is the first step in being cancer free, all the other treatments are insurance to try and keep you that way. Last thing you want is to turn chemo down to find it bites you in the bum in a few years :-( These meds folk shouldn't put patients into this position, they understand enough about your diagnosis to make that choice, we don't and it's almost impossible to find reliable up to date enough information to make informed decisions about something so important.

You should speak to your GP and have it confirmed that the practice will continue to prescribe as usual if you are recieving meds for any of the conditions listed below...... Conditions included on their 'hit list' are Mouth Ulcers, Oral Thrush, Dry/Sore Eyes, Diarrhoea, Infrequent Constipation etc Hopefully your GP's common sense will prevail making these meds still available via free prescription exemption cards to you, but it won't stop some pharmacists from meddling :-/ Just don't get me started on ® Registered Drugs vs Generics  lol Take Care, G n' J",

Fluoxetene had contraindications with both Tamoxifen and Docetaxel because it contains an enzyme which inhibits the effectiveness of both tamoxifen and docetaxel. Taken from EMC drugs database - Tamoxifen: Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, may lead to reduced concentrations of endoxifen, one of the most important active metabolites of tamoxifen. Therefore, fluoxetine should whenever possible be avoided during tamoxifen treatment (see section 4.5). Anti-depressants are often given as a type of pain relief.

Assume it is ok to have these before you need either of the above - you could ask how long you need to be 'off' Fluoxetene to get it out of your system before having T though ? Take care, G n' J",

When you mention your dizziness to the Rads Team, ask if there is anyone in the hospital they could refer you to that can help with this ? If someone there can try the EPLEY manouvere on you to see if that fixes it as it only takes around 10 minutes - Failing that there are meds that can help. It may be a far quicker way than going via GP referral as you no doubt still have several rad sessions to go. G n' J",

It all depends on how aggressive, size of tumour, type of breast cancer etc. Jackie was diagnosed at 56 and had mastectomy, chemo, rads and herceptin and is now on Letrozole for 5 years being diagnosed as ER+ PR+ HER2+ The underlying facts with younger ladies who get a BC diagnosis is because the breast tissue is denser in younger women it may not be picked up so easily by mammograms, ultrasound is far better and also if ER+ positive the Oestrogen produced by your ovaries may have been feeding the cancer cells. Which could explain why one of your tumours is large. Regarding Friday - Will this be the first time your lymph nodes have been needle biopsied or is this what they call a sentinel node biopsy (SNLB) ? G n' J",

You don't mention what stage your tumour was, so the 'aggressiveness' of that should also be taken into consideration. All the considerations you mention just muddy the water when trying to decide. Yes, chemo and the side effects can be tough, and yes if you decide to have it you will know you did all you could to avoid re-occurance but if you did decline chemo and heaven forbid it came back you would be wracked with guilt for your children and kicking yourself for declining it. Until you get some other replies, here's a couple of links to posts where this has been discussed before Post Thread One - Post Thread Two. Some members went for it, some didn't. Not a lot of help for your decision I know, but it gives you others views. Hope this helps, take care, George & Jackie  ",

It is different if you have surgery before chemo because the full diagnosis from removed tissue comes through from histology a lot quicker. Most diagnosed with BC get radiotherapy either just to the breast area but also the underarm lymph area if they find there are any affected nodes there (even if only a few cells are found)  As Julie mentions have you been informed about chemo prior to surgery to shrink tumours down or are you still in the scary land of the unknown about most of it ? If you are found to be HER2+ positive (around 1 in 5 are) you will need Herceptin and this is always given in conjunction with chemo. It isn't as effective if given on it's own, so NICE don't fund it to be used this way. Did you have your nodes checked last Friday or is it this Friday coming ? G n' J",

Whoever told you you will ony get one AFTER 5 years of being on them is talking rubbish..... There is more info about bone health Aromatase Inhibitors (letro and anastro) on the BCC site here (link) See Aromatse Inhibitors and how is osteoporosis diagnosed about halfway down the page. I find it hard to understand why with all your hip pain and being on Letrozole why the most obvious Dexa Scan option wasn't offered :(  See your GP and get them to arrange a dexa scan for you. This may need referring to a private unit as not all hospitals have a dexa scanner. It only takes around 15-20 minutes and is painless. My wife after her 6 month dexa scan was given Adcal+ Vit D daily and an alendronic acid tablet (one a week) to counter bone loss. What brand of Letrozole are you taking by the way ? as some have found just changing 'brands' helps. Hugs, G n' J",

All I can say is that from the initial diagnosis all I wanted to do was help wherever I could and be a wet shoulder, punchbag, rock, huggybear, taxi, and chemo buddy .  Sure it seemed that this invader was taking over our lives and it was running out of control but we got our heads around it and took the ride a day at a time. It's bad enough being a bloke trying to figure out what to buy for birthdays and christmas pressie's this bloody BC gave me the chance to show how much I cared and brought us a lot closer together. Sorry, I don't buy the \"being a breast cancer husband so stressful i'll escape by having an affair \" idea i'm afraid. That must seem as the ultimate insult just as you have lost a boob and feeling pretty crap about self esteem and reconstruction issues.. The easiest thing to do is \"just be there\" for your wife/partner \"who really does have all the stress\" and it's our remit to try and ease that as much as possible. I know a lot of blokes have the \"out of sight out of mind-put it on the back burner\" train of thought but it's def not the time when someone you love is going through any form of cancer. Even if in denial you cannot turn and run away, you have to face up to it as a team.  I really feel for those who have to take this crap journey on their own, it must be a lonely nightmare, but when you have a husband/partner and are still expected to mostly do it alone is cruel beyond belief. There's a saying along the lines of \"The way people treat you is a statement of who \"they are\" as a human being - It's not a statement about \"how you are\" as a person\"   Although hard, try not to stress, what will be will be, if he feels he cannot face the future, you may part, if it he is really sorry and has deep regret and you can forgive it may be repairable but the trust you had will never be the same :-( Really hope things work out for you, you must feel you have your own black cloud at the mo.

Assume the arm is the same side as was used for chemo or is it surgery side?  Could be chemo damaged the arm veins and the ZA is somehow making this worse, or if surgery side nerve damage from any removed armpit lymph nodes.  It is possible this is still peripheral neuropathy as it can take ages (up to a year) for most of the chemo baggage to ease off and some can become more permanent. J still has numb big toes from over 5 years back. Whatever this is, it sounds very much like the ZA is aggravating it, may be worth asking if there any other of the bisphosphonates you could have instead ? J was taking one Alendronic tablet (70mg) per week for 5 years while on Letrozole, so didn't have the ZA infusion. Have you tried using a hot water bottle or one of those microwaveable wheat packs to see if it eases the pain ? Not much help really, but hopefully someone else here will have had exactly the same experience with ZA and can pass on some advice. Take care, G n' J",

I'm thinking along the lines of what you mentioned about a lumpectomy, if they couldn't get clear margins and you had to go back in for second surgery it would heartbreaking. Just a thought - Is there, or has there been any history of breast or ovarian cancer with your immediate relatives ? Grandparents, aunts etc...

If you have a look at the links you could figure out which one it seems to be and use the what will help sections to try and ease this. Whichever one it is friction makes this condition worse. So try to be careful with things like walking up and down hills and staircases trying to walk flat footed rather than just having the balls of your feet taking all the weight, and to help your hands getting affected get help or one of those gadgets to undo bottle and jar lids (worse thing you can do is use an unscrewing action) Do keep a close eye on this as it can get worse before it gets better :( Take care, G n' J Tray41",

Also great is that they are giving you an ultrasound scan check, don't be fobbed off with just a mammogram as the tissue in younger women's breast is a lot denser and mammograms are not so accurate for this type of tissue. Be prepared for them taking very small needle biopsy samples if they do spot anything they feel needs checking out further but not alarmed at this either. Just because they spot something doesn't automatically mean cancer. Blocked milk ducts, calcification, cysts and benign lumps will show up too. I'm putting in the link to Macmillan Breast Page if you click the green text link and check it out. For info  about ultrasound and biopsy select the diagnosis button. Jackie's first symptom was a nipple that started to invert slightly so it can be a sign, have both your nipples always been inverted or is this something that has happened over time ? It is very rare to get it in both breasts at the same time.... You say you are not worried yet, but this may change if they take biopsy samples and you enter a waiting results stage which can really mess with your head, some centres can let you know same day, others can take up to 2 weeks :-( Depends on how big their centre is and what facilities they have and depends on the types of checks and tests they carry out on the tissue. Hopefully it will be confirmed to be nothing dodgy, but do keep posting any questions and concerns you have Nic, we're all here to help. Take care and good luck, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Hi Radwoman,  Think I can figure this out. It looks like the score they give cells when they are examined under the  microscope to give the  grade. There is a huge dif between TNM (Stage) and TPM (is for grade) TNM is used to describe the STAGE of cancer. T stands for tumour N for node involvement M for metastases However, the GRADE is defined on by using TPN. Tubule Formation = T Nuclear Pleomorphism = P Mitosis Count = M That's about the description of the cells and how much they look different to normal body cells. Each category is scored 1, 2 or 3. Tubule Formation (% of Carcinoma composed of tubular structures like a normal cell) Score: over 75% 1 10-75% 2 less than 10% 3 Nuclear Pleomorphism (Change in cells)  Score: Small, uniform cells 1 Moderate increase in size and variation 2 Marked variation 3 Mitosis Count (Cell division)  Score: Up to 7 1 8 to 14 2 15 or more 3 If you score 8 or 9 you are classed as Grade 3. So you scored 3 in the first 2 categories and 2 in the last category, your total is 8 which is Grade 3. Hope this is near enough correct, as I'm not medically trained. Just picked up lots of 'stuff' on the way :-)   It's your body if you want it all clarified do ask them to explain it. Regarding Stage, what type of breast cancer were you diagnosed with ?

      "Content": "Morning Bowbelle  Unfortunately nothing could be further from the truth :( The letrozole 'drug' part is obviously the same but that only makes up 2.5mg of the tablet and various other fillers are used to bulk the tablet up to a convenient size - These fillers are not stanardised and it's these variations which can cause so many problems finding a particular brand which works best for you. There is a lengthy discussion started about a month ago which you can fine here (link) which may be worth you having a read through. You don't mention which 'brand' you are taking at the moment but there are at least 8 generic brands of Letrozole besides the original Femara make. Water retention is a listed side effect of Letrozole, are you taking any Diuretic tablets to help with that - and it's those causing you to visit the loo so many times during the night ? Hope this is of some help, G n' J",

You are all a bit wobbly and unsure about how it will end up. Does it all work out and you pedal off into the sunset or crash into a ditch. Only thing you can do is box up all your worries tape it down well and shove it right to the back of your mind hopefully never to be opened again. You can't live the rest of your life fearing the worst it will stop you enjoying the new life you have been given. It may not seem much of a life compared to the old one you were living and loving with both boobs and no cancer worries but that Lucy has gone now and been replaced by an upgraded version who is a bit battered and bruised but minus the cancer but is struggling to accept her second chance ? You may find this a good read - After The Treatment Finishes - Then What? by Dr Peter Harvey. This is a free read, just click the link. It starts a bit slow but bear with it, it does make sense and can help you understand what the hell just happened. Hope this helps a bit, take care, George & Jackie",

The E part makes your pee pink for a day or so so don't go thinking this is blood in your urine. Hope you are recovering well from your surgery ? - mastectomy with immediate DIEP can be a tough call for a while. Best place for chemo discussions is our regular monthly chemo club.

If you look at todays previous posts you will find her question. This may well be a look and check out scan for them to see if you are getting bone / joint pain from osteoporosis caused by the Tamoxifen or radiotherapy damage. If it's a four hour scan it'll be the scan they perform at the Nuclear Medicine radiology dept where they inject you with a low dosage isotope give it a few hours to get into your bones then scan for bone damage. Not going to sugar coat this but unfortunately it is also the same type of scan they use to detect bone mets damage. We're not going there yet it's way too early to tell............ So tell the fear and panic to bugger off. http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/tests/bone-scan Everything crossed for you next week Binny, you take care, Hugs,  George & Jackie",

When other companies were allowed to make Letrozole tablets they had to make it under their own brand name. So only Femara is the original make, the others are generic brands. These other brands are a lot cheaper, so they are the more common ones placed onto your repeat. There is a bit more to it regarding different 'fillers and coatings' used between brands but the drug content is near enough the same. If you think of it like if it says letrozole on your repeat prescription you can be offered any brand of letrozole, but if it says Femara you should get that only. G n' J Edit - As you have found out Sandoz is the generic drugs section of Novartis the owner of Femara®  :)",

      "Content": "Hiya tej,  These are classic side effects of both your meds. The Avastin / Bevacizumab can raise your blood pressure slightly which can lead to slight random nose bleeds and/or a bit of a runny nose. As for the numb, tingling fingers and toes these symptoms are caused by the effect of Paclitaxel / Taxol on nerves. It\u2019s called peripheral neuropathy. You may also find it hard to fasten buttons or do other fiddly tasks. Tell your onco doctor about both these symptoms. They sometimes need to lower the dose of the drug. The symptoms usually improve slowly after treatment finishes but in some people they may never fully go away. Another quick point worth mentioning is if you have numb fingers be careful with hot water as it may be hotter than you are feeling it to be to avoid scalding and if the tingling starts getting painful do ask about help with this early on, as this can get quite bad if left even to the extent of having problems walking. You can help your hands and feet by reducing friction which can make it worse. Take care walking up and down stairs or hills and be careful using your hands / fingers in a twisting motion like undoing bottle or jar tops, using screwdrivers etc Take care, G n' J",

There are several types of breast cancer recurrence. Link to BCC on Reccurance Regional recurrence (also known as locally advanced) Breast cancer that has come back and has spread to the tissues and lymph nodes (lymph glands) around the chest, neck and under the breastbone. Recurrence Distant  Also called metastatic or secondary breast cancer. When cancer cells from the breast have spread to other parts of the body such as the bones, lungs, liver or brain. Remission when the signs and symptoms of a disease can no longer be found; this may be temporary or permanent. Often written as NED (no evidence of disease) S Secondary breast cancer when breast cancer cells spread from the first (primary) tumour in the breast through the lymphatic or blood system to other parts of the body. Also called metastases, advanced breast cancer, secondaries or stage 4 breast cancer. Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) Identifies whether or not the first lymph node (or nodes) are clear of cancer cells. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) A type of targeted internal radiotherapy which uses radioactive beads to deliver radiation to the cancer. Can be used to treat breast secondaries. Seroma  Many people who have had breast cancer surgery or lymph node removal develop a collection of fluid called a seroma. This can either be under the arm and/or in the breast or chest wall. The build up of fluid may cause some discomfort, but is not a cause for concern and is usually reabsorbed by the body over time. If the seroma is large, restricts arm movement, causes discomfort or doesn\u2019t subside, your specialist or breast care nurse may decide to draw off (aspirate) the fluid using a needle and syringe.  This is usually a painless procedure as the area around the wound is still likely to be numb. Sometimes a seroma will refill after it has been aspirated. Some people may need to be aspirated several times over a period of many weeks before it goes completely. Stage Staging  The size of the cancer and how far it has spread. See Staging and Grading. STB Stereotactic core biopsy Taking a sample of tissue using a needle biopsy device connected to a mammogram machine and linked to a computer; helps locate the exact position of the area to be biopsied. Stereotactic radiotherapy (also known as radiosurgery) A very precise radiation treatment used in secondary breast cancer. May also be referred to as Gamma Knife or CyberKnife.  At the Royal Marsden Steroids Helps reduce allergic reactions to chemo and has mild anti sickness  benefit. Steroids are usually given in conjunction with anti-emetics (anti sickness tablets) Commonly Dexamethasone or the newer Emend. More information on anti sickness drugs at Cancer Research site. Subcutaneous injection or sub-cut.  An injection into the fatty tissue under the skin. Surgical margin How close the cancer cells are to the edges of the whole area of tissue removed during surgery. See Clear Margins. Systemic Treatment  Drugs that treat the whole body, for example, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted therapies. T TAC This is a chemo combination not to be confused with Taxol/Taxotere only. Consists of Docetaxel (T) Adriamycin (A) (also known as Doxorubicin) and (C) Cyclophosphamide©) TAC Tamoxifen An anti oestrogen hormone therapy drug. Tamoxifen Usually given if pre-menopausal. Targeted therapies (also know as biological therapies) A group of drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by mimicking substances that occur in your own body interfering with the biology of the cancer cells. They target specific processes in the cells that cause cancer to grow. Taxol A chemotherapy drug. see Paclitaxel Also sometimes used in private clinics using lower dosed weekly sessions instead of the three weekly nhs Docetaxel sessions to lessen side effects. Taxotere Chemotherapy drug originally derived from Yew (Taxanes) see Docetaxel  (The T part of FEC-T) TC Chemotherapy combination of Taxotere (Docetaxel) and Cyclophosphamide TC TCHP New treatment regime for neo-adjuvant (before surgery) treatment of HER2+ Positive BC.

A targeted therapy used to treat HER2 positive breast cancer, and one of a group of drugs called monoclonal antibodies. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Tumour markers Substances produced by some cancers or by the body itself as a response to cancer and can be detected by blood tests or by other means as an aid to diagnosis. Notably marker CA15-3 for breast cancer levels are mostly used to monitor responses to treatments rather than for diagnosing. Tyverb see Lapatinib  Given in tablet form as a treatment for HER positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. U Ultrasound scan Uses high frequency sound waves to produce an image. Ultrasound V Vacuum assisted biopsy (VAP) Use of a vacuum assisted hollow needle syringe and local anesthetic to remove breast tissue for examination under a microscope, often when a previous biopsy was difficult to perform or more tissue is needed to make a diagnosis. Sometimes it can be used as an alternative to surgery to remove a whole area of breast tissue (called a vacuum assisted excision biopsy). Vascular Invasion Term used if cancer cells have spread through the walls of tissue or vessels and affected or invaded nearby blood supplies. i.e. Lympho vascular invasion Vinorelbine also known as Navelbine. Is a type of chemotherapy drug known as vinca alkaloids which can be given either through an iv line or as tablets. W Wide local excision (WLE) Surgery to remove breast cancer with a margin of healthy tissue. Sometimes called breast-conserving surgery. WLE Lumpectomy.

      "Content": "Hi Lobdobs   Warm welcome to the group hope you are recovering well from surgery and not finding the exercises too painful. DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) actually is a cancer, but it is \"in situ\" which is med speak for in only one place (so not spread)  It was found before it reached the invasive stage which is why some say it isn't cancer, because it isn't yet invading, but it would have done if left :( The real clue is in the word carcinoma. If you are being offered radiotherapy with no other follow up treatments like Chemotherapy or hormone inhibitor tablet if ER+ positive then rads is going to be your only way to make certain any cancer cells that although unlikely, could have been missed are zapped by the radiotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. Because you had a lumpectomy and still have most of your original tissue even with clear margins the radiotherapy is insurance to avoid future risks. 15 sessions is the standard rads regime =  daily sessions Mon-Fri for 3 weeks.

Pleased to read you seem to be recovering well, having said that a mastectomy still comes as a shock as it all seems to happen so  quickly :( Have you had your post surgery pathology report as yet ? Just wondering if you know your ER / PR (oestrogen and progesterone) and HER2 (positive or negative) results yet as these will have some bearing on your treatment plan. Assume you haven't seen the oncologist yet so you won't know what type of chemo you will be having at the moment ? There is a rolling monthly chemo club here too - You can find the November Chemo Club by clicking the green text link. Please don't fret too much about them finding some cells in your lymph nodes it is fairly common to have some found there, that is why they carry out the sentinel node biopsy. What parts of diet are you having problems getting your head around, most here eat what they like when they like - It's part of the reward system :-) There are times on chemo when your taste buds go wacky and you can feel a little nauseous so can lose your appetite at times.

There are quite few TNBC ladies here who you will get to 'meet' over the next few days while you settle in here.

Anti-cancer drugs that cause nerve damage are most likely to affect sensory nerves, but some can also affect the motor nerves and the autonomic nerves. Peripheral neuropathy often affects the hands, feet and lower legs. This is because the longer a nerve is, the more vulnerable it is to injury. Nerves going to the hands, feet and lower legs are some of the longest in the body. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are usually mild to begin with and gradually get worse. A change in sensation You may have a feeling of heaviness, burning or pins and needles in the affected area. Alternatively, you may notice unusual sensations, such as a feeling of warmth or burning when touching something cold. Increased sensitivity You may find that even the lightest touch or pressure in the affected area feels uncomfortable or painful. Pain This can be mild or more severe. The pain may be felt as sharp and stabbing or as a burning sensation, or it may feel like minor electric shocks. There are treatments to help relieve pain. Numbness There may be a loss of sensitivity or feeling in the affected area. Often the feet and fingertips are the first places to be affected. Muscle weakness A muscle may lose strength if it isn\u2019t being stimulated by a nerve. Depending on which muscles are affected, this may make it difficult to walk, climb stairs or do other tasks. Difficulty buttoning clothes or picking up small objects If the nerve endings in the fingers are affected, you may not be able to do \u2018fiddly\u2019 tasks, such as fastening small buttons or tying shoelaces. Difficulty with balance, walking and coordination You may find that you stumble or trip when walking; uneven surfaces may be particularly difficult. You may feel clumsy at times or you may feel that your body isn't doing what you want it to. Your sense of where things are around you may become less certain. Constipation and feeling bloated This can happen when the nerves that control the rate that food passes through the bowel (autonomic nerves) are affected. Let your doctor or nurse know if you're having these problems. Feeling light-headed or dizzy when you sit up or stand up These symptoms are sometimes caused by a sudden drop in your blood pressure, known as postural hypotension. This can happen when the nerves that control blood pressure and heart rate (autonomic nerves) are damaged. Your doctor can see if this is the cause of your symptoms by checking your blood pressure when you're lying down and standing up. Anti-cancer drugs and peripheral neuropathyBack to top There are many different anti-cancer drugs. The types that most frequently cause peripheral neuropathy are: Vinca alkaloids, which include vinblastine (Velbe®), vincristine (Oncovin®),vinorelbine (Navelbine®) and vindesine (Eldisine®). Vincristine is the most likely one of these drugs to cause peripheral neuropathy. The platinum based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. The taxanes docetaxel (Taxotere®) and paclitaxel (Taxol®).",

Only thing is it may help with some types of chemo drugs but not others ? and may not be the way to go if you can't afford any further weight loss on top of that some cancers can cause or if diabetic etc. So do check this is suitable for your cancer type especially if abdominally affected.

This is them, not you and it may not apply to you very much at all. Don't try to react to what may happen in the future, concentrate on all this one small step at a time. Their treatments may be a lot more invasive like full mastectomies and total node clearance, pain from secondary tumours, reactions to chemo, big hits of radiotherapy, there are a whole host of reasons but even if this does occur it is only usually a temporary thing until it either clears up or pain relief eases it until you recover. There are well over 1,000 breast cancer cases diagnosed per WEEK in the uk - Most don't post here if things are going ok, you usually only get to read about the problems, so please bear that in mind :-) Try to do things to take your mind of it a bit, and enjoy a sunny Sunday, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline,  Gotcha' - Rads are mostly very do'able. They have you in around a week before your sessions start to give you a bit of a pep talk about what goes on and possibly will show you the 'room' with the linear accelerator in it. Make a note of any questions you may have beforehand as this will be a chance to ask about any concerns you may have. Also ask about free parking (see below) At this time they will give you some tiny black pin point tattoo's which are used to line the machine up with so they get precise areas treated - this can take a while fiddling about getting you into the correct position but only needs doing once.  Also ask if they supply cream, some don't so you will have to buy your own - any unscented aqueous cream will do but some prefer the extra healing qualities of an Aloe Vera based cream. Oh and don't use any underarm deodorants, wet wipes are fine. If you intend driving yourself to your sessions it's ok to start with but gets progressively more tiring so if you can get someone to take you if only for the last week that will help. Take something to kill the waiting time, a book,  iPad / games, puzzle books etc - The session only takes around 15 minutes but there can be a bit of a wait to get in at busy times especially if they are running late which sometimes happens. You will usually be given a gown to change into when you arrive so wear clothing that is easy to get in and out of. Most hospital car parks have free parking for Radiotherapy patients. This can either be by a pre-paid card you can collect on your first session or by recovering the cost after treatment. To get a card you will need your appointment sheet with all the dates on as proof. Check online or by phoning your unit to see about this. You can get some sunburn or slight blistering nearer the end of treatment cycles as long as the skin doesn't break it should be ok but this sunburn feeling does carry on for around two weeks after the sessions end. This is the BCC booklet about 'Breast Cancer Radiotherapy' there can be side effects so here is the link to a Macmillan Radiotherapy Booklet 'Breast Radiotherapy, Possible Long Term Side Effects' too.

One quick comment on your steroids, don't take any after 4 pm try and work it so they are in your system early or you will have one heck of a problem getting to sleep you'll be so wide awake with nothing to do except either worry about everything or getting up and doing some housework - neither are a good option at 2am  :-) You are doing fine just don't be alarmed if you feel really tired and achey in a couple of days it takes a bit longer for Tax to get right into your system.

Lovely to read you have dodged that bullet, but as you mention ALH can mean you have a slightly higher risk of developing Lobular BC later. Although ALH isn't even a pre-cancerous condition it is used as a marker for being at higher risk. Especially if any close relatives (grand parents, parents, siblings, aunts etc) have also had breast cancer themselves. You may have found this researching but in case you missed it there is this page about Hyperplasia at breast cancer care uk. and further info specifically about Lobular Hyperplasia here. You say they have penciled you in for yearly mammograms now - It may be better if you actually had ultrasound scans as well as the mammogram because these are a lot more accurate at picking up any changes earlier. I don't think this is a minor issue, you are gathering info and being vigilant which is great for your future health :) Take care, G n' J",

If you are down at heart it also brings down those who visit or phone and they find conversations very hard to deal with, so the visits and calls get less which is the last thing you need. Your life is may seem empty and worthless at the present time, all you just need a some support to lift you a little - be it in the form of a course of tablets or a new found interest in your life, but it is a ball you will have to start rolling to help you move forward.

A 5 night week will mean an extra 10 hours weekly, do you think that is do'able after 2 weeks ? If not maybe ask about another couple of weeks at 4 hours (depending on your finances)  Have no idea what the job entails but maybe it it any stretching / lifting affecting scar tissue that is causing some discomfort ?  Is there any way to make whatever could be causing this discomfort easier for you ?

You could ask what (if any) booster sessions they may add to give a more intense burst to the area you had the extra capsular in ? Also which creams they recommend, do they supply them or will you have to get this yourself :( If you have a sympathetic GP you may be able to get a prescription for R1 and R2 Waterjel (you need both) which is specifically formulated for radiotherapy but as a 5 week course is around £70 they may just offer you a script for a cheaper large tub of generic cream - saying they don't know about it - state your health authority area doesn't supply if (or whatever excuse fits)  :) If you want more info about R1 and R2 (link) also their Frequently Asked Questions page can be found here. Ask about free parking too, as most hospitals provide free parking for Rads patients, but you will need to show your appointment dates letter as confirmation.

Post cancer people re-evaluate their lives, cancer can bring out the worst in couples, or put added financial / emotional stress onto a relationship that already is showing signs of cracks.  Depending on her post surgery pathology report there may be other long term treatments she has to still go through as yet as well :( Radiotherapy, hormone inhibitor tablets, maybe even chemo ? It's definitely a long haul on a rocky road, all you can do is try your best and hope it all works out for both of you. Sorry, our messages crossed paths - Think the best way to put this to her is to get her to understand how she felt when you needed her help and support and possibly also felt a bit guilty about getting it and now it's payback - as it's all about her this time around.

But you shouldn\u2019t have the flu vaccine if you - Are allergic to egg (the vaccine is made from hen\u2019s eggs) As Ronstar mentions do check this out with your oncologist, they will probably recommend it, but I have no idea if being diabetic makes any difference to your risk ?

      "Content": "Hi GMc  This is far more common than you would believe - with both genders. Some men with cancer can be pure evil to live with for a while when cancer comes to call :( You learn to be a bit of an emotional sponge soaking up all her fear and anger that having been told you have cancer causes. The first thing you think of when being told is 'I'm going to die'  Next thing is how do I protect those who love me..... and an irrational mind will say put up protective defences, drive those who care about me away so I don't have to feel guilty about what my diagnosis and treatment will put them through. You are bearing the brunt because she loves you and you are probably the only person she can unload to and get away with it. It's nothing personal, although it may seem that way. Hug her, tell her you love and are going nowhere and you will survive this as a family but don't stifle her or wrap her up in cotton wool try to find that fine line between trying to be normal and stepping up to the mark when she needs support, a listening pair of ears or a comforting shoulder to lean on. What stage of treatment is your partner at, just diagnosed or having treatment - as this stage usually eases after awhile. It can be just as tough for the carer as it is the patient - If you take a look through the Carers Group you joined there are so many posts very similar to yours, so you are definitely not alone in this.

      "Content": "Hi Fidelys, Warm welcome to the breast group, a club no one wanted to find themselves joining but a great place to be at a tough time. They can give you a stage at the moment which denotes size but any other diagnosis information won't come through until after your removed tissue results come back from the histology / pathology unit around a week after surgery. It is for the most part this information which they use to plan and tailor any other treatments you may need. For instance if you are found to be ER+ and or PR+ positve it means your oestrogen and/or progesterone would have been helping to feed the cancer cells so you get long term tablets for this. Your tumour will also be 'graded' from 1 - 4 most ladies here come in around 2 or 3 if you are lucky it will be a 1, nobody wants to hear there's is a 4 as this means it has invaded other areas/ organs. A 4 is rarely found at this early stage, you would no doubt had other symptoms if this were the case, so don't fret over this. Your HER2 status is also found at this time if you are found to be HER2+ positive this will definitely guarantee chemotherapy as you have to have the chemo in order to be given Herceptin which is the primary drug for HER2+ (don't worry about not knowing all these terms) you'll soon pick them up. Other factors also may result in chemo, grade 2 can be borderline, grade 3 is where chemo is offered and any lymph-node involvement is taken into account. Being classed as triple negative where you are ER/PR and HER2 negative (for all three) will also mean chemotherapy for sure. During your mastectomy they will no doubt take a few lymphnodes to sample (called a SNB - sentinel node biopsy) , if they find any cancer cells there, they may either remove the rest of your nodes at the same time, or call you back for this surgery a week or so later. Just letting you know a little about what could happen next, but don't worry about any of this for now, just concentrate on your surgery and recovery - one step at a time is the way to go. If you have any specific questions you would like answered by the lovely ladies here do create a New Discussion and ask away - (there is no such thing as a silly question) to get some support and advice, we're all here to help.

      "Content": "Hi  Allison,  Trying to figure out when is best to return to work is a tough one. Depends on what you do, how much stuffing the treatment has knocked out of you and how long it takes for all the side effects to wane. Jackie had mx 3 fec 3 tax and 15 rads and was off for a total of 8 months. She felt she could have gone back a month or so earlier but because she works with mrsa patients and the ever present dreaded norovirus threat she was given an extra 2 months off. First 2 weeks back she worked 2 hours at a time only, then 4 hours at a time for the next 2 weeks testing the water before going back to normal hours thereafter. Her work entails a lot of patient handling, corridor walking and stairs to tackle so the extra 2 months off made a great difference. It will always hit you hard to start with, using muscles that have had a long holiday while you had to fight the BC battle. LIke other advice here start things off slowly and see how it goes and if your manager/boss tries to get too pushy, tough they'll have to cope, it's your life and if they don't value you as an employee use your slow return to work to find alternative job. Most employers are brilliant when shi* like this happens but there are always some who couldn't care less and try to lay a guilt trip on you. If you can financially afford to grab some more time off and make the most of the change in the weather that's supposed to happen next week  :-) I think SSP is payable for a max of 28 weeks, dunno how long you have been off so far ?

The main reason for such extensive cctv is to make sure they can maintain close observation for patient body movement that can throw the guidance off. It only has to be a cm out and it could target areas not meant to be treated. The margins can be quite close to lung, heart and other sensitive areas and arteries that is why they take so long setting the alignment marks so precisely every day. They have almost certainly seen it all at one time or another, from those who have a panic attack to patients shaking with fear. Bit like having a midwife and maternity nurses close up at a birth, it's all for your benefit so try to view it as a safeguard. Hope this helps,  George & Jackie. ",

Is this a different type of BC this time around, just wondering what type and treatment you had first time around and if it will differ this time - Assume you have had your post surgery pathology report by now ? There are several ladies here who have been found to have cancer in both breasts after first just having it discovered it in one. No doubt there are a few who have been diagnosed twice like you. It could be you feel cancer has got it in for you and has stolen your mojo or because you already know what treatment may lie ahead that is making you feel low - but you can do this... Hopefully the good ladies here can help you get your mojo back. With a 1 in 3 chance of getting cancer at some stage in their lives, a lot of those people you seem a bit jealous of will have cancer knocking at their door at some time, they just haven't had it diagnosed yet!!!

As you are finding this is a steep learning curve so lets help to see if we can at least help you find the 4 corners and if we're lucky some edge bits too :-) Please do think long and hard about this nipple choice. I'm fairly sure most here would not want to keep a nipple that has been anywhere near close to a tumour in case it comes back to bite them in a year or two's time. Last thing you want is to have to go through all this treatment again. Another point to bear in mind is that the surgeons do try to take the minimum amount of tissue to keep as good a breast shape as possible, the down side to this is 1 in 4 get called back for a little more to be taken because they don't quite get clear margins of cancer free tissue.  The 'feelings' you get from a reconstructed nipple will be nowhere near the same either but at least you will have something as a focal point. You could go the 3D tattoo route depends on if it can be matched to your other nipple. Just to make you aware the pathology information from the removed tissue and sentinel nodes can change your treatment programme depending on the results you won't find this out until two weeks after the surgery. The MRI and/or CT scans are standard so yes, normal but not everybody gets one - they just try to gather as much info as possible so they can fine tune and tailor your treatment programme post surgery. Hope this is of some use, if you have any more questions even if they seem 'silly' ones just holler. We're all here to help, take care George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Morning Nicky, Yes, that's a good info page - Remember reading that quite a while back and posted something very similar into this reply (see below) about oestrogens back in August. Oestrogen plays such an important role throughout the body, zapping it's production is bound to have knock on effects :( Hugs, G n' J SpicedTea  Oestrogen is one of the bodies feel good hormones and there are 3 types of it (one of which is still made post menopause) and it circulates around the body in the bloodstream so gets everywhere. What does Oestrogen do in the body? Oestrogen controls the first part of the menstrual cycle, causes changes in the breasts and uterus, regulates various other metabolic processes, including bone growth and cholesterol levels and keeps organs such as the brain, liver and heart healthy. Symptoms of an Oestrogen Imbalance One of the difficulties with identifying an oestrogen imbalance is that many of the symptoms associated with oestrogen deficiency can be the same as oestrogen dominance. They include; Temperature issues such as hot flushing Irritability or depression Poor concentration and forgetfulness Fatigue and lethargy Loss of confidence Aching joints Weight gain, especially around the stomach and thighs Osteoporosis Digestive complaints Endometriosis Fibroids Infertility I think your Oncologists WD40 metaphor is pretty damn good as research shows a lack of oestrogen can cause lower fluid levels around joints. This where the hormone inhibitor tablets (AI's) stop the production of the third oestrogen type (Estrone) after the menopause and also where ovaries have been removed or chemically stopped - which is there to take care of joints after the menopause :( Estrone is given to horses to soften tendons and ligaments so a lack of it must surely affect people (stiffness) in the same way too ? Declining oestrogen levels are also directly linked to declining levels of serotonin, and this lack of serotonin can lead to low mood, and even trigger symptoms of depression. Besides serotonin, oestrogen also blocks the production of cortisol, the stress hormone that triggers your 'fight or flight' reflex, and progesterone has a calming effect. With lower levels of both hormones, you may find yourself feeling more panicky and experiencing symptoms of anxiety, making it very difficult for you to feel relaxed. These two hormones, progesterone and particularly oestrogen, therefore play a really important part in helping you maintain a positive sense of emotional wellbeing and, as their levels decrease, you become increasingly vulnerable to these distressing changes in mood. As for PN this can take a whole year to repair itself as best as it can, but anyone suffering from chemo induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) may be left with some permanent residual damage like numbness or nerve pain - (mostly affecting toes and fingertips) Hope this helps and doesn't have too many 'should's and maybe's :) Hugs, G n' J",

Best you will get is NED (no evidence of disease) which isn't quite the same thing. 3 = It is best you do - because you will then be covered by the disability / equality acts. This is taken from the book 'Work and Cancer' which has a section about looking for a new job on page 76. Many people with cancer don\u2019t consider themselves to be  disabled, and if they\u2019re asked in general terms whether they  consider themselves disabled they\u2019ll say \u2018no\u2019. However, if you\u2019re  asked by your employer if you\u2019re disabled, you should say \u2018yes\u2019 for  the purposes of the Equality Act and the Disability Discrimination  Act.

Jackie works in a residential nursing home where the work can be physical at times and originally was told to take the full 6 months off to fully recover but because of some residents being MRSA and C-Dif sufferers, coupled with lots of stair climbing and corridor walking our GP gave her an added two months. She went back on a phased return but because of ongoing 'baggage' from Letrozole she stepped up from 10 hours a week to 16 hours and for her that is now plenty. Seen plenty of posts here from those who in retrospect made the wrong choice and went back too early considering the battering they had just endured and it affected them emotionally feeling they could no longer do their job as before. So maybe if you feel up to it and you feel your job is do'able, give it a go, but do expect to only be able to cope with doing half your normal hours as you may find just after midday all your get up and go, has got up and gone  :-) Don't underestimate the chemo fatigue, take care, George & Jackie",

I think the figure is quite low, so you may be one of the unlucky few :( You sure this could be the Tamoxifen and not late effect chemo baggage ? However it is a little early and your body may get used to the Tamoxifen so give it more time and see how it all pans out. If there is no improvement or if it seems to be getting worse you can explain this to you Onco and find out if there is an alternative, or ask them to find out just how much of a benefit you are getting from the Tamoxifen and consider if it's worth continuing if it is for little gain ?

Paula  / Pfom  Your oncologist may not give your 'lucky pill' meds the OK, They are very wary of people taking anything during chemo and there are so many products out there most haven't been trialed or cleared for use during chemo so they mostly give a blanket ban :( This is a tricky one to make a decision about as you won't find out your migraine risks if you don't try the scalp cooling for your first session after then it would be too late anyway :-/  Depends on how much you would like to keep at least some of your hair ?

      "Content": "Hi  Chris,  When you had treatment for BC were you given any of the 5 year hormone inhibitor tablets like Tamoxifen or Letrozole ?  Reason for asking is that there are two types of bone scan. One is a DEXA scan which checks for bone thinning caused by lack of oestrogen caused by those hormone tabs which can lead to being Osteopaenic and feeling a bit arthritic. If this is the case and they find bone thinning you'll just get adcal and sunvit and maybe alendronic acid tablets to take. The other type of bone scan is usually performed using a CT or MRI scanner.  Did they tell you which type of scan you are to have ? Best wishes and good luck on the results for whichever scan you have. Oh, and put £5 in the swear box for using Google  :-)",

Like MM said it could be something like eczema or a late side effect of rads ? The symptoms of Paget's are - The most common symptom is a red, scaly rash involving the nipple, which may spread to the areola (the darker skin around the nipple). The rash can feel itchy or you may have a burning sensation. The nipple may be inverted (pulled in) and there may also be discharge from the nipple. Paget\u2019s disease can look like other skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis. But there are differences. For example, Paget\u2019s disease affects the nipple from the start while eczema generally affects the areola region and only rarely affects the nipple. Also, Paget\u2019s disease usually occurs in one breast while most other skin conditions tend to affect both breasts. You are doing the right thing getting it checked out if only for answers and peace of mind. Take care, G n' J",

The aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrozole & exemestane) are better for post meno women because their ovaries have already gone into shutdown. As the AI's aren't as effective as Tamoxifen for fully halting oestrogen production from the ovaries - hence the Zoladex to take care of this. It no doubt will be because you are prone to thrombosis as Tamoxifen does have a slightly higher risk of this, so for you this is probably the best way forward :) Good luck for minimal side effects, G n' J",

A bit like how oestrogen production drops right down after pregnancy and can cause post natal depression. Slight feelings of doom and gloom are not that uncommon with tamox but seeing as you have only been on them for 10 days you may find it gets better after a while longer on them. Phone your onco nurse/ dr  tomorrow and tell them how tamox is making you feel, they may suggest you stop for a while and see if you improve. If that's the case they may be able to switch you onto an alternative. Mind you an alternative may not be any better just different side effects. Just a thought, don't know if you take them morning or evening, if you are taking them of an evening and wake feeling like that, try switching to taking them in the morning - might help - anything is worth a try, but don't keep this to yourself, they wouldn't want you suffering, you are going to be on them for a while, so you have to get  something sorted out to help bring those smiles back.

Perhaps there is some medical history that makes Fluorouracil chemotherapy unsuitable for you. If you would have benefitted from it, they would have offered it. There is an info page about EC here. As for recovery from surgery - some take longer to heal and develop more scar tissue than others.

You didn't post your other message in the wrong place :)   it's just the new to site group is like a landing pad so regular members can reply and direct you to the the most suitable areas here. From what you describe this sounds like nerves that were damaged during surgery trying to repair themselves, this can cause some really weird and varying sensations at times but does ease off quite a bit, however it can also take quite a while and in some cases can leave you feeling a slightly numb in some areas. This effect is quite common and quite a few ladies here have had this. It may also be an internal stitch rubbing  if those were used - if that is the case it should ease when any swelling has gone.? Depending on how you recover from surgery chemo can start as quickly as 4 weeks but the average is around 6 weeks, some even longer. You will usually get about a weeks notice and go in to the chemo unit for a pre session assessment where they weigh and measure you as the dosage levels are worked out on BMI The thought of having chemo can be a scary trip into the unknown there are common side effects but there are also ways of dealing with those, so don't keep secrets :) Take care, G n' J",

Do take all the meds to keep on top of the nausea even if you feel well as it's easier to prevent sickness than stop it once it has started. Drink plenty of fluids 2 litres a day at least. Hairloss can start 10-22 days from first session and a sore scalp is a good clue to this starting to happen. Any questions keep us posted and we'll all help where we can.

People only post when they have a problem, those who are doing OK have no need to put up a message so you get a very one sided view of chemo :-/ It's only after you have been here a while you tend to notice 'I didn't have many problems with the FEC or T' messages, or I found one was OK but not the other etc. If you are the type who gets travel sickness or had issues with morning sickness when pregnant you could be one of those who does get the feelings of nausea worse with FEC but there are better anti-nausea tablets you can get if this happens. You just don't know how either will affect you until you start your sessions, then you have to ride out your own particular storm be that breezy with showers or a whole week feeling crappy. For most is is just the first week with FEC and days 4-10 with T that are the worst and it soon passes and you come back out of the chemo fog almost overnight :) However there can be some longer term issues as uncommon side effects - the trick is not to keep secrets. If anything seems different tell your Onco or breast care nurse and write about it here to get answers / advice so you can keep on top of \"stuff\" a lot of the time it is something that soon passes but can be a sign of a problem in the making that needs nipping in the bud.

Reason for asking about chemo is that the list of side effects is about the same, so if she is undergoing chemo, the feeling of being run over by a bus could be from that.

If you type strattice into the search this site box there's bound to be a couple of links if you want more info. oh, and btw tram/diep is where they use stomach skin, tissue and/or muscle to use for the recon.

I think this is where the scare mongering comes in - as some say 'IF' there are any cells floating around in lymph fluid this will move them around more ? but lymph fluid is moving around all the time and the chemo and rads etc should have zapped those (hopefully) anyway. They are also reckoned on being helpful if you have some osteopaenia issues (not arthritis though) A lot of fitness centre's  will need a doctors note to say using these is OK before they will let you use them but this wouldn't apply if yours was at home. There is a lot on conflicting info about these, so If in doubt ask your GP for their opinion, but as Julia says any activity will get your fluids moving around. Having said that, half of the med's folk can't agree on this subject either :-/ Take care, G n' J",

What you could do is contact your onco team and explain the problems you are having and ask if they will reduce the dosage for you. You could also ask about Taxol instead of Docetaxel but don't get your hopes up with that option. Good luck getting a reduction - 20% may not seem much but it helps a lot with the side effects.

Days 3-6 are usually the worst then you slowly come out of it although for the second week you are more prone to picking up bugs while your white count is low and you will be feeling lethargic. Then you day by day perk up just in time for round two. Some suffer more s/e's than others - Fingers crossed you are one of the lucky ones who sail through it just feeling slightly crap. Be prepared for the odd duvet day on the sofa and daytime tv or a dvd though. You did the right thing checking your temp it's quite important to get to know your routine. Temps can shoot up overnight if you have picked up a bug so if you notice it reaching 37.5 give the onco dept a ring, they may have you in and check you out, maybe give you some antibio's. Keep up any sickness meds wether you feel you need them or not because if you are sick you won't know if you brought up the tabs then it's a bugger trying to keep on top of it. As for the hair Jackie's head started getting sore and as her hair was long the weight of it pulling on the dying roots was making it feel worse so she had a short pixie cut (instant relief) until it started falling out a week or so later, then she got me to shave it for her. I called her my Bad Ass Biker Chick  :-) Are your 6 chemo's all FEC, or 3 x FEC and 3 x Tax ? Reason I ask is that they both effect hair dif, J's head hair started growing back quite quickly when she started Tax, she was a peach within 6 weeks but her eyebrows and eyelashes fell out as soon as the Tax got into her system. Keep us up to speed with how you are getting along Gillie so we can help you along and don't \"put up\" with any side effects that are getting you down mention it to your onco team as there are remedies for all the baggage that chemo brings. Just treat chemo as your friend. Best wishes and good luck for the coming week, George & Jackie. ",

Some days you'll be able to go up a gear and, move over and do some overtaking on other days you'll just cough and splutter and no matter how hard you put your foot down nothing much happens, and if it does you soon end up having a rest in the nearest lay-by :-( Think you are suffering a bit of fatigue, so I'll stick in the link to Maccy info page about that just to see if it helps you get your head around the total body tiredness thing.

If you are larger breasted they will mostly offer you a reduction on your good side. There are a couple of reasons for this. They tend not to perform large reconstructions because of either not enough tissue for flap types from the donor site plus it makes the reconstruction heavy pulling on sutures with the possibilty of complications and taking longer to heal. I'm uncertain as to what size the implant type of recons can safely be expanded to ? If this reduction is OK'd they may do it at the same time, but could also want you to wait to see what size your reconstruction ends up at post surgery to gauge the amount of reduction needed for symmetry at a later date ? If this reduction isn't mentioned do ask about it. Without this you will be left  a bit 'unbalanced' Maybe those who have had recon's could comment about size and balance and offer some advice ?

Which is a good thing as there is always someone at the same stage of treatment that you can share with and of course advice and support from those who have been there, done that :) They can only tell so much from scans and biopsies - It's not until any removed tissue is examined in the pathology lab and you get their report through you get all the finer details of your diagnosis. Some of these tests like HER2 can take around 10 days. Most find they get nearly all their pathology information a bit sooner but still have to wait a few extra days for the HER2 findings. This is used by your MDT (multi disciplinary team) to work out a personal treatment plan. Like will you need chemo, radiotherapy and if you need long term hormone inhibitor tablets ? In a word yes things change, and often do,  tumour sizes can be found to be different and also the grade can change up or down. There is always something they can still offer you. Once you get this information and know how this is going to pan out you can cope much better as it gives you something to focus on rather than all this waiting and worrying on the full results period. Please don't get distressed over another couple of weeks wait, nothing drastic is going to occur as a result of a the extra wait. Try to do enjoyable things in this quiet time in the run up to surgery, rather than worrying about what if's and things you can't change :) Take care, G n' J",

R1 & R2 are fairly new radio products and have now been made available on prescription so if you can't get these from the rads unit, do see your GP to grab some (gotta love free prescriptions) R1 is used straight after each session and R2 during the evening and for 14 days after your sessions end. Another which can help cool but not help with any burning is 90% Aloe Vera from the fridge but if you can get r1 and r2 you shouldn't need that. Similarly if you can't get the r1 & r2 and you do start to get a bit of burning something like Flammazine would help. Also do check out with your hospital about parking. Most offer free daily parking for Rads patients, either in the way of a free swipe ticket or refunding parking costs after treatment. You could check this online, you will need to present your appointments schedule letter to confirm this so you could ask at the desk when you go for your pre-rads appointment. G n' J",

IDC is the most common type of breast cancer so has plenty of successful treatments to get you free of this pesky invader and has a 90% recovery rate. The other 10% are those found really advanced, elderly or have underlying health issues that eliminate most of the treatment options. No doubt you have lots of what if questions that have popped up since getting through the emotional waiting results period, so fire away - We're all here to help and there are loads of us here all at various stages of treatment. You could have a look through this 'Invasive Ductal Carcinoma' booklet to get an idea of what may lie ahead but do take all this one step at a time to avoid getting information overload. You can save this to your device if you find it helpful. You only really need to know about what the first stage of your treatment regime will be. That could be surgery, or in some cases chemotherapy is offered prior to surgery to shrink things down to minimise surgery. Chances are being stage and grade 2 it may well be surgery first - Is your next appointment with a surgeon or oncologist as this would be a clue ? Anything goes here from typing the fear or anger out to getting friendly, honest replies and sharing the things that make us laugh. You can do this, hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Evening Macrad Thanks for checking it out and commenting. It's great to get some input from those with experience in the field :) There seems to be a lot of positive outcomes from those that have used R1 & R2 either through prescription or buying over the counter. Hopefully as more evidence is gathered it will either be generally accepted as fit for purpose or not. I think a lot more info could be gathered if Rad units did follow up exams post treatment to check on post rads effects depending on which product is given or used. Don't know if this is still the norm but in our case post rads (Oct 2012) there was no other radiology appointment to check on healing progress or after effects - So unless there is substantial burning or lung clipping damage it would seem there was no direct info being fed back on patients aftercare to the radiology unit. Getting Flamazine and anything else was done via GP. At the pre-rads appt Jackie asked about cream and was just told to buy any aqueous cream or something like E45 as they didn't supply any - also we got no information about how or when to use it either. Hopefully things have changed in those 3+ years :) Thanks a bunch, G n' J",

If however during treatment your herceptin gets put on 'hold' for whatever reason as the herceptin is only licensed by NICE for one year and that year runs out any remaining doses won't be funded unless you are metastatic (secondaries) J had a 2 week break for heart muscle recovery about halfway though her herceptin so wasn't allowed the last dose as her year was up.

      "Content": "Evening Sally,  Sorry to see you here, really knocks you sideways when you get diagnosed eh :-( When you say Oestrogen and HER2 free you mean ER and HER2 negative ? Have they mentioned PR (progesterone) negative as well or are you unsure about that one. If you are negative for all three that is known as Triple Negative, and as you say the hormone targeted tablets will be of no use because they are taken to counter receptors that feed off your own hormones only if you are positive for ER or PR likewise (Herceptin is for HER2+ only) These are not the HRT tablets you are thinking of, these hormone targeted tablets do not replace hormones they actively reduce hormones to a level where they starve the cancer cells of food. If it turns out you are Triple Neg there is an Macmillan info page here. Obviously bon't bother reading it until you know either way. It's there if you need it. Have they given you a stage/grade from histology of the lump removed or are you still waiting results from that ? In a sentinel node check, taken from nearest the lump chances are it was the nearest one with some cells in it. The others to be taken will give a much clearer picture as to if it has spread to these or not but for obvious reasons they have to be looked at. It's the nodes job to trap these cells and produce antibodies so they were doing their job. That is why you will have to be careful to not injure that arm after removal as your antibody producing nodes that side will be gone and infections in that arm can be a problem. You are not even allowed blood pressure cuff to be used or blood taken for testing (no needles)  from that arm afterwards. So always offer your good side arm. There is a lot going on at the moment for you to get your head around, once some sort of treatment plan is in place you can take it one step at a time.  As for your hockey, can't see any reason why you couldn't get back into it, but you only you will be able see if you are up to your usual fitness post treatment and can still give it your all. Take care Sally, keep posting, there's no such thing as a silly question. George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Morning Andrea, Sorry this is a quick answer as I have to go to work. This sounds like hand foot syndrome also known as Palmar Plantar. There is some info about it here.  It's chemo damage to the capillaries in your hands and feet. Try not to rub or massage them as more pressure can make it worse. Please let your onco unit know about this and see your gp to get some medication to ease the pain. Hopefully you'll get some more answers as it is fairly common with Tax they may reduce your last dose a bit to help lessen the effects which will help. Lowering the dose 20% or so won't put you at any risk. Take care, George & Jackie P.S.  Back home now so I can give this some more time. As you are finding this is a very painful condition and the more you walk or handle things the worse it seems to get as it spreads the residue chemo about damaging more capilleries. So try to avoid anything that causes friction to hands or feet. The best info page I found that can be easily understood (medical jargon Huh) is the american cancer.net info site. A lot go into detail about what is and how it is caused but only this one seems to give you helpful things to do the ease it. You can find that here. Hope this helps, like I said do mention it to your onco team and your gp as you may need him/her if they think vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) would help which has to be prescribed. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya,  Well apart from the constant battle between constipation and the opposite during chemo Jackie's biggest problem was taste issues rather than foods giving her stomach ache. Everything tasted 'Tinny' or like cardboard so she only craved highly flavoured foods like chilli and curry based meals with rice or pasta. Which we probably lived on for around 6 months, none of which caused any problems or reflux.  Some things fell by the wayside, even now 30 months on she still cannot eat milk chocolate or drink coffee but dark chocolate is def now on the menu :-) If reflux is a problem you didn't have before it may be worth asking about it - If it caused by heartburn (or reflux) which can be a side effect of cancer treatment there are several dif tablets that could help Some tips to help try and reduce heartburn are - Limit your caffeine intake \u2013 for example, reduce canned drinks, coffee, chocolate and tea Raise the head of your bed when sleeping or lying down, or higher pillows. Don't eat for 2 or 3 hours before going to bed Reduce fatty foods in your diet, such as deep fried foods Avoid foods and drinks that may cause heartburn, such as citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits), mints and alcohol  Get some anti heartburn tablets prescribed from your doctor but let them know if they are not helping as there are several types you can try. Doesn't say anything about reducing cake intake LOL Cakes are the new flowers, so tell all your friends to  - :-)   G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Bandele, This info is routinely handed out to patients in Canada and the US, so I'm wondering if you are across the 'Big Pond' or if the NHS in the UK has started giving this helpful advice also ?  If this is the same info, it only applies to the first 48 hours after the session :) Information regarding bodily fluids - Does it read something like this.... ? How can I protect myself and those I live with while I\u2019m getting chemo? There are many things you can do during and after chemo to keep yourself and your loved ones from being affected by the chemo drugs while your body is getting rid of them. It takes about 48 hours for your body to break down and/or get rid of most chemo drugs. Most of the waste comes out in your body fluids \u2013 urine, stool, tears, and vomit. The drugs are also in your blood. When chemo drugs get outside your body, they can harm or irritate skin \u2013 yours or even other people\u2019s. Keep in mind that this means toilets can be a hazard for children and pets, and it\u2019s important to be careful. Talk to your doctor about these and any other precautions you should follow. During \u2013 and for 48 hours after \u2013 chemo: \u2022 Flush the toilet twice after you use it. Put the lid down before flushing to avoid splashing. If possible, you may want to use a separate toilet during this time. If this is not possible, wear gloves to clean the toilet seat after each use. \u2022 Both men and women should sit on the toilet to use it. This cuts down on splashing. \u2022 Always wash your hands with warm water and soap after using the toilet. Dry your hands with paper towels and throw them away. \u2022 If you vomit into the toilet, clean off all splashes and flush twice. If you vomit into a bucket or basin, carefully empty it into the toilet without splashing the contents and flush twice. Wash out the bucket with hot, soapy water and rinse it, emptying the wash and rinse water into the toilet, then flushing it. Dry the bucket with paper towels and throw them away. \u2022 Caregivers should wear 2 pairs of throw-away gloves if they need to touch any of your body fluids. (These can be bought in most drug stores.) They should always wash their hands with warm water and soap afterward \u2013 even if they had gloves on. \u2022 If a caregiver does come in contact with any of your body fluids, they should wash the area very well with warm water and soap. It\u2019s not likely to cause any harm, but try to take extra care to avoid this. At your next visit, let your doctor know this happened. Being exposed often may lead to problems, and extra care should be taken to avoid this. \u2022 Any clothes or sheets that have body fluids on them should be washed in your washing machine \u2013 not by hand. Wash them in warm water with regular laundry detergent. Do not wash them with other clothes. If they cannot be washed right away, seal them in a plastic bag. Hugs, G n' J",

I don't think the side effects from these are any better or worse than any of the other Oestrogen inhibitor tablets. Everyone gets differing issues from these AI's so until they get into your system you will be playing a bit of a guessing game. Jackie is halfway through 5 years of Letrozole and for her the biggest issue is osteopenia and joint pain.

At first it's \" Do what you think I need to get this out of me\"  then after a while you see what surgery has done to you and remember how you looked before reality hits home and you have to \"deal with it\" mentally and physically. There is a Macmillan book titled \"Body Image & Cancer\" which may help you come to terms with your thoughts. It deals with all cancers including breast so may be a worthwhile read until you get some more replies to help you through this. Take care, Stumble, it's just a blip honest, George & Jackie.",

Before I started I was terrified I would get all the side effects listed on the info sheets I was given.   <\/p> <p> As it was I was relatively lucky so to speak, I did get very tired which got a bit worse with each one, the 4th being the worst. The horrible mouth feeling and lack of taste, seemed to live off ice lollies &amp; tomato soup for days. I had all sorts of different things to drink. <\/p> <p> I only got a short period of joint pain a few days after the 1st, could be because I only had the one injection 24 hours after chemo for the White blood cells. <\/p> <p> Apart from Imodium a couple of times, I didn&#39;t need any extra medication. <\/p> <p> <\/p> <p> It is a shock to find out you need chemo, my biopsy results were 44mm of DCIS with a suspicion of a micro invasion.

      "Content": "Hiya Jrip, There are quite a few TNBC ladies in the breast group - You will gradually get to meet them through posting questions while getting settled in here. TN is a bit of as bummer as it mostly affects younger women but there are members here with TN leading almost normal lives (no-one is completely normal after being diagnosed with any type of BC) and have learnt to just be aware of anything that doesn't feel 'right' but are years past original diagnosis. Just make sure you don't miss todays sunshine worrying about tomorrows rain. It's so easy to let this take over your life and worry yourself into meltdown for most this is do'able so don't let it make you a prisoner. If the T takes a dislike to you it can be a tough regime but you may not get clobbered so hard next time. Keep an eye on your temps and aware of bugs during the middle week when your white cell count is at it's lowest to lessen the risk. Easier said than done as most of the bugs which infect you are from yourself (mostly oral thrush thanks to the steroids) :-( Hope this helps, take care, G n' J",

Her2+ means you will probably be given Herceptin which in our case was 18 x 3 weekly. So it's about a year of treatment. Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody ( targeted drug ) About one in five breast tumours are her2+ so there are plenty of us around to ask about stuff. Macmillan have an info page dealing with Her2 you can find it here. http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Breast/Aboutbreastcancer/Typesandrelatedconditions/HER2%20positive.aspx If after reading it you have further Q's fire away, we're all yours.

So if you can get Femara (Letrozole) - Arimidex (Anastrazole) or Nolvadex (Tamoxifen) written up on your repeat you shouldn't be given a generic  :) It's the same with the R1 and R2 Radiotherapy gels - some can get it easily while others are told NO  because it's a one off payment of £70 compared to £5 for a tub of axle grease  :( Take care, G n' J",

Depending on whether you have a few nodes taken (Sentinel Node Biopsy) to check those first or want to have all nodes removed, do get an agreement that you will have regular MRI's or at the very least ultrasound scans to check to see if your primary later becomes visible. There has also been occult cases where after pathology checking the nodes the cells found are HER2+ positive which will then mean Herceptin. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Sam, Sorry to see you joining us here and reading about your mum. This is always a tough decision to make - Most would probably go for the mastectomy to be certain all suspect tissue is removed but it is a very personal choice. No doubt it is emotionally hard looking down and seeing where your breast used to be but there are reconstruction types she could possibly have if she wished and if her team are willing - ok it's not the same but it gives shape but they don't always reconstruct at the same time, especially if they feel radiotherapy will be offered at a later date. Chances are if she has lumpectomy number 2 she will be quite mis-shapen post op anyway :-(   A lot depends on her age and if she feels this is a threat to her finding happiness with another fella somewhere down the line or whether it's the surgery itself she has problems with.  If it is the former anyone she 'meets' who is worth getting to know better will accept her as she is - we all carry some 'baggage' as we get older :-) You may find this website helps - It's the BresDex info pages for making choices about breast surgery put together by several university teaching hospitals. No doubt some of the other lovely ladies will reply explaining what choices they made and why, which will also help a lot. One thing that has crossed my mind is, seeing as you mum has had her ovaries removed has she been asked about having the BRCA gene test ? and have any other members of her immediate family had problems with breast or ovarian or the men with prostate cancer previously ? Keep posting and if you have other questions about either surgery option, fire away. We're all here to help. Edit - See Mistlymoley has mentioned Keepingabreast - thanks for that {hug} - Click the link to read their reconstruction page. Take care, George & Jackie",

Problem is no one finds out if they are ER/PR+ positive until after they are already diagnosed. Wouldn't it be great if a simple blood test to find this risk out earlier in life was found - it would make deciding about hormone based therapies of any kind safer to know if you were at risk.... ?

      "Content": "Hi Aneesa1  No doubt you are more than a little apprehensive about what you are facing, most here will tell you it can be tough at times but is do'able you just have to not keep secrets about any side effects so you find out how to ease them and to try and buy a few basics before you start to give you a quick fix without having to trawl around a supermarket when you feel knackered. I'll list a few items hopefully others here will reply and add to it :) Something for constipation and diarrhoea as one can quickly turn into the other - definitely a cheap'ish digital thermometer - ginger nut and arrowroot biscuits - a few bottles of multibuy flavoured water (still or fizzy) - Ibuprofen (don't have to be branded ones) & paracetamol, so you can alternate between the two - Tin of pineapple chunks (honestly) - Chlorhexidine mouthwash - Bicarbonate of soda - soft babies toothbrush. These may seem really random but are cheap enough and better to have them handy if needed as they all serve a purpose :) Assuming you will have the 3 x FEC (3 different drugs given together) part first and then herceptin injections will start when you switch to the T part. All these are given at 3 weekly intervals, so you can forget about the T and herceptin for a while. If you can try to fit in a dental check prior to starting chemo, but explain to the dentist you are going to be having chemotherapy, so definitely no drilling or extractions as this will push back starting chemo - and no flossing during chemo either. Last thing you want is a mouth infection starting :( Don't know if you are aware but with a cancer diagnosis you get all prescriptions free for 5 years, so see your GP about getting an exemption form sent off. It is a stressy time, but honestly facing this is a lot worse in your head than the reality on the day you start. Has your oncologist mentioned anything about fitting a PICC Line or Portacth in your arm for chemo ? Some health authorities do this as standard, others can be persuaded if you have small veins - do they normally have problems getting blood samples from you ? I seem to have rattled on a bit, but you have a couple of weeks to take all this in. Hope it is of some help, if it raises any questions, just reply someone will know the answer :) Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi jemilyxx  OK, this isn't the news you were both hoping for, but it is what it is - so be reassured her team have decided this is the best, albeit tough way for her to kick cancer where it hurts. Was this decision made from her lymph node results or for another reason like being classed as HER2+ positive for instance - could you also mention which type of breast cancer they say it is as that can play a part on whether surgery or chemo first may be better for her  ? Several ladies here have had the surgery part first then found from tissue tests to not need chemo afterall, that's why it helps to know why they have suggested it. Chemo first is usually to shrink tumours down to minimise surgery which can mean a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy but that isn't always the case. If a mastectomy is needed that is usually carried out prior to chemo. Have they mentioned which type of surgery your mum will be having if she opts for surgery first ? There is a lot of hype regarding chemo and being permanently sick, some types of chemotherapy are more prone to making you feel nauseous that others. Most of the time it is controlled so you only feel sick without it actually happening, if you are actually sick there are better meds they can give to avoid this happening next time around. Years ago it was always surgery first but now at at a guesstimate I would say around 60% are given surgery first (termed adjuvant) leaving 40% having chemo prior to surgery (termed neo-adjuvant) ? but these figures could be for varying reasons :-/ The protection against recurrence is around the same for either method, so there is a lot of information to gather to be able to make the best individual decision. Hope this has helped rather than confusing you even further ? Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning  Anne,  Just wanted to add to the good advice already posted, but from a different angle. You haven't said what chemo regime they are giving you. FEC only, FEC+T or another combo ?  Reason for asking is that you may feel work is more do'able if you are on FEC maybe only working part time as it isn't so harsh on your joints/muscles as Taxane based chemo but side effects can be accumulative -It's all very hard trying to pre-empt the outcome as (you know what is coming here) \"Everyone is Different\"..... Some find their first chemo session is the worst, and side effects apart from the sicky feeling bearable, others are not so lucky.  If you are going the FEC+T route and you do work during your FEC part be prepared for feeling more wiped out by midday and whole body tiredness during the Tax stage and expect to have the odd duvet day on the sofa. You may find Tax better than FEC, only time will tell. Considering your type of work you would be better not working at all during the second week when your white count is really low on \"ANY\" chemo as the last place you would want to be is in a school full of snotty winter bug laden children. It would be like walking blindfolded through a minefield. If you pick up a bug when neutropenic (week two) you will be spending up to a week as an inpatient on iv drips and antibiotics...... Even something as minor as oral thrush can take over what is left of your depleted immune system and floor you, so, (not trying to scare you here) but be careful at this time. If needs must, try and arrange for work you can do at home during that period. Also take full advantage of family and friends offering, \"read\" (press ganged) into becoming your domestic slaves, it will free up some of your energy to put to good use recovering. Now, tell that cancer to bend over and give it a Damn Good Spanking  :-)   George & Jackie ",

Could be a cyst, calcification, benign piece of tissue. Main thing is you didn't ignore it and you are on track to get it diagnosed. Depending on your age and how dense your beast tissue is you are more likely to have an Ultrasound scan but they may do both with the mammogram done first - I will warn you first off - they will probably take biopsies while using the US scanner but this still doesn't mean anything sinister. It just means what they are seeing needs checking out further. Then you have to endure the terrible waiting results stage which can really do your head in unless you can find things to do and places to go to take your mind off it all. Here's a read for some info about breast screening units and biopsies so you don't get any unexpected surprises. Just click the green text link. Do keep posting so we can help you with the emotional side of all this is it or isn't it worries and please don't google too much - A lot of the info out there is either way out of date or very misleading. Afraid at the moment it's a case of hope for the best but your biggest problem at this time will be keeping this a 'secret' from your son until you know more about what you are dealing with without him realising something is going on - he's bound to notice subtle changes. If you do decide to inform him this guide may be helpful in getting the conversation started 'Talking to Children and Teenagers When an Adult has Cancer'  Please realise this is for those diagnosed but this isn't you - and hopefully won't be.

Macmillan has an information page about Hormonal Therapy Tablets here - Do select the 'Read The Details' button to open the page right up. Here is a list of all the registered make and 'branded' makers of these tablets. This is by no means a complete list as trade names vary throughout the world and there are just too many but does contain the more common brands available in the UK Tamoxifen.... Nolvadex ® Astra-Zeneca original maker. Arrow - Bayer - Merck - Mylan - Orion - Sandoz - Schering - Teva - Wockhardt Anastrozole.... Arimidex ®  Astra Zeneca original maker. Arrow - Accord - Activis - Aventis - Cipla - Sandoz - Teva - Zentiva Letrozole.... Femara ® Novartis original maker. Accord - Activis - Arrow - Orion - Sandoz* - Teva * (note Sandoz is also owned by Novartis)  Exemestane.... Aromasin ® Pfizer original maker. Accord - Actavis - Arrow - Aventis - Ranbaxy - Sandoz - Teva In most cases the original make does tend to have less 'baggage' but everyone is different so this may not be the case for you. However the originals are always more expensive so unless the original name is on your repeat (i.e. Femara instead of Letrozole) your pharmacy can give out any of the cheaper versions as they go by the drug name. Good luck finding a friend amongst this lot. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Paige, So sorry to read about your mum but you have found yourself in a great place at a tough time. Hope the chemo was kind to your mum, that can be an ordeal in itself ? Her scans will be to see how the chemo has acted on her tumours prior to determine other treatment or surgery. If they have shrunk significantly they may offer a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy but don't rely on this as we don't know the extent of her lobular type. The chemo will also have had some effect on her ovary and bone spread but an I correct in assuming the chemo was mainly to treat the breast tumours ? When you say lobular and ductal are these in the same breast or lobular in one and ductal in the other and now her chemo has finished what other treatment in the form of tablets perhaps is she taking. Sorry this sounds like a game of twenty questions, but the treatment options are so many and varied we can help you better if we know what she is taking. You are correct in saying hormone receptive is a good thing but it will most probably mean your mum having to take a daily tablet long term to keep her oestrogen/progesterone levels minimal - Has her team mentioned anything about her HER2 status, if your mum is HER2+ if she is she may need Herceptin as well. Do get back to us, we're all here to help where we can. Take care, George & Jackie",

The side effects are very similar to Taxotere aka Docetaxel but to a slightly lesser extent. Having said that because they are weekly they can get a bit accumulative with less time spent for recovery between your chemo sessions. The main thing that takes most by surprise is the tiredness. Great to read you have been given a port,  it makes the sessions quicker and far less hassle. Have you done the pre-chemo shopping aids thing yet.

Had the previous remover completely dried before re-applying, or you been using bleach, oven cleaner anything containing harsh chemicals beforehand ?  Sounds like one of the pigments leached out. Did you use a different varnish remover to last time ?

It's the idea that they somehow almost make you feel guilty or inadequate if you cannot afford to do it their way which isn't very nice :( Most of us when diagnosed have more concerns about still having enough money coming in during treatment to pay the bills if you can't work for six months and have to go onto SSP or cap in hand to the benefits office to those who are single parents with young children or on a pension and can ill afford any extra expense. It pains me to see these more affluent patients advising expensive ways of easing treatment side effects when some are trying really hard just to keep a roof over their heads, stay warm in winter and put food on the table. To those promoting the book they have just written about it all at a time when a majority just want to get through it with their mojo intact and hopefully enough spare cash for a week away to recuperate/celebrate.  Not knocking cancer books but the better ones tend to be written by people who don't have the connections to push sales, or are 'free to read' blogs.

The surgery has removed the tumour and like you say the rest is for mopping up any stragglers. Your lymphs were clear so chances are you are too. The rest is insurance against recurrence, it takes ages for any cells to develop into a cluster so even what seems like forever to you is still within guidelines.  it's a PITA really, just adds to the time you get to worry about what treatment lies ahead when all you want to do is get on with it. Try to enjoy the break with family and friends, do stuff and go places to try and take your mind off it. Once the assessment is done you will soon be back on the Runaway Mine Cart.

If it turns out to be a tissue problem, being tissue it will be treatable/operable. If I remember rightly you are not triple neg, so did you ever have chemo or was it surgery , rads and hormone tablets ?

      "Content": "Morning  Gillie,  Good for you, you have made a great start but nicotine plays with your brain a tad when you stop smoking. That little voice on your shoulder saying \" well one won't hurt will it \"  :-) We were both long time smokers ( roll your own type ) until like you cancer and chemo makes you take stock of your lifestyles. With taste buds doing their own thing during chemo it may be the best time to quit especially if they taste foul, but a lot suffer so much hassle and stress it is the worst time for them and find they need the crutch of a ciggy now and then to help them chill out. When we first stopped we used a couple of those refillable / rechargeable Exhale e-cigs ( type CE5 ) as a stop gap to give us the nicotine we craved while not getting all the tar and chemicals from cigarettes. The fluid comes in loads of flavours and has varying strengths of nicotine content right down to nicotine free. If you can go a couple of weeks before caving in to cigarettes then a low dose would suit you fine and it certainly does takes the edge off.  You can easily find exhale-uk through google if you want to check them out but if you feel you are so close to being able to do this unaided, then bite the bullet and go for it. I just checked they are still online and see their CE5 starter kit is on a special offer until the 28th. With us both being smokers we put the money aside each week and we have saved over £1200 since Christmas - It's amazing to see it mounting up and makes you realise how much smoking actually costs in money and health. Good luck but don't beat yourself up if you lapse, you will get there in the end.... George & Jackie.  ",

      "Content": "Morning Charly,  All these hormone reducing tablets come with baggage and although if you read the package leaflet they all state roughly the same shedload of side effects you \"could\" get, what they don't tell you is that these can vary by quite a lot between different medications. It's common for doctors to change from Tamoxifen to Aromasin after 2 or 3 years as \"the figures\" state there is a better chance of reducing re-occurance by changing. What they don't tell you is by how much of a % it is better, or take into account the fact that everyone is different and what might mean 5% for one person may only be 1% for another. Mood swings, PMT type symptoms,  sleeplessness and fatigue all add up, no wonder you are noticing a change it must be a bitch for your wife waking up feeling 80 every day. If you are both unhappy with the way things are going think you both ought to see your GP and explain the problems since going on Aromasin and ask if it is really worth all these extra hassles for the sake of what may be a low percentage of advantage and get back onto the Tamoxifen or even ask if there is another alternative tablet that does the same job to try out. She may just end up swapping one set of side effects for another though. At the end of the day she has another 3 years to go so it makes sense to make those 3 years as do'able as possible. Don't just go along with it, if you don't tell gp's about problems they will think she is ok on them and nothing will change. Hope this helps, best wishes to you both,  George & Jackie.",

Don't know how long post surgery you are assuming your reconstruction was carried out after your chemo etc. So this could be nerve damage from surgery or seeing as it's affecting both hands, peripheral neuropathy from the chemo. Are your feet affected at all ? Either way do try to get in to see about it - the sooner you get it checked out the sooner you can get something to ease it. G n' J",

Please be assured that after chemo and surgery the cancer will be gone and the rads are just a bit more insurance against recurrence that's all. When you say you had a bone scan was it a 40 minute Dexa scan or the longer 3-4 hour nuclear scan ? I'm thinking it was the first one which is usually carried out if you are going to be placed on hormone inhibitor tablets later ? If it was a dexa scan don't fret all they are checking for is bone density figures which will be monitored if you do get placed on the tablets. Has it been mentioned to you that you are ER/PR+ positive ? because if you are that will mean you getting these. Fingers crossed they can get on top of this necrosis without the need for yet more surgery, I'm thinking you feel you have been through enough already. There are few ladies here who have had necrosis problems hopefully they will notice your message and reply. Take care, G n' J",

As for things changing, yes the pathology results do tend to get tweaked when they can take a better look at any removed tissue. They find things like if you are HER2 positive up or down grade and of course the size - yours will be much smaller after having chemo or hormone inhibitor tablets to shrink it. Radiotherapy isn't anywhere near as bad as you may be imagining - any particular reason for thinking about avoiding it ?

      "Content": "Morning Coastal-lady  Please don't have a knee jerk reaction and get your tablet brand changed from Arimidex anytime soon... I think Lynn / Kacang is taking Arimidex and may be able to help ? Arimidex is the original registered maker of Anastrozole and considered the best (and most expensive) for minimal side effects. This rib pain could be down to the tablets or lack of oestrogen from them but if so you may well be getting joint pain and aches in other places too ? You mention being back at work on a phased return and also driving with long car journeys - Could this rib pain be caused by a shift in the way you actually sit now post surgery (a posture thing - slumped forward a little in chairs) coupled with the car seat belt ? or even down to a chest muscle / rib strain rather than anything sinister ? Most Occy health folks are pro-employer,  totally clueless about long term cancer issues and have no personal experience of cancer to draw on so that comment doesn't surprise me in the slightest. Think the best way forward would to contact your BCN first rather than GP and see what they recommend. if your BCN was a bit useless then go the GP route and get this looked into. If this pain is near the centre of the chest (ribs) and seemed to move from left to right it could be the lack of oestrogen is affecting the costocartilages which is the cartilage either side of the sternum like it affects other joints? OK i've run out of ideas now :)  Hope you find a unworrying (is that a word) answer to this soon and a simple fix to ease it. Take care, G n' J",

I don't really understand what is meant by controlling your metastatic load because according to your TNM you have M0 which is no mets  ?  It's as if they have you confused with someone else - Is it definitely your name, date of birth and patient number etc on the letter ? Have you had any surgery yet, or is all this information from the preliminary scans and biopsies ? If you are HER2+ positive then you will be given Herceptin and this is only ever given in conjunction with chemotherapy - You won't be offered Herceptin on it's own as it only licensed to be used with chemo. Because you will need to have Herceptin for a whole year 18 x 3 weekly sessions it is common to have surgery first, then chemo and herceptin start a few weeks post surgery. I'll add more to this reply in the morning but for now this is some info on the breast cancer TNM scale from Cancer Research UK I'm sure you will get more replies to this as what they have told you doesn't really make much sense. If you have trouble understanding your consultant phone their secretary or your breast care nurse (I assume you have been assigned one) and get them to explain the letter a section at a time and where you are being referred to next (surgery or oncology) as you need to know what is happening next regarding treatment and when it is likely to start.

You'll just have to spend a little more time with us misfits to help you get through this, and you will :) Group Hugs Suzy, G n' J",

This will mean about 6 hours in theatre and a good 6 to 8 weeks recovery (at least) possibly even 3 months. I'm sorry to be the bearer of news that you probably didn't want to hear but you need to know this. There is no way you could carry on as normal soon after surgery, and you shouldn't feel expected too. Time to put yourself first for a change, because you are worth it. There is more info about LD flap recons here - select the 'read the details' button to open the page right up. Be aware it contains a couple of post surgery images though. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Bushy, Welcome to a great place at a scary time for you. It's more likely the thought of you having a couple of days delay was the straw the broke the camels back. This teary session was something that was bound to happen sooner or later as there is a limit to how much emotional pressure you can take in without your safety valve blowing or you would crack up completely. You are at the stage everyone here hated - waiting results is a nightmare and seems to take forever. It may only be a couple of days but in this situation 2 days seem like 2 weeks :-( Don't ever feel the need to say sorry here, it's a great place for a good rant, bin kicking and getting it all out in the open. There may not be much of a delay because all these scan type images are digital now and everyone who needs to see them can just access them from their hospital computer. I assume your husband knows but your son doesn't as yet then ?  Please don't feel the need to keep the fact you have been crying from your husband at least it shows how worried you are - so many people when asked say I'm fine when really they are feeling in bits - It's a shame everyone feels the need to be strong towards the rest of their family when at this time it surely needs to be the other way round. Don't know how old your son is but he probably will have guessed something isn't 'right' kids pick up on all the changes and little signs more than we think they would. No doubt you have a head full of questions (no such thing as a silly question) so do please ask. We all know exactly how you are feeling at the moment and there are loads of us here to help.

Ductal is one of the more common types to be labelled with; 2cm is about average when first noticed as smaller lumps tend to go unoticed hiding amongst the tissue unless your breasts are small sized. This is so'ooo treatable - BC these days has a huge arsenal of varying treatment options which are now tailored exactly to your diagnosis and pathology lab results - Recovery rates for BC is over 90% and of the other 10%  being found at a very advanced stage and not being able to have some treatments like chemo because of frailty, or underlying health issues play a big part in this. Have you been given any other information about who you will be seeing next, surgeon or possibly oncologist ? My wife was diagnosed May 2012 and we're still happily kicking around she was still 'No Evidence of Disease' at her 6 year review.

You probably still have collateral damage from the chemo and it takes ages to get anywhere near to feeling your new normal but it does def get better honestly. The Herceptin as you are probably finding is a lot more doable than chemo, it just seems to go on forever until number 18 but the Tamoxifen like all these hormone tabs comes with baggage ( a wide and varying collection of side effects ) anyone of which can affect you. The lack of oestrogen can lead to being osteopenic so ask about getting a Dexa scan if you start getting really bad bone / joint pain in your hips, legs, knees, shoulders etc. They can give you tabs to help build up calcium and strengthen bones etc if the scan shows you need help to ward off osteoporosis in later life. Open a bottle and top up that half full glass of yours and we'll toast your happy future, 'cause you do have one, your'e just having trouble seeing it with those hurdles in the way :-) Best Wishes,    George & Jackie.",

      "Content": "Hi tammj  Warm welcome to the club no one wanted to join - Hopefully yours will be a short stay. Everyone here will agree the waiting results period is a very tough time on the emotions, you try to hope for the best but those what if thoughts scare the pants off everybody. If only these professional people would realise finding out over the phone (even if it is bad news) is so much easier to cope with mentally than all this drawn out waiting time :( Though your appointment is with a surgeon this could be a benign lump that needs removing as even benign lumps grow and require surgery. Nearly all breast lumps (cancer included) are fairly slow growing so you would be unlikely to notice any changes over a month or so. There are government targets for treatment - 2 weeks maximum between a GP referring you and being seen by the breast unit - The current treatment targets are No more than 2 months wait between the date the hospital receives an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer and starting treatment Starting treatment no more than 31 days after the meeting at which you and your doctor agree the treatment plan Must admit I'm a little surprised they didn't call you back to discuss the results of the biopsies before getting a surgeon on the scene. It may be there is some information you haven't received - You could see your GP and ask if any information has been forwarded to them from the hospital ? I was like your husband when my wife was diagnosed nearly 5 years ago now - it's like someone set off a cluster grenade inside your head - you are lost, confused, angry, scared and in disbelief this could actually be happening to you :( No amount of worrying will alter the outcome, you just have to keep those fingers tightly crossed. One thing is for sure once you see the surgeon things usually happen quickly and that can come as a bit of a shock after all the waiting. Over the next 10 days do things, go places, chuck yourself into a hobby in fact anything that takes your minds off clock watching and over thinking things. Hope this is of some help at a tough time, fingers crossed for you both, G n' J",

There is a very active monthly Chemo Club within the Main Breast Group you should check out and get involved with - It has a chemo tips link in the very first message. You can find the June Chemo Club clicking here. The main items to get hold of are something for both constipation and diarrhoea as one can quickly turn to the other :-/ A digital thermometer (doesn't have to be a really expensive one) We used a cheapo from Asda which we found accurate enough. A packet of Ginger Nut and Arrowroot biscuits they both help in different ways - Ginger Nuts help with taste issues and Arrowroot with nausea or queasiness.  Generic brands of Paracetamol and Ibuprofen because if needed you can alternate between the two at 2 hourly intervals instead of just 4 hourly with paracetamol only - Don't double up with any other tablets that may also contain paracetamol like Co-codamol though... Supermarket multi buys of various bottled flavoured waters (still or fizzy) as you need at least 2 litres of fluid daily while on chemo as Tea / Coffee may taste awful... Soft (baby) toothbrush in case your gums get sore and some Chlorhexidine antibacterial mouthwash - Lloyds, Superdrug and Boots all sell their own brand at a round £3 a bottle to help avert oral thrush. Tin of Pineapple Chunks which you can open and put in the fridge in case you need to sooth your mouth. Are you having 4 x EC only or switching to something else like Taxotere afterwards ?

      "Content": "Hiya, Welcome to the group - This is going to take a bit of untangling, so bear with us a bit.... So your nan has had the BRCA test and has been told she carries the gene mutation - Do you know if this is for BRCA1 or BRCA2 ?  and you don't want to stress your mum to get the test done for herself at the moment ? I assume your nan with BC is your mum's mum not your dad's mum ? There is an online risk assessment tool here you can use but you will need family information to enter to get an accurate reading. Click this link to take the OPERA Test. What you need to know (and possibly enter) is any incidences of Breast or Ovarian cancer in any of the ladies and Breast or Prostate cancer in the males within your immediate family group. By this I mean parents, grand parents, all of your sisters and brothers, aunties, uncles, nieces and nephews. The information can then be noted or printed off and taken to your GP to back up any need you may require to be put forward for BRCA testing. I'm not saying you need to worry, but you do need to know your risks and if you need to be tested. Any incidences of the above cancers in relatives get a score which is used to either put you forward for the test or not. Just because your mum hasn't had breast cancer doesn't mean she doesn't carry the gene mutation as it is possible to be brca 1 or 2 and not get cancer. If anyone has the brca mutation there is a 50% chance of passing it down. So your mum may not have it ? There is more information here about Gene Faults and cancer at Cancer Research UK. You could just try mentioning the test again after Christmas in a casual manner just to test for her reaction and if you get no positive answer from her tell her of the worries you are all facing by not knowing. Hope this helps for now, if you need any more information just reply back. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Evening  Gillie,  Nails are a bit like hair. Some folks take a bad hit and others seem to have only minor problems with either. Trouble it is like the chemo and the cold cap you don't know until you try these things if they are going to help you personally. Quite a few here have used nail varnish and it certainly seems to help, as the chemo is uv sensitive and the darker varnish acts as a sun block, so well worth a try, but as we always say, everyone is different. You may use it and still have nail hassles they just won't be so severe. If you are not really into black you can always use the black as an undercoat for another colour, purple, dark red etc One thing to bear in mind if you do use varnish make sure you try to get an Acetone free varnish remover as the Acetone is a really harsh solvent. If you do still get nail problems like \"lifting\" from the base don't use false ones as the glue may get into your nail bed and interfere with the new nail growing underneath. Hope this helps until you get more replies from Maccy Angels.  George & Jackie.",

      "Content": "Morning Rhonda,  As you found triple positive means they can use every tool in the shed at their disposal to help you beat this crap into submission and give you the best prognosis. 14 out of 16 nodes is quite a high figure but the chemo, rads and Tamoxifen's job is to mop up and wipe out any stray cells that the surgery missed or eliminate their food supply and starve them to death and they do it very well. There are quite a few still here in Macland 5 years + some a lot longer and probably a helluva lot more who after a year of treatment find they no longer feel the need to come here and be reminded of a dark time in their lives and drift away to get on with their new lives post cancer who we never hear of again  :-) There are others who unfortunately come back 2, 5, even 12 years later when cancer revisits them and they have to go through surgery and chemo again there are no guarantees but hey,  they have been through it once they know what to expect and willingly bite the bullet again to gain more time with their loved ones. My mother in law has had BC 3 times in the last 15 years and just celebrated her 80th birthday by having way too much wine and falling over while dancing. My own mother had it twice and passed away aged 84 ( not through bc ) and my wife is also grade 3 triple positive and 18 months post MX,  Fec & Tax chemo, Herceptin and now on Letrozole. We all have that sword hanging over our heads but don't dwell on it, we just take each mammo as it comes and keep our fingers and toes crossed and hope each twinge we get is just that a twinge and nothing more sinister. The NHS has a breast cancer predict tool website where you enter in all your diagnosis and treatment stats and it gives you a guide as to how much extra time all the treatments have gained you. This is obviously done on percentages but as a guide it shows you how far treatment has come on in leaps and bounds over the last few years. It is that though, just a guide nothing is written in stone. If you feel you would like to punch in the numbers and see your results you can find it here.  http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict.shtml It can be scary, but most are pleasantly surprised at how good their prognosis is quoted. Take care Rhonda and best wishes for a lovely Christmas, George  &  Jackie.",

      "Content": "Hi  Gillie,  Back again  :-)  Love the \"Fabulous Maccynistas\" idea. You could be setting a trend here. Here's some more detailed nail info and tips for anyone about to journey on the Chemo Express. Hope it helps,  George  &  Jackie   Just as chemotherapy affects your hair because of the rapidly dividing hair follicle cells, it also affects your nails. You may see a line in the nail related to the cycle of chemotherapy. This line is not permanent and grows out with the nail, usually in about six months. There may even be multiple lines and indentations reflecting the different cycles of chemotherapy. Your nails may become pigmented or discolored. They may become more brittle, so they will not grow as long as they used to and may break more easily. The area around the nail bed may become dry, and your cuticles may fray. Do not rip or peel off the loose cuticle. Cut it carefully with a CLEAN pair of nail scissors. The nail may actually lift off the nail bed. While this, too, is reversible, you need to be very careful, for two reasons. First, the nail is more vulnerable and may fall off. Second, because the nail is not tightly bound to the nail bed, it can become a site for bacteria to enter. So be sure to practice excellent hygiene to avoid infection. Nail care is first-line prevention for lymphedema, a condition that develops when lymph fluid accumulates in the soft tissues of the arm, causing it to swell. If you have had an underarm lymph node dissection (with mastectomy or lumpectomy), you should be particular careful of damage to the nail, such as hangnails or cuts or burns on the hands or fingers, which could lead to infection. Tips for Better Nail Care Clip your nails short. Imperfections show up less in short nails. Do not cut your cuticles. Use cuticle remover cream or gels and push your nails back gently. Do not bite your nails or cuticles, particularly on the hand on the same side as your affected breast. If you have a hard time stopping, consider wearing thin white cotton gloves around the house to help you break this habit. Massage cuticle cream into the cuticle area daily to prevent dryness, splitting, and hangnails. Wear gloves while doing chores, such as washing dishes. Excessive exposure to water can lead to fungal infections of the nail bed. Wear nail polish to help keep nails strong and protected from the environment (and looking nice, too). If your nails are very dry or falling off, you might want to consider a nail moisturizer instead of polish. Dry nails can become weaker or more brittle during chemotherapy treatment. To take off polish, use non-acetone-based remover, which is less drying than acetone. Do not use acrylics or other nail wraps. Fake nails can trap bacteria that may cause infection. If you have a professional manicure, bring your own instruments, regardless of how the salon cleans theirs.",

Hi Tina, I misread this when I first spotted it earlier - I though you were a Tuba player :-) Great name though...  A lot of onco's switch people from Tamoxifen to Letrozole or one of the other AI's after a 2 year period on them and I can see where he is coming from. The joint and or bone pain can be a bit rough. To the extent of needing Adacal tablets to build up calcium to help against bone thinning and non steroidal anti inflammatory's for the aches. Must admit it's the first time I have heard of an oncologist advising stopping altogether. Anyone else here heard of this ? You seem fairly well 'genned up' on this but there is an info page about AI's here if you want to have a read about any of them in particular. Jackie my better half is halfway through 5 years of Letrozole and they can knock the stuffing out of you for sure, but her Predict % rating was much higher than the 1% you were given so for her it's a no brainer. Can't really advise as this has to be a personal choice - Talk about caught between a rock and a hard place. Damned if you do, and could be damned if you don't :-/ Personally for the 1% gained I think Jackie would have said no but whatever choice you make, make it with no regrets.

Is it a case of you just have hugs and kisses but it leads no further with no intimacy at all, which you would like, or are you not even having the hugs in case it leads to going further ? Think what I'm trying to ask is would you like take it further but are too ashamed of your body to go along with it, or is it your husband not wanting to put pressure on you to be intimate ? You are far from an empty shell, you just need to learn to love what you have got and not mourn what you have lost. You still have your husband when a lot of partners run to the hills, so he obviously loves and cares for you dearly, you have been given an upgraded cancer free version of your self albeit battered and a bit wonky with a few parts missing, but that is fine - as love really is blind.... I can see the hurt in your post, but it doesn't have to be this way and I hope some of the other ladies here can help you from a ladies point of view rather better than I can.

      "Content": "Hiya, No doubt there is a lot of confusion over these clutch of anti-hormone skittles. Tamoxifen is given if pre-menopause but as soon as you reach the menopause (usually after around 2 years) either naturally or caused by treatment they can switch you to one of the AI's (Letrozole, Anastrozole or Aromasin aka Exemestane) Mainly because these are more affective against recurrence than Tamoxifen but AI's cannot be given if pre-meno as they don't stop the ovaries producing oestrogen.  Of these AI's Letrozole is considered the better option statistically but it is more powerful - so worse side effects and possibly more of them. They prescribe the one they think you need based on the info they have from all your results so if you don't need the full metal jacket you won't be given Letrozole (sledgehammer to crack a nut) They do weigh up the benefits of particular type tablet against the effectiveness so what they offer you should be your best option. If you are finding a particular type of AI unbearable you can always ask about changing to something else for a trial period to see if things improve. If you are taking Tamoxifen there isn't really an alternative to that as yet apart from (ovarian ablation) which entails tablets to stop your ovaries oestrogen production or having them both removed surgically :-( G n' J",

If so, they are quite accurate and it could well be that your nodes were not affected so didn't need removing. Lymphoscintigraphy is a test to find out how well your lymphatic system is working. You have an injection of a small amount of radioactive substance into the lymph vessels. Then you have a scan. The scan shows the dye moving through the lymphatic system and shows up any blockages. I would phone and ask about the results though, you could ask for a copy too, it's handy to keep papers like this in case you need to refer back to them for info later on. Anyone else had this in place of a sentinel node biopsy ? G n' J",

They are a great bunch of Maccy Angels on here though  :-)  Grade 1, might not seem like it now, but that's a nice low number to be the owner of and Marsden have a brilliant reputation for treatment. Being hormone receptive is also a good thing which means they know what is feeding it, which gives more treatment options than hormone negative results. The Letrozole (Femara) will gradually wipe out your oestrogen which your BC is hormone receptive for, basically cutting off it's food supply which has to be a good thing. Causing shrinkage, slow down of growth or stopping it altogether and helps in case any rogue cells escape the lumpectomy and rads. Yes,  there are side effects but everyone is different and of the long list you may only be affected by one or two and you can get other drugs to help counteract those which makes it more do'able.  Treatment is not a walk in the park, but it's also not the life sentence it was even 10 years ago. Fingers crossed you get clear margins from the lumpectomy and it's a nice small growth. Rule 1 - Don't google,  stick to Macmillan and Breastcancercare websites that way you'll know the information is up to date and factual,  there is a lot of crap info out there. Rule 2 - Cancer is a word NOT a sentence,  don't let it make you a prisoner. Rule 3 - Anything goes here,  so if you have a question,  need to have a rant or just need to know you are not on your own just holler , you'll soon get some replies  :-)  Assume you have already read macmillan's Letrozole page but if not you can find it here. http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Hormonaltherapies/Individualhormonaltherapies/Letrozole.aspx  Best wishes, and very best of good luck,  George & Jackie.",

Do you know if this new trial drug (unnamed) goes by the number GDC0941 which is a biological therapy being trialled with Anastrozole or something else - and do you keep taking it with the anastrozole of just carry on with the ansatrozole on it's own ? I don't think it really makes much difference which hormonal therapy tablets you take, they all have similar side effects but if the regime you are on is do'able it makes sense to stick with it (better the devil you know) and all that. To be honest it can take 2 weeks to a month to start getting these tablets into your system so it is early days as yet for side effect issues :-/ When do you start your rads and have you any questions or concerns regarding that ? Hope you are recovering well from surgery - Take care, G n' J",

The only info I found in Maccyland is this small snippet.  It's in the new drugs section of this page. It mentions emtansine which I assume is the chemo drug the herceptin is delivering ?  according to this webpage is now known as Kadcyla ?

      "Content": "Hi SunnyMaz, Nice to read you seem to be recovering from surgery well :) Were you given a DEXA bone density scan before being put onto the Letrozole ? as letrozole over time can cause slight bone thinning so base figures will mean they can keep a check on this.... If not you should be able to get one arranged through your GP. As for the Rads - You will given as assessment appointment which will be around a week before your rads start. You will get a little guided tour and a chat with the radiographers and chance to ask any questions you may have and you will also be aligned on the machine and have 3 or 4 very small black tattoo dots that they use to line the machine up to daily. It saves a lot of time measuring everything every day. Do ask if they supply the cream for use during rads, some do, some don't... If yours don't you must get some before the sessions start. You may well be given a CT scan at the assessment as well - this is purely for their information they are not 'looking' for anything so don't be alarmed by this. One thing you may want to ask about is car parking if you will be going by car. Most hospitals allow free parking for rads patients either with a free parking voucher or claiming parking fees back. You could have a look online at your hospitals website to check their parking policies as they do differ area to area. You could have a read of this - Radiotherapy For Breast Cancer.

I had to have a browse around and from what I was reading - Yes the chemo can have an effect on the bacteria and upset the balance of the 'flora'. Even if it doesn't kill it all off it can cause less breakdown of solid waste and toilet paper making the chances of a blockage a possibility. Maybe it's a case of it would be so diluted it would have little effect ? There are bacteria booster / enhancers you can add but I'm unsure if these would suffer the same fate. It would be worthwhile phoning your water supplier or tank emptying service about this to see what they advise. It must be an issue they have come across before ? Anyone ? G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya Judith, Sorry didn't reply last night was up at 04:30 yesterday so half asleep later last night. I can only give you a few pointers and J's experience but hopefully it may help. Tamoxifen originally was the only inhibitor tablet available given but because of endometrial risks and other complications these other types of tablet were formulated and are considered better post meno. Tamoxifen is the one that is given mostly if you are pre menopausal or borderline as the other two don't work if the ovaries are still producing oestrogen. Then after a year or so with no periods you may well be switched to Anastrozole or Letrozole (other sweeties are available) To be totally honest I have no idea what criteria doctors use to prescribe Anastrozole over Letrozole or vice-versa. They both work in the same way and have similar side effects but they are different so if you can't get on with one maybe the other is more do'able. What with that and the obvious fillers / coatings issues from all the various makes (which even if denied we ALL know does has some bearing on the many side effects) makes this a minefield to find the ONE that suits you the best. Jackie was given 2 months worth Femara (letrozole) by her onco unit right from the start. When these ran out she was given through our local pharmacy several different other types Teva, Accord and Heinz-57 :-) and felt even more cra* with these. Luckily our GP is brilliant and made her repeat out for Femara and she has been having these for over two and a half years now (whoopee! - half way) She takes 2 x Adacl+ 1 x Sunvit D3 daily and one Alendronic tablet per week to counter bone thinning as the results from her 2nd Dexa scan a few months in came back as osteopaenic. Even though she has found the 'one' that is kindest to her, she still hates the damn things and what they have done to her - BUT it is far better than risking the alternative. Especially seeing as her consultant said being ER, PR and HER2+ (triple pos) there is a 10% difference in her re-occurment risk with or without them :-( Her side effects are, gained around 7kg's in weight which won't budge, seized up joints first thing in the morning which ache a bit later in the day and into the evening, generally feeling like she has aged 20 years and Labyrinthitis (probably) but may be a separate issue. Oh, and global warming :-) There are booklets about each of these individual Hormone Inhibitor tablets halfway down this page listed under Hormonal Therapies / Aromatase Inhibitors. Sorry we can't be of more help with this one, seems it's just a case of plodding on until you find the best one for you. If you prefer Femara TELL your Oncologist (don't ask as it gives them the opportunity to say no) you want these, they aren't ones suffering the side effects and this comment of 'inactive fillers not affecting them' is absolute BS or they would all be the same for everyone. If they won't play ball get your gp to change your repeat to read Femara rather than just Letrozole - Most gp's are willing to do this as they are the ones dealing with your treatment baggage on a regular basis. Good luck with the ongoing battle, G n' J",

Have they given you a treatment plan as yet, or they still tailoring that to suit you ? The treatments can be varied but usually go in one of two directions. Surgery first which could be what they call a WLE (lumpectomy) where they remove the tumour with a healthy margin of tissue, or if it is in a difficult position or for other reasons you may actually need a mastectomy. Either of these although very scary to hear or read about are not as bad as you ever imagine, honestly... Then you could get chemo and radiotherapy.The other route is chemo first, then surgery, rads. A lot depends on type size position etc so you could get offered any combination of the above. Jackie was diagnosed grade 3 just over 2 years ago so we are well out of treatment and helping where we can - she had mastectomy, FEC + T chemo, Herceptin and rads. Know this is all a headspin at the moment but once you get a treatment plan in place you will feel a little calmer and more in control. I won't say much more as others here will want to say Hi and help you too. If you need any info there is a link to some Macmillan breast books under the cup cakes image below.

They automatically make an appointment for you if any biopsy is taken to get the results within 2 weeks and to not come alone. If your fears are confirmed as soon as you get the bad news you focus on the C word and just don't take anything else in, so an extra pair of ears can pick up on information you miss. Whatever they spotted on the ultrasound screen must have looked suspicious enough for them to have taken the biopsy, but it is early days and there are a lot of non-cancerous benign lumps like fibroids, calcification or a pre cancerous conditions which can show up - some benign fatty tumours can keep growing so this could mean surgery of some sort  :( None of us here have anything nice to say about waiting results this will be a very emotional time for you, we all hated the waiting results period - 2 weeks will seem like a lifetime :( You have replied to a quite old discussion here - If you have other questions or need some support at a worrying time, don't hesitate to create a New Discussion that way you know all the replies are for you :) As for how you get through the next 2 weeks without it getting to you - the best thing is to do things, go places or throw yourself into a hobby, anything that occupies your thoughts and kills the waiting time.

I would phone your breast care nurse, or better still your onco and let them know about both the foot pain and nails darkening. They may want to have a look and possibly reduce your dose by 20% for your next session but it's only just over a week away so if reducing will help you need to let them know sooner rather than leaving it any longer. The nails you may lose at some point but the foot pain definitely needs dealing with as this can get quite bad if not kept in check even leading to being so sore you are almost unable to walk :-/ Some units can offer cooling boots like the cold cap for those who get foot problems (gloves too) maybe this could also be an option ? There are several here who have had very painful feet who hopefully will reply and let you know what helped them. Just a quick note, friction can make this worse so for now try to avoid anything that causes foot friction like step excersies walking up hill - steps /  stairs on the balls of your feet (keep them flat) it's not unusual for this to affect hands too, so no unscrewing actions like bottle / jar lids and if you can get one of those undoing gizmo's arthritic folks use.

Nail changes can happen towards the end of chemo, or as you have found anything up to 6 months afterwards. The main thing to keep a close eye on if your nails are lifting is skin breaks and the chances of an infection getting in - so please don't pull them off if they are hanging on by skin tags. Last thing you want is to risk lymphoedema from an infection (don't know how many lymph nodes you had removed)  If they are not only feeling sore but looking a bit inflamed do get them checked out by either your GP or breast care nurse. Until you get some other replies you could have a look here (link)  J lost all 20 of her nails in the end but this is a bit unusual, most if they get this chemo related nail problem only loose a few. It's mostly caused by Docetaxel / Taxotere but some other chemo drugs can cause this too. Hope this helps for now, oh! and welcome to the group btw. Take care, G n' J",

I don't want to sway you one way or the other but if it were me I would take my chances without the chemo and put my faith in the Radiotherapy and Letrozole. Letrozole is very good at starving ER+ cells of their food supply and is also used prior to surgery to actually shrink tumours down by quite a bit. Letrozole can be a bit tough on your joints though (there's always a sting in the tail) Only having one lymph node involved is good if there were a lot more it would be a harder choice to make.

      "Content": "Hiya, It is a bit of a grey area. For BC patients who have any type of lymph surgery (SNB or clearance) it mostly affects the arm, chest and/or shoulder on the affected side while the lymph fluid tries to find another route to flow way. That is why it can be more of a problem if you have a complete clearance. Just after surgery can be a confusing time figuring out it is it lymph fluid or seroma fluid from the cut tissue wounds. Lymphoedema can occur anytime post lymph surgery (even years) if you get an injury allowing infection into the affected side. That is why you have to be so careful about blood samples, cuts, scratches, insect bites etc on that side. The lymph system is massive I think there is an image in the first link Breast Cancer Care leaflet and covers the whole body - If I can I'll paste it in If you think of it like a map of major roads with vehicles on, when you get an accident it is localised in one area, but can cause bottlenecks and spread if nothing is done to help clear it. Thats is where specially trained Lymph drainage nurses can massage the fluid away you can also learn to do this yourself if lymphoedema is a problem ? Bit random, but it's the best way I could explain it :-) G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi  Amy,  Have you any particular reason to think this may be breast cancer, relatives or friends who have had this in the past, or is it your mind running on overdrive and you Google'ing too much ? Have you had any arm/hand or other infections, or flu recently as the lymphs in your armpit are to trap infection bugs etc and just like the glands in your throat will swell and get a bit sore when they do. Could be a muscle / tendon strain, any number of things can cause this. Think worrying and fear of the unknown is only natural when you think the worst but please don't Google most of the information out there is either wrong, or way out of date. Stick with this Macmillan site, or breastcancercare.uk for reliable info from those who have it, or deal with this crap daily. As Emma said the only thing we are sure about is worrying won't alter the outcome of any tests and will only either make you a nervous wreck or depressed.  Assume it's an ultrasound scan the GP has you booked in at the breast clinic for (as opposed to a mammogram) ?  So at least you have done the right thing in getting it checked out early as many go into denial and leave it too long before seeking help. Keep in touch and don't hesitate to ask as many Q's as you like, fingers crossed your scan will be fine and you'll soon be telling us just that, or if your worst fears end up being confirmed either way, we're all here to help you. This is a very big club with some of the friendliest, helpful Breast Buddies there are  :-) Take care and good luck,  George & Jackie.",

Don't think of your referral as to a Bowel Cancer dept - It's planting worries where they may be no need - obviously they check for cancer too but there can be so many other causes for this problem. The colon is way down the list as usual sites for breast secondaries and very uncommon, so hang onto that thought. This could just as likely be Crohns, IBS, a bowel infection or slight ulceration in fact anything that speeds up the transit of waste so the fluid in it doesn't get time to be re-absorbed before it reaches the end of the line. Would be interesting to read if others have had this problem with Letrozole ? G n' J",

Jackie went the latter and we ended up living on curries and chilli pasta bakes for what seemed like ages.

      "Content": "Morning Roundhouse1 Sorry to read your mum is very much glass half empty at the moment, this sounds very much like some form of depression - Has she suffered from that previously ?  Most feel a bit down for a few days post surgery as that can be a side effect of the annaesthesia but perk up once they get back home. As you say HER2+ BC isn't that rare of the 50K women in the UK diagnosed with BC yearly around 20% will be HER2+ so we are talking around 200 per week nationwide. That figure is why the newer targeted treatments for it were developed and they work very well. My wife was HER2+ and also left mastectomy back in May 2012 and apart from the odd ache still has no evidence of disease at her 6 year scan. This is very do'able although the treatment (usually chemo plus H&P) can be tough some days, they work and anything that stops this coming back elswhere in the future has got to be worth it long term. It isn't unusual for a few cells to be found in the nearest lymph nodes to the tumour as it is the nodes job to trap any stray cells should they come away but even if this is the case those few cells will be wiped out by the chemo and radiotherapy. I'm fairly sure most of the replies here will be very similar to ours both from those having treatment at the moment to the other ladies here who have been there, done that, come out of the treatment tunnel and living their new normal - Read or show them to your mum if only to try and get her to see this isn't the end of the world, just a crappy few months she has to get through to get her towards her 80th birthday :) Hope this is of some help, do get back to us, we're all here to help if we can but a lot of this means your mum will have to make the first move to find herself again or she will continue to drag you all down and the upshot of that will be family not visiting her to avoid the scenario altogether.

There is also an Under 50's Breast Group here (link) as well - it isn't quite as active as this main group most under 50's join both - There are ladies here around the 30's age group. Being so young they will probably go more by the Ultrasound Scan images although you may also be given a mammogram but as your breast tissue will be a lot  more dense so they mamogram images are not quite so clear. If anything suspicious is seen they will no doubt use a hollow needle to take some biopsies for the pathology lab to check out. To help you get your head around the breast clinic scenario I have placed a link to a booklet Macmillan produces titled 'Understanding Breast Screening'  Just click / tap the cover image below to read and/or download. There are lots of various benign breast conditions so do hope for the best rather than fearing the worst. Hope this is of some help for now, no doubt you will soon get some welcoming messages from the other ladies here, unfortunately this is a busy place. Fingers tightly crossed for you, G n' J",

Think another problem is that the seroma fluid takes up and fills the space left behind after surgery and by having it drained it just as you say it fills up again because you have provided space again so it ends up being a viscious circle. It can be a slow process and a bit uncomfortable but if you can tolerate it for a longer period without getting it aspirated you may find it will eventually slow right down to a level where the fluid produced can be re absorbed back into your body until it just stops altogether. Any other members with thoughts on this and how you overcome it ? Hope it clams down a bit, take care, George & Jackie",

I had three chemo sessions at FEC 100 and like you, &nbsp;it was my fourth when I was switched to T.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>My FEC experience got progressively worse, the third took me much longer to recover from, having said this it was the psychological struggle I found hardest, my physical symptoms were pretty mild compared to many women&#39;s.<\/p> <p>I was really anxious about changing as even though the final FEC had been tougher, at least I knew what to expect!<\/p> <p>Surprisingly this first Taxotere has been much better for me. The nausea and lethargy of FEC are gone. Still feel tired but it&#39;s not as debilitating as the fatigue was on my body and my spirit!<\/p> <p>The only other symptoms I have had are some lower backache, twinges and mild discomfort in my legs, toenail and finger nail pain and a sore tongue. (oh and of course the ongoing effects of bloating, indigestion and constipation brought on by an increase in steroids!!!)<\/p> <p>The aches passed after a week, the tongue, which felt like I&#39;d burnt my mouth and tongue with hot tea or something started to clear after a week too so I&#39;m left now with the finger nail pain which to be honest only hurts if I catch them, the rest of the time it&#39;s more discomfort than pain.<\/p> <p>At this point if I had to choose between Taxotere and FEC I&#39;d choose Taxotere every time!.<\/p> <p>I&#39;v learned that in cancer treatment you can take nothing for granted however and so I&#39;m assuming that like the FEC, each additional Taxotere infusion will build on the last and as such my fifth and sixth sessions may well bring more intense symptoms.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, as many women have said on here-we each experience pain and discomfort differently and our vulnerable places, whether they be physical, psychological or both, are going to be pushed to the limits at times.<\/p> <p>My only advice would be protect yourself, nurture yourself and take the preventative meds provided.<\/p> <p>Rest, rest and lots of TLC.<\/p> <p>Good luck. I will be thinking of you.<\/p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"signature\"><p>Roobieerants<\/p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><\/div> <div class=\"post-footer\"> <a href=\"/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/breast-cancer-forum/p/857711/reply?ReplyToContentTypeID=1&amp;Page=2\" class=\"reply\">Reply<\/a> <div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div> <div class=\"likes-message content-likes-message unregistered\"> <span class=\"ui-like ui-tip\" data-tipcontent=\"initialmessage\" data-contentid=\"b4e938dd-5dd1-4a7b-8537-db515249c03c\" data-contenttypeid=\"f586769b-0822-468a-b7f3-a94d480ed9b0\" data-initialcount=\"6\" data-initialstate=\"false\" data-readonly=\"true\" data-initialmessage=\"&lt;a href=&quot;/members/dreamthief&quot; class=&quot;internal-link view-user-profile&quot;>Dreamthief&lt;/a> and &lt;span class=&quot;who-likes&quot;>5 others&lt;/span> like this\" data-format=\"{message}\" data-configuration=\"Format=%7Bmessage%7D&amp;IncludeTip=true&amp;LikeTypeId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" ><\/span> <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"group-discussion-post\"> <div class=\"full-post-container\" data-reply-id=\"857728\" data-thread-starter=\"false\" > <div class=\"post\"> <a name=\"857728\"><\/a> <div class=\"post-header\"> <div class=\"avatar\"><img src=\"/cfs-filesystemfile/__key/communityserver-components-imagefileviewer/communityserver-components-avatars-00-00-13-27-27/4TYQ3SAYF7ZP.jpg_2D00_32x32.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Jammyfiona\" /><\/div> <div class=\"author \"> Posted by <a class=\"view-user-profile\" href=\"/members/jammyfiona\">Jammyfiona<\/a> <\/div> <div class=\"date\"> <a href=\"/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/breast-cancer-forum/105530/after-taxotere/857728#857728\"> 21 Feb 2016 11:47 AM<\/a><\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>Hello roobieerants<\/p> <p>that&#39;s really helpful to hear from someone whose exoerience has been totally different and I hope Teresa you read that and get comfort from that different perspective.<\/p> <p>funny for me FEC was easier each time!

OK, I really could do with a new bottom because the constipation has been horrendous but I now have my Movicol prescription and we&#39;re becoming very good friends! <\/p> <p> <\/p> <p> With T its the unknown again, I think that&#39;s the crux of the matter. I&#39;m scared that I got away lightly and I&#39;m going to be floored by it - but I was just as scared before the first FEC and I&#39;m still here. I&#39;m half way through chemo - 2 more months and it&#39;ll be finished.  <\/p> <p> <br /> <\/p> <p> Thank you for bucking me up when I needed it - time to pull on my big girl pants and just get on with it!!! <\/p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"signature\"><p>Love Teresa x <\/p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><\/div> <div class=\"post-footer\"> <a href=\"/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/breast-cancer-forum/p/857798/reply?ReplyToContentTypeID=1&amp;Page=2\" class=\"reply\">Reply<\/a> <div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div> <div class=\"likes-message content-likes-message unregistered\"> <span class=\"ui-like ui-tip\" data-tipcontent=\"initialmessage\" data-contentid=\"f645334f-6fea-41ed-a510-5db15bd0c36e\" data-contenttypeid=\"f586769b-0822-468a-b7f3-a94d480ed9b0\" data-initialcount=\"4\" data-initialstate=\"false\" data-readonly=\"true\" data-initialmessage=\"&lt;a href=&quot;/members/islapops&quot; class=&quot;internal-link view-user-profile&quot;>Islapops&lt;/a> and &lt;span class=&quot;who-likes&quot;>3 others&lt;/span> like this\" data-format=\"{message}\" data-configuration=\"Format=%7Bmessage%7D&amp;IncludeTip=true&amp;LikeTypeId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" ><\/span> <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"group-discussion-post\"> <div class=\"full-post-container\" data-reply-id=\"857821\" data-thread-starter=\"false\" > <div class=\"post\"> <a name=\"857821\"><\/a> <div class=\"post-header\"> <div class=\"avatar\"><img src=\"/cfs-filesystemfile/__key/communityserver-components-imagefileviewer/communityserver-components-avatars-00-00-13-27-27/4TYQ3SAYF7ZP.jpg_2D00_32x32.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Jammyfiona\" /><\/div> <div class=\"author \"> Posted by <a class=\"view-user-profile\" href=\"/members/jammyfiona\">Jammyfiona<\/a> <\/div> <div class=\"date\"> <a href=\"/cancer_types/breast-cancer/f/breast-cancer-forum/105530/after-taxotere/857821#857821\"> 21 Feb 2016 3:09 PM<\/a><\/div> <\/div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>Hello Teresa&nbsp;<\/p> <p>i was so anxious before my first FEC too but like you managed them quite well.....actually the constipation was the worst bit for me too!&nbsp;<\/p> <p>I think that was the problem for me this time round ....I became very blas&eacute; and thought I would be just fine.

Septembers will start Wednesday afternoon sometime. As it is coming to the end of the month there are quite a lot of pages of messages, please don't be put off by the number of side effect posts. There are a lot of people having chemo at this time and those who sail through chemo don't need to ask questions so you get a skewed view of it all.  There is a 'chemo aid' link in the first message about help with side effects and other helpful hints. Do you know which chemotherapy drugs your daughter is having ? Most here have FEC-T but there are other variations. Ginger Nut and Arrowroot biscuits can help with any taste / nausea issues and Paracetamol an hour before using the scalp cooling cap (ice cream headache) Some chemo units will supply hair conditioner, some don't so she may need to buy her own. There is quite a shopping list to help make this more do'able. There is some information about Scalp Cooling and Hairloss here. Hope this is of some help to start with,. I have a feeling your daughter will soon be wanting some help as this is a tough call to try solo. Take care, G n' J",

When the chemo finishes and you carry on with just the Herceptin it is a lot more easier to cope and with very few side effects.

      "Content": "Hi LondonLass  Lack of oestrogen can be a bugger to come to terms with, especially if you are younger (pre-menopause) when your oestrgoen suddenly gets switched off  - Oestrogen is one of the bodies feel good hormones and this is why you suffer with low mood without it :( Tamoxifen has been found to cause cognitive impairment similar to chemo brain as it works on stopping your ovaries from producing oestrogen. I assume when you mention 'was on' Tamoxifen you have now stopped taking that and been given Zoladex / Goserelin instead  - have you been switched to another Aromatse Inhibitor type hormone therapy tablet as well, or just stopped the tamoxifen ? It isn't so much of a problem for post meno ladies as the only oestrogen being produced is from the adrenal glands and a little from body fat cells as the ovaries have already shut up shop - although even this smaller amount of oestrogen loss is still noticeable :( Some people produce more oestogen than others so it is more noticeable when it gets shut off. You could have a chat with your Onco to see if there are any other alternative hormone therapies if you are nearer being classed as menopausal but to be honest they all make you feel cr*p but in differing ways. Sorry there isn't a magic remedy all you can do is try ways to minimise the issues they cause you, and if you can't ease the baggage decide what your recurrence risk % of not taking them is :( G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Theresa28 It may be worth looking into the Exemestane (Aromasin) option as I think exemestane are steroidal based and Letrozole and Anastrozole are not, so may be better for you. All of these hormone inhibitor tablets have similar side effects to a greater or lesser extend because the side effects are more from the lack of oestrogen than from the tablets, but changing again may be the lesser of the 3 evils.  At least that way your ER+ worries are still covered. There are quite a few ladies here who have ended up taking Exemestane so hopefully will give you their experiences :) As for your sex life again - no oestrogen equals a big reduction of your bodies natural lubrication. A lot of the members in the cervical / vaginal groups get very similar problems after pelvic radiotherapy and the 2 products they mostly recommend are YES and SYLK. The Sylk webpage link also has a free offer section to get a freebie sample and I believe both products are paraben free. If you have a sympathetic GP you may even get this on prescription :) Hope this is of some help, take care, G n' J",

The only time this isn't offered is if you have any ongoing heart problems as it can affect heart chamber muscles by weakening them slightly. This booklet will give you some info about Herceptin. The most common chemo to be used alongside Hereptin is Docetaxel (every 3 weeks) or Taxol (weekly) but others are available depending on your oncologists choice. Some units now administer Herceptin as an injection, some still use the drip pump bag and cannula method. You could look up docetaxel and taxol using the cancer information button at the top of the page but they might offer you something else ? Jackie was HER2+ and was given 3 x FEC, then 3 x Docetaxel - the Herceptin was started with the first Docetaxel. Get back to us when you get your regime confirmed and we can post more info.

There is a regular monthly chemo club too.. You can find July's here (link) There is a 'Chemo Tips' link in the first message you can check out. Notice you  said you started FEC 2 weeks ago - How is the head ? any sign of it getting sore pending hair loss ? You seem to be doing all the right things to ease the side effects bummer it isn't helping much.  You could go back to basics and try making a mouthwash from Bicarb of Soda and water to rinse with.  It may be down to the steroids wiping out your mouths good bacteria or could be an allergy issue from the chemo. Some find an anti-histamine like Piriton helps, you could ask your onco if this is ok - also next time you are having chemo take some frozen grapes to suck they can chill your mouth off and this seems to help. Don't think they would let you take in a tub of Haagen Dazs :) One of the most recommended hand/foot creams is Udderly Smooth (make sure you get the one with Urea though) Don't know offhand if you can get it from any high street chemist outlets but Amazon deffo does it. Sore bums not good, is that from going too often (chemo trots?) Warm welcome BTW, no doubt you'll be around for the long haul and we'll see you about the place. 26 is a crap age to get hit with the cancer brick :( No doubt the other lovely ladies here will come and say hi! and give you some tips as to what helped them :) Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Lee, Don't know what stage / grade your were classed as or your age, but all this Chemo, Herceptin and hormone inhibitor tablets (given to ER+) post surgery is all about avoiding recurrence. Think the overriding fact here is the HER2+ part - see below - HER2-positive breast cancer is a type of breast cancer where the tumour cells carry much more of the HER2 protein than normal, healthy breast cells.  HER2 helps relay communication signals through the cell which tell it to divide.  It also prevents the cell from going through a process called 'apoptosis, where the cell commits suicide should things get out of control.  This combination of promoting cell division and preventing cell death contributes to the growth of HER2-positive tumours. Somewhere between 15-25% of all breast cancers are HER2-positive and these patients tend to be at a higher risk of recurrence following treatment.  Patients are tested to see if their tumour is HER2-positive or not prior to treatment so that the best treatment can be selected for them.  The drug Herceptin has revolutionised treatment for this type of breast cancer because it specifically targets the HER2 protein, effectively shutting off the signals telling the cells to grow.......... You can ask your oncologist to crunch the numbers using the NHS predict tool to give you a recurrence estimate with or without chemo and Herceptin. Everyone hates the thought of chemo but even if the risk of recurrence is 10% would you want to risk being one of those one in ten who it re-ocurrs for in a few of years time ? Because you are ER+ you will be given daily tablets for 5 maybe 10 years so adding chemo and Herceptin to the list will mean you have done everything you possibly can to avoid this coming back to bite you. I'm fairly sure NICE only allows Herceptin if used in conjunction with chemo. Hope this is given you some thought of questions to ask your onco team. Take care, G n' J",

Warm welcome to the breast group, not that we like seeing new members to this particular club. You can ramble on, smash plates, have a good rant, anything goes here if it helps get the angst out. Like Karen says so much has changed with breast cancer treatment even within the last 4 years yet alone 10 - It now has a 90% recovery rate. Just about everyone says they feel every ache and twinge after they get the news it's mostly down to being so tensed up and stressy sleepless nights - the pain you felt beforehand from your shoulder is highly likely to be coincidental and nothing to do with this. Feeling a bit guilty for handing out bad news is natural but everyone knows you didn't ask for this so let go of that and just be yourself as they will react to how you come over - Know it's tough at first but if they see you are positive about this they will be happier around you. Crying in the shower is a good way to get it out if it gets too much at times. Hope you get good results from all your scanxiety, this initial waiting results time is what everyone hated the most. As soon as you get a treatment plan put in place  it gives you something else to focus on. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, we're all here to help.

This isn't what NICE recommends for those having aromatase inhibitors like Exemestane, Letrozole or Anastrozole.... See Below, it's the very first item mentioned..... 1.10 Assessment and treatment of bone loss 1.10.1 Patients with early invasive breast cancer should have a baseline dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone mineral density if they: are starting adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment have treatment-induced menopause are starting ovarian ablation/suppression therapy. 1.10.2 Do not offer a DEXA scan to patients with early invasive breast cancer who are receiving tamoxifen alone, regardless of pretreatment menopausal status. 1.10.3 Offer bisphosphonates to patients identified by algorithms 1 and 2 in 'Guidance for the management of breast cancer treatment-induced bone loss: a consensus position statement from a UK expert group' (2008)[12] (see appendix 2 of the full guideline). This is part of the cancer pathway not for just checking for osteopaenia and should be carried out to get baseline figures prior to starting the aromatase tablets so they can monitor any bone thinning. The reason that Tamoxifen users don't get a Dexa scan is that Tamoxifen doesn't cause bone thinning like the aromatase tablets. Personally I wouldn't take any supplements as yet as they will skew the Dexa scan results, wait a little while until you get this fob off delay sorted out - Do get back to whoever told you it would take a year and explain why you need one soon quoting NICE if you need to.

What you could do is browse the groups topics for a few days, post a few replies here and there and get to 'meet' the regulars. You'll soon find a few you have an affinity with who you can 'Add as Friends' and send private messages to. You could check out the Private Messages and Adding Friends section by clicking this link. Have you actually started chemo yet, and which chemo drugs regime have you been put on ? Exercise during chemo will be good for you but there will be days when you are totally wiped out so any serious training may have to go on the back burner for a while, but once you start ticking the sessions off the time goes really quickly.

      "Content": "Hiya MamaSm, Ditto what omg said - also if you feel any slight pain, heat or spot any reddening let the onco nurse know and they will take things a bit slower. If it is rushed (onco units can be very busy at times) or not diluted enough with the saline it can cause problems with your veins. They will probably keep asking you how you feel but in case your nurse isn't so 'switched on' keep an eye on how things are going. Morning appointments always seem to be a bit more casual than mid to late afternoon ones, so if you get a choice go for early. If they are running late it's the afternoon appt's that can get rushed through. If your first appt is later in the day, when you have finished and book the next session ask if you can have an earlier one if it suits you better or they will give you one around the same time everytime. They should be looking out for reactions to 'any' of the three drugs (assume you are having FEC) and because of this your first session it may take a little longer, which is a good thing. If they give you steroids try not to take one too late in the day or you will have a helluva problem getting to sleep - you don't want be known locally as the crazy 3am Dyson lady :-) oh, and they may make you want to graze all the time so keep plenty of low fat nibbles around..... or Choccy Hobnob's yum... Good luck with it, it's all very do'able even the tiredness, don't fight that - have nana naps if and when you want them. George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Hiya, There are cases where chemoptherapy is very successful in shrinking tumours down to almost nothing. To the extent they insert titanium markers clips into the breast prior to chemo in case they have problems finding the tumours on subsequent scans. Chemotherapy will always have some impact on tumours the scale of any shrinkage will determine which surgery option is best for her as everyone has different results. But of course this will not be determined until after her sessions. She will be monitored during chemo to keep a check on any shrinkage. You mention 8 rounds of chemo - Do you know if this is the same chemo regime for all 8 sessions or could it be four sessions on one type of chemo then switching to a Taxane based chemotherapy drug for the other 4 ? If you could find out which chemo drugs are being offered there is extensive information about all chemo individual and combination regimes of drugs on this site we could refer you to. Regarding having children, this is a 'toughie'  They (or you) should look into this further. Get them to check out with their oncologist the chances of her chemotherapy regime making her infertile. Unfortunately this can be quite common and they may need to seek help with this regarding freezing eggs or embryo's for future use.  I believe embryo's seem to have a better prospect of being more viable after freezing than eggs but I'm uncertain of this as I'm not medically trained. You can find more info from this Macmillan booklet 'Fertility and Cancer Treatments for Women'  This can be saved when the page opens to maybe pass on to them as an attatchment ? As for her HER2 test coming back as 3 I would think that is to be taken as a positive if it had been 1 or 2 (borderline) it may have been worth checking again - You can read more about the Dako Herceptest here. There are so many younger women getting diagnosed lately this is because detection has greatly improved over recent years - I would very much doubt if BC had been diagnosed without very accurate pathology information to base it on. Having said that cancer is in itself an evil genius and mis-diagnosis can happen, mostly it is the other way around though, where someone gets a negative result which later turns out to be untrue and by then it is more advanced :( Personally I would have thought Canada to be 'way up there' on the expertise league table with great breast cancer surgeons and oncologists. If you haven't already it may be advisable to join a couple of Canada's more trusted breast cancer support sites to test the water regarding he best places for a second opinion - I have heard of, is it Sunnybrook in Toronto ?  but time to check all this out and getting second opinion appointments arranged may be wasting time they don't really have ? as treatment of any kind needs to start quite quickly. Hope this helps a bit, G n' J",

The time when you are more susceptible is during the middle week of 3 (days 7-15) Just to mention a few pitfalls but most are fairly obvious - Pets / Animals if you have or come into contact with either leave any cleaning up for others or wear  disposable latex gloves. During this week try to stay clear of places where you could pick up an infection. Other peoples snotty / sick children (it's almost impossible to avoid your own) doctors waiting rooms. Do the supermarket shop at a time the store is quieter. Making a good job of mouthwash and teeth/gum brushing as the steroids kill off all the good bacteria in your mouth which normally prevent oral thrush forming. Handwashing of course, but especially your own. By this I don't mean every 10 minutes :)  Hands are the most common way to infect yourself. There are a few food items to avoid during this week as well. No uncooked meats, or seafood and no live or pro-biotic yoghurts etc  There are plenty of alternatives you can have instead. Good point from Jannie about getting fast food to save the hassle of cooking etc.  Places like Fish and Chip shops, KFC and MaccyD should be fine but beware of places that can 'flash' fry meats like Chinese and Indian takeaways as it may not always be cooked through.

      "Content": "Morning Lorraine,  They only get a rough idea of type and grade from any biopsies. It's not until they get tissue results from WLE or Mastectomy the full picture emerges.  Nearly everyone gets their initial results 'tweaked' after histology. As for the B5b - It's a table they used when examining the cells to establish the amount and type of cell abnormality.  The B categories are as follows: B1 \u2013 normal B2 \u2013 benign B3 \u2013 uncertain malignant potential B4 \u2013 suspicious (further samples required) B5 \u2013 malignant. For B5, it should be noted whether this is B5a, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or B5b, invasive carcinoma Although yours are at the top end of the spectrum, don't see this as too scary. Bear in mind the size was small, so caught early. Grade 2 is still better than 3 or 4 and it appears to be sort of borderline between 5a and 5b so although it has wiggled it's way out of the duct it cannot be by much and they must be sure they have got clear margins, or they would have had you back in to take some more tissue. Have you heard if any nodes on your SNB were affected, or if you are ER/PR or HER2 positive yet as this will further determine your treatment regime ? You may be told you need chemo, or with grade 2 you may be given the choice of chemo or not - different consultants have different views. You will be offered Herceptin if HER2+ which is only given with chemo. There may be exceptions, but I haven't read anyone here being given Herceptin without chemo. Maybe the above information will be forthcoming at your next consultation ? - it may be worth you making a note of any questions before then as you will never remember them at the time :-) PS - Keeker mentioned the Understanding Your Pathology booklet - so I just edited in the link.

I don't know of anyone mentioning on here about chemo risk to others ? Your body will break down and get rid of the chemo drugs within about 48 hours by natural process. So by that it means expelling \"any\" body fluids / solids may contain residue chemo. That's why everyone will recommend taking in lots of fluid just prior to and for the first few days of treatment to help flush it out. The important chemicals that do the work will already now be locked in to search and destroy  :-) Please do ask your onco team about this, they may suggest you avoid long contact with children during your treatment anyway as they will be a much bigger threat to \"you\" regarding picking up infections than you are to them when your white count is at its lowest ( middle week of three ) May not be so bad while the summer school holidays are ongoing with their germ breeding centres (classrooms) closed for 7 weeks, it's different if they are your own children at home as you all share germs and will have each others antibodies.   Hopefully, you won't need chemo,  but if you do we'll all help you through it.  George & Jackie. ",

I can understand them wanting to check into this further if you got a false negative or the results are inconclusive but if they are saying you now need a clearance it means you must have at least one affected node from your SNB. If that IS the case you may want to ask about the POSNOC trial to really find out if you need a clearance or not as it's not a decision to be taken lightly. Do ask for a print out of what the results of infected nodes from the Metasin test actually were - I can't recall anyone else here mentioning Metasin so it doesn't seem to be used on a regular basis and there may be good reasons for that :-/ Don't be persuaded to have the clearance without knowing all the facts, if you do really need one, so be it - but you read so many messages here where after finding just a few snb cells a clearance finds no other nodes were involved - plus there's always radiotherapy as a back up.

Regarding body fluids chemo contamination to others as long as you are careful for up to a week after a chemo session it'll be fine.  Obviously chemo can cause diarrhoea which would entail maybe double flushing the loo and wearing gloves to clean up any splashes. Nothing you wouldn't do cleanliness wise anyway  :-)  One area which may not be so obvious is mouth to mouth kissing and intercourse fluid exchange. Kissing won't be a problem as exchange of fluids is very minimal and even if you feel like intercourse ( doubtful ) they would probably advise using condoms as a barrier. These chemo drugs are now a lot more refined and targeted than they were even a few years back so are a lot less of a problem to others.   Only 2 more Herceptin to go and we'll be kicked out to face the future fully loaded and fighting fit  LOL It's been 14 months since diagnosis and the time has really flown by.  Your calendar gets so full up with appt's for scans, chemo, ecg's, bloods, etc your feet hardly touch the ground.  Have to agree with the Maccy Mantra - \"It's all so Do-able\".......  including the feel like crap duvet days.

The effects of taking any of these hormone inhibitor therapy tablets will cause some weight gain, that coupled with the fact you may not now be so energetically active adds to this. As for the post surgery bra's I agree, just ignore the 'young' model images and picture yourself wearing the bra illustrated instead.  I wouldn't have thought it is anything deliberate, it's just if you contacted a model agency asking for a 60 year old model for a post mastectomy bra shoot they wouldn't have anyone on their books to send you, just as you mentioned :) As long as you are healthy enough to get out of the house and meet up,  there are lots of groups out there where the young at heart can socialise or partake in hobby based activities or gentle exercise like swimming ect - Have you tried contacting any of the local charities to see what could be on offer that may interest you ?

In cases where chemo is given prior to surgery it is usually to see if the chemo can shrink the tumours down enough to offer a viable lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy. trying to save her from losing the whole breast. Also here in the UK they will not give you Herceptin (info link) for HER2+ without chemotherapy as it is nowhere near as effective used on it's own and because Herceptin (a targeted monoclonal antibody) is very expensive they need to ensure it is $ well spent. If you have any other questions, fire away, we're all here to help :)  Been a long while since I was in Ontario, take care, G n' J Original copied message from 'under 50's breast group below...... Posted by tsmith 2 Jan 2016 3:53 AM Hello to all, My heart goes out to all beautiful women [and men] who have been diagnosed with this dreadful disease however, I do trust one day we may all be free of it. Posting for my 30 year old, new diagnosed, sis in law to see if we can get some help to understand the treatment plan/pathology and opinions on best course. Some information to help. Living in Canada, Ontario. Infiltrating carcinoma cells shows: Positive staining for HER2(+3) -- have been told there is a drug to combat/cure this Dako Herceptest + 3 >10% -strong complete membranous staining (3+) is considered positive  for HER2 a. Breast (right at 2:00 o'clock), biopsy Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Comment: Sections show an invasive  ductal carcinoma, preliminary  intermediate grade.  There is a minor component of ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate-high grade with comedonecrosis and microcalcification. Breast biomakers have been ordered and  will be reported  as an addendum. b.Breast (right at 10:00 o'clock), biopsy Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Preliminary  intermediate grade Comment: Breast biomakers have been ordered and  will be reported  as an addendum. c Axilla, (right) biospy Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Preliminary  intermediate grade no lymphoid tissue is seen Now, what I have been told from my sis in law and brother is that what has been currently planned is 8 rounds of chemo to see if the 2 tumors discovered [as well as the lymph nodes] will shrink followed by surgery if outcome is successful (what that exact surgery is, I am unclear from my conversation with them). Now, my thinking, with the limited information given, is that if this were me I would want surgery first and chemo second.  Now I have asked the question of what is the end goal of all this and please correct my ignorance here but if the end goal is to remove the breast then why not do this first, followed by chemo to kill off any residual.  I guess what I questioning at this point is the plan to tackle this.  I have seen what chemo does and I am willing to bet someone would give there left arm to have surgery rather then chemo [however having this choices are definitely positive].  I do know (and have been told) that the medical oncologists have been fighting with the surgical ones regarding differences of treatment plans on many cancers for years.  Please help shed more information on this and advise of any additional information we should be requesting before approving to this plan.  We will be meeting with the medical oncologist on Thursday and I do want to go with them to ask any questions that they may have forgotten/not thinking about [or just moral support). Also, since we are new to this disease, please provide, opinions, professionals around the world who I can email for second opinions or that are truely the best in the world who I can reach out too. Thank you so much to everyone who helps!!",

If some of your enzyme counts are 'out' they may either delay your next session by a week or so, or reduce the dosage slightly.  Any amount of chemo reduced (usually 20%) will not have any impact on it's effectiveness it just eases the side effects, stops your white count bottoming out so low and helps with liver recovery. It can also be used to help diagnose liver secondaries but if this is what they were looking for they certainly would have told you. Cancer Research uk (CRUK) have an info page about liver function tests, and by chance they also have a page about Milk Thistle and Liver cancer. There are promising trials with this but they advise against taking it during chemo as it may impact on some chemo drugs working fully.

      "Content": "Evening  Emma,  Don't know if we can help you out with dates / weeks as I think your treatment is different. Am I right in saying you having chemo, surgery then rads ? As Jackie was surgery, chemo then rads. From all her diary dates her rads were started 7 weeks from the date of her last Docetaxel and she had 15 mon-fri sessions, so her rads were about 6 months after surgery, but if you are having treatment the other way round I don't know how long the gap is between surgery and rads :-(   They will have to ensure you are capable of putting your hand/s behind your head and hold it for a few minutes while you have the rads so the more you persevere with post op excercises the more comfortable you will find that.  If you are having the chemo, surgery, rads route hopefully someone who has had that treatment regime will be able to give you more informative reply. Try not to fret about the Docetaxel,  what will be will be, and you may find it's nowhere as bad as your thoughts are telling you. Just be prepared for anything as it can lull you into a false sense of security for a few days, then on day 3 or 4 bite you in the bum. Then again maybe you'll be one who finds FEC worse, and sail through it reasonably well. Just remember to get plenty of fluids into you and you'll soon find out if you also need some pineapple, corsodyl and soft toothbrush for a yucky, sore mouth and as with the fec keep up all the tabs they give you. As a sore mouth and feeling wiped out some days and taste problems are the more common side effects, others not so common are tingly feeling or numbness in toes and fingers sometimes your feet or toes can feel hot and burning.  Keep your onco team informed of any problems as there is always something they can give you to help you through it, don't suffer in silence. As for the rads, they have you in a couple of weeks prior for assessment and planning where they talk you through it, all ask if you have any questions, then they put you in a gown and you lay on the table while they align the linear accelerator for the areas to be treated and give you some very small black dot tattoos this is for the LA alignment so they treat the exact same area everytime. These little tattoos are virtually painless. Ask if they supply cream for you to use, if not you will need a tub of E45 or any other unscented aqueous cream. A lot of hospitals allow either free parking for patients having rads, usually done by reclaiming your money back, or can be in the form of a voucher or pre paid card. Ask or look online at parking concessions where you are having your treatment about this as the daily parking can add up especially if you are kept waiting due to any delays. Here's a link to the Maccy External Beam Radiotherapy treatment info page. http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Radiotherapy/Beingtreated/Externalbeam.aspx Hope this helps a bit, try and enjoy whats left of the weekend,  George & Jackie.",

It's more looking for previously unknowns in your organs that could have an impact on the chemo.

What is more scary is that they seem to think that figure will rise by 2% over the next 15 years as more women are being dignosed at a much younger age. When I first mentioned at work J getting diagnosed and may be needing some time off, three women told me they had got through surgery and treatment for BC and up to that point I had no idea how common this is.

Not only is it used to deliver the chemo, it's also used to take the many 'bloods' taken during the 18 weeks or so. The two problems you can get are getting an infection at the entry site, or a clot forming in the line and you being put on blood thinners to break it down but these are quite uncommon. Saves you from long term vein damage from the chemo drugs, and the time spent having your session shorter and easier. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Tuppatea, I'm not medically trained but from what I can make out you friend is - Grade II (so grade2) ILC = Invasive Lobular Cancer that is 18mm in size and in the lower inner quarter of her left breast - the no LVI = there is no lymph vascular invasion which is why they say lymph normal so not found in the nodes (Axilla normal)  Stage equals size and grade equals the aggressiveness of the cancer cells to grow. The ER and PR are hormone receptors ER for Oestrogen taken from the American spelling (estrogen) and the PR being Progesterone the scale only goes up to 8 so her cancer being ER8 and PR8 is very hormone receptive for both. In layman's terms both oestrogen and progesterone hormones will be feeding the cancer cells. She will be placed on hormone inhibitor tablets for at least 5 years to wipe out her ER and PR, there are several types (tamoxifen, ansatrozole, letrozole, aromasin so which one will depend on if she is pre or post menopause and other diagnostic info. The HER2- negative means she may or may not be offered chemo mainly because of the grade, if she was HER2+ positive chemo and Herceptin would be a definite but with grade 2 and HER2- negative it is considered borderline and she may be given the choice of opting for chemo rather than being told, which is a tough decision to have to make :-/ The DCIS is ductal carcinoma in situ which is early breast cancer which is contained in one place (in situ) if this breaks out it is called invasive ductal - the reason they have mentioned this is because it is possible to have both ILC and DCIS at the same time - but it states NO DCIS so she has invasive lobular only. Don't fret about the invasive part, all cancer can be invasive all it means is it has the capacity to invade not that it already has.... I'm uncertain about the P1 10% part - I think this may be a cancer marker result ? There are several different ways a pathology result can be written up as each lab has their own way of testing and scoring. Hope this is of some use, if you have any other questions, fire away - We're all here to help. Take care, G n' J",

Even then you can never be sure because everyones body handles the drugs differently - The only common denominator is tiredness / fatigue. Some can cause nausea but they give you tablets to help counter this, some chemo drugs don't cause this nausea near as much but can cause joint / muscle aches instead :( Hairloss can start between days 10 to 22 from your first session but again some chemo drugs are more prone to cause this than others. Epirubicin is the biggest culprit for this and unfortunately is one of the more common breast cancer chemo drugs. If you are given this you can always try the Cold Cap to try and help to minimise hairloss - some use the cold cap with good success only losing up to about 40% of their hair but there is always some hairloss with Epirubicin and even with the cold cap it can look a bit patchy :( Sorry to be a bit vague but until Friday when you find out it will be all guesswork.

Can't add much more to what Lynda has said - You'll meet a really great bunch of helpful friends here to help you through the highs and lows ( yes, there are some highs ) of kicking cancers butt. Jackie my wife has just finished 3 x FEC and 3 x Tax after left MX and Sentinel node check which luckily showed clear from 3 nodes taken. Herceptin for 12 months and Letrozole for 5 years. There will be times when you have to give in and accept that you'll need some \"you time\" if only to get some sleep, get relatives and friends involved in giving you a helping hand to get through it all.  Sometime it seems like one battle after another, then you see the light at the end of the tunnel and before you know it you start looking forward to getting your life back on track, albeit slowly.  Hopefully, fingers crossed your chemo journey will be almost hassle free, ( some are lucky ) but don't bank on it. The side effects can be many and complex with different effects for everyone.  Some get bad mouth ulcers others lose finger nails, sore joints etc. Be prepared for crap days and keep a close eye on your morning temp check as it can quickly jump up overnight to mid 37's and while your white cell count is low even a mild infection can get you a 4 day hospital stay being pumped full of antibiotics. You may get an easy ride from EC but not Taxel, or vice versa. That is why this forum is so brilliant everyone here has knowledge of whatever gets thrown your way and can help to guide you through it. Any probs or concerns - Ask away - Someone, somewhere will have the answers to help put your mind at ease. There are a whole shedload of booklets you can download on the macmillan website covering almost every topic of cancer and all the treatments if they're not available from your local oncolgy centre but nothing beats the forum  :-) Very best of luck on your journey.

The more normal'ish wait between surgery and the next stage of treatment is around 6-8 weeks could be a couple of weeks before or after that time frame - especially where chemo (depending on your Oncotype results) could be offered. Main reason being they have to make certain all healing issues are resolved to lessen the slightest chance of infection should chemo be needed. As chemo can lower your white cell count making infections easier to pick up and harder to fight off. You should get to hear something soon, keep your fingers crossed for a low Oncotype score but don't be too scared if chemo is recommended - It's your long term health and lowering the risk of recurrence that is the most important thing here. Don't be concerned about the time this is taking, surgery was your main treatment to remove any tumour/s nothing drastic is going to happen over a few weeks and you get a more personalised treatment plan, rather than the old standard over treatment of chucking everything including the kitchen sink at it. Any questions, fire away, we're all here to help where we can. The only silly question is the one that isn't asked :) Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi hairworries,  Quite right on the dif between Tamoxifen Pre and Letrozole for Post menopausal patients. This is from the Breast Cancer Care uk  site - When a woman has been through the menopause, oestrogen is mainly produced in body fat. Other hormones (androgens) are converted into oestrogen within fatty tissue by an enzyme known as aromatase. Letrozole works by stopping the conversion of androgens into oestrogen, reducing the amount of oestrogen circulating in the body. Letrozole cannot be used in pre-menopausal women (those who have not yet been through the menopause) because it\u2019s ineffective if the ovaries are still making oestrogen. If there\u2019s any doubt as to whether you have completely gone through the menopause or if your menopause has occurred during chemotherapy, your doctor will probably recommend tamoxifen and only switch you to letrozole after several years without a period. Letrozole reduces the amount of oestrogen in the body and lack of oestrogen over time can cause osteoporosis (thinning of the bone). Because of this, your specialist may want to check your bone density (strength and thickness) with a dexa scan before or shortly after you start taking letrozole. Your bone density may also need to be checked approximately every two years with a repeat scan while you are taking letrozole, but this will depend on the results from the initial scan or if your specialist has any concerns. To help keep your bones healthy you can increase your intake of calcium and vitamin D. Most people do this by taking a supplement, but you may also want to eat more foods rich in calcium, such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and cereals, and for vitamin D increasing the amount of oily fish and eggs you eat. Some people will find that letrozole causes the level of cholesterol in their blood to rise. You may wish to discuss this with your onco or GP particularly if you have a history of high cholesterol. Whatever works best for you is the right way for you to go, all we can do is put the information out there to help with informed choices :-) Best wishes, G n' J",

      "Content": "Regarding the Biafine cream - It's available online from a company in the uk called blisslife co uk. With postage it works out around £25 for 400grams. There are also a few selling it on ebay,  but as with all the pirated medical stuff now out there you have to be careful that you'll be getting an original product. Wether it is of any benefit buying more expensive creams when generic aqueous is so cheap is entirely up to you. High street chemist prices for E45 is around £5 for a 350 gram tub and generic aqueous is around £3 for a 500 gram tub. Oh, and like Russ said, we lived on curries, chilli pasta bakes etc for about 2 or 3 months while J was on Docetaxel she could only taste strong flavours too. She said it made a change from cardboard and iron stews and polystyrene pies  :-)  You'll soon find out where your taste buds are going, just go with the flow...

There is more info about types of biopsy around page 8-10 in this BCC breast clinic booklet. Core biopsy is on page 9. You will feel a little sore for a couple of days afterwards but although the needle for the tissue sample used is hollow it isn't very large so please don't be expecting them to take large amounts of tissue at a time. You may well have one or two from the breast and another from the lymph node area. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Descat   Trying to figure out if you have a cat named Desmond or if you are Des and Cat as a couple :) As you mention only 2% of BC are Phyllodes and half of phyllodes are benign so you fell the wrong side of the lucky fence :( Don't know if this is the case for you but It is quite often found in those who have had a history of breast fibroids of which some can be pre-cancerous. The main reason there are so few phyllodes (current and ex patients) here is mostly down to it phyllodes only needing a quite short treatment regime. Nearly always surgery followed rads and you are sent on your way. Chemo is only usually offered if the phyllodes has broken through and is no longer contained (vascular invasion) and the 5 or 10 years of hormonal therapy is very rarely needed. Please don't feel disheartened by not finding someone else with Phyllodes - there are very many variations of breast cancer. I doubt if there are more than a handful here who are actually identical in their pathology. Not only are there around 5 more common types of BC there are variations within those as well like grade / stage, ER, PR HER2 Every BC patient here goes through the same physical and emotional turmoil of surgery and rads so in that respect nothing else is different, so don't feel you have to find someone in exactly the same boat when you are already settling in here :) btw - do check out the breast cancer groups monthly September Radiotherapy Discussion (link) for those having rads to help support each other during their sessions. Hope this is of some help, take care, G n' J",

Has you mum always been this bitter and cruel with you ? Do you think it's because you are the youngest and have always had to come last with everything including hugs.... Sounds to me like you are a caring, loving wife and mother, perhaps your mother resents the fact you are nothing like her and could have always been jealous of you for some reason ? There will come a time when your mum or one of your brothers needs some help and support - what goes around, comes around. Know it is a tough decision but I would look to the future without them being part of it - You don't need their petty ways making you feel so guilty about yourself. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya MrsD, Sorry you have had to wait a while for a reply. Feeling sick before you even start is very normal - fear of the unknown, but if you get to see the chemo room you will find everyone at ease reading or using their iPads, listening to music etc it is in no way a stressy atmosphere, far from it. From what I can figure out this will be your first meeting with the chemo nurse ? So you will be told which chemotherapy drugs you will be given and how often - most commonly every three weeks. They may also measure and weigh you to work out the dosage according to drug calculations. It's just so they can give you the maximum dose that they feel you can deal with without overdoing it. They may also carry out an ECG to get your normal heart trace readings to give them base figures to compare any other future readings to. They may take blood samples too to check your liver can handle the chemo they are planning on using. Blood samples are taken a day or two before every session to make certain your liver is ready to deal with another dose. The chemo regime mostly offered is FEC-T but there are other regimes like AC or EC etc so pop back in and reply when you find out a bit more. If it is FEC-T you could get either first. If it's primary job is to shrink a tumour down so you can have a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy it may be the T part first, but different oncologists go about things using their experience. Things to ask - If you have read on here about the cold cap and would like to try this ask about using that and if they actually have this facility, not all units do. Also ask if they allow anyone in to sit with you during your session, again most are ok with this but some units don't allow it and have a waiting area for whoever comes with you. If you have had problems with small veins and iv needles in the past mention this, they may offer you a PICC or Central iv line for chemo and bloods (if you are lucky) otherwise they will wait and see how your first session goes and take it from there. Ask if they supply an antiseptic mouthwash (chlorhexidine or similar) to ward off oral infections again most willingly hand it over others rely on you to buy your own at a high street chemists. Having said all that it may just be a quick chat about what chemo you are having when it is going to start, take a look at the chemo suite and come in a couple of days before your first session for all the above. Hopefully other members will reply with some ideas too, as by answering this it will 'bump' the post up the list. If I think of anything to add - I'll edit it in later. Hope this is of some help, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Chrissy,  I think a lot of these claims about food and drink are way over stated. Either to 'hype' the sale of a product, create media sales or just to stir the pot.  True a lot of the so called 'live' foods should be avoided during chemo when neutropeanic but as for dairy oestrogens causing cancer - Nothing has been proved. In fact Cancer Research uk (cruk) says this -  \"Dairy products have been studied for their effect on breast cancer risk. Some recent studies have shown that women with a high intake of dairy products have a lower risk of breast cancer, but we need results from more studies before we can be sure about this. Dairy products are high in calcium, and several studies show a lower risk of breast cancer for women with high calcium intakes or calcium blood levels\" Most of us especially as children consume a shed load of dairy from milk and milk shakes, milk based puddings like rice and custard, ice cream for those of us pre Thatcher who had milk at school every day. If it was a problem with oestrogens in cows milk I'm sure hardly any of us would have reached middle age yet alone the much higher average life expectancy we now have. Not only the UK and US, ALL cows milk comes from pregnant cows ? If anything there may be more in meat from animals fed on hormone supplemented feeds and from natural plant oestrogens ? Who knows, t's a battlefield with far too many if's and but's. Perhaps the China Syndrome is down to something else like not eating so much red meat having fish and chicken instead, or a higher soya and rice intake. Maybe being less affected by cancer is in their genetic makeup ? Until proper trials are carried out it's all guesswork. Perhaps the chinese detection rate is very poor so not as many get diagnosed ?  All I know is there are more people making a living from cancer, than there are dying from it. So just enjoy eating and drinking whatever takes your fancy, and if you are of the other side of the fence eating and drinking all the good stuff and supplements, also taking care in what you eat and drink in general that's ok too as long as you are happy with your choices. For me, life's too short for all the dietary hassle, denial and head scratching :-)  Just saying :-) Take care, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Evening KatieF  Warm welcome to the group, sorry to see you have to dance with the devil again after all this time :( If you are having a mastectomy it will probably be at least a few weeks before you start chemo as they like you nicely healed first to lower the risk of infections when your white cell count is lowered. At least it gives you lots of time to gather info and some tips to help you through your sessions. Don't know what chemo you may have had for your previous cancer and if that has any impact on the choice of chemo drugs you can be offered now but it they are offering you Herceptin you must have been found to be HER2+ positive, herceptin is nearly always coupled with chemo and may well be why they know prior to any surgery chemo will be needed. Have you got a surgery date yet or is this all still very recent - Just thinking it would be nice for you to get Christmas over before starting chemo as taste issues will take the edge of the all the food and celebrations :( There is a monthly 'Chemo Club' in the group where those having or have had chemo support each other during their sessions you could check out Novembers. Any questions simply ask, there is always someone here happy to help. Take care, G n' J",

Maccy has a port and central line info webpage if you want to check it out should be easy enough to find using the search box. Must admit we're impressed with your attitude to this, no sign of a rabbit in the headlights, just a Tabbi-Tiger stalking those bloody C cells. Do you know when you start FEC #1 ?

If it's the usual post treatment chat, all that will be discussed is how you are feeling - any problems during treatment or ongoing issues you are still having. If everyone is happy they bid you farewell until your next review. If you are still having problems or side effects from any part of what you have been through, now is the time to ask questions about it ?

It could be scar tissue tightening up or possibly rads rib damage but that one is probably doubtful this long after rads... You are doing the right thing getting in contact with the Marsden to check this out, hopefully it is a side effect of previous treatment and nothing more. You may well be asked to go in for bloods and possibly a scan which would be scary but at least that way you will get some answers. It's a long shot but did you get any metal clips placed in the breast prior to the lumpectomy that were left in - assume you didn't have any chemo or you would have mentioned it ? You could do a group search for Costochondritis using the search box above to see if anyone ele has posted about it.... Do let us know what advice you get from Open Access as it may help others who get the same problem. Good luck with getting answers, G n' J",

An enzyme in it can stop the chemo from working or even have an opposite effect that can make your body react like it's getting an overdose of chemo with increased side effects.........

Where the nipple isn't removed but all the breast tissue behind and within the breast skin itself  is removed. Her own breast skin and nipples are retained and these are used for the reconstruction.  Does this sound like what was explained to her, or don't you know much about it ? It may help you to join the BRCA Group (link) which we also have and ask this question there as this type of mastectomy would be more common for risk reducing BRCA patients. Hope this is of some help, someone here will have experience of this type and can advise you better. Take care, G n' J",

With that in mind fingers crossed they aren't so cruel to start your chemo sessions before the holiday period :-/ You could ask your oncologist (when you meet them) if this is do'able - even with grade 3 nothing drastic is going to happen if chemo is delayed by a week or so.

      "Content": "Hi silvercloud When Jackie was diagnosed HER2+ positive in May 2012 the oncologist went to great lengths to tell us if we had lived across the border in the next county Herceptin wouldn't have been offered as it was then still a postcode lottery drug due to cost :( At that time prior to Herceptin (one of the then new targeted biological therapies) HER2+ positive was 'up there' as among the worst types of BC to get and because HER2+ was considered aggressive with only a 75% chance of surviving more than 5 years and 4 x times more chance that it could reccur within those 5 years. Luckily NICE approved Herceptin for everyone and it is a real game changer as far as prognosis goes bringing it almost in line with recovery figures for other types of BC. With J's full diagnosis and crunching the numbers she was told without Herceptin her chances of recurrence within 5 years was 40% a scarily high figure which made the decision to have chemo and herceptin a no brainer. Unfortunately you have to have the chemo to get the Herceptin it just doesn't work as well without it and NICE won't fund Herceptin without certain types of chemo drugs being given, as per all the original trial results. In a way it is good they found you to be HER2+ as it means there is excellent treatment for it, just a bit of a shock when you were hoping to avoid the chemo and you get tripped up - as you say that tough decision has been taken out of your hands. It just goes to show how much these new targeted biological therapies have improved the outcome for so many in such a short time, even over the last few years :) Four years on the only thing holding J back now is that pesky Letrozole but if it keeps the devil away from your door, so be it :( You can do this, hugs, G n' J",

You may feel a little down and depressed for a few days, this will be a side effect of the anaesthetic and can take up to a week to get out of your system. If you drive it may pay you to buy or make a small pillow / cushion pad to go between your breast and the seat belt for when you feel up to driving again. If you haven't been given much info about surgery here is the link to 'Your Operation and Recovery' which covers a lot of the basics. Things like a tops that button at the front so it is easier to get in and out of maybe a little printed cotton bag for any drains - Depending on how sore you are, a loose fitting bra with no wires to dig in.  No doubt you'll get loads of tips, so we'll skidaddle for now.

Most people take their temp first thing in the morning before taking any tablets to counter this effect, but in your case it may well have something to do with you being allergic to penicillin ? I think you should ask someone else there about taking paracetamol mentioning your allergy and see if you get a different answer ?

      "Content": "Hi  Cat,  My assessment was 3 weeks prior to starting my 15 x sunbed sessions. This was at Addenbrookes other treatment centres may vary slightly. It may be worth you giving your dept a ring and asking them. Addy's have 6 linear accelerators - sunbed rayguns :-)  So they have a lot of options. At the assessment with a radiologist and assistant they'll ask you loads of Q's about your general health, if you have any problems keeping your hand behind your head for 10 - 15 mins as they require this to treat armpits lymph area and will answer Q's on anything you have concerns about. They really put my mind at ease before giving me a half gown to wear before taking me to an LA room where I lay whilst they made various adjustments to my position and then aligned the machine up and made 3 small black tattoo marks. They are used to line the machine up to when you start your treatment, so they don't have to keep measuring every visit. So be careful you don't wash them too hard when showering etc as they did tend to get smaller prior to treatment. A couple of images are taken to ensure the area being treated doesn't include any heart or lung tissue ( with mine they said it only just clipped the very top of my left lung ) The rays are directed in at angles so they sort of skim the area ( in at the side and out through the chest and vice versa ) so they don't actually go wholly right through you.  So treatment is just kept to the area it's needed in. Get a good supply of unperfumed aqueous cream in to use once treatment starts. Honestly a lot of people have major worries about radiotherapy apart from the accumulative tiredness and daily travel it was a walk in the park........ It'll be over before you know it :-) One thing that you may need to double check on is seeing as your rads will be daily they may clash with any other onco or dr's appointments you have already booked, if so these will need juggling a bit. Best  wishes,  Jackie and George",

      "Content": "Hi Bevdin, Not trying to confuse you even more, but the answer to both questions is yes. They take biopsies when they find something that doesn't look like normal breast tissue on the ultrasound screen and need to know more about it's make up from examining the sample/s under a microscope in a pathology lab. This will determine if this is a benign lump / cyst / fibroid or calcification or if the sample does indeed contain breast cancer cells. Some (very few - one stop shops) can let you know the same day, more often you have to go back a week later for the results so I would take someone with you anyway. Not only will it give you a 'friend' to chat with to help take your mind off it a little but another pair of eyes and ears always helps in case you miss something. The scan operator won't be able to diagnose anything but you can ask them questions about approximate size, it's position (if it appears to be in one area or scattered) etc This may help 'Understanding Breast Screening' knowing a little in advance what may happen. Take care and good luck, G n' J",

You must be well pleased to have reached this point - Do look back and be proud to be a survivor :-) rather than worrying about recurrence. This review scan issue as you suggest may vary for different health authority areas. J had her 3 year BC clinic review and scan in May (we're in Suffolk) but if it is shown to save money and be of little value it may well be rolled out nation wide, only time will tell. No doubt you will still get the yearly letter inviting you for mammogram or ultrasound scans on boob #2 If not there are always mobile screening vans visiting health centres you can just pop into if you don't get officially called in. As you still browse the group, do jump in and reply to reassure any new members that this is do'able.

      "Content": "Hi  Jackie, Assume they explained it's easier to check for any reactions if they start these 24 hours apart. Together on the same day would muddy the waters. You don't say which chemo drug regime you will be on, but if it is Docetaxel and you get no immediate reactions they may be given after each other but on the \"same day\" next time around. If you could post the chemo treatment schedule they are giving you we'll be able to answer any Q's better as each has their own varied side effects. i.e FEC-T or T and Herceptin then FEC ? Have you already had any surgery ?   To be honest you won't know how chemo will affect you until you are a few days into it, some get hardly any ill effects apart from extreme tiredness and achey muscles and joints, the unlucky ones will get a rougher ride. It's a very individual thing and although a lot of the side effects are more common everyone's experience will be different. Unfortunately some days you do feel like sh*t, but not many are really bad. Although it will seem a long time to be having chemo, the time soon goes and before you realise it you are having your last one and looking forward to a brighter future. Hope this helps, George & Jackie",

What decisions do you need help with ? is it whether to have chemo..... Chemo is great for shrinking tumours down which in some cases can make the difference between a lumpectomy (WLE) or mastectomy - It also acts as insurance agains re-occurance as it 'treats' the whole body so if any cells have escaped they get found and zapped. It's tough, but as others here will tell you do'able. No doubt you have loads of questions, so fire away - We're all here to help and there's loads of us around at various stages of treatment. So there is always a few at exactly the same stage to share notes and tips with. Won't say welcome as none of us really wants to be here, but it's great place for friendly advice, support if and when you need it but most of all trying to make the rocky road walk a bit smoother.

Sort of damned if you and damned if you don't. I know one thing and a lot here (who have gone through chemo) would probably agree if you were one of a 100 women in a room and you knew that 7 of you won't be around in less than ten years I wouldn't want to take the chance that one of them could be me.... Eeek!!  Now that is scary....just for sake of 18 weeks of FEC. As for winter children and colds etc out of the three weeks between sessions you are only at risk of infection for about 5 days between days 7 and 12'ish. Know it all sounds very scary especially as you probably don't know anyone who has had chemo before, we've all seen the horror stories in soaps and in documentaries but it really isn't as bad as they portray it and those 18 weeks soon get ticked off the calendar.

TC combination of chemo is a bit different to what is usually handed out so there may only be a few of the lovely ladies here who have had that combination - It's nearly always FEC-T (FEC is 3 sep chemo drugs) The C you are being offered is the C part of the fec  coupled with the T The C is for Cyclophosphamide and the T is for Taxotere also know as Docetaxel. There is an information page you can read clicking here about TC to give you something to browse until you get some other replies. There is also an August Chemo Club here where everyone having chemo helps each other along with advice and support. If you click the above august chemo club link it contains some chemo aids info in the first post on the page. Realise you are scheduled for Sept but the club is run every month, so you won't miss out. If you could reply with any other questions you may have about chemo (or anything else) do ask, there's no such thing as a silly question here. Is this chemo prior to surgery or have you already had surgery ? Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Bat, HER2+ is a gene fault but isn't one that is hereditary like BRCA so it isn't passed down. What is HER2 ? Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a gene that creates HER2 proteins. HER2 proteins act as receptors on breast cells and promote breast cell growth. Every woman has HER2 in her breast cells. In a healthy breast cell, HER2 is responsible for repairing the cell and growing more cells. If the HER2 gene mutates, it causes an uncontrolled increase in HER2 protein. This causes cells to grow and divide out of control, which may lead to cancer. Which is why HER2+ is considered 'aggressive' About one in every five (20 percent) of breast cancer cases, HER2 genes don\u2019t function correctly. HER2-positive breast cancer is not inherited from a parent. Instead, it\u2019s considered a somatic genetic mutation. Somatic gene mutations occur after conception. Having a close relative with HER2-positive breast cancer does not increase your risk for breast cancer or HER2-positive breast cancer. Treatments that specifically target HER2 are very effective. These treatments are so effective that the prognosis for HER2-positive breast cancer is actually quite good. Treatments include: Trastuzumab (Herceptin) Lapatinib (Tykerb) Pertuzumab (Perjeta) Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) So it is a gene fault caused by a gene that 'switches' at sometime after conception not a parental gene fault that is passed down through families. With a 1 in 5 chance of any breast cancer patient having this her2 gene fault it's purely coincidental if this occurs in a mother / daughter or sister / auntie scenario. Hope this helps, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya Vonnie, There are so many different combinations of supplements and therapies out there, coupled with the fact that everyone handles chemo drugs differently it is far easier for them to blanket ban all of them for the duration of chemo as it would be impossible to check every one against all the (100 +) chemo drugs. Some supplements are under normal circumstances fairly harmless (even helpful)  others not so and can either cause the chemo to be not as effective or increase the side effects. Ooh bugger! Cellulitis that can take a while to sort out :-( It can be caused by something really random too.  Here's a bit of info from Lymphoedema Org. If you select the consensus link at the bottom it brings up a good but bit techy read all about anti-biotics and ongoing treatments Clarithromycin is mentioned a few times. What is cellulitis? Cellulitis is a sudden, non contagious infection of the skin, characterised by redness, swelling and heat, accompanied by pain and tenderness. People with lymphoedema are particularly susceptible to cellulitis because the lymphatic system is damaged or overloaded and does not function adequately to fight infection.    What causes cellulitis? The infection may enter via a break in the skin, such as a scratch or insect bite or through a pre-existing wound or ulcer, or through an area of skin inflammation, e.g. athlete\u2019s foot, eczema or dermatitis. However, it may not be possible to identify the cause and an attack may arise without warning.    How can I recognise cellulitis? The patient often feels unwell, as if \u2018flu is starting. Symptoms can include fever, shivers, muscular aches and pains, headache, nausea, vomiting etc. The swollen area usually develops a rash or becomes red, hot and tender to the touch. Swelling may dramatically increase and pain may occur in the swollen area, or the armpit, with lymphoedema of the arm, or groin with lymphoedema of the leg.    What should I do if I develop cellulitis? Contact your doctor immediately as you will need antibiotic treatment. Treatment of cellulitis in lymphoedema is very important, not only because the sufferer may become very ill, but because lymph drainage routes risk being damaged further, in which case, the swelling may worsen and permanent skin changes, e.g. thickening, may result. This does not help the long-term management of the condition.    For information on the type of antibiotics used in the treatment of cellulitis in lymphoedema, see the Cellulitis Consensus Document (in pdf format).   Lets hope that when your cellulitis is cleared up it stays cleared up and doesn't re-visit you. At least now you know the signs. You could get a med-alert bracelet for this should you feel it necessary ? G n' J",

Most people take their temp first thing in the morning before taking any tablets to counter this effect, but in your case it may well have something to do with you being allergic to penicillin ? I think you should ask someone else there about taking paracetamol mentioning your allergy and see if you get a different answer ?

Your onco will know your ER score (8 is the highest figure) which means strongly receptive only between you can you figure out which will be best way for you long term. Carrying on with the Tamoxifen or switching to aromtase inhibitor type tablets like letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane. The AI type tablets can cause bone aches and thinning which can lead to osteopaenia - so they are all a bit rubbish really. If you had chemo as a whole body treatment chances are your recurrence risk would be low enough to not have the tablets and take your chances but if you didn't have chemo the tablets are the only thing acting on your whole body. Radiotherapy is only a 'localised' treatment. Unfortunately recurrence doesn't always come back in the breast. The other breast, bone, lung, liver are also areas that can be affected :( I would phone your oncologist for an appt to work out your risks. G n' J",

Have you had any surgery yet, or still right at the very start of all this ? Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi mummylove, Sorry to read your mum is feeling a bit down. It is normal to have dips in mood and it doesn't take much to tip you over the edge. Did your mum have chemo before her surgery or is she not having chemo ? As this can also affect the emotions, as can any hormone inhibitor tablets like Letrozole, Anastrozole or tamoxifen etc ? Sounds like what you mum is going through is similar to post traumatic stress. Although happy to be free of cancer, she looks down and hates what is has done to her 'young' body :-(  When you say her reconstruction feels 'alien' did she have a type of recon that used skin / tissue from her tummy or back as this can feel strange as it is not breast tissue ? It is possible that she has had the reconstruction with an implant of some sort and this is stretching her tissue if it is still very painful she should contact her breast care nurse and get it checked over in case of minor infection or other problems caused by the surgery. A lot of nerves are cut during recon and it can take ages for these to repair themselves and get anything like some normal feeling back, that coupled with any scar tissue is enough to make anyone less than impressed with the outcome, but it does get better, it just takes a long time. No doubt you will get some supportive replies from other ladies here who have had recon surgery. Just being there for her will be a great comfort, so don't beat yourself up and feeling guilty that you could do more this all takes time and although she probably hasn't yet realised it is time she now has - if she hadn't had it checked out as soon as she did this could have been so much worse. Take care, your'e both doing great!  G n' J  ",

      "Content": "Hi Teresa, OK the Picc line or any central iv line is a constant reminder of what you are going through and can get in the way at times but the benefits far outweigh the inconvenience as you will soon see. All your bloods can be taken from it and your delicate veins will be protected from 'burn' damage or collapsing altogether post chemo. Everyone should be given a line of some sort, you see far too many posts here from those who have long term vein pain and circulation problems which could be so easily avoided. Why their use varies from one health authority area to another is anyone's guess (probably cash related) Very few have problems with ports and lines although it does happen occasionally. Takes around 30 - 40 minutes to fit and it aches for around 36 hours until it settles down but makes having chemo quicker and a lot less hassle than being constantly stabbed with needles while they try to find a good vein for the cannula :) Best wishes, G n' J",

Unfortunately if the signs are \"to a doctor\" fairly obvious they are usually correct. I would like to think they would never diagnose cancer of any sort without being confident they were correct. Some more obscure symptoms like slightly inverted nipple or small hard to find lumps they usually refer to confirm, which your gp will do now anyway. Fingers crossed on further investigation there may be better news ahead, but do be prepared for bad news which will seem ten times worse if you are in denial. You are both now about to get a two weeks ride on the emotional roller coaster of getting appointments for scans, biopsies and results from those before you will know anything for absolute certainty. You will find this waiting time very scary as your minds go into overdrive with worry. After this diagnosis stage a treatment plan is put in place it all happens very quickly Try not to Google anything. A lot of the information out there is either way out of date or wrong. Stick with reputable uk websites like Macmillan and breastcancercare.uk Please do keep in contact with us here whatever news you get, it's a magical place full of wonderful ladies. There is another group you may find useful if your worst fears are confirmed this is the relative/carer group just click on the green text link to have a look at the topics covered.

I had a look around NICE and the only info I found on axillary clearance pathway was this 1.4 Surgery to the axilla Invasive breast cancer 1.4.1 Minimal surgery, rather than lymph node clearance, should be performed to stage the axilla for patients with early invasive breast cancer and no evidence of lymph node involvement on ultrasound or a negative ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the preferred technique. 1.4.2 SLNB should only be performed by a team that is validated in the use of the technique, as identified in the New Start training programme[6]. 1.4.3 Perform SLNB using the dual technique with isotope and blue dye. 1.4.4 Breast units should audit their axillary recurrence rates. Ductal carcinoma in situ 1.4.5 Do not perform SLNB routinely in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS who are having breast conserving surgery, unless they are considered to be at a high risk of invasive disease[7]. 1.4.6 Offer SLNB to all patients who are having a mastectomy for DCIS. Evaluation and management of a positive sentinel lymph node 1.4.7 Offer further axillary treatment to patients with early invasive breast cancer who: have macrometastases or micrometastases shown in a sentinel lymph node have a preoperative ultrasound-guided needle biopsy with histologically proven metastatic cancer. The preferred technique is axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) because it gives additional staging information. 1.4.8 Do not offer further axillary treatment to patients found to have only isolated tumour cells in their sentinel lymph nodes. These patients should be regarded as lymph node-negative.",

The waiting results stage can crush you if you let it get to you. We're certain the medics have no idea how bad the waiting 10 days to 2 weeks or more can affect you mentally. It's worse than the treatment, we found at least when it was confirmed we knew what was now coming and could prepare for all the treatment. Hopefully It will be a cyst, or a growing but benign tumour, maybe blocked milk ducts, or calcification... Unfortunately no amount of worrying is going to alter the outcome of your tests. We all hope you get away with it and never have to come back after telling us it was \"all clear\"  but do take someone with you Friday because if your worst fears are confirmed as soon as you hear the C word your brain go into overdrive, tears will flow and your ears will stop hearing, you won't take much in after that so another set of ears and a someone to hug is a good thing. From then on your feet don't get chance to touch the ground so you don't get time to worry as you go through a constant cycle of hospital visits for more tests, treatment etc There are loads of us here 5, 10, 15 years and longer well past treatment. Breast cancer has one of the highest rates of success now and is no longer the \"doom and gloom\" it was even a few years ago. My wife works with a woman who had a breast off 18 years ago with no sign of any re-occurance.That was in the days when doctors wore pointy hats and sang voodoo chants in hospitals, the way they cure it has come a very long way since then :-) Chin up Linds, what will be will be, fingers crossed for you. Meanwhile do anything and go anywhere that helps kill the waiting time and takes your mind off it all. Easier said than done we know but it would ease your worries.

      "Content": "Morning D, It is do'able with some juggling around. Jackie packed in work (also Letrozole related) after being on them for just over a year. Found she could no longer do the job she loved which was carer in a residential nursing home because of all the stairs, corridor walking and manual handling involved. She even struggled with the phased return so things weren't looking good from the onset but stuck at it getting up to 16hrs a week until the letrozole gradually took it's toll on her joints ect. What savings we had did take a big hit while we figured it all out but now things are great :) Things you could take into consideration are - How long before your husband retires and his current earnings level ? and is he willing to share his stash (unlike the husband who slammed his wallet shut) \"Whatever happened to what's mine is yours\"  :( Would you be entitled to Pension Credit (also paid before retirement age) which would also gain you access to other benefits like Council Tax reductions etc.  Find out more from Gov UK DWP or AGE.UK website. You could probably get the £200 Winter fuel allowance too. Make sure any credit cards, loans etc are paid off first so you aren't giving money away through interest payments. After we went through all this. I got all my tax back since the start of the tax year and pay zero tax. get monthly Pension Credit payments and our council  tax was halved. Obviously each case is different and the questions can seem never ending but it pays to not be put off. So many people are entitled but either don't realise this, or are put off by all the form filling, sending off bank statements, payslips etc.  We got all this even after they took into consideration my quite good ex company pension which I'm taking as a monthly part pension payment until I get the full whack when I officially retire - this seemed to make no difference regarding income ? Must admit though I did go part time when J was diagnosed so at 20 hours per week my pay is a lot lower now. If I had been still working full time we would have got none of this. Strange thing is we ended up better off with my reduced hours than we would have been if I was still working full time :) Pension Credit option was a good choice as a starting point as all the questions are asked over the phone (no forms to fill in) There may be alternative illness related benefits you could claim if you don't qualify for any of those mentioned. Best thing is to ring the free phone 0808 808 0000 support line and speak to the financial dept, they are brilliant :) In your life's routine, you just don't realise how much money you waste on non essential 'stuff' until you trim back. What is unexpected and even better is that going without said 'stuff' isn't even missed. i.e - We downsized the car from an automatic petrol estate to a smaller diesel runaround - result almost no car tax, twice as many miles to a smaller tankfull, cheaper insurance which is saving us at least £100 per month :-0  Oh, and we don't visit Ikea so much now as the larger stuff won't fit in LOL Our verdict on taking early retirement = Best move we ever made :) Hope you can get your head around it all and successfully take the plunge, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Blackrabbit, The scalp pain is caused by the weight of your hair 'pulling' on the follicles. If you get your hair cut really short it will bring almost instant relief and the slight residual pain will go over a day or two. It also helps emotionally too as you only lose the fuzz rather than your long hair. It can be a bit painful getting it cut at this late stage so get whoever does it to be gentle with it :-) If most has already gone it may take a few days for the pain to go as it's been 'pulled' at for around a week now :-( It is a bit of a shock but once the hair is gone it slips way down the list of priorities - Do try to see a kick cancer in the ar*e lady in the mirror looking back at you, and not a cancer victim.

      "Content": "Afternoon Heidi, Welcome to the group... Congratulations on getting through the chemo, hope it wasn't too tough on you - was it to shrink the tumour down? Whoa!!! Stop those thoughts right now - it is a few cells they have found not tumours..... It is the lymph nodes job to trap dodgy cells whether they are from flu, mumps or cancer..... So be reassured they have done their job and put these on hold and stopped them from going elsewhere. There are lots of ladies here who have had full node removal surgery (axilla clearance) so as you can see it is quite common - and they can advise you about clearance surgery. Obviously everyone would prefer clear nodes but it isn't uncommon to have some nodes affected with cells - a month or so after your clearance surgery you will no doubt have radiotherapy sessions to the breast and armpit area as well. This is all insurance against any recurrence. Are you ER+ positive or ER- negative, by the way ? There are no guarantees against recurrence, but that is not just you , that applies to everyone here. Be assured that BC has a 90% recovery rate, so don't worry about the future,  look forward to it. Take care G n' J (class of 2012)",

As there wasn't a reply option for your blog post, I'm replying here instead  :) So assume you are now getting to the recon stage and are trying to get your head around all the options and seeking advice from those who have had this recon surgery. Basically there are two main types implant and recon using your own tissue (back or tummy) Until you get more experienced replies from those who have had reconstruction surgery you could have a quick read through this Understanding Breast Reconstruction booklet (link) which explains the various option and has post surgery images.

You could try this NHS Predict Tool for free - or an alternative to the Oncotype-DX test is Endopredict which can be carried out at selected UK sites ?  The predict tool is not personalised and based on averages but will give you % figures over 5 / 10 years with or without 3rd genertion chemo regime - it is free meaning you could use the Oncotype test cash for a post surgery late winter holiday instead. I assume you are ER+ and/or PR+ positive so will be on tablets long term as a back up ? and has radiotherapy been mentioned or offered ?   I don't think many here would put themselves through 18 weeks of chemo (with the risk of some long term side effects) for a 1% or 2% decreased risk of recurrence.

In the UK we use the Allred scoring scale for ER and PR (Zero to Eight) which is why the scores can be written as ER8  /  PR4 etc This may be a quesion for one of the Macmillan Nurses - You can find them here in the Ask a Nurse area. It isn't unusual to be given a higher grade from say 1 to 2 from any post surgery tissue pathology results but I don't think this is the reason for your question :) Perhaps it is just that in the US insurance companies need all this extra information as their drugs / meds have to be paid for ? If you do ask a nurse it can take a couple of days for them to reply; what er/pr status scores were you given ? Take care, G n' J",

If they are wanting you to resume Tamoxifen in a few weeks I'm assuming they didn't remove your ovaries with the hysterectomy ? There are alternatives to Tamoxifen but they are used mostly for those who are post menopause whose ovaries have stopped producing oestrogen.  It is possible to switch off the ovaries to stop producing oestrogen by using drugs like Zoladex you could possibly have one of the other types of tablet then, but tbh they all come with side effects of one sort or another :( You need to have a chat with your oncologist about any options available but now you have had the hysterectomy you would think you no longer have the the main problem area.

Cannot state this enough it may be a blip and you can come straight back home wasting only an hour, but it could be an infection that will floor you :( If your neutrophils are low you have no immunity......... Most of these infections you catch from yourself like oral thrush and other yeast infections, UTI's, bacterial infections (some of which can be serious) with a healthy white count they normally get easily wiped out early on. Know it's a pain in the ar*e having to go to the unit but that is so much better than an emergency 4 day minimum 7 day possible inpatient stay on iv anti-biotics. The average neutrophil count it between 2.0 and 7.5  (2,000 - 7,500) so you can see a count of 0.1 is about as low as you can get :(  This equates to - A general guide is: slightly low neutrophils (1.0\u20132.0) \u2013 little change in your risk of infection (1,000 - 2,000) low neutrophils (0.5\u20131.0) \u2013 slightly higher risk of infection  (500 - 1,000) very low neutrophils (0.2\u20130.5) \u2013 infections common  (200 - 500) extremely low neutrophils (up to 0.2) \u2013 infections very likely.  If you have a neutrophil count of 0.1 means only 100 neutrophils for every mL of blood  - Like expecting to put out a fire with a teaspoon of water :( I doubt if they will add a top-up session you could ask next Thursday, if nothing else the reduction will definitely help with any side effects and peripheral neuropathy risks :) Hugs, G n' J",

If they are in the 'no, sorry' brigade and won't refund, you could get it exchanged for a different therapy in advance ? Macmillan and Cancer Research UK both say there is no evidence to support or disprove the idea that spa-ing with cancer is dangerous. This dilemma has historically led spas to err on the side of caution and refuse to treat those who are not yet through a five-year remission period. In fact some hospitals offer massage as a complimentary therapy but private spas are too worried about legal action  G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Operahappy, Nice to see you found your way here, it's a great place to be at a tough time. Could you name your poison - is it FEC, Taxotere/Docetaxel or one of the other chemo drugs ? Just so the other ladies here can reply if they are having the same and it gives us a guide to what effects you will be having at any particular days of your cycle. If you are on FEC you should perk up in a couple of days (around days 10 - 12) however if you are on the Taxotere/Docetaxel part it will take a couple of days longer. There is a rolling chemo discussion here every month - To find the November Chemo Club just select the green text link to chat to others having chemo at this time. There is some helpful links in the very first message. BTW - Did you ever see our reply to your message to Jazmine ? We were trying to help you with getting your 'operahappy' blog posted but I think you must have missed it.... To help you keep track of any discussions of interest, there is an 'Add To Favourites' button under every title. If you select that all those will be added to the 'Favourites' tab on your profile page. It may pay you to do this for the chemo club discussion as you will probably return to it quite often during your sessions. Look forward to chatting some more, they are a great crowd here and you will soon get some replies to help you settle in. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Sue  Su12345  Sorry to read the reality is starting to sink in, the cancer angst had to come out sometime - Cr@p isn't it  :( Chemotherapy is the one treatment option everyone hopes to avoid and it's hard to say so early on if you will dodge that bullet or not. Most of the info regarding the need for chemo comes from the surgery tissue pathology report and it's quite uncommon to get a positive answer one way or the other beforehand. Unless you are offered chemotherapy prior to surgery to shrink any tumours down first - which sometimes happens, but mostly for hopefully changing what would be a mastectomy into a lumpectomy. Two main types of breast cancer which practically guarantees chemo is if you are classed as Triple Negative (which is why Fiona needed chemo) or what they term HER2+ positive.  For other types the decision is based on lymph node involvement, grade/stage and several other factors. There are chemo risk assessment tests to give you the % of recurrence with or without chemotherapy but again you will need to know your pathology report information to see if you meet the criteria for the tests.  If your surgeon thinks you will only need surgery and radiotherapy, that is good but please be aware things can change post surgery when all the results are in. That is why chemo probably wasn't mentioned at the time.  Don't worry about that for now, it's no good fretting about something you may not need. As they say cross that bridge if and when you come to it. Hope your sons elbow isn't too bad, what month is the wedding planned for btw ? Take care, G n' J",

This means if you are a larger lady you may need to use two packs of R1 at a time.  Don't forget with the R2 to use it for up to two weeks after your sessions as the rads keep working for that period. Any you have left over can be offered to anyone who would like them - as they are not a prescription only medicine (POM) and can be purchased over the counter if your GP won't prescribe them :) I do recall someone else here who gave her leftover sachets to another member who wanted to try it.

As you know TNBC can be tough on the nerves regarding recurrence and you will have to be vigilant, not enough to worry yourself sick over it, but just do keep listening to your own body and if in doubt about any twinges - get them checked out. The CA125 Helen mentioned is a marker for ovarian cancer which could be significant if your have the faulty BRCA gene ? - The markers mostly looked for with breast cancer  are........  CA 15.3 and CA 27.29, for monitoring treatment; these should be used along with the patient's health history, a physical examination, and diagnostic imaging tests, such as an x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CEA, (carcinoembryonic antigen) for monitoring treatment; this test should be used along with the patient's health history, a physical examination, and diagnostic imaging tests. So these will be what they are looking for in 'bloods' depending on how often you have to have them for monitoring purposes. There may well be a secret, or open facebook groups for Triple Neg which may be worth looking into if you are 'into' fb ?  Hope this is of some help, take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Evening  Tracey,  Where's our upbeat, half glass full gal gone   :-(    Is it you coming to terms with the post trauma stress of the past 12 months, the worry about your upcoming mammo, or have you a worrying niggle that has triggered this off ? Getting emotional and having tearful times are your inbuilt safety valve but being depressed can get a hold of you and drag you down further. If you feel you are struggling to get your smiles back ask your gp for a little help. You don't have to have Cheshire Cat cheesy grin strength tabs just a mild booster (Garfield type) to help you through this dark patch. A month is a long time to wait worrying (make that 6 weeks with the results) of your mammo. Perhaps it's the Tamoxifen tabs gradually taking away all your feel good hormones ?  Either way, we'd love to see you back to your happy self.This is tough enough without finding a self destruct button  Take care Tracey and please accept a \"HUGE Group Hug\"  George & Jackie.",

Which is actually the best for this purpose to be honest I couldn't say - That would be a question to ask someone in radiology. None of these scans however will pick up any individual cells only clusters - a PET scan can determine if any cancer is 'living' or already treated dead tissue. There is some info about PET scans here at CRUK which may help if you compare that with MRI and CT scan information at the same site. PET scanners are very expensive so not many hospitals have one and the cost of a pet scan privately would be quite high. Unfortunately no one will ever say you are 'clear' as once diagnosed nothing is ever guaranteed the best you would get is NED (no evidence of disease) at the time of checking.

There is a shedload of Benign Breast Conditions (info link) that can cause lumps from fibroids, cysts, calcification etc but this coupled with finding yourself affected by the PALB2 mutation is bound to be a worry for you :-/ Although a CBC with differentials is a comprehensive test unless any of the marker(s) count figures are a lot higher than normal this on it's own doesn't really count for much in a diagnostic way. They can fluctuate and several other factors can raise these slightly. Markers in 'bloods' are mostly used for monitoring how well a particular treatment is working on a cancer to indicate if a dosage needs raising or a different treatment regime is required. I don't know enough about PALB2 to know if there is a specific marker they look for, but the 3 common breast cancer markers are tests for CEA, CA 15-3, and CA 27.29    These as mentioned above are mostly used for monitoring and not a 'given' for a diagnosis.

      "Content": "Hi Carol, It is normal to have a DEXA bone density scan prior to starting any of the AI (aromatase Inhibitor) tablets Letrozole, Anastrozole or Exemestane as these can cause bone thinning leading to osteopaenia over a long period.  These AI's are usually offered towards the end of treatment, I think because you have been placed on these to shrink things down early on into your diagnosis it has thrown them off track somewhere along the line. Jackie's oncologist referred her to her GP to get the DEXA scan carried out - So this is something an Oncologist would arrange as standard but the surgeon may not have even realised this needed to be arranged ? I would phone your GP and explain that you have been placed on Letrozole and need to have a DEXA bone density scan - and see what they say. Your GP may need to speak with your surgeon to confirm this but you deffo should have one as you may well be on these tablets for 5 years and need a baseline figure to compare against bone density figures again later on. It may be another couple of weeks before you can have the scan but your bone density won't have been affected too much in that time frame.  J had her 2nd dexa scan after being on Letrozole for 6 months. There is more info about DEXA scans here - They only take around 40 minutes. Hope this has helped a bit, take care, G n' J",

All the little niggles that come with it too like, hair loss, feeling everything is out of your control, being so damn tired and achy, nauseous etc all take their toll. You just have to drag yourself up and do stuff on the good days (luckily there are more good than bad) just don't overdo it and hit 'the wall' the next day. What you are feeling is totally normal.... For the tough days there are duvets on sofa's and DVD's :-) On the first page of Aug / Sept chemo clubs there is a link to chemo aids that have been gathered over the months from members here which can help you through some of the side effects.

If you are one of those who are put on Tamoxifen for a couple of years then switched to one of the others mentioned above, then is the time you will def need one. If you do start getting joint aches with Tamoxifen you could ask your onco team about getting a dexa scan done, or you can get referred by your GP to have one but while you are on Tamox they might say it is not needed :-/ G n' J",

If they had been cancerous they would have done a 'clearance' while she was still in theatre but luckily hers were free of cells. Not all hospitals can carry out these checks while the patient is still 'under' so can be called back a week or so later to have the rest removed if needed. From what we have read on here, quite a few have to go back for node clearance. Have you had a HER2 result yet - or will you have to wait for that test from histology post surgery ?

Know it is everyone's personal choice but did you ask about your chances of recurrence with or without the use of chemotherapy ? If you have an appointment due soon ask them to put your pathology results into something like the 'Predict Tool' (link) so you get a better understanding of the % chances of recurrence with or without chemotherapy being used. Don't know if you qualify for the 'Chemo or no Chemo' Oncotype-DX test without knowing your grade and other details from pathology results, if you have them is there any chance you could type them into a reply, if they didn't give you a copy. Do please ask them for a copy for your own future reference - you need to know your full diagnosis to make informed decisions about further treatments without putting yourself at risk later in life.

It looks very much like you would qualify for the Oncotype-DX test too if you are ER+ positive and grade 2 with no lymph node involvement. As long as you are HER2- negative as well, you tick all the boxes for the Oncotype test which is the better one of the two. Predict is just that a prediction but the Oncotype test actually tests your own tissue (they use some from the surgery) but the results can take a month to six weeks to come through with that test. Everyone would love to dodge chemo, it can be damn tough some days and of course the hair loss is a bonus (not) However the hair comes back and chemo can help you make it through to enjoy being a grandparent in the future too :) If you manage to get a test of some sort done and the figures show you would only benefit having chemo by a couple of percent over 10 years or so it makes saying 'no thanks' easier but if it comes back higher you might want to try all the meds you can to avoid all this happening again sometime ? Not trying to worry you in the slightest but I would like to think at least you had been given all the information you needed by your team to make this decision one way or the other. G n' J",

They are basically the same but Taxol is given in lower doses weekly and Docetaxel is given every 3 weeks. So if yours is going to be 3 weekly it will be the Docetaxel. Hope this helps, if you need more info just holler there are info pages on Macmillan covering ALL the chemo drugs if you want to have a read ? G n' J",

The more common symptoms are gradual weakening of the heart muscles which can cause lower pressure of blood ejection between heart chambers - This is why you have regular Muga Scans runny nose and slight cold symptoms. There is some info on Cancer Research UK about Herceptin here and also the PIL patient information leaflet from Roche here. Do you know if you are having Herceptin via sub-cut injection or the bag, pump and cannula method ? Please don't read too much into the huge list of side effects although some do have reactions to herceptin - Jackie had 18 x Herceptin and apart from the 24 hour headache and a runny sometimes minor nose bleeds all was well.

In laboratory studies, graviola extracts can kill some types of liver and breast cancer cells that are resistant to particular chemotherapy drugs. But there haven\u2019t been any studies in humans. So we don't know whether it can work as a cancer treatment or not.  Many sites on the internet advertise and promote graviola capsules as a cancer cure but none of them are supported by any reputable scientific cancer organisations. We do not support the use of graviola to treat cancer. Our advice is to be very cautious about believing information or paying for any type of alternative cancer therapy on the internet\" Further Soursop info at Sloan Kettering. G n' J",

Like if they would remove any extra nodes if needed at the same time, or would it def mean a separate operation ? What types of chemo regime drugs are they going to give you ? How long would you have to wait for results about margins and ask about your HER2 status, if you are HER2 + you may be given Herceptin as you can be on this for a year. It is possible to be negative for ER and PR but still HER2+ You seem to have a great attitude to all this even if you are concerned about it all. Lets face it, who isn't at the start :-(    One step at a time is def the way to go, once they start the treatment roller coaster ride your life seems to revolve around hospital appts and you don't get much time to think or worry about it Big 'High Five' for the weight loss,  recon later could be a way of making use of some excess skin and free you of it without having to go private - Suppose that could be seen as a bonus :-/  Know you say about that would be at least 10 months or a year away but that time soon goes.

A few ground rules about chemo in general and switching to T.... Reactions are very, very rare, thanks mostly to the steroids given. People only post messages when they have a problem leading to a very biased negative opinion. You get everyone's snapshot of all the side effects but individually most only get a couple to deal with. Don't keep secrets, if you do get an issue tell your onco, and ask about it here - most can be easily helped with meds. Most doses are the maximum you can handle, if it seems too much it can be reduced by 20% and still be as effective. Look in the mirror and see the beautiful feisty woman doing all she can to get through this and not a cancer victim. Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Chiara,  Welcome to the club no one really wants to be in. Have the utmost respect for you asking here so you can help your mum. Good news is that the ductal part means it's probably DCIS = ductal carcinoma in situ - the in situ part means in one place, so it has been found early and hasn't spread - maybe a few cancer cells will be found in any lymph nodes they remove for checking (known as a SNB Sentinel node biopsy which is standard practice. This is usually done when they perform either a lumpectomy or mastectomy but can be carried out as a separate op to aid diagnosis. Jackie my wife was also grade 3 DCIS (dcis is always stage zero which is good) but for her being classed as ER and HER2 positive still meant Mastectomy, 6 x chemo sessions and radiotherapy so although this sounds grim most of the treatment is to stop any re-occurance later on. Once any surgery is completed the tumour will be gone. Your mum won't get a full diagnosis until they have got results from any tissue samples post surgery. Please understand because it has been found early and contained the treatment is still fairly full on, so she may need, surgery, chemo and radiotherapy. Realise this may sound very scary at the moment - it is tough but do'able as most here will tell you. Here is a link to the booklet 'Understanding Ductal Carcinoma In Situ' which may help you get your head around what it's all about. Hopefully you can get mum involved here too later when she or you needs more specific info about any treatment regime they put in place. Hope this helps for now, no doubt you have a head full of questions, so fire away.... We're all here to help. Take care,George & Jackie.",

Very few have problems with them (although it can happen) they are well worth the low risk and inconvenience.  It saves you from becoming one of those unfortunate ladies who suffer ongoing vein problems post chemo because of chemo leakage and/or damage which can be an issue with Paclitaxel.

Katie, don't know if you came across this BCC booklet during your research but it's a good read so I'll stick the link in anyway 'Reducing The Risk of Lymphoedema' don't get too fretful about this only a few people get full blown long term LD after lymph surgery most will have a little fluid build up but some of this will be seroma (fluid from the surgical cutting) rather than lymph fluid. A lot of people confuse the two. Seroma is short term fluid build up which eases as the scalpel cuts heal and is mostly why the drains are put in. Lymph fluid build up can last longer, and if severe and painful can have to be aspirated out a few times before it settles down. Problem is with LD it can come on anytime (even after a year later) after surgery especially if you have had a full clearance so you have to be aware of injuring to that side.

Just popped your head up over the wall to take a browse around perhaps ? If you look at the top of the window under where the group name is you will see a square green button- If you click the green one named 'Join This Group'  your window will refresh and you will notice the green button is now black and says 'Joined' You will also see a new button appear named \" New Discussion\"    Click on this, give your post a title and send us all an intro message and ask whatever questions you like, you'll soon get plenty of replies. This will also give you a lot more information and options on your profile page and you can also then use the site fully and create and add friends as you settle in who you can personally message later on these do not appear on the website so is good for exchanging personal info like email addresses etc. If you see an interesting post and wish to get more info from the poster, just click their 'green text' name and it will open up their profile page and you can find their other posts clicking their 'Activity' button and read their status. Most items in posts with green text are clickable links. Three weeks for radiotherapy is the norm, just take it one step at a time - if you have any questions or concerns about your lumpectomy, just join and holler. They are a great bunch here who all go the extra mile to help with friendly advice and support. Hope this helps, George & Jackie",

The main type of scanners used looking for cancer spread are MRI or Nuclear Bone Scans - You will more than likely be offered some form of chemo regime because of the affected lymph nodes you had. Which is fairly standard practice for what they call lymphovascular invasion. Although post surgery means the cancer has been removed the aim of the chemo and other follow on treatments like Rads etc are to vastly reduce the risk of recurrence in the future.

If you have lower levels of oestrogen you are probably not producing so much serotonin the feel good hormone either which can make you feel a bit down. It may be a case of allowing a bit longer for your body to adjust to the new hormone levels. If it continues to be a problem and you don't want to take anti depressants the only other option may be to see if your onco can give you an alternative tablet. Only problem with that is it may well have the same effect and you end up with other side effects too :-( Hope you find your smile soon, G n' J",

I don't like the brave wording connection either I asked J for her views and she wouldn't want anyone to shave their heads as a fundraiser for the same reasons most have given here. She did make one valid comment though, it is easy to open your purse or wallet to hand over some cash (takes all of a few seconds) but if they shave their heads it is something that reminds them for a good couple of months they made a sort of sacrifice for a worthy charity. We as a few others have suggested donate in other ways like the many hours we spend volunteering or donating at Macmillan Coffee Mornings, bake sales, chucking wet sponges  - Oh! and the fella a few years ago that pushed a sprout up to the top of Snowdon with his nose... Yes, you read that right :) You can read about that here. Farmer near us last year baled all their hay in pink plastic and got people to adopt and write messages on them and donated the money to Cancer Research UK Now if we could come up with something original that Macmillan could 'own' like that Ice Bucket Challenge to replace it - that would be brill.... Assuming this thread is being watched by the black suits (or would they be green) ? how about suggesting a nationwide alternative :) Hugs, G n' J If you want to go through a more appropriate channel, I\u2019d encourage you to fill in our complaints form to make your complaints official.

It may help the folliculitis to clear more quickly and reduce the risk of it becoming worse. You can use one of the Dermol emollients as a soap substitute until the area has cleared also Oilatum Plus bath additive. For localised areas of in grown hair, an antibiotic cream like Fucidin may be easier to use. Have also read on here that aloe vera can help sooth sore skin - if the hairs have formed 'heads' you could pierce these and tease the hair out, as these boil type bumps can get quite large if the hair coils up under the skin and is not treated, do be careful of infections though.

You are right about the meds as treatments like Herceptin and the 5-10 years of hormone inhibitor tablets are used for those who are + positive.  The standard treatments for TNBC are Chemo, surgery and radiotherapy. If chemo is given before surgery this is called neoadjuvant, surgery then chemo is called adjuvant. Sometimes patients only find out they are TN from the pathology test results after surgery. There is a Triple Negative Breast Group you could also join but it isn't as active as this group and most of the TN ladies are in this group too. If you are curious about Triple Negative BC you can find out more clicking the link. Regarding your needle phobia; was anything mentioned to you about having a PICC iv line or Port fitted for your chemo and blood tests etc ? If these daily injections are during the middle week, they sound more like a type of G-CSF injection to help build up your white blood cell count ? G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi  Deidre,  This seems like a step up from just tingling or pins and needles. Sounds like you may have a touch of what they call peripheral neuropathy which is basically a bit of nerve damage. Yet another side effect of chemo which mostly affects toes and fingers. Sometimes it goes the other way and everything feels warm or hot. Definitely phone your onco dr or nurse tomorrow morning as they may want to see you and check it out. Don't get alarmed, it's just that neuropathy is something they advise you inform them of asap. The after effects of chemo can take a good month or two to recover from after treatment. How far into your treatment are you, sounds like you have not long started ?  George & Jackie.",

      "Content": "Hi  Gerty,  Nice to hear your onco Dr put your mind at ease, headgames are a bugger. Chemo, the gift that keeps giving eh.  Just over 4 weeks and you'll be able to kiss that part of your treatment goodbye and concentrate on recovering for your wedding. Runny nose is part of the game too, partly as you say to having no nasal hairs now, better get used to it though, as even when they grow back the Herceptin will give you slight cold symptoms runny nose, bit of achey joints etc but nowhere near as much as the chemo so for anyone about to get on Herceptin, don't fear it, it's a pussycat by comparison. Jackie is halfway through her 18 x Herceptin and the few side effects do ease off after a while. For anyone starting out - It's so hard trying not to worry about every twinge, side effect, or the way your life gets taken over, everything is new and scary it's a trip into the unknown, the only thing for sure is no amount of worry will change anything it just gnaws away making you feel ten times worse so you sort of have to have a \"what will be, will be\"  attitude and fight it all the way. You find inner strength you never knew you had. Take care Deirdre - The end of your tunnel is in sight  :-)   George & Jackie.",

      "Content": "Hi Poppy  / Poppy58  Nice early morning reply, but then 30 years of shift work will do that to you :) There are two tests for HER2 which are IHC and FISH They carry out the IHC test first and this is marked out of 3 This is usually written up as   HER2- +  or  HER2+++  the plus sign being the score (1 or 3) 1 is HER2- negative  3 is HER2+ positive, but if the results come back at ++2 (inconclusive) they use the other FISH test which is either neg or pos with no middle ground to confirm it one way or the other.  If you had been HER2+ they would be offering you a year of Herceptin and possibly Perjeta on top of chemo, so you'll get away with that part at least. The CT scan is standard if they are going to be offering you chemo, they use it to check for any unknown surprises to the health of your other organs: Liver, Kidneys Heart etc - in case they need to use an alternative chemo regime to compensate for an issue. I'm assuming by 'and then drug treatment' you mean tablets for being ER+ positive ?  Any other Q's, just holler, there is always someone around :) Hope you are recovering well from surgery and keeping up with those pesky exercises...

It\u2019s most common in people who are slim and have saline implants. It\u2019s usually less obvious when wearing a bra. If it becomes very noticeable the implant may need to be replaced. Were you originally diagnosed with IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) or another type ? Another question - has this orange peel appearance only come on during radiotherapy or has it appeared since surgery but before rads ? One side effect of rads is the build up of lymphatic fluid under the skin which can cause dimpling and / or this orange peel look. Think personally I would ring your breast nurse (BCN) to get this 'orange peel' checked out now to see what they suggest, if it is a rads side effect It should go down slowly within a few weeks of finishing rads but do get it looked at before then.

Indicator of radiologists opinion of the absence or likelihood of breast cancer. On a scale of 1 to 6 (1 being negative 2 definitely benign 3 probably benign (6 month follow up) 4 reasonable chance of being malignant biopsy recommended 5 High probability of being malignant take action 6 Known to be malignant after biopsy confirmation.

You can just buy them online but seeing as you'll be in flight for a long haul you want to get it right. There are printed sleeves available now if you don't like the look of the skin tone ones. There is a Macmillan info page on Lymphoedema Control just click the link to read about sleeves. Don't get confused between Lymphoedema and Seroma though, they are different. Seroma is usually fluid build up from breast surgery and the latter from lymph damage or removal. Have you had many lymph nodes removed ? Hope this helps, G n' J",

They usually do to give them base bone density figures to check to see if your osteopeania is getting worse the longer you stay on the Letrozole. As you had osteo problems before you would have thought this was a no brainer  :-(  I would definitely take this up with your gp don't suffer in silence it won't get any better if you keep it to yourself.  I'm not medically trained but there are two types of bone scan that I know of. The 15 minute Dexa scan and the much more informative bone scan performed by the nuclear medicine radiology dept which can take up to 4 hours where you are injected with an isotope wait a few hours while it gets into your bones and they use a gamma camera (similar type of thing as a Muga scan) if you ever had those for Hercepin treatment. If you have already had dexa scans maybe it's time to go for the bigger picture at the nuclear radiology dept ? Cancer research has an info page on this here http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/tests/bone-scan So, yes by all means get yourself a scan. Jackie was given a borderline osteopeanic diagnosis after her second Dexa scan after being on Letrozole for 6 months and is taking Adcal (calcium tablets) Sunvit tablets and takes one Alendrolic acid tablet a week to help with this.  You can search the Maccy site just type in Dexa  There are bound to be some posts as we recall having mentioned it before in replies to others suffering with this. Take care Stoksie and let us know how you get on. George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Hiya Yvonne,  You sound a bit more chilled out, that's great......  Don't worry about the radiotherapy yet it's the daily travelling more than anything which is tiring although the radiotherapy is progressively tiring in itself it just combines to make you feel a bit whacked out. More'so at the end - do you know how many sessions you will have ? As for the operation if it's a lumpectomy also known as WLE (wide local excision) depending on how much tissue they take you may have drains in for any fluid to escape from sometimes they will send you home with one still in place for a week or so before it is removed. This is to help avoid any seroma (fluid build up) under the skin which can be a bit sore when you are healing. After that the tissue removed will be looked at to check if they got it all and adjust any grade or stage results. They use this info to fine tune your treatment. Are they taking any lymph nodes as a sample - 'sentinel node biopsy' with dye (SNB) at the same time during the op ? if so they will check these too - so you'll probably have a little wait to get the results from that. Best wishes Yvonne, it'll be nowhere near as bad as your imagination is telling you. You'll be fine, George & Jackie",

If it gets really uncomfortable and getting you down it can be syringed out but in some cases it just makes space for more fluid to be produced. It can take quite a long time to be re-absorbed reducing the pressure you think it will never go away. I would contact either your breast nurse, consultant or GP inform them of your problems and see what they can do to help with pain relief apart from aspirating it don't think there is much they can do about the fluid build up. Be honest with them don't pussyfoot about if it's agony tell them how bad it is. You know what medical folk are like if they tell you something is going to be uncomfortable it means it's gonna hurt like hell. You have to spell it out in black and white or they just don't get it. A lot here have mentioned previously they find some comfort from using those V shaped pillows. Maybe some replies from anyone who have also suffered seroma after reconstruction can advise ? Hope you get some relief soon, it sounds awful. Take care, George & Jackie",

There can be a weeks delay at times if your blood count or liver enzymes are low you will be given a week for them to recover - it isn't written in stone so don't plan anything specific too far in advance. Take it week by week. The E part of FEC will make your pee pink for 24 hours or so afterwards, so don't go thinking this is blood. You will also be given anti-nausea tablets and probably steroids to help with any reactions to have on the day and bring home - Do take these even if you feel you don't need them, as it's easier to keep on top of any issues rather than actually being sick then trying to keep the tablets down.

      "Content": "Hi Caroline, So after the agonising waiting initial results stage, you are now finding once your treatment starts your feet won't touch the ground for a while now. The extra tissue taken on your WLE is what they call 'a clear margin' and is supposed to be a margin of cancer cell free tissue around the lump unfortunately sometimes after it's been examined in pathology they find it doesn't have clear margins they have you in to take another nibble. The reason they have taken you off HRT is because if it turns out your tumour is ER or PR positive (oestrogen and progesterone and quite a few are) this means the hormones in your tablets would be feeding the cancer cells. You won't get this info until about a week after your WLE and the results come back from histology. Which is also when you will get any stage / grade and HER2 - or + diagnosis. These are the results they tailor your further treatment regime to. You would be surprised at the number of ladies here who have been diagnosed with cancer after being on HRT - nothing proved but seems too much of a coincidence ? :-( We were a bit more fortunate that you re IVF our daughter was born in 1989 after three attempts and a miscarriage. No NHS funding or 'free' goes at all for it way back then seemed like were both just working to live and pay for ivf treatment. Still It was only money :-/ we got lucky and that is the main thing.

Know if you get left with some residual PN you can get stuck with it on a more permanent basis but not heard of it getting worse this far down the line.  There is a thing called Motor Neuropathy which is a type of PN that affects muscles and movements. Is this something you have had for a while since chemo or quite recently started ? I would get yourself to you GP, explain in full the range of all your 'tics' and get some bloods and/or other tests done to see if they can point to a cause. Twitching and involuntary movements happen to everyone at times but it's usually a 'one off' and doesn't happen that often - if this is getting more common it needs looking into as it could be a symptom of lots of other conditions from a particular vitamin deficiency to tourette's tics, diabetes, parkinson's etc Good luck in getting through the GP's firewall receptionist for a quick appointment.

Surprising how quickly they evaporate when you are dipping into them on a weekly basis and with winter heating bills and Christmas on the horizon they can be an account zapper. Nice to hear your husbands new employers were so sympathetic ( bloody shi*s ) but it's an employers market and with so'ooo many applying for every vacancy they can afford to be very picky as to who gets the post. I dropped down to part time when Jackie was off work for 9 months and although she got SSP for 28 weeks it was still a juggling act but we made it through unscathed. In fact it was a great eye opener for both of us as we found we were wasting a fair chunk of our earnings. We both stopped smoking, cancelled some monthly subscriptions  and  non essential outgoings and since then we now both only work part time and we have so much free time for ourselves now to enjoy the simple things like afternoon walks with the dog, pub lunches etc. Sure beats the hell out of the 40+ hours a week work merry go round. Can you and your husband \"wing it\" to get jobseekers allowance by saying you ARE actively looking for work but at the present time it would have to be part time employment ( after all it doesn't state it has to be full time work ) surely actively looking for work means any work ? Don't be fobbed off by the benefits system you have to be on the ball or they'll try to do you out of every penny you may be entitled to unless you get someone sympathetic the other side of the desk. A lot of people do not realise that if you have, or have had a diagnosis of cancer you are covered by the DDA disability act, now named the Equality Act so that label so that can open a few doors you may have to be persistent to get anywhere though.  Do phone the maccy financial folks, they helped us out and guided us through the benefits minefield when we needed it, they know all the in's and out's of finding out what you are entitled to  Hugs and Best Wishes,  George & Jackie.",

Meat or seafood that may not be cooked all the way through and warm, cooked rice that could be left long enough for bugs to form in it. If you are happy with your local take away and have no worries about the quality of their dishes, great but to be sure the best options are the Chinese or Indian ready meals from supermarkets because they have to be cooked and packaged to the same very high safe and consistent food standards as frozen ready meals.

There are a few winter bugs going around so keeping an eye on your temps is a good thing. If it is a dry cough it could be a side effect of the Cyclophosphamide part of FEC as this can affect your lung tissue a bit. Lung tissue can get thicker and less flexible making it harder for you to breathe. If this cough doesn't clear up over the next day or so (or develop into a cold) or If you find that you start getting breathless when you do any exercise, walking uphill or going upstairs let your onco team know about it so they can check you out - If it is Cyclophosphamide causing this they may change it to something else. Hopefully it will only be a 24 hour thing. Maybe others ladies here have had similar issues with FEC, luckily Jackie got away without any coughing issues from it. G n' J",

G n' J If your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas to avoid contact with people who have not had it, especially people who are at risk of serious problems, such as newborn babies, pregnant women and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets)............................ There are many types of white blood cells which make up the total white cell count. Their main function is to help your body to fight infection. If your white cell count is low (usually 7 to 14 days after the chemotherapy) you may become prone to infections and take longer to recover from them. In general, these arise from bacteria within our own bodies, and it is not necessary to avoid crowded places or isolate yourself from others. However, we advise you to keep away from people with serious infections, such as chicken pox................................ Stay away from people who you know have an infection such as a cold, the flu, measles or chicken pox. If you haven\u2019t had chicken pox yourself and you come into contact with someone with chickenpox or shingles, please contact the unit for advice.................. Varicella zoster is the same virus that causes chicken pox. It can cause very serious and sometimes fatal infections, such as pneumonia, in people with cancer. The virus also causes a painful condition called shingles. You can only get shingles if you have had chicken pox in the past. This is because after you've had chicken pox the virus does not fully go away. It lies inactive in the body, but can become active again if the immune system is weak. This is why people can get shingles after chemotherapy treatment............ Keep away from people who have chicken pox or shingles if you have never had these illnesses. They could make you very ill. If you do come into contact with someone who has them tell your doctor or nurse straight away............................",

The individual chemo drugs mentioned on the info pages are clickable. There is also a booklet titled 'Coping With Hair Loss' which explains a little about the 'cold cap' Most here would agree that once chemo starts the importance of hair loss slips down the league table of concerns but if you are wanting to keep you hair the cold cap may help. Everyone is different and what works for some doesn't always work for someone else. There may be a few here who have had CMF but it is not a commonly used combination. Hope this helps, George & Jackie",

There is a line between Complimentary therapy and Alternative therapy. We're hoping you meant the former. Sometimes the words are used together but they mean totally different things. Complimentary is fine but NONE of the alternative therapies have been tested and proven as effective. Please don't think you can beat this with just alternative treatments too many have tried before you and lost the battle. Those few who have survived probably would have survived anyway. There is a lot of information about complimentary and alternative at cancer reseach uk (cruk) Just be aware of dubious claims - 'There are a lot more people making a living from cancer than there are dying from it' G n' J",

Maybe worth your while sending her a friend request to see if she is up for a chat seeing as you both are 2% er's with Tubular. There may be others here with tubular but I can't recall seeing any recently.  If you click the green text link it will take you to her profile page where there is a 'Add as a Friend' button she hasn't posted for a few weeks but that may be because of surgery etc. Macmillan will send her a friend request email and if she accepts she will probably respond to your post or contact you by personal message. Did you check out the links I put into our reply to marielouise?  Macmillan has an info page on Tubular Cancer don't know if it contains any new info for you. Assume they were keeping an eye on you after your previous ADH ? as adh means you they put you in the 'at risk' group.  To true it will be a long week, the waiting results time is terrible. Fingers crossed there are no more nasty surprises for you, do keep posting with any questions you may need an answer to or for any advice. Tubular may be rare but the treatments are mostly the same as we all have to go through. One little bit of advice - See although you posted a reply to the group, you haven't actually \"joined\" it yet At the top of the breast group page just under the title name there is a green square button named \"join this group\" if you click that you will actually become a member and a new button will appear named \"New Discussion\" You use that to start a new topic so the discussions don't get all muddled up and it gets you more specific replies :-) Take care, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Hi Year 4 teacher  Depending on what pathology results you get from the breast or node tissue you may not need chemo. The affected node you had may have only had a few cells within it, not a cluster or tumour and as the other node was clear feels it is better left rather than having more removed and finding those also clear. Until then and depending on what results you get if you are ER+ oestrogen positive but HER2- negative some tissue may be sent off for the Oncotype-DX test to get a score out of 100 to find out if chemo would be of any substantial long term benefit. If you are found to be HER2+ positive you will definitely be getting chemo and Herceptin. If you do have chemotherapy recommended the sessions usually take 18 weeks in total (6 x 3 weekly) but you can usually add two weeks to this if your chemo gets delayed for a week a couple of times.  Radiotherapy is mostly started around 4 - 6 weeks post chemo so you are talking about a ball park figure of 5 possibly 6 months. Either way the radiotherapy or chemo will given to eliminate any risk however small to your nodes as best as possible. Most here will tell you it is harder to recover from a node clearance than a mastectomy or WLE (lumpectomy) and remember if you are ER/PR+ positive you will also be placed on hormone inhibitor tablets for 5 possibly 10 years as another back up treatment. Good luck with your margins Friday, take care, G n' J",

The Milk Thistle info page is here and the main alphabetical herbal index page is this one. Which is great because you can flick through all the ingredients in a product. G n' J",

That is a sign that it is starting to get ready to come out, if you think finding hair everywhere will cause you distress or hassle you can get it cut really short but a few people don't lose all their hair so it's up to you where you go from here.

Some massage therapy can be helpful as a complimentary treatment but some types are not advised like deep massage and I'm unsure if ultrasonic massage is classed under this term ?

It is common for it to be really slow to start with but after a month to six weeks it should be growing around half an inch per month. This rate can be slower if you are taking any hormone tablets though and also whether you had FEC then T or the other way around can have a bearing on this ? For some reason it seems to grow back quicker if you were FEC then T. How long, or should that be short is your hair at the moment ? G n' J",

It's not so much depression but the effects are very similar, and no doubt all the guilt you are piling onto yourself about being a burden won't be helping to get your head back in a good place. In the old days after surgery you had a period called \"convalescence\" a word not used much now, but is as important now as it was back then.  A time to heal both the body and mind after a trauma or surgery something too easily ignored in this fast paced modern life of ours. So stop impersonating the Duracell bunny and take some time out for yourself - \"you are worth it\"..... as they say. Loads'a hugs and a Fluffy Drum Roll , G n' J",

So don't expect too much too soon it does work well but can take a while. I have tagged her name so Heather should get a notification of this message and will hopefully reply at some time. Have you been told how long you may need to be taking them for or is it a case of wait and watch ? If you have any questions or find you need some support just send a message.

It's great she is up for helping her mum, unfortunately I didn't realise who her mum was until she mentioned your name and her age. I noticed her  membership still seems to be useable and I sent her a link so she could get 'chatting' on the Rip-Rap website forum. I don't know if you mentioned to her she is under age so I don't know if she has seen that message so I'll copy that in here so you can pass it on if she missed it or let her read the original message (either or)  :) Copied text -  Davina, You can post an introductory message to rip rap from this link  www.riprap.org.uk/.../new-topic.asp     You just have to select a member name (not your own) and follow the instructions. There is one message there from someone whose mum has breast cancer too. Bless her, she was probably too scared and angsty while you were going through treatment - In her eyes she could have even had thoughts of losing you and that must have been a terribly emotional time for her as well as you. Is Davina your oldest by any chance ? Now she can see you have been through the survival course those worries have left her and she wants to be there for you. Sorry to read the booster was a step too far and you got rad burns don't know how long ago you finished your sessions but the worst should be over 2-3 weeks afterwards, so hang on in there and count the days off. You are so right, cancer does change you as a person - for the better mostly. Teaches to enjoy the simple pleasures you used to take for granted, who your friends really are, not giving a shi* about other peoples 'petty' problems, being more assertive and no longer take the crap you used to :) Can't believe you have just about finished ? Looking back it doesn't seem that long ago we spotted Karen the rabbit in the headlights joining us here  LOL Don't be a stranger we love to read how you are getting on and you are now fully qualified to help out the 'newbies'  :) Loads'a Christmas Hugs Karen (and Davina)  G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi QuiltyRosie, Thickening is a known side effect of Tamoxifen but it doesn't affect everyone and in those it does affect it can thicken more quickly for some than it does for others. The results from the TVU may not be detailed enough to make an accurate diagnosis, if so you may also be referred for an MRI or CT scan to double check everything. As you have only been on them for just over 18 months it is likely to get worse if you have to take these for another 3 years plus so even if the results hopefully come though clear they may offer you a hysterectomy anyway.  Whether they would do this and keep you on Tamoxifen or possibly change you onto one of the Aromatse Inhibitors type tablets is something you could ask when you get your results. You could join and post this question to the Womb Group NOT saying this because it could be that, it's just that the ladies there can give you more experienced advice about TVU results and follow ups, lining thickening (how thick 12mm is by comparison) and any other symptoms like bleeding etc. Hope this is of some help, there may be other members of the breast group who have had similar problems with Tamoxifen and thickening and what that involved.

      "Content": "Hi Rhonda, The amount you are getting does seem too be way more than most, unfortunately halting oestrogen production either surgically or with Zoladex / Gosrelin to get off Tamoxifen is only part of the problem. This is called Ovarian Ablation (link) under Information and support ? Although pre menopause your ovaries produce most of the oestrogen it is also produced by your adrenal glands and body fat cells so you will still be producing some oestrogen which will still need tablets to control. There are some who have Zoladex and are switched to an aromatase inhibitor like Letrozole ot Anastrozole which may help with easing all these hot flashes but these AI's in turn may also cause joint / bone aches so you just end up swapping one lot of side effects for others :( Just putting a few options out there for you to consider and ask your onco about until you get more replies to help you gather enough info for a decision.

Is your husband on any other medication besides Tamoxifen ? as in males around 20% of the oestrogen is produced by the testicles and there are other drugs out there that control this better ? If you click this link it takes you to the Hormonal Therapies Treatment for Breast Cancer  in Men information page where you can read about oestrogen production in men. There is also this page about Possible Hormonal Treatment Side Effects in Men (link) Depression post treatment is also fairly common, it's like a type of post traumatic stress disorder and there may well be other problems he is coping with like male breast cancer and surgery for it is quite rare and he may feel really strange in himself about this, also drug treatments may have affected the way he now feels about himself ?

      "Content": "Hiya Pmcd, No reason why you couldn't start the ball rolling now if after a bit of thought you would like to go for it. A couple of ladies here had their recon over 2 years later. In a lot of cases they actually prefer you to get rads out of the way before doing reconstructions as the rads can affect the tissue by causing some tightness and possibly a little shrinkage. There's this Macmillan booklet 'Understanding Breast Reconstruction' (link) you can read and also download for future reference. There is quite a range of different types, some where they use back or tummy tissue you may not be suitable for if you are a bit on the slim side. Be aware it does contain post surgery images but it wouldn't be very informative without them :) There is also a Mac info page here which  may have different topics about it. If you are a larger lady they may require you to lose a little weight first it depends on the surgeon and annethetist. There may be several reason why some don't get a recon. Could be they can't face further surgery, were small breasted before and are happy with their look - being uneven can be a pain if you are left with one big boob but they can also reduce the size of number 2 to match the recon breast, as they only usually recon up to a C cup ? as the weight 'pulls' on the stitches and can cause other problems. I'll butt out now and let others bombard you too  LOL Good luck gathering all the info and making the right decision for you.  G n' J",

It is tough when a loved one is too frail to get the more affective treatments like surgery or chemo but targetted radiotherapy is a good option in these cases. Do you think her breathlessness could be tied in with anything else going on like COPD, pleural fluid issue or sarcoidosis as well as having some chest node involvement ?  Unless the swollen nodes are pressing on her trachea you would think any enlarged nodes would have to be fairly large to put enough pressure on her lungs/diaphragm to cause breathlessness. Is your mum just 'top' breathing (not using bottom half of lungs) or having problems breathing alltogether ? You could ask her oncologist to go through all their findings with you to get the full picture and what her radiotherapy course would entail; maybe ask if you can record it on your phone so you don't miss anything mentioned ? Find with a lot of these professionals unless you ask specific questions they tend to not tell you everything :( Most cancer cells are spread through lympho vascular invasion. If in the lymph system they can be 'caught' by the nodes which stops them reaching other organs, if vascular they can find their way to the liver, lungs, bone or brain - Chemotherapy as a whole body treatment would normally be on the table if this is the case but it is too tough a regime for those who are frail :( Hope you find some answers and your mum has a successful outcome from the rads.

By the time you realise you have a problem you are too far into your sessions to do anything about it :-( Yes, by all means varnish is fine Just make sure you get some Acetone free varnish remover from Boots, or any other high street chemist as the solvent used is a lot less harsh. Don't be tempted to use stick on nails as the adhesive can get into any places where your own nail may have lifted and become a site for infection and they may actually take your own nail with it if you try to remove them. You may end up losing some nails anyway, but you will have almost fully formed but thinner new nails underneath. Hopefully you will get some more replies about nail varnish types and care - as Jackie lost all 20 of hers because we knew nothing about this nail problem at the time. Found this on the Australian Breast Cancer Network About Nails and Chemo  it's a good read but a bit too late. May be of use to others reading this and about to start chemo though.

Was the seat belt over your operation side as well ? Right hand side surgery will cause seat belt pressure problems and left side surgery will stretch everything with gear changes handbrake etc. That and having both hands on the steering wheel for at least an hour will stretch the tendons in your armpits. I would see if it eases over the weekend but if this is really painful get it looked at and some some better pain relief until it lessens. As long as it doesn't feel hot and/or look inflamed (sign of infection) a bit of rest should help. If you were a right handed breast girl you could get one of those small shaped cushions to slip between your seatbelt and chest to take the pressure off. G n' J",

Jackie has just got her 3 year review scan letter and it does bring back all the emotions of when first diagnosed, so how you are feeling is totally normal. Several types of lump which will show up on an ultrasound are benign fatty tumours, calcification, fibroids and others non cancerous conditions. Chances are you could rule a cyst out as these are mostly fluid filled and would probably have be noticed during the biopsy. You would be very unlucky to get another primary so do hope for the best, rather than fearing the worst.

      "Content": "Hiya, It is nearly always the lack of oestrogen caused by either the menopause itself and/or the hormone inhibitor tablets (whatever type they are) that are to blame. Oestrogen is also a 'feel good' hormone which is why you can also feel down or teary at times but oestrogen also controls other glands within the body so can throw the whole thing out of synch. During the menopause for most women this decrease is gradual, but many experts believe when estrogen falls, the hypothalamus is adversely affected. As the hypothalamus regulates your body temperature, the decrease in oestrogen causes the brain to detect too much body heat. As a natural reaction to this the brain releases hormones to help lower body heat, causing a patient\u2019s heart rate to rise and blood vessels to dilate in order to allow more blood to flow through and dissipate the heat. The increased blood flow causes the body to produce its natural cooling method- sweat. This series of events is what creates that heated, sweaty feeling that can be so inconvenient for sufferers. Having medication to halt oestrogen production stops this process being gradual and plunges you straight into low levels so you don't get chance to adapt to the changes over an extended period of time. You could ask about the hypothalamus aspect - if this is related there may be meds to counteract this effect but it is a complicated area ?",

      "Content": "Hi BeautyBeau15  Passing on the cold cap option and facing hair loss can be a bit traumatic and there are a few things you can consider. When hair loss starts the scalp can get quite sore - the too tight ponytail feeling can be a sign this is starting to occur ? Then is probably the best time to go for a shorter style like a pixie cut as it isn't so traumatic losing shorter hair. Deciding on when to take off the rest is more individual depending on appearence. If you leave this first cut too late for some the scalp can become so sore having it cut can be quite painful. The scalp pain is a lot less with shorter hair as there is less weight pulling on the follicles so you may not get this. Another option if you anyone has longish, undyed hair is to contact the Little Princess Trust and donate your hair to this worthwhile charity who make wigs for children with hairloss due to cancer treatments. Hope this is of some help, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi YorkA, Try not to be too downhearted about your lymph node results, it's lovely if you get to hear they are clear but chances are what they have found is just a few cells, not actual tumours. Obviously it does mean a bit extra surgery to remove them but they have to go to clear you of these stragglers. Lymph nodes are like your bodies fishing nets catching germs and infectious cells to trap them and mobilise your anti bodies to attack them. That is why your neck glands swell up with things like mumps and flu.  Nodes also stop cells from traveling elsewhere in the lymph system as the last thing you want is these cells floating around where they can settle in other areas like liver, lungs etc. Yes, it is hard especially at the start when everything is unknown and seems to take forever to get the answers you need regarding a full diagnosis and finding out what your treatment plan will entail. I was going to say happy new year but yours has started a bit c*ap, so we'll just say focus on something special to do in the summertime when you will feel more like you have reached your goals. Take care, G n' J",

Lets grab the postives and there are plenty so please try to stop all these 'don't want to leave them' worries. Grade 2 and ER+ so it's been found fairly early and being ER+ they will place you on long term tablets nearer the end of treatment for that.  J was grade 3 ductal in May 2012 (getting on for 4 years now) so this is do'able for around 90% of those diagnosed these days and the other 10% are those who are elderly, have other health problems or have been diagnosed really late with advanced BC. There are lots of members here who have finished treatment so can help you by answering any questions you may have (probably loads ?) Do ask away, were all here to help. Do you know as yet if you will be having surgery soon ? as when you are diagnosed things tend to happen quite quickly and that can make you feel a bit out of control.... Take care, G n' J",

Only half shifts to start with as it entails lots of corridor walking and climbing those dreaded stairways. Was great for her to meet up with her colleagues and tend patients again. She got chatting to a nurse who started there while she was off sick fighting the \"beast\" and to her surprise she mentioned  \"I know what you have been through, I had grade 3 BC SEVENTEEN years ago\"  She had right mx, sentinel nodes, chemo etc and has never looked back. Now, if that isn't inspiration that this bugger is so do-able, hide my underwear and call me Ben Dover. She came home to lasagne and lemon meringue - perfect way to end another hurdle being jumped. Nine months ago this point seemed so far away, it was a long tunnel and Jackie got derailed quite a few times on the way, but reached the end eventually. To anyone mid way, or just starting their on ride the Chemostar Express. Hang on tight and be aware of the bumpy bits and before you know it you are back in the sunlight, squinting, a bit wobbly, liking the new you that is emerging and feeling so much better.The glass that was half full, has been topped up. Now all she has to do is avoid getting shoved back in that queue for another ride in the future.

Now it's just under an inch and nearly long enough for a pixie cut. Came back same colour and still straight :-)  She never wanted to get a wig from the start either just bought a couple of wooly hats and some sparkly bits to smarten them up to wear when the chemo chills were worst. Gotta love the scrub hats idea, you can get some great random prints on those - Magic Roundabout would be apt  :-) It's been a hard 9 months for our daughter too, as she is 200 miles away at uni doing an adult nursing degree (BN) All she wanted was to be back home.  It was so hard trying to convince her all was well and she needs to stay put. Gotta mention the youtube video you replied to shuey about. If it's the same one we saw it sums chemo up perfectly. I found it easier to find if you add the word cancer to the wildest ride on earth search as it came up with loads otherwise. So true to life video about one ladies battle and recovery with a brilliant soundtrack. Certainly makes you feel an affinity with her. I may get a maccy slap for this, but here's the link anyway.... Is it the same one ?. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD9K3PqGE9k Cheers,  George n' Jackie",

      "Content": "Hi Lelly, So sorry to read about your twin. Of course you are more than welcome here, it's just about the busiest group here (there are loads of us) and we're all here to help each other through this. A lumpectomy is sometimes written here as WLE (wide local excision) so if you see that written anywhere it refers to the same op your sister is having. The surgeons tend to take the minimum they can without being too drastic in altering the breast shape, downside to that is one in five get recalled for a little more to be removed to obtain what they term as 'clear margins' to ensure all of it is removed. This information along with a fuller diagnosis is obtained from the removed tissue via the pathology lab about a week after surgery. So if it's info you need you can try this booklet first Breast Surgery and Recovery to give you some idea as to how your sis will be. You may also find this of help with the emotional side of all this When Someone Close To You Has Cancer - just click the green text links. You must have ahead full of questions, so if you need to know anything in particular, fire away. Take care, G n' J",

Apart from the 2 weeks to get to see your GP most here had the same time scale. 4 -6 weeks weeks of emotional agony, days seem to last forever until you find out the score :( You will find now they take brakes off and your feet hardly get chance to touch the ground Have you got a date for your surgery yet ?  It doesn't usually take long to fit you in for theatre and there will be another angsty 10 day waiting period after that while your tissue results from pathology come through. Don't fret too much about the surgery with lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy (WLE & SNB) most are home the next day if you are early morning on 'the list' may even be same day.  If you were wondering a SNB is where they inject a tracer dye and remove the nearest 2 or 3 lymph nodes to the tumour to check to see if any cells have got trapped there.

The main items to get hold of are something for both constipation and diarrhoea as one can quickly turn to the other :-/ A digital thermometer (doesn't have to be a really expensive one) We used a cheapo from Asda which we found accurate enough. A packet of Ginger Nut and Arrowroot biscuits they both help in different ways - Ginger Nuts help with taste issues and Arrowroot with nausea or queasiness.  Generic brands of Paracetamol and Ibuprofen because if needed you can alternate between the two at 2 hourly intervals instead of just 4 hourly with paracetamol only. Supermarket multi buys of various bottled flavoured waters (still or fizzy) as you need at least 2 litres of fluid daily while on chemo as Tea / Coffee may taste awful... Soft (baby) toothbrush in case your gums get sore and some Chlorhexidine antibacterial mouthwash - Lloyds, Superdrug and Boots all sell their own brand at a round £3 a bottle to help avert oral thrush. Tin of Pineapple Chunks which you can open and put in the fridge in case you need to sooth a gunky mouth. Do get back to us when you find which Chemo Cocktail you will be having,. Take care, G n' J",

Post menopause with the ovaries shutdown you will be given the AI's. There can be variations and crossovers though. Like if you are approaching the meno you can be placed on Tamoxifen for a couple of years then they change you onto the AI's - or if you can't get on with the AI's they can switch you back to Tamoxifen.

There are a lot of members here taking these various types / brands of hormone therapy tablets and you see a snapshot of everyone's problems, so it all gets magnified out of proportion. The drug companies don't exactly help by including a massive list of common and not so common side effects but that doesn't mean you will get them all  - Thankfully..... If you do get placed on one of the generic brands and it doesn't agree with you, get your pharmacy to switch you to another brand and see what differences you feel. It only usually takes a few swaps to find one that is better for you. Pharmacists can change brands of the same drug without having to go through your GP, that is why some never seem to get the same brand on a regular basis. You will only need to go the GP route if you want to change your prescription from one drug to another like Letrozole to Anastrozole etc, from any generic to a specific brand that you prefer entered in the system as your repeat.

Someone who  fits PICC Lines may not be allowed to fit Hickmans/Groshong lines or Ports. In a larger hospital this isn't usually a problem but in a more local unit you may only get offered what they can fit ? In our local unit they had someone specifically come round every Wednesday from Addenbrooke's to actually fit them.

      "Content": "Hi Jo, Pleased to read your infection / lack of healing seems to be at last turning a corner. Bummer about the Herceptin but 7 sessions is better than none. There was an original trial (PHARE) with Herceptin being given for 6 months instead of 12 did show there only seemed to be a 2% difference in recurrence between 6 and 12 months.  The much newer and larger 'Persophone Trial' results are due in sometime this year but if the first set of figures are anything to go by it may end up with Herceptin only being given for 6 months as standard anyway. Of course 6 months equates to 9 sessions so you are still 2 short of that figure. There are other Monoclonal Antibody type drugs - Drugs that specifically block HER2 to stop the growth of cancer cells are called HER2-targeted therapies. Examples of these drugs include trastuzumab (Herceptin), lapatinib (Tykerb), pertuzumab (Perjeta), and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), commonly referred to as T-DM1. How many of these partly contain Herceptin in their make up I have no idea. Kadcyla (T-DM1) contains Herceptin but NICE stopped that one because of it's hefty price. I think some of the others are for HER2+ secondary cancers (mets) so they may not be available either but it gives you a few names to check out and ask about ? Good luck, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi ks1966  I'm not a resilient lady (stop sniggering you lot) but I am married to one  :) Most ladies get switched from Tamoxifen to one of the AI's (aromatase inhibitors) like Letrozole or Anastrozole once the blood test confirms they are now post menopausal. Main reason for this is most of the oestogen which was produced by the ovaries have shut down so there is more of a need to stop oestrogen being produced from other areas like the adrenal glands and fatty tissue etc. You can read more about this clicking this link. Has your girlfriend been offered a Dexa Bone Density Scan ? As long term AI's can cause some bone thinning and a dexa scan will give base bone density levels to find if she would benefit from any bone strengthening meds to help avoid osteopaenia later. J finished her 5 years on Letrozole about 6 months back - so if you have any more questions about these, just holler :) If she hasn't it may be worth asking her oncologist or GP to arrange a Dexa - they are minor scans and only take around 20 mins. Hope this is of some help, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya Mandz1001  If you have had no treatment yet but facing surgery next week this sounds like it could be a stress related reaction - perhaps partly due to chemical changes within the body caused by the fight or flight reflex ? Our daughter got very stressed out just before her driving test (not like a burning reaction though) and her GP told her to get some Bach Rescue Remedy from the chemist. I wouldn't normally recommend herbals but this stuff seemed to actually help her. Think it was around £8 - £10 If you can calm yourself down a tad and reduce your stress levels perhaps this rection will ease off, if not maybe this Bach is worth a try  ? G n' J",

Think this is primarily for Pre Menopausal patients who are ER+ Positive and HER2- Negative to treat Advanced or Metastatic breast cancer, but there may be other types this can help with ? BUT - They may also be referring to Perjeta / Pertuzamab which also isn't freely availabe in Scotland yet, although south of the border in England is used in conjunction with Herceptin as the newer regime for HER2+ positive BC (TCHP) Hope this helps with any research :)   G n' J",

Assuming you are post meno so no oestrgoen from your ovaries but oestrogen is still produced by the adrenal glands and from body fat cells. Which will be why you were placed on them originally - so this may be starting to kick in a little after coming off the tablets. You could use the free phone 0808 808 0000 support line number and have a chat with one of the Macmillan cancer nurses about this as they will have more experience of this than I do and may have a helpful solution to it. Jackie still has just over a year on Letrozole so has this to come :( There aren't many around here who are 5 years on from treatment as most gradually stop posting after a few years - once they have gotten used to the 'new normal' There may be several who have stopped taking them early though, so fingers crossed you'll get more replies.

You can find these listed on the Mac chemo page here. Some like Taxol / Paclitaxel will be listed under individual drugs in the left hand menu. It would help if you could find out the other chemo drug names that are going to be in option 3. This could determine if this is the easier option regarding side effects ?

Er' Lobular accounts for around 10 - 15% of all breast cancers and Pleomorphic forms are around 15% of those - So we're talking around 1 in every 400 of all those with breast cancer which is not so much rare as uncommon. Over 4,000 women are diagnosed with BC in the UK every month to give you an idea about this. Don't let this get you fretting though all it means is probably a couple of tweaks to the standard breast cancer treatment to allow for this, as all treatment and chemo regimes are specifically tailored to the patient. Don't forget to take pen and paper with you to write down any answers to your question list and try to have someone with you as 4 ears are better than two in case you miss something. Easily done as you latch onto some comment and forget what else is being said. How are you feeling post surgery, recovering well or any problems ? Oh! and yes, everyone absolutely hates the waiting times - in a lot of cases it seems worse than the treatment :-( Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya, It really is about time these therapy centres read up on massage regarding cancer patients rather than just blanket banning it without a get out of jail free card from a medic. For the most part it's all about their own liability insurance and the risk of being taken to court and publicity :-( As far as breast cancer patients go as long as the therapists stay clear or any arm that may have had lymph surgery on (unless qualified for lymph massage too) it isn't a problem. The text below was taken from the Complimentary Therapies booklet  from BCC. It has been said that people who have had cancer should not have massage because of the risk of moving cancer cells from one part of the body to another. This is not true, although it is important to tell your massage therapist about your breast cancer history. If you have had surgery to the lymph glands under your arm, it is best to avoid having deep tissue massage to that arm unless your therapist has also been trained in a specialist type of massage known as manual lymphatic drainage.

When you get to feel like this, grab a friend or family member and do something a little special, or go somewhere nice, even if it's just a yak in a coffee shop just to take your mind off it, anything to stop your smile turning upside down  :-) As our sub text says - Today is a gift. Take Care Dianne, and best wishes,  George & Jackie.",

Phew, that was a long sentence..... There are quite a few of us that just feel pointing new members in the right direction to get the best help for their situation within this vast site , reporting scam/dubious posts to admin and offering info, a helping hand or a shoulder is the very least we can do after owing Macmillan so'ooo much for the help they gave us early on and all through treatment. We have to tread a fine line between not sugar coating stuff, but not scaring the crap out of people too but hey, we're ALL in this together trying to top up each others glasses. This place is amazing and the inner strength of those who come here always inspires us. Enjoy what is left of the weekend, we'll soon get the chance to say good riddance to 2013 a year some would rather forget.....  Hugs, George & Jackie",

I would have a chat with your oncologist to see what the minimal ammount of chemo you would safely need (allowing to compensate for your other issues) to qualify for the HER2+ therapies - or at least ask them to put your data through the NHS Predict Tool to see what % of benefit chemo etc would give you over a 5 and 10 year period. Do ask them outright for an honest prognosis as you need as much info as possible to make an educated decision. Am I right in thinking achalasia is an oesophagus problem ? G n' J",

It is tough when you first start because if you start suffering with aches all it may need is a change to a different brand to ease the twinges but whatever ones you take they will all bring on some bone / joint pain it is the lack of oestrogen causing this.

Not that anything is normal with treatment :-)  OK 20 questions time.... Have you had any surgery yet or are you having the chemo first and what type of chemo have they got you on and are you having the 3 weekly sessions or the weekly ones ? What part of the lobular bit are you trying to get your head around ? This What is Lobular info may help a bit (link) but if you ask specific questions we'll all chip in and sort your curiosity out.

Don't get too involved with stats and figures everyone is different all you need to realise is the survivability for breast cancer is around 90% - They will chuck everything you need tailored to your diagnosis to prevent any re-occurance at you. Does it mention of your path report if you are ER+ and / or HER2+ positive or do you not know that as yet ? If ER+ you will get the 5 years of tablets - if HER2+ you will be given Herceptin too.

There is no 'better' cancer to get, they are all cr@p be it TN, Inflammatory, HER2, BRCA related and all the other many variations. Those with DCIS that are triple positive (HER2+ ER/PR+) face mastectomy, 6 or 8 x chemo a year of Herceptin, then radiotherapy and to top it all off, 5 or 10 years of hormone tablets that make you feel you are aged 80 :( Prior to Herceptin HER2+ in any type of BC was up there as just about the most aggressive and fastest growing type to get lumbered with and prognosis was really poor. That is why there was hell to pay when NICE wasn't going to license Herceptin for use within the NHS (the original postcode lottery drug) We're all in this together and a lot of members here appreciate the information Chloecat provides about her personal experiences from doing it 'her way'  -  Indeed some members have found nuggets of info that provides help easing some treatment side effects in a complimentary direction. No one here (including Chloecat) would ever say this is the way to go but it's great she is willing to share her unconventional approach.  Who knows in the near future maybe we may all be taking some of these compounds as a standard treatment for this evil disease ?

A line is so'ooo much easier, not only for the fluids going in, but for any bloods taken too. Only downside is it has to be flushed once a week to stop it getting blocked. Jackie got hers fitted after it took them ages to get the 1st lot of chemo in.  I'm surprised they didn't fit one after you mentioned it the 2nd time. Might be a more positive outcome if you phone and ask your Onco Dr instead of the nurses. Worth a try ?  Hope this helps and very best of luck,  George & jackie. ",

Sessions are quicker too. Jackie had a Groshong line in for around 15 months (chemo and herceptin) no problems whatsoever with it. They used hers for taking bloods too as an added bonus. There is some info here about PICC lines and a video - Central lines are listed on the left and side if you wish to check and compare. Adding to what Moll mentioned - the onco sister trained me to flush the line weekly to save us coming in to the unit. For obvious reasons it has to be carried out under sterile practice. G  n' J",

Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has recently updated their web page about Chemo Brain with further information about it. Just hit the link to have a read. Thought it would be a great opportunity to have a laugh about all this too, so I'll start the ball rolling. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Jackie was starting her chemo she had a Groshong iv line fitted as she was also having 18 x Herceptin. The sister in the onco unit asked if we wanted to avoid coming into town weekly (a 25 mile round trip) she would show me how to flush the line etc. Great, I can do this........ My chance to step up to the plate and actually do something useful. I got on so well first time at the unit under supervision, but it was a different matter first time at home............. It had been drummed into me exactly how to go about this and to keep everything very sterile. Opened a syringe pack and it flipped out of the packet across the room and our cat ran after it, so had to open another  (Not a good start) Went to fill the second syringe from the saline bottle and managed to get most of it running down my arm and dripping from my elbow and used two full bottles to get about 20 mil in the syringe. They must have known me so well as we seemed to have several of everything  :-) Ended up shutting the cat out of the room as he found the dangling iv line too much of a temptation. Then I found they latex gloves they gave me fitted a five year old perfectly, they were so small it was like I had webbed fingers and then one split. Right, all packs now opened and gloved up, lets get on with this..... How did that nurse unfold those little alcohol wipes wearing latex gloves so easily, Gr'rrr. Grasping the other empty syringe I undid the cap from the line and proceeded to withdraw a little blood first to clear the line before flushing. That went ok, Ooops a little blood comes out the end and misses the bib altogether, good shot on the cream jumper though. By this time we are laughing so much we didn't care anymore. After using about half a roll of steritape most of it attached to my gloves I managed to get enough on Jackie to hold the line in place. It was a sharp learning curve but after a few flushes I got quite proficient at it, but we still crack up when we talk about my 1st time. Which just goes to show it's not only those having chemo that suffer from chemo brain LOL G n' J",

I think any lymph nodes below a nipple could be part of the lower axillary (armpit) chain tail end and those on the sturnam are called Parasternal ? There is a condition which can cause inflamation of cartilage between the ribs and the sturnam called Costochondritis, but could more likely be power port related. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hello Meeralax, Welcome to the Breast Group, a great place to be at a tough time. What you are feeling is very normal, it's a combination of your bodies reaction to the all battering it has had and the uneasy feeling that you still feel rough even though your treatments are nearly over. It can take good 6 - 12 months for you to recover and clear the residue chemo from your system. You mention your feet feel numb, are your fingers OK or are they suffering from numbness, pins and needles a bit as well ? This sounds like a touch of Peripheral Neuropathy which is nerve damage and is mostly but not always from either Taxotere / Docetaxel or Taxol / Paclitaxel Have you taken this up with anyone (GP or Onco) as you can get meds that ease it..... Please try not to feel lonely, you are definitely not alone, at a guess well over half of the ladies here get moments like this even when surrounded by family and friends. It's like no one can really understand what you have been through and how you now feel. How are the Rads going for you - any problems arising from those ?  This far into your rads 23 sessions will no doubt be making you feel tired too, what with that and all the daily traveling which won't be helping. Take care, G n' J",

If you click this link for the R2 it will take you to the webpage where you can have a read about it. I don't know if this is available in France but there is a 'contact us' link on the page to check about this, failing that you can buy it online from them I think a 6 week course is around £40 we can get it free on prescription in the UK. However there are alternatives that may be cheaper and easier to get hold of, depends on how bad your skin has been left post rads ? Hopefully answering this will 'bump' your post and you will get some other replies now :) Take care, Oh! and welcome to the 'Boobygone' club..... G n' J",

A line is so'ooo much easier, not only for the fluids going in, but for any bloods taken too. Only downside is it has to be flushed once a week to stop it getting blocked. Jackie got hers fitted after it took them ages to get the 1st lot of chemo in.  I'm surprised they didn't fit one after you mentioned it the 2nd time. Might be a more positive outcome if you phone and ask your Onco Dr instead of the nurses. Worth a try ?  Hope this helps and very best of luck,  George & jackie. ",

It is not something that occurs very often but it does happen,  so It makes sense to try and avoid this risk if you can. I think having veins like that for the rest of my life would be more freaky.

After drinking several glasses of beer , he asked his hosts if he could use their personal bathroom. When he entered the Clintons private toilet he was astonished to see that Bill had a golden urinal . Wow ! The next day , Obama told his wife , Michelle , about the urinal in Clintons private lavatory. \"Just think \" he said \" maybe I should get a gold urinal too\"  But on the other hand I think that it may be just a bit too flashy...even for a guy like me. Later in the week , when Michelle had lunch with Hilary , she told her how impressed her husband had been at discovering that Bill had a gold urinal in his private bathroom. Later that day , when Bill got home , Hilary smiled and said Hi Honey, guess what.... \" I found out who pee'd into your saxophone \"",

Thanks for bumping this Lesley as it brought it to my attention Some can lose a few nails due to chemo but it isn't one of the more common side effcts apart from nail ridges, colouration changes etc. However my wife lost ALL 20 of her nails over an 8 week period - This started happening about 2 months after her last Docetaxel and was a bit of a surprise.  If we had been forewarned we could have saved them all and made a Voodoo Necklace to sell on eBay  lol They did turn up in some odd places too - surviving a washing machine cycle hiding in a sock - in the bath or bed... Good news is that when her nails lifted there was a new but thinner nail already formed underneath so she didn't actually go nailess. I'm assuming these grew during the 3 month post tax period? Are you still having chemo ? as this may mean you may not have the new nail layer underneath. Most here who don't taped their loose nails with stuff like steri-strip plaster to avoid getting them caught or snagging on clothing or bedding  etc. If you are still on chemo last thing you want is an open wound on your fingers. Hopefully some of the other ladies here can advise what they did to help with piano key fingernails :-/ Take Care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Marie,  They really should standardise all the hormone inhibitor tablets. Letrozole, Tamoxifen, Arimidex etc they all seem to have the same problems with the fillers (added compounds to dilute the drug for slower release or many other reasons) They are not allowed to make them exactly the same as the original because of patents - all they need by law is to contain the correct dosage of letrozole drug per tablet in them  - same goes for all the other anti hormone tabs.  This also explains why some are dif shapes and colours. They mustn't look exactly like the originals  - it's a minefield :-( Problem is everyone reacts differently. A brand that suits someone else may not suit you and vice versa. It's really a case of making notes about which ones you take and how you 'feel' after you have been on them a couple of weeks. Then after a while when you have tried several dif makes you see a pattern emerging. Then is the time to make a choice and ask your pharmacy to just get those ones for you. It's not easy as there can be six or more generic companies making these tablets after the original makers license runs out. Coupled with the fact the original makes usually tend to be more expensive than the other brands making them cheaper to supply. They are cheaper because these generic tablets don't need testing as the original was, and they have no research and trials to pay for up front. The original makers name for Letrozole is Femara, you can still get it, but it is now the most expensive so unless it states Femara on your repeat prescription you can be supplied with any make which is called Letrozole. A lot of gp's and others may try to tell you they are all the same, but those taking them know this simply isn't true. Sorry it's a pet hate of ours, almost turned into a rant  LOL Take care, hope you find one that's suitable, G n' J ",

      "Content": "Hi  Grapevine,  Sounds to us like a bad case of chemo anxiety, fear of any / all the side effects you feel you may encounter in a few days time. Try not to stress, easier said than done we know, but no amount of fretting will alter the outcome and only make you feel worse. You just have to go with it. It probably won't be too long before you catch up on your sleep as you'll feel so wiped out you won't be able to fight it and you can crash out having sofa snuggle sessions. Maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones who sail through it, everyone is different after all........ Write a brief daily chemo diary noting any s/e's and temp variations, how you are feeling and if you encounter anything that causes you sickness, stress or pain inform your onco unit and get some help, They wouldn't want you to suffer in silence so please don't  :-)   There are remedies for the side effects so claim them as soon as you feel you need help.  The diary can also be a good comparison point for future treatments but you soon get used to what to expect and all the chemo sessions get ticked off so quickly once you start. We're at the far end of treatment, and don't post here as much as we used to. Jackie has just 3 more sessions of 18 herceptin and her line can come out and has been back at work for  4 months. Loving the new normal and even her Labradoodle curly hair which was poker straight before. Do keep us up to date with how you are progressing, we'll all guide you through this and try to keep a smile on your face.  Take care,  George & Jackie. ",

For most this does ease off after a few days but can leave you with fuzzy head for around a week.  If you are one of the unfortunate souls who suffered from headaches or migraine prior to BC no doubt the FEC may make it may feel worse than what you were used to ? If it is of any help you can alternate with Paracetamol and something like Ibuprofen so you can take tablets 2 hourly - as long as the other tablets don't contain any paracetamol to avoid overdosing on it.

This is something we all dread most - It takes back to the dark days of first diagnosis all over again. Every twinge and ache gets you thinking but you push it to the back of your mind until you just have to get it checked out. With further radiation and bone strengthening drugs they can get on top of this and get you mobile again soon. Have no idea if this will mean another trip on the chemo roller coaster ? Putting in a link to a Maccy book about Bone Secondaries - you may feel like you don't want to read it yet, but the link is there for when you do. Dunno what to say buddy, not often I'm stuck for words... At least they are onto it quickly and it is very treatable. Oh, just remembered, don't forget there is a Bone Secondary Group here which may help with treatment advice when we are clueless..... I'm gonna go and kick something now and swear a lot, you take care Emma. Huge group hugs, George & Jackie",

These come in 3 grades, benign (around 50%) then borderline or malignant. Probably meaning surgery to remove it for the borderline and malignant types. Any particular reason for thinking this could be Phyllodes as there are quite a few other benign breast conditions this could be instead ? Like Carolyn said this feeling of being disconnected is very common and a very natural state of mind, you probably went through something very similar with your original diagnosis too - Almost like you are looking in on someone else's problem. Hope you get good news from the biopsies and not too sore afterwards. Best wishes for Friday, take care, G n' J",

I know Heather77 who has just had surgery was taking Letrozole for a year prior to surgery and her post surgery pathology results were excellent. The newest published comparison (2011) between Anastrozole and Letrozole I found was carried out by the Edinburgh Breast Unit, Western General Hospital which you can read here. It is by it's very nature a bit 'techie' as it is aimed at other medical folks, but you should be able to read between the lines and gain some info. As to why some choose one over the other I haven't any idea - I assume it is based on all the info they have on your age, diagnosis and medical history etc. If you are ER/PR+ positive and the tablets are cutting off a cancer food food supply that has to be a good thing and outweigh the side effects ?

Nearly all breast cancers are invasive - it certainly doesn't mean it has invaded all over the place within you personally. It just means it has grown through the duct or milk lobule wall that it started in and it only has to reach a size of around 5mm to do that. As for analysing every ache and pain you have to learn to control that as you will be doing this for the rest of your life now. Once diagnosed we are so worried about re-occurance that first fear never goes away so for your own sanity you have to think what the heck, what will be will be and get on with it, or life becomes a misery. What are those lyrics from Disney's Frozen Let It Go - It's funny how some distance, makes everything seem small. And the fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all It's time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through. No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I'm free! In a few months you will be free too. Take care, G n' J",

I don't know if this is of any help at all but you would be having needles for the pre med before either surgery and you probably had a core biopsy needle used to diagnose you at the breast clinic ? A similar hollow needle is used to place the titanium marker so would be nothing worse than you already had.  Opting for a mastectomy instead of a WLE (lumpectomy) seems a bit of a drastic step to feel forced into :-/ I do hope someone else with a fear of needles replies to you with options they found helped with this dilemma.  Maybe hypnotherapy or something that slowly gets you to accepting and overcoming this fear. First of all you need to make it very clear to your medical team that you are not just a bit afraid of needles, but that they scare the crap out of you. They should take you seriously and totally numb the area first, maybe take a stress ball or something similar with you and concentrate on squeezing the life out of that rather than thinking about what is happening ?

The symptoms for Inflammatory Breast Cancer (info page link) can be quite different to other breast cancers which can include skin taking on an orange peel appearance, dimpling,  pinkness, feeling hot, nipple discharge etc Know it is hard but if you do feel the need to use Dr Google please stick with reputable sites like Macmillan, BreastCancerCare and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) as a lot of the info out there is well outdated and worryingly misleading :( Fingers crossed for tomorrow's results, take care, G n' J",

If you feel the time is right and you want to go the recon route, you read through all the different methods of recon (if given the choice) and go for the type of recon which you feel is best for you without any idea of what the final outcome can look like. Imagine a lot of us don't actually realise how much damage and scarring to other areas will follow the surgery. All you usually see are either mastectomy scars without any recon, or standard recon with expanders or implants. Certainly opened our eyes and a big thank you for her doing that. Another point is the huge amount of people who \"unfriended\" her after she posted the images. Just goes to show how shallow and quick to judge a lot of people are, similar to how some of us find out who your friends really are by the way they react to you when diagnosed  :-( Group Hugs, George & Jackie",

There is a brilliant uk website for children who have a parent diagnosed though called RipRap. It has been vetted by the Cancer Research UK (CRUK) charity and is recommended by them in cases just like this.  Do check it out and see if you feel it may be suitable for your children as they may feel the need to mix and chat with their own age groups about their worries and concerns. Mouseover or click the coloured 'beans' at riprap to check out their areas. Hope this is of help. Seems a lot of your Q's have been sorted, but if you need any specific info just holler.

      "Content": "Hi Saranghae, What are the chemotherapy drugs you mum has been given up to now - FEC by any chance ? You mention she may be going onto a weekly chemo regime and yes Taxol also known as Paclitaxel is the most common breast cancer chemo that is given weekly. It has half the potency of Docetaxel (which is given every 3 weeks) but being weekly is just as efficient at doing the job but is kinder in regards to side effects as it carries lower toxicity - so 9 weeks of Taxol is the equivalent of 3 x 3 weekly Docetaxel which is the standard dosage in the UK (usually following 3 x FEC) The surgery aspect depends on the amount of shrinkage from the chemo. If the results keep coming back good they will carry on and she will probably have the complete course. If it looks like they chemo has gone as far as it can with shrinkage they will operate and she may have to continue to finish the chemo course after surgery It doesn't really matter which way round this is carried out as long as the way they go about it is best for her. Her tumour being ulcerated will benefit from the chemo first as it will zap any cells that may escape from the tumour. There is some info about Taxol here.... Hope this is of some help, it must be really tough for you being so far away from your mum. If you have any other questions do reply, we're all here to help. Take care and good luck to your mum with her continuing chemo. G n' J",

Most of these tablets you get if ER+ will shut down your Oestrogen and that can effect your bones / joints and can lead to being osteopeanic - (bone thinning) so you end up taking non steroidal pain relief and calcium plus Vit D tablets to help with that.

Macmillan has a booklet 'Talking to Children and Teenagers When An Adult has Cancer' which covers most aspects - Just click the green text link and when the page opens you can save it for future reference.  There's also a bit more info relating to informing schools and colleges - Just to keep the school in the loop and can keep an eye on them. Which you can find here. Our daughter was older and had just started Uni when we told her, but this info will give you something to read while you waiting replies from those with children of nearer the same age. If she needs to talk to other teenagers going through this so she can discuss her concerns and worries - There is a very good support website for teenagers called RipRap Org I've made it a link so you can check it out yourself for suitability if needed. It has been 'vetted' by Cancer Research uk (CRUK) Hope this helps, take care, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Hi Vonnie, You certainly are getting a rough ride from this TC cocktail :-( Various eyesight problems are a known side effect of some chemo drugs inc TC - It is probably tied in with chemo affecting the nerves rather than your eyes, same as with your feet and toes. This is called Peripheral Neuropathy This can be tingling and / or numbness but in some cases it can lead to feeling painful like burns and can even blister so do keep an eye on them. Friction tends to make this worse things like step exercises, walking uphill, or stairs so try to keep the pressure off whenever you can. It can also affect your hands so be careful with the friction thing again especially with simple tasks like unscrewing bottle caps or jar lids etc. Sounds like a duvet afternoon on the sofa may be on the cards today. Take care, G n' J",

Most of these tablets you get if ER+ will shut down your Oestrogen and that can effect your bones / joints and can lead to being osteopeanic - (bone thinning) so you end up taking non steroidal pain relief and calcium plus Vit D tablets to help with that. If you have just started Letrozole have they given or offered you a 'Dexa' scan yet to check your bone density ? Didn't mean to scare you....

Some people at this stage go one of two ways - Finding spicy well flavoured foods are the only ones they can actually taste the flavours in, or those who can only manage bland tasting food. Another thing which can help with a furry mouth is a rinse with bicarbonate of soda.

Now they are trialling it for some Head & Neck and Lung cancers and also those who are TNBC (triple negative) and it is the first trial of a Monoclonal Antibody drug that works like Herceptin for those that are HER2- Negative. Part of the trial arm is also for those who are HER+ positive but whose cancer has spread despite having Herceptin. I think but am not certain but I think it's for those who are diagnosed as 'advanced' but that could be adbvanced head &neck and lung patients. It would well be worth checking out what the criteria is for those who Triple Neg. So could be very good news on the horizon for TNBC'ers. There is a bit of info here about it.

      "Content": "Hi Tiggy62  You are certainly not alone with this. Nearly everyone really underestimates the hours they can handle on a phased return :( Especially in a demanding nursing / caring role as most of the shifts are long hours. A lot of employers in health care seem to be unwilling to accommodate short hour shifts as it messes their rotas up and if your phased return is trying one long shift per week it takes you the other 6 days to recover from it :( Another issue which rears it's head is post cancer treatment you tend to lose confidence in picking up where you left off, where you easily made correct snap decisions you now really have to think about things more. It's as if you no longer trust yourself regarding your abilities. Even stuff you took for granted like drug calculations and administering can seem a nightmare to get back into ? Rather than trying to muddle through and feeling even worse about yourself, do tell them you need more time to get back into the swing of things and get a more realistic phased return put in place. 2 weeks is nowhere near enough time to build on, you would need more like 3 maybe 4 months of gradual increase. You have been through a heck of a lot and post chemo it can take a year for all the good cells that got wiped out to get back to near normal levels. You say 9 months off but in reality you probably didn't finish your chemo sessions until what, late March time ? You can do this, just ease yourself into it slowly. Hugs, G n' J",

Looks like you will be here for the long haul, the lovely ladies here will make you feel welcome and you can all support and help each other and even share a few smiles along the way. Having all your lymph nodes removed is more painful than just having a few removed as a sample and as you are probably finding more sore than the breast surgery too. There can be a lot of nodes as well - everyone has a different number. It can be as few as 8 but some ladies have over 30.... Obviously the more they need to remove the bigger the surgery wound. Don't know what pain relief they have given you but if it doesn't seem to be doing much do try and get some better ones as the annaesthetic fades off it may get a little worse before it starts getting better, a few days after surgery you may get a little teary too, not only because of what you have been through, it is also an annaesthetic side effect. It's a bummer they found cells in your nodes but in a lot of cases there are. It's the lymph nodes job to trap these to stop them going elsewhere in your body, so in that respect they have done their job. It's early days as yet but I assume you have been given a leaflet with the post breast surgery exercises in ? As for the chemo it is usually 6 sessions, sometimes 8 spaced 3 weeks apart - so we're talking around 20 weeks in total. Sounds a long time but it's surprising how quickly the sessions get ticked off. The most common chemo regime is called FEC-T which is 3 or 4 sessions of each. Mostly it's FEC (fec is 3 separate drugs) first then T which is Taxotere (also known as Docetaxel) but not always in that order. Don't be too alarmed at some of the posts here about chemo, no doubt about it, it's tough at times because it has a tough job to do, but you do get a good week every session. Some find it harder than others as it treats everyone differently. Looks like you got another tough 2 weeks thinking time before you get the surgery results ;-( Hugs, G n' J",

Here's a little something that may resemble the path you are on at the moment...You will reach the end and enter the sunshine again :-) G n' J",

If you 'hit' the number 1 at the bottom of the page it will take you to the first post and there is a link to Chemo Aids which you can read to help you with any side effects. FEC is mostly associated with feeling nauseous. When you have your first session you will be given anti sickness meds....Take them even if you feel ok, because it's easier to keep on top of it if they are in your system. If you hold back and are actually sick you won't know if you brought the tablets up or not :-(   It's recommended you drink 2 litres of fluid a day to help flush it through your kidneys and recover quicker. You may find you go off hot drinks (which may taste weird or even awful) but there are plenty of alternatives. Are you using the 'cold cap' to try and preserve some of your hair, or not bothering ? Keep posting if you have any questions, as there's not much time for us to get some answers in for you by tomorrow... Take care, G n' J",

They are fitted in around 30 minutes using a local so you barley feel it and it's a tad uncomfortable for a day or two rather than painful. A couple of ladies here have had problems with them but most find them well worth it. You can read more about them using this link.... Regarding the T part of chemo - You white count can bottom out more with T than FEC. Some health authority area units give G-CSF injections as standard to build up your white count but you do still have to monitor your temp a couple of times a day (including first thing in the morning prior to taking any paracetamol) to get a more accurate reading. If your temp goes above 37.5 they ask you to phone the unit, to come in and get an infection check and possibly give you anti-biotics. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Maria  / Maria 712  Pleased to read after all your normal pre surgery nerves it doesn't seem to be as bad as you were expecting. How it pans out from here is that the removed tissue goes to pathology and they double check there is a margin of healthy tissue around it. This ensures it has all been removed. In some cases if margins are not clear or too tight to call they have you back in and take a little more tissue. This news can knock you back a bit if they find this but it is soon sorted out. It will takes about a week to get this information from the lab, they may also check it for hormone receptor status if they haven't mentioned ER positive or negative or HER2 to you yet. Once you get told you have clear margins that means all the tumour is gone. All other follow up treatment like chemo, herceptin (if needed) radiotherapy and any hormone inhibitor tablets you may be offered is all added insurance to minimise any recurrence at a later date.  This stage is classed as NED no evidence of disease - That is as good as it gets because they simply cannot find single cells anywhere in the body at a cellular level but chemo should zap those if any exist, this is less likely seeing you say your nodes were clear :) 18 chemo sessions seems a lot, so I think you need clarification on this, you will get that information from the oncologist. The standard dose for Herceptin is 18 sessions and this is given with chemo so perhaps this is what they mean ? As soon as you hear you have clear margins, you can rest assured the tumour has definitely gone :) Good luck with your recovery and getting news of clear margins - Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Carrie, Telling close family about your diagnosis is a toughie, but it will help you to share as this will lift the burden you have been keeping mostly to yourself for a while. To have a read of some advice regarding telling adults you can check out page 19 in this Talking About Cancer booklet (link). Telling your girls will be the worst, do if possible tell them all together. Firstly it saves you having to repeat everything and the natural teary session again but it saves anyone from feeling left out and wondering why they got told last ? Do check out Talking To Children and Teenagers  see page 4 (teens start on page 20) for some info about how you may need to be cautious with info regarding your 15 year old it's a hormonal angsty time at best without the bombshell you are about to drop. Luckily she has her older sisters to help her as well. They will pick up on how you break the news so if possible try to do this in a calm way or you could frighten them into thinking they are going to lose you if you appear really frightened about it all. Be prepared if you can by having some info written down in case they ask questions, if it's something you can't answer yet ask you team or post here depending on how much you have been told so far. If you are going to be given chemo ask if your chemo unit has scalp cooling facilities (not all do) this can save some of your hair - it is a bit hit or miss - works well for some but not everyone benefits from it as any of these drugs used affect people differently. Good luck with informing everyone, keep plenty of tissues handy but most of all although you may be scared witless try to keep everyone positive - remember over 90% with BC kick cancer where it hurts and gets through all this. You got grade 1 on your side, even if this gets upgraded to a 2 after closer inspection, know it's not much consolation but this could have been so much worse.

Switching from Letrozole to Anastrozole can help but mostly you end up just swapping one lot of side effects for another set :-( If you have already had one this problem may need some help with as 5 years is a long time to be on these pesky tablets. J is nearly 3 years into Letrozole and also has to take Adcal+ Vit D3 and Alendronic Acid to help with the joint pains. There has been replies here about K2 and chelated magnesium helping so hopefully you will get some replies about those. Another good point raised by Rain Forest is the make of your tablets. There are around half a dozen companies making these and it could be another 'brand' will be kinder to you. The drug is the same it's the different fillers which can cause issues. If you let us know which brand you are taking other ladies here can reply mentioning which ones suited them better, or if they had similar problems with the same make. G n' J",

You will need to enter cancer related family details including grandparents, parents, aunt's, uncles etc. So have this info to hand. You can note or print out the results to hand over as background information to whoever may need it. Just a thought - Prostate cancer in men can also be linked to BRCA, don't know if this means anything regarding your family history ? G n' J",

Triple positive: positive for oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 Triple negative: not positive for oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2 Probable treatment for Triple Positive = surgery, chemo, herceptin, radiotherapy and 5-10 years of hormone inhibitor tablets. Probable treatment for Triple Negative = Chemo, surgery, radiotherapy and crossed fingers for 5 years. These two were considered the nasty types to get for recurrence risks - Herceptin has changed that greatly for those who are HER2+ This race is on now for a targeted biological therapy for those who are triple negative and could be promising for TN.

Are you still also taking the med's for speeding up your heart rate, or have you now stopped taking those ? Just wondering is there is some combined reaction going on between them. Otherwise you can probably put it down to the Letrozole. As long as you aren't getting breathlessness with it as that could be a symptom of a blood clot and would definitely need checking out asap.

Even if no nodes are involved they still mostly give you a CT scan at sometime, It's more of an information finding mission to help them finalise your treatment plan.

Some offer nothing and use the cannula in the back of the hand or lower arm method - other ways include a PICC line which is fitted in the upper arm, an iv line like Groshong or Hickman that is fitted in the upper chest and a Port o' Cath which is mostly fitted in the upper chest but below and covered by the skin. You can read more about these methods clicking this link. It is a shame because if she had asked at the pre-chemo appointment (depending on how they usually administer chemo) she may have been able to have the more common PICC line fitted for free but if she actually asked for the Port and it is something they don't normally do they will of couse offer this as a private procedure :( Maybe this wasn't explained very well to them at the time but as mentioned it may be worth the family involved taking it up with their hospitals PALS (patients advice and liaison service) to at least get an explanation.

I think the question most ask of themselves in this predicament is - \"How would I feel if I ducked out of chemo and it came back in 5 years\"  :-/ You can ask about the oncotype test but it seems they have for whatever reasons already assumed this is the best way forward for you. Chemo can leave you with some long term health problems besides any fertility aspects but as usual with any of these treatments, you don't know until you have already gone through them how they may affect you (stable door - bolted horse) G n' J",

If the first test is borderline or inconclusive they use the other test to double check, so the status can change because of this. It wouldn't hurt as Jo says to ask them to clarify this for you. If you 'were' triple positive I assume you are still ER/PR+ positive so the TN Group wouldn't be for you in that case. You will be placed onto hormone Inhibitor tablets for 5 - 10 years. NICE states to be given Herceptin you have to have it in conjunction with chemotherapy so if you no longer need the Herceptin this is why you may not need chemo either. They may have said 3% over 5 years but did they give you the predicted figure for 10 years also ? So this is something else to ask the oncologist about when you meet them, oncologists also cover radiotherapy so this could be your next step ? The oncologist may also ask if you want chemotherapy anyway to help avoid recurrence so be prepared for this scenario if your results are boderline for needing chemo or not. Hope this is of some help, good luck with your post op recovery, and keep up with the post surgery exercises they help at the rads stage. Take  care, G n' J",

It is very unusual for ovarian cysts (which are very common) to be cancerous. You can read more about them here. Obviously you now need to get these double checked for your own peace of mind as some can get quite large. If they are only smallish, you may just be monitored for now. As for the side effects of the Tamoxifen, all these hormone inhibitor tablets are tough going. Oestrogen is a feel good hormone and it takes a while to adjust to not having it flowing through you like it did previously hence the mood swings etc. It may be worth you trying a different brand of Tamoxifen as there are several different makes and some find a particular brand easier to cope with and stick with those. If you reply stating which 'brand' you are taking hopefully other ladies here can comment on which brands they have tried and which ones worked better for them ? Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Daisy, Yes, you are correct in that US scans aren't the best for checking lymph nodes. They can see which ones are swollen but not really which position in the 'lymph drain chain' they are although they will know which one the sample was removed from by position recording on the biopsy scanner but this in itself will have no real relation to where along the line it is. With a SNB check a blue dye and a low dose radioactive tracer is injected near to the tumour and the flow is monitored. They use this to find which nodes take up the tracer. The nearest 2 or 3 nodes are those removed for testing. This is nearly always done at the time of breast surgery very rarely on it's own. So they may well wait until surgery before carrying out the snb check. In larger hospitals they can carry out the check while the patient is in theatre and if needed remove all in one go. If not the patient gets recalled and the removal if needed is carried out around a week later. Which can be tough undergoing two ops only a week or so apart. You can read more about SNB here. They can find the sentinel nodes either by tracking the isotope or looking for the blue dye. G n' J",

The ER8 means it is Oestrogen fed hence you needing the Tamoxifen to stop your oestrogen feeding any cells. The score of 8 is as high as the scale goes as far as I know. Grade 2 at 10mm is fairly good (well it could have been a lot worse anyway) and don't read too much into the invasive part as all breast cancers are or in the case of DCIS can become invasive. If after surgery you are upgraded to a 3 (which sometimes happens) and / or if it turns out you are HER2+ positive this is where the chemo comes in. Just have to keep your fingers crossed on that one. Good luck for your appointment Tuesday, and have a think over the weekend and make a note of any questions you may want to ask. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Rosiero,  Being HER2+ you will most probably be given Herceptin, these are mostly 18 sessions at three weekly intervals (one year) given either via an iv line through a cannula or the newer way is by subcutaneous injection but not all units are trained up to do this as yet. NICE only allows Herceptin to be used in conjunction with chemotherapy so this will undoubtably mean chemo too. You will have to confirm with your oncology team about this. The ER+ (oestrogen receptive) meaning after any other treatment including radiotherapy if you need that will be followed by five possibly ten years of oestrogen hormone inhibitor tablets. These could be Tamoxifen or Letrozole depending on if you are pre or post menopause. Treatment can be started as early as within one month post surgery providing you already know you don't have to go back for more surgery to get clear margins from the first lumpectomy.  This is how it was for Jackie who had a left mastectomy but was grade 3 ER/PR+ and HER2+ so could possibly be very similar treatment regime for you. When do you find out what they have planned for you ? G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya, The blue dye they use is a radio-nucleoid tracer posh techie name that means it is slightly radioactive so they can monitor where it flows / drains to after it is injected. It not only shows them blood flow in and around the cyst, tumour or whatever, it also shows if fluid from the lump is trying to reach or has reached the lymph nodes. From what they see determines how much of the lump they need to remove and hopefully get clear margins and also a guide to how many lymph nodes need removing to check out. This tissue goes to histology and it's them who figure out what it is grade / stage etc and if they need to get you in to take a bit more if it's found they didn't get clear margins and also check any lymph nodes for dodgy cells. The lymph node check is probably what is known as a SNB read about that here. Sentinel Node Biospy. They usually take around 4 (the nearest ones to the lump) - you can have up to thirty lymph nodes each side. Enjoy the weekend and try not to stress too much, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Daisy,  Sorry to read this is all still a bit up in the air at present but if you turn this on it's head it may help with what is going to happen next. If a patient gets surgery first and there is any lymph involvement they will perform a clearance to find out how many are actually affected and how far along the chain of nodes it has progressed. There can be up to 30 axilla nodes in some cases even more so without a full check it is difficult to say how many could be affected. Big question is what nodes did they FNA sample to establish they were positive. If they were close to the tumour it may be they have not travelled any further, if they were from distant nodes (doubtful as they usually check the nearest ones first) it could be more involved. In your mums case with chemo coming first reason being to shrink down or at the very least halt the growth her team will keep a close eye on her through chemo to check her tumours response to it and as it is a whole body treatment any lymphs affected will also get treated and checked. It all hinges on how she responds to the chemo as to the next move. Some are lucky enough to have massive shrinkage allowing a Lumpectomy (WLE) instead of mastectomy in either case they will probably carry out a SNB (sentinel node check) during surgery. If however at the half way stage she hasn't respond as well as everyone had hoped for, they may well perform surgery then (probably mastectomy and full axilla clearance ?) and continue with chemo and radiotherapy afterwards ? Have they mentioned which chemo regime they want to try her on as yet ? Sorry this hasn't really answered your question, it's very much a wait and watch situation. Might be a good idea to raise these questions with her team when you next meet them. If that seems a long way off, phone and get some information and questions answered. Take care and good luck for your mum with her prognosis. George & Jackie",

Those who have constant nausea find there is rarely any issue with sickness on T but are caught out by how different the effects are by comparison. Taxotere /  Docetaxel gives you a 3 day honeymoon period so sort of lulls you in then you wake up on day 4 feeling achey like when you have flu but this seems to affect both muscles and joints - Oral Thrush is also quite common with T as well   T can also reduce your white blood count more than FEC so do make sure you keep a regular check on your temp and contact the onco unit if it ever reaches the magic 37.5C figure in case you have picked up an infection. Do get involved with the July Chemo Club (link)  if you get any problems or have questions about it all - Most have already been there, done that and are happy to help. Please don't be put off by the huge list of side effects connected with T, most only are affected by three or so and there is always something you can take to ease these.

Because of your probs with antibio's do be careful regarding your temp as Jackie was admitted two weeks after her 1st FEC because of something as simple as oral thrush which quickly spiralled out of control her temp was 36.6 at night but had jumped to 37.8 by the morning. It meant a 4 day stay as an inpatient on antibio iv drips and tablets. When we phoned the unit and when they said come in straight away we panicked a bit, so it's ( not trying to worry you unduly here ) something they take very seriously when your white count is low while they find out what the cause of the infection is. Lots of us here have had to be admitted at some time, they reduced her chemo dose by 20% so it didn't knock out all her white cells next time around.

      "Content": "Afternoon Eddie,  That 65% probability for brca2 is a bit of a blow  - Suppose that DOES mean a 35% chance of a NO result too, so you have to hang onto that and keep everything crossed. Sooner you get the full picture the better, hopefully it will be negative so you won't have the unenviable task of informing your son and daughter and giving them the 50/50 worries too. The Royal Marsden published a 'Beginners Guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2'  Sharing information is on page 24 and the male brca section starts on page 29 It's all a bloody minefield, but you didn't need us to tell you that. Do hope it ends up all being a false alarm but as you say, it does need putting to bed for the sake of reassurance and eliminating future problems for you and your family. If you need any further info regarding BRCA testing it may be worth you using the free phone 0808 808 0000 Macmillan support line number for a bit of inside information from one of the cancer nurses. Do hope this is all a head game with no repercussions Eddie. Take care, George & Jackie (breast group)",

Everyone gets different experiences from the cold cap for some it works well for others not so great. Some give up after the first session finding it time consuming and too uncomfortable to tolerate. As you say hang on in there and see how it pans out for you. You may get some scalp pain longer hair is worse for this but it can be helped by a shorter cut (not so much weight pulling) Hope you don't get lose too much of it.... George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly, Know all this chemo malarky is pants and having an easier ride can make it seem a very long ride when you still feel fit enough to stay in control but there is a very good reason why the sessions are spaced out to this length like they are...... Chemo isn't just used to shrink tumours down, it is the main defence to smash any straggler cells that could be floating around elsewhere in the body. Most patients are unfortunately never told why chemo goes on for such an extended period - I just hope by putting this in here it doesn't cause anyone any concerns ? Chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells by attacking cells that are in the process of doubling to form two new cells. But not all the cells in a cancer will be dividing at the same time. Normal cells go into a long rest period between divisions. Cancer cells do too, although the rest period may be much shorter.  Giving chemotherapy in a series of treatments helps to catch as many cells dividing as possible and so kill them. Hopefully, cells that were resting when you had your first treatment (so didn't die) will be active when you have your next and so will be more likely to die. Multiply this by your number of sessions (usually six) and you can see why missing more than one session could mean you miss out. But it is unlikely that any cancer treatment will kill every single cancer cell in the body. Doctors try to reduce the numbers of cancer cells so much that the remaining cells will be killed off by the body's own defences. Or the cells may just die off naturally. That is why other complimentary treatments are offered too like Radiotherapy, possibly Herceptin (her2+)  Hormone Inhibitor tablets etc. This also partly explains why Triple Neg ladies are at a slightly higher risk as they will only get the surgery, chemo and rads :-( Hope this helps you understand why it drags on for so long but is a proven way of zapping the nasties. Take care, G n' J",

Yes, there is another fella who had a double mastectomy his member name is Russ-H his last post was about a month ago, so he is still around but doesn't post so often now. If you put his member name with the hyphen into the search this site box above his link should come up. Strangely enough Russ was same age as you (53) when diagnosed, but you haven't been yet and hopefully you won't be. Would be great to find it was just a cyst or benign lump but if your fears are confirmed understand BC is one of the most treatable types to have. You are at the moment what many would call the worst stage - Playing the waiting tests and results stage. It can really mess with your head if you let it. Know it's hard, but you have to try and find things to do, or places to go to take your mind off it all. Don't google random websites stick with reputable places like Macmillan, cancer research uk and breastcancercare uk  there is a lot of misleading very old information out there and treatment has come on leaps and bounds in even the last couple of years. If it is BC ? with your family having 'history' ask your GP about getting a BRCA-1/2 test done, it can take a month or two, so it pays to ask early on if you want one carried out. Reason for mentioning it is that if you do have gene issues it can be passed down to any children but if you are confirmed brca2 it can carry a higher risk of prostate cancer in a similar way to women with brca can have ovary problems. Not trying to worry you even more, just letting you know :-/ There is a Macmillan booklet 'Understanding Breast Cancer in Men' I've put the link in so you can read up on the testing / diagnosing sections- don't bother reading any further in as none of it may end up applying to you - nice thought, that one :-) Here's another link to BRCA1/2 in Men if that may also help you figure out whether to get the test done later on. Hope this helps a bit, very best of good luck waiting results. George & Jackie",

Jackie felt she could have gone back to work a bit earlier but seeing as she works with some pt's who have mrsa and the ever present risk or norovirus etc her Dr kept her off. She has only just returned on half shifts ( which they were fine with ) after being off work since late May. Other areas like working in schools or other places where bugs are more likely to be present will def be a risk whilst on chemo, same with any type of post op manual work, but if you are just on hormone tabs or herceptin could be do-able if you feel up to it. Finances can be a problem, it's a large drop from a salary to stat sick pay and any annual leave will soon evaporate. If you can manage on SSP for a while have a word with your Dr and get a few more weeks off to fully recover.

If you are being offered a PICC hug the person offering one and say 'YES PLEASE' !!! Only takes around 30 mins or so to fit using a 'local' bit of discomfort for around 24-36 hours while it settles and gives you 18 weeks of freedom from all the other chemo hassles. There are few who have had a slight infection at the picc entry site but this is uncommon. Take care, G n' J",

Anything that could have helped with this is preventative and done at the time - It's a case of it's in there and what will be will be. Some chemo units have cooling gloves and bootees that work in a similar way to the cold cap but this is fairly new technology and not many units have them as yet. J had PN affecting her feet and hands post T they gradually recovered but it took quite a while. Both her big toes are still a bit numb and her chemo ended around Oct 2012 :( I would mention it though as they may be able to tell you exactly what they think it is (PN or not) and have some advice about making things easier to cope with.  G n' J",

It may be a combination of starting Tamoxifen on top of all the treatments you have already been through that has pushed you into fatigue rather than just feeling tired :-( Sometimes the make of tamoxifen you are given just doesn't suit you, there are several 'brands' so a different one may be better for you. Can you mention which make you are taking at the moment to see if anyone else has had similar problems with it and found a brand which they found better  ? There is more advice about tiredness and fatigue here, you could also ask your GP about a blood test to see if you are a bit anaemic or lacking in some vitamin or other ? Maybe it's your bodies way of telling you you need to stay in third gear for a while longer to let your body recover some more - so many here hit that 'wall' trying to do too much too soon ?

There are loads of messages on breast cancer forums from those seeking advice about it - whether it's tinnitus, vertigo etc It's good you are being referred for an MRI to hopefully rule out anything nasty but from what I have read the chances are this is Anastrozole related are quite high. If this does seem to be anastaozole related maybe switching to another type of Ai like letrozole or exemestane would fix it, but would then possibly give you different side effects :( You can check out a whole shedload of posts about Tinnitus (183) at BreastCancer.Org in their 'Hormonal Therapy During and After' discussion page. Don't know if you have had an MRI before but the are a bit claustrophobic and very noisy. Great to read apart from the tinnitus you are getting on well with your 'new normal' Has your brand of anastrozole changed and could that be a reason this has now started or is it something you have always mildly suffered with on and off but now seems more permanent ?

You take a fair battering as you constantly switch from one lot of treatment to another and your body doesn't get time to fully recover from any of them. The tiredness thing will carry on for a good 2 - 3 weeks after rads too - only thing you can do is rest when your body tells you it's had enough and during times when you feel a bit brighter go for a short walk if only window shopping round the stores or maybe to a park or somewhere a bit more peaceful and serene if you prefer. As long as you get a little exercise to stop you seizing up all together. If it seems to be gradually getting worse have a word with your GP about getting a blood test done to see if you are a tad anaemic especially if you are not eating healthily because of treatment. You know what's coming next don'cha 'Coping With Fatigue'  yes a Maccy booklet I'm afraid - LOL Well it's there if you want to check it out :)  Don't expect too much of yourself for a while it may only take a few minutes getting zapped but it stays working within you 24/7 Get the rads out the way and then set your alarm clock for quarter past Spring and you'll be fine.

The only hot drink J could get any flavour from was Galaxy drinking chocolate. As for food it mostly goes one of two ways - Some prefer bland food like porridge, toast, crackers, baked potato meals, milky puddings etc and the other half find they now prefer spicy foods to enjoy any flavour at all. We lived on curries, chilli bakes and saucy pasta based dishes for around six months. Sometimes you can play the small portion on a small plate trick so the look of a piled up plateful of food doesn't put you off. As long as you are having a mix of fresh fruit and veg and eating little but often you'll be fine. It just takes a bit of experimenting to find what you prefer. You could try looking here for some ideas and recipes. Take care, G n' J",

Having two nodes affected from three means the lymph nodes were doing their job which is to trap infectious cells and stop them from going elsewhere within your body - We have read here of ladies with far more nodes affected than that (15 maybe more) who have gone on and kicked cancers ar*e so please don't see this as a death sentence - far from it. BC has a 90% recovery rate. Ok so they now recommend chemo, but you may have been offered this anyway depending on what the histology results were. Things often change when the surgery tissue samples have been looked at and well over half of ladies get put on chemo as insurance to help stop any re-occurance. Please reply with any questions or concerns you have, you certainly sound very shell shocked and we all want to help you through this. Group Hugs, G n' J",

Heather77 took Letrozole for a year prior to surgery and Chloecat45 is taking Anastrozole (very similar drug) as her only treatment so yes, they work :) Other cancer types also found to be ER+ positive (of which there are several) can also be treated with Letrozole type drugs or Tamoxifen if pre meno. Letrozole is considered the better one long term but all AI's (aromatase inhibitors) have these bone/joint aches as a side effect. The Herceptin can also cause aches in legs, knees etc so perhaps you are getting a double whammy at the moment :( Take care, G n' J",

If so you may be given your HER2 results and confirmation of which chemotherapy drugs you will be given. They will weigh and measure you as the dosage levels are calculated by your BMI. If you haven't one as yet you could be given a CT scan and/or ECG heart trace. These are just to confirm you are fit enough for chemo and there are no surprises like finding you only have one kidney or any other organ damage etc. Probably a blood test to get base levels of things like red and white cell counts liver enzyme levels, although this may be carried out a day or two before your first session. This is where you could ask about using scalp cooling (cold cap) if you fancy trying that option to save some of your hair and you can also ask if they fit a PICC line or some form of intravenous line for administering chemo and taking blood tests. Some health authority area do this as standard, some don't. If you get offered one seriously think about accepting it, they make sessions far more do'able :) G n' J",

A lot of patients find this level a tad too high but either don't mention how tough they are finding it, or don't even realise a dose reduction is do'able. There are quite a few who have their chemo dosage reduced and the most common figure is a reduction of 20% J is HER2+ and had her last Docetaxel lowered by 20% five years ago, so reducing is a known way of helping you through this. Oh, and do ask your consultant  to    speak    more   slowly   so  you   can   understand   what   they   are   saying  :)) Hope the 10% takes the edge off the side effects, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi  Chris,  Re - DCIS, the Ductal part means it's found in the milk ducts and the \"in situ\" means it is localised in this place, it doesn't travel so is non invasive. It is common this type localised doesn't need chemo, if they are certain they have got it all with clear margins, but other factors may mean that chemo is also used. Was the first lumpectomy not for dcis then ? In Jackie's case her BC was DCIS 8m/m just behind the nipple, but it was also found to be HER2 hormone receptor positive so this meant she had to be given Herceptin but in order to get Herceptin she also had to have Docetaxel chemo but she is ER+ (oestrogen receptor ) positive as well. So for her she got the full monty mastectomy, FEC then Docetaxel chemo, Herceptin and radiotherapy.   A receptor is basically like an on / off switch which switches on the cancer cell growth if the hormone it it positive for is found in cells in your bloodstream  i.e. oestrogen or progesterone etc. The oncology drugs given target these receptors and either switches them off permanently, or by reducing your hormone level stops the cancer cells from developing further and in a lot of cases actually shrinking them by cutting blocking off it's receptors or starving it. Yours were found at a very early stage so that is great, have you had any info yet regarding the HER hormone receptor status yet or they just told you about being ER+ ? This will determine more than anything how your treatment plan will work out. We are 14 months past diagnosis / surgery now with only 2 Herceptin to go and continuation of her 5 years worth of Letrozole. They are not unduly worried about BC occuring in her other breast but obviously keep a close on things with regular mammograms and scans. Assume your sentinel nodes check must have been given the \"all clear\" ? They are a great bunch on here,  best thing we ever did was joining up to Maccyland  :-)  Keep us informed as to where you go from here, as for the train ride bit,  well expect to be derailed a couple of times along the way, but it's all so do'able and the time soon goes. Kindest Wishes and very good luck,  George & Jackie.  ",

Femara are supposedly the best as they were the original brand before Letrozole became unlicensed and could be made by other companies. Jackie was given two months of Femara by the onco unit, however when she picked up her repeat from our local pharmacy she was given Teva brand and these increased her joint pain and caused a few other issues. After trying two other types her GP altered her repeat from Letrozole to Femara so these are the only ones she gets now. These suit her but all letrozole will cause bone / joint pain to a certain extent, it's because of the lack of oestrogen which causes bone thinning and osteopaenia problems. If this is still a problem you can get NSAID's (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) to ease the joint pains and Adcal+ and vitamin D3 to add calcium which helps with the bone thinning. Have you had Muga scans to check your bone density ? Hope this helps a bit, G n' J",

      "Content": "Evening Maggie, This is a toughie to get your head around as there is so much involved as with any treatment plan - a lot more stats are gathered than the info given if you ask for your path report. They could have given you chemo first to shrink them but the chances are with two multi focal you would have had to go back after a WLE and either had a lot more removed to get clear margins or the given mastectomy anyway. I reckon they gave you the mastectomy first so they could check the tissue for HER2 and gather more info from the tumours to work out the best treatment plan for you. Jackie had just one 8mm tumour behind and attached to the nipple and was given an MX before chemo. No option to try and shrink it and we never questioned that decision at the time or now. Think you just accept that given the information they have obtained and using their expertise and experience you trust they make the right choice of treatment on your behalf. It may seem drastic but I think most would rather have the kitchen sink thrown at it knowing everything possible was being done to avoid any re-occurance than leaving a chink in the armour that comes back and bites you at a later date. The EC over FEC chemo plan could be down to a number of things. Oncologists preference, some medical reason why Fluorouracil wouldn't have been suitable for you. It could be they wanted to give you higher doses of E and C so adding the Fluorouracil would have been too much for you. EC or FEC for that matter can affect the heart more than Docetaxel, that is why Herceptin isn't given at the same time as either of those. Only after those chemos or in conjunction with Docetaxel. So maybe the EC regime you were on was to protect your heart for some reason. There maybe even some stats which are unknown to you that played a role in the decision only way to find out for certain would be to contact your onco and ask for the reasons behind it. Sorry it's a bit of a long non answer, just a few suggestions, but hope it helps in some way. Take care, G n' J",

Welcome to Mr.T's  'How to make your joints and bones age 20 years overnight' club :-( Jackie always called Docetaxel FEC's ugly sister. If the pain gets really bad you can alternate paracetamol and any other non paracetamol containing tablets like Ibuprofen so you take something every two hours if that doesn't ease it ask for some better pain relief and also ask about the chances of having the dosage reduced by 20% for your other sessions - if it is mostly bearable just try to work through it day by day if you can. The lack of sleep at first is mostly down to the steroids and the aches disturbing your sleep don't worry about that you'll soon be crashing on the sofa by around 2pm (or earlier)  Do please use any mouthwash you have - even if you don't feel you need it at the moment because if you do start getting a sore mouth it will be too late to stop it getting a little worse. The steroids kill off the good bacteria in your mouth and throat which normally keeps your mouth healthy. Mouth ulcers and oral thrush are what you are trying to avoid. This docetaxel can really knock the stuffing out of you so dig deep and hang tough and it will pass day by day. Plan a little special treat for yourself as a reward during the week (days 14 - 21) before your next session when almost overnight it will feel like a brick wall has been lifted off you. Hope you feel a little better this morning but it's probably a bit early for that yet. We feel your hit by a truck pain Ro - G n' J",

I haven't heard of Niche Generics producing Letrozole  and had a look at their product list and Letrozole isn't mentioned. So I think that they possibly only recently got the license to produce them ? Several people have mentioned problems getting Accord brand recently but it seems to vary in different parts of the country ? Good luck with them, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning  Trudi, Sorry to see another new member of the club no-one wants to join.  Right first off, take a few deep breaths and slow yourself down a tad. You are understandably worried and wanting answers to so'ooo many questions you'll blow a fuse at this rate  :-)    Sounds to us like you haven't had much time to soak up all the results info as yet and are still in shock. So, after reading your messages, lets see if we can figure this out. Are you going to get TAC or FEC ? before your mastectomy, then Tax with Herceptin after the op ? Bit confused here as to which one they are giving you first, could you clarify please ? They can all effect you in different ways. Did they mention wether it's DCIS or Lobular as we have no idea about FE2 ? The lumps under your arm are probably the lymph glands reacting to the cancer. Were those biopsies taken from just under your arm or the breast ( maybe both )  ? Sorry to be shooting so many Q's at you but it gives us a better chance to help you if we know a bit more about it  :-) I'll paste a couple of links in that may help you get your head around it all,  there is so'oo much to try and get your head around at the start, it's hard trying to take it all in. Meanwhile, take one day at a time, walk don't run, you have come to the right place and will find loads of friends here who have been there, done that and will guide you and others new members who will share their treatment with you. For info on TAC or FEC (combo chemo's ) note make sure you know which one these they are giving you, because TAC is different to Tax - which is short for Taxotere / Docetaxel and just to confuse things even further there is also the FEC you mention  :-) The first link is for TAC (combo chemo ) http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Combinationregimen/TAC.aspx For info on just Taxotere  http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Docetaxel.aspx Understanding your results booklet - http://www2.breastcancercare.org.uk/sites/default/files/bcc161_understanding_your_pathology_report.pdf This link is for FEC (combo chemo ) http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Combinationregimen/FEC.aspx Take care,  George & Jackie.",

      "Content": "Hi Aneesa1   A lot of people associate grade with size but although that is taken into consideration it's not the whole picture. It's also about how aggressive the cells appear. J's tumour was only 8mm and she had no lymph involvement but was also classed as grade 3 we were told that was because of the HER2+ positive finding bumping up the ladder from a grade 2. Although hearing a grade 3 is more aggressive can be a bit scary, the Herceptin this finding qualifies you for is a game changing treatment for HER2+ cancers. Your wig lady was bang out of order - Totally agree with Londonlass's comment. What she could have told you is that Herceptin is brilliant at avoiding HER2+ becoming a secondary cancer later on, but I'm wondering if she even knows the difference between secondary and recurrence :-? I remember reading a comment on here years ago saying when you get a cancer diagnosis there were 2 types of friends - Drains and Radiators. Those who mentally drain you, and those who radiate warmth and keep you cosy. \"Ditch the drains, and surround yourself with Radiators\" Take care, G n' J",

The info link above will be of use for anyone else querying the trial. Stopping HRT and starting Letrozole will make your body feel like it is dealing with a double whammy as you are not only losing the hrt hormones, the letrozole will stop you producing Oestrogen. So do be prepared for some menopausal symptoms to kick in at some time - hot flashes and some bone/joint aches  :(  Have you had a Dexa Bone Density scan yet - You should have one if you are on Letrozole long term as they can cause bone thinning ? If you start getting issues do post a new discussion to the breast group there are plenty of ladies on Letrozole who can offer you some advice about easing any of the side effects. You should get some idea on how they will be affecting you after 2-4 weeks as they get into your system. There are also a few here who have been placed on letrozole to shrink tumours prior to surgery too (neo-adjuvant hormone therapy) Take care, G n' J",

Calcifications themselves are fairly common and are mostly benign, however if these calcifications form a cluster it could be a sign of it being a pre-cancerous condition which will need further tests to get a conclusive answer - Hence the biopsy and scans etc, especially with the added symptom of a lymph node being enlarged, which mostly only happens when something upsets them like when they swell up if you get flu or mumps. There is more information about Calcification here (link) you can read through. Fingers crossed for good results from the barrage of tests she is having, do keep asking questions here, you probably have loads. Take care and good luck, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Cheri, Not long got home from work so couldn't reply earlier. This finger and/or toe pain from Docetaxel affects some people more than others and if you are getting this now it could be that your dosage levels have been set a tad too high - In cases like this it is important you give your Onco unit a ring and explain what is going on and they may well reduce your others sessions by 20% or could change you to the milder weekly Paclitaxel version of Tax type chemo or replace the Taxane type chemo for something else.  PN needs taking seriously and keeping an eye on as the pain can get worse before it gets better. Especially if your hands or feet start feeling hot and burning like pain as this can lead to Palmar Plantar (hand and foot syndrome) which really is debilitating as the skin can get blistered and crack open. Normally it takes a while for signs of this particular side effect to appear (can even happen post chemo) as it takes a while to travel along to the end of the long nerves in your legs and arms. Obviously this has happened a lot quicker in your case :( Unfortunately unless your unit has the new type 'cooling gloves and / or boots' similar to the cold cap if you are prone to this there isn't anything they can actually give you to stop this happening apart from what's mentioned above. Do have a read of this Macmillan info page on Peripheral Neuropathy (it's an vastly updated version of the old one mentioned in the previous reply) As for the rash, this is quite common and some have found an anti-histamine like Piriton helps but do mention this as well because they may be able to supply you with something better to help clear it up. Hope this is of some help, take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, Peripheral Neuropathy unfortunately comes in many flavours very minor nerve damage can be slight numbness and pins and needles but it can get so painful you can hardly walk and climbing hills and stairs are like a form of torture. Use the link to read more about what you can do to help with this, and you are correct Docetaxel and other chemo types are the biggest culprit for this. At least see your GP or onco unit and get some NSAID's - Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as nothing much else will help with nerve damage pain.  Please keep a close eye on your hands and feet as the skin could become blistered or broken and feel like they are burning - Which is a type of PN called Palmar Plantar or hand and foot syndrome. Jackie didn't get the PN pain but did lose all 20 nails over a period of 3 months post Tax. You can get some cream to help which is the same stuff dairy farmers use on cattle teets to avoid cracking and mastitis called Udder Cream, you can get it from Amazon but also from country stores and may even be able to get it through your GP on prescription. Hope this helps, suffering with this is awful :-( G n' J",

Been over three weeks now and it's taken nearly all that time to get over it - and I'm still a bit sinussy (is that a word)  :-) It's an evil bug Yvonne but it does clear up although very slowly.

I think there can be some muscle weakness in the back and shoulder and nerve issues with this type of recon but have no idea if this is common or not. Sorry to not be of more help with this but Jackie never went the recon route so had no reason to weigh up the pro's and con's. mistymoley would have more knowledge of recon types. no doubt Helen will reply shortly.

A banana a day would help top up your potassium and you could buy Magnesuim supplement tablets. Maybe try each one in turn to see if any of these remedies help. May be worth checking this out with your GP ? as diabetes and thyroid problems can cause cramps too. Take care, and lovely to read you are about to reach the end of that long haul treatment plan.

Jackie had a Groshong line in but they said lines can't be used. Maybe it's because of the radioactivity ? They can if trained take the blood from your line, but it never goes back in that way, it has to be a vein. They are radiologists not medical folks... They take a little blood, you go for a coffee, come back in half an hour during which time they have mixed your blood with the 'glow in the dark' stuff and they inject it back into you and then it's 20 mins on the scanner. Is this tied in with having Herceptin or they checking to see if chemo has affected your heart ? This Muga leaflet is from Derby Hosp. G n' J",

This is the link to NHS P.A.L.S (patient advice and liaison service) information page - you can find your nearest pals office from the search within that page. Do check it out at the very least you deserve some answers. I'm surprised the original chemo didn't have more of an effect of this lymph node :( Hope you get something positive from them but can totally understand there are days when you have limited energy to take these issues on.

Some folks liver are not so efficient at processing the chemo tho', so may take a few days longer. Thats why they take bloods a few days before each session - to check liver enzymes etc and your daily temp checks help you to see if it's going Pete Tong. As a rule of thumb it's sort of - Week 1 makes you feel like crap - Week 2 you can catch any type of crap and - Week 3 you are feeling better just in time to accept the next lot of crap.  Ok it's not all that bad, just be cautious but not overly so during the 2nd week. Snotty schoolkids and dr's waiting rooms are germ factories. Normal personal hygiene to be considered as \"you\" are the biggest threat to yourself as we all carry loads of bugs around with us too. Remember cancer is a word, not a sentence, so don't let it make you a prisoner.  Cheer's to another chemo date box ticked off.  Hugs, G  n'  J",

Can give you a little background info though :-) The original registered make of Tamoxifen and probably the most expensive is Nolvadex (astra zeneca) all the other brands are generic so although they contain the same drug the fillers used to make up the balance and the tablet coating (e-numbers for colouring etc) may be different and it is these that can cause some issues as well as the drug itself. The more common 'brands' in the uk are - Arrow,  Bayer,  Mylan,  Orion,  Novartis,  Merck,  Sandoz,  Schering,  Teva and  Wokhardt. You may get lucky and find the first one suits you, but if it does cause random problems you may have to get them to switch a few brands around until you find the best one for you :-( Hopefully you will get lots more replies with recommendations and can find which brands 'seem to be better'  I think the general consensus is if Tamoxifen causes you night sweats or other overnight problems taking it in the morning could be a better option ? but I'm uncertain about this..... ?

J, my better half was diagnosed way back in May 2012 and also has a left mastectomy followed by chemo and radiotherapy, the treatments work and she is still classed as having no evidence of disease. No doubt you will get a more detailed report from the biopsies and also tissue pathology examination post surgery but the recovery rate from breast cancer is very high (over 90%) contrary to what you see and read in the media.

Some get neuropathy pain during chemo and the dose can be tweaked to a lower level to minimise it, like yours was, or help it from getting worse. This can also ease right off when chemo is completed over an 8 week period. Others find they don't start getting neuropathy pain until the chemo has already ended (can be 3-6 months later) others don't get any at all - it's all very individual. For an unlucky few they suffer some permanent residual chemo induced neuropathy and there are several ladies here who are a couple of years post chemo who still have slightly numb feet / toes - fingers / hands :( I'm afraid it's a case of carry on with your reduced dose and hope for the best, or take the risk of not having the remaining 2 x Paclitaxel - How many Paclitaxel have you already had ?

      "Content": "Morning JJ, As Helen mentioned it is quite common to be moved up a stage after the tissue is examined in the pathology unit as they get a much better view of it compared to the small biopsy samples. Sorry to read you have been called back for more tissue to be taken, did you get any results regarding your sentinel nodes being clear ? because if some are affected they may remove some more of those as well :-( If you haven't been given much information about triple negative you can read about it here at BCC. A CT scan check is common practice before starting chemo to see if there are any previously unfound problems which the chemo may have an affect on (heart, liver, kidneys etc) There is a Triple Negative Breast Group but because TNBC isn't that common (around 15%) the group is not very active but you could have a look at the posts and replies there. I don't want to add further worries to you but a lot of TNBC ladies end up with a mastectomy because there is a slightly higher possibility of recurrence over the first 3 years with TN. Both you and they will want to do all they can to try and avoid this. TN mostly responds very well to chemo. There are quite a few triple negative ladies here, hopefully some will reply to this to help advise you. Take care, G n' J",

It's terrible to be put in this position when you know so little about what it's all about and what the future may hold. They all seem to think you know a much about it all as they do. Seen quite a few very similar posts recently and it is a tough choice. They can enter your diagnosis results into a \"predict tool' and give you percentages of recurrance which with a stage 2 and no lymph involvement is usually fairly low % The problem is if you declined chemotherapy and went with rads only you will probably spend the rest of your life wondering if you did enough to avoid it coming back at sometime or whether you should have chucked everything including the kitchen sink at it knowing you did everything you could to give you the best possible outcome. Most would say go for it and accept the chemo too, but it is your choice - having chemo can be a tough 4 months and even the thought of saying yes to that is scary but it is do'able. It all depends on the type of person you are, minimum treatment and a quicker recovery time now and risk it later, or accept everything going and still have no solid guarantees just the security of  'I did all I could' Don't envy you with this head game but good luck with whatever you decide is best for you.

If that makes no dif, it could be a s/e of the EC.Think the fact it seems to start when you stop taking them is a coincidence maybe it takes a few days to get into your system.

Seems from results of some recent published tests carried out in the USA Radiotherapy appears to be more effective if any stray cancer cells are active, Tamoxifen can make them a bit docile as it is cutting off a big part of their food supply (oestrogen) but most of this is speculation at the moment. Where the problem is is that some oncologists now follow this view and delay Tamoxifen and / or other hormone inhibitor tablets until after radiotherapy just in case this is proven through trials. Other oncologists are prepared to wait until all the evidence is in and will still get you on the tablets soon as possible. Result there is a variation in treatment depending on who your onco is and their views on this ? I may be wrong but that's what I can gather from it all, G n' J",

With your ER & PR score at 8's they may well keep you on the Zoladex as well as introducing the Tamoxifen - So you must still be pre-menopausal ? Quite a few nodes are found to carry micromets - depending on the size they will either remoove more or all nodes to check the lot, or if minor they will leave them and use chemo and rads to zap them. I think Micromets are classed as anything from 0.2 to under 2mm over that they become classed as macromets. They are basically talking about groups of cells rather than actual tumours - hence node negative (it's a bit of a grey area)  The H&E part is Hematoxylin which stains cell nuclei blue/black and Eosin stains protein and cell cytoplasm deep pink. When used together, hematoxylin and eosin is termed \u2018H&E.\u2019 With micromets they sometimes give a more concentrated (boost) of rads or concentrate more on the axilla area than they would if the nodes were clear. Another way is to give an axilla 'boost' dose on the last day of rads - Has anything been mentioned about this to you ? I'm sat tapping away thinking I'm preaching to the already converted here  LOL You mention loads more questions, so fire away. We're all here to help :-) Any other ladies here had micromets and could chip in ? Take care, G n' J",

Can't really comment about the Herceptin injections as back in 2012 when Jackie had her 18 x Herceptin it was given like chemo using a bag and pump through a line. Herceptin can weaken the heart muscles but this is very closely monitored using regular Muga scans and this happens you get given a short treatment break allowing recovery if this occurs. 4 years on and still no evidence of disease, I would say Herceptin is a major game changer.

Re the thickening thing - Not all breast cancers are lumps in which case thickening can be a symptom but don't read too much into that on it's own ? A lot of women have breasts that aren't an even, soft, spongy texture all over, so if you find things are firmer in one area more than normal, or more firm in one side compared to the other it is worth getting this checked out.  What to look out for are when things feel or look different to how they normally are for you.  That is why regular 'cop-a-feel' (breast and underarm tail) sessions with soapy hands in the shower are important, so you get to know what feels normal and can notice any changes sooner.

The rads keep working for up to two weeks after your sessions end and it can feel a bit like light sunburn but nothing too bad. It is very uncommon for anyone to get long term side effects from rads, just use plenty of the cream they should give you, if they don't supply any you may have to buy a tub but it's not expensive. You can get some info from having a read of this 'Radiotherapy For Primary Breast Cancer' (link) which covers the assessment appointment too where you get to ask any questions and see what goes on. You also get some very tiny black dot tattoo's which they use to line the machine up with each session so you don't have to be messed about being aligned every time. What fears do you have about radiotherapy  ? Hope this is of some help, Rads are so do'able, honestly :-) Take care, G n' J",

Welcome to the Mac Community, although it probably the last place you thought you would be signing up to :( You are entering a very stressy and emotional time - everyone hated the waiting results period it seems to drag on forever. You get the 2 weeks between GP and breast clinic then another (in most cases) 10-14 days wait for results from any mammogram /and/or ultrasound scans or biopsies if taken :( It is going to be hard carrying on as normal without your savvy pair noticing something not being right ? They will pick on 'stuff' so have a reason handy if needed - if you feel a bit teary at times the shower is a good place to get soap in your eyes... You are right about keeping quiet for now, at least until you know for sure what this is and what is happening as questions will be asked if you bring this up and you as yet don't even have any answers yourself. Fingers crossed whatever this is it is benign, benign may still require surgery as they grow as well, however if your fears are confirmed treatment can and does start quite soon after the results are back (within a month normally) Noticed you actually joined this very active group (good move) we're a friendly bunch who will help support you - hopefully yours will be a short stay.

      "Content": "Hi Mira Mirabo  They recommend you don't use anything that is either too hot or cold during breast rads. This list of precautions is taken from the Sloan Kettering US website. Avoid irritating your skin in the area being treated Wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and undergarments in the area being treated. Avoid tight clothing that will rub up against your skin, including underwire bras for women. Use only the moisturizers, creams, or lotions that you have discussed with your radiation oncologist or nurse. Don\u2019t use makeup, perfumes, powders, or aftershave in the area being treated. Don\u2019t put tape on your treated skin If your skin is itchy, don\u2019t scratch it. Apply moisturizer. Ask your nurse for recommendations on how to relieve the itching. Don\u2019t shave in the area that\u2019s being treated. If you must shave, use only an electric razor. Stop if your skin becomes irritated. Don\u2019t let your treated skin come into contact with extreme hot or cold temperatures. This includes hot tubs, water bottles, heating pads, and ice packs. If you don\u2019t have any skin reactions during your treatment, you can swim in a chlorinated pool. However, be sure to rinse off the chlorine right after getting out of the pool. Avoid tanning or burning your skin during treatment and for the rest of your life. If you\u2019re going to be in the sun, use a PABA-free sunblock with an SPF of 30 or higher. Also, wear loose-fitting clothing that covers you as much as possible. Hope this is of some help, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Mini11  One question you should ask (especially if you are one who has finding a vein hassle having bloods taken) is if they fit a PICC line or Port-a-Cath  prior to chemotherapy - Has this been mentioned to you ? Some health authority areas do this as standard others only fit one if the chemo nurses have problems at your first session, but by then you will have already had one session and any vein damage (if you are going to be prone to it) will have already started. These stay in all the way through your sessions but PICC's do need a 5 minute flush weekly to avoid them getting blocked with congealed blood. I think the Port versions have a monthly flush  but uncertain as J had a Groshong iv line in her chest. They only take around 30-40 mins to fit under a local and save loads of needles, eliminates the risk of chemo leak and makes the sessions quicker which is a bonus. Very few have issues from a line of some sort; they are also used for the many blood samples taken during the 18 weeks or so. There is extensive info about ways to give chemo here (link) You could ask about scalp cooling if you want to try minimising hair loss (although you could still lose 50%) and if so which system they use as not all have the Paxman cooling systems. Sure you will get more tips on what to ask. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Morecombe, There is a very active chemo discussion titled May Chemo Club (link) here. The link will send you to the first page but it already has lots of posts. It has carried on from the April Thread so some have already had a couple of sessions and can offer friendly advise and tips. Inflammatory is a quite rare (only around 4%) and as Helen says the treatment can differ slightly. IBC will always mean chemo before surgery but a lot of the ladies here also have that to shrink tumours down first. Surgery should follow on within 4 weeks of chemo finishing and Radiotherapy within 4 weeks of having surgery because IBC is classed as fast growing and mostly there is no tumour (lump) which can make detecting this type taking longer to diagnose. Did you read the 'IBC-What Is It ?' post in the IBC group ? there is a 'secret' facebook group if you are into FB ?  There is also this booklet about IBC from breastcancercare.uk if you haven't been given a copy. Hope this helps you settle in a bit, facing chemo can see a bit scary, but your first session is always more scary in your head than in reality. Are you having the FEC part first, or the T (Taxotere aka Docetexel part first ? Just wanted to add, don't know if you have heard of this but there is a 'Cold Cap' you can wear during chemo which can save some hair but unless it is a very good fit most suffer some hair loss. There is more information about Scalp Cooling here. It is a bit hit and miss, for some it works well others either give up because of all the hassle or would rather be without than be patchy. It also adds a fair bit of time to each session Take care, G n' J",

Don't know if this is anywhere near the area where your tumour was removed from but it may be scar tissue forming and affecting the nipple nerves and also from the armpit if you had any lymph nodes removed. Either way I would contact your breast care nurse and get it all checked out, they may arrange to ultrasound scan you to see if it is scar tissue, but you need to get some answers to this to ease any worries.

      "Content": "Hi Fiona, Welcome to the group, a great place to find at a tough time. Sorry to read you are having another anxious waiting results session for your pathology report, it really is a tough time :( There are several Triple Neg ladies here who will no doubt say Hi! as soon as they read your message. How long past surgery are you, it sounds quite recent - If you have any questions regarding recovery or healing worries, do ask, the help here is amazing. It isn't unusual to have some cells found in the lymph nodes it is the most likely place they get trapped and this is supposed to happen, so at least your lymph nodes did their job containing them. How are your boys taking the news and have you told them a little about what is happening but waiting until you know more about it yourself or tried being more open about it all to your older son ? As for the chemo it depends on which chemo regime they place you on as there are several differing options. For the most part they are at 3 weekly intervals and can be 6 (in some cases 8) cycles - so it does tend to go on for a while - and has it's ups and downs but is do'able. BTW - You can find the November Chemo Club Helen mentioned clicking the green text link. Don't get alarmed by some of the posts, as everyone gets a different ride and most only ask questions when they have a problem that needs advice so it can seem a bit unnerving. Take care and good luck with healing well and getting those results. G n' J",

Whether changing from Taxotere to Taxol will alter this usual pattern I'm uncertain but it probably won't and your wife will find the hair keeps growing. The new hair may be very fine and may start becoming curly as it gets longer but is quite slow growing. The lady garden and other hair will also start coming through. Some find the facial fluff a bit alarming but that doesn't mean they are turning into 'Chewbacca'  it usually falls out after a couple of weeks. The weekly chemo is Taxol also known as Paclitaxel and is a lower dose version of the 3 weekly Taxotere / Docetaxel and the side effects from this are the same as for docetaxel, but are usually a lot more do'able. It is the E (epirubicin / red) part of EC which is the hair zapper and some chemo drugs are worse for hair loss than others. Nice to see that for you two the end of chemo is in sight.

Ginger Nut and Arrowroot biscuits to help with any nausea and taste issues and if you haven't got a PICC line fitted one of those microwaveable lavender wheat wraps (Tesco or Amazon etc) to help with any vein aches.

      "Content": "Hi Jump123  This is something you need to contact the Radiology department about - so first off find out where the rads unit you will be having your radiotherapy is at and give them a ring - Perhaps they could offer you an appointment  well in advance to chat about the risks of keloid scarring from the radiotherapy and what they could do to minimize this ? I'm uncertain if this is the same type of treatment but it seems radiotherapy is actually used to treat keloid scars, so hopefully this won't be a much of a problem as you are thinking. I would definitely check this out in advance and get informed answers to your keloid risk questions though. When you have enough information about the risks you can make an informed decision. At least you have plenty of time to gather some facts together. I'm assuming you are having chemo before surgery so you will be having a lumpectomy (WLE) and not a mastectomy ?  I'm just wondering about the risk of keloid scars from the surgery ?

We can understand your chemo concerns and worries, but all it takes is for a few rogue cells to by pass the lymph system and they could show up elsewhere later in lungs, bone, liver etc. No chemo treatments are the same, some suffer several side effects, some get an easier ride. Think of chemo as an insurance on you and your families future. I'd prefer to have those cells jumped on by chemo and obliterated, rather relying on localised radiotherapy and hormone tabs to fend it off.  I hope you get a reply or two about saying no and explaining why that route was chosen, but I think a vast majority would advise you to take the bull by the horns and kick C's arse. It can be scary, but once treatment starts the time goes so quickly and your soon out the other end a bit wobbly and bruised but looking towards a brighter future knowing you did all you could to stay safe. Hope this helps,  George and Jackie.",

So pleased to read you convinced your daughter to get a GP appt. You don't need us to tell you this is the start of an agonising waiting results period for all of you. A lot of breast lumps (even growing ones) turn out to be benign fatty tumours or cysts, hopefully this will be the case for your daughter too. Fingers crossed and hope for the best. Heaven forbid this is isolating enough without trying to cope while being deaf as well :-( If you haven't found it already Macmillan has the 'Understanding Your Breast Clinic Appointment' booklet which covers everything from mammogram screening results and further tests if required. This one from Breast Cancer Care deals mostly with those referred to a breast unit from a GP appointment, so may be more appropriate. Don't fret about being a fella here, these lovely ladies have tolerated me for nearly three years now. If you need any more advice or support, or have some unanswered questions just holler. This is a very active group and there is always someone around to reply. Best wishes for some good luck, George & Jackie",

J was so knocked about by her treatment she tried going back to work on a staged return but found it was still too much both mentally and physically so finished working at 59 She did have some anti-side effect tablets to counter the Letrozole aches (Meloxicam and Amytriptyline) and has weaned herself off these since finishing her 5 years on them. Having a tube of Smarties weekly is a pain but if it helps lower the risk of recurrence it is a small price to pay.

The system looks at what percentage of cells test positive for hormone er and pr receptors, along with how well the receptors show up after staining (this is called \u201cintensity\u201d). This information is then combined to score the sample on a scale from 0 to 8. The higher the score, the more receptors were found and the easier they were to see in the sample. A higher number doesn't mean anything sinister, it's just the higher the number the more benefit you should get from Tamoxifen, Letrozole or Arimidex etc.   Which are the 5  / 10 year tablets they can put you on at the end of main treatment.

You will often see ref's here to FEC-T the T is for Docetaxel and is another commonly used breast cancer chemo drug.  Some chemo regimes are just FEC some a combo of both (FEC-T) They are usually given three weeks apart. Sometimes given before surgery to shrink tumours, or after to clean up any random cells that may have got missed.  For more info you can check them out here. http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Combinationregimen/FEC-T.aspx Don't read too much into it for now, until you find out what regime they will have planned for you some of it may not apply. There is a long list of possible side effects at the bottom of the page, again don't let this sway you either, obviously from reading posts on here you will find out what the more common ones are and how we all coped with them. As for the 92/100 figures thrown at you they could mean anything ? When given a diagnosis your brain goes into overdrive and you don't always grasp what they are telling you and all the info gets a bid muddled. I can tell you Jackie ( my wife ) works with a nurse who was given chemo for breast cancer SEVENTEEN years ago with no problems since and there is a very high % of those in remission for five, even ten years plus and treatment has come a very long way in that time, more'so over the last few years.   Make a note of any questions you need answers to before you go to the demistifyng chemo session and it will help if you can take someone with you, as four ears will pick up more info than two  :-)  Hope this helps, and good luck whatever path you choose, George & Jackie.",

The trick with chemo is to not keep any secrets - You don't get a medal for suffering in silence :) if you do get any issues tell your Onco unit or breast care nurse - Oh, and post about it in the chemo club discussion too, so you get advice, support and info about easing side effects. The nerves will creep in as you feel it's all a bit out of control and are putting yourself into unknown territory.  Have you had a PICC line or port put in for your chemo or just having it done with a cannula at first ? Fingers crossed for a hassle free day tomorrow, take care, G n' J",

Try to remember that the scoring does not take into account individual diagnoses and treatments or the newer treatments being introduced (as it takes ages to update these prediction tools) most have a major cobweb issue :( The newer Predict Tool V2 doesn't even mention radiotherapy for instance :(  Which you would think plays a big part in reducing recurrence risk ?    Also your surgeon may not have had all the oncology information to input fully. There are just so'ooo many variables between individual patients even within those who have exactly the same type of breast cancer. Take care, G n' J",

From reading your profile page about your pathology report after surgery your cancer has been removed - all the other treatments are to avoid recurrence, so at the moment you haven't got cancer, it has been removed :) Please don't fret about this - know you really just want to get on with it, but enjoy your extended recovery period to build yourself back up to fitness before they start attacking you with needles. Have they mentioned getting you in to have a PICC line or port fitted to avoid cannulas ? Some health authority areas do this as standard, some don't  but if you get offered one - Go for it, they are brilliant :) Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya Jane, Although everyone would like to hear that their nodes are clear, it fairly common for some cells to be found in the nearest lymph nodes. It's the nodes job to trap anything dodgy like flu, mumps and other bugs etc that is why they swell up when you are poorly. It is far better for any random cells to be found 'trapped' there than for them to have found their way through the lymph system. As you have found Dr. Google isn't your friend at a time like this a lot of the info out there is either well outdated or misleading wrong and a lot of other sites trying to separate you from your cash on random cancer cures (yeah right, like they are gonna work - not) This is a step learning curve but take it a couple of days at a time so you don't overload your head with what if's over the next week.  One of our favourite sayings is 'Don't miss today's sunshine worrying about tomorrow's rain. So'ooo true, total waste of time overthinking stuff until you need to. At the start you beat yourself up so much with worries until you get to the stage where you realise what you are doing to yourself and you turn from a timid mouse into a feisty cat  :-) Oh! and you'll need some of these to keep you going until the 13th.

      "Content": "Hi calador  Femara is Letrozole, but to clarify that, Femara® is the original registered make of Letrozole. All the others that are just called letrozole are generic brands that were made by other pharma companies when the Novartis (the femara parent company's) license ran out after they had recovered all their research and development cash back. The price difference is massive - Femara is around £85 per month but the generics can be as little as £15 per month meaning GP's are very reluctant to issue prescriptions for the original Femara :( The main side effects besides the more common menopausal symptoms with all of these oestrogen inhibitor tablets could bone / joint aches.  Before starting Letrozole you should be given a Dexa Bone Density Scan; if you haven't been offered one ask your GP about getting one as letrozole and anastrozole can cause some bone thinning long term ?

Great to read you got through it, 28 is a crap age to get lumbered with BC :( Post treatment if you periods return you should always assume you could get pregnant, so this is a good question but for the ladies here to give a better reply could you let us know what treatment you had and if that included chemo, and if so which chemo drugs were used ? as some have a greater impact than others -  Also were you placed on Tamoxifen ? I'm thinking if you were ER+ that could limit your contraception choices ? As any of these treatments could affect your fertility to a greater or lesser extent post treatment.  Even if your periods have returned your ability to conceive could be affected as quality of the eggs you have may be compromised :( Take care, G n' J",

I can see it's not of much comfort if you feel you could be one of the 10% but percentages are just averages and we are all individuals - problem with that is percentages don't take individuals into consideration :( By the law of averages J should have had a lumpectomy and possibly rads only with her comparatively tiny 8mm DCIS with no node involvement - it was a bit of a shock when the surgeon said because of the position (small breasted and right behind the nipple) it has to be a mastectomy - then 2 weeks later along came Path-Man to ruin the party with their findings. ER+ PR+ also the nasty HER2+  Totaling 15 months of treatment followed by 5 years of Letrozole tablets - How little we knew what that left nipple slightly inverting was going to lead to :( At least there was treatment for this and for that we are thankful if it helps keep this away but no one ever really knows. All we have to go on are 5 year guesstimates and hope that the HER2+ part of this doesn't lead to secondaries at some time. Think we're all in leaky boats, bailing it out for the future unfortunately some have smaller buckets than others :( Hugs, G n' J",

J had her rads in Oct 2012 and her marks soon faded (within a year) and have have totally gone... so being permanent didn't happen -  unless they were heavy handed with the ink perhaps yours will too over time. They are only meant to be very small 1mm dots, like a small freckle ? A few Rads units now offer 'invisible' fluorescent tattoos, only visible under UV light. This came about because of problems occurring with conventional marks on dark skinned patients. Sounds such a good idea to me I think everyone should given these as standard practice :-) Try to see yours as a badge of survivorship rather than of being a cancer victim. If they are larger or more obvious than you would like perhaps a gp referral to a dermatologist could offer a removal solution - If you go this route be picky though, you could end up with a worse removal mark than what the 'dot' is :-?

      "Content": "Hi Lizane, Hadn't heard from you for a while, see why now (surgery) This tingling feeling sounds like it could be a touch of Peripheral Neuropathy from the docetaxel, or maybe nerve damage from surgery. It can take quite a while after chemo to travel down the long nerves in arms and legs before you get any effects in fingers and toes from it (are your toes ok ?)  It could also be slight nerve damage from having lymph removal surgery seeing as it's the same side although there was only one taken they still have to sever a lot of nerves you to get at it. Maybe leave it another couple of days to see if it eases as the nerves heal and knit back together more. You say it is worse operation side, so assume you have some in the other hand ? Don't think you would have it on both sides if it was lymph nerve damage ? but I'm not medically trained so wouldn't feel safe confirming that.... As for the seroma it can take quite a while to re-absorb the fluid it you are producing lots. They can use a long needle to drain some away to ease the discomfort but they don't really like doing this as it can be a cause of infection and will probably refill with fluid by making space for it anyway. If it gets really uncomfortable or starts getting painful seek further help with it as the internal pressure can put a strain on any internal stitches. Take care Lizane, and good luck with your recovery, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Morning Lizane, It's possible you weren't offered rads because your lymph nodes were negative and grade 2 but by all means do ask why they feel you don't need referring for radiotherapy if only to reassure you. Jackie was grade 3 and node negative but was given 15 rad sessions which apart from the daily travel inconvenience were a doddle compared to chemo, so maybe you are borderline for needing them ? If you would feel happier in yourself knowing you had thrown everything at it ask if you can have rads, they can only say no, unless for some medical reason they feel you would be at risk from rads. Like if the area to be treated was very close to either heart or lungs and couldn't be screened out from the radiation beams. They may say \"why, do you think you need them\" putting the ball in your court, so give it some thought in case they offer you the choice. http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/BreastDCIS/TreatingDCIS/Radiotherapy.aspx You would be given the Tamoxifen whether you have the rads or not, so unfortunately you won't get away with that - It's a case of as well as, not instead of :-( Keep writing those questions down for today, take care, George & Jackie",

I can see it's not of much comfort if you feel you could be one of the 10% but percentages are just averages and we are all individuals - problem with that is percentages don't take individuals into consideration :( By the law of averages J should have had a lumpectomy and possibly rads only with her comparatively tiny 8mm DCIS with no node involvement - it was a bit of a shock when the surgeon said because of the position (small breasted and right behind the nipple) it has to be a mastectomy - then 2 weeks later along came Path-Man to ruin the party with their findings. ER+ PR+ also the nasty HER2+  Totaling 15 months of treatment followed by 5 years of Letrozole tablets - How little we knew what that left nipple slightly inverting was going to lead to :( At least there was treatment for this and for that we are thankful if it helps keep this away but no one ever really knows. All we have to go on are 5 year guesstimates and hope that the HER2+ part of this doesn't lead to secondaries at some time.

J my better half had surgery first within 2 weeks of her breast cancer diagnosis biopsy results came through and the rest of her treatments were tailored to her BC type from the surgery tissue lab results but having to wait another few weeks would make very little or no difference to the risk of this having spread further. Don't fret over whatever size it is, it may well still be contained to one area and certainly don't worry about this being something you may have caused - that is rarely the case. Looks like your message got cut short; was there something else you wanted ask ?  \"What I really want to know\" ?? Assume you are just over the border from us in Norfolk then ?

      "Content": "Morning Ruby Rose Got the notification from Leolady about Risedronate (35mg) and as you seem to have found out there are very few possible side effects from it. J my better half was taking Alendronic Acid (Fosamax) which is very similar (one tablet per week) for 5 years with no problems whatsoever. These are both bone strengthening drugs, usually taken if you are a slightly osteopaenic and taking something like Letrozole, Anastrozole etc. Only comment I would make is the oncologist put her on Alendronic Acid as the bone density benefits were better with that than from Risedronate, so it may be worth asking yours about the difference to you ? Whilst taking them she was also taking Adcal+ chews (one twice a day) the + means they have added vitamin D3. The only thing you have to be really careful with is to ensure you take Risedronate with plenty of water (at least half a pint) and you must remain upright (standing or seated) for at least 30 minutes aftwerwards or the drug can damage your oesophagus. These type of meds can be a bit unsuitable for anyone with reflux or oesophagus problems that can cause them not to reach the stomach within half an hour as the tablet coating disolves after that time. So that probably explains the omeprazole to lower your stomach acid. Her Alendronic tabs were 70mg - do you know if the Risedronate you will be taking are 35mg ? How bad is your PN ? J still has slightly numb big toes 6 years on. Hugs, G n' J",

As long as you realise this is you, you are not your mum BC treatment has a very high % of success compared to most other cancers inc lung.  Everyone else around you will only know the horror stories about terminal cases as seen in tv soaps and the media that unless they have had personal dealings with cancer in their own families never get to hear about the very high percentage that beat this crap disease and go on to live almost normal lives afterwards. So you get the sorrowful looks and the head nods now and later when you are mid treatment you will get 'you look well'  and 'you are being so brave'  which, yes you are but you have no choice - you just don't want to hear it from everyone you meet :-) This is a great place full to bursting with members who will go the extra mile with you and give you friendly advice, support and helpful tips on every stage of your treatments. There is always someone at exactly the same treatment stage as you to share the journey with, many become firm friends. Do you know your HER2 status from pathology yet ? If you are HER2+ you will probably be given Herceptin as well but that is a pussycat, so don't fret about it if you get that drug chucked at you as well. See you also joined the under 50's group - that's ok you can read posts from other younger women diagnosed but that group isn't very active compared to this one, so if you need info in a hurry this is the one to post to first.   A few rules... Don't google stuff most of the info out there is either way out of date, or misleadingly wrong. Stick with reliable uk sites like Macmillan and breastcancer care uk - don't ever feel you have to apologise for letting off steam here if you get down days and there is no such thing as a silly question  :-) Won't say welcome to the club as no one really wants to be here :-/ Take care Mandy, George & Jackie",

As they can reduce your other breast down to near enough match with the reconstruction. They tend not to carry out large cup reconstructions as the weight creates healing and recovery issues. Balance after a mastectomy is always a big problem for larger ladies. A lot of ladies take this option, it isn't perfect but it is better than spending the rest of your life this way. As for your underwired bras, you can always 'nick' the fabric and remove the wire from your surgery side cup for now if it helps. The full prothesis can also be a problem as it is so much heavier than the softies. Has anything been mentioned to you about a reconstruction yet ? Take care, G n' J Islanikita",

Also If the symptoms are dry, scaly skin around the nipple It can very often mistaken by GP's initially as eczema too. The usual time frame for biopsy results is 10-14 days which everyone here hates with a passion - that two week waiting results time can be emotionally crushing :( You just have to hope for the best, rather than fearing the worst and try to get through this period with your sanity intact.  Feeling painful for a few days afterwards is the norm but this does ease off after a while. Depending on how deep they were taken from as the breast and nipple area has lots of nerves and is very sensitive. Having the ultrasound come back clear is a good sign but not wanting to dash your hopes, there are quite a few ladies here that were diagnosed with BC who also had nothing confirmed from mammogram or ultrasound, unfortunately it's not an exact science. Keep posting messages and asking any questions you have, it will let us help you get through the next week or two.

About your nails - Are you on a Tax type chemo (Docetaxel, Taxol, Taxotere ?) they are the main ones that affect nails. The blue / purple colour may turn to black and you may lose some of your nails but will soon have new ones underneath. You can read more about it here. Know it is a page from the Australian Breast Cancer Network but it's the best page for chemo nail information. Don't think it will be a heart / circulation problem but you could show them your nails and ask next time you are there. You got good advice about drinking plenty of fluids it helps flush the chemo through your kidneys and liver and gets the residue out of your system quicker which can help ease some of the side effects.

The feeling everything is starting to get a bit out of control ? There's no manual as all couples are different your wife may want to know all the in's and out's but could just as easily not want to talk about it at all and just wants it all to go away. Don't go overthinking this and getting way ahead of yourselves reconstruction may not be needed with a lumpectomy if it comes to that. Just deal with this in bite size pieces one week at a time (one day at a time if easier) - It's so easy to get all consumed by this and waste a lot of time reading up about treatments that may not be needed. Breast Cancer Care produce a booklet \"In It Together\" which you might find helpful. Just click the title, this can also be saved if you would like to refer back to it. The booklet assumes a breast cancer diagnosis is confirmed but this isn't actually you two yet, and hopefully won't be so just take in the emotional 'being there' section and reach / cross the other bridges if needed.

It doesn't necessarily mean damage from spread to the liver in the way you are thinking. Some of the other things which could cause this to raise slightly are having previously damaged your liver (car accident etc) smoking, drinking alcohol, and use of many prescription and non-prescription drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lipid-lowering drugs (statins), antibiotics, histamine blockers (used to treat excess stomach acid production), antifungal agents, anticonvulsants (seizure control medications), antidepressants can all affect the gamma ggt level. You are right though, as soon as you hear the word cancer all the scary what if's come out of the cupboard to put your mind into overdrive and it's hard to ignore them until you get some answers about what the heck is going on.

This is where they fine tune and tailor your treatment plan. Also you will find out if you are ER+ positive (oestrogen) and more importantly as far as chemo goes your HER2 status. If you are HER2+ you will need Herceptin and this is always given in conjunction with chemotherapy. You can read more about his here 'Understanding Your Pathology Report' The section about ER and HER2 starts on page 12. Do you know what type of breast cancer you were diagnosed with (Ductal DCIS, Lobular, Invasive etc) as this may also have a bearing on chemo being offered. I have no idea what your job entails but I think returning to work so soon may be expecting a bit too much. Have you spoken to them about a phased return, if not do wait until you find out more Friday . Always expect the unexpected as it is not unusual for them to upgrade from 2 up to a 3 because they have a lot more tissue to examine and the biopsy may not have been taken from the most aggressive area. Keeping our fingers crossed for you, good luck Friday. G n' J",

These can feel quite strange at times from feeling hot, cold or even wet to little electric shocks or brief twinges. Can you get back to us with a little more info ?  If this is from nerve damage it does heal and disappear after a couple of weeks :) Hope you are finding the post surgery exercises manageable. Take care, G n' J",

Tea is thought to contain more caffeine than coffee unless you like your coffee really strong (caffeine is a diuretic) so if you need a tea time hot drink it may be better to have a coffee rather than tea, better still a glass of milk cold or warm in the evening instead of water based drink may help you not wanting to get up so often for a pee ? If you aren't taking any diuretics but think you may be feeling thirsty too often it may be worth having a quick diabetes test next time you are at your GP's as constant thirst can be a diabetes symptom it can also be a sign of hyperthyroidism ?

They will try to find out if it was the FEC that has caused a loss of heart function (chamber muscle strength) or it may even be a problem you have always had but until now has never been found ? Jackie had 4 Herceptin sessions and her heart function dropped below their base level and they cancelled it for that period and she missed one session - Three weeks later her heart function had recovered enough to continue with Herceptin and she had no other delays until she finished the 18 session course. Hopefully it's just a blip and you will get given the Herceptin when things improve, but if this is a problem not caused by cancer treatment it may be your heart just isn't strong enough to handle the side effects - They certainly won't risk it causing any permanent damage which can happen in some cases :-( There is a bit of info about Herceptin and heart issues here.

      "Content": "Evening Ann156 Sorry to read about your nails - is your chemo one of the taxanes like Docetaxel or Paclitaxel ? or something else. As there several types which can cause this. For some painting your nails black or using a black base coat for another darker colour on top like purple etc can help as it reduces the UV light reaction some people get.  This is usually done before starting chemo so may be a little late for you but could help if you have more sessions to follow. If you do decide to paint your nails get hold of some Acetone Free remover as it won't dry the skin out so much. It could lead to nail loss if the nail bed is badly affected but this my not happen until a new nail has formed underneath and they sort of delaminate. Mac has an info page about Skin and Nailcare (link) while on treatment you can read through, but do keep a lookout for the October Chemo Discussion in the Breast Group you joined and ask about this problem there too. If they do start lifting you can keep them in place with steristrip to avoid snagging them on clothing etc - J lost all 20 of hers over a 4 month period post Docetaxel, but it is very uncommon to loose all of them; but if you are prone to this keep a check on your toenails as well :-/ Hope this is of some help, take care, G n' J",

Very much like when you get generic versions of hormone inhibitor tablets (don't get me started on those)  :-/ The biggest stumbling block is complimentary vs alternative. To my mind alternative is the last resort when all the conventional treatments and meds have been tried and for whatever reason not worked.  It's certainly (in my view) something you should not be looking into at the start of treatment or when newly diagnosed. Chemotherapy can sound very scary and taking a few herbal remedies can seem a much easier alternative - No one surely would recommend using any alternative therapies at this stage ? If you are already 'into' the Supplements / Herbal lifestyle way of thinking this probably comes as second nature but there are a lot of members who haven't the patience or time to wade through all the tech talk about these different compounds to weigh up what could be beneficial - yet alone have the finances to pay out what, £60 maybe much more every month for them when getting by with a cancer induced lower income is their main priority. We are all different and have differing views of all this all you can do is what feels right for you! Personally I view a lot of this like Jehovah's ringing our doorbell, I don't agree with their views but it's their life to lead however they want to - I just don't want or need converting thanks :) Now where did I put that cup of tea and chocolate Hobnob....  G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Gaynor, Sorry to read that the cold cap hasn't been as successful for you. Unfortunately like all these treatments be it chemotherapy drugs, hormone inhibitor tablets etc, everyone get affected differently by them. Some can sail through one sort of chemo relatively side effect free only be hit by a truck with the second set and vice-versa. The soreness you are feeling is tied in with the hair loss. A lot of members here just prior to losing hair mention a pulling feeling like when you were a child and having a 'too tight' ponytail in ? There is no way to tell if you will lose more hair or if it will stabilise but if it gets to the 'what a mess - I can't be dealing with this' stage and you decide to lose it, clipper it short, don't shave it because if you 'nick' your scalp it can become a site for infection to get in. You would be surprised the number of folks who get wigs and then only wear them a couple of times and go the bandanna / hat route. Have you got a wig cap liner for your head, if not they one is worth getting as wigs can make you head a bit hot / sweaty and itchy. J never even bothered getting a wig, she bought some bandannas but mostly went 'commando' which is quite apt really because you not only look like one, as far as cancer is concerned you are giving it such a pasting.... No matter what happens with your hair at the end of the day as long as when you look in the mirror you see a warrior looking back at you and not a victim, you'll be fine. Any hair lost will grow back so although you may feel your hair defined you it does tend to slip down your list of priorities quite rapidly as you progress through chemo. It's great later when is does 'peach' back through though :-) How many TC are you having in total ? Do check out and join in with  the August Chemo Club Discussion. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa, Regarding you asking about Tax - It's a bit confusing. Tax mentioned here is usually Taxotere also known as Docetaxel - However there is also a chemo drug named Taxol also known as Paclitaxel which can also be used for breast cancer which is sometimes wrongly called Tax The main differences are Taxotere is given at 3 weekly intervals mostly by the NHS where Taxol is given in smaller doses weekly mostly by those getting private treatment through BUPA etc Sometimes you will get Taxol through the nhs but because the nhs saves money by only having one session every three weeks and Taxotere is a bit cheaper than Taxol. The side effects with Taxol are usually not so severe because of the smaller more do'able doses. You will see it written here as FEC-T which is the most common chemo regime for BC.  FEC is 3 dif drugs given at the same time then you switch to T (taxotere) both are mostly 3 or 4 sessions of each given at 3 weekly intervals. If you want to have a read of the Maccy info pages just click the green text links below. T = Taxotere (Docetaxel) T = Taxol (Paclitaxel) FEC = combination chemo ( 3 drugs) The EC you see mentioned on this thread is FEC but without the F part which is Fluorouracil 5FU  Some oncologists are now not including the F part as it can affect the heart and side effects from EC are more manageable.

Macmillan cannot take any chances as there are many really vulnerable members here who may think Macmillan is actually promoting 'whatever substance' is being linked to - there are so many scammers out there willing to sell anything of dubious quality to anyone. At the moment it's a bit like where they replace carbon dioxide in beer with helium (guaranteed to stop drunk people arguing / fighting) but it's not been proved legally safe to drink :) There are loads of really promising trials going ahead using cannabinoids at the present time but like everything else it takes forever to get new meds tested and licensed.  It took around 6 years to get the cannabis derived meds Sativex (for MS) and Epidiolex (for epilepsy) through all the regulations. It would help if the government took it on through the NHS/NICE and produced a list of cannabis oil makes that were known to be consistent quality, safe and legal to purchase in the UK, but until then unfortunately it's still too much of a grey area. At least that would stop all the dodgy stuff being sold. G n' J",

Only in very, very rare exceptional circumstances is no treatment at all offered - The chances of them saying this to you is is near to nil as you could possibly get. In the grand scheme of things tumour size doesn't count for much regarding prognosis - some ovarian tumours can be the size of footballs :( You will feel aches and pains, some as you mention from the biopsy - Others from you being all tensed up and probably subconsciously moving around in a more protective way which is causing you to use different muscles, lack of sleep etc - it all adds up to Jojo with no Mojo.

According to NICE Herceptin is only licensed to be given in conjunction with any of the Taxane type chemo drugs (Taxol/Taxotere) when treating HER2+ breast cancer. Which is more commonly FEC or EC sessions first then switching to Taxotere or Taxol for the Herceptin. I was always under the impression that because both the Epirubicin and Herceptin can cause damage to the heart muscle, so regarding FEC or EC they are not given together (double whammy) I'd suggest you ask your oncologist on Monday for clarification, or get in touch with your Onco unit or BCN today to double check that they have got you down for having Herceptin ? and will be getting changed to T after 3 sessions of EC or if they are following a different regime.

Afraid I can't help much either as J's was HER2+ positive so needing chemo a no brainer :( I'll attach the score graph for the Oncotype -DX test so you can see the results range. As mentioned it is the intermediate score (18-31) which puts the choice down to you. Don't forget a lot of people just assume recurrence is getting it come back in the same breast - which to an extent it is, but having chemo will also safeguard you against the future risk of secondary cancer elsewhere in the body too. There is a lot to take into consideration with your decision should you need to make it. Hopefully your score will come back so low it would be of minimal benefit.

Main things to take on board are definitely no cleaning up puddles and mishaps, avoiding any licking making sure the puppy is inoculated, wormed and healthy prior to you getting it home, regular washing of hands if pets are handled. Care against scratches and those sharp puppy teeth. No need to really wrap yourself up in cotton wool and not leave the house for 18 weeks you just can't live like that, and have to use a bit of common sense - most of any infections that are picked up during the middle week are from yourself.... rather than from other people - as we carry loads of bugs around with us that normally are no problem for our immune system. You could also go for a docile breed type rather than the hypo breeds that bound around and fly about like a dawg possessed :-) Biggest problem is that a lot of days during chemo you just haven't got the energy to drag yourself out of the house for walkie's, but on the days you are feeling a bit brighter a stroll in the fresh air is great. Those cra* days are the days it will be someone else getting the joys of dog walking. Just don't forget when you feel you have walked far enough, you have to turn around and walk all the way back again :-/ Take care, G n' J",

Have you actually been diagnosed with BC after seeing nothing on the scans or are you being checked out and are worried in case you are diagnosed with this although nothing is visible ? In answer to your question, yes! quite a few ladies here have been diagnosed after having nothing visible in the way of lumps. In the same way as lots who have had lumps or other signs have found them to be cysts, areas of calcification or any of the other many non-cancerous breast problems. Not all types of breast cancer appear as a lump and there are also other symptoms that can appear before any lumps form, like a nipple starting to invert or pucker, breast skin texture looking different, discharge or bleeding from nipple, breast looking inflamed (red and feeling hot) besides aches and twinges which could be put down to monthly hormone changes but may be an initial sign of something more sinister. Younger women's breast tissue is also lot more dense so that can cause problems with getting a good mammogram image. Do get back to us with a little more info as to what problems you have or where you are at the diagnosis stage so we can give you some support and info. Take care, G n' J",

I would be a bit concerned too :-/ If they could feel something but not 'see' it why didn't they try to biopsy them or send you for an MRI scan ? Whether these lumps painful or not (some are and some aren't) sometimes any pain increase or decrease can follow your monthly cycle if the lumps are hormone related - perhaps this is why they want to let you keep an eye on it for a few weeks to see if anything changes. Have you noticed any changes during your cycle or do these lumps always feel the same throughout the 28 days ? Sometimes lobular type breast cancer isn't 'seen' on ultrasound either. Personally I wouldn't let this lie for too long if at all, you need answers - I don't want to worry you but if something doesn't feel right then something must be wrong, hopefully something minor but it needs looking into further not dismissing. Do look out for more replies to your message during the day as I'm certain you will get several with other members views on this. If it was me I would make it really clear you are not happy with the wait and watch approach it is wrong that you have these lumps and nothing is going to be done to find out what they are as a matter of urgency :(   Especially as you have a family history of BC and OC - Did your consultant know about your family history, if not he / she needs making aware of this and put you forward for further checks. How on earth they expect you to lead a worry free normal family life when you have this scary unanswered question is beyond me. Oh, and don't let them play the you are too young card either, there are cases of women in their late twenties diagnosed with BC which unfortunately seems to be on the increase. Do have a read about breast lumps here, it explains what any lump(s) could be. Maybe something will seem similar to what you may have. I'm trying so hard to not alarm you but do chase this up again to find out exactly what this is, for your own peace of mind. G n' J",

Because the flap types use your own tissue they are basically a double operation for each breast.  It is a surprisingly higher number than you would first think who seem to get recovery issues too, with either the reconstruction site, or the donor tissue site. Now you are back at home, in your own bed getting a better nights sleep than in a noisy hospital ward hopefully your recovery will speed up a tad.

You could have a chat with your Onco about this and also see if they are willing to try you on a minimal steroid dosage, or lower your Docetaxel dosage by 20% so you need a lot lower dose of steroids.Lowering it by 20% won't be detrimental to it's effectiveness. You could ask about being given weekly Paclitaxel also known as Taxol, which is very similar to Docetaxel but in smaller weekly doses therefore a lot less of a problem with side effects ? Paclitaxel could possibly be do'able without the steroids at all ?  I'm not medically trained so you will have to seek their advice on this but from the sounds of your previous problems anything has to be better than going through that again :-/ There are options so do get some answers to help you get through this.

If there are obvious dangers the poster may not know about, by all means advise but that's as far as arm twisting should go. Everyone goes through so much angst dealing with cancer and the side effects of treatment, if you can find something that helps with this then why should anyone criticise that - it's your body after all :)  and there is a lot to be said for quality over quantity post cancer treatment. I think a lot of the worrying issues are when members start talking about alternative as opposed to complimentary. There are those who feel alternative is the best way to go, but if you are a firm believer in conventional medicine it is really scary to read someone may forego this in the hope that some obscure natural remedy may cure them. I must admit I've never checked a turkeys tail to see if mushrooms grew there  LOL G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning  Kathy,  Are you are worried because you don't really know why they are not offering you any other treatment, or worried because you are \"not\" getting it ? Either way you have to ask specific questions to medical staff. They don't \"get it\" if you just hint at something you need info about. So to clear that one up I think the first Q should be why have they decided you don't need any other treatment and if you don't understand any parts of their answer tell them. Some of these medical folks spend so much time talking \"tech speak\" amongst themselves they find it hard putting info into plain english that we can understand :-)   You could ask about what the next step is regarding monitoring you, how long before your next check up and will it just be a mammogram or ultrasound scan. If you think you may need some info for future reference maybe for getting travel/medical insurance, or just for \"you\" in case as time goes by you forget some details etc ask to have a printout of all your diagnosis and treatments. I guess you are not going to be taking any of the (5 year) hormone tablets either then ? So if that is the case you won't need to worry about Dexa bone scans for osteopenia, but if you are on these, then do ask about that side of it too. If you feel brave enough you could ask about chances of re-occurance over any given time span. Coming to the end of your treatment can make you feel a bit abandoned and forgotten about especially if you have practically lived your life around doctor and hospital appointments for what seems like ages. Perfectly normal and this isn't the case - it's just that now in their eyes you are cancer free and cured........... Now that IS worth celebrating. Maybe you'll get a few more answers before your appt today adding anything I may have missed, especially regarding the ld recon as Jackie never had this. Take care,  George & Jackie",

You spend what seems ages fretting while waiting the scan and biopsy results - you get surgery and in your head you know the cancer has been removed and after the anaesthetic wears off you feel great  about this. Then it dawns on you you only know half the story and the worries start simmering again while you wait for the pathology results. It's not a case of panicking for nothing, it's more like it doesn't matter how much you panic it won't change the results, so the panicking needs telling to 'sod off' while you concentrate on recovering from surgery :-) You can have a read of this 'Understanding Your Pathology Report' before Wednesday and see if it raises any questions you may want to ask about further treatments they may offer you ? Have you been told anything as yet - type of bc etc Do reply if you have other concerns, the only silly questions are the ones not asked... Just noticed your other reply, the shooting pains you describe sound very much like any nerves cut during surgery trying to repair themselves. This can feel like sharp twinges, stabs, even little electric shocks - some have even mentioned it feeling like it's wet from hot or cold water too ? Take care, and good luck with your results.

About your question 'how deep' is a tough one to answer because the very nature of SNLB is that the sentinel node is regarded as the nearest one but this usually found with the tracer dye so could be in towards the breast or in the armpit. Surgery to the armpit could be quite deep, depending on how far they had to 'go in' to reach it. Keep up with the painkillers, ask if you can use some with and without paracetamol in if that is ok, you can alternate taking some every two hourly - this may also be pain from any cut nerves repairing themselves as well and sometimes these 'pangs' can feel really weird.

When your white count is low, it is surprisingly easy for something you would normally simply shrug off to take hold and floor you. Try to make the most of this 'free' time to build yourself up in prep for the chemo and buying some valuable extra healing time. Everyone would much prefer to just get on with it and get treatment started, but it's much better for you long term if you are as fit as possible before you start down that particular road :) Fingers crossed for the 2nd, hugs, G n' J",

They can also make you want to nibble snacks all the time.  They are always given with chemo along with the anti sickness tablets they do help with the side effects a bit so keep taking them even if you feel fine.   If your new cycle is Taxotere (docetaxel)  you will get a 3 or 4 day honeymoon period where you think 'this is ok' - then you wake up and could feel like you have been hit by a truck during the night (some get away with it) just letting you know in case it happens. Affects your bones and joints and coupled with fatigue you can feel like you aged 20 years overnight for a few days - If this happens you will start to feel a bit better by around day 9 or 10. Don't be surprised if you need a longer siesta time. It may help if you get some mouthwash with Chlorhexidine in if not from the hospital get some Corsodyl from a pharmacy because mouth ulcers and oral thrush is quite common with Tax.

It's very unfortunate you were in hospital when your sister in law was so poorly but maybe you will have better memories of her because of this. It won't stop your feelings of guilt about being unable to visit, but with palliative care and strong pain relief she may well have not even realised you were there :-( When you are over this, you can do stuff with her children to help ease their loss. Grade 2 ductal is usually borderline for chemo. ER- negative means you will not need the 5 years worth of hormone inhibitor tablets, but you will probably be given radiotherapy later. So this means your further treatment all hinges on if you are HER2 positive or negative ? If you are HER2+ positive you will be offered/given Herceptin. This is licensed by NICE to only be used in conjunction with chemo, it is never given on it's own. You aren't a complete mess, you just need to give yourself some time to accept all the very emotional things that are going on around you. The tears are helping with this, it certainly is a lot better than trying to be strong (whatever that means) bottling it all up and having a major meltdown later.

Unless tissue samples from the path lab upgrades them these are at first classed as grade zero. Where the cells 'break out through the wall where it was contained  it then becomes invasive, sounds harsh but may only mean a few cells have settled in areas close to the original cluster - terms like like vascular invasion or some cells found trapped in the nearest lymph nodes. Early can also be used where the tumour size is small, but as we all know even small tumours can be found to be a higher grade 2 or 3, so this is a bit of a misconception. it is a very grey area and 'early' is a loosely used term (even by us here) and personally I don't think it counts for much.  Jackie was DCIS (grade zero remember ?) with a fairly small 8mm tumour just behind the nipple. Post surgery pathology confirmed it was in fact Grade 3 ER+  &  PR+  and also HER2+ so she had MX, 6 x chemo, 18 x  Herceptin and 15 x rads - So DCIS doesn't count for much until the final results are in :( Think I've just muddied the water a bit,  G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya, 'Early' can mean several things like finding it within 4 months of a previous clear mammogram or while looking for something else unrelated, but in the true sense of their wording for BC it would be DCIS or LCIS (ductal or lobular in situ) it doesn't become classed as invasive while it is contained (in situ)  Early can also refer to finding a pre-cancerous condition. Unless tissue samples from the path lab upgrades them these are at first classed as grade zero. Where the cells 'break out through the wall where it was contained  it then becomes invasive, sounds harsh but may only mean a few cells have settled in areas close to the original cluster - terms like like vascular invasion or some cells found trapped in the nearest lymph nodes. Early can also be used where the tumour size is small, but as we all know even small tumours can be found to be a higher grade 2 or 3, so this is a bit of a misconception. it is a very grey area and 'early' is a loosely used term (even by us here) and personally I don't think it counts for much.  Jackie was DCIS (grade zero remember ?) with a fairly small 8mm tumour just behind the nipple. Post surgery pathology confirmed it was in fact Grade 3 ER+  &  PR+  and also HER2+ so she had MX, 6 x chemo, 18 x  Herceptin and 15 x rads - So DCIS doesn't count for much until the final results are in :( Think I've just muddied the water a bit,  G n' J",

Although brittle nails aren't listed as a common side effect from Tamoxifen hair thinning is and hair and nails are made from the same stuff so if it affects hair chances are it can effect nails too :( There are loads of messages here and in Breast Cancer Care forums about brittle nails and Tamoxifen so there must be something in it. Jackie lost all 20 of her nails but that was definitely down to chemo and is currently 4 years into Letrozole so we have no real experience of Tamoxifen. It could be your nails were affected by the chemo and the tamoxifen is stopping them fully recovering ? Hopefully the lovely ladies here can advise you on loads of various nail moisturising / strengthening treatments that will help. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi 58Petals, Welcome to the BC Group. A great place to be at a tough time! OK, think you need that big worry of yours putting to rest. The recovery rate for breast cancer is currently around 90% and that includes up to grade 3 so seeing as yours is stage 1 this means it has been found early enough to not have grown to a significant size. Have they given you any indication as to what type of breast cancer this is, or is it too early to say ? If they were really concerned about you they would have suggested a mastectomy and not a lumpectomy and possibly chemo prior to surgery - so although you are still in shock this could have been so much worse. The node removal may well just be a 3 or 4 node sampling to check rather than a full removal, unless they have definitely told you this. Won't spend too much time replying as no doubt you will get lots of other replies as this is a very active, friendly place. The pains everywhere you are feeling is more than likely because you are all tensed up and worried sick more than anything sinister - It happens to all of us at the very beginning. Where it is all new and very scary.... So sorry to read about your husband, hope he is well post surgery. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Scared10  Everyone hopes to find they have clear nodes or minimal nodes affected sorry to read you had eight found to contain cancer cells :( It is the nodes job to trap these cells so they have done their job with 8 out of 24 that figure could have been so much worse though and the CT scan you are having is something everyone has prior to starting chemo, as for the bone scan do try to look at this as they are checking you over to rule spread out rather than the alternative. Chemotherapy can start quite soon post surgery so be prepared for things to happen fairly quickly. Don't know if you know anything about ER (oestrogen) but being ER7+ you will also be given hormone inhibitor tablets at some time between chemo and rads - these are taken for 5 or even 10 years and offer good protection against the risk of  recurrence. There is a very active monthly chemo club within the main breast group you can check out just do a group search for August Chemo Club. Hope this is of some help at a scary time.

Either like yourself newly diagnosed and fearful of the unknown or finished treatment and helping others with friendly support advice and a few laughs to help lighten the load. The way you are feeling is totally normal for the first few weeks you are mostly in the dark and have to many 'what if' worries this all changes when you know exactly what you will be dealing with as it allows you to concentrate on the next step to kicking cancer where it hurts. A couple of things that can help you for now is click the button at the top of the page that says 'Join This Group'  that way you not only get email notifications for all the messages posted, you will see a New Discussion button appear so you can start your own discussion asking any specific questions you may have knowing all the replies will be specifically for you :) Another good point to remember is making good use of the 'Save This To My Favourites' option in the discussion tools section. All favourites you select will be saved under the 'Favourites' tab on your profile page so you can easily find them again. Hopefully the rib and back aches will be down to you tensing up with the stress and worry of all this and no doubt more than a few disturbed nights sleep too. Very best wishes for some good news when you go for your results next week, do join the group and keep posting whenever you need some reassurance or questions answered, we're all here to help.

You haven't (spelt woefully wrong) or cocodamol  :) Being prescribed co-codamol is good as you should get advice rather than just buying them on a regular basis over the counter and not bothering to read the patient info leaflet. Chances are the prescribed ones may have a higher Codeine content though.  Co-codamol is available in different doses. They all contain 500mg of paracetamol (the same as one regular paracetamol tablet or capsule) but the dose of codeine varies and can be 8mg, 15mg or 30 mg. If you are on one of the higher doses try not to take them for too long if possible (4 to 5 days) as codeine is a mild opiate and you can become addicted to them. There is an increased risk of constipation with the 30mg ones too so keep the fluid intake up if they are the ones you have :) G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Nicola  nicolaangie66  Warm welcome to the group, not that we like seeing so many new members to this particular club :( Hope you are recovering well from your surgery. Your consultant may also have explained that post surgery the cancer had been removed and everything else is follow on insurance to try and eliminate as best as possible risk of recurrence at a later date ? Being strongly ER/PR+ positive this will mean long term (at least 5 years) of hormone therapy tablets (one a day) to reduce the oestrogen in your body so if any cancer cells have escaped from the surgery sites this will cut off their food supply. If you are pre menopause this may well be Tamoxifen - post menopause it is usually Letrozole or Anastrozole. The newish POSNOC trial is quite good (several of the ladies here have had it) It can save you being over-treated like having all your lymph nodes removed when the risk is very low and may be unwarranted, or being placed onto chemotherapy when the need of this 'for you' is low.  So only those who would benefit the most get these treatments (and their side effects) rather than giving it to everyone if needed or not. For instance it's not really worth putting yourself through 18 weeks of chemo if it will only reduce your recurrence risk by 1%  Having said that chemo could be less of a problem than a full axillary clearance. If it is recommeded you have one or the other, caught between a rock and a hard place comes to mind :-/ It is better for you if you can avoid un-needed treatments because they all come with risks like lymphoedema if your nodes are removed and some longer term chemo side effects. If you want to read up on POSNOC just click this link :) Don't know if the Bisothingy's are biological therapies, or bi-phosphonates ?  LOL Hope this helps a bit, look forward to seeing you about the place :)  No such thing as a silly question here, if you need answers just holler, we're all here to help.

      "Content": "Hi Pinkshoe, This is probably a question to ask your Onco about. The hormone inhibitor tablets can be started at any time, sometimes even before surgery to help shrink things. It is common to start these up to 6 weeks after any chemo has finished (don't know if you had chemo prior to surgery) If you haven't had chemo it may be that you having to use that Vac-Pac has shoved things back a few weeks but I'm not aware of any reasons why you can't start the hormone therapy before rads ? The usual practice is to start after rads so you need to find out if you need to be put onto them now or if they are starting you after rads. Even if you have a date for your rads this will add another 3 weeks to the waiting time which is pushing the time without them. It may be that the Onco doesn't realise your rads are delayed (they should, but you never know) cross department information between surgeon, rads and onco can get lost. So do give onco a ring and get some answers rather than worry about this pause in your treatment schedule. G n' J",

All these results whether positive or negative will always be told face to face as they will want to explain the results in full detail. Be those about a cyst, calcification, firbroid or if cancer cells were found. In ladies who have denser breast tissue the mammogram images aren't so clear, that is why they follow up with an ultrasound and/or biopsy so you don't slip through the net.

      "Content": "Hiya Mr T, Your'e gonna have to start using your christian name - Everytime I see Mr T I keep thinking it's a post about the chemo drug Taxotere 'as it's commonly known as mr t here'  :-) Did they tell you both which chemo drugs your partner will be having (FEC-T) perhaps ? Regarding recon - It's a very personal choice. Some can't be bothered with all the hassle of more surgery after a long treatment regime especially if surgery is performed before chemo and recon surgery is planned possibly up to a year later. Mostly they use chemo before surgery to reduce tumour size to enable a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, but if they have told you a mastectomy is on the cards, they must have their reasons for discounting a lumpectomy from the start. With chemo prior to surgery at least the recon can be performed at the same time but this may mean any radiotherapy required has to wait until the recon has fully healed as rads can interfere with recon tissue. There are also many different types of recon some may be suitable for your partner, some not - especially those requiring tissue used from elsewhere in the body like tummy or back. Most here who have had a recon after a few months coming to terms with it find they are pleased with the results, some unfortunately have infection and other issues and have to have the breast or implant removed and wish they hadn't bothered. As you can see there are many pro's and cons - No doubt you will get loads of replies from those who have a recon and those who didn't which is great as it will give you both lots of information to help make this decision but this is along way off as yet. If your partner would like to get this settled in her head now you could have a read of this Macmillan booklet 'Understanding Breast Reconstruction' be aware it does contain post surgery images. As for us, Jackie didn't go the recon route and she is happy with that. After surgery, chemo Herceptin and rads she had by all that time already got used to being boobless one side and being small breasted made the choice easier - if she's happy so am I. If you have any questions regarding starting chemo, ask away - we've nearly all been there, not many dodge the chemo bullet. Take care, G n' J",

Breathlessness is quite common during chemo, but it can also be a symptom of other issues that need checking / eliminating. I pasted this in from the Taxol info page - Taxol / Paclitaxel can reduce the number of red blood cells in your blood. These cells carry oxygen around the body. If the number of red blood cells is low, you may be tired and breathless. Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel like this. If you are very anaemic, you may need a drip to give you extra red blood cells (blood transfusion). Hope this is easily fixed, G n' J",

They calculate the total full dose you need which is divided into safe daily 'fractions' These can work out anything between 15 and 25 days but 15 in the more normal period. I can't recall anyone here having rads at weekends as that is when they 'rest' you to reduce the risk of burning in a delicate area and give your normal cells chance to recover. The Linear Accelerators (Linac) are high maintenance and often breakdown too so any servicing work is carried out at weekends. Have a lovely 'girlie' time during you daughters stay.

As you say there seem to be UK trials ongoing for using it to treat prostrate and a few other cancers but no mention of breast. I'll put the web address in, maybe you can find more info from links on that page. It states that it cannot be used to treat lymph nodes though :-(    and the sound waves do not travel through bone or air but maybe in the future this more non invasive treatment will become more commonplace. I can't see it replacing chemo for ages though, as it seems to be used for treating a single mass not anything with any kind of spread. So no good for mopping up stray cells. Seems like a sonic version of a Radiotherapy cyberknife.   http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/cancer-questions/high-intensity-focused-ultrasound Hope this helps, best wishes and good luck,  George & jackie.",

The Onco specialists, drug companies and anyone else with an interest are always keen to learn about dif ways of treating anything unusual. Which is great if it is to your advantage without compromising the normal treatment they use. So if you are offered to go on a trial make sure you read up on it and get as much info as you can, weigh up the pro's and con's so you can make the right choice for \"you\"   Around 25% of folks get asked about various trials as it is, so that figure may well be higher in your case. Oh, and don't worry yourself about Radiotherapy it's not as scary as it sounds. Lots of new members worry themselves silly about having rads only to find it was nowhere near as bad as they expected. Try not to fret too much, we know it's hard not to at the start but worrying won't change anything and only makes you feel worse -  and another big no-no is not to google anything. There is a helluva lot of outdated and wrong information out there, so stick with Macmillan and breastcancercare uk. If you need more info phone the 0808 number on every Macmillan webpage - The Maccy nurses are brilliant.  Take care G  n'  J ",

      "Content": "Hiya, At 44 your breast tissue will still be quite dense that is why it's harder to get accurate mammograms and more difficult to feel anything.  Sounds like they are going to see if the chemo will shrink it down (which in most cases it does) so you can have a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy. You won't get any further grading / type results until after any removed tissue is examined in the path lab. This is standard practice so don't have any fears about not being told much as yet. It's just some have surgery before chemo and get these results quicker. The ct / mri scans are also standard it gives them more information so they can tailor your treatment later on specifically to you so get used to them as you may be given several scans of various types during the course of any treatments. So basically you are special (to your family and us here) but will get the same sorts of treatment regime as the rest of us with just a few personal tweaks because as yet you don't know if you will be ER/PR (oestrogen and progesterone) positive or HER2 positive which means more treatment tweaks but all do'able. Just concentrate on this in one step at a time for now, don't let this affect your family Christmas. Have a great day tomorrow, G n' J",

Pleased to read it seems to like you well apart from the dry throat. Are you drinking plenty of fluids (at least 2 litres a day) ? Do keep an eye on your throat as oral thrush can be a chemo side effect - the steroids they give you can wipe out your mouths good bacteria which normally keeps your mouth and throat healthy. There is a regular monthly chemo club in the breast group where those on chemo chat about experiences and exchange tips to ease any side effects - you can find Octobers Chemo Club clicking here. Novembers will be up and running by Tuesday. Chemo is a weird beast most find their first session is the worst as it comes a shock to the system but others find the sessions cumulative so they gradually get more tired or achey.  If you haven't been it may help you to keep a chemo diary, not only for all the appointment times but it's a reminder of how the chemo affected you day by day so you know what to expect and when next time around and a good reference to go back to if you need any specific info at a later date.

It can become a problem as a lot more often get the drippy nose thing but it's only when you go to wipe or blow you realise this time it's red. It's down to a few factors - the lack of nasal hair, vulnerable capillaries from chemo and Herceptin reducing your platelet count so your blood doesn't clot as easily. You could also get bruising more easily due to a drop in platelets \u2013 bleeding gums after brushing your teeth, or lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs known as petechia. You can always try making some cash out of the deal by saying it's a cross between Red Nose Day and Movember  :-)  Jackie still gets a slight nose bleed now, well over a year since finishing Herceptin.

J's oncologist said the only local Dexa scan machine was in a private hospital and our GP would do an NHS referral for her scans. This is exactly how it came about. You may be luckier if your hospital is a larger unit with a Dexa scanner on site. DEXA (scan)  Dual Energy X-ray NHS link. Scan to check bone density for thinning and/or osteoporosis caused by some hormone tablet therapies. This not the same as the bone scan performed at a nuclear radiology dept. G n' J",

      "Content": "Hiya Lou, Any Chemo / Herceptin isn't usually started until around 4 weeks post surgery so you have some time to let the diagnosis dust settle before checking that part of this Runaway Mine Cart Ride out. The mastectomy is more scary in your head than in reality - The emotional side of losing a boob can take longer to adjust to but at the moment it's slowly trying to kill you so it's better gone :-( Sorry to be a bit blunt but it's better to be honest.... It's been caught early and everything is in your favour. BC has a very high recovery rate currently around 90% and most of the other 10% have other ill health treatment issues or the cancer was found when already quite advanced. You mention checking your lymph nodes during surgery - This is called SNB (sentinel node biopsy)  They inject you with a blue tracer dye and track the dye back through the lymphnodes and remove the 2 or 3 nodes small nearest the tumour. As yours is early they may well be clear but if not you will be called back to have more possibly all removed for them to double check them. It is not unusual for there to be a few cells trapped in the nearest node, it is what they are there for (trapping infection) so do not get alarmed if this is the case. You could have a read of this 'Your Operation and Recovery' while you get to meet us all to give you an idea of what to expect. As for reconstruction, there is detailed info within Macmillan about the various types but you need to ask if you will be having radiotherapy at a later date - recon's can be carried out at the same time as mastectomy but radiotherapy can damage the recon tissue depending on which type of recon you go for. Some surgeons will not do an immediate recon because of this and make you wait until any rads are complete - you need to ask your surgeon his views on this and check it out with your breast nurse too for her views. They are a brilliant group of ladies here and we all help each other through whatever stage you are at. There's always someone here having the same treatment at the same time. Best wishes, G n' J",

There are loads of us here who were diagnosed and have already had all treatments from 2012 and some many years before then. This is not the widowmaker it was considered ten years ago and has a very high recovery rate with the very best of modern treatments. No doubt you are worried sick, this is all unknown ground to you but please don't torture yourself unnecessarily it isn't worth the grief, and this blip isn't worth spoiling your Christmas over honestly. BCC produces a booklet about Paget's Disease which you can read by clicking the green link.

      "Content": "Morning Forza  So sorry to read about your father in law and seeing you having to join us here. How unlucky is he, one of only around 500 men a year in the UK diagnosed with breast cancer, it's triple negative and signet cell too :( There have been a few fella's with breast cancer here but they have completed treatment and moved on although if any still keep an eye on the group and notice your message may reply. The treatments are basically the same as for women so being triple negative this could mean, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, although not always in that order. Signet cell cancer is a rare type of cancer found most often in the glandular cells lining the stomach. But it can also develop in the bowel, breast, pancreas, bladder, prostate or lung. It also has a tendency to spread to the lymph nodes more quickly than other breast cancer types so this would explain the 38/44 score. You can find more information about Breast Cancer in Men - Just click the cover image. You can either read it online or download and save it for reference. If you would like more of an insight into Signet Cell Breast Cancer select this link. It refers to women but the info is identical as the chances of another man finding themselves in the same position as your father in law is so very uncommon. Hope this is of some help for now to get your head around all this, do keep posting if you have more questions or worries and keep a look out for the December Chemo Club discussion where you can get support and tips to help with the FEC-T chemo.

It is a very active group where you can come to scream, cry and ease your worries - we even manage to have a few laughs along the way. No doubt your head is full of questions and worries at the moment. It's early days and the waiting for results is terrible on the emotions and everyone here hated being at the stage you are at now. Mammograms are not as accurate as ultrasound scans for younger women as the breast tissue is a lot denser - Hence why you were really squashed during yours. You almost certainly will have some biopsies taken so please be aware of this. Which can leave you a bit sore for a few days afterwards. Please understand that if your fears are confirmed BC has one of the highest recovery rates of any cancers almost 90% so don't have fears for the future. The treatment can be tough but is do'able. You may find this a good read 'Understanding Breast Screening' just click the green text link. It covers just about everything relating to screening. No doubt you will get lots of reassuring replies from the other lovely ladies here so I'll just leave you with a little advice. Please don't Google too much. A lot of the information out there is way out of date, or misleadingly wrong. Stick with reputable web sites like Macmillan and Breast Cancer Care UK If you have any questions at all however silly you may think they are, just holler there is always someone around here to help you.

As for your four year old there is a book titled 'Mummy's Lump' you can view and download to read with her. Just click the title to check if you think it is suitable for her. If it's of any help there is a support website for teenagers who have a parent with diagnosed with cancer called Rip Rap you can take a look by clicking the link to see if you think she may get some help from it ?

      "Content": "Evening Lucy, Sorry to see you joining the club no one wants to be in. Breast cancer is very treatable it's one of the more common types and has had more research than practically any other which is good because there are so many varied treatment options. There are loads of women here who have had treatment and are now classed as NED (no evidence of disease) They will never say you are clear but in around 90% of cases you come through it all to enjoy your new life. Jackie (my wife) was diagnosed stage 3 in May 2012 and although the treatment isn't a walk in the park, it is do'able.  It's hard to say try not to worry or panic as it won't make any difference to your results but that is a big ask early on waiting for diagnosis info. Once your treatment plan is in place everything happens so fast. Some have chemo before surgery, others surgery then chemo. Others who are luckier have surgery and radiotherapy with no chemo. Everyone is different and they tailor your regime to you and your specific tumour. No doubt you will have loads of questions, so just post away we are all here to help you through this with friendly advice and support. Best wishes for good luck tomorrow, do keep us informed.

      "Content": "Hi DL   Sorry to see you are having Taxotere / Docetaxel issues so early on :( Pineapple juice could help as would pineapple chunks from the fridge, be careful with pineapple though if you mouth gets sore from mouth ulcers (another common side effect with T) The oral thrush meds should hopefully start to clear that up, but a bit more of a concern is the soles of your feet being sore as this could be a sign of Peripheral Nuropathy (info link) which can be induced by some chemotherapy drugs; Taxotere being one of them.  Are your fingers starting to get sore as well, or just the nails for now ? You should contact your Onco Unit and tell them about this pain/soreness in hands / feet - it may be the dose of Taxotere is a tad too high for you and they can reduce the dosage by 20% for your other sessions as this can get progressively worse even leading to the skin on your feet cracking or peeling skin making walking and stairs a nightmare :( A 20% reduction is sometimes enough to ease the problem. Something which may help for now is to cut down on anything that causes friction like footwear that is too tight, gripping/screwing actions when unscrewing bottle and jar tops etc Vitamin B12 is supposed to help and be careful with water that may be hotter than you think it is as the nerves in your hands and feet may be slightly numb. Swapping your Co-Codamol for and non-steroidal anti inflammatory like Ibuprofen may be a better option as this can help with nerve pain. Please get this checked out as PN can take ages to recover from post chemo, my wife still has slightly numb big toes from 2012 Hope this helps a bit, take care, G n' J",

Nerve damage repairing itself after surgery can feel weird and can be anything from feeling hot, cold, little zap type shocks and even feel like it is wet ? It can take a while for breast / armpit nerves to settle down after being disturbed. Good luck with your results, hopefully the node check will come back clear so you won't need any others removed. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Kimbeeloo  Warm welcome to the group.... I don't know if you have underlying health problems that make chemo a risky scenario, but do be mindful to read up and info grab HER2+ Positive (link) before thinking about ducking out of chemo... Around 15% of those with BC will be found to be HER2+    Ten years ago HER2+ positive was considered to be one of the more agrressive types of breast cancer get diagnosed with a higher % chance of recurrence either locally or as a secondary cancer within 5-10 years - The biological targeted therapy Herceptin was introduced and changed all that and is a real game changer for HER2+ BC but to get the Herceptin it has to be given alongside chemotherapy, you cannot have it on it's own. Even better now the newer Perjeta can be included as well. My wife was HER2+ back in May 2012 when Herceptin was still quite new and was the original postcode lottery drug - she was still no evidence of disease at her 6 year review and it is scary to think that without chemo and herceptin she may not have made it this far :-/ Know it is tough when you are told you will only need radiotherapy and possibly 5 years of tablets only to get hit later on with the you need chemo news. There probably isn't much info out there from those who are HER2+ and refuse chemo/herceptin as given the option most find the odds are too high to risk it :( Probably not what you wanted to hear but you need facts to make an informed decision and sugar coating 'stuff' isn't always the best option.

      "Content": "Hi tarneh  The only daft question is the one that isn't asked  :) Noticed you are taking Tamoxifen - Your friend could be post menopause and is going to be taking either Letrozole, Anastrozole or Exemstane as her ovaries won't be producing the oestrogen? Those types of tablet can cause bone thinning which can lead to osteopaenia and a Dexa scan checks bone density to keep an eye on this. They perform the first scan before starting the tablets to get base line figures, then again after 6 months or so to see if they are causing any bone density change. You don't get this problem with Tamoxifen so unless they change you to those mentioned above in a couple of years (which they sometimes do) it isn't a concern :) Hope this help, G n' J",

You should contact your chemo unit about the white tongue, as it sounds like an Oral Thrush type yeast infection. There are several meds they can give you to help with this - If you leave it it can eventually cover the throat too and can lead to mouth ulcers :( You will normally feel a little like yourself around day 10'ish with Mr. T (tax) Have a look through the back pages in the September Chemo Club here - to see if it is mentioned there.

      "Content": "Evening tarneh  Oncologists have an odd opinion of menopause. Some wait until at least 6 months plus without a period in case you are what they term peri-menopausal (an inbetweeny) - others accept that treatments will push you into the menopause meaning they all have varying ways of doing things. If there is the chance your ovaries are still producing some oestrogen tamoxifen is the better one, post menopause most oestrogen is made by the adrenal glands and some from body fat cells. Perhaps they have recommended she has a Dexa scan for some other reason but still related to bone density or is she taking other meds to 'switch off' her ovaries ? Get her to ask and compare notes :) Even minor differences in diagnosis can cause a change in treatments, and everyone's breast cancer is slightly different. Take care, G n' J",

More confused now than before ? - I'm not surprised  :-) Grading = Cancers are graded according to how different they are to normal breast cells and how quickly they are growing. In your pathology report this may be called differentiation. There are three grades of invasive breast cancer:     \u2022    grade 1 (well differentiated) the cancer cells look most like normal cells \u2013 for example, they are of similar size and shape to normal cells \u2013 and are usually slow-growing     \u2022    grade 2 (moderately differentiated) the cancer cells look less like normal cells \u2013 they are often larger and show variation in size and shape \u2013 and are growing faster     \u2022    grade 3 (poorly differentiated) the cancer cells look most changed and are usually fast-growing. With ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) there also three grades, but these are usually called low, intermediate and high instead of 1, 2 or 3. Treatment options People with grade 3 invasive breast cancers are more likely to be offered chemotherapy to help destroy any cancer cells that may have spread as a result of the cancer being faster growing.

      "Content": "Afternoon Jo, Sorry about the reply delay, we had to go into town for the weekly shop :-( Seeing as you were given nothing in writing you need to start off getting all the info you can about your diagnosis because everything from here on hinges on those facts and figures. Firstly stage and grade then lymph node involvement (sounds very much like none) which is good. The biopsy may have been grade 1 but that sometimes gets upgraded to a 2 from the pathology dept's more thorough checks. Lower the stage number the slower the cells grow. The surgery has removed the cancer and with clear margins, so everything you are being given now is to help avoid against any re-occurance. As they hinted you are hormone receptive you will need to know if you are either ER+ (oestrogen) and /or PR+ (progesterone) receptor positive - you could be one, both or neither. There is also a scoring system for how receptive but a lot don't pass on this info, they just say positive or negative not mentioning if this is strongly receptive or not.  If positive you will  be given aromatase hormone inhibitor tablets, you can be on these for five sometimes ten years. Depends on which type of tablet you are being given and that depends on if you are pre or post menopausal and a few other factors. There are about four different types you can read about those here. If pre menopausal the tablets are different because your ovaries will be producing oestrogen too. I would have thought if you were HER2+ someone would have mentioned it as the treatment for this is Herceptin which is given for HER2+ results - this is usually 18 x 3 weekly sessions but it is given with chemotherapy so if you are not having chemo then you will be HER2 negative. You can ask just to see what they say about it ? So, onto the radiotherapy - The usual regime for this is 15 sessions mon-fri x 3 weeks. They give you a break over the weekends. The first appointment is what they call assessment and planning and is usually one week or thereabouts before treatment starts. You will have a question and answer this is your chance to ask about anything rads related before your sessions start. At this planning appt they will show you the room and get you on the linear accelerator table and measure you up very precisely for the exact area needing treatment - they will then give you some very small pin point black tattoo marks. These are used to line you up at each session to avoid having o go through all the measuring again. For most the worst part of rads is the daily travelling and what feels like sunburn.  Most radiotherapy patients get free parking but you can ask about that at the assessment later on. Hope this helps a bit, fingers crossed you'll get some more replies mentioning anything I have missed out :-) G n' J",

      "Content": "Morning Kimbeeloo  Warm welcome to the group.... I don't know if you have underlying health problems that make chemo a risky scenario, but do be mindful to read up and info grab HER2+ Positive (link) before thinking about ducking out of chemo... Around 15% of those with BC will be found to be HER2+    Ten years ago HER2+ positive was considered to be one of the more agrressive types of breast cancer get diagnosed with a higher % chance of recurrence either locally or as a secondary cancer within 5-10 years - The biological targeted therapy Herceptin was introduced and changed all that and is a real game changer for HER2+ BC but to get the Herceptin it has to be given alongside chemotherapy, you cannot have it on it's own. Even better now the newer Perjeta can be included as well. My wife was HER2+ back in May 2012 when Herceptin was still quite new and was the original postcode lottery drug - she was still no evidence of disease at her 6 year review and it is scary to think that without chemo and herceptin she may not have made it this far :-/ Know it is tough when you are told you will only need radiotherapy and possibly 5 years of tablets only to get hit later on with the you need chemo news. There probably isn't much info out there from those who are HER2+ and refuse chemo/herceptin as given the option most find the odds are too high to risk it :( Probably not what you wanted to hear but you need facts to make an informed decision and sugar coating 'stuff' isn't always the best option. Take care, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi bloojools  Peanut11 Depends on what LVEF figure was given at your last Muga or ECG scan ? The pressure of blood being ejected from the lower left side chamber. A normal LVEF (lower ventricular ejection fraction) figure is only between 55% and 75% anyway so if your normal figure is at the lower range to start with, it doesn't give a lot of wriggle room; meaning quite a few ladies only have half or so of their 18 sessions as the cut off figure is mostly 50-51%    Below 50 and you are in heart attack risk territory. If your figure is starting to drop a couple of weeks break can see the figure rise back up a few % to resume Herceptin but if it doesn't you will be taken off it because if the heart gets damaged it can be permanent. Lowering your salt intake can help raise the lvef figure a little. What figure was quoted at your last check ?  J had a 2 week break after about 6 herceptin as her lvef dropped to 51% (it was 64% at the start) and was given an ACE inhibitor - after the break it went back up to 55% and stayed at that level for all the other sessions. As mentioned earlier NICE are going through the figures and data of the Herceptin (Persephone Trial) and will probably recommend that 9 sessions is just as effective and will replace the 18 sessions as standard practice, and at £1,200 per dose you can maybe see why. Hope this helps a bit, G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi  Lizzie,  I'm fairly certain that if you have, and are being treated for cancer, and even after treatment you are covered by what was the Disability Discrimination Act (now known as the Equality Act I think ) as you are regarded as being in remission so depending on the circumstances regarding your couple of days off, they may be legally wrong by pulling you up over it.  There is a whole shedload of information regarding coping with work issues on the Maccy site, with a menu on the left hand side of the page, I'll paste in the link below...... As for the Tamoxifen it affects everyone differently, like all of these hormone tabs they do come with baggage, some seem to suffer a lot worse than others and 5 years is a long time to be suffering. Dunno about the immune system, but why not, they seem to effect everything else.  Do have a word with the lovely Maccy nurses on the 0808 number, maybe they will advise you to contact your Onco Dr to see if there is an alternative tablet you could try if only to see if the different side effects from that are easier for you to cope with ? The pasted text below is taken from Macmillan's equality act leaflet. \"What are reasonable adjustments for disabled people\" ? Employers have a duty to make \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019 to workplaces and working practices to ensure that people with a disability are not at a disadvantage compared to others. There is no fixed definition of \u2018reasonable\u2019. What is reasonable will depend on all the circumstances, including practicality, cost, and the extent to which business may be disrupted. Any planned adjustments should be discussed with, and approved by, the employee concerned. Reasonable adjustments for someone with cancer might include: \u2022 letting them take time off to attend medical appointments \u2022 modifying a job description to remove tasks that cause particular difficulty \u2013 either on a temporary or permanent basis \u2022 being flexible around working hours, or offering the option to work from home \u2022 allowing extra breaks to help them cope with fatigue \u2022 adjusting performance targets to take into account the effect of sick leave/fatigue etc on the employee, or giving them a post with more suitable duties \u2022 moving a work station, for example to avoid stairs \u2022 ensuring easy access to premises for someone who is using a wheelchair or crutches \u2022 providing disabled toilet facilities \u2022 allowing a gradual, phased return to work after extended sick leave \u2022 changing the date or time of a job interview if it coincides with a medical appointment. Just one or two little changes could be all it takes to help an employee stay in work.

I firmly believe they saved her life. Back in 2012 there was no Perjeta and Herceptin was given slowly using the same pump and bag delivery method as chemo over a 40 minute period. Giving that way the only side effects were a bit of a runny nose and the occcasional very minor nose bleed. It was only when they introduced the sub-cut injection method patients started noticing hip, upper leg and pelvic aches. So in our minds slower and being more at room temp helped.  Letrozole on the other hand is a force to be reckoned with. J finished her 5 years on Letrozole in June (hooray) although she was lucky enough to be on Femara they were still buggers for bone / joint aches.  She used to take Meloxicam NSAID (non-steroidal anti inflammatorry drug) and Amitriptyline to help ease the aches and now letrozole has left the party she hasn't needed those now. A lot of people underestimate Letrozole and think it is just another Tamoxifen looky-likey but it is given to some patients to actually shrink tumours down prior to surgery if for whatever reason they cannot be given chemo - so, a tough little cookie. If you are not taking any anti-ache meds and don't mind adding to your bag of Skittles see your GP for something to ease them. You don't get any medals for suffering  :) Take Care, G n' J",

So you have had a lumpectomy (WLE) Assume you had your results appointment by now where they tell you about what they found from the tissue in pathology regarding stage / grade if any lymph nodes were affected etc ?  Are you ER, PR or HER2+ (positive) or do you not know yet ? Notice you don't mention chemo... Did you have this before surgery or do you not need it / or are having it next ? If you are to be given chemo they will discuss this as the next step as chemo is usally given before radiotherapy but if you have dodged the chemo bullet your next appointment will be to check your surgery for any problems like healing ok, no seroma or lymphoedema check for scar tissue forming checking for any other problems.  Then it will lead onto discussing your radiotherapy sessions. If you can let us have some more details it would help us compile a few questions you could ask, but we don't want to explain all about rads if your next stage is going to be chemo. Sorry to be a bit vague - we'll get back to you when we know where you are on the roller coaster. Take care, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Yay, Nice to see you made it over the fence to come and say Hi! Katie. Are you starting FEC on Tuesday or something else ? Just wondering as most have fec-t but there are other chemo combo's and they all behave a little differently. How on earth you and your sister are going to help and support each other when both suffering from chemo brain - sounds more like a script for a comedy series..... Neither of you will remember where anything is and your conversations will be like listening to Yoda  lol. Seriously though you have had some great advice but some of the side effects your sister is having / had may not be the same as yours even if you are on the same chemo drugs as they do seem to have a mind of their own and you just won't know how it will treat you until you have had the first one. A few like hair loss, whole body tiredness, mouth ulcers, oral thrush, bone muscle aches, constipation or the opposite can be common others seem really random like dry eyes, losing some finger and/ or toenails etc - So be prepared for anything. Take all your steroids and anti sickness tablets even if you feel ok. Try and work the times out so you don't take the steroids after 4pm if you can as the later you take it the more chance there is you will have trouble getting to sleep. They can also give you the munchies and you'll want to nibble snacks all the time. They are always given with chemo along with the anti sickness tablets they do help with the side effects a bit so keep taking them even if you feel fine because if you are sick it will be too late to take them and keep them down. It may help if you get some mouthwash with Chlorhexidine in, if not from the onco unit get some Corsodyl from a pharmacy because mouth ulcers and oral thrush are quite common with chemo. If this happens and your sense of taste goes weird try a bit of pineapple or a ginger nut biscuit before you eat to give your taste buds a kick. Grab a couple of tins of Pineapple chunks and juice or ginger beer too. You can fridge or freeze the chunks on cocktail sticks - they help with the furry tongue and gunky mouth feeling which also helps your taste buds.  Get some other pain relief that doesn't contain any paracetamol so you can alternate tablets 2 hourly and not overdose on paracetamol until the chemo headache or other aches and twinges subside. Another couple of items to put on your list is a soft toothbrush for sore gums in case of above and a thermometer to keep an eye out for temp spikes (signs of infection) when white count is low. Do use the thermometer first thing in the morning before you have taken any paracetamol first or you'll get a false lower reading. If your temp reaches 37.5 or higher phone the onco unit as it could be a sign of infection when your white count is low (days 7-14 middle week)   It may help you to keep a treatment diary so you can keep track of how you feel day by day and note your temps and appts in. Any probs or other Q's you need answering, fire away. We're all here to help and only a couple of clicks away. Hugs to you and Big Sis, take care, George & Jackie",

      "Content": "Morning Gina, Really feel for you this has been such a long wait and it isn't over yet :-( A lot here only have a 2-3 week wait between getting a diagnosis confirmed and either chemo or surgery being started. The extra time you are having to endure playing this waiting game is emotionally cruel - It gives you way too much thinking time and there's no real way of escaping that. You can shove it to the back of your mind while you are busy but it keeps rearing it's head as soon as you get a free moment when you could relax :-( You say you have to be strong (why?) and can't let folks know you are terrified, but you can let on how scary this is for you without causing too much alarm within the family. You need more support than you are letting them give you by trying to be strong all the time, it bubbles over and causes panic attacks and major teary spells and makes you feel cr*p. Don't look at all those days left on the calender, take the wait one day at a time mark them off with a big cross you'll soon find you only have a couple of days to go, then the surgery anguish starts but everyone here will tell you all their surgery fears were unfounded, a lot are well enough to come home after a mastectomy the next day. You're doing great honestly - everything you are feeling is totally normal. It's just a bummer it has to be that way. Hugs, G n' J",

      "Content": "Evening Forever Lucky, Does it feel warm like you could have an infection starting ? This certainly doesn't sound or look right if it's starting to ooze a bit, and obviously you don't think it does either.... I would start taking the antibios, they won't do you any harm if it isn't an infection but if it is the start of one it will keep it in check until you can get your gp or onco to have another look seeing as you say it is worse now than when your onco checked it. If you have a thermometer keep an eye on your temp regularly and if it gets to 37.5 or any higher ring the unit. Are you still on chemo ? Fingers crossed it will be ok, but if you don't take the tablets you could end up in hosp on antibio drips for 3 days or so if it takes hold. Take care, George & Jackie",

Fraud ? what after all you have been through - you sound more like wonder woman to us :-) G n' J",

      "Content": "Hi Ajem, Welcome to the breast group - Must admit after reading your profile I thought you had posted in the wrong group..... Great to read your husband is doing well, he certainly went through it fairly. When you say radium I assume you mean radiotherapy - Like as in possibly 15 daily sessions over 3 weeks (mon-fri) ? The side effects are different so as far as I know there is no reason why you cannot start the hormone inhibitor tablets straight away (which tablets are they) as there are 4 main types.... The side effects from radiotherapy are mostly tiredness (all the daily traveling doesn't help) and slight sunburn effects but is very do'able. Think you'll find most here were well into any hormone therapy prior to rads and it made no difference. Hope this helps, do reply with more questions, you must have several floating around ? Take care, G n' J",
