    "Content": "I recently read that 'oncologists' as a group, were the least likely of any professions, to accept chemotherapy as a treatment for their cancer. Makes you think doesn't it? I've been extremely fortunate not to be touched personally by this dreaded illness, ecept through Loved ones, and family that contracted it, and haven't posted here in a long time, but I stay because of the wonderful people here, the patients and their families, nurses and doctors who have 'been there, and have done that'.  I've always felt that any patient should have the right to decide on their own treatment, but it should be an informed decision. And who is better informed on these things than oncologists? God bless and good luck!  ",
