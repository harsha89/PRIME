    "Content": "My aunt has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. She has had 3 chemo sessions so far and has been doing ok. Today she had a scan to see if it has shrunk. She was told that it had not shrunk and had started to break up but the doctor couldn't confirm anything and we have to wait to speak to the speciallist. I was wondering if anyone has been through the same sort of thing. I know each case is different but any input would be great because the last time we were in this situation was with my nan and when her cancer started to break up it was because it was spreading.",
