    "Content": "Hi, In my experience you have to fight for everything when it comes to treatment, results or just information.  When I went for my results I saw a Registrar, didn't introduce himself, knew nothing about my history and was very unsympathetic.   I went home, had a good cry, shook myself off and rang the breast care nurse asking what I could do about it.  When I went for the results of my CT scan I asked to see the Consultant and see him I did. He was lovely, totally different, so kind and caring and spent loads of time with me. If you are unhappy then please take it up with a contact you have at the Breast Clinic, you need to be happy when you are discharged and in my opinion it should be the consultant that actually discharges you.  Stand your ground, its your right and you need to be happy with what you have been told and the way you have been left. They don't always like you standing up for your rights but you only get one life and if it was a member of their family............ Take care and hope it all works out for you. xx ",
