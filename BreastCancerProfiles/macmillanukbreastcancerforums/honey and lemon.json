      "Content": "Bless you. My heart went out to your circumstances. You are breastfeeding and your lump is probably related to that. However your GP is being cautious in referring you. The 2 week wait is the norm for this type of referral. That \"waiting game\" is horrible and your thoughts and emotions are natural. Speaking to others with a sympathetic ear or writing your thoughts and feelings down will help too. I hope everything turns out with good news.",

      "Content": "Hi Winky49, I had a Dexa Scan a few years ago before i had breast cancer. I had chronic back pain for many years and my GP ordered it. It was a few weeks before the results. They found I had osteopenia which is a precursor to Oesteoporosis. Its treated with a weekly tablet Alendronic Acid.  My oncologist added Calcium/VitD tablets when I got  cancer. Your Oncologist will favor this treatment in addition to any  other cancer treatment. Hope helpful.",

      "Content": "Hi, I prepared for \"likely hair loss\" by having mine cut short. before I started chemo. So glad I did.  Day 14 after 1st chemo I noticed it on my pillow then after shower/hairwash loads came out in the bath. Worst scenario I did my back in cleaning the bath !! My lovely hairdresser says she will come to my home and take it all off.  Some members suggest not shaving right off as the prickles can make scalp more irritating so I might go close but leave some ends.  Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon, My hair started coming out last week. It was on my pillow then moreso in the shower. What a mess to clear up and then I got back pain after clearing it up !!  My lovely hairdresser, having already cut mine short in preparation came round my house and shaved it all off.  Laughing,  I looked like Harry Hill. But so pleased with result. I have a lovely shaped head and scalp and enjoying trying out scarves, hats and wigs lent to me by a dear friend who has been on the same journey. Intially its a shock but you soon adjust and will appreciate the practicality of no hair. best wishes.",
