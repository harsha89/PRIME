    "Content": "Hi girls hope you don't mind me popping over from the uterine site but find your thread interesting. My endometrial cancer was found in a pelvic lymph node and I had lot of conflicting advise on adjuvent treatment. In the end I declined it because i also have Â malignant melanoma. A copy of my oncs letter to my surgeon said I'd declined chemo but in any case the benefit would be small 8%. He also said my tumour was hormone sensitive and treatment would give me 10%, but that it carried a 10% cardio risk which cancelled out benefit. I was never told those percentages at hospital visits and wonder why they are so keen to promote them for such little benefit.",
