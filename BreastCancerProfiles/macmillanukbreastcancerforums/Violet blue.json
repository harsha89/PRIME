But to be honest he said we can't rule out chemo just yet. Fortunately I do have a rough timescale of how my cancer had developed. I had a mammogram Aug 2015 so this has developed over 16 months ish. So I'm thinking even if I do have to wait maybe three months, is that going to make a dramatic difference? Kerry xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn, Thanks for your reply. So this is my situation. I have a mix of dcis and stage 2 invasive ductual cancer. They can't tell me how much I have if each. It could be mostly one or the other. I have two areas in my breast with quite a big gap so my consultant said a lumpectomy may be the best option. Because of the pre cancer he said chemo would not get rid of this, and felt that my true cancer could be very small, so may put myself through chemo when it may not be necessary. I thought if I could avoid chemo it would be best. So it puts me in a position for a full mastectomy without any treatment so far. I hope I've explained it well enough? I think there is a high possibility of rads after they look at my breast but who knows. I might get lucky?!? I am awaiting a gene test as I have two maternal aunts who have had breast cancer.

      "Content": "Hi all,  I'd love some advice about what to do after I have my mastectomy. After being diagnosed mid December, and having multiple biopsies, my lymph glands are clear! Hurray!  I now need to be 100% sure which surgery I'm going to go with. I can have my mastectomy and full deip/from my back reconstruction, or, have an expander implant and then later have my reconstruction. The risk of having a big op is longer recovery and waiting time if I need chemo or rads. Also if I do have rads it could damage the new breast. If I opt for the implant, it will save as much of my breast tissue to use for the proper reconstruction. But means I'd face two ops instead of one. I'm totally confused now, I had it fixed in my head that I'd do the whole thing in one go, but now I'm not sure. Am I being stupid to delay any possible treatment because I don't want two ops? The whole point is to be cancer free whatever it takes right? So am I gambling that?  Any experience, opinions, thoughts would be great. I've listened to my surgeon, my family, my breast care nurse. Now I think I'd really benefit from some first hand experiences. Kerry xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, im coming up to my last cycle of chemo, yippee, and have started to think about the next step in my treatment which will be tamoxifen. Currently I'm feeling particularly low about my appearance. I had a mastectomy and recon prior to chemo so I'm still coming to terms with my body. I've put on a lot of weight during treatment and hair loss had been much tougher than I thought it would be. Basically I'm really looking forward to getting back to how I was before all this started. However, after reading about some of the side effects of tam, it sounds like that won't happen. After surgery I had an oncotype test and it came back as 20. I really resented having chemo and how it made me feel. So to now think I may have to take a drug that makes me feel bad too makes me feel angry. I know I'm luckier than most and these are life saving treatments, but I've found the last six months incredibly difficult. Do I say no to tam and take the risk? I'm 38 and I know that I should see it as investing in my future. But I want my life and my body back, instead of pumping it full of more drugs. Am I taking the list of side effects too seriously? I'm sure everyone is different, but it's really depressing reading. Kerry xx",

To me it felt like a hard section that was different from the rest of my boob. But I had clear liquid coming from the nipple. In Aug 2015 I went to the breast clinic with a tiny cyst on the tip of said nipple. It was fine so when  discharge started coming out, I didn't panic, in fact stupidly I ignored it! But that that one symptom probably saved me from discovering it much much later. My advice to you is just go to your gp and get a referral. You know your breast better than anyone. It will give you peace of mind. I hope though that its nothing, its better to be cautious than find it too late. Good Luck! Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I really need the mother of all rants and this is the safest place to do it. So that it's off my chest and out in the world.  I had my last chemo over a week ago. I thought I'd be cartwheeling down the street and feeling on top of the world! But no, quite the opposite. I feel real anger, and it's at everything. But particularly at the moment it's at a recent stay in hospital. I went in with a high temp, sore throat, bad chest. It's the second time this has happened to me. I hated the first and wanted to do anything to avoid it. But I knew I had to. They gave fluids and antibiotics and because I had to have those horrid injections to boost my white cell count, I needed co codamol for the pain. But with co codamol brings constipation. So I asked for some laxatives. Sure we just need to get a doc to prescribe it. Okay, then nothing. Ask again and again and again. So today I was doubled up in the ward toilet having the worst time. My bottom was in a right state and me in agony. If they had just listened and gave me what I needed I would have been much better. I could have looked after myself better at home. I'm home tonight and have endured another really painful experience. The same thing happened with cough medicine for some relief while swallowing. Asked for it three times before I was given some. Normally here I'd defend the staff and say how great they were, and its underfunding. But it felt like it was lack of care. One nurse tried to take blood from a vein in my thumb, as soon as the needle went in it was painful, so I asked her to remove it politely, she continued to jab it around until I cried out in pain. I knew where she would find a vein, but she ignored me. The next nurse did it straight away. I'm angry I've had chemo, I'm angry that I didn't do what I wanted to and to be swayed by stats and talk of an investment in my future. I will never know if chemo has made any difference to my life. This drop in the ocean of time  is rubbish. It's leaving a big black hole of hurt on my life. I feel battered and brow beaten. And not just because of the above, but because of all of it. I understand chemo saves lives and I'm not undervaluing it or the people who work for the NHS. But in my heart of hearts now I know I didn't need chemo. And I'm angry at the professionals that talked me into it.  I hope with time my anger fades and I don't end up a bitter old woman with one boob and a story to tell. I hate cancer, I read an article today with the depressing title that more people will get cancer than get married. If I thought it was an either or situation I'd have got married long ago. It basically says that cancer has become one of those inevitable milestones in life.... If you've got this far, thanks for reading!  And good luck on your cancer journey Kerry xx www.google.co.uk/.../cancer-common-marriage-wake-up-call-macmillan",

Getting to the halfway point is a great feeling, knowing that you\u2019re at the top of the mountain and the rest is the descent. Before chemo needles didn\u2019t phase me at all, but I really hate them now. I wish I\u2019d had a picc line put in, so if you\u2019re concerned about your veins maybe this would suit you.  You\u2019re right the nurse shouldn\u2019t have taken your blood pressure on your surgery side. I think it has something to do with the lymph nodes???? I had a nurse take blood from my surgery side despite me telling her, my veins were a bit rubbish from chemo so I think she decided just to do it in the other arm. I realised after I should\u2019ve insisted, but you assume they know best. Sometimes it does feel overwhelming and scary but you will be finished really soon. My advice is never worry about speaking up, if something feels odd or is difficult or painful just say.  Sending you lots of good luck for the rest of your treatment, you\u2019re doing great and it will be over soon.

I would never ask or want anyone to lose their hair. Isn't it funny those of us who have been through it probably wouldn't wish it in their worst enemy. However our loved ones see it as a token of solidarity. I think you're right to start this discussion, and I do hope Macmillan listen. Losing my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes has been a really awful experience. Trying to get on with wearing a wig, false lashes and drawn on eyebrows, has left me looking at a sad stranger in the mirror. To be honest, I actually feel better going out without. If people stare, I'd rather they stared at my bald head and not half an eyelash falling off or a ill fitting wig. But I do have to mention that I do love the 'life with cancer is still a life' campaign. It is very poignant for me at the moment, as I'm having chemo as a preventative treatment. Each round I want to give up because I have nothing to measure it by. I feel I have no quality of life. It reminds me to keep on living my life and not hide away. But I also feel like our loved ones are living with it too, so it kind of relates to them too. I guess it's trial and error, they can't get it right all of the time. But it's important to discuss it openly and not worry about criticising it just because the intention was good. Kerry x",

When I discussed it with the plastic surgeon he said I was a good candidate but wanted the anesthetist to see me and talk about the risks of being sedated 8 to 10 hrs. My consultant who did the mastectomy said he would support whichever treatment I wanted. He described it as the royals Royce treatment, it came at a higher price, but when it worked it worked really well. I just needed to go into it with my eyes wide open. Other than my weight I'm generally fit and healthy so she had no issue with it. My surgery went well and no complications. Obviously I'm not out of the woods but I'm up and about, moving around. I guess my only thing really is the extra weight makes mobility harder after surgery. E.g. Getting out of bed. The first time I moved from bed to chair I thought I was going to be sick! And moving back I had a little cry.  However, I'm glad I did it in one go, the thought of facing another big op down the line didn't appeal to me.  I've never had a c section so I'm not sure what that conversation would be. But I'm sure it's considered on an individual by individual basis. Good luck xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I've recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm 37, and after having various tests it appears that have two areas of my breast that need to be removed. My consultant talked me through my surgery options, and even before that appointment I felt that a mastectomy was the right choice for me.  But I'm scared, it's a big deal losing my breast. Absolutely reconstructive surgery is amazing, but it won't be the same. Can anyone share anything about how they made their decision, and if you had any regrets or anything you'd do differently. I know each case is different. I still feel young, my breasts make me feel feminine, now I'm having doubts if I'm making the right decision.  Any advice is welcome x",

I obviously know that I may need chemo and/or radiotherapy after my op, depending on what they find when they remove my breast. But I really don't want to have it.  I'm hoping they say i don't need it, but I think this might be wish thinking. Are you having chemo first or surgery? Also when were you diagnosed?  I haven't had children and I'm not even sure I would of have any in the future but I still would like the choice. What was the process you experienced with the fertility road? did you need to see a fertility consultant? I hadn't considered it until the nurse mentioned menopause. I can't imagine what it must feel like having a little one and coping with this news, I hope you've got great support around you. I feel too young to be dealing with this!  Let me know how get on, and good luck with your treatment. Kerry xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Clare, It took five weeks to get my test results back but it originally was supposed to be  two. I actually had an appointment with the oncologist at four weeks, only to be told they didn't have the result. I was really upset because I was really hoping for a low score and had got myself all worked up. I had several small areas of invasive bc, the largest of which was 5mm grade 3 no lymph node involvement er positive, her2 negative. My test results came back as 20, and I was advised to have chemo unfortunately. I think it was maybe down to the grade and my age too (I'm 38). It's like an insurance policy for the future, but I will really never know if it's going to pay off. But even before I was offered the test, my consultant had said he thought I should have Chemo. So if you were told that you probably wouldn't gain much from having it in the first place, the oncotype test will probably say the same. I think this test is excellent, and I'm sure it's reduced the number of people who have chemo. I can imagine there were a lot of people having treatment that probably didn't need to. Good luck Clare, I'm hoping you get a nice low result. Kerry x",

I hope you've had the worst of it and that the rest go without a hitch. When I  was diagnosed and knew part of my treatment was going to be chemo, I had visions of being this sort of Wonder Woman. Carrying on at work, training for a marathon, writing inspirational blogs about breast cancer......the reality for me has been quite different. In a nutshell me curled up on the sofa or bed trying to concentrate on some tv show on Netflix. I couldn't even comfort eat, one of my favourite things to do when I'm sad! You're not alone on the crying front either. I cry at home, in gp waiting rooms, yesterday in the hospital begging to go home. I feel like it's breaking me down.
