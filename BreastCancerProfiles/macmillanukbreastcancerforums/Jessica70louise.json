      "Content": "Hey looking to see if anyone has had the same or similar experience this post is for my mam. She was diagnosed with breast cancer March last year she had a lumpectomy and 3 nodes removed, chemo and radiotherapy finished in early December. Afterwards her breasts were as normal was it could be after a lumpectomy just a slight scar not one bigger or smaller than the other both stayed the same size but she had a mammogram in February and about 3 weeks later the breast had swollen 3-4 times the size of her 'untouched' breast, consultant said it was unusual as that breast would usually be smaller after the lumpectomy and said he could also feel another lump but doesn't think it's suspicious and sent her on her way. Now she's got 2 lumps in her armpit and a constant burning sensation shooting down to her arm and sore nodes in her groin and neck doctors have done bloods just waiting for the results but as for the lumps in her armpit the breast care nurse has said she'll have an appointment within 2 week. Obviously she's really anxious about all of this and just feels the consultant at the hospital makes out she's overreacting etc she has had to take the rest of the week off work due it the strain of it all. Sorry for rambling on I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has gone through this or can shed some light on what more she can do. Thank you for reading and I'll pass any messages on to my mam her name is Jacqueline",

      "Content": "ANOTHER UPDATE: wednesday night my mam was in absolute agony and passed out after pulling her back so we went to a and e on Thursday morning after she's told them everything and done a few obs they took her for a MRI for it to come back that the cancer has actually spread to her spine and possibly other areas which we will find out on Monday when she has her CT scan (obviously they've changed the date now) she's been kept in hospital to try and get the pain under control but the oncologist has said the only treatment will be palliative care",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies her bloods came back as satisfactory she has seen her consultant today and he has confirmed he can feel a 4cm lump and is sending her for an ultrasound said it could be an infection, swelling or that her cancer has came back hopefully it's something simple that can be treated with antibiotics.",

      "Content": "UPDATE : so she went for the ultrasound has 3 biopsys, seen the consultant today and it's breast cancer again they think it could of been in there since last year and overlooked since they removed the main lump and a few lymphnodes this is in the lymph node so she will be having a CT scan to see if it's spread anywhere else then will come the discussion of operation, I'm soo angry for my mam the consultant felt a small lump about 7weeks ago but said it was nothing to worry about and now it turns out to be cancer again 15 months after her first diagnosis and the fact everyone was brushing it under the carpet of what my mam was telling them.",
