      "Content": "I finished my chemo in May 15 and I am loving my chemo curls!  I am using more product on my hair than I have done previoulsy such as gel and gum.  My friends have likened my hair to Halle Berry! I do own GHD straightners but its still to short to do, but i have seen GHD's with smaller plates, perhaps work a try?",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I am new to this group, I am well down the line with my treatment having finished chemo in May and rads in July, due to get my 9th herceptin next week. I am also taking tamoxifen for good measure too. Everything is returning to the 'new normal' apart from nails and toenails, they have started cracking and lifting and look unsightly and are very sore. I knew this could be a side effect when I was on treatment but it's been months since I finished chemo. Can any one recommend supplements/treatments. Thanks in anticipation.",

      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed 1 Dec 14, so things are very raw for me at the moment, first anniversary etc. I had a mastectomy and my path results came back with two cancers in one breast, the first was a grade 1 and I now take tamoxifen, the other was a grade 3 for which I am still having herceptin. The oncologist used the word \"complicated\" which still terrifies me. Life is almost back to normal after chemo and rads, loving my crazy chemo curls!!",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief Nails are getting better, slowly getting back to normal! I have my first mammogram next week, feeling very surreal as a whole year has passed since my surgery. I was in the local Tesco earlier and Xmas songs were playing and I got quite emotional. I guess it's normal as I remember the fear I felt when I got my diagnosis right on top of Xmas. Onwards and upwards! Thanks for remembering xx",
