      "Content": "Hi Anne, I went through chemo, surgery and radiation therapy respectively. I continued working through chemo, although I was extremely irregular. It was also a particularly hectic time in my project. I felt that because I was putting in long hours at work during chemo, I got knackered badly. I have been off work since April and am not 100% sure if I am ready for long hours back at work. I really benefited from being away from work. Being away from work also gave me time to go to support centres and avail of their therapies and programs. Meeting other people helped me heal psychologically.  As Alison said, try to sleep whatever time of day or night it is and keep away from infections. My colleagues consciously stopped hugging or shaking hands with me so that they don't pass on the infection to me.  I have always been one of those ambitious people who are very career focused. I thought that I could hang in and continue working during treatment but my body revolted. The best thing was to listen to my body and take lots and lots of rest.  Take care",

      "Content": "Hi EmmsieD, I had gone for just a physical examination by the breast specialist. I think he sensed something sinister and asked me to stay back for ultrasound, biopsy and mammogram. I didn't have appointment for these tests. Before I left the hospital, the radiographer had given me a heads-up for cancer. She may have done so because I wanted to know what was going on.  If I knew that there was the possibility that I could be given a heads-up for cancer, I would have gone to the hospital with my husband. It would have been easier to hear that if he were with me.  Fingers crossed for you. ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in September 2012. I was 34. My ovaries were switched off using zoladex to minimise the damage that the treatment would cause to them. My periods stopped after the first dose of chemo and zoladex (last period in October 2012). Zoladex was discontinued in November 2013. I have been on tamoxifen for a year now and I don't menstruate.  My BCN says that some people get them back after tamoxifen is discontinued or even while they are on tamoxifen. Some don't get them back at all. I have no idea if they will come back or not. I guess this is one of the uncertainties that cancer has brought in our lives. :(",

      "Content": "Such a fantastic thread....I 'have to' pitch in :) Let's see - the few that come to my mind immediately are: I invited cancer on myself. (I was thankful that a lump removed earlier from my breast was benign. When the report came, I said - Thank you God, it was benign. So, the allegation was that I expected that cancer could happen to me and therefore I got it.) I should cover my head, otherwise my mum will get shocked when she sees me. (after the hair loss and when my mum was coming to see me for the first time after the diagnosis) I am fat.  I am fat (again!) - After all the chemo, surgey and rads and when I was struggling to get by every single day. and a few more very hurtful things that I can't fathom how people can say such stuff!",

      "Content": "Just want to share with all the lovely people on this website that my husband and I will be participating in the half-marathon (power walk) at Moonwalk, London on 10th May. I am sure that I will be knackered but it should be fun. This will be the first event that I will participate in after cancer, so fingers and toes crossed. We have also been able to raise GBP 1570 so far, which is a tiny gesture of giving back to the system that supported us during a very difficult time.  If you think you'd like to contribute to this cause, you can visit my fund raising page:  http://www.justgiving.com/The-Bankas Many thanks",

So, I will be sporting my T-shirt with the pink bra design on it.  Yes, I am really looking forward to the event. Some cake would be nice to celebrate when we complete the walk. :) Good luck to you and your son for your walk. :)",
