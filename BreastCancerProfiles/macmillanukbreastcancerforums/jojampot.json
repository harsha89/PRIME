      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this site & just wanted to reach out to see if anyone could help. I'm having Chemo for breast cancer, just had number 6 0f 8. As always I have the most awful chemical taste in my mouth, even water tastes vile. Eating is a chore & before cancer knocked on my door  I adored eating & love cooking with a passion. I try & ask at the hospital but just get a set response that everyone reacts differently. I thought at first the worst thing that could happen to me was that my hair had fallen out although devastating as that still is the feeling that all the food I eat is poison is even worse. Has anyone had the same problem or can offer any help I'd love to hear from you, thanks for listening, Jo x",

      "Content": "Hi ronstar, thank you for your reply, I thought it was just me as whenever I've mentioned it it just gets swept away & I feel as if I'm just having a winge. But surely if it's so bad it's stopping you eating & drinking properly it's important.  Water has been the worst for me too, I've gone through lots of bottled brands all tasting vile. I adore my food as a rule so I can't wait to get past this awful time in my life & eat lots & grow my hair down my back! Thanks again, take care, Jo x",

It has made my mouth feel so much better too...more normal. Thank you again for taking the time to help, hope all is going well for you on your road to recovery. Love Jo x",
