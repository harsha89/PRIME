      "Content": "Hi all i have seen my  oncologist  He told me if i have no treatment my survival rate over 10 years would be 90% if I have the radio and Tamoxifen it would increase to 92.5% which he has told me i have definiteley got to have.  If i have chemo my survival goes to 95%.  This was all shown on a bar graph on the computer. The big% was i green.  He said I didn't need to make a decission straight away about the chemo but it was my decission and to let him know by next Tusday.  When he went out of the room he said just remember the green line.  Ireally don't know what to do whether to to have the chemo or not.  Has any one else had to make this decission who can help me. please.  I am new to this i only joined an hour ago. regards kay.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Awen Thank you for your reply to making  a  decission on chemo.  I had the same thoughts as you if i didn't do it i might regret it later if it returns I found it very helpful what you had to say.  I hope you are now feeling better and I wish you all the best wishes for the future. regards Kay Power",
