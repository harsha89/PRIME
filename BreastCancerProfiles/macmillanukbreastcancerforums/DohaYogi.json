      "Content": "Hi maggiemee  Upfront I am not an expert - I just made the following decisions for me based on my research.   There is a lot of research being done on Fasting and Keto during cancer treatments.  There are also threads on cancer sites regarding this topic though not so many in the UK - a lot in Europe, Canada and US - so you could research outer countries and speak to people who have undertaken this approach - of course your oncologist would need to approve  - and like so many things with cancer it is a personal choice.  I finished radiotherapy last week and made the decision today not to go ahead with chemo as medium risk based on my oncotype report (so my decision) but I was planning to fast based on my research and my oncologist and nutritionist were in support of me fasting and I had been preparing my body.  Since being Diagnosed I fast for 18 hours between my last and first meals 5 days a week (I have been able to work and exercise daily throughout my treatment ) but again this is personal and based on research, and I have no sugar, white starchy carbs and I now focus fat and protein in my diet but I find this easy as I follow a Pescetarian diet and still have dairy/eggs - so full fasting would have been just another step...     Fasting does not have to be cutting out food completely - it can be intermittent, reducing calories like the 5/2 program -  I recommend you speak to your oncologist and ask to be referred to a dietitian if interested.... like anything there is a lot of information out there so it is overwhelming. I have no idea if my decision will help my future - but I feel great and healthy... and yes I will have a glass of wine or two.... I wish you well on your decision...   Jill xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief  Where is this year going? then again there are moments I want it to go quicker. I shall be joining in April - I am still waiting for my oncotype test (I live in middle east and goes to US) so we are starting with radiotherapy first (and cross fingers no chemo needed)...   I get 'fitted' out this week and all going will start radiotherapy next Sunday.  Have been reading March posts but thought I would say hello to April. Lumpectomy 4 March - Grade 2 ER+ PE+ HER2- (lymph nodes clear)...   But this is NOT who I am... I am a lover of yoga who runs for fun... I sail the seas and ski mountains and am currently working in Qatar as is my fabulous husband - no snow here but lots of other activities, including sailing - until we hit 45+ degrees then we shade hop....  Following surgery - I went back to work and am back on the yoga mat and have had success jogging in the last week - definitely a jog... I have everything crossed I can continue - at least yoga which makes me smile. Like everyone - the unknown is scary and waiting is hard and at times patience and I are NOT friends. I support Macmillan so found my way here and everyone is helping me through my journey - even if it is by just reading other journeys.  Wishing you all a a lovely Easter Sunday and look forward (in a strange way) to our April journey.... and kicking the sh*t out of cancer.... swear words and I are BEST friends on this journey....   sending mindfulness and love.. with a touch of pi**edoff thrown in. xx        ",

I have stopped reading posts and will just see how I get on with it first.. Start following treatment. Hey Jan... Are you still doing long hours? I'm sorry your work is not as understanding..   Even working -They should be allowing you adjusted working hours as and when required.. Going to and from hospital every day is tiring and adding work on is a double banger..  So take care of yourself when you start tomorrow..  Im on day 4 and got tired by end of working day 3..   be thinking of you Tuesday... Everyone I hope the start of your zapping week goes well.. Sending love and positive vibes..  Recipe of the week. www.foodmatters.com/.../hazelnut-truffles Made these on weekend to get me through radiotherapy.. I don't have sugar so didn't need maple syrup with 85% dark chocolate (can also get sugar free).. I use crunchy hazelnut butter .. Seriously yummy full of good fats and for those trying less/zero sugar - a great treat...  Ferrero Rocher home style. With love.Jill xx",

      "Content": "Hi Ange Sortitoutkids I took the 'young' comment and ran it - ha ha... I was 48 when found the lump but heading into 50 at the end of this year...  Did you have chemo? I have done a lot of research into food fasting 24 or 48 hours before chemo and the day of treatment.  Doctors here are all up for fasting benefits which is great... so am going to start preparing now  - up until this year I was following 5/2 days 500 calorie way of eating) so going to start again today... Still undecided on chemo but definitely listening to experts so need another conversation with them... I would be joining the June chemo group... How are you finding tamoxifen?  do you take at night?  We are on the same zaps days -  day 5 this morning (15/5 more to go)... little tired at end of day but I also figure that is because I start day at 6am and hit the couch at 8pm I completely agree with your comments - it seems we have taken a similar approach to cancer - I am head down getting on with it and administrating the hell out of cancer..  but I for one am taking a very long holiday at the end of  treatment hopefully in October..   My year has been horrid as my dad died suddenly from blood clot to heart on 9th January (very fit healthy man and he died on his actual birthday aged 76 - big shock) and having cancer has made it clear to me that I can spend my life doing other things... So my Husband and I are leaving Middle East Quarter 1 2020 and taking a year to travel back to London... Destination unknown at this stage...  I am going to do some living... ha ha I could definitely read your post this morning Alison PennyL.  I am so pleased you enjoyed yoga... I have been practicing for years and go on beautiful mindful yoga retreats every year.. be patient and give yourself lots of love in yoga as it is a life long journey of learning... I love that it is about me and my time on the mat... lately, I have days that the tears flow in Shavasana but  I walk out with a smile on my face... enjoy your journey... yell if you want to know anything.

JoDec hopefully the Germolene cream works - how frustrating to get through treatment to have discomfort now. It is good to know that we should keep a stock of drugs for post zapping... Question - what are you laddies doing for deodorant? I was told not to wear and I can only imagine how much I am gong to smell in the middle east - eek....  Jayg how did you go yesterday for planning meeting?  I have a meeting at 2.30 today before my 4pm first zap - so I have my fingers crossed they have my oncotype test and that the results are low and I head into 4pm meeting with a smile on my face....   good thing today is full of meetings to help distract me before I go.... I also have my yog gear in the hope I can spend some time on the mat.

      "Content": "morning lovely friends - happy Sunday to you all. I hope you are having a relaxing lovely weekend. Work day here in Qatar and zap number 3 for me.  20 and 5 boosters for me.  Hi Jan Jayg I am so pleased you have your first day scheduled on Tuesday.  No matter what we say you will be apprehensive - I certainly was and did not sleep well the night before... but like Ange says... close your eyes, breath and think of a lovely beach sipping cocktails... and no matter what you are on the  countdown clock versus waiting....  Overall I was very underwhelmed during treatment given my imagination.   I know we are all on a different journey - but I am still working full time following day 3 of 7am zaps and going to yoga.. long may it continue... but work are all for me just walking out the door if I need to go home or not come in... I am very lucky.   Similar to Sam, I am only using aloe vera gel - in the fridge so lovely and cold when you put it on. Qatar does not have the R1/R2 cream so I cant comment on this.... My armpit and lymph node scare feel a bit numb (this could be my imagination) - I am also only wearing camisoles versus a bra which is bliss.. Wow Bonnyjules - does your bed move? my bed stays still and the machine moves around me.... no wonder you have motion sickness.  jacks77  I was told by my radiotherapist that you may also feel nauseous as part of the side effects as the treatment does hit the top of your liver and I know from reading other comments woman do feel nauseous. They all suggested ginger tea and ginger biscuits.  PennyL I love yoga and practice daily - I found that being on the mat has helped me... and it sounds like you are on the right path for you... I have no idea how I will feel at the end of treatment - as you say we are so consumed with results, waiting and treatment we dont actually take time out to see how we feel.  I wish you well on giving yourself some healing and self-loving... I got my oncotype results back today (score 21... I am 49)  Will do some serious research as chemotherapy is my decision to make - swinging  towards no chemo... Oncologist has given me until post radiotherapy to make my decision as he says I am in treatment which is the important thing - it is difficult for friends and family to understand  how hard this decision is... I do not wish to look back to this point and think I wish I did... I need to live with this decision... and move forward with determination and no doubt.  So today I am feeling pissed-off with cancer... my brain has had enough   Oh and I am not using deodorant and funny enough I don't smell at all... not sure if it is due to radiotherapy...   Jill",

I certainly hope you can have that cruise in the summer - escape and enjoy.  Hi Ange Sortitoutkids  I love Singapore - nice and close to me in Qatar... My 50th is in October.  Woohoo on the Tamoxifen... just cuddle your husband when you have sweaty hot flush... share the experience... I have read a few posts on here where woman have come off hormone drugs due to side effects - and some have made the decision not to start based on research.  It would be a very difficult decision to make and I feel for them.  I'm going to cross my fingers and get on with it....  and hope for the best...  I have always been healthy but after much research have gone super charged and will continue to see if it also helps with Tamoxifen - basically Pescetarian Diet - but also no sugar (including high sugar fruit), white carbs (white flour, rice, pasta) or alcohol.. Has been easy shift  as mentally like you, it has been about preventing another incident and more research is being done on our diets - which I am advocate for.. I eat loads of yummy stuff and turn up to restaurants - so not changed how I live....just a bit more picky... though I am going to go back to red wine following treatment - good for your heart ha ha...  But I feel healthy and great.   I had the same thought process as you 25 and under = NO  which is why I am still talking to my oncologist... He has even gone as far as speaking to a European research expert and it was her recommendation...which he is in support of... maybe that is good enough - but will still ask my questions.  Like you said it needs to be a decision we can live with.  I will let you know know where I land.

I am so excited that today is your last radiotherapy session Sam - I know you still have a journey ahead of you, but this is such a significant milestone and you should feel however you bloody well want to feel... then eat cake  Sending you lots of love today... and hope the itching stops... Hi Katiepie  Some us will be going through radiotherapy into May so feel free to ask any question - this is your journey and one thing I have learnt; is we all have different experiences, but sharing helps.  I am only using Aloe Vera Gel twice a day (lovely and cold in the fridge) and baby wash (no chemicals) and I take baby wipes to work as I keep thinking I smell as I dont wear deodorant.  I have just had zap 6 and today my boob looks like it has been sun kissed.  I am still working and going to yoga (my first love beyond my husband) - but this is my journey and it is currently working for me.  How did you get on Jan? Jayg   Big kiss to you all... since I am at work I better get on with it... Jill",

Zap 8 today and BOY was it nice having a rest from the hospital over the weekend - especially as had a lovely spa day with the girls.  Aloe Vera gel seems to be still doing the trick for me - long may it continue... Was starting to get a bit itchy over weekend, but I slapped some Aloe on and it seems to ease the need... Jan Jayg How has the swelling gone over the weekend?  We should take time off work as needed to focus on our health, both mentally and physically. Cancer is one tough and tiring gig and whilst I am doing well and continue to rock up to work, I am taking a mental health day at the end of this week for a long weekend...I need a breather.  We come first. Gablegirl.  How are the raised spots going? cross fingers you get a date for your seroma this week... waiting is a constant and real pain in the bum with cancer...  Hi karebear and Nutmeg56 I have not started Tamoxifen as chemo has come back on the agenda.  I can say that Aloe Vera in the fridge is fabulous and is all that I am using.  I also use baby wash and baby wipes (no chemicals and dont use deodorant). I do shave though (cant remember who mentioned this).  I hope you are both doing well and recovering following chemo - I have been recommended (I am undecided) 4 cycles of TC which would start in June.... hmmm Enjoy your Sunday laddies... I hope you all have lovely plans and are doing well..  Hugs from the Middle East. Jill  xx   ",

On 5 March I had lumpectomy and 5 lymph nodes removed and yesterday was upgraded to Stage 2 (lymph nodes and margin all clear \u2013 yay) PR+ ER+ HER2+ (Fish negative - yay) but still waiting on Oncotype Dx genomic test to ascertain if I need chemo given history.    It has been a sad and crap start to the year.   Cancer is definitely technical so have been reading all your wonderful posts and doing my own research. It does take some time to get your head around \u2013 and I wake up some days and think \u2018what the hell\u2019.  Actually most days.   Im an Aussie, but London is home (12 years) though currently working in Qatar Doha (Middle East) an work is amazing, hospital/care/treatment have been fabulous (and fast) but there is no online community and I support MacMillan foundation so  this is the community I would like to call home for a while.  My Husband is beautiful and my friends and family are beside me across the world \u2013 but already I can feel the benefit of joining a community that understands what my journey is really like.   I have learnt that patience and I need to become friends \u2013 so far we are not on speaking terms.    I went back to work following surgery and  got out into the fresh air for walks (currently not 45+ - though summer is coming) \u2013  admittedly I was shocked by how tired I was and that my underarm and armpit felt like they were caught in a vice \u2013 and I did rest when I needed (Netflix became my friend) but for me being active and working (when I can) is the approach I am taking \u2013 and so far so good\u2026.   Yesterday I was signed off to go back to my first love \u2013 Yoga\u2026 and boy did this make me cry with happiness when I rolled out my mat in class and did a wonderful mindful class \u2013 stayed away from handstands as thought that may not be in the \u2018moderate exercise\u2019 list \u2013 my husband made me sit down and discuss \u2018moderate\u2019 with him before I left the house ha ha\u2026.   Anyway I am sure I will have lots of questions and will join others threads once I have treatment plan but wanted to say hi to an amazing group of people.  ",

I definitely had a 'f**k you to cancer party' with my husband and friends across the world... it became our chant - and still is....  We cant WAIT for the day we have the 'no more f**king cancer party'.  We all agree that swearing is very appropriate with cancer.... Explode away...  then do it twice for good measure and we will listen.  This is a very stressful time and it looks like we will be taking this journey together...   My dad (very fit man) sadly passed away suddenly from blood clot to heart in January (on his birthday which is just crazy) so I did not tell anyone (except my beautiful husband) as I went back to Australia to say my heartfelt farewells and be with my mum - it was the hardest secret I have ever kept.   I researched the hell out of breast cancer (my coping mechanism) and read the wise words from the brave woman on this community then started to write a daily diary of research, questions, feelings (both physical and mental) diet and exercise... it has helped me.... especially as the lives of others continued as they did the day before. My lumpectomy and lymph node surgery was 4 March 2018 Grade 2 PR+ ER+ HER2- still waiting on oncotype test for chemo but starting radiotherapy next two weeks as I live in Middle East so could take up to a month for oncotype results and my lovely oncologist wants me to get on with treatment in the hope chemo will not be required.   I call him lovely as he keeps calling me young (49).  I felt the same as you at the start of my journey but have found my voice and am now very open about cancer to my family friends and colleagues...   This is NOT the year I want - but it is the year I am having so I am having my moments.. This is your time to stand up and say this is about me - I know life continues around us but we are an important part of life   ... You take your journey and do what you need as we are all different... I love that we all stand up and say this is me and this is how I feel on this site. I found out pretty quickly who I love but are not that great at support and who are just fabulous - but overall you will find you are loved and as much as people may not always say the right thing, I do find they are coming from a good place.  This is certainly the case from me and lets be honest we all have our moments of saying the wrong thing in life. I have no other wise words (not sure they are even wise) as I am just starting out on this crap journey - but I  am at work and back on my yoga mat (which make me smile) and every day is a new day which I take as it comes... which includes telling my cancer to go f**k off and having a laugh with those that I love. I hope my bleeping does not offend anyone - I am a nice girl deep down... just not on cancer days. Jill xx ",

I worked full time and did yoga throughout my treatment - but when I finished radiotherapy (20/5 boosters) was when I felt fatigue -  I do believe some of this is pushing myself (stupidly at times) everyday for months on end and finally starting tamoxifen (we are not great friends - though getting better... I'm on day 50). I am still working full time and practicing yoga - and have just finished a wreck open water diving course - woohoo (was planned for January but then I was diagnosed) - but there are days I say just stop as a big brick wall has got in the way... usually around 3-4pm. I cant sleep away the fatigue as I cant seem to nap on weekends or sleep in and tamoxifen wakes me with hot flushes during the night - so I just sit and read or watch TV... I find even if I leave work an hour or two earlier than normal this helps when I am tired.   I get annoyed some days as I want the old full of energy person back - but Im trying to roll with it and deal with the new me knowing that my energy levels will return if im patient... as my husband has said - you have had cancer be kind and respect your body. I do believe being active helps - so I do something even if it is just 30 minutes as it often makes me feel better and less tired... but then just relax... especially on the weekends.  Good luck - Jill x  ",

When I started I had a horrible time for the first 40 days whereas throughout my treatment I was fine (worked, exercise etc)   - so to suddenly feel nausea and tense every day if I took in the morning and not able to fall asleep and hot flushes if I took at night was too much - I didnt like the new zombie me and it ended in tears as was very emotional... I did my research and spoke to my oncologist and I now split my tablet and take half in the morning and half at night - and so far so good.  I no longer have any nausea or feel tense or emotional (within days)... I still have hot flushes and my sleep is disturbed because of the flushes but I can now fall asleep and go back to sleep, even with splitting the tablet hot flushes only come at night.. But I feel like me again - slightly tired version of me - though I think this is also about recovering from cancer...  Not providing 10 mg tablets is a pharmaceutical cost issue not a medical reason and lots of woman have fared better on splitting the 20 mg... for me I wanted to do everything I could in the hope that cancer does not return -  but I do know I would not have lived 10 years based on my first 30 days - so I spoke up and did my research.  and some woman have no issues with tamoxifen... so I say worth trying... try different times of day (morning then night) and if that doesnt work try splitting the tablet - speak up to your oncologist...

At this stage preserving (but not silently so oncologist work and home know what is going on).   If I take at night - I dont sleep and get hot flushes. If I take in the morning I have nausea, diarrhea and a headache and get punched in the face with fatigue and loose concentration - all day...  Im still working and going to yoga in the hope that my body is on a journey and I do find it better (especially emotionally) if I keep moving then sit still.    After doing a lot of research, My oncologist has agreed to let me split my tamoxifen tablet and try 10mg in morning and 10mg at night to see if I fare better (some woman have as not getting hit all at once and symptoms significantly reduced - or went away).  I started yesterday and I figure it may take a few days / weeks. There was research on reducing to 10 mg only but has not really progressed given so many priorities in cancer research.   It is another option as it is important we can live versus the side-effects taking away who we are - So dont stay silent. If I'm still rubbish we will try something different as my oncologist can see I am not myself. All the best - it sucks. Jill xx  ",
