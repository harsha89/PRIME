    "Content": "HI, I have also been taking Tamoxifen, since November 2015. I was doing fine until recently when I have been having lots of different side effects. Hot flushes, cold sweats, palpitations, low mood. I visited my doctor today and he has given me medication to try out. Hope this helps xx",
