    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. I had partial lumpectomy, licap reconstruction, chemo and radiotherapy. In the past couple of years I\u2019ve started experiencing excruciating sharp pains in my toes and the side of my knee. I\u2019m guessing this is an after effect of the chemo. Does anyone else have any experience of this and any tips on how to manage it? I just want something to help with the pain when it\u2019s happening, I don\u2019t want to take medication all the time. Any info anyone has would be much appreciated. Thxs.",
