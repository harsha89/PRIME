      "Content": "Ah, Siani, another person whose cancer was spotted by a pet!  Me too.  It's an amazing and humbling thing to owe your life to an animal in that way, isn't it?   To start off with, you have a right to feel whatever feelings you feel.  They are yours.  However you react to having cancer, plus all the other medical stuff you have going on for you - that's the right way to react.  There's no wrong way to be with this.  I think you need to be authentic - you need to deal with the cancer in the way that is best for you. With friends like yours, to be honest, who needs enemies?  I often think that remarks like that (\"wallowing\" in cancer?  What, do they think it's like a hot bath or something??!) reflect fear on the part of the people who say them.  People think that if they can make you behave as if nothing's wrong, then you won't put any demands on them or make them feel bad about how little they may be doing for you.  There's also what I think of as the myth of positivity, too.  If I'd had a quid for every time I had the advice 'stay positive, it's the best thing to do to fight cancer', I'd be a rich woman.  Still p**sed off, mind, but rich. Perhaps you can train your kitten to fly at people who say such stupid things?  :-)",

One day, maybe.  It's nice to know that the options are there, should I want them.",

I'd be really glad to hear personal experiences from people here, if you care to share.  Thanks folks!",

Good to see some of my old friends here, and to see some new names too.  We're all survivors, each and every one of us.  There's a lot of life to still be lived, even with a scary diagnosis, and I intend to live it fully.  May we all do the same!",

(He was very suspicious of my wig, too.)  I am sure that your dogs will soon settle - and it is good for them (and for you) to let them comfort you.  Dogs are great at that.   I'm sorry that you aren't having a good day, too.  I'm sending you hugs.",

I think it would also be worthwhile knowing exactly what you DO want them to do for you.  What would perfect behaviour from your sister-in-law look like?  She may have no idea what to do, and you may have to ask very specifically for what you want.  Yes yes, I know this is hard, you've never done it before, and it is outrageously unfair that you have to do it, but she's obviously not getting it.  What do you want your sister to do?  Your family?  If they are still expecting you to cook and clean for them whilst you are going through treatment, they need to know that that's not going to happen.  Remember that emotional blackmail is your friend throughout all of this.  (Yes, I am prepared to do whatever it takes, I am afraid - I have secondary cancer and potentially a short time to live, and I actually don't give a shit any more.) Ooops - I have to go to the hospital myself for an appointment (now where is my special Hospital Waiting Room Knitting??)  Remember, Trudi, we have your back, we are here, and we understand.  Come back, rant often, rant at length.  We will always listen.",

      "Content": "Wow, Kimberley.  I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles.  I get the most terrible sense of your desperation from your post, and my heart goes out to you.  I am not sure what advice I can give, because this is a tangle which has been many years in the making.  I also don't have children, so I can only have an intellectual understanding of your relationship with your daughter, not a gut feeling about it.   My first thought is that you need to look after yourself and your husband.  Physically speaking, Tamoxifen side effects can be very wearing, and I wonder whether there's anything that can be done to help deal with those.  A trip to your doctor might well help there. Your husband may well not be able to come up with solutions to this tangle, but I think you should keep talking to him about it.  It is hurt which is affecting both of you, and by sharing it, you keep the lines of communication open.  Make sure that there is no blame in your discussions though - it's not your fault and it's not his fault, it's something that has happened, and you can't turn back the clock.  (I'm from a farming background, and the agricultural attitude of 'shit happens - now let's deal with it' has stood me in good stead in my life!) I think it would be a great idea for you to find a counsellor, someone who is well outside your family dynamic who can be an independent ear for you to talk to.  You are right in the middle of a horrible mess, and I know from experience that it is incredibly valuable to talk to someone who can help you get some perspective on matters.   The business about your daughter leaving her partner and returning to him again rings some alarm bells.  I think it would be worthwhile reading a book called The Gift of Fear, by Gavin De Becker.  There's a lot in there which is completely irrelevant (although the theory De Becker suggests, of trusting your instincts, is relevant in almost any area of our lives!) but there's some interesting stuff about people who return to difficult relationships.  It might give an insight into what's happening, it might not. I'm so sorry that you have all this on your plate.  Your cancer treatment was really not all that long ago - I know I don't feel fully recovered yet, and it's over 2 years since I finished my treatment - and it is a cruel fate which has given you all this to deal with too.  You're in my thoughts.

      "Content": "Oh Jude, I wish I could crawl down the broadband line and give you a hug.  Your fear and worry absolutely leaps out of your posts - and of course it does, this is an extremely scary time.  We hear you.  Life is so bloody unfair sometimes.  When I had breast cancer a few years ago, one of the nurses told me that it doesn't just happen to the patient - it happens to everyone in that patient's web of family and friends.  My husband reckons that, in a way, it's easier to be the one who's having the treatment than the one who has to stand by and see their beloved relative going through it all.  He felt incredibly helpless. I need to tell you something about having brothers and sisters.  I have two sisters.  I love them both, but we are not at all close, and neither of them were a support to me when I was ill.  I would just like to let you know that brothers and sisters aren't all they are cracked up to be, sometimes!  I hope that will make you feel that being an only child is not such a disaster.   It is perfectly OK to feel however you feel about your mum's illness.  I don't think there is a right way or a wrong way to feel at this point.  Your feelings might change very quickly, too - one moment you might be feeling despairing, the next you might feel much more positive.  I think you just have to let that happen.  If you feel you have to push people away, then do so.  If you want to talk to people, then we are always here.  You may find (as I did) that friends come to you whilst you are going through all this, people who you don't know now, or perhaps you hardly know them.  It is hard to just not care about what people think of you (I still have trouble with this, and I am 43!) and I don't have any top tips on how to do this.  When you are younger, you'll find that many of your friends have no life experience, and they really haven't got a clue about how to get through a difficult time.  This may make them say cruel and thoughtless things.  (Mind you, plenty of older people are the same!) If it is any comfort, I can tell you from my experience that the early days of the cancer 'journey' are the hardest.  Once your mum gets into the treatments, things are somehow easier to get your head around.  You know where you are going, you know how you have to get there, and that's a definite comfort.  Some of the treatments are physically a challenge, but you kind of get used to the idea of them and then it's just a question of slogging through it. I think that you need to find someone who you can talk to, to tell them how you feel, rant if you need to, let off steam so that you can support your mum.  I have had a good experience phoning the Macmillan helpline (the phone number's plastered all over this website) and I wonder whether they might be able to help you?  They don't know you, and sometimes I think that's helpful because they can see your situation clearly.  And of course they are used to talking to people about this sort of issue all the time, whereas a lot of people we know in our lives just aren't. ajhdfjdsh  Oops, my ginger kitten has just arrived on my keyboard and randomly hit some keys.  I'll leave what he wrote here, just in case he's trying to send you his love too.  I'll keep you and your mum in my thoughts.  Keep in touch.  You and your mum will come out of this OK, but you will be changed by it, as we all are.  I look on my bout of cancer as a real turning point in my life - and good has come of it, believe it or not.

Glad to hear, too, that the breast care nurse was helpful!  You soon get to know how to navigate the system, and the BCNs are the best guides to it. All the very best",

      "Content": "Hello there H! Cool!  The lumps are benign.  You are definitely much further forward than you were 24 hours ago.  This is an excellent thing to know.   They have given you the number of a breast care nurse precisely because you do not know the system!  That's her (in my experience, usually it's a woman) job, to help you navigate it.  If you need to speak to the doctor, the BCN will help you with that.  They are usually available during office hours, so you can phone on Monday morning and get some advice.  My BCN was very interested in everything to do with my treatment, and also in getting to know me as a person.  She was the most amazingly helpful guide to the whole thing.  It's a shame you didn't manage to meet yours today.   I had wondered how much information you would actually be getting today.  It was my experience that one lot of tests would lead to another, but it would take a while before I got the whole picture.  You may also find that, even though the lumps are benign, they may want to do something about them anyway (\"we don't like lumps\" said my surgeon) - in my case, they wanted to make sure there was nothing lurking behind them (there was).  But I had a real live, bona fide cancerous lump as well, so they knew that all was not OK.  Things might be different for you. It is very hard to cultivate a sort of attitude where you are in suspended animation, almost - waiting without any attachment to the result.  I don't think that gets much easier with practice. Take care, keep in touch",

I think that it is hard to make any concrete plans about what to do during chemo, because everyone reacts differently.  I had some great ideas about what I was going to eat, only to find that I couldn't keep it down, or it upset my tummy, or it tasted horrid because I had a constant metallic taste in my mouth.  I also found that I got obsessive cravings for some things - avocados, of all things, with oil and vinegar dressing.  I couldn't have predicted that one! When I was ill, I found that what I really wanted from the people around me was truth.  It is good to be strong for the person who is ill, but during the times when my husband was finding things difficult, I wanted to know.  It made our relationship that much stronger.  I think that if you don't show your emotions, it can come across as being uncaring, even if you are doing it for the best possible reasons.  But you will know what will best help your sister. I would like to reassure you that chemo is very doable, and although it is unpleasant (sometimes very unpleasant!) there are many unexpected moments of lightness and hope along the way.  I learned a lot about myself, and about my friends and family.  Breast cancer is so treatable these days, and I am sure that your sister will come out the other side. Keep us posted - and if your sister wants to come and talk to us as well, it would be great to 'see' her here! All the best",

If I might say so, I think that it is hardly surprising that you are finding it hard to be positive.  You have had a terrible medical adventure which affects you to this day, and you have lost a close member of your family recently.  It would be a miracle if you could come up smiling after that double whammy.  Things will get better - as I often find myself saying, this too shall pass.  Nothing that you feel in this situation is wrong - you have a right to feel your feelings, and I believe that being relentlessly positive is too much of a burden.   I'm sending you a load of hugs.  I'm sure that Kate's right about ringing the MacMillan helpline - it would be good to get an expert perspective on this.  You will be OK.

Your comment about going shopping and everyone else being 'normal' reminds me of something my husband said, after all my treatment was over and I was getting better.  He said that when he travels on the Tube, or is in a crowd of people, he looks at the women near him and wonders whether they are breast cancer patients or survivors too.  After all, 1 in 8 of us will have a brush with it during our lives, so statistically there are bound to be people on that train, or on that escalator, who have gone through what we are going through now.  They look 'normal' too... He said it was a comfort to him, to think that there are thousands of women who have gone through all the treatment and are now getting on with their lives.  I think it's an interesting thing to remember - you never know what is going on for other people.  After all, I bet nobody else out shopping with you that afternoon could possibly have known what was happening for you. I'm thinking of you and wishing you all the best for your treatment.  The chances are that you will come through and be fine.  We're here for you. Much love",

But for those of you who are just starting out on the journey, know that I am very unusual!  The likelihood is that you will never be bothered by your cancer again, and all will be well for you.  And even if you fall into the small group who get a revisit of the cancer, it's all treatable.  I'm just waiting for that process to start.

It is a remarkable thing that you have done - that all of us have done - to get through the ordeal of treatment and to come out the other side.  You are brave and powerful and you WILL get through this, whatever happens. (My mammogram worked out fine - all clear, thankfully.  And I'm sure yours will too.  The stats are on your side in this, after all.  But I know that may not be much comfort right now.)",

Seriously, though, I think this is a rather personal thing, and is probably to do with the impact that the treatment/disease has on your life.  There's that very intense time when you can't do anything else other than get through the treatment; then things start to tail off, appointment letters from the hospital arrive less frequently, you don't have to take a shed-load of drugs every day...

Your boyfriend has let you know who he really is by cheating on you.  He's basically told you he's a shit - always useful to know.  I don't know whether you believe in karma or not, but I do, and I think he's set himself up for a monumental karmic smack-down.  Maybe not today or tomorrow, but someday down the line, he'll get his.   When I had my mastectomy, it was described to me as a straightforward physical operation with extremely complex psychological aspects to it.  Some women sail through, and some don't.  I definitely think that you should talk to your breast care nurse - I don't think I had realised when I was going through all the treatment, but they do have such a role in keeping our thoughts on an even keel.  I take it that you have a plan to undergo reconstruction surgery?  I know that it's not the same, but I have spoken to women who feel massively relieved when their reconstructions are done.   Cancer is an incredibly life-changing event, and not necessarily in a good way - it is as if some powerful force takes your life and shakes it violently.  I'm two and a half years from the finish of my treatment, and I still feel the shaking every now and then.  But my life is settling, and I hope yours will too.   Keep talking to us - we understand.

I totally believe that we get the best treatment available from the NHS - and the soaring survival rates testify to this.  I also believe that if you think that route's not for you, then you should be able to go down a different one.  At the end of the day, it is our choices and our bodies.  It's also, I believe, a valid choice to say no to treatment altogether (knowing that I could actually say no to any or all of the treatments made it easier, in a strange way, to agree to have them - I hate being forced into things).  But it is an individual path that we follow, and it is not for us to question what others have chosen.   Chloecat, I wish you well.  I wish you didn't have to go through all of this, of course - I wish that for all of us here - and I know you'll make the right decision for you.

Whiskers, here you are heard, and here you can rail to your heart's content.  I wish I had some comforting words for you, about how things will get better, about how your team are working hard on your behalf, about how you will look back on this and realise how strong and capable and amazing you are, to have got through it all.  (And all of those things are true.)  But at the moment, you are fed up and tired and in pain, and it's OK to feel angry and crappy about it.  I am sorry that this is happening to you. Can you talk to your breast care nurse?  It is their job to be the bridge between all the treatments you are undergoing.  Perhaps if they know that you are feeling this way, they can smooth things over a bit for you?",

I have to say that a few things have happened over the last few months which made me wonder whether it would come back.  I am quite a superstitious person (I had my life saved by a sheep, so of course I am superstitious!) and I think that with the loss of said sheep, back in July, I felt as if my early warning system had been taken from me.  We've been going through a terrific amount of personal upheaval which has been very unwelcome, too.  But the return of the cancer has cut through a lot of that crap and will hopefully make some decisions easier.   And now I am both exhausted and starving hungry.  In the midst of life we are in death - and in need of a snack.

      "Content": "Hey friends, it's me again.  I have realised that I haven't updated you for a while, so here I am with the latest news.  I have had a CT and a bone scan, which has revealed that I have mets in both the right and left sides of my pelvis (the right is very much worse and the bone's fairly honeycombed), tiny patches on three ribs, and one little bit on my right clavicle.  The scans were fairly traumatic because it is very difficult to find my veins for the cannula and I was pretty scared about that, but the resident expert in the scanning department (a huge shout-out to Patrick, who my friend has dubbed the phlebotomancer because he also managed to take blood from me, a fairly difficult task at the best of times!) managed without any problem.  We then got a call from the hospital again the following day, calling me back in for another CT scan urgently because they spotted some blood clots on my lungs which they wanted to have a closer look at.  After that, I saw one of the oncology doctors, who gave me the good news that the cancer is just in the bones at the moment.  They have also prescribed me daily Fragmin injections for the clots, which will hopefully sort them out.   I went back to see my consultant about 10 days later, and although it was under horrible circumstances, it was lovely to see her again.  I also briefly saw my surgeon in the waiting room, who squeezed my hand and whispered that they have lots of patients in my position who do really well for many years - it was great to hear that from him.  My consultant has prescribed Anastrazole and Zolodex for me, plus the bone strengthening drug whose name never sticks in my mind (begins with D?) and I will be having radiotherapy pretty soon to deal with the pain and get me walking again.  At the moment I am not allowed to do any weight bearing exercise, but they reckon that will change once the treatments kick in.   The consultant asked me what we have done about the sheep, and I said that we have some friends helping us with them at the moment.  She said that she was glad we hadn't done anything rash like selling them, because she was aiming to get me able to look after them again, albeit without any of the heavy lifting.  The breast care nurse said later that the whole team is very motivated to make sure that I have as long with the sheep as I can possibly have, because they know how important they are to me.  But we have lined up a home for them, just in case, and I am sure they will be going there eventually.  It's a lovely place, with a good friend of mine, and I think they'll be happy there.  My horse is being looked after by a lovely lady who I am hoping will take him over completely after a while - I doubt I will ride again now.  My husband is currently keeping his Shetland pony, who I think is proving to be a very helpful support for him.  Husband goes to the farm and spends time just brushing the pony's mane and tail, which is very soothing for both of them! I am very up and down about all of this.  Before I saw the consultant I asked my husband to take away my stock of painkillers and put them somewhere I couldn't get at them - I was worried that the bit of me which can unflinchingly pluck turkeys and wring the necks of chickens might get the upper hand and I would do something that my friends and family would certainly regret.  I think that worried everyone a bit more than it would have done if I were weepy and emotional.  But that urge has now receded since I spoke with the consultant.  I feel I have a future tense, as my friend put it, albeit one the length of which we do not know.  (But then again, none of us know!)  I have got a few projects which I would like to finish, the most important being writing a book about my life with Alfie the famous sheep, so I can't check out just yet.   Good things have come of all this.  Our move to the East Midlands (which I really was unhappy about) has been shelved for the time being.  I have seen a lot more of my friends and family.  One friend in particular, who I was always fond of, has been a complete trooper, visiting me every day and keeping my spirits up.  Even the people who I thought might not feel able to step up have done so.  Some of my friends have formed a Team Sheep rota, where they each go to the farm one day a week and check the flock, and I'm surprised at how much pleasure that is giving them.  Because it's just my life, I forget how unusual a thing it is for a non-agricultural person to get out in the open air and interact with that group of charmers which is my flock.  My life has streamlined, and I have a direction again, which is to just do the treatments for this latest setback and to deal with being ill, which I realise now that I am actually very good at.   The ghost of Alfie the sheep is always there with me, especially in the hospital where, it turns out, I am the most famous (or notorious?) patient in the breast centre.  They did all know that he had died, and every single person who knew me from the first time round has quietly said how sad they were when they heard.  I had a piece of his fleece clutched in my hand whilst going through all the scanners, and even though he's not around any more, he's still doing the job of making sure that everyone remembers me - it's a very useful thing!   So I think that's it.  I am still just in a holding pattern, waiting for the radiotherapy to start - I'm seeing the consultant for that on 1st May - and then we will find out where we go from there.  I might not be on here all that often, but I will pop back every now and then and keep you posted. Much love to all of you, my friends, and may the Power of the Miracle Sheep (as some of the papers put it) be with you!",

There's usually a bit of waiting around for tests, results etc. in the early stages of this sort of thing.  It can be wearing on the nerves, and we all have our ways of getting our heads around it.  There's no right or wrong way to do it!

I think that the reason I empathise with your situation is that I remember when I was at the same stage of the \"journey\".  By the time I knew for certain what I was dealing with, I had put in a lot of worrying time.  Those couple of weeks would have been just as horrible if, at the end, they'd said to me 'Oh well, it's nothing, off you go, and don't listen to sheep when they tell you you've got cancer, because they're often wrong' (see my profile for the low-down on that one!)  It is weird, but for so many of us, the early days are the absolute worst.  Actually, when I did know what I was dealing with, I worried less. You will undoubtedly feel as if you're on a rollercoaster, and as you have observed, that's OK.  We understand!  We've been on it, and survived to tell the tale.  So will you! All the best",

How comfortable you are with your medical team will definitely help or hinder you in getting information.  My surgeon was brilliant, my oncologists were fantastic, and I trusted them all implicitly.  They never let me believe something that turned out not to be true, and they were always right about what they thought would happen.  That meant that I threw myself entirely on their knowledge, and let them do their job. It was the right thing to do for me. I'm sure some of the others will weigh in with their own thoughts.  I really hope that you get good news when you go for your appointment - and if you do, I and the sheep will dance around the field in your honour! All the best",

      "Content": "Hey Orangetulip I'm sorry that things are so overwhelming for you right now.  The one thing that helped me most when I went through my treatment 2 and a bit years ago was the realisation that I had a choice.  You could actually go to your oncologist and say \"you know what?  I don't want to have any chemo, thanks.\"  You could refuse any or all of your treatments.  You could walk out of the hospital right now and not go back.  I chose to have all the treatments on offer, but the knowledge that I could have said no somehow helped me.  It was as if, by taking the time to make that decision, I stopped the merry-go-round for a few moments, and then started it again myself.   You know, if you get a wig, all that means is that you've got a wig.  You might not lose your hair - that happened to someone I went through treatment with.  You might get the most knockout wig on the planet which makes you smile every time you put it on (I wanted a pink one, but I never managed to find one).  I didn't enjoy the being bald, but once I had my wig on, not only did it fool everyone else, but it kind of fooled me, too.  I never looked at myself in the mirror without it on, and I was able to apply a healthy sort of denial to the whole thing.  (And when my hair grew back, it was AWESOME.  Pity it went back to what I had before, very dull.) I remember the early time, when you're waiting for the results of tests and you have the spectre of chemo looming on the horizon, as being the most scary time.  Once you set off on the path you choose to take, whatever that is, things will get better.  And we are here for you. PS.  I'm not recommending that you actually refuse treatments, of course!  What I'm saying is that you just recognise that you could.  ",

Just breathe, remind yourself that the majority of lumps in breasts are benign, and go and do your favourite calming activity.  (Mine is knitting.)  All will be well, and all manner of things will be well.  I have confidence that you will be absolutely fine.

      "Content": "Hey folks I'm taking part in the Supremo trial, but I'm in the non-radiotherapy arm of it.  Like many of us, I would not have qualified for radiotherapy in the usual way of things, and my oncologist told me that if she thought it would have definitely benefitted me, then I would have had it.  As it turned out, I'm not having the treatment anyway, having been randomly selected not to undergo it.  If I had had the radiotherapy, I'd have been OK with that, too, having decided that I would throw everything available at the cancer.  It is a very personal decision, I think, whether to participate in something like that; you have to weigh up the pros and cons for you (which might well be different to anyone else's!)",
