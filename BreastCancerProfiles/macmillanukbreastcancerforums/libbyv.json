      "Content": "Hi Judi Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm so glad you've finally finished your treatment and can start to rebuild your life again, even though you may now be taking some form of long term medication. I was diagnosed with grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma and DCSI in November 2013. I had surgery early December and then again early January as margins weren't clear. Unlike you I didn't have chemo as only 0.1 per cent cells were found in sentinel nodes which apparently is classed as negative. Chemo was still discussed with me because of this but oncologist said the benefits would be minimal, only 3% so I decided against it. I saw clinical oncologist on 18th March and am waiting for a call to go for planning assessment for radiotherapy, 20 sessions. The long wait adds to the anxiety. I'm also taking anastrozole and calceos. It is so valuable to read of other ladies experiences and tips on how to minimise the effects of treatment. It's fear of the unknown and reassurance from someone who's already been there really helps. Very best wishes",

      "Content": "Hi Anne I'm sorry you're having so many problems with your medication. I'm taking anastrozole and have been prescribed calcium and vitamin D. Two weeks ago I was also prescribed alendronic acid as my DEXA scan showed my bones are a little thin for my age (I'm 62) and because anastrozole can affect bone density. I did have a few muscle aches in my ankles, especially after resting for a while and then moving about again. However, since taking the alendronic acid tablets I have noticed an improvement. I believe Alendronic acid is given to patients with osteoporosis or to prevent it. I take one tablet once a week. I hope my post has helped a little.",

I had to have second operation beginning of January as the margins weren't clear. There was no lymph node involvement so no chemo and am grateful for that. I am still waiting for radiotherapy to start. I saw the oncologist on 18th March who said I will hear in the next week or 2 for my planning assessment. I'm worried that it has been a long time since my operation and wondered if anyone else has had a long wait for radiotherapy. It's the waiting that seems to be the worse. I'd be really interested to hear what other ladies have experienced. Regards",

I was given hydrogel and Activeheal foam non adhesive pads to place under my breast. The hydrogel didn't really help so GP prescribed flamazine cream which prevents infection. It was really good and helped with the healing process. My breast is still red and sore in places but the flamazine cleared the blisters. I am still washing the area with aqueous cream and using simple baby bath for the rest of my body. Sleeping topless also helps but I find applying aqueous cream about 4 times a day helps with dry patches and the itching. Best wishes to everyone here and hope all goes well for those going through or about to start radiotherapy soon.",
