    "Content": "Can anybody help and tell me if this is quite normal? I had my first chemo 2 weeks ago and touch wood have not been that ill (yet). It is just me and my litle 5 year old at home so I hope this continues. However I started with mouth ulcers 2 days ago and now have a sore throat and my ears hurt when I swallow. To top it all I have bad toothache. My temperature is measuring 38.2. Will I be ok to wait until the morning to ring the doctor?",
