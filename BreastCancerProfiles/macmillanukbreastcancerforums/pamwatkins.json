    "Content": "Hi there, I too am a fellow baldy, or Yoda as my daughter calls me. I found the wig too hot and itchy, so tend to use scarves.  I drape them over my head a bit like hair and then tie them back with a hair band, a bit like putting it in a pony tail. For the warmer weather I am thinking of getting the head scarf with the cooling towel in http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ergodyne-Chill-Its-Evaporative-Cooling-Triangle/dp/B005H5AQC0/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1426701134&sr=8-10&keywords=cooling+hats.. it contains little beads that when wet hold moisture. they seem to have quite good reviews. You can also buy hats that have the same system, I have seen them on Ebay they are made by Trekmates. Good luck and stay cool! xxx",
