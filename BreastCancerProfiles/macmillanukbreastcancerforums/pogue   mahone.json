      "Content": "Thanks Sue and Wendy, thank you for the advice.  I really have had a rough time on the first FEC. I had sickness and was hospitalised, then thrush plus sore throat. I couldn't sleep in hospital as a result of the noise!! So everything has caught up with me. I have just went with what my body needed to do. I.E sleep, rest, eat small portions etc.  Im sure it will be better next time.   Is it ok to take bit b,d and multi vits? I am so grateful for advice from ladies on this site - or else I would have lost the plot!!   Regards Pogue, AKA Caroline   ",

      "Content": "Slante everyone, I recognise your symptoms re feeling low and totally fed up. I asked for antidepressants at night time as I knew the sleeping eating and any other se may effect me. The se's do pull you down - however, please get help. Its so important that we get all the help we can - to just get through the breast cancer journey. Speak to BC nurse tomorrow and they may be able to give you some Amiltriptaline ( I take 10mgs only) to help you. As i have worked in MH services - I knew what dosage and tablets I could take - tolerate.    Take care and please seek advice!!",

I have persisted with the exercises and I agree it is still uncomfortable putting on clothes. I am starting FEC -T next week. I am petrified of this treatment. It will be followed up with herceptin and rads. What im trying to say is you are not on your own re your anxieties.    Regards   Caroline xxx",

      "Content": "Hi al, I also have had faster heart beat during last FEC. I telephoned the cancer ward - who advised me my heart rate was normal. I then spoke to the chemo unit - who advised I may need a blood test or echocardiograme or ecg if this happens. As I had low bloods 3 days before the last chemo - it was seen as a probable cause of my beating heart. This went or slowed down on my second day.    Hope this helps. ",
