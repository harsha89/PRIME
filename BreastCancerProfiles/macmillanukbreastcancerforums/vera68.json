I'm already having hot flushes that keep me awake so I may as well go with that as I'm not too bad during the day and don't want that to change. I was told that I can be prescribed something to help with the hot flushes if they get worse or don't settle down soon.The brand I have been given is Nolvadex-D. Has anyone else used this? How was it for you any tips would be appreciated. Also, the Ladycare menopause magnet was mentioned. What is this? I have never heard of it before.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm really worried as I have found 2 new lumps in my other breast which were immediately biopsied the day after my last treatment.  I'm currently having chemo, just had no 6 of 8 cycles.  I've been told that they think one is a cyst and the other a fibroadenoma, however until we get the results of the biopsies this is such a worry. I don't understand how these lumps have not shown up before or haven't been found by any of the doctors that check me regularly and I've had CT/MRI scans etc, etc, Do the grow that quickly? Would this mean more chemo of they are sinister? It's so distressing that I might need surgery for both breasts and now just as I've nearing the finish line in my chemo treatment cycles. I will also have radiotherapy to follow. Anyone else had any experience of this? Can they remove the worry gene ....please!",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn, Thanks so much for your reply. Yes, I think you're right that it's emotionally difficult when the plan is unclear. I have stage 2, invasive HER+ so I was expecting to have all treatment available. Just finished 4xAC and 4xTaxol/Herceptin. I've now decided that if I need to make the decision on having radiotherapy I will go ahead as I want to make sure I've done everything possible to give me the best outcome. Thanks for your opinion on this. It really helps. I'll be happy when I've heard the outcome of today's meeting so I can get back on track. Best of luck to you!   ",

      "Content": "Hi, Just to follow up. It's all changed for me again....I was re examined and a cyst drained which was on top of my tumour. It's now confirmed that my tumour was smaller than first thought. Great! This is why I was borderline as they were unsure of the size. I'm now not having radio next week as expected but booked in next Tuesday for a quadrantectomy and sentinel node removal. Radiotherapy follows after. I was due to have a mastectomy so this is great news for me. It may still happen as they can't guarantee clear margins but it's worth a try. It's all such a rollercoaster....",

      "Content": "Hi, I finished chemo 3 weeks ago and I've been waiting for a start date for radiotherapy, sometime soon after Easter I was told.  I just found out today that I may not need radiotherapy after all as I'm borderline. My case is up for discussion in Thursdays meeting when all parties can make a decision and I may even be faced with making the decision myself. This could mean that I'm having my surgery just after Easter instead. I had no idea I was borderline until today and haven't even considered how I'd feel about making this decision. Although it would be great not to have RT I'm quite upset that just as I'm prepared for it the goal posts have moved. Also, it means that surgery could be much sooner than I have expected which is a big part of why I'm upset. I haven't yet come to terms with having a mastectomy and haven't discussed my options yet either. Also, surgery would have been the end of June which if after my sons exams. He's already stressed so I don't want to add to that too.  It all feels like it's happening too fast and I'm not in control. Can anyone explain why I may not need radiotherapy and maybe any questions I should ask on Thursday? Is it really advisable to not have RT if there is even a small possibility it could be useful? Any advice would be much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hi, I too am trying to make a decision between DIEP and LD flap. I've already had chemo, and rads and a quadrantectomy, no clear margins so I need a skin sparing Mastectomy. It's so tough isn't it? I'm favouring DIEP too as the results seem to be really good and I'm not too keen on implants. The DIEP surgery and recovery is so much longer but maybe it's worth it in the long run as there seems to be a lower risk of complications and further surgery. I'm very confused as my surgeon had suggested the LD Flap and wanted me to have rads first so that I would not compromise the implants. I've finished rads now and through researching the options available I'd like to explore the DIEP surgery option. I don't even know yet if I have enough fat to donate from my tummy so that may end my dilemma. I'd be interested to hear any further thoughts you have as I've read your bio and we seems quite similar in diagnosis and personal situ. I too have googled nipple tattoos....just in case!",
