      "Content": "chloecat45 Many thanks to everyone who has replied to my piece.  Some have been severely negative but then I expected that (as its hard to understand someone who wants to deviate from the conventional route) and some have helped to stop me to re-consider the conventional route.  However, my head still cannot come to terms with the side effects of the conventional treatment though.  Why would anyone choose to go this path! when the alternatives on this Macmillan site show another way.  What also keeps pushing its way into my head is this route was chosen as it is cost effective to the NHS.  Is this the cheaper of the routes!?! leaving your immune system to deal with the after effects? - if it can! Leaning, at the moment, to Photodynamics - looks 'chuddy-blood'. chloecat45, I felt exactly the same as you, trying to decide between conventional and alternative treatments, and I also felt badgered by other people, medical professionals, family and friends, to go down the conventional route. I too turned down my first operation date as I wanted time to think.  I was diagnosed Feb 2011 and didn't have the op until August of that year, having obtained a 2nd opinion.  My consultant, Mohammed Keshtgar, at The Royal Free in Hampstead, had, the year before, trialled Photodynamic Therapy on 100 women.  He had a 98% success rate!  I was told this wasn't available in the UK as NICE (who always seem slow to sanction new approaches to cancer treatment) had yet to sanction its usage.  In the end I opted for mastectomy, chemo and rads.  I had immediate reconstruction using an implant, but developed capsular contracture due to the rads.  The implant is now very hard and needs to be replaced.  BUT, even before the rads, the implant doesn't feel like a natural breast!  I wish I'd never had the mastectomy; it's destroyed my confidence and, frankly, I've never felt the same since! If you have the chance for photodynamic therapy, and I'm not sure if it's licensed even now, GO FOR IT!  There are a number of breast cancer charities who can advise on alternative approaches, so research these and ask about this therapy.  It negates the need for a mastectomy or lumpectomy. Do let us know how you get on. Stay strong and do what you are happy with.  And yes, you're correct about conventional treatments saving the NHS money.  Get some back up from charities who specialise in alternative approaches. Hugs and best wishes, Beverley. X",

      "Content": "Hi Sacha, Sorry to hear about your mx.  I had a right mx 5 years ago, with immediate reconstruction using an implant which was gradually filled over 3 months.  I had to have rads as well as chemo, but the rads wasn't expected, as cancer was more extensive than assumed.  Unfortunately I developed capsular contracture due to the rads and am now left in chronic discomfort (and sometimes acute discomfort) due to hardening of the tissues surrounding the implants.  I also smoke, despite several attempts at giving up, including hypnosis.  My Plastic surgeon will not replace the implant while I continue to smoke as he argues that healing may be compromised due to less efficient blood flow.  I'm in constant pain and have complained about this. to no avail.  My only option now is to go private (money talks and as long as I give up for two weeks prior and subsequent to the op, I can have this done). It's crucial that your surgeon is sure you won't need rads after the reconstruction.  If you do, it's best to wait a year for the breast tissue to heal before having reconstruction. Hope this helps and good luck!",
