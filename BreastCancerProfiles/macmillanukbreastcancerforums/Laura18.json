    "Content": "Hi I am trying to find fashionable, feminine and most importantly affordable post surgery swimwear.  I have had reconstruction but still need mastectomy swimwear because of the coverage it provides.  I am going on holiday in February and really want to where a bikini. Can anyone suggest places I can look?  And does anyone else think that what's available is expensive? Look forward to hearing from you.  Laura  ",
