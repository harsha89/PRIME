    "Content": "Hi I am about to have my 5th chemo next week. I have coped pretty well all the way through but am now falling down and was wondering if anyone out there has had the same. I ended up being admitted with constipation !! It was not handled the best and had 5 days in hospital which was a bit of a joke. The blockage was sorted but not the problem which I thought was caused by the constipation. I have found since my 3rd chemo that if I eat anything I blow up from below my breast bone and look like I am about 6 months pregnant !! It is also painful and I feel as though I am going to burst. I am worried about this and have started a diary of everything I eat and drink and the reaction I have to take to my Oncologist next week. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. many thanks and good health to everyone Lynda",
