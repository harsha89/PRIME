      "Content": "Hi. I'm new to this website so hope I'm doing this right. 35 diagnosed 22/9/17. 6 weeks after my first baby was born. Stage 3 breast cancer. There 12 months plus. 5/12 nodes positive. Pet scan completed happy bar some marks on my pelvis which the were happy with but need to keep an eye on . Plan 8 sessions of chemo ac/t. After 3rd ac they felt wasn't working. Chemo stopped went to surgery mastectomy of right breast. After surgery finished 4 taxol chemo. Starting radiotherapy next week 5 weeks. The hopefully hormone tablets. During chemo I've been getting aches and pains. Around my ribs. Burning up into my collarbone etc.  I brought this to the doc attention who was on the chemo ward at that time. They said this is normal.... after surgery and treatment etc.... in the last month I thought I was going mad and feeling a lump on my neck. I thought it was my glands as I'd feel it and the other times I couldn't thought it was in my head and in fairness people were saying it felt fine too.... but recently I've noticed it and it hasn't gone. My right side is defo swollen... Went to the gp who saw what I ment but thought maybe body fighting infection but said to say to oncologist. Rang onc nurse who referred to prof. Was due to have a ct scan yesterday to keep an eye on pelvic  spots from original scan but that was cancelled and pet ordered to look at whole pic ie. Neck too.... I'm a total mess as... 1. I'm kicking myself that I didn't go sooner but genuinely thought was part of chemo pains etc. 2... just so so nervous outcome results.... just everything that I won't be around to see my little girl grow up....  Any advise/help/experience really appreciated. Xx",
