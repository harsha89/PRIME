I promise it does get better.  Use your friends and family to help and dont be frightened to say... I have had enough and need to rest.  Sending loads of love... feel free to message anytime.",

      "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy and reconstruction on the 12th March... now have a new pert boob! I can honestly say that there was very little pain, yes it was uncomfortable at times but was controlled by paracetamol.  I am 8 weeks on and feel good.  I still get very tired but feel good and very lucky that it appears that all the cancer was removed.  Talking to others on here has been an absolute god send, others understand how you feel and you can be honest and open.  As Mum's/wife we try to protect those around us... I have found I have had to put that to one side and try and tell others how I feel.   Some advice that I received that I found invaluable, get a v shaped pillow, some soft crop tops (front fastenings) for later, button through tops and nighties/pj's and treat yourself to a smart shoulder bag to carry your drains around!!!  any excuse for a new bag! I was only in hospital for 3 days and then at home and looked after by district nurses who have been brilliant.  Talk to your breast nurse, they are fantastic and help and support you through this. Being positive really does help, of course I get my off days where I have a good cry, but they are few and far between.  I am now looking forward to getting back to driving longer distances and getting back to work in a few weeks. Take care, look after yourself, and be kind to yourself... Happy to share more of my experience if you want to hear more!!!  LOL",
