      "Content": "Thank you Sheilay for thinking of my mum, when I know clearly you have so much on your own plate right now. We spoke about tomorrows appointment earlier. Mum is worried about what they will do to her in terms of more tests where as I've been more worried about practical aspects like her options for treatments. My mum has no spleen, so that concerns me as not sure how that impacts on her ability to have chemo if that's needed. Anyway as I said I'm not jumping ahead, just lay here trying to think what we should ask tomorrow. Last appointment we were just so shocked that neither of us really knew what to say. I used to be a medical nurse, so in some ways think that's why I'm looking at it from the treatment side initially. My mum hates even having her bloods taken as they can never find her veins and always hurt her digging around, so she's just plain scared of it all. That said she just wants the mastectomy over and done as soon as possible so that the cancer is out if her. Don't know about you, but think especially because this has all come up at this particular time of the year it seems even harder to take in. Everyone seems to be rushing around busying themselves with talk of office parties and turkey dinners, whilst you are sat there feeling as if your world just caved in and your suffocating and the thought of Christmas and all that it evokes makes things ten times harder to contemplate. The rest of my family don't know as yet as we have an important family gathering tomorrow evening so decided it was best to get that over with first and also await the surgeons appointment to be armed with all the information and once the family gathering is over mum can look at telling the family in her own way. I have also been thinking of you Sheilay and your family as they most be so very worried about you too. I hope tomorrow brings us something positive to take away despite the obvious negative reason for attending the hospital. And I also hope Tuesday brings you some answers too and then hopefully we can all focus on reality not what we are sat here inventing as our minds are running wild. Take good care of you and speak soon. X",

      "Content": "Sheila you sound like you are in exactly the same place as my mum right now. She was also diagnosed with two masses in one of her breasts this Wednesday following a call back from her routine 3 yearly mammogram. She had repeat mammogram, ultra sound and biopsies at the appointment on Wednesday. We go for an appointment with her surgeon on Monday. All we know so far is that the doctor we saw on Wednesday said even without any biopsy results that she was sure it was definitely cancer causing the masses and that on examination with the ultra sound she couldn't see any evidence of any masses in her lymph gland. She also said my mum is almost certainly looking at having a mastectomy as the masses were quite big. When I asked the doctor she said the masses on the mammogram didn't appear to be attached to the chest wall, but she did also say that they felt bigger in the breast than they appeared on the mammogram. I don't know what we will be told on Monday and no idea if my mum will be having further tests then or getting the results of her biopsies at that appointment. It's been such a shock, as no family history of any breast cancer previously and mum regularly examines her breasts and had noticed nothing and had no symptoms at all. It's extremely scary getting that diagnosis, so can imagine how scared you too must be feeling right now. Already though I've scared myself to death on google, and also now feel a bit more optimistic after speaking to friends who have either experience in that medical field, or have known someone with breast cancer who have fought it and come out the other side. We are just taking things as they come, as without the facts it's difficult to assess what's what. Until Monday we are trying to just do normal things and not get too focused on the what ifs? Negativity serves no purpose especially on your body and mind, so clearly it doesn't help in any way, shape or form. I'm told that breast cancer is very treatable, and has an 80% success rate in the UK and to be honest that's far better than I first imagined on hearing the news. Try to stay calm, confide in someone you trust and relax as much as possible. I can't sleep right now, so know you will most definitely probably in the same boat, but at least this site gives good valid information, and offers support. I'm happy to stay in touch and as you seem to be in a very similar situation it might be nice to be able to offload as at similar stages right now and having similar fears. Take good care and focus on the positives not the negatives, and stay away from google as it holds good but also bad information. Lorna x",

      "Content": "Hi Sheilay Mum has actually got 3 tumours in her right breast not just the two they originally told us about. They are approx 3cm, 2cm, 1.5cm possibly bigger in his opinion in the flesh than on the mammogram and apparently its an aggressive type of lobular tumour, the surgeon said he's almost certain it will also be found in the lymph nodes so wants to take those out to be on safe side & he said in his experience if it's in the right breast eventually it's likely to be found in the left also, so recommends an outright double mastectomy. Shes having an MRI scan in next week or so to see if any further spread & listed for surgery 27th of Dec and we will know after that what other treatment is indicated. The surgeon & breast care nurse were both lovely and both very open and honest, but also allowed opportunities to ask questions. Mum seems chilled, focused and very calm still. She had raiki and puts her calmness down to that? Whatever it is I'm just glad she is as calm as she is as its helping me stay the same too. She's obviously worried about the surgery side, but just wants it done and out of her. Will be thinking of you & hope that you get some positive news today at your follow up appointment. We will be telling the rest of the family tomorrow, which I'm not looking forward to. We had a special family occasion this evening, so decided to hold back on telling everyone until after this as it didn't seem fair bursting their bubble. Just wish I could go back couple of weeks and freeze time, but clearly I can't. Sending positive thoughts to you & hope you get favourable results. Here if you need an ear anytime x",
