When I had the biopsies before surgery they believed it to be grade 2 but unfortunately it turned out to be grade 3. I'm due to see the oncologist in a couple of weeks to discuss whether I will be having chemo but my consultant was of the opinion that the oncologist may think that the side of chemo could outweigh the benefits due to my age of 73. Any thoughts on this please. Hazel x",
