      "Content": "Like a lot of people I m scared of chemo having alwaus avoided chemicals as much as poss. I was diagnosed with B.C on May 23rd through following up a small lump under my arm. It was a lymph node that was biopsied and declared clear a year ago.However needle biopsy showed cancer cells and had to wait a week worrying before mamagrams and ultrtascans finalyy found a small lump in my breast. MRI confirmed just the one lump of 1.5 cm so had to have lumpectomy on June 23rd plus nodes removed. I need anther small op to get a wider margin in one section but thats been delayed due to seroma/infection.Just had week in hospital on intravenous antibiotic. If 100% o.k. will be having my day surgery on Aug 4th. Then will come the discussion/decision about chemo. As 9 out of my 22 nodes were affected I feel I might have to go ahead, though reluctantly. (my scans were clear) I would like to hear from anyone who could say that sidee effects were manageable and if pos. what helped.",

      "Content": "Many thanks for you info - really appreciate it. I am probably too much of a worryguts - as my daughter in Spain said she knows I like to read up on everything but it can sometimes leave you in a spin weighing up all the pros and cons. I have pretty much accepted that I have to have the treatment and the Marsden (which Kingston is afiliated with) is one of the oldest established hospitals so no point in wondering if any other hospital would offer a better regime....and I cant afford private treatment so no point dwelling on that (thougfh I doubt you get any better choices in drugs, probably just more time or comfort able surroundings ?) So my main focus at the moment is trying to rebuild my immunity after all the antibiotics from the wound infection and read up on good nutrition. At least I have a week before I have blood test and see the Oncologist. and another week before I start on the 15th. Thanks again Jeanette",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for replying. I live on my own even though I Have a partner of 2 years (I was widowed 5 years ago) and he is very supportive but it is still scary.One daughter lives in Spain and the other in Devon. so it is good to have people to confer with. Gemma (Devon) came up for few days when I was first diagnosed but was so stresses out with anxiety that she actually made me feel worse !! She has calmed down now and will be here after my mini op. Am hoping no complications this time. You probabaly are right about chemo although my main concern is longterm nasty effects....I think I can grit my teeth and get through short term stuff , its the thought of other damage that bothers me, like a hormone one that gives increased risk of vaginal cancer ?? So yes will keep in touch as the more info the better.",

      "Content": "Hi Noj You answered me when I asked about chemo. I have now seen the Oncologist from Royal Marsden covering his colleague who was absent from Kingston but gather they folow the same regime.In fact though they say 'this is the best regime for you' I think what they mean is we use these drugs for your pattern of cancer ie I am oestrogen pos not herceptin.so will get FEC but 6 lots. I would like to read your blog but as am very new to these kind of sites woould appreciate guidance how to get to it !! Hope you dont mind me me asking on this - I do feel somewhat computer illiterate ! sincerely Jeanett (Picola)",
