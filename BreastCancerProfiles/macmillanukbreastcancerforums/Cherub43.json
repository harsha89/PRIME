      "Content": "Hi Girls....Forion, Katrina40, Katie54, Sarah32, Bev51, Oldhat and all the ladies on this forum. Hope that you are all resting and remaining positive. I can say that I am usually full of beans until wednesday this week, I was told that my white cell count was low and have to wait a week. Hopefully, I will have chemo next thursday, followed by a drug 24hrs after chemo to stimulate white cell growth. I was a little tearful yesterday, due only to the fact that my chemo would have to be delayed by a week......ahhhh! I mean girls...can you believe me upset because of having to wait a week...Anyone else would be happy to have a week of chemo...smile!  Anyway, to cheer myself up a little I went to town for a short while untill the legs said....no more walking... I managed to buy a picture frame for a beautiful pic from my sister. I also managed to buy some of those sea bands which are good for nausea during chemo. Girls, you can get them at any chemist. I have also been signed off from work for another 2 months...I will not be thinking about work for a while now until I am fully recovered.... Anyway, Girls have a lovely weekend. I plan to rest, rest, rest....From Cherub43.x",

      "Content": "Hi Girls....Hope you are all hanging in there! Hi Katrina40, It would be good for us women if the national screening went down to age 47.Like you it would not have helped me, as I was 42 when I was diagnosed. Again, mine was found by me feeling a lump and then Doctor checking for me.I am glad of the regular checks post treatment, and hopefully they can keep an eye on what's happening if anything. Katie54, Thanks for sharing your story with us -about you and your husband on holiday. Glad that you got your mammagram 12 months earlier....Thank God. The earlier detection for us the better. Noj, I am glad that your mammagram was clear.I know that it can be sore...but at least you are ok. Chrissi, I am hoping to have my 3rd chemo this week, and I can say that your body adapts to it all. I had lots of side effects after 1st chemo, and then things slowed down a little. I am hoping bloods are ok this thurs for chemo. I too had some indigestion, nausea, mouth ulcers ....the lot. I took lots of natural ginger. My dry hands I used a cream called Aveeno-very good, as is E45 cream. Bev51, I am on FEC also, and I find the Cyclophoshamide affects me the worst......my head aches, I want to sneeze and feel really congested......yuk!! I hope that you enjoyd your tool fair. I am feeling a little isolated as white cells down. I am trying to be extra carefull in case of infection....that's about me for now until I feel a little better in myself. Oldhat, You are right...It is fascinating to read about others. I feel that I am not alone and that gives me strength and courage to fight on even if I feel a little low. Delilah, Hi there...I was diagnosed on the 31st Dec last year. I am waiting for no 3 chemo, had horrible side effects after the 1st one. I think that my body is trying to settle a bit now, but I have a very low white cell count. Hopefully, they will try and boost up cells with an injection of Pegfillgrastim. This injection stimulates growth of white cells. All the best with treatments and try to stay positive. That's all for now girls, and I am sorry if I have forgotten anyone. Much love from Cherub43xx    ",

      "Content": "Hello Girls,  Hope that you are all well and remaining very positive. Hi to Katie54, Bev51, Katrina40, Wendy Darling, and all the other special ladies out there. I am currently in my Neutrapenic Stage. I am not feeling too....bad.....just a little tired at times. I even went shopping today bought lots of colourful fruit and veg-Anything to encourage eating. I prepared  BBQ Chicken, veg and potatoes...yum. I am hoping to have 3rd chemo on 11th march, and am glad that I have done quite well...The only thing that upsets me is the sickie feeling after chemo, the horrible taste in mouth and tiredness. This only tends to last about 4 to 7 days post chemo, and then I start to pick up a little. Oh, all my hair has gone, but I am still beautiful...smile. I have really pretty wigs to wear and have fun with them. I was always so girlie before my cancer diagnosis with lota of hair and pretty nails, but I know it will all come back once I am better. I am hoping to do so much once I am better, and looking forward to being able to share my experiences with others. I think that I may treat myself to a cruise some time.....and to totally pamper myself for the rest of my life......sounds good...What do you think?? Much love to you all. From Cherub43xx    ",

Such a great feeling to have so much support from lovely people who are going through similar situations to myself.

It gives me so much strength to know that I am not alone with my cancer. I am able to find so much help and tips from your messages here on this forum. Thank you all. At first when I was diagnosed with breast cancer..I only thought of the ending, but now I see a light at the end of the tunnel. Some days are good, and some are not so good, But I know it will be ok in the end. I am due to have my 3rd chemo this week if bloods are ok...I will be half way through my chemo...hope I will not be feeling too...poorly post chemo, as I tend to be very sick with nausea. I have heared of something called sea bands-can get them at the chemist to put round your wrist for nausea and sickness. I am also listening to my body girls....If I feel hungry like now I eat. The weight will drop once I am better and the gym and personal trainer will always be there for me to get back my shape.....smile! Anyway, Girls take great care. From Cherub43.xx ",
