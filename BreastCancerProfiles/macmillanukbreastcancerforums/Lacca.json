      "Content": "I am 8 sessions into 15 radiotherapy sessions and I have found it emotionally and physically challenging.  I am fortunate to have a group of loving friends who have been supporting me since diagnosis and who, individually,  have been accompanying me to my appointments.  I made the decision to invite them to come into the radiotherapy room with me, to see the machine, meet the radiographers and, most importantly, witness what I am experiencing.  They watch the process through, as I am measured and moved and then go with the radiographers once everyone has to leave to watch as the treatment is administered.  I found it hugely helpful for many reasons; I don't feel alone, I remain human and not just a body, I don't have to explain anything afterwards about why I am emotional or drained or exhausted or all of these, I am seen, I am witnessed and in that witnessing I am cared for.  It is very beneficial to my well-being. ",

      "Content": "Acupuncture helped me going through the menopause as did reducing food that takes a lot of effort to digest; cheese particularly (I cut out all dairy) and alcohol, particularly white wine.  I slept with towelling dressing gown near to bed so when I woke and was drenched, I just put the dressing gown on and went back to sleep.  Having a variety of layers on the bed is helpful...sleeping with a top sheet, then duvet for example. Best wishes",

      "Content": "I am in first week of radiotherapy.  I am struggling with the 'at least its not' responses when talking about my experience of going through diagnosis and treatment.  It was 'at least they caught it early', 'at least you don't have to have chemotherapy', 'at least its only three weeks of RT' and so on.  It causes me to feel that I have no right to feeling distressed and emotional about what is happening.  It causes me to feel muted in trying to talk about what is actually happening to me because the response is always about what it isn't (at least it's not) rather than what it is.  I don't have a way of understanding or interpreting what 'at least it's not' is saying other than...don't moan there are people worse off than you...'at least it's not' is the least comforting phrase I have ever heard",

      "Content": "I am very uncertain about taking the Letrozole.  It feels wrong to totally suppress oestrogen..it is there in the body for a reason.  I am currently undergoing RT after lumpectomy,no chemo as no spread to lymph nodes and caught very early. I am post menopause. I have been exploring how to manage oestrogen production through diet and have been consulting a herbalist to assist.  I believe it is do-able by reducing the production of insulin and avoiding drops and spikes in blood sugar. It is such a very difficult decision.  At the moment I am seeing how I am on the diet..do I think I can maintain it?  What will my quality of life be like taking this approach?  What will my quality of life be taking Leterozole?  Whatever my decision ultimately can I stand by it?  My friends say, and I believe them, that they will support me whatever my decision but I know they worry about me not taking the tablets and I think; what am I willing to put them through?  What would it mean for them if I got ill again?  What would it mean for me? You have been through so much and I think, before any decision is taken, that a holiday would be a good thing...a proper restful holiday that allows you to remember yourself and re-connect with caring for yourself outside of having cancer. I wish you the very best Warmest",
