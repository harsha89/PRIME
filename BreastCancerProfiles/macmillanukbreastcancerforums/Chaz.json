I am struggling with the side effects, sore mouth and fatigue being just 2 of them. These are the reasons I am searching for information about an alternative.",

I'm seeing my oncologist this Friday so I will be asking if there is something else I can take instead, but I'd like to go to the appointment with as much information as I can so I don't get fobbed off...Ive not found out anything yet, can anyone help?",
