      "Content": "Well, I have been reading some entries in the past weeks but have not feel ready to post until now. I suppose I was waiting for a point where it felt settled. So... mum had the CT scan results and other than the bone secondaries (which we knew about) there is no other cancer - amazing!! However we only found out when we did (12pm on a Sunday night) because mum was taken off to hospital 5 days after her first chemo due to sepsis and general bad reaction to chemo. However following huge amounts of antibiotics she returned home after 5 days and has been improving since. BUT the 2nd chemo is tomorrow so we are all a little anxious as to whether it may all start over again soon. Mum has bought a posh expensive wig which looks fab and she has her Blue Badge and Free Prescription certificate. Just waiting for DLA outcome and I need to sit and fill in the application for the new version of incapcity benefit with her. So although there is good news and things have levelled off, I can't help but feel weird. My husband just doesn't get me at the moment and thinks I am looking for fights which I don't think I am. I just feel different - everything has changed and I am not sure he appreciates to what extent. Anyone else experiencing similar, I know I am not the one ill or having the treatment but it has certainly changed something in me - but I can't say what. Anyway, thanks for 'listening'. x",

      "Content": "Well, chemo was cancelled for today as they need to investigate some stomach cramps and ongoing diaheroa but CT scan and x-rays haven't highlighted anything so the internal camera test will be needed. Hopefully that won't be too awful for mum and it will be all clear. Yep, things are different in my head. I am just considering everything differently and I have little patience for other peoples minor ongoing grumbles that don't bother doing anything about them. It's things like that I changed my view on. I suppose I have started thinking about the more immediate future rather than the long term and I have always been a person to do things I enjoy and live for now but somehow as already said its different. If anything, why can't people just appreciate what they have got, not bother me when they want to moan and get on with enjoying their life? Ha ha, what am I doing - moaning!!!!",
