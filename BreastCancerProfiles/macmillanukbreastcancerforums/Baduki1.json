He seem to be less keen to do the axillary clearance because of the Lymphoedema risk which I'm aware of but looks like the side effect of Radiotherapy to the armpit are also challenging. Do you mind me asking why you felt so sure about  going for full clearance over radiotherapy? Was it to be sure that you get all the cancer? Please only answer if you feel it's ok to do so:) With Love xx",

I had my first chemo nearly two weeks ago and felt very emotional starting it as I had it pushed back twice due to delays with my surgery and I just wanted to make a start (of ridding myself of cancer). I felt extreme nausea for about 12 hours though not actually sick, tired for a few days then kind of ok. Taking each day as it comes and working out what to eat/drink as my taste buds have deserted me. I've tried to go out every day..even if its for 5 minutes and speak to people which makes me feel connected to something other than my next chemo session. Let us know how you get on. this is a great place for support...Best wishes xx",
