      "Content": "Hi Willow I think perhaps you should involve your GP and get her to chase it up for you. I did it the other way round. Got all tests done on NHS. Got my diagnosis and results Monday going for second opinion and being treated privately with my insurance company but probably goin with original NHS surgeon. You have to commence treatment within 31 days of first being diagnosed. Hope this helps. Good luck",

      "Content": "I had an inverted nipple 4 years ago. Nothing found. In August this year I was found to have large tumour. Took 4 years. I did not have the sense to have frequent checks. It's good that nothing showed but keep checking. So easily treated when small. Hope this helps with your mum",

      "Content": "Hi Devon I wanted to reassure you. I was in exactly the same situation. Large tumour and a month before I had a treatment plan. There is so much worry when you don't know exactly what will happen. But behind the scenes everyone is working hard to get a plan ready. I am sure that like your wife my tumour had been there a long time and a few more weeks will make no difference. Her team will be aware of this and I am sure that things would have been arranged if it was urgent. I have started chemo to shrink my tumour. It's a bad time right now but hang on in there. Things will get better and you will worry less when you know your wife's treatment plan",
