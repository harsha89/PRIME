    "Content": "Hello everyone, this is my first posting on here and this particular thread has grabbed my attention. Firstly I do think it right that Chloecat should be able to question conventional as opposed to alternative treatments in respect to her own personal diagnosis and beliefs, that is her right but I am not sure that this forum is the correct place to do so as i assume that Macmillan support only evidence based treatments? My worry is that many people in the general populus are unable to understand real scientific research enquiry and distinguish it from pseudo-scientific research. I am a nurse myself and hold a Bsc Hons in Psychology which does require an in depth analysis into research methodology and statistical analysis of data. It takes years of study and training to be able to analyse research findings accurately. One can always find a research project to support an individual's ideas but that does not necessarily prove that , that theory is correct. One of the greatest scientific research Philosophers of our time 'Karl Popper'  argued that \"scientific theories are distinguished from non-scientific theories by a second sort of boldness: they make testable claims that future observations might reveal to be false. This boldness thus amounts to a willingness to take a risk of being wrong. On Popper\u2019s view, scientists investigating a theory make repeated, honest attempts to falsify the theory, whereas adherents of pseudoscientific or metaphysical theories routinely take measures to make the observed reality fit the predictions of the theory.\" As a nurse I will only accept evidence based treatment that has been shown to work through vigorous scientific enquiry, I would certainly not risk my life to some pseudo-scientific theory. I was diagnosed with Her2 positive, Oestrogen and Progesterone highly positive grade 3a - size 8cm in total in situ ductal BC with 3 different stages of cancer cells including widespread DCIS in May last year. I had 6 cycles of Docetaxel, Pertuzumab and Herceptin followed by a further 9 months of Herceptin and now 10 years of Tamoxifen/Letrozole. After 2 cycles of chemo my tumour had shrunk by a half and after histology done post complete mastectomy and removal of 6 lymph nodes I was shown to have had a complete pathological response to the chemo - no living cancer cells detected. All soft tissue and bone scans clear :) Yes the side effects were hell and yes I continue to have hot flushes and some other changes due to the Tamoxifen but  I am still alive, my body has almost recovered from it's poisoning and I am now looking forward to living a full and active life after just one year out of that. My Oncologist expects me to live a long life and die of something else not cancer related. I think the brave warriors are those that stick to the conventional treatments and put up with the side effects for a better, scientifically researched outcome than those that don't. Recently I sat next to a farmer at a friend's dinner party who spent the entire evening telling me that he would never get cancer as he drank some special Green Tea concoction each day containing Apricot kernels (which incidentally contain high levels of arsenic) He then said that if he did get cancer, which he had already said he would not, then this concoction would cure him! I found this not only intensely irritating but also extremely sad. Totally with you ArgyMargy and hoping we all get where we want to be xx",
