I had 8 lots of chemo slyogether.  I had an MRI scan between chemo 4/5 and after 7.  My tumour had gone completely.  I then had a PE on the day I was supposed to have last chemo and ended up in hospital for 4 days.  Yhey still gave me my ladt chemo 4 days after. It maybe because I've got TNBC so I didn't miss any but they did reduce my last one down slightly.  I had op 6 1/2 weeks after last chemo.  It got delayed because of PE - fingers crossed I get good results on 18th!! Can you have a chat to your BC nurse.  I find mine really good if I'm in a quandry.  She can also ask some questions and liaise between surgeon snd Oncologist. Good luck x",

Wasn't thinking straight! I'd rather them be safe, obviously don't want to end up croaking it from an embolism.  I think it's like you say, you have it all planned out and then it goes tits up (excuse the punn) and you just want to get back to some kind of normality. Will feel better once there's a plan of action again. Thanks again ladies Lisa xx",

      "Content": "I've just got back from a meeting with an anaethetist (not sure of spelling) at the hospital as I am due to have my operation on the 26th of November. I had to see him as I suffered a pulminary embolism on 5th October, which should have been my last chemo - my 8th chemo. I had a hospital stay of 4 days and then had my final chemo 3 days after. Before all this happened, my op was due to be on the 7th Nov. He's basically said he feels it's too dangerous for me to have the op.  It's a big op and he says there's a high risk of another embolism.  I'm on blood thinning injections at the mo.  He said if I had another embolism during op or just after op, it's difficilt to treat and stop the bleeding. They may look at just checking my lymph nodes.  As far as I know, they are clear at mo but won't know until they're tested. He's going to speak to the surgeons, the hospital that treated me for the embolism (as he hasn't got all the written records from them, ie. How big it was, was it just the one etc) to see where we go from here. I know it's better to be safe than sorry but will now be worrying about the cancer spreading, especially as I haveTNBC as I don't know how long it will be delayed for .  The fear if the unknown I suppose. The chemo did work in the fact that it got rid of my tumour. Sorry for waffling!!",

I am still going to have an op on the 26th but my op is now going to be in 2 stages so I'm not under general anaesthetic too long.  Anaesthetist didn't want me to have my original big op because the longer you're under, the higher the risk. So on 26th will be having lumpectomy and lymph nodes biopsy.  One surgeon will do one procedure, whilst another surgeon will do the other. Should take about an hour rather than 3 hours + I will then have radiotherapy and my reconstruction in a few months when the anaesthetist is happy. I'm so relieved, felt like I was in no man's land yesterday and worried about what was going to happen. Am glad I'll be able to go back to work for a bit too early nect year.",

Saw my surgeon on Friday morning.  She informed the anaethetist that they had got my op down to an hour and  reconstruction would be done later on.  He still wants the i's dotting and the t's crossed. They normally like 12 weeks of blood thinning injections to have dispersed clot, mine will be about 8 weeks. She has spoken to Haematology who seems quite happy for it to go forward. I'll be mobile after, it's not like I'm having a knee op and won't be able to move. I would also have the massaging leg wraps on during op and during the night. My surgeon was also trying to get hold of the Respiratory team and finding out who the anaethetist is supposed to be for ny op. So I now have an energency CT scan tomorrow and an Echogram on Weds to see if everything is ok to go ahead.  They're aiming for 26th but there could be a delay of 4 weeks worst case.  She is aware that I'm TNBC so knows how important it is to get op done. I'm really grateful thst they're looking after me but just want it done.  Don't want to be worrying about it spreading. Thanks for listening.",

On my first course of FEC I had the runs for 2 days and my second, I had the worst constipation I've had throughout all my chemo. Had my third FEC Friday so third time lucky!!

I was originally down to have op on 7th Nov but has been postponed until 21st as I got a blood clot the same day I was supposed to have last chemo. I just wondered how it went and what your recovery time was like? Many thanks",

Yesterday we did another 9 mile walk with a couple of hills.  It's so lovely to get out.  We parked up at the livery yard where we keep our horses and set off.  Seeing lots of things I'd never see in a car, lots of hidden gems. We're hoping to do the Cleveland Way next year over a week, so this year is for me to get my fitness back. I got the great news just before Christmas that I was cancer free (I had TNBC).  Have still got to have rads shortly so will probably be smaller walks again for a while.",

The only tips I would say for Docetaxel are to make sure you take your steroids to avoid allergic reactions (I didn't take mine properly second time)!! and to rest up afterwards.  I felt fine the day after but was the day after that I felt a bit off so I learnt just to take it easy.

I had my moments with chemo, I didn't have anything horrendous but sometimes it was the drip, drip effect of the chemo, ie. One day I might be a bit constipated, the next my taste buds were off but it's very doable.  Everyone is different.  If you're ever unsure about anything, just ask, there are plenty of lovely ladies, and some men, to answer any questions.",

      "Content": "Hi GILLY66 I had a full pathological response to chemo and had a lumpectomy, even though the tumour had gone.  They explained to me, even though there was no longer a tumour they still took away the same amount as the size of the tumour plus a bit more. As I'm not big busted they didn't know if this would leave quite a dent (my tumour started at 2.7cm) but wasn't as bad as I thought.",

      "Content": "Hi Lellyv What chemo are you having? I started with 4 x Docetaxel, followed by 4 x FEC. I did find Docetaxel a bit tougher than the FEC. I wasn't sick either.  If you're getting headaches from taking Oncadestron, have a word with your team, they'll probably change your medication. I couldn't drive for about 5 or 6 days after having Docetaxel as I felt very shaky and seemed ti have a bit of trouble with my eyes. I also lost my tastebuds which was annoying.  I think when you have your first chemo, it's the not knowing what to expect and what's normal.  I made a note of how I felt each day to see if there was a pattern.  After a couple of chemo sessions, I just seemed to get used to the side effects. I took each one as it came and kept thinking I was one step nearer to kicking it after every session. Didn't get purple boobs so can't help you on that one. Good luck with the rest of your treatment.

      "Content": "@lellyv The lack of taste buds was horrible.  I like my food and found that a really hard side effect.  I can rwmember really fancying a Sunday dinner then couldn't eat it as it didn't taste right and thd texture wasn't good.   Yes Docetaxel is the T bit of FEC-T (Taxotere).  FEC is quite harsh on the veins.  If you're having chemo first before op, try and take it in turns with your arms to save your veins a bit. I've heard different people say they weren't supposed to eat different things but  I was never told not to eat snything.  I just ate whatever I fancied so that I was eating something.  I had quite a sweet tooth to be honest. It must be tough doing it on your own.  Just listen to your body and if you need to rest, make sure you do. I was given a 24 hour number to ring if I felt ill or was unsure about anything.. They were lovely.  I rang them a few times at the start of chemo because I didn't know if some of the things that were happening to me was normal or nit  They often put my mind at rest. It is scarey. I used Corsydll Daily Mouthwash too and was lucky, didn't get many mouth ulcers.  If you have any questions, just ask. Lisa x",

      "Content": "Thankyou SarahSS123 It seems such a journey at the beginning but you'll soon be putting it behind you.  The other way of looking at having chemo first, is you can see how your cancer reacts to chemo and if it's working and it is.  I know it's an anxious time but keep thinking that.  FEC is a good bc chemo too. Take care xx",

They struggled when I ended up in hospital with my PE too trying to put a cannula in, ended up with it in a vein near my wrist bone! Let us know how you get on.   Lisa x",

I can't say my lump felt grissly and then was softer.  Our boobs are quite bumpy and grissly anyway so I shouldn't worry too much. I think it's easy to worry about things and wonder if things are ok. Speak to your Oncologist next time, I'm sure they'll  put your fears at rest x",

FEC did wonders for my tumour aswell as Docetaxel.  Half way there, that's brilliant!! I'm sure missing the odd one won't have done too much harm, your body needs to be fit enough to cope. I think everything will be fine Tues, let us know! Xx",

I had 8 x chemo and 15 x radiotherapy (finished last one 5th March) and had a lumpectomy end of November. I just wanted you to know that the chemo is very doable and I had amazing results with it.  Got rid of my tumour and got clear margins and nothing in nodes. Please don't Google about TN - it's really outdated and doesn't show it in the best light.  Xx",
