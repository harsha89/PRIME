    "Content": "Hi. I wanted to add my experience. 24 years ago I underwent chemo and this was before the cold cap had been invented and my doctor asked me to try a new theory out and I did. I sat with an ice cooler plonked on my head with a bandage to tie it on whilst receiving my chemo. I lost no hair at all where the ice cooler had connected to my head, and lost all my hair where it didn't quite reach so I would definitely recommend the cold cap. It seemed to work for me! x",
