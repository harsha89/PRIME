    "Content": "Hiya Meggie,  Try not to worry, I was diagnosed with Angiosarcoma in 2005, mine was not caused through radiotherapy though so is classed as primary as they do not know where it came from.  I am still here and all clear ok so dont read the stuff on the internet as its incorrect.  There are more and more survivors of Angiosarcoma.  WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT though is DO NOT LET your doctor decide your treatment/surgery etc...you need to demand a Sarcoma Specialist - I know that sounds harsh as you have enough to think about and we hate upsetting our lovely doctors BUT its YOUR life not theirs, so make sure you get referred.  I used the NICE guidelines and am now under the Royal Marsden as they are the experts and leading cancer hospital.  But hopefully there will be a clinic where you are.  We have an amazing facebook group as well...so come and join us.  Here for you ok my lovely.  We have another lady in exactly same position as you so it would be good to speak with her.  My beautiful friend Queen of Swords emailed me about you my friend and this is the reason why I have joined this community to come and talk with you.  I AM NINE YEARS ALL CLEAR and no sign of it coming back...so do not feel hopeless ok.  Hugs and love to you xxx",
