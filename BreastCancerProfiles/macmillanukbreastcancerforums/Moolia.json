      "Content": "Have Never checked my breasts regularly but as I had gained a few pounds decided to look at myself in mirror in just my underwear . As I breathed in hoping to look slimmer I noticed a dimpling effect under my nipple. I was aware this was a sign of breast cancer so checked for a lump. I detected a small lump and went to docs who then referred me to breast clinic where I had a mammogram,ultra sound and biopsy. I was told the same day that it looked cancerous and to prepare for bad news. Whilst waiting on my results  that were booked for following week I noticed a tenderness in other breast so felt again and found another lump but knew I was seeing consultant in a couple of days so didn't panic too much. My consultant confirmed I had breast cancer in first boob and sent me for another biopsy on second one to then be told I had this in both breasts. I had a bilateral mascectomy just before Christmas with a total clearance of nodes under one arm as there was a suspicious looking node and only a few from other arm. Had results yesterday had grade 1 tumour and have 4 nodes and in other it was grade 2 with none involved so see oncologist and have ct scan next week and should start chemo by end of Jan. This has been such a rollercoaster of emotions but cannot knock nhs cause from finding lump to having mascectomy was all in about 7 weeks.  Petrified of cat scan in case they tell me it's spread but reading some of your stories on here makes me hopeful.    And fears ",
