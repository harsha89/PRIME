    "Content": "Hi Sue I am sorry that you are feeling rubbish. I am having a WLE next month and then radiotheraphy for DCIS. People keep telling me how 'lucky' I am that I do not need a masectomy and that I do not need chemo and that it has been found before it became invasive. Of course I do know that I have 'dodged a bullet' but should I feel lucky?  no, I don't. I know there are people everywhere & on this group who do have things much worse than me.  But I am still entering a world that I do not wish to enter. I totally get how you feel. I am sorry that you don't feel that your boob looks okay since your surgery. Have u seen your consultant about this? Is he able to do any further reconstruction for you. I guess I am 'lucky' or maybe fortunate that my boobs are on the bigger side - but I may still end up with one bigger than the other. My consultant has suggested some surgery on the other boob to make them even - though I am still not sure. I am sure you will find a lovely outfit for your neices wedding - do you have a nurse who can advise you on what kind of bra will be more comfortable? Please try and stay positive -  I guess we need to remember that it is easy for people to use the wrong terminology when they say we are lucky or that we should feel grateful.... it is probabaly partly relief on their part too. Relief for them that they do not have to watch us going through more serious treatment. None of us say the right thing sall the time - I am sure your partner didn't mean to upset you. We all have meltdowns at some point - I got my final diagnosis and treatment plan last week (and confirmation I could keep my boob) and was fine until I read something on here about someone getting a kitten - it was such a nice story but it just forced a meltdown ( I have cats) and I then met my friend and sobbed about someone elses kitten rather than my situation. It's normal to feel angry and sad and  a bit crazy & unable to cope; but we do cope somehow & you will. Try and go shopping again for an outfit, have a glass of wine, a cup of tea or whatever makes you happy, have another chat with your other half and remember tomorrow is another day. love Lou H",
