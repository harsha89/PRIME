I slept more than an hour or so  I'm really struggling with dry mouth and sheer panic especially when my husband leaves to work on his night shift and I'm alone if I do nod off something startles me into waking   I'm totally physically and emotionally exhausted  My question is how do we get past this and how do begin to prepare ourselves of shouldn't we  I'm totally lost and seriously struggling I hope you are all having a good day today x Reply",

Since my diagnosis on the 13th I'm  now having surgery on Friday I'm hoping some of you ladies  can advise  me . My surgeon have me some options  (obviously he's told me these can change upon him opening me up)   Option one is a lumpectomy with the one cut  from under the arm to the bottom of my Breast as they are taking the first  two  Lynpnodes  And option two  is  reduction  with the incisions are  similar to normal  Breast reduction surgery and a separate  cut under the arm for the nodes  All this will be followed  by radiotherapy and  the tabs to stop the  estrogen  I'm just seriously stuck as to which  to choose  as I am  big busted (not always comfortable as they are going south)  but I don't  want alot more pain also   Did any of you ladies have to make this choice as I'm really struggling  with it all  and need some advice  and my specialist nurse is off until tomorrow  and I feel scared out of my whits and running out of time to decide  So any help and advice would be greatly appreciated   I hope you are all having as good  and comfortable a day as possible  Deb  xxx",
