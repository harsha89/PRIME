      "Content": "3 weeks ago after doing a FNA biopsy and Core Biopsy I was given the great news of no malignent cells found/a benign cyst and to follow up in 6 months. Why have I been recalled for another core biopsy after this time? I'm very confused ...apparently pathology and radiology don't agree. I'm just surprised that I'm still being discussed after having heard good news in the first place. I plan to see my GP and ask questions as I feel that something doesn't add up. Or is this normal protocol? Maxine x",

      "Content": "Thankyou ladies! Apparently the pathologist wants more material. I just don't understand that this is being said 3 weeks later and after I was given the 'result'. The doctor said i'm not at risk to wait until January too.I found the core biopsy quite invasive so I think it's normal that I should have questions considering....",
