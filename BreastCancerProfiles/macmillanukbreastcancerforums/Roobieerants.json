      "Content": "Hello, what you have experienced echoes my own experience. Friends, family, neighbours and colleagues all seemed desperate for it not to be happening and their own fear and upset prompted a kind of fake 'everything's fine' approach. As the centre of the cancer storm it felt like my duty to forge forward with a brave face and join in with minimising what was happening. I totally understand people's need to believe we will be fine but at times their inability to understand our awful reality can leave us very lonely, very isolated. I'm a year on from treatment and although those around me need life to get back to normal (and for the most part it has) it is still early days for me and a level of concern always sits at the back of my mind.  A cancer diagnosis forces you to face your own mortality and as a result you lose a kind of innocence, I don't think it's possible to really understand this as an onlooker but here you will always find someone who gets where you're at.x",

      "Content": "I think you're probably right, the way others react tends to push you to a place of \"I'll deal with this alone\" and to some degree it is you and you alone who is going through this terrible, frightening time but as time progresses you may find yourself needing at least some practical help from those around you and sometimes that helps them too. I think watching someone you love go through the rigors of cancer treatment and feeling powerless to do anything is it's own desperately scary experience so being able to do something practical feels like they're doing something. As a society we are generally rubbish at recognising the value of just allowing someone to be scared or angry or hopeless about their diagnosis without trying to tell them it's going to be ok. Sometimes we don't feel it's going to be OK and don't want to put on a brave face. It is okay to not feel OK, it is okay to feel scared. It is okay to feel a bit pissy with people who are trying to wrap up your cancer diagnosis with a neat bow. We know they are only trying to help but it's still OK to feel annoyed. Will be thinking of you as you move forward with your results.x",

      "Content": "Hi Fiona I'm not sure how helpful my understanding will be but thought I'd offer it up anyway! My understanding is that current 'standard practice' for breast cancer treatment is that if there is any lymph node involvement at all, a lymph node clearance is recommended. When I was diagnosed in August 2015, I was offered the opportunity to take part in a clinical trial that was looking at the benefits of lymph node clearance. My surgeon explained that although current practice suggests removal of all nodes if any are affected, the reality was that in a majority of clearances, only a couple of nodes were found to be affected.  This lead to the consideration as to whether the current standard might need reviewing ie. are we over operating and as such leaving women to manage the additional mobility issues, pain and discomfort of lymphodema which is a side effect of lymph clearance surgery, unnecessarily? Small scale studies were done to look at how current standard treatment would compare to a possible new treatment. Women who  were identified through a sentinel node biopsy to only have 1 or 2 nodes showing cancerous cells were split into two groups a trial group and a control group. The control group were given the standard lymph clearance plus chemo plus breast/chest and or lymph rads. The trail group however were only given chemo and breast/chest rads but no treatment to the lymphs. In these small scale studies the 5 and 10 year survival/outcomes milestones seem to show similar outcomes ie, no detriment to the trial group. This prompted a proper clinical trial (which could change what the standard treatment becomes in future, should the outcomes continue to show similar outcomes in both groups) The benefit to the trial group women ie. no lymph surgery was potentially no lymphodema, at least not in the armpit area. Unfortunately the computer randomised me to the control group (the standard surgery group) which I didn't want! I decided to withdraw from the trial and choose to decline the surgery off my own back as my fear of lymphodema and further aggressive surgery was greater than my fear of breast cancer coming back!  Since then my oncologist has offered me radiotherapy to my armpit area as an alternative to surgery. Again small scale studies looking at surgery versus rads the the lymph nodes are showing similar survival/outcomes at 5 years as having surgery but with a reduction in the chance of lymphodema. I am currently intending to take this middle ground, although not without hesitation. For me it is still about weighing up a quality of life over a quantity of life. Important things to consider are your grade of cancer and its receptor status. Faster growing cancer cells, grade 3s and those that won't benefit from targeted therapies, such as triple negative cancers may well be better dealt with through the lymph clearance as any spill into the lymphs obviously holds a risk, however minimal, of cells moving out of the breast area and metastasising which none of us wants to happen. Please note that this is my understanding only and I have no more medical credentials than you and ultimately your specialists are your best source of info for your particular cancer BUT I do believe taking new information with you to discuss is always helpful, even if only to help you feel that you have had some input and some sense of having checked out all options before making a decision that feels right for you.

      "Content": "Hi Bev I experienced cravings and food aversions and a few mouth ulcers through my  three FEC chemos. I'm now on my second of three Docetaxel chemos and the cravings and aversions and ulcers have gone to be replaced by pretty yucky oral thrush! Throughout all of my chemos my taste buds have been impacted to varying degrees. During FEC as a general rule by my third week of recovery they were improving on Docetaxel however, they didn't fully recover before I had my last infusion. I have used Difflam mouth and throat wash, prescribed by oncologist-was advised against using Corsodyl. I used bonjela on ulcers and a saliva replacement gel called Biotene for mouth dryness. For the thrush I'm using Daktarin gel. I agree with the others regarding drinking as much water as you can-it helps on many levels, not least of all supporting your liver and kidneys to flush out the toxic chemo! As for food and drink, as with the others here who have responded-trial and error and it definitely seems to affect everyone differently. I've eaten all sorts of rubbish and put on the weight to prove it but ultimately I trust that my body knows what it needs and when this is all over I can focus on getting back into a healthy regime! Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi Loolyboo I had left breast mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy on 5th Oct and didn't start chemo until 10th Dec-9.5 weeks later. The main issue the wait caused me, so far, is that my SSP runs out in a month and I still have one more chemo to go and then four weeks of radiotherapy! The key first line of defence, as others have pointed out already is your surgery. So sorry to hear you now have shingles to deal with, as if you don't already have enough to contend with. X",
