    "Content": "Hi barb I know this post was 2 yrs ago and I hope you don't mind me contacting you.  I'm in NW England and have had 'challenges' with my oncologist throughout my treatment. I've finished all treatment in mid October 2016 and have been talking to GP about blood tests for cancer markers. You mention in your post that you were looking elsewhere for a second opinion-did you do this and if so where and was it worth it? Like you I know treatment options are limited and I avidly look at research etc to see what progress has been made. Best wishes ",
