    "Content": "Am in similar situation as Wasfit@50 - lumpectomy followed by full node clearance 3 weeks later. Now on day 9 after my first chemo session (EC-T). The waiting for results seemed to go on forever but when results came through everything happened very quickly. The thought of doing exercises after surgery was daunting but I have had a rotator cuff injury on that side and know that keeping the arm and shoulder mobile is very important. Pressed on with the exercises and it has shown great results. Eight weeks after node clearance I have full movement back and only a slight sensitivity from armpit to elbow. I did get shooting pains and tingling as the nerves started to heal but they didn\u2019t last long. I have to say the surgery was not as bad as I feared it would be. The worst part was worrying about it before hand. Hope all goes well for you youngatheart xx LinDee",
