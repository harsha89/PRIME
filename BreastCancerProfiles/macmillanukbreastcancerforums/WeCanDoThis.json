      "Content": "Hi lulupop, Sorry to hear you have further diagnosis but at least they've got it now. I too had/have lobular grade 2. I wasn't offered mastectomy they just did lumpectomy and now I'm in middle of chemo. I'm continually worrying that they didn't find it all even though like you and others I have been told both CT and MRI are clear. I read on internet that lobular can be hard to spot especially on mammogram. It grows in sheet-like fashion. Maybe it is hard to spot on MRI too. Just hope the chemo is doing its thing, that's all I'm hanging on to. In your case did they recommend mastectomy even though your tumour was small? I didn't get a choice just told we are doing a lumpectomy and you don't need a mastectomy.",

      "Content": "Miss Wolfie and NiceCuppa, I would agree it's the bone marrow injection causing the back pain. Usually I get the bone pain starting about 24 hrs after the Neulasta injection. But on one occasion my first EC cycle the pain arrived on Day 10 and was totally debilitating. I was lucky enough to be in hospital with neutropenia at the time and they were able to give me IV pain relief. Apart from being in labour I haven't experienced pain like it ever before. In my experience the pain is worse if it's delayed, if it starts early then it's doable. Hope you two can find ways to cope with it. I found lying flat on my back gave me some relief. Maybe docs would give you Naproxen or something strong to cope with it.",

Day 4 I was assessed and white bloods were good so discharged. Temperatures continued and I was assessed again on day 7, bloods good again but was started on antibiotics on day8 just in case it was an infection . By day 10 fevers had continued. I was on maximum paracetamol intake to keep the temperatures down. On day10 went and got assessed again and this time they admitted me to hospital because inflammatory markers elevated and was put on IV antibiotics. This is day 14 now and I'm still in hospital and still getting fevers but they are becoming less frequent and are talking about letting me out tomorrow. Oncologist is going to switch me to paclitaxel since he thinks docetaxel is disagreeing with me. Strange thing is that apart from the fevers I seemed to not be getting the other typical docetaxel side effects. What can I say I'm a weird case!!",

All I can say is it gradually settles just take each day one at a time and dont expect too much of yourselves. Try to eat small and often because I found it actually got worse when I didn't eat. I survived on small amounts of porridge and sucking Pineapple Polly ice lollies for a few days. Then when I started to come out of it, in my case about Day 7 or 8, I really felt quite good. I have finished EC now and start on docetaxel tomorrow. I have been reading the 'chemo' tips page and reading back through the chemo forums to try and pick up tips for dealing with the various docetaxel side effects.  Anyone got any more advice for me I'm really nervous and actually starting to feel nauseous already. They have given me dexamethasone 2mg tablets. I have to take 8 of these today, tomorrow and the day after. Is this normal? Do they give you more antisickness tablets to deal with nausea if you get it? Normally when on EC they gave me emend to take tomorrow but they didn't this time. Any advice gratefully received. Thanks everyone",

I took an ear infection 1 week after my first EC and ended up in hospital with neutropenia. My white blood cell count had been severely affected by the EC so I  was unable to fight any infection. Note this was just my reaction to it ,most people do not have as severe a reaction! For the next 2 EC the oncologist reduced the dosage so that this wouldn't happen again. Apart from that my main side effects on EC were nausea, some vomiting, aches and pains, tiredness,sore mouth. I found the nausea the hardest to cope with.In my first EC it lasted for about 2 weeks then I had a good week before the next cycle. For the other 2 cycles of EC I had about 1 week of nausea followed by day by day improvement. From reading on this forum everyone reacts differently to these drugs so don't be thinking your reaction will be the same as mine.  Alot of people cope fine on EC!",

It's really hard coping with all the side effects and also not being as sharp as you normally would. Try not to expect too much of yourself, that's how I feel I coped. I told myself that this was something to get through and took each day at a time.

That particular cancer hasn't recurred in 7 yrs so I guess he was right but I still wish I had pushed for the test just to know the recurrence score  Somebody has to be that 2% (or 6% that my breast surgeon told me, both low %) getting 2 primary breast cancers.

      "Content": "Hi @Nicecuppa, My oncologist phoned me up and told me my oncotype dx score when it came back to him. But that might have been that he was keen for me to get on with chemo since the score was high, 34. In general I found that both breast surgeon and now oncologist seemed to want to give me minimal info and I'm not sure why. I keep asking questions but definitely feel a resistance to sharing too much.",

      "Content": "Hi Haysie, I'm not sure . I think the oncologists advice was probably based on everything. I think he may well have advised chemo anyway because of the weak ER+ .",
