      "Content": "You wonderful lot, I finished my treatment for stage 1, grade 2 hormone positive breast cancer in December. Been on my tamoxifen since 7h December. Last two weeks I\u2019ve been struggling with fatigue and on Thursday of this week, fainted when my BP dropped to 86/52. Is this just general, post cancer, return to work fatigue? Do I need to be worried it\u2019s re appeared ? ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your wonderful reply. Yes I\u2019m a regular checker. I\u2019ve left a message with the breast care team (they\u2019ll think I\u2019m nuts ) but will see GP tomorrow. It feels like a hard mass rather than a specific lump which I haven\u2019t noticed before. Like you say, the MRI would have been done on both boobs. ",

      "Content": "Morning you lovely people,  So, having found a pea size lump in my left breast in August was diagnosed with hormone positive, growth negative invasive breast cancer. Had lumpectomy and starting 4 weeks of radio on 6th November.  Decided to have a feel of my other breast and I\u2019m not happy. I can feel hard masses and I think a small lump. Am I going nuts?? Wouldn\u2019t the MRI I had have been on both breasts?? ",
