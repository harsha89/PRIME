Yes i am a man and i care for the people around me, But some how they dont see what i go through beind sick with side efects of the loads of drugs i take every day. But i keep that and everything else to myself.I am going for my mammagram next week on my own. i have told some of my family and friends about it but not one of them have said anything about it since i told them. You are stronger than you give urself credit for. We do not live in the 1800s..I am sorry but you do have to find some way to get them all to hear you. You have to start thinking of your self. When they want somthing like your daughter wanting to go shoping Tell them no let them be grumpy. I know its easy to say and you have to put up with there selfish ways and there ungreatful moaning please just try. There is help out there for you just ring the numbers others have sent to you.I really wish i could help you more. But i am here for you just like everybody on this site                                                   big hugs Paul x",

It sounds like you have put your family first all through that 7 years. Now its time you have got to put your self first. I just think your hubby and kids have been so use to haveing this strong wife and mum looking after them.They have failed to notice your pain. its for you to think of your self.Tell hubby how bad  you feel and what your going through i am sure he will releise how much  he and the kids have taken you for granted. Thinking your some kind of superwoman.They hopefully will let you get the rest you need and give you some well deseaved TLC. I do hope you get a break somewere and you get to chill out in the sun. Like all the ladys on the site i will alway be here if you need a friend.                          BEST WISHERS pAUL XX",

I must say i have had more support from the ladys on this site than i would get from my  family.Not easy to say but my family wont be intrested in what happens to me. There is no way they would make any efford to go with me, I have been ill with kidney failere 4 4 years I have been in hospatallots of times with infections and even had a brain hammeridge 2 years ago.I was blind for a few weeks.In all that time spent in hospatal ill or having treatment i have not seen 1 member of my family. The only person i seen was my then girlfreind she supported me for almost 3 years before we split up..The support i get from this site will get me through it thats all i need thank you to everybody                                                                     Best wishers Paul",

I think its wrong for your to judge breast cancer in men isnt as devastating as it is for women, Breast cancer in men and women is breast cancer. Men will be treated the same way as women are. The same opps same drugs and all other treatments. I am scared about going for a mammagram next monday.But i have to go. I can only guess that every woman that finds a lump like i did gos through the same feelings as i am. This site has been the only support i have. Some replys have been supportive and have helped me with information.i have 1 more week to go.thats 1 week of sleepless nights 1 week of days with in on my mind.i still have to get on with life, eat drink do everyday things. plus i have to go to dialysis 3 times a week. I watched my mum go through breast cancer.I havent even told my family about my test next week,Nobody knows.Igo for my tests alone with only the support of you ladys on this site. But if i do have breast cancer i expect to be treated the same way as anybody with breast cancer and i no it wont be easier for me                                                                             paul",
