      "Content": "Thanks Dreamthief. I think I will go and get out my adult colouring book and pens that I got when I was first diagnosed. I haven 't touched them for a while now, and it will certainly help take my mind off things. The cream seems to calm things down then it gets all red again. Trouble is it's so itchy it's probably my scratching making it worse. I certainly have gone back to that awful waiting game that we all have to play, but it's really good to come on here and be able to vent a bit.",

      "Content": "I am so worried I am driving myself crazy. I had a WLE, sentinel node biopsy, and radiotherapy last year which finished just before Xmas. I was told I was very lucky as it was caught extremely early and with no spread to lymph nodes. Fantastic I thought, I'm sorted. This last couple of weeks I have been quite itchy on the treated breast (left). This week noticed a red patch and was given a steroid cream by the GP. He thinks it is just a skin problem and nothing to worry about. I didn't see my usual GP and felt rather that I was fobbed off and just chucked out the door asap with a prescription. I called the breast care unit where I was treated and they have booked me in for a review. I was due one anyway soon. It is on 5th April. Of course being me which is a total worrier (I take medication for anxiety) I have been Googling. I have now convinced myself that I have inflammatory breast cancer. I've gone on to read about prognosis etc. I just don't know how I am going to last until my appointment. Please please help me with suggestions on how to cope. I am going crazy with worry!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. My symptoms were getting worse and this morning it looked different. Of course my mind was working well overtime after worrying like crazy all weekend. I called the breast care nurses this morning and sobbed down the phone. They were fantastic and got me in straight away to see the consultant. Result is that he thinks I have lymphoedema. I have antibiotics and some more cream to use. I am also going for a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. My head tells me, fantastic news, get on  with things as normal now. But you know, even when the consultant assured me I didn't have inflammatory breast cancer (twice!) I just don't believe him. I have now been booked on the local Hope course - how to move on after cancer. I might follow this up with some counselling if I keep feeling like this. It is really good to hear from those of you who have had similar problems. Hopefully the antibiotics and cream will get to work and my symptoms will ease soon. ",

      "Content": "Hi Wendi It's good to hear from someone else who has the same type. It seems only 2% of breast cancers are a pure mucinous tumour so we are obviously both very special people! Thank goodness yours was eventually picked up on your routine mammogram. The screening programme in our area has only just started calling people from the age of 47 - lucky for me, as mine would not have been picked up until much later otherwise. I never felt a lump and was totally shocked when the tumour showed up. Like you I feel very lucky to be here and I will go through my treatment thinking how lucky I am this was detected so early. I lost my Dad in February to pancreatic cancer, and when he was diagnosed it was too late for any treatment - at least I have the best possible chance and lots of treatment options. Love Angie x",

I've been Googling a lot since I was first diagnosed a few weeks back but I'd never hear of this type. I am very lucky in that it has been caught very early and there was nothing in my sentinel node and I had clear margins. So no more surgery and no chemo! I will start radiotherapy soon and am now on Tamoxifen. I just wanted to see if there was anyone else out there who has this type of tumour?",
