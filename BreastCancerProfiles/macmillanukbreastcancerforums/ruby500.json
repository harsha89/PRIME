      "Content": "Hi ladies, I am kind of facing the same problem at the moment and finding the subject a bit of a mine field. I finished Tamoxifen around this time last year, it was my surgeon that said it was time to come off the Tamoxifen (which I could not wait to get back to a kind of normal ) I was feeling really well, came off it there was no mention of after care for my periods coming back or blood test to check the oestrogen levels or anything, was told will see you in a year, well done! It was only till I started having panic attacks out of the blue that my nightmare started and has gone on ever since, only now am I getting them to listen to me instead of being told that I am worrying about nothing and it's normal to feel like that when you finish treatment. There is the problem now of what to do with me as I was hormone positive and my periods have come back although in stops and starts and my hormones are very out of balance, I think I am perimenopausal along with suffering from pmt ( badly ), it astounds me that they can't work it out, but instead they hand you out antidepressants, what a way to finish my all in all good treatment for breast cancer!!!! So it still begs the question do I have the ovaries out to A. stop the cancer coming there and B. Help balance out my body and heavy periods. Sorry Tinker's I have not answered your question but only raised my own. Ruby xxxx",

Sorry rant over. Would love to help Wildbreast Ruby xx",

I'm on my second injection and I am having similar pain to yourself, shoulder joints,  wrists, balls of my feet, and at times it becomes too painful to move my wrists, I have been taking flaxseed oil, also B vitamins and I  try to keep moving, I try not to take pain killers as they block me up, but the flaxseed is wonderful , I try and get my calcium intake from lots of vegetables as I don't eat much dairy.

Ask your GP for a drug called lansoprazole, they will help with the acid and eat  bland food nothing spicy and stay away from onions also try not to eat anything with high fat as your tummy will only have difficulty breaking it down and therefore producing more acid which will then cause more discomfort .

After having my mastectomy way back in 2005 I was in the supermarket with my partner we were stood at the check out waiting for our shopping to go through. The young girl kept looking at my chest then looking back at me and smiling then back at my chest. well at the time I was wearing a scarf as I had lost all my hair due to chemo and was sometimes a little paranoid about people staring at me. When we walked away my other half said \"that was a bit rude, that girl was really staring at you\" to which I replied \" Ye I thought that too\". As we walked out of the shop a huge smile appeared on my partners face which was followed by roars of laughter, as he told me my softie had slid down and had taken up residence on my tummy. We laughed for days afterwards. i hope that has given you all a wee chuckle. xxx",

I am near Edinburgh so I sometimes go to the one at the Western General, I am a lot further down the line to a lot of the ladies on here, I guess I am nearly one of the statistics, I was only 34 when I was first diagnosed. The waiting bit is very hard to deal with but as many have said once the consultants decide what treatments is for you, you will then have that to focus on. I personally think by talking and maybe keeping a diary (daily or weekly) will help.  Also as regards to  going to GP's about anti depressants I would let the water settle for a bit before doing this, I think talking to someone about everything is a good thing, try Maggies and see how you get on. Will be thinking of you Big hugs Ruby xxx",

      "Content": "Having a bit of a moment and feeling very worried about an appointment with my surgeon which is next week.  I had a mastectomy in June 2005 and full axillary clearance everything went fine. Fast forward to about three weeks ago and my hand has been swelling which is not unusual as it does from time to time but this time it was not getting any better. Last Thursday I ended up calling the doctor out as it had become pale and cold.  To my shock and absolute horror he told me that I would have to go to hospital as there may be a chance I could have a blood clot.  So got to the hospital and they did some blood tests and found there was no blood clot and sent me home with some very strong antibiotic. Spoke to BCN and she said that the surgeon would want to see me just to make sure that everything was ok and although the hand is much better I am  scared beyond belief and can't stop shaking. Partner just keeps saying everything will be fine cause he is worried and does not know how to handle it, plus I have to try and keep it together for my 11year old son. Help need some advice !!!!!!",

I must say on the hair thingy I loved the fact that I didn't have to fuss over my hair and no waxing down below. Also I used to wear really cool funky head scarfs. How did you get past the panic attacks? x",

      "Content": "Hi Ellen I have just read your first post on here and it took me back to when I was losing my hair and my best friend was a hair dresser (Thank god)  I had a few of my closest friends over one night and we decided it was time to get the clippers out. I had had very long hair until I was  advised by my chemo nurse to maybe get it cut short so it would not be such a shock for when it did fall out which I did and that was ok, but then we had our night of shaving and although there were tears shed by the girls they were more about the cancer rather than my hair, infact I found it quiet lberating and at the end of the day it will grow back!!! I also used to get neutropenic and have to spend days in hospital, which was so boring cause I was always put in a side room. Good luck with your counts, hope you manage to stay out of hospital, oh and Happy late BDAY. Ruby xxx",
