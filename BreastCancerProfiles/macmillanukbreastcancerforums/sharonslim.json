I am going into my 2nd one, telling everyone that I will be wiped out for about 5 days, then gradually coming back to normal over the following 2 weeks, I have actually felt \"normal\" for the last 8 days, keep taking the anti sickness drugs, my hospital gave me 5 days supply, but went back to docs as still feeling sick, took for about another 5 days then accidentally forgot to take one day and realised I felt ok. This is totally do able and I keep thinking about planning for my \"I kicked cancers butt\" party!! Good luck and hugs xoxo",

I have had a lumpectomy and 2nd op for wider margins and to remove lymph nodes, so not going to apply for any topless waitress jobs! I started off at first very self conscious about my body and all the men that wanted to look and touch me, the turning point was when I went for my heart monitor check and I haven't been wearing a bra since my ops but it was all male nurses doing the checks and my nurse said if you can strip to your bra to allow him to place the sticky pads on me, don't know who was more embarrassed when he came behind curtain and I was topless.. I woke up with nightmares for about a week later.. I try now to think that they have seen loads of women like us and they probably don't even think about it.. Would it help for you to talk to one of the nurses on here or at a Maggie's centre or Macmillan drop in centre? My breast nurse was almost invisible too and I felt like a nuisance, your not in Glasgow by any chance? Good luck for rest of your treatment.. Xx",

I went for the first time last week, I also spoke to a McMillan nurse there and she gave me loads of info eg Maggie's centre. The nurses that you can phone on here are fantastic too.

      "Content": "Hi patriciab... I was diagnosed in July and feel it has been a long journey, if I can give you any advise, ask ask ask ask questions, the worst thing is not knowing and in my case I felt as though I was being a nuisance when talking to my surgeon and breast cancer nurse.. My salvation was speaking to the McMillan nurses, both here and at our local library drop in.. I continually question every little ache/pain, recently had flu and was convinced the cancer had spread to my lungs, anti biotics sorted that out. I am also getting flu jag next week. I start chemo next week and my biggest upset is losing my hair! I try to tell myself that :) all the other side effects will be dealt with if and when ! Use this forum, lots of ladies/men in here can help you through this.. Good luck and it's ok to have a break down every now and again.. Xxxx",
