      "Content": "Hi   I had the same problem and my GP refused to allow me to pay for Femara and really was quite unpleasant but I have since found out that it was her polictics and somehow she felt I was undermining the NHS. I wasn't, I was just in terrible pain and chose to stop spending my money on other things to finance Femara. I got in touch with my oncologist changed my GP and now am able to pay for Femara. The difference in my health is immense and so I really would suggest you try every avenue you can and it really is worth the money if you can afford it. Good luck and keep trying. ",

      "Content": "Hiya   I've been on Femara for 4 months now and fortunately and  fingers crossed for the future, I have had no side effects. I did a lot of research before I started on Letrazole (had a lot of time, laying in bed with an iPad on my lap!) and so many people had trouble with generic letrazole that I decided to fight for Femara. My GP point blank refused to prescribe me Femara as the generic tablets are £6 a month and Femara is £30 a month. She was incredibly unhelpful and fortunately in the end Bupa agreed to fund it and have been wonderful. I hope they don't change their minds during the next ten years or I guess I will have to try and fund it myself. i hope the Femara works for you and be grateful to your GP! ",
