      "Content": "Hi, i think a research project would be a good idea and would be happy to participate.  i would be more than happy to discuss the good and bad points of having a PICC line as i feel there are a few points that could be worked on to make having a line more comfortable. Thanks too for your words on Docetaxel, i have taken it all on board. take care anna",

I must admit i am not a fan of needles, but for me the whole procedure only took about an hour.  I am looking forward to getting rid of it, 4 more cycles to go.",

      "Content": "I didnt know about portacaths until after i had my PICC line in. I totally agree having a line in makes sense, especially hearing about the problems other people are having with their veins. I think my main gripe about PICC lines is that the district nurse team on initial visit didnt seem overly confident with them. I think that adds to an already anxious time. Also i think that i certainly didnt realise just how inconvenient in every day living they would be. Although i will admit,  its worth it to keep some veins. anna",

I can see the convenience of it though as when getting treatment there are no problems finding veins, and so it makes sense. I think the major concern for me though is that the district nurse hasnt had a lot of dealings with them, and again this worries me. I am keeping it whilst i need it but as soon as i dont its coming out.",
