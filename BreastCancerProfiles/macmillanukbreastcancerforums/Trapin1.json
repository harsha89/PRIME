      "Content": "Hi Oksana, I too had WLE back in November and quickly developed swelling under armpit which was a Seroma. Has that been mentioned to you? I had to have it drained and then developed another which I had drained again but developed another which I decided to leave alone and which went away on its own eventually. As someone else described it - it's like having a rolled up newspaper under your arm so you can't quite put your arm down. It was explained to me that because the lymph drainage on the operation side had been removed, your body has to readjust and find other lymph channel to drain though. Thankfully mine seems to have done that now and hopefully yours will too although you could ask about having it drained.  Good luck with it X",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I have recently joined the cancer club (mammogram 3 weeks ago and surgery yesterday). I had lumpectomy and Axillary node clearance yesterday after being diagnosed with invasive ductal (cancer in 1 lymph node found during biopsy) and am now waiting to find out if I will need chemo before radiotherapy. I hap op about 2pm yesterday and was allowed home after drain was removed about 8pm. My query is - I feel remarkably well, pain-free and able to use the affected arm quite well. I'm wondering if this is the calm before the storm. I actually feel a fraud being off work. Most of the reading I have done has been about pain, swelling, numbness etc following this surgery. Am I just lucky or it's not happened YET? Anyone else had this experience? ",

      "Content": "It's a week and 1 day since I had my op and I have been back today for checkup with breast nurse and breast physio. I had noticed some swelling developing under arm in last 48 hours which was beginning to make me feel like I was walking around carrying a rolled up carpet. Turns out it was a seroma which has been drained and I now feel much more comfortable. The nurses gave me a good talking to about how much I've been doing (cleaning windows, vacuuming, etc - although I have been trying to use my unaffected arm) and have made me realise that an axillary node clearance (rather than the lumpectomy) is a big operation. Having thought that I might soon start radiotherapy (provided I don't need chemo) they told me it won't be for at least another 6 weeks until the ANC is fully healed and that I shouldn't be driving for another 6 weeks and probably won't be fit to go back to work until Easter. They were very firm that I must rest and only do light occasional housework (even with my other hand). I just can't get my head around all this because, otherwise, I feel so well and still feel guilty for being off work. It's going to be hard, but I am going to try to follow their instructions because I do not want to develop lymphodaema (I've seen google images)! ",

I found that she had found her BC in November 2016 just like me and pretty much gone through same treatment as me but has subsequently developed secondaries.I don\u2019t know how these were discovered but it sparked a conversation with my brother (who had bowel cancer a few years back) about follow ups when treatment has finished. I just have to wait from year to year for a mammogram but he said in his first few years after treatment he had six-monthly blood tests to check foe cancer markers in his blood. Now, I\u2019m not a pessimist or a worrier but I do wonder - if I\u2019m just reliant on annual mammograms, how would I know it\u2019s not returned elsewhere until I: find a lump, feel unwell, etc, in which case it might be too advanced? My own mum developed secondary oesophagal cancer after her treatment which was too late to treat.  Is anyone else getting any sort of screening apart from mammograms? Should I be asking for regular blood tests? Thank you. ",
