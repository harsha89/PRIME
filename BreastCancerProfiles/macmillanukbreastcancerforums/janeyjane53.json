      "Content": "I have just finished a course of FEC chemo for breast cancer of unknown origin. Apparently I have aggressive ( grade 3) cells which caused a secondary tumour in my lymph nodes( only one thank goodness but they were all removed). But these cells cannot be found, hence the FEC. I am so glad it's over but now face the next steps- herceptine ( and the heart scan which goes with that) for a year and a drug called Letrrosin which I will take for the next 5 years! Is there anyone who can tell me of any side effects they have noticed from these drugs? Is there anyone with breast cancer of unknown origin? Oh and I will be having a mastectomy in the next few weeks and i am worried about the anaesthetic as my veins have been badly affected by the FEC. It feels a lot to be taking in and Would welcome any info from people who have any advice/ experiences to share.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Alison. I have had problems with low white cell count- I really crave steak! Will make sure I eat an iron rich diet before the op, but unfortunately have completely 'gone off' green veg since being on FEC! You must be pleased that your treatment will soon be over. Glad you think FEC is the worst bit of the treatment- you have also made me feel more confident regarding the mastectomy- so thanks for that. I hope you make good progress with the rest of your treatment- it certainly is a beastly journey. Janex",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Highland Mum - I'm glad to think the worst is over, I hope you're right! I was nervous about the effects of herceptine on my heart- good to know the problems are picked up on the scans. My cancer came from nowhere too- just as well we don't know what is round the corner! Good luck for a healthy future. X",
