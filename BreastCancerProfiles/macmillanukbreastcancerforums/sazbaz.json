    "Content": "Jules first of all let me say how sorry i am that you find yourself on this website and the loss of your mum. Don't know if this will help to answer any of the number of questions you must have but I have breast cancer and found the lump in what i tought was a very quick time; unfortunately it seems that mine is aggressive and had spread very quickly into my lymph nodes in chest and neck and now they can only control it. I was told i could have had it for a long time before the lump was noticeable as i had calcifications (small cancerous spots) around my breast. It could be your mum choose to ignore it but on the other hand the lump may not have been noticeable. You could try talking to a Mac Millan nurse who may be able to answer your questions more accurately. Hope this helps a little and remember there is people out there to help you.",
