    "Content": "I lost my mum six months ago to pancreatic cancer, she was a nurse and a very dedicated one. She taught me what nursing is about, compassion, empathy, patience, communication (listening mainly) and advocating patient needs. When I went through what I did with my mum and the rest of the family it made me understand how important these qualities are. It also made me realise how vulnerable it is to be a patient in a hospital and how important it is for health carers to provide holistic care(caring for body and mind). I know what it is like to recieve bad/life changing news, what it is like to have what seems like a never ending worry, losing someone so important, having to adjust to major events. I also have my own disliking to a certain cancer nurse who I feel acted totally unprofessionally towards my mum eg. telling my mum she had cancer, when in fact this wasnt known yet. I will be qualifying as a nurse in Sept and I hope that from everything I have learnt and experienced, I will be able to use effectively. I would like to be known as the nurse that made a difference in a positive way and not the other way round.",
