    "Content": "Hi I have been battling estrogen based breast cancer since 1995. I was diagnosed at 40..today I am 54. I have been in stage IV since the late 90's and was being treated with hormone therapy. In 2005, I had to go on chemotherapy and have been on several types since then. The hormone therapy lasted from 1995 to 2005, so it gave me 10 good years. Each time a therapy failed (I got a reoccurance), I was put on another type. My side effects were not bad, and I was able to function for many years, normally. Once all the known hormone therapies failed (6 occurances), the only choice left was to stay on chemo. So, now I have been through countless types of chemo. The treatments work for a while, but then the cancer figures out a way around it, and I move to another type of chemo. I have cancer nodules growing in my omentum (stomach lining), right and left lungs, kidney and liver. I go to yoga about 3 times a week, still swim every day, play golf, and try to function as normally as possible. I get fatigued pretty quickly, so I take a lot of rests. I had to stop working and focus totally on trying to keep myself physically active so I can stay strong. Don't know if this helps....but just wanted you to know that the treatments they are giving your mother in law can work.....btw, I also had the cancer in my ovaries and fallopian tubes and I had them removed back in 2003. I started with a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation in 1995. Had two ocuurances in my breast with local surgery, but in 2005, ended up having a right mastectomy.",
