    "Content": "Hi ladies, Firstly, I think you are all really brave. This is my first post so apologies if I don't say all this right.  I am not feeling brave at the moment.  My mum has just had a mastectomy and we are waiting for the results from the lymph node tests.  She is 62.  It's all happened very quickly and not sure any of us have come to terms with it yet. My triplets are 4 years and adore their gran and love playing with her as she is so active.  My little girl is really bright and the boys are a mixture of wild and sensitive (depending on what mood they are in) but I have to help them understand what's going on without overdoing it. Is there any advice / suggestions you could give me? Kirsty x  ",
