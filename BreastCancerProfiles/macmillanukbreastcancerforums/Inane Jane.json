      "Content": "Hi Sorry to bother you souls out there but I am looking for advice... I love swimming and playing in the water, I have been told as my one breast is a Double D none of the prosthetics will work very well in the water, they will slip and fall out of place , get to heavy etc... Basically I've been left feeling that to continue with my love of water that I should consider a reconstruction otherwise I won't be able to indulge my playful passion of water...  Anyone have any thoughts ? Thank you...",
