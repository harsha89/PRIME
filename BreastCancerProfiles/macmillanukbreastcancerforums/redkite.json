    "Content": "Hi. I had a Tug reconstruction 10 weeks ago. It's early days but I'm very pleased with the result. The thigh scar is higher than I expected and will be covered by pants/swimming costume and the bit across my bottom will be in the crease so no problems in bikinis!  Having worn a softie and had an implant for the previous 18 months it's great to feel free of both and much more comfortable.  The operation was long and recovery ongoing but in my view worth it in the long run at the tender age of 45!  Happy to share more information with you if useful. Best  of luck.",
