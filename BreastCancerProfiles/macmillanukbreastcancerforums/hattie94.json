      "Content": "So I'm not sure I'm even qualified to be posting here because I've not been diagnosed. Basically, I was at a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon for a breast reduction surgery when he found a lump in my right breast. It's really deep - I don't think I would have ever found it if he hadn't. After reassurance from him and my GP that an ultrasound would show it to be a cyst or fibrous tissue, I didn't think about it until at my ultrasound appointment they told me it was neither of those things and I needed a biopsy. This wasn't something I expected to happen and it really sent me into a bit of shock. They didn't do it then, although they wanted to, because I was crying and panicky. Although I knew biopsy was a worst-case scenario of the ultrasound appointment I really didn't expect them to spring it upon me then and there. I had read dozens of accounts from women who said that their core biopsy was the most painful experience - more painful than childbirth, some said!  Now I have an appointment for next week and aside from the normal anxiety I have - feeling like I'm carrying around a 35mm bomb in my chest - I am petrified of having this biopsy done and I feel like I need to talk to people who have had positive experiences who might be able to offer some advice. This is all happening in my final month of uni and while I feel like I don't have a right to complain because I've not had any kind of official diagnosis, it's actually very stressful.",

      "Content": "Once more thank you all for such reassuring responses. So I had the biopsy this morning and although my person wasn't allowed in with me while I had the procedure and I was crying a little bit because that made me a bit panicky, it was actually completely and entirely painless.  I didn't even feel what was going on around in there while they were poking around like you do with dental treatment. Local wasn't even bad at all - I've had more pain plucking my eyebrows. The whole thing was completely fine I'm so embarrassed that I was so terrified. Now it's just playing the waiting game.. although my wonderful radiologist said that they looked exactly like fibroadenoma samples so fingers crossed that's all they are! ",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for being so supportive. I think my research turned up a bit of a skewed set of results - you're more likely to write about a traumatic experience than a positive one - and I am so glad that all of you had good experiences. I'm sure it's normal for them to suggest a biopsy straight away, but I think because I had been told repeatedly that my lump was nothing, I felt a bit ambushed by the suggestion.  I do have my best friend's mum taking me to the appointment. She had a core biopsy done herself a while ago, but her breasts are much smaller than mine (I'm a 30J - hence the reduction) and her lump was closer to the surface, so her experience didn't resonate with me so much. As for the mass itself, it's 35mm (which seems quite big to me), hard, deep and supposedly smooth, but asymmetrical. It kind of feels like a slightly ropey-textured marble really deep in my breast. I think I saw the word fibroadenoma in my doctor's notes, but no one mentioned this to me and my GP told me that the fibroadenoma is called the breast mouse because it's so moveable. Mine isn't very moveable at all, but then again I'm not an expert and I really can't tell what I'm looking for.  Again, thank you - I can't tell you how reassured I feel by these responses. I wish you all the absolute best and I will be letting you know how I get on throughout the process. Even if it turns out to be a problem, at least there's something I can control through treatment and proactivity! ",

You're all wonderful human beings and I wish you the absolute best in life - you all helped so much. I'm sorry I was such a wreck over something much less daunting than what most of you have faced. ",

      "Content": "Again, thank you all so much for your responses. The kindness and consideration is not just helpful, but heartwarming. Today I managed to speak to my university tutors and make arrangements so that the stress doesn't interfere with my final few deadlines - although I'm going to try and not delay it too much because I would really like to graduate this summer! I also spoke with my doctor yesterday about my apprehensions regarding the biopsy. He has prescribed me some diazepam to help me through it, and to help with any stress during that 13-day waiting period too. I don't really know when to take them as my appointment is 8:45am and I won't have been awake very long at that point (instructions were to take one upon waking and one an hour before the procedure) but I'm sure I'll figure it out. I also met with my breast reduction surgeon who thinks that if the lump is benign it's something that can be removed with no extra difficulty during my reduction surgery. It's kind of neutral news - but I'll take it!  Still pretty nervous for the biopsy, but all your kind words have been a great help in assuaging my fears. I could't be more grateful for this support and I wish you all the absolute best.",
