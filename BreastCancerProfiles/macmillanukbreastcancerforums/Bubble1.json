    "Content": "Hi I had mastectomy and immediate reconstruction on 23rd Jan.  This was my first surgery too (I\u2019m 42) and I was absolutely petrified. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t wake up or the surgery wouldn\u2019t work. It was all fine. I don\u2019t remember going to sleep as I think they gave me something to relax first.  It will all be fine, this is something they do everyday. Good luck xx",
