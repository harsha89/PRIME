      "Content": "Hi Just wanted to see general consensus on my predicament. I had my operation to remove Paget's (central excision lumpectomy) on 20th December.  Prior to the there was no sign of any DCIS on any mammograms or ultrasound. Pathology report on removed tissue finally through and just been told yesterday that they found 2.5cm high grade DCIS within the tissue removed.  So I have been given the option now of going back in for a mastectomy or just monitor with yearly mammograms.  Well considering this one never showed up on the mammogram or ultrasound, I don't think I can risk relying on mammograms to find anymore DCIS.  So most likely will go back for the mastectomy to avoid any worrying. Overnight am now thinking I should just be done with it and have a double mastectomy, as if I have any DCIS in other breast they also may not show themselves and then may not show until it gets to the invasive stage - I know not all DCIS turns invasive, but considering I had high grade unseen on mammograms then I cannot trust yearly mammograms. If I had not had Paget's then the DCIS would have remain unseen for another year and possibly turned invasive by the time it shows on a mammogram.  Or am I overthinking this?  Surgeon had said the DCIS and Paget's was unrelated. Surgeon doesn't seem to think double is necessary, as low percentage of people get BC in 2nd breast, but then a low percentage of people with BC have Paget's so I cant cling to that one. Apparently yearly MRIs are dangerous as recent medical info shows the dye collects in the brain, I did say are you sure that is not just a cost decision and they said definitely not.   So to be free of worry I feel I should just get rid of both.  I am not a breast person, so that does not really bother me. Any thoughts / insights / advice welcome, many thanks. Eliza",

      "Content": "Hi Tiy Well done on the good news.  Can't answer your question about reconstruction I am afraid, but wanted to ask you a question please. What was order of your testing you mentioned learning about everything being non invasive, what tests did you have?    I ask because mine was as follows (as posted earlier today),  - would be grateful if you could read it and let me know what you think. to my question about MRI at the end........... thanks. I have just been diagnosed with Paget's ......  biopsy was positive (after negative mammogram and ultrasound).  Surgeon has said only a central excision is required - and they will check other tissue they take at the time of the op.  After getting home and researching, I am wondering why they don't do an MRI now, so that they will have more of a definitive on whether there is any underlying cancer, as mammogram and ultrasounds do not show everything apparently, MRIs go on to pick up anomalies in 25% of negative mammograms .  Surely this gives them a better picture of what is going on, and will confirm if only a central excision is enough, saves them finding more after the op and having to operate again. Ouch!  I have a list of questions for surgeon tomorrow, I am sure there is a reasonable answer.  But school of thought on medical blogs on internet seems to be after a positive biopsy that if mammogram and ultrasound are negative then do an MRI to get whole picture of anything underlying before deciding on treatment. This is all a bit of a fright.  Booked in for op in 3 weeks. Thanks for listening, any light that can be shed on the above, gratefully received. Thanks Eliza",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda Just checking in with you to see how it all went, hope you have recovered / are recovering well. I had my op for Pagets (central excision) on 20th. Just been told yesterday that they found 2.5cm DCIS high grade within the tissue removed, hadn't shown up on the mammagram or ultrasound prior to the op.  So I have been given the option now of going back in for a mastectomy or just yearly mammograms.  Well considering it never showed up on the mammogram, I don't think I can risk that!  So most likely will go back for the full mastectomy, I knew they should have just got rid of the whole thing in the first place! Overnight am now thinking I should just be done with it and have a double mastectomy, as if I have any DCIS in other breast they also may not show themselves until it gets to the invasive stage - I know not all DCIS turns invasive, but considering I had high grade unseen on mammograms then I cannot trust yearly mammograms. If I had not had Paget's the DCIS would not have been seen on a mammogram, so dread to think that by December when next mammogram is how far along it might have gone. I will likely repost this as a general question as to what others think if in my situation, single or double? Surgeon doesn't seem to think double is necessary, but then he also didn't think I had anything in the first place! Apparently yearly MRIs are dangerous as recent medical info shows the dye collects in the brain, I did say are you sure that is not just a cost decision and they said definitely not.   So to have a worry free rest of my life I feel I should just get rid of both.  Not a breast person, so that does not really bother me. Hope you are all good and would be interested to see what you think. Many thanks Eliza",

      "Content": "Hi Yes it seems nothing is straightforward, poor you, sorry to hear your news. Certainly my first reaction when he said the options were either for mastectomy or yealy mammograms, I thought \"well cant be that serious if he thinks yearly mammograms are OK\".  But when questioning him on why they couldn't see my DCIS, he just said some DCIS does not calcify in some people, so not seen in mammograms, so that made me think well I cant risk it if mine are unseen, it cold wreak all sorts of havoc over next year if I have others already in another area of breast going unseen.  When questioned if DCIS could turn invasive in 11 months they were not able to give me any assurances that it could not - so logical solution would be mastectomy to avoid that.    Questions mounting for next visit! Take care Eliza ",

      "Content": "Hi Does anyone know if B.E.S.T is an option in any country? Seems to be much more comprehensive imaging, but can only find info when the Doctors were presenting it to boards etc., not sure if it has been taken up yet. I ask because I had high grade DCIS that wasn't found on mmg or us, only when they did a lumpectomy for Paget's disease. So I am trying to find a testing that may relieve worries that there is anything else lurking there, rather than just the options the surgeon gave me of a preventative mastectomy OR just walk away and have yearly mmg. Also does anyone know anything first hand about Oncotype test / a genetic test to see how likely a cancer is to occur / re-occur or something like that. Thanks Eliza",

      "Content": "Thank you, yes I heard from another forum that the Doctor was discredited and a fraud.  Good grief! Yes there is an Oncotype test for DCIS, which I am trying to get my insurance to cover if the surgeon thinks it worth it.  I won't get it done until I make a decision prior that if results were in the \"unlikely to re-occur\" bracket that it would help my decision, otherwise it is a waste of everyone's time!  However it is unlikely to relieve my mind that there isn't any other high grade DCIS lurking anywhere that the lumpectomy / mammogram/ ultrasound didn't cover.  Not helped by having a friend who had ended up getting BC in both breasts 5 years apart and if she knew what she knows now would have had a double in the first place.  Rare I know, but doesn't help! Having clear mammograms is no peace of mind to me, as mine was clear when they found the DCIS. If it was low or medium it would be a different story I think. Thanks for your input and glad you have yours all behind you. Best regards Eliza",
