I have ordered some too.   I have my results from my node clearance biopsy tomorrow and I'm expecting to find out when chemo will start.   I'm a little nervous but I will start on the manuka ASAP and try to bolster my immunity as much as possible before it starts.",

      "Content": "..Hi Hannah,When I first noticed the changes in my Breast, I expected it to be a non cancerous cyst of some sort as there is a history of this in the family. My sister,  my mother and 2 maternal aunts all have had lumps removed.I mentioned to my mum that I wasn't concerned as there is no history of cancer,  when she dropped the bomb that her cousin had had cancer. She is still alive and kicking now,  decades later, but it was still a shock to hear.  Due to me being diagnosed at a young age, my 2 sisters have to undergo checks just in case. I am going against hope that I am the odd one out,  but I think I'd rather they were regularly checked and any changes were caught early, add they were with me. My lump,  when removed was only 12mm and had already got into the sentinel lymph node, so I'm pleased I saw the changes when I did and got straight into the doctors. I hope everything goes ok with you and wish you lots of luck xx Nicola",

      "Content": "Hi Mandy,  I don't think you're being irrational at all. It is understandable, having got used to a structure, to be apprehensive about it changing.  I was due to have my first chemo tomorrow and is been delayed due to a stupid cold, of all things! I want looking forward to the chemo but nor doi like this uncertainty. I also felt adrift in the time between my results appointment in the breast care unit after surgery, and my first oncology appointment was very difficult to bear.  It wasn't particularity longer than other waits,  but there was no definite timescale, and that left me feeling edgy.  Yes,  there will be times when you will be ecstatic that you have overcome this very aggressive treatment, but there will also be the down days, and don't feel bad for them. Sending lots of hugs for you,  and I'm glad you have your German Shepherd to take care of you in the wee hours too xxx Nicola",

      "Content": "Hi Jessie, it is all a confusing whirlwind, I agree.  I too, felt very swept away by it all.  In my case, the consultant was also pretty certain it was cancer even before the biopsy results. After I had the biopsies taken, it was 8 days until I got the results.  I received a letter just a few short days after the initial consultation with the appointment.  The probability of surgery and radiotherapy was mentioned immediately and I was given a date for surgery when I was given the biopsy results.  I had all of my appointments at the breast clinic up until my post op biopsy results came back all clear, at which pointi was told I wouldn't need to go back to the breast clinic for 12 months,  but that I would receive an appointment for oncology within 2 weeks.   That wait felt endless and I did feel a little abandoned, but now I'm back in the fast lane again.  Just take heart that is all moving so fast as they are removing that nasty cancer as Quickly as possible.  I think they don't want to overwhelm us with info as theres an infinite amount of possibilities and until you go back to the consultant for results, they don't know for certain which path you will take.  Just know that everybody here is there for you, everybody is at different stages and has a different tale to tell so the help is there whenever you need it.  Need a rant?we're here fit that too  xxx",
