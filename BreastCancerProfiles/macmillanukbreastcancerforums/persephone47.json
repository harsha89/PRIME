      "Content": "I am dozy knew i would leave something out lol, i am on letrozole, i have found that ok, trying to lose weight with a view to lowering the risk further, which is proving challenging but it is coming off, the Letrozole i feel is not helping with the weight, but i am determined to get the best possible chance. I feel quite lucky, i do have the odd wobble, but who doesn't. I will say with the letrozole, the chemist changed my brand and i had a bad reaction to it so my doctor now specifies the brand i want which is accord, it would appear different brands affect different people so you may need to try different ones to see which suits you, i have read this for tamoxifen too although have no experience to offer. I take mine with breakfast as i found i sleep better, rather than take it at night, again whatever suits. I will keep my fingers crossed for you, i hope you get a low score, but if not you will get through it, anything you want to ask, ask away i dont mind. You take care Linda xx",
