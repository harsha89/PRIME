    "Content": "Hi Lynn That too tight ponytail feeling then itching is what I had before some of my hair came out.I had the cold cap throughout my whole treatment and only really lost the day before my second chemo. I have a small bold strip that I cover with a headband. I bit of advice ( this is only what I think ) try not to disconnect the cold cap to have a wee!! It then has to re freeze again. I crossed my legs after the first one and did not really lose anymore hair x not sure if this is related and it was difficult with the fec part. Good luck and don't be disheartened if you lose some the cold cap can work x xÂ ",
