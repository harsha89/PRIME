      "Content": "Hi Sammywam The pain I have is on the other side of my ribcage not the same side as the surgery. I have a small lump there and I will have it scanned on 25 October. My imagination is very fertile at the best of times so you can imagine I have created all sorts of scenarios about it! It is reassuring to know that other people do have similar pains etc and makes me feel better about it all. I`ll let you know how I get on and thanks for the response.",

Yes I do want to start swimming but the 2 wounds are not completely healed over and so I will wait to make sure no bugs get in! Thanks for replying it is reassuring to hear from others like me.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am new to the group and wondered whether anyone has ever experienced what I am going through. I have stage one invasive ductal cell carcinoma. I had a lumpectomy on 13 September this year and thankfully the sentinel node biopsy results were good. I have found a small lump under my right ribcage and my GP is sending me for a scan but does not think it is anything to worry about. My query is that I have more or less constant pain in my upper body front and back, left and right. I am tying to reassure myself that perhaps due to the surgery I am not lying properly in bed and this is why I have the pain. I am a bit of a worrier and hope someone can offer some reassurance. Thanks",

I started a 5 year course of Tamoxifen 2 weeks ago and will start my radiotherapy on 15 November. Does anyone know if it is ok for me to use the ultrasound please?",

      "Content": "Hi, I can totally sympathise. Just after my lumpectomy in September I had a pain in my left side and found a small lump, and yes the brain went into overdrive. Fortunately my GP arranged an ultrasound and it was just a fatty lump and can you believe it once I was told that the pain `mysteriously` went! Everyone is giving you (and me incidently) very sound advice, all we have to do now is listen, not so easy I know but do keep trying. I am starting a mindfulness course next week arranged by a local cancer charity so I hope I can change how I react to these thoughts and not let them control me. Thinking of you, stay positive and keeping busy is really helpful (if you feel well enough of course). Take care",
