      "Content": "I suffered from excruciating all over body pain especially my back 6 days after my first docetaxol. My temperature was up that night and the hotline told me to go to a&he. They did lots of tests and everything was fine they just told me to keep taking painkillers. I'd ring the hotline to make sure, that's what it's there for. Hope you feel better soon x",

      "Content": "Hi, I've mainly had joint aches and pains from days 4-9 which I've taken painkillers for. That's been my worst side effect. Other than that I've had hot sweats most nights for about a week after and just general fatigue.Â  Hope that helps. Good luck with your docetaxol xx",
