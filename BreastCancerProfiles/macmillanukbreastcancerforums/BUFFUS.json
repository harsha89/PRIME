      "Content": "hi anne.sorry it seems so long to reply but i replied to your email didnt know you couldnt do that but never mind.i have DCIS i think that was why i was so shocked as in my head i thought once the lumpectomy had been done i would be then facing radio therapy as my surgeon said breast removal was worse case senario and wasnt expected,once they got the results back from lab they had took 7cms and they hadnt reached a clear margin so there was no other alternative i go in wed to have a vein cut in my groin i think,, so as the blood flow will increase in the artery in my belly as they are using my belly for recon, thats why i have to wait untill may for mascetomy .at the moment they think it will be about 3mths before they can reduce the other one as i have big boobs.when you had your mamogram was your other boob ok? i really dont want to start getting paranoid but i asked as they were reducing my other boob would it be better to remove it and have recon incase i get it in that one,but my nurse says its healthy at moment ,all the infomation does confuse and when you go over and over  in your head it becomes a complete muddle.  lol buffus xx ",
