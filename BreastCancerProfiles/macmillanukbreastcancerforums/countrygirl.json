    "Content": "I too had a similar decision to make my results we 88% survival over 10 years with an extra 3% with Chemo, I too have lost several people family members over the last years to varying form of cancer that had spread to become secondary's.Â  it is a difficult decision to make and when I posted earlier on the forum I was reminded that it is only you can that can make it with the support of your family. I have just had my second course of FEC yesterday and though not pleasant it is doable, I have managed to do things with my family on good days and even been to work for the last week, but remember everyone is different. We as a family decided it was better to get in a fight at 49 rather than 59 and then I can move forward knowing that I have done everything possible to get rid, What ever decision you make be assured you will find plenty of support here from lots of lovely people and your family and friends. All the best xx",
