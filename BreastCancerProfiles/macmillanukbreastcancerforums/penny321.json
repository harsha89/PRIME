When I said to doctor do you think I have cancer, he said its suspicious for cancer, why didnt he tell me straight out, cos they didnt do a needle aspiration but a core biopsy.Im at my wits end here with worry.x",

      "Content": "Went to my doctor today as i was in a bit of a state. She said the worst case senario is that I have cancer, however when she examined me she could not feel a lump a few weeks ago, so she says it would be very early cancer and easily treatable which is good, she said if it was definately cancer and it had spread they would have detected the spread on mammo and ultrasound. So I will just have to wait till thursday, she also said that they probably did core biopsy and not needle aspiration as it is very small x",

He said when I asked suspicious for cancer, but no percentage was talked about, he also said its very small and thought to be very early. Noting could be felt when he examined me, I also went complaining of nipple discharge [both sides] and problem with left side , so I was gobsmacked when told they had found something worrying in right breast. So maybe hes just suspicious and doesnt really no one way or another. Dont no what to think. xxx",
