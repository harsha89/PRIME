      "Content": "Hi,  Just wondered what experiences some of you may have had with the cold cap and hair loss.  I've had 2 x FEC to date and due another one on Wednesday. I used the Paxman cold cap each time and found it really uncomfortable as it has to be so tight on your head and it's a long time that you need to wear it. Second time around I was a bit more prepared, both mentally and practically, and found it just about more bearable.  However, approx 2 weeks after second session, my hair really star to thin out and every time I touched my head, I had loads in my hand.  So, I had it cut to about 1/2- 1 inch which I found really difficult  as prior to starting chemo on the 18th November I had long, thick hair but had it cut to bob length the day before the first session.   I couldn't face a \"shave off \" and thought that what was left would fall out anyway. However, I don't think I have really lost anymore since so apart from a few \"gaps\", I still have some hair, albeit that it is much thinner than before.  So now I'm starting to wonder if it's as bad as it gets and that maybe I should persevere with the cold cap after all.  Or, I'm thinking that the 3rd FEC next week will make the rest fall out even if I use the cold cap.  Maybe I'm just being overly optimistic that what's left on my head will stay put if I use the cold cap again but what I don't know is if it's highly likely that if I hadn't used it, I would have lost all of my hair by now. Any thoughts form anyone would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Iona,  Your hair loss sound very similar to what I had been experiencing with FEC.  Lots of thinning and some gaps on the top where like you, I suspect t the cold cap wasn't touching my scalp.  It is hard for the nurses though I expect to tell exactly how well the cap is sitting on your head. So, when I went for my blood test for my 3rd FEC treatment which I had yesterday, I spoke to the sister about whether it was worth carrying on with the cold cap.  I also asked her if I would have lost all of my hair up until that point if I hadn't used the cold cap from the start. She said I would have lost it all so to some extent the cap had worked.  However, she also said that with the gaps I had, it could make is quite uncomfortable as my scalp would be exposed to the cold.  In many ways, it helped me to make the decision to just have it cut shorter and just accept that it needs to be done and that, as everyone keeps telling me, it is only a temporary thing although I'm not entirely sure it's a real comfort if I'm honest.  I managed to get the lovely girl who has been colouring and cutting my hair for a number of years to have a look at my hair Tuesday afternoon.  She said she would need to put the clippers over it to even it out a bit and started with a number 3.  She then said she could do a number 2 on it but to me, it seemed fine.  She said she could do a two and a half so that's what we agreed on!! I'm not saying it is easy but I just think what I had left was not really saving.  From January, I'm going to have 9 weekly Taxol sessions so if all goes to plan, from April, some hair might start growing back.  In the meantime, I've got myself a variety of head ware and have had no reservations about going out and about. Of course whether you decide to continue with the cold cap Iona is entirely your decision, I'm just saying that for me, it's now one less thing to stress about and my session time was greatly reduced.  I just now have to wait for the inevitable with my hair and deal with it. Good luck with whatever you decide. X",

      "Content": "Hi, It is really distressing when it starts to fall out and it seems never ending. Interesting too that yours started after one session of FEC where as I was unaffected until the second lot.  It goes to prove again how we all seem to have different responses to the treatment we are given, even if it's the same drug. Having had my hair cut shorter, it has definitely not been as stressful once I got over looking at myself in the mirror.  I have been wearing bandanas and scarves and didn't feel initially I would be able to go out anywhere unless I was wearing the wig I had aready got.  However, after a day or so, I honestly felt okay about going out in the scarves etc and nobody to my knowledge has even stared or said anything.  That's not to say I'm not still upset about my hair because I am but everyone keeps telling me it's only a temporary thing which I hope of course will be true.   So, hard as it is, try not to stress too much about your hair coming out as like I said in my earlier post, after the initially shedding of hair, mine seems to have stopped.  I'm going to chat with the oncology nurses on Tuesday when I have my blood test and then make a decision about whether to continue with the cold cap for Wednesday's treatment. Good luck and let me know how it goes. X",
