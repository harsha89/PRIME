      "Content": "Hi, I\u2019m 7 weeks post reconstruction but with the muscle from my back but I think the experience is similar. I was really scared to but it wasn\u2019t as bad as I expected. I was in hospital for a week and by the time I went home was walking around fine, just not lifting anything. When you wake up it is painful but they try and keep you pain free as much as possible, morphine is great !!. I found the care amazing so try not to worry and you will be in the pub within a couple of weeks, just depends on how you feel. I went out for a curry 10 days post op !! Take care xx    ",

      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I'm very new to this site having only joined last week but have been reading all the emails and thought it was time to tell my story. I have come out the other side having been diagnosed in January. I had a left mastectomy as I had found 2 lumps which at the time I assumed would be benign so imagine the shock to be told not only was it cancer but I was to lose a breast. That thought really hadn't occured to me. While all this was going on I was also going through the collapse of my marriage so have really relied on friends to get me through this and they have been wonderful. Also my 9 year old daughter has kept me sane when I really could have lost the plot. Following the surgery I had chemotherapy, 6 cycles of FEC which left me very naseous and tired for the 1st week then weeks 2 and 3 I usually managed to go to work if only to feel normal and get out of the house. Having got through the chemo I then had 5 weeks of radiotherapy which I finished in September. I am slowly getting getting my strength back and gopefully in time life will seem better but at the moment it is really hard as trying to stay positive for my daughter but I really miss having that special someone to make everythg ok. I just really wanted to make the point that it is a really hard journey but we do get through it and really appreciate your friends and family, they will be your best support and make sure you talk about how you feel, nobody minds. I have had couselling through Maggies and it has really helped. Not to mention a bottle of wine and a friends shoulder to cry on !! I'm hoping to get reconstruction in the new year so hopefully a new year, new me and who knows what the future might hold. Take care all of you out there, we aren't alone xx",
