      "Content": "This waiting about for my appointment is got me full of anxiousness. Constantly wondering when it will come in the post. I had one letter confirming that the doctor has sent information to the clinic. I'm constantly checking my breast for anymore changes. An it's only been 6 days since I went to the doctors. I feel really bad as I see loads of people struggling with what they are going through and I'v not even been to the clinic yet. I keep telling myself that I will be ok and really hope I am. I think everyone on here are so brave!",

So I'm not sure what to expect, would I get any results on the same day? Or would I have to wait? As I was thinking of going on my own, or should I take my partner? Thanks for getting back",

So iv went to worst case sanario in my head. I keep reminding myself of hope instead of I wish.. Something my dad always told me to do. His words of wisdom thats stuck with me. Sorry for rambling . thank you, I feel a bit more relaxed now Â :)",
