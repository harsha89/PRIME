      "Content": "Has anyone had lipomodellinh to improve a breast implany. I had mastectomy and a gel implant 12 months ago, my implant is smaller than my other breast and a different shape so surgeon suggested lipomodelling. 1. Is it worth it.      2. Is it very painfull and for how long.     3. Do you really have to wear tight spanx for 2 months.  4. One hospital says wear a bra, my hospital said do not wear a bra for 6 weeks. ?? Any information would be appreciated. Deciding should i have it done or just carry on with small pad in bra.",

Have had a few side effects, heartburn and wind was quite bad but the dictor has now given me tablets very tired and hot flushes the day after chemo, bt unmanageable. I have another 3 sessions 3 weeks apart. Hair will start to fall out about 3rd week i am told. I have bought 2 wigs and some scarfs. Did not want to sit at hospital for hours so did not go for cold cap as it does not always work.",
