      "Content": "Hi Ive had an ultrascan a few months ago because i found a lump in my breast. The ultrascan revealed a swollen lymphnode. It was painful then and is now. I've been to the gp again because it is still swollen and hurts but the doctors cannot seem to tell me why it hurts or is swollen. Ofcourse it is always at the back of my mind and i am constantly wondeting if is it normal or is there more to it? I was wondering if anyone had a similiar experience. Thankyou",
