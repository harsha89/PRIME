      "Content": "Hi to both ladies who replied to my message,  you're very kind. I am going to get in touch with BCN to get checked out. Breast remains very swollen and hard and just feels constantly uncomfortable, so not sure what's going on. I think I'm scared of becoming a moaning Minnie as there seems to be a new ache or pain every week,  hoping it's just old age!! !! Has anyone else had problems with nipple remaining inverted since their Op? Never had this prior to surgery.   Again,  I think I'm just wanting to know what's normal!! ! Keep well,  Marianne. ",

      "Content": "Hi tried a few different avenues for advice but struggling to get help, one year after Op for stage 2 bc and lymph nodes, pain in breast is unbearable and wondered if anyone else has same problem, just want to know if this is normal. Turned 53 yesterday and spent day in bed, not usually a quitter but it's getting me down, any advice would be wonderful, thanks for reading this",
