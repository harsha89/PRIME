If I don't feel like cooking, it's frozen microwave meals! Lay on a store in the freezer. Or something easy like a pie that can just be bought, put in the oven, and removed when done. The chemo guys gave me a bottle of hand sanitiser to keep in my handbag, and I just use that every time I go out and touch anything like a railing or a cash machine. Other than that, I'm staying in as much as possible. After my first FEC, I craved all sorts of odd things, so I had my husband buy them all in readiness for FEC 2, which was awesome. I went nuts for Waitrose organic sausages - the skinny \"chipolata\" ones with 12 in a pack. I made him buy 3 packs and cook all 36 at once, so I could snack on them whenever I wanted over those first few days. Broccoli, haloumi cheese, kiwi fruit, and baby potatoes smothered in butter and parsley were some other cravings! I think you just have to keep telling yourself that it's okay if you don't feel like doing anything. Don't feel guilty!",

(I have big ears to make the look even better!). I started chemo last week and cut my hair as short as I could first, while still being long enough to tie back. I went with the cold cap, which felt pretty crappy, but obviously not TOO bad as I got through it. I think it was a Paxman because I remember at some point making a joke about Jeremy Paxman on University Challenge. I have to say, even though I'm going to continue with the cold cap, after just one treatment my priorities have changed. I felt really sick that first night and I've been so tired ever since, that now I'm all, \"Who cares about my hair, I just want to feel well again!\" Also the faint silver lining is that it's winter, so wigs won't be as hot or uncomfortable (hopefully), and we can even wear hats over our thinning hair and have it look passable. But I do know how you feel - my hair grows incredibly slowly too, so it'll take years to get back to \"normal\". I guess you just have to do what you can to fight off the evil cancer! It sucks. *hugs*",

I've always been prone to pimples around my chin and mouth area, and when I was disagnosed (I'm 35) I had to stop taking my contraceptive pill, which made my skin go a bit haywire over the following weeks. Right after the chemo, it suddenly cleared up, and I was thrilled at an actual good side effect! I thought the chemo must have dried it all out or done something good to the hormones. But that didn't last more than 3 days, and now I'm just a mass of pimples, so many so that it actually hurts a little when I move my mouth! Is this a common side effect, and is there anything I can take or put on them to help them along their way? I don't think I even had them this bad when I was in high school! I've always found with my skin that washing as seldom as possible with a light Dove soap is the best thing, but clearly this regimen is no match for chemo drugs! Any ideas? Thanksxx",

I went for chemo because it could shrink the lump, and then the surgery should hopefully be less invasive? Like you, they say the breast should be fine and I won't need a full mastectomy. But I have to see what happens with the lymph nodes - the surgeon said we would try to save them, and the oncologist said they'd have to come out! So I don't know. I really wish I could have just had surgery to take out the cancer, and not had to go through chemo for ages, but whatever works best to save my life, I guess! *hugs*",
