      "Content": "Hi I havent been around on here for few weeks, been completely floored.  But had to comment on this.   I had lumpectomy and full clearance of underarm lymph nodes and was sent home with drain in.  Tube became disconnected a day later but i was told to reconnect although the vacuum would no longer work.  72 hours later the drain was finally removed. Thr next day my breast began to swell and i ended up with awful infection.  went to hosp to be drained 4 times, each time around a pint of fluid. it wasnt a painful process but non the less i should have been admited at given antibiotics through drip which after 3 weeks i was. this only happened because sat at home having sunday lunch, the centre of one of the op scars breached and began oozing pus. i went to a&e and i basically sat and poured well over a pint out of the hole. I was admitted and given drip antibiotics for 3 days then operation to reopen both scars and flush out all the remaining infection. This all delayed starting chemotherapy and caused immense stress. Please (if u havent already) get intouch with your breast care team and insist they deal with the infection asap and dont be fobbed off being given oral antibiotics which just arent strong enough. I wish you well, hope you get it sorted soon Andrea x",

Last week went to docs as breast was redder and hotter than usual and thought i may have infection. i was referred to hospital and theyve found a series of cancers in same breast. im devasted and terrified. the hell ive gone thru for last year was all for nothing, the hosp didnt remove it all in first op and now i have to start all over again.  im having mastectomy next tuesday then will begin chemo again. not only have i lost a year of my life, the cancer has been left in my body for a whole year longer to do more damage and spread around i am 38 with 2 young children who have been through hell for past yr and ive just had to tell them its all starting again. my partner works at sea 3 month at a time so im on my own with them and i have no support off any family or friends",

I have two young children and the thought i may die and leave them absolutely terrifies me.",

I know what your going through, all the waiting and uncertainty is so scary. Im terrified to find out results of the bone scan but at same time really want to know so i can finally know what im dealing with.  Im desperate to start chemotherapy which has been delayed because the breast and underarm became really infected following operation and ive had to have another operation to reopen it all and flush infection out as well as havinbg iv antibiotics.  Now waiting for infection to clear before treatment can start. I really hope everything goes ok for you, please let me know how your doing. keep strong, Andrea",

But on the whole not so bad and today i feel much perkier.  I tried the Paxman cold cap but arent expecting too much so going to get a wig organised too just in case.  i have really long curly hair and if it does start coming out too fast im going to bite the bullet and shave it off.  Dont think i could wear a scarf, i dont want people looking at me knowing i have cancer. Ive noticed a few ladies mention milk being a problem.  is this due to chemo or an ongoing allergy. i drink alot of milk and was wondering if that was what gave me the dioreha. Good to hear bluetit has done ok on her first chemo too.  bring on round 2 and we'll be a third of the way through it!! take care all, Andrea xxx",

I have appointment tomorrow with chemo team so hope to find out which type im having then and get more information.  Its the unknown that frightens me. When i was diagnosed i was told lump was 15mm and nothing in lymph nodes so outlook was very good.  But when i had lumpectomy they found lump was 55mm and they did full clearance of lymph nodes as 11 out of 14 removed where infected.  Chemo nurse told me i was to expect to be blasted with the worst they could give me but as yet i have no idea what that is. Thanks again for sharing your story with me.  i wish you all the very best and would love you to keep in touch and let me know how your getting on. Andrea xx",

I just keep reminding myself it has too be done and with each one im ridding myself of cancer. its surreal to not actually feel ill or have any 'symptoms' but am about to start a treatment which will make me ill.  Im sure on Tuesday it will suddenly all be very real.  But Im doing my best to keep positive and take each day as it comes.
