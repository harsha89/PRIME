My treatment has been moved forward because they were able to fit me in at Christie's, so I'm starting on this coming Tuesday :-S  Getting a bit nervous now. Did you take the paracetamol and ibuprofen before putting the cap on? or is that to have afterwards? Thanks very much for getting back to me.",

Or for anyone else that's reading this? I'm starting chemo on 1st Nov (two weeks time) and am going to give the cold cap a go.  I'm just a bit worried of going through all the pain and extra effort and it not working.  Did it work ok for you? Did all your hair stay or did it fall out in clumps? Or did it all fall out anyway? It'd be great to hear from you.",

I've decided to go for the mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, going for the Latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction because they can use my original breast skin for the op.  I'll have to go back later on to get a nipple put in and tattood but it should look normal(ish) straight away.
