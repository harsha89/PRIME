      "Content": "Hi Maystan Thanks for all the advice.  I phoned the hospital today to tell them my symptons and they asked me to go in and get my bloods checked and be seen by the doctor.  All is well.  The doctor said the pains I am experiencing is a side effect of the Granocyte.  She explained that because the Granocyte speeds up the stem cell production in the bone marrow, thats why I have the pains in my back and sternum because most of the bone marrow is produced in both these places.  She said the Taxotere also has the aching joints and muscles as a side effect.  She said to continue taking the ibuprofen and as I already had some Tramadol (reading your early post reminded me) take that as and when needed but it can cause bad constipation.  So I am back home in bed and taken some ibuprofen.   I have Gelcair to use before I eat as my mouth is so sore.  I'm ok with the tastes of foods at the moment its just anything like bread, chicken that has no liquid/moisture in it I struggle to chew.  As we tend to chew at the sides of my mouth, thats where my ulcers are its very painful.  So I'm going to try foods I can just swallow that are soft.  Even eating melon this afternoon was a task and I had to give up. All the best to you, Nauticalannie",

      "Content": "Hello All, I must be very lucky!  I don't know where you all live, but I live in Essex and go to Queens Hospital in Romford for my treatment.  I cannot fault the team there.  My GP made the error of not getting a lump checked out under my right arm back in May 2010.  Once I finally got refered to the breast consultant in Feb 2011, I was booked in for a Mammogram, Ultrasound scan and  cell biopsy on 5th Feb.  I went on holiday to the USA on the 12th & the day before they said they were booking me in for a core biopsy on Feb 22nd. I then saw my breast consultant on 3rd March who explained the cells from the core biopsy in the lymph nodes were positive with oestrogen receptors but no lumps found in the breast.  He saw me again on the 8th to get me to sign papers for surgery to have the lymph nodes removed.  Because no lumps had been found in the breast he wanted me to have an MRI scan (done on 11th March) a Bone scan (done on 15th March) and a CT scan (done also on 15th March).  I then had my pre-op asessment done on 17th March and the op on 21st March.  There was then a lul as all the tesst came back negative, which was good but they wanted to make sure they were going to treat me for the right cancer and needed to find the primary cause.  So next was a trip to Barts on 28th April for a PET scan (it would have been sooner but we had Easter).  I saw my consultant for the results on 3rd May and another negative.  So now it was an appointment with Oncology for chemo & radiation treatment on 11th May but one more test to do first to make sure it had to be breast cancer. So on 20th May a Colonoscopy & Gastroscopy was done. A pre assesment was done on 25th May and chemo started.  A Echocardiogram was done on 31st May.  Since then I see my Oncologyst on the Friday before my next chemo on the Wed where we discuss any problems & side effects I have.  I have a number to phone in hours & out of hours if I have any problems.  Today I phoned for advice and they asked me to come in and be checked by the doctor & have bloods done as I was suffering with bad back & chest pains and sore mouth.throat and other symptons.  The team are always very good and understanding.  My oncologyst sent me for another Mammogram and ultrasound on my boob which I had this week, as she wanted to make sure no lump had now occured before I start radiotherapy.  She is also organising another MRI scan.  I have had 3 lots of FEC, 1 lot of TAX with 2 more to go, then 5 weeks of radiotherapy.  So I wish you all good luck and suggest you move to Essex!!",

      "Content": "Hi All I have just had my first Tax 7 days ago and your rashes sound awful, I hope I don't get them.  What I have experienced is really bad pains in my back generating from my spine to each side. I've been taking ibuprofen for this and it helps but each day it is getting worse.  I also have to inject myself with Granocyte for my immune system.  I'm wondering if this doesn't agree with the TAX? I had the injections with the FEC but never felt like this.  This morning I was in agony with really bad spasms. I've had like red hot poker stabbing pains too around my inner ear and in my right breast.  My mouth is also very sore now with ulcers and food is like eating cardboard. Have any of you experienced any of these symptons on TAX and how did you deal with them? Good luck to you all x",

I do feel very lucky that I have a light at the end of my tunnel but I do know of people that don't. ",

      "Content": "Hi Peter Rabbit I have just heard my 3rd chemo last Wed, canular in back of hand for 1 & 2 but 3rd one was at the base of the thumb start of wrist.  My arm was very tender before but now some days it is actually painful.  Having read all the previous comments, I don't know what this PICC line is or Portacath.  I've had 3 FEC's & my 4/5/6 will be TAX which I understand is drip fed as opposed to injection fed. Can you tell me or does  any one else know if your arm recovers from this once chemo finishes?  Also to explain the PICC & Portacath. Many thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Sally, I had 3 lots of FEC and now starting 1 of 3 lots of Tax.. I was going to have the cold cap but couldn't face having that on my head, I dont do cold.  I was also told that I would lose my hair regardless once I had the Tax so I didnt see the point, I thought I would have enough to cope with and I could do with a new set of hair!  Mine started falling out and then I had whispy bits left that wouldn't go, I looked a bit like stepto or Homo Simpson!!  It was ok when I had my wig on but some of the wispy bits showed belowed my base ball cap.  so I got brave and finally shaved it all off.  I was a bit scared to do it, the wig provider told me it was better to have all new hair grow at the same time and length.  I've been told and read that with the 3 lots of Tax I will lose all my body hair, so I wasn't sure whether to shave it or hang fire for the Tax to let the rest fall out.  I just got fed up being half and half and I was practically bald apart from these wispy bits that were like 2 inches long. Let me know what you decide to do and hope this has been of some help? Have you only got to have 1 lot of Tax? Annie x",

      "Content": "Hi Kim I just read your post and I too have started Taxotere.  I also have to do Granocyte injections for my immune system from post chemo day 4 for 5 days.  I had a little ache at the base of my neck and upper back and shoulders but when I started the injections I had severe back, breast bone & Pelvis aching with two episodes where it was like having contractions in my torso.  I eventually phoned my oncology departement for advice on what to take for it.  They told me to come in and get bloods done and checked out.  Turned out the aching joints are a side effect of the Tax and the severed pain and spasms was a side effect of the Granocyte.  Once the injections stopped this all eased although I have felt much tireder and weaker on the Tax, I have had 3 FEC.  I have just had my 2nd TAX so am geared up to what to expect this time.  My understanding is a lot of these symptons do all get better with time but you can still experience side effects for up to a year after chemo finishes.  I think it is all a small price to pay to be cancer free and live out our lives to a ripe old age.  I know its hard when we are going through all of this and to be made to feel unwell when I actually felt in good health when diagnosed.  You will have the up and down day, I have, just have a good cry and you will feel better.  Focuse on the light at the end of the tunnel.  I was about to embark on a whole new life and to sail off round the world when I was diagnosed.  I have just changed my plans slightly but am still going off at the end of my treatment to live on my boat in Gibraltar with trips back to the UK for my check ups. I wish you luck and we will all get there in the end Ann ",
