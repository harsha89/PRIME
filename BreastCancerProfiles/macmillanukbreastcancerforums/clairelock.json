      "Content": "I had my second session of chemo last Friday and so far apart from the first 3 days after I am feeling fine. I am having EC chemo. Grade 3 however they believe grade 1. Chemo first, op, then radiotherapy. I am 35 working fulltime and have a 3 year old son. I have been with my company for over 10 years so that does help with my treatment. I have just ordered myself a wig as my hair is well and truly gone!  I know I have a year long battle to beat this at the end of my 3rd chemo I am getting the tumour measured with the hope it is getting smaller.  So far chemo is doable for me as I have to try anything in order to see my 3 year old grow up. If you feel it's right for you then go for it. X",

      "Content": "Your consultant will refer you for these types of testing. My tests were carried at St Georges, London as strong history of cancer in my family. As I was diagnosed at the age of 34 with triple negative, this is normally linked to the BRCA gene. For me I didn't carry this gene and the conclusion is just simply down to bad luck! I would research the cancer research website as this no only holds a wealth of information but is up to date.  www.cancerresearchuk.org/.../inherited-cancer-genes-and-increased-cancer-risk",
