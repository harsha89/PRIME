    "Content": "I agree with all the other replies.  I am 2 years post surgery but would still not even have my blood pressure taken on the surgery side.  I had my FEC through a cannula inserted in a vein in my hand.  Is this what you mean or did you have yours actually in your arm?  If so, then maybe the veins in your hand could be used instead.  I didn't have any problems with that.  Good luck with the treatment.  I have every faith in the FEC group (including EC) of chemo drugs.",
