      "Content": "Hi I am also experiencing similar symptoms and pain .I also teach and struggled with emotions and well being. Ask to see your HR/Occupational Health and tell them exactly how you are feeling. Ask for them to recommend you return on a 'phased return', eg 50% working for 2 weeks, review, then 75% for two weeks then review, then move to full time. I am currently going through this process and the first two weeks were extremely exhausting so I continued for another two weeks on 50%. I am now on my final week of 75% and getting there slowly.

      "Content": "I am new to the group and need a 'hug'. I am currently being treated for Breast cancer and had surgery on one breast and 'planned' for delayed surgery on the other believing this would happen relatively soon after finishing radiotherapy. I met with the surgeon and was told it would be at least a year before this could happen and would need to have my first mammogram before the surgery can go ahead. This has really sent me into a down ward spiral. If I had fully understand this was going to take such a long time before I can try and get back on track, I would of had a double mastectomy with reconstruction . Can anyone please give me some advice on how I can cope with this long delay or how I can move forward. Thanks tm680",
