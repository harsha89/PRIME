    "Content": "Hi Gillian am trying to contact you as your situation sounds similar to mine but I have been recommended chemo by oncs due to size of lump (4.3cm) although surgeon said he thought I didnt need it. I see yours was 5cm and you didnt have it. Have tried to send you friend request but not sure if I'm using this site correctly, hope we can find a way to discuss, I have been given all the stats and a couple of weeks to decide. Sue",
