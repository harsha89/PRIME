      "Content": "Thanks for getting back to me Gay. So pleased that you only have mild SEs. I live in hope! Maybe 3 months is still early days. I intend to watch what I eat and drink, max the water and build up the walking now that the better weather is here. I\u2019m hoping it will help. Best wishes to all, Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Winky, I\u2019m new to this site. It\u2019s a coincidence that I\u2019ve been on Letrozole since Jan too and have pain in my right shoulder! I was thinking it was due to the surgery (2 lumpectomies and lymph node removal on right side) but maybe it\u2019s the medication.Â  The general aches and pains seem worse on some days than others. Tonight my toe joints ache! It feels like I imagine arthritis to be. I have been wondering if it could be due to my diet. Certainly alcohol doesn\u2019t make me feel great and I do wonder about inflammatory foods such as wheat and red meat. I\u2019m wondering if the lady who posted no side effects might be vegetarian? It would be really good to hear from others with no side effects to see if there could be a link. Anyway, I\u2019m going to keep a food diary-I\u2019ll let you know how I get on. Best wishes to all xx",
