    "Content": "afternoon ladies.. i'm new to this group having been diagnosed with grade 1 stage 2 invasive ductal breast cancer (2.5cm tumour) on 7 june and had a mastectomy on monday of this week.. i've been reading through all of your messages and the support you are giving each other is amazing.. For me its all happened so fast so i havent really had a good cry about it - i carried on working up to last friday as it was a good distraction and my work colleagues were so lovely, then straight into hospital on monday for surgery and home by tuesday teatime - i was really lucky that my chest drain was only in until thursday and i've already been up and about but finding i get tired quite quickly. The one thing that scares me is still to come - i get my lymph node results on 2 August which will tell whether i need chemo - i'm really positiveÂ at the moment but i think this will turn things on its head.. SarahSS123 if it helps i felt more in control when i knew the facts, also taking a paper and pen with me then i could reflect at home and process everything, my mum came with me to my appts which also helped - but the waiting is always the worst bit - hoping everything ok for you.
