      "Content": "hello all I have been for my ultrasound and biopsy today, the staff were so lovely! they couldnt pick anything up on the scan but decided to do a biopsy as definate thickening in the left breast and have to go back in two weeks for results. They seemed to think there wasnt anything for concern, do they ever play things down as I've spent the last two weeks feeling extremly anxious and now feel very flat not knowing how I should feel? Came out feeling very positive then started to think I should be lulling myself into a false sense of security 'just in case' Has anyone had a similar experience? Thanks Linds Â ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. I am at work just in a state of panic, certain the pain is worse and that this is a bad sign, can't help but go over worse case scenarios and a driving myself mad! feel very alone right now as anyone I speak to just keeps telling me its nothing to worry about which is easier said than done! I know that breast pain isnt an early symptom but this just worries me more that it is cancer and more advanced. I just wish I could could quiet my mind, I'm not sleeping, awake in the early hours just worrying myself, not sure I can cope with the wait of not knowing :( I'm so sorry to keep on but just dont know who to turn to.

      "Content": "Hello I'm new to all this, I have had a benign breast lump for a number of years and experienced pain periodically with it, however on Christmas Day I noticed a change in my left breast, not quite a lump but something not normal! Went to GP today for check up expecting to be told 'don't worry it's nothing to worry about' instead she said it was a thickening of breast tissue and she was 50/50 and would refer me to the breast clinic. I have spent the day in a daze trying to process this! I suffer with severe anxiety already and death has always been my biggest fear, especially the big C! Hospital called me tonight to offer an appointment for next Friday morning, I am so scared and convinced that I have it, have not stopped crying! I'm a single mother of a 14yr old boy who has his own health problems and not sure I am strong enough to cope! I have read some of your entries and wonder what keeps you all so strong and able to cope?! I am already going into worse case scenario that this is something I've missed for a long time, and my last bout of anxiety with severe nausea and panic attacks are linked and that it means it will be cancer and have spread! So sorry for the ramblings, just don't know who to turn to. Lindsey",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your replies! I am trying my best to keep myself occupied and have been allowing myself to have tearful moments that I had been trying to avoid before! I just wasn't to get to Friday and have the tests out of the way! Even if it's not what I want to hear at least if I know I can then deal with it and make plans! You are all so inspirational I just hope that I can have a fraction of the strength that you all on here have! Unfortunately I have such a strong mind that I am imagining all sorts of physical feelings that have been scaring me, linds xx",

      "Content": "Hi all I have an appointment at the breast clinic on Friday, have already posted before and found the replies really helpful! Am swinging between optimism and absolute doom and gloom! This next week is going to be the longest ever! However I also feel guilt, if it's turns out to be nothing I will feel like a drama queen for going on about my situation! My main problem is that I have had benign lump previously but this time it feels different! Not sure if that's cause it is, I'm older or my anxiety disorder kicking in! The weird thing is I have spent the last 6 months having daily panic attacks which have been awful and then I find this thickening and the attacks have vanished?! Maybe cause I now have something real to focus on! Anyway my concern is that previously the benign lump was a definate little round lump which have me pain around my periods, this time it's an area of lumpiness and I have a lot of pain throughout the month, again not sure if the pain is real or imagined! Going out of my mind here! I have amazing family and friends but they all think I'm just worrying when I shouldn't! I do have extreme health anxiety, so every twinge or pain I feel in my body tells me that it is the big C and has spread! And there's not much hope! I lost a close friend to brain cancer last April which really shook me up and has made cancer so much more real to me! And I guess this scares me even more now! I am a single mother of a 14 yr old going through his GCSE's, guess I am more scared about leaving him alone than anything else! Sorry again for my ramblings! I know many of you are going through the kill and don't need me blathering on like this ðŸ˜ž Linds xx",
