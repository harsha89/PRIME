I live a 6 hour round trip from the hospital I've had surgery, chemo and rads at, not easy but my choice. The chemo trips were shattering as I'm sure you can imagine and for RadioT I had no option but stay over in a hotel Monday to Friday.......as an upbeat kind a girl I tried to make the most of the situation but according to a close family member who should know better........ \"that was a holiday\".........gggggrrrrrrrr.......",

      "Content": "Hi Ruby, I've been undecided whether I should respond to your post or not as my diagnostic experience started very much as your own, for me it turned out I had cancer......DCIS with micro invasions. However what I wanted to say was my calcification clusters had been monitored for 6 years before they changed and became \"suspicious\", so as others have said just because you have calcification clusters doesn't mean you have cancer. That said I think it's good in an odd way that you are at least considering the fact the news might not be what you want to hear. I say that because I was so blas√© about the whole mammo re-call, biopsy etc. as this was my 3rd re-call, I just hadn't considered the possibility this might not be just another false alarm, so when I got the news it came totally out of the blue and I just wasn't prepared for the news. Others have already said prepare some questions for when you do meet with your doctor, hopefully you won't need them but best to be prepared as your brain will be scrambled if you do get the news you don't want to hear and do take someone with you as you probably won't take everything in, so a friend or relative by your side can really help. Unfortunately waiting for results during this journey is the worst part, I found that as long as I kept busy I was fine, it's the quiet times when fear and worry can sneak up on you, just remember worrying won't change the outcome, so try not to waste your energy and effort on doing so....I know easier said than done but really there's no upside to lingering on negative thoughts. I really hope your results are clear, in the meantime if you want to know anything more about my journey please feel free to PM me. Take care and good luck Amanda",

Whilst I'm sure many of us have done a similar thing, our thoughts and views aren't put into print etc. and then inappropriately shoved down someone else's throat as an example of how \"doable\" BC is. I don't blame VD for that (although as a responsible journalist she should have given more thought to the impact of her work) more our media obsessed culture and in my case a mother with very strange choices in motivating technics!!!

      "Content": "Hi All, I did yoga before my diagnose in Jan 2015, I managed to keep some aspects of it going through treatment and returned to it \"properly\" about 10 weeks ago. It's been a fantastic help for me both physically and in re adjusting some tamoxifen driven negativity in my moods and attitudes.¬† I've been very fortunate in having a teacher who knew me before and after surgery/treatment and runs small classes, so has the time to go through things with you individually.¬† Given this experience I just wanted to pass on a couple of cautions to ladies/gents considering starting or returning to yoga. 1st ¬†- make sure you find a qualified, reputable teacher, who has had experience in dealing with ladies/gents who have had breast surgery, hopefully any who are recommended by your BCN or Macmillan will meet those criteria. If your new to yoga make sure you start with a beginners class or arrange some 121 sessions before starting a \"class\".¬† 2nd - make sure your teacher knows your limitations, depending on your surgery you may have been advised not to do certain things e.g. carry weights, although you don't use weights in yoga, you do use your upper body to hold your own weight to one degree or another in certain poses e.g. Downward Dog! A good teacher will be able to adapt poses to fit your limitations.¬† 3rd - go slowly, don't push yourself too much and certainly don't be competitive, your body is recovering from more than just surgery and you hold all your emotional tension and stress in your hips, groins and solar plexus, so it's not just standing on your head that's seriously dangerous if you don't know what your doing. When starting Yoga it's like the swan on the lake, calm on the surface and frantic activity below (thinking about it is always like that :-)) so even the simple poses need to be done properly to avoid injury and reap the real benefits.¬† All that said enjoy it and try to do some practice everyday, even if just 10-15 minutes. After 10 weeks I'm pretty much back to my previous range of movements and my attitude and approach to life is more positive, plus you get to meet some lovely ladies and gents. Namaste¬† CC",

The tricky thing about showering for me was actually the drains, you'll probably start with 2 but drop down to 1 after a day or two. I had mine for 10 days but think that's unusually long, think 4-6 days is more NormaL¬† I'm not a bath lover so not too sure about that as I just haven't bothered having one.

My hubby also ordered some Intensive skin care cream and wound gel with the UMF 16+ MH and their both fantastic....the skin cream is great on dry skin areas, I had a cut on my finger which I was worried about healing, 3 days using the wound gel and it's pretty much healed. For anyone suffering with an upset tummy, mine seems to be settling after three days eating the honey either off a spoon or as they recommend on bread, as it stays in the stomach for longer! they also suggest you take the honey about an hour before main meals and before you go to bed, it maybe pure coincidence but my tummy finally seems happier.

I know this might go against some of the advice we might have had but my oncologist said letting the air circulate around nails, particularly your toe nails helps keep any fungus from developing, also I've been using almond oil most days on both toe and finger nails to keep them strong and a good quality moisturising cream to keep the cuticles moisturised as well as keeping the nails short. I also get hubby to give my feet a massage when the tingling hits, it helps increase the blood circulation to area. I had pretty good nails before I started and have to say so far they're holding up, that said onco also said the effect on nails is very personal, for some it hits from day 1 and others not until after all the chemo is completed so I'm not counting my chickens just yet.¬† as for Mr T....now 2nd dose + day 6 and feeling OK, aches have lingered longer than after the 1st dose but except for day +3 nothing that isn't doable, for me Mr T has been more doable than FEC, SO FAR!! Hevbo, totally agree.....not keen on the word \"normal\" my Mum has a mantra she uses around me Positive, strong and normal......don't mind the positive and strong but after 3 weeks I'd had enough of the \"normal\"........after all everyone else can carry on pretty close to normal but don't see that as an option for us ladies and I suspect our old normal has left the building for good, to be replaced by a new and maybe in someways a better normal going forward....well that's what I tell myself :-)) Maybe it's the phase of the moon but my hubby also had a wet shoulder this morning...... Enjoy the rest of the day ladies Hugs Amanda",

I know there can be quite big variances between hospitals as to how long after Chemo your radiotherapy starts. I've been told I'll have my radio consultation between my 7 & 8th chemo sessions and start chemo 3-4 weeks after my last chemo, which means if things go to plan I'll start the first week in August. Whilst I think others don't get there consultation until several weeks after their last chemo and then wait 2-5 weeks for their radiotherapy to start. And then of course like your Mum, some will need to have and recover from surgery after their chemo but before radiotherapy, so tricky timing wise. Anyone else have a rough idea when their chemo might be?¬† If you ladies think it would be helpful and if I'm first up, then I'm happy to start something after my radiotherapy consultation sometime in late June early July. amanda",

Have read on other blogs that Ladycare Magnets can help with the hot flushes etc. I did try one early in my chemo days but found it made things worse for me.

Among the foods he recommended were guava, pomegranate and broccoli, he particularly recommends something called Pomi-T which is a capsual with extracts of pomegranate, broccoli, turmeric and green tee, I've seen a report on this previously but it was directly linked to prostrate cancer so not sure how relevant to breast cancer it might be, I'll need to research a bit more. He's also given up standard caffeine.¬† Whilst I'm always interested in what people think can make a difference in improving our chances of cancer not reappearing, it wasn't so much what he recommended, after all we all have our own views on that but the sheer fact he could be bothered to take time out on what is basically his holidays to come round and share this information that impressed us.

      "Content": "Hi Hevbo......been thinking about Nadjie's advice about exercise, exercise, exercise......which I totally agree with. If you go down the LD Route can I suggest you ask the hospital about their arrangements for post op Physio (if they have any) In my case I had daily Physio for the first 10 days followed by twice weekly physio's for 4 weeks, then weekly Physio for the last 10 weeks (I couldn't manage more than once a week once on Chemo). As you've had chemo your recovery might be shorter. This isn't all for movement following the lumpectomy, more the range of movement and strength in your LD muscle following the surgery, particularly around lengthening the part of the muscle moved into your boob so you can twist, turn and lift your arm in comfort.¬† In an ideal world I'd have seen the Physio before the surgery so we could establish what was \"normal\" movement before the op. It turned out in my case I already had a shoulder impairment which I knew nothing about before BC, so the Physio has had to work out what restrictions I already had and what's down to the surgery and then work out a recovery plan for both!!¬† I'm almost 4 month post op. and on a day to day basis would say I've had full movement for at least 6 weeks, although the strength of the LD muscle operated on is still less, as a sporty person my expectations of what I can do is probably greater than \"normal\", I'm hoping my strength will improve once my treatments finished and I can put more effort into building it up again. If your hospital doesn't offer a Physio programme I would recommend you look into what you can arrange for yourself. Amanda",

Two suggestions that might help, try giving your scalp a massage, I used bio oil but any light oil should be OK like baby oil, don't put too much on, just enough to lubricate the massage, this should encourage the last of your hair to leave the building and generally stimulate and ease any soreness. If that doesn't help my Onco suggested putting cold wet towels on the scalp to ease any itching or soreness.¬† And don't stress too much about losing your hair, most of the ladies on here will probably tell you it really isn't that bad once it's gone and you'll be amazed how quickly you get used to the new look.

      "Content": "Hi Karin, actually Mr T hasn't been too bad so far. I know the steroids are a pain but they are really helpful in reducing any initial side effects. The first main difference you might notice is the length of time it takes to administer the drug, mine took 4-4.5 hours, about 2 hours longer than FEC although I was also given an antihistamine and some extra steroids due to a delay in my treatment, you might not get either of these but expect Mr T to take longer. I had some tingling in my toes about an hour after the chemo session finished which lasted about 40 minutes, I was told this was normal although how long it lasts for varies from person to person.¬† I felt fine for the first couple of days but then days +3 to 5 I had some muscle aches, all body tingling and headaches but from day 6 onwards things improved and for the last few days I've felt really good, certainly better than my last couple of FECs. I'm due my 2nd T on Tuesday, so let's hope Tuesday is good to both of us and the week in general kind to all the chemo bunnies. Amanda",

Well 2nd T + 1 and all pretty much as last time, steriods flush and energy levels although did managed to sleep OK despite the pesky steriods. Karin I'm amazed at the difference in the drug administration time, I have a chemo port in my chest which works pretty much like a PICC line but it's all inside your chest so no awkward bits hanging out ...after the first week when it just felt odd and sore after the op to insert it, I've not had a minutes problem. For those of you having problems with your PICC lines it might be worth asking if your hospital does them, Nadjie has one as well and think she gets on OK with hers to. Again it took about 4 hours 20 to give me the cocktail of drugs with most of that time, 3.5 hours for the Paclitaxel. Bunglesabout...I found out yesterday that I'm actually having Paclitaxel, which is part of the Taxol regime but apparently should have \"easier\" side effects. In another post George described Paclitaxel as \"being hit with a velvet glove rather than a wet leather one\" this might explain some of the differences in our experiences but I don't want to get ahead of myself as I've only got 1 of these under my belt so far.....I need to wait until Tomorrow before I'll know how soft or not the side effects are this time round! But your spot on about the meds. I was told right from the get go to get on top of any aches, pains, nausea etc. it's much easier to stop the pain etc. developing than to ease the pains once they've got a hold. Good luck to chemo bunnies having their next sessions today and later in the week, hope it's kind to you. Hugs Amanda",

      "Content": "Hi bm84.......like Nadjie I opted not to use the cold cap, one piece of advice I'd add to Nadjie's post is if you decide not to use the cold cap get your hair cut really short e.g shaved just before or soon after your first chemo.....having your hair really short will help reduce any tingling discomfort leading up to you losing your hair but also the actual loss will be easier, e.g. it doesn't come out in handfuls when your in the shower and short hair doesn't make quite as much mess :-) It's also easier to give your head a massage to encourage the hair to come out once it starts to fall and will makes the process quicker. Sorry if this sounds a little depressing but best to be prepared if you go down this route and on a brighter note....it really isn't as bigger deal as you might think, I lost my hair 7/8 weeks ago but became used to my new image very quickly. Like Nadjie I've got hats, scarfs, cotton beanies etc. but decided against a wig and to be honest I now spend most of my time \"commando\" as it's cooler and actually people who see me take it they're stride. Anyway the choice is yours..... Hope everything goes well.....good luck and just shout if you have any questions amanda",

I had a similar conversation with my surgeon about the potential for chemo and was all of a spin.......didn't want it but wanted to do everything I could to beat the C cells. in the end the Oncologists made the decision I should have chemo.......whilst I'm still not sure I want it, having someone else make the decision for me helped. Jackie on this site was a great help to me in coming to terms with having the chemo basically she pointed out that if they told you advance that chemo would give you even a small % improvement/chance of beating cancer/extending your life....wouldn't you take it? Ask yourself how you feel about it.....we're all different so listen to yourself. i should have had my first chemo yesterday but running a temperature so postponed.......had all my tests and my port installed so ready to go for it once I've cooled down.

Sorry can't help on the Filgrastim injections as didn't have them but certainly worth having a chat with your Onco as I'm sure they'll have a view on this, problem is you might solve one issue only for another to be caused by not having the injections, so best to speak to the professionals. like you say it might be necessary to have an extra weeks rest, I know you want to get to the end ASAP but if an extra week means your stronger and fitter for the chemo then maybe you'll get some restbite from the infections. Docetaxel is tough but your tougher and your almost half way though, just take one session at a time, when session 4 is done you'll be 2/3rd through with just 2 more to go.........well done you.

We were in an art galary area in Lisbon during the first day of the test match but kept an eye on the scores....we kept saying 5 for how many, 7 for how many....all out for what????....must have been a great day of cricket to be there for :-) Amanda",

      "Content": "Hi Susie, first off nausea is probably the most common side effect with FEC so don't worry too much...it's totally normal. As to how long it will last......that tends to vary from person to person but I'd say on average it tends to ease around day 4/5, for some sooner. Be sure to tell your medical team how things went as they maybe able to give you stronger meds to take next time. I had a tough time with the nausea first time round and they gave me Emend for the following cycles which really helped. Personally I didn't get on with Domperidone, it tended to make me feel worse!!¬† Try eating small and often through the day this should be easier on the tummy than bigger meals.¬† Hope you feel better soon Amanda",

      "Content": "Hi Angie, dealing with hair loss is a personal thing but based on my experience I'd say shave sooner, rather than later. Like you I hated the shedding, In fact clearing up the hair was more of issue for me than the actual loss of hair. Whatever you do DON'T wet shave, you don't want an open wound now your on chemo, use an electric hair trimmer which has been well cleaned before you use it. Once shaved I found giving my head a good massage a couple of times a day helped speed up the process, I used Bio oil but you could use anything similar. I think it took about 5 days to go from the scabby badger look to bald. I also had a couple of cotton beanies I wore in bed to that any shedding didn't end up in my mouth :-) In my experience this is the worst part of the hair loss, once it's gone it's amazing how quickly you get used to it and please try not to think of yourself as a cancer patient....more a warrioress doing battle with the enemy :-)) Take care Amanda",

      "Content": "Hi Michelle, firstly how lovely to hear from you but so sorry you\u2019re have such a difficult experience.¬† I was fortunate to be referred to a specialist clinic by my insurance company, it\u2019s called the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon hence my online name It\u2019s a private clinic and as I was covered by insurance I\u2019m not exactly sure what the costs were but would estimate around 4-6,000 euros, although this included 4 or 5 nights in hospital. They normally predicted a 3 night stay but the amount of liquid from my senoma wasn\u2019t slowing down sufficiently, hence the extra nights.¬† I had my removal and reconstruction in one procedures which took about 4/5 hours. Couple of things to highlight, apparently the procedure is easier on slimmer small breasted ladies of which I am one, if your a larger lady, the procedure is still fine but either they combine the LD flap with a implant or maybe do a reduction op on your other breast...obviously one to discuss with the surgeons.¬† The other is the clinic specialises in LD reconstructions, subsequently they have developed a procedure which only requires one point of entry for the surgery (under the arm pit) from which they do all the necessary surgical work, there is no scar on the back which is where most ladies get their complications or future limitations from.¬† As I\u2019m relatively small breasted, at the time 32B, they didn\u2019t need to take much of my back muscle. Yes there is a little tightness but most of this is down to fibrouses of the scar and on a day to day basis I don\u2019t feel anything and it certainly doesn\u2019t stop me from doing anything, for instance I\u2019m a 12 handicap golfer and do yoga 4 or 5 times a week.¬† 3 years after the op. the breast has shrunk a little, it doesn\u2019t bother me so I\u2019m not doing anything about it, although the surgeons have offered to do a small simple procedure to balance my boobs but as long as they are health I\u2019m happy ¬† My Breast surgeon was Dr Pedro Gouveia and my reconstruction surgeon was Dr Joao Anacleto, they both speak perfect English, in fact Dr Joao (first name only in Portugal, very informal) worked at the main Glasgow hospital and was part of the team that worked on the boy David from Peru if you remember him? ¬† Sorry I\u2019ve gone a bit, if I can be of any further help please don't hesitate to contact me again, I'm happy to exchange email addresses via private messaging if that would be helpful.¬† wishing you all the very best¬† Amanda",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I had an LD reconstruction in Feb 2015. My op took 2.5 hours but I am slender and the surgeon did say it was an easier op for slimmer ladies. I was in hospital for 5 days and had drains for 10 days.¬† I had my surgery in Portugal in a clinic that specialises in this op so I only have a scar under my armpit, nothing on my back which I believe isn't the norm.¬† I had chemo and radiotherapy post surgery so difficult to say how long the recovery from the actual op was but a year on I have full movement and can do everything I could do pre op and I'm pretty sporty so regaining full movement was important for me. I had physio from the day after surgery and this continued 1 or 2 a week for about 3 mths.¬† Aesthetically the reconstruction is fantastic and unless you knew I'd had surgery I think it would be almost impossible to tell the difference between my boobs. My experience has been positive but I know others have had a more difficult time, so do some research and ask your surgeon lots of questions about the op particularly how often they do it as it is bigger surgery involving cutting and rejoining nerves in and around the muscle. I still have some numbness but nothing that effects my day to day activities. Feel free to send me a friends request if you want any more information¬† Best wishes Amanda",

      "Content": "Hi Loulou, not really in the same boat as yourself or other ladies as I'm ER + so have the added \"benefit\" of Tamoxifen etc. However your situation rang many familiar bells for me as my initial diagnosis excluded chemo, just rads. So when the post op biopsy came back and changed the prognosis to a boarderline recommendation for chemo I went into overdrive looking at the stats etc. and feeling very undecided as to which way to go. Like Julia say's only you can make this dec'n, what swung it for me was knowing I'd have to live with the dec'n I made, with that in mind I opted for chemo as I didn't think I'd be able to forgive myself if I hadn't taken every possible step to prevent re-occurrence. Obviously it's no guarantee but this way I feel I can live with my choice rather than constantly wondering what if? Amanda",
