    "Content": "Hi -- thanks in advance for your help. I am a BRCA2 carrier considering risk-reducing a bilateral mastectomy. I'm 28, and am not looking to have reconstrucion at the same time -- I'm thinking a more incremental approach will work for me. My question is this -- what are people's experiences with longer-term pain from a 'simple' mastectomy? My Dr. said about 1 in 10 have longer term pain issues that require management, but everyone I meet (and seemingly a lot of people on this forum) have longer term pain issues. Are there any folks out there that feel pretty pain free and 'back to normal'? Or any advice about this consideration -- anything you wich you'd known about long term recovery prospects before a mastectomy? Many thanks for your help!",
