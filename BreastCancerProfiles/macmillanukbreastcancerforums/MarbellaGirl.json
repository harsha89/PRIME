      "Content": "Hi there, it\u2019s 5 weeks today since my left MX and temporary expander.  I was in hospital (nearly drive me insane) for 10 days (in Portugal) as they won\u2019t let you go home with drains here.  I was terrified in advance as had never been in hospital ever before, struggled a lot with pain management, didn\u2019t respond to morphine, or most of the other drugs offered (Tramadol etc), so now on diazepam which does help, as the pain/severe discomfort after each weekly inflation is mainly spasm related.  I read with interest someone\u2019s comments about its people who are normally in control or very independent who struggle the hardest (or I think it was words to that effect?).  I have a stressful job with long hours (not that I am back at work yet), and the hardest thing I have found is the length of the recovery period and managing the pain. I am so lucky - although I had a lot of DCIS, (hence having to have full MX - 585gm removed, who knew smallish boobs could be that heavy!) my path results were clear as was the lymph node test, so no further treatment required so one lucky girl here.  But the torture of going through the weekly expansion (I have a very thin muscle wall there, which doesn\u2019t help apparently) and the thought of further surgery in a few more months to replace it with the permanent implant, well can\u2019t even think about that bit yet.  I just don\u2019t understand why 5 weeks later, I am still shuffling round like an old lady, I need to lie down after a coffee with a friend, for about 4 hours, when surely I should be ready to be doing cartwheels??:-).  I read people\u2019s stories with interest where they are out of hospital after 3 days, all be it with drains.  With the pain I was in, despite getting myself up and showered and shuffling round the hospital 2 or 3 times a day, there is NO WAY I could have been out in less time but than I was, and after the removal of the 2nd drain, well let\u2019s not go there.......after about 10 mins, I seriously felt like I had been stabbed several times and the Tramadol was utterly useless, even an hour after taking, thought I was going to have to have to re-admit myself!!  I thought I was going to go through this experience in a pain free haze of lovely drugs (as I had read for so many), and whilst I have great surgeons, fantastic nurses, and obviously the best results I could hope for, I think I might have lived without the temporary reconstruction had I fully understood my own body\u2019s difficulty in getting over and through this.  I am such a strong positive person, and I am surrounded with a loving partner, and beautiful friends near and far, but I am just so frustrated at the slowness of my recovery when I read on here how fast everyone else seems to get better (ignoring other required treatments of course).  Sorry don\u2019t mean to sound sorry for myself, I really do know how lucky I am, just so so frustrated with the time!!!! I eat healthily, I do the exercises I was told to, I rest, so why do i still feel like a 95 year old with s broken rib in the mornings until I take the bloody tablet?  I need to go back to work in a week (subject to dr approval), have at least 2 more inflation\u2019s to go (aagghh) and at the moment it takes me about 90 min\u2019s to get myself ready in the mornings:-).  Anyway I am going to shut up now, as I am actually bored of moaning, it\u2019s so out of character, but I would like to know if it\u2019s only me that it takes this bloody long a recovery for, and anyone else who has had this experience with pain management after the surgery, and following each expander experience??  Thank you ladies, you are all so amazing and I read your stories and take such heart  from them, not to feel alone in this place none of us want to be in...... x",

      "Content": "Hi all, just had a single mastectomy and reconstruction with an expander two weeks ago in Portugal, where I live. I was petrified about the surgery having never been in hospital ever before, but expected to spend the next days in a cloud of pain free haze. Unfortunately I spent 3 hours in agony in the recovery room wide awake as the morphine wasn't working. Then the next few days I was in varying stages of pain as they tried different cocktails of drugs (Tramadol - didn't work very well but better than nothing, Nolotil (banned in U.K. and usa) gave me migraine and nausea, Some other anti inflammatory stuff that wasnt really for pain relief anyway. 1000mg of paracetamol that didn't really touch the sides but I guess does take the edge off now I am out of hospital. The doctors say it's very unusual that someone would not respond to morphine (who knew such people existed??), and for someone to respond so poorly to other strong painkillers, that I have very sensitive nerve endings and tissue. When the second drain came out after 9 days (they don't let you go home here until both drains are out) after about 15 mins I thought I was being stabbed and taking Tramadol again did absolutely nothing to ease it. I had my first expansion this week and was in severe discomfort, to say the least, for 36 hrs after it, so not looking forward to the next 4 I need. So my question is can anyone recommend good natural painkillers for now, and at some point I will have to have more surgery to replace the expander with the prosthetic - what other strong pain killers are there which I could ask for as an alternative?? Thanks in advance!!",

      "Content": "Hi Ella70, firstly Happy Birthday!!  Everyone\u2019s experience about how to do this is so different I think.  I live in Portugal where I told my friends face to face.  I figured the more positive vibes and support the better.  I have many friends in the Middle East, where I worked for 6 years, who are all close friends with each other, and another group in the U.K., again who all know each other.  So I made two \u2018what\u2019s app\u2019 groups and put together a message saying I had had bad results from a biopsy and was having surgery on X day, that I was very lucky as they were very optimistic that no treatment would be required after the surgery.  However I never use and still don\u2019t!) the BC words as I thought that might be too direct (and probably a bit of denial on my part!).  It was the best thing I could have done, those two groups have messaged me pretty much daily since my op 7 weeks ago, and I do not know how I would have got through it as well without their support and encouragement.  My friends in Portugal I have known for 6 months to a year and they have been great, but it\u2019s a very small group and it\u2019s just not the same feeling as you get from lifelong friends.  I didn\u2019t put anything blatent on FB, but enough that\u2019s it\u2019s obvious I have been in hospital for something serious.  Anyone who was a good friend who I hadn\u2019t already told privately messaged me, or I did to them.  Hope that helps?  Michèle",
