      "Content": "Hello, I am new here so I hope i am doing this right. In october I was told I had breast cancer, lumpectomy first, but when they looked they found out it was bigger than expected, so I had a mastectomy in november, I went to the oncologist last week and found out a few things I didn't know about, I am triple negative, I had no lymphs involment, and no vascular what ever either, it is a bit chinese to me, but anyway she said I better not have chemotherapy because of a heart condition, she didn't seem too worried about it, as she said I was all clear, but then I have been listening to people, reading in the net and I am scared, I think ignorance is a blessing the problem is once you start the knowladge game you want to know more, especially if it is your life that is involved. Is there anybody out there the same as me, I feel everybody else is in this big boat called chemo or something else after surgery and I am there on my own in a little boat, I am not bother about chemo if that is going to creates more problem than it is worth I just don't want to be alone, sometimes it feels I have been put in death parole. Hope somebody can help by friendship and understanding.",

      "Content": "Hi susan, I am also triple negative, had mastectomy 20th november, but can't have chemo or anything else because of other health issues, the heart. I was grade 3, no nodes involvement. The oncologist said that in my case it could cause more harm than good and the difference the chemo would make if any wasn't that high as to put myself in some more danger. So I am left on my own to fend for myself and in the waiting game. Sometimes I feel depresse, and I am having problems in coming to term with my body, sometimes I feel I should hurry up and do all the things I wanted to do just in case. I have to speak with my nurse if I can get hold of her, I do feel a little abandoned just because I am not part of the main stream line of chemo or radio. Wishing you the best of luck, and be happy love Josie",
