At next Tuesday I will get results my second  biopsy about nodes.  I'm really scared,  at home I all the time talk : I'm strong, I never give up. We can do everything because we are together.  I see face my husband he is worried .  And I all the time think about my family.  STILL I CAN'T BELIVE WHAT'S HAPPEN.   Doctor told me we need remove whole my breast,  I said : it's OK,  it's just breast.  I can live without it...  Can you tell me how is look operation?  How long we need stay at hospital after surgery?  Thank you :*",
