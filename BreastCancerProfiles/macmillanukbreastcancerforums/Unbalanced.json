My toe nails are fine, but your fingernail description really resonates with me! Like you, I am keeping them short but once they start to grow they either split horizontally or bits flake off. I am going to investigate other recommendations and hopefully will see some improvement. UnB x",

      "Content": "Don't think I'm on the right forum, but you are the nearest I have found! I have secondary breast cancer (spine, shoulders, ribs) diagnosed in 2012. Was prescribed oral chemo (Capecitabine) until February 2016 and transferred to Letrazole. Now my fingernails (my former pride & joy) are revolting. They are splitting horizontally, are incredibly soft, ridged and lots of white lines (googled latter and it could be malnutrition!). Everytime they start to grow, bits flake off and so I have to file them down again or else they catch on my clothes. Life without fingernails is not a disaster in the total scheme of things, but it does make it very awkward to pick up small objects and even have a good scratch! I would love to know if anybody else has experienced similar side-effects from Letrazole and, if so, have they found a solution. Thanks.",
