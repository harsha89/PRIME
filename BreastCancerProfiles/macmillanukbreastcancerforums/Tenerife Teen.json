    "Content": "Hi Mirabo, I found the following on breast cancer are.org:- Hi to you all. I tried all the different makes.....Cipla, accord, Teva.....side effects weren\u2019t good at all so I went on to Femara but had to pay £120 a month. Side effects MUCH less with \u2018the real McCoy! Then I read somewhere about a make of letrozole called sandoz which happens to be made by the same company as Femara... I pay £12 monthly for this cos boots don\u2019t normally deal with this company so the £12 is a \u2018handling\u2019 charge. Same as Femara ingredients wise. Yes I still have some side effects but FAR less than the makes at beginning of this. My hands are the worst and I do get other joint pain but I reckon some of the side effects are actually caused by lack of oestrogen so as I don\u2019t want to die I aim to carry on taking these awful tablets. Good luck to you all. Worth reading the various replies as seems it's a common problem.",
