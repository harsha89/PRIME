      "Content": "I am very knew to this and have never posted on anything like this before! So... I'm currently waiting for biopsy results and feel like the wait is unbearable! I found a lump in my left breast about 4 weeks ago... doctor sent me to be checked with no hesiatation... 2 weeks later I'm having an ultra sound, having told myself that at my age they will turn round and say it's nothing, to then hear the word Biopsy! Now I've to wait until Wednesday for my results . I feel like I'm overthinking everything! Little things that were said like 'you must bring someone in case it's bad news' or even the nurse asking me if I had plans for the summer holidays (I'm a teacher) I'm now thinking... why ask me about something 2 months away? Sorry to ramble but this is all very sudden for me and not something I thought I would be going through at 26! Having breast cancer previously diagnosed in both my grandparents is not helping either! Having read a few posts previously before plucking the courage up to post one of my own you guys all seem very friendly and readily available to offer a helping hand of support ❤️. So I thought... why not.",

      "Content": "Apologies for a late reply. Thank you very much for your reply to my message. A fellow teacher too! Unfortunately, when I had my results on Wednesday it was confirmed as BC... taken me a while to talk about it hence why I've been quiet but now I'm fine... ish!  After further information yesterday, I am being referred to Newcastle for furtility treatment due to my age incase chemo impacts that! If I'm honest... that has been the worst thing for me to process. Also been told to prepare to lose my hair... again another thing I am petrified of!  I feel like I'm living in a bubble at the moment and talking about it like it's not happening. I'm very scared of the unknown so I think this support site is just what I need!  Thanks Kirstie xxxx",

      "Content": "Thank you both... yes I've been told that I will be having chemo... how/when/what type is still unknown to me.  Yes, I'm about an hour away from Newcastle... I live in Carlisle. Lovely places...  Oh Gay, interesting to hear you were told not to work during your treatment? I will find this so difficult...as it stands, because I don't particularly know much about what is going on yet I've naively assumed I'll work during chemo just with the odd day in between? But you're right... schools at times can be a haven for germs . Agh I'm sure all questions will be answered Wednesday when I get the HEr2 (that's right?) result... at the minute it's the unknown that is just so frustrating... having never seen anyone go through this before I've no idea what to expect.  Thank you for your replies again Kirstie  Xxxx",
