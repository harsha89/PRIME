      "Content": "Hi all Final chemo treatment next Monday, can't come soon enough! Surgery to follow. Know what to expect with that so no nasties there. Radiotherapy after that. Totally unknown quantity.  Any hints and tips please?   What sort of side effects did people have? All I know is that I will have it daily for 3 weeks. Thanks ",

      "Content": "Hi all I am at the end of my 5th Chemo cycle and everything has been fine until yesterday when my legs and feet started to swell quite alarmingly. Have suffered from pins and needles and numb  patches in hands and feet which oncology team knew about but didn't seem unduly concerned. Feet swelling went down a little bit overnight but as soon as I got out of bed has started to return.  Should I be unduly concerned about this and make a phone call now or do you think it can wait until Monday when I have my last Chemo? ?",

      "Content": "Got my node biopsy results on Monday. Tiny amount of cancer cells in nodes but so insignificant that surgeon not bothered about it and no change needed to plan. She said that they would take the nodes out when I have surgery after chemo. Did say that I would be called in sometime in new year so that the could put a clip in middle of tumour so they know what to cut out.  Anyone had this? Day 11 now after chemo 1 and I feel 'normal'.  Either I am just incredibly lucky or this is the calm before the storm!  1 day at a time. Anyone on here from near Plymouth?",

      "Content": "Had my third dose of TAC last Monday and it certainly isn't getting any easier. Having had problems sleeping last round went to GP and was prescribed Amitriptyline 2 x 10mg. No effect what so ever. Wednesday and Thursday felt like I was in 'limbo'  In bed but in a light doze all day, then at night awake at 2am and stayed that way. Struggling to drink any fluids as they all taste so rank or coat my mouth with a disgusting gunge. Here we are at day 6 and any food I try feels like it's peeling the skin off my tongue and mouth. On the plus side I've had no problem with temperature or infections so far. Sorry for whinging, I know a lot of you are having it much harder than me, just my positive attitude is seriously dented. ",

      "Content": "Hi all Had my first dose a week ago and am on TAC. Have to say that actual administration was totally hassle free and the nurse was fantastic, we had quite a giggle really. No side effects until the Wednesday went I felt dog tired and had a really foul taste and greasy coating to my mouth which made all food and drink unbearable.  Anyone got a good remedy for this?  Slept most of Wed and Thurs but brightened up by Friday. Biggest hassle has been that, being type 2 diabetic, chemo sent my bloods soaring, hitting 29 some days, which has resulted in yet more pills to add to the pile I'm currently taking. Bone pains kicked in on Saturday and were really bad this morning from pelvis down with a throbbing in my head that made it feel like the top of my skull would blow off. Hair still attached but nurse said she reckoned that being on TAC I will be bald by next session! Get my node biopsy results tomorrow. Not been as bad as I thought it would be so far, but every day is different and everyone is different. So glad that this forum is here!",

      "Content": "Well, had second dose of TAC on 21st.  Had same side effects as the first one but more intensive.  Hope this isn't going to be the pattern to come.  Had the same exhaustion but this time I didn't sleep for 2 nights.  That was an absolute killer.  Going to see my GP and get him to prescribe me something to help me sleep next time. Can do this but not if I cant sleep.. Leg pains started on Christmas Eve (day 4).  Mainly from the knee down and particularly bad in the ankles.  Anyone got any tips on how to deal with these?  Have tried Co-codamol but they just increase the misery of constipation. Still got disgusting taste and coating in my mouth which makes food revolting.  Biggest worry is my inability to drink enough fluids as even water is totally undrinkable. Not much positivity here I'm afraid, struggling a bit....",

Think I would have coped better if we hadn't had Christmas in the middle of it all.  Not a huge fan of the season anyway but now I'm going to always associate cancer and that smell which won't leave me with Christmas.  Am also having awful bowel pains today - the type that normally has you running for the loo but I don't have diarrhea. Also feel a bit wobbly. Temperature is OK,  37.2 Strangely enough felt OK first thing, it just creeps up on you.",
