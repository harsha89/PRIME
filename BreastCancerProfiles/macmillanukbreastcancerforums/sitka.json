      "Content": "I took Xeloda as part of a trial for Breast Cancer - it was great and I hardly had any of the side affects that were mentioned. It did however cause mobility problems and I have just been told by my oncologist that it has now been found that it can affect part of the brain and cause the problems that I now have. I hasten to add that it only happens to very few people I am just one of the unlucky ones. I would love to know if anyone else has had this problem. It wouldn't have changed my decision to take part in the trial if I had known - it helped save my life.",

      "Content": "I didn't have any of the side affects that I was told I could have. I did take special care of my feet and hands as one of the side affects could make them sore so I creamed them night & morning and they were fine. My main problem is this loss of balance which I felt came on whilst taking Zeloda and my Oncologist said it was nothing to do with the drug. However as I was on Tact 2 trial all the info goes back to a central source and on my last clinic appt. the Oncologist came in to me and said that they have now found that it can affect part of the brain which has caused my problem. I would say that it is a very uncommon sympton so please don't worry about it - Zeloda is super no bad problems on taking it - no hair loss - mine started to grow back as soon as I started - and most important at that time I could go away for a couple of weeks holiday taking the tablets with me - you definately need a break. All good wishes to your husband - I'm sure he'll be fine",
