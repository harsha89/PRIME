      "Content": "Hi, I'm looking to see if anyone is interested in a writing project where we write penpal style to each other over the next 6 months?  I am new to this site so hope its appropriate to ask for a penpal here. I was diagnosed with breast cancer back in April and now after surgery and emergency fertility treatment, I am on the journey of a 20 week chemotherapy program which will be backed up with radiotherapy for a month.  I am looking for a project to keep me busy for the next 6 months and thought it would be interesting to write but I am more of a letter writer than a blogger.  I think it would be interesting to compare experiences between New Zealand and the UK over the next 6 months.  Is anyone keen to be part of this project?  The intention would be to share our letters exchange in the future with others- they too may find some comfort. Cheers, Rachel Kia Kaha (translation from Maori: Stay Strong)",
