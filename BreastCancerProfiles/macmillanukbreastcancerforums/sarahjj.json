      "Content": "I was referred to the breast clinic after finding a lump in the upper outer quadrant. I had the usual tests, mamo and ultrasound. The radiologist said she didn't like the look of the lump so decided on a biopsy. When I returned to see the nurse practitioner she told me they had already made me an appointment to see the consultant 2weeks later and that I would need treatment but could not determine what until the results came back. I was to bring someone with me as another pair of ears would be helpful. Is it common place to determine treatment is needed before the results unless they have a strong suspicion of cancer?",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. I'm sorry if I come accross as being anxious and naive. I've been down this path before but never as far as a biopsy. I just got the impression that they seem to know something, almost giving it away but of course couldn't say. I'm a very level headed person as a rule but naturally am slightly anxious. I have plenty to throw myself into in the interim. Thank again",

      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone else experienced bouts of dizziness and fatigue even before treatment started. I only received my diagnosis 5 days ago but I have been feeling under the weather for a few weeks. It is quite likely unrelated but of course it makes you wonder if there is a connection.Â  I'm finding that I get four or five hours into work then feel unwell. It's not all the time but enough to be a concern. Sarah",
