    "Content": "I had myÂ  2nd FEC yesterday and my veins were already hardened slightly from the 1st treatment. I am having a Groshong line fitted just before my next treatment because of this. The Chemo nurses seem to think this is much better for me, it will save my veins and be easier to administer the drugs. It does worry me a little but they were all so positive about it I'm probably worrying for nothing. Karen",
