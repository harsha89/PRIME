      "Content": "Hi, I've just been diagnosed with breast cancer, it's only been a week so still having further tests. My husband and children seem to be having a strange reaction to the news, almost acting like it's nothing serious.  Perhaps it's just their way of dealing with the news!  Has anyone else experienced this?.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the replies. Tomorrow i have my first appointment at the Macmillan unit and then Wednesday I have an appointment to discuss the results of the second biopsy and the ct scan.  I'm scared but family are like \"you'll be fine\" and \"we'll deal with whatever we're told\".  Who's this \"we\"!  I feel so alone with my emotions. I've had colon cancer, just had surgery, nothing else, and I think they all think she got through that so she'll get through this, and I'm sure I will.  I think that maybe the way they are treating this news is making me more stubborn to deal with it all on my own and maybe that's exactly the way it's meant to be. I'll just moan and whinge to all of you instead xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi, Just wanted to tell you that I am having chemo, had three cycles so far, and I am using the cold cap and am using the paxman shampoo and conditioner (expensive at £25) but am only washing my hair twice a week.  So far it's working well with hardly any hair loss.  I am very careful not to put it through too much stress, using a very wide toothed comb and only combing it twice a day. I had very long hair and had it cut to shoulder length prior to treatment. The first 10 minutes are the worse, if you can just get through that the rest of the time is easier.",
