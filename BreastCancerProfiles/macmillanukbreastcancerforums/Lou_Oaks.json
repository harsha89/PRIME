      "Content": "Hi Everyone I'm not quite sure where to start or if there is actually a more appropriate place for this post (like a relatives/carers group?). My mum has secondary breast cancer (original cancer and mastectomy was 15 years ago, she was re-diagnosed just after her 10 year \"all clear\" after chemo and tamoxifen). The cancer is now in her: sternum, ribs, lungs (mostly the side of her mastectomy - it's about 80% cancer in that lung - seeing the x-ray was pretty horrific), stomach and also liver (that was found in October 2011). Mummy is the bravest person I know and has been so incredibly strong and positive. But her breathing is really bad now. She's exhausted and feeling fed up and understandably quite sad (she's on anti-depressants for about a year and they definitely helped). We have oxygen and a nebuliser for her at home and liquid morphine - though she doesn't like to take too much of the latter as it knocks her for six a bit. The last month or so has seen quite a steep decline. It's really scary and I wish there was more I could do. I live in London and work in the City but I come home (Hampshire) as often as I can and am home Tuesday - Sunday this week as Dad took a few days' work in Oxford. Work have been very supportive. I'm running the London Marathon for Macmillan this year and I'm raising as much as I can to help Macmillan keep supporting patients and their relatives & carers. That helps me feel like I'm doing something. But I'm finding it really hard now. She's really sick and I can't fix it and I can't make it better and I don't know what to do :( Running helps me de-stress, but I am feeling more and more anxious. I also feel a bit selfish for feeling this way, because she's the one suffering not me. Anyone in a similar place or have any tips? I'm an only child and very very close to my Mum. I love her and would do absolutely anything to make her feel better. Was gutted to find out I was the wrong blood group so couldn't offer part of my liver for a transplant. Turns out the doctor said they wouldn't have done it anyway as she's too ill at the moment. Enough rambling! Sorry for such a lengthy post. L x ",
