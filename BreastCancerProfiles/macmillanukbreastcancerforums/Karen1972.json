      "Content": "hi has anyone been suffering with hip pain whilst taking Anastrozole?  Im 45 and been on the drug for nearly 2 years, I've had the usual stiffness in my ankles and fingers but this is different as the pain worsens when wearing heels and exercising/walking long distances. At its worst it feels like the top of my right femur has fractured and I struggle to walk however with rest and ice pads/ibuleve it improves.   I've had an X-ray and was told it's bursitis.... I don't have any other red flags (no weight loss, no tiredness, no loss of appetite). I'm so nervous that I've also just had a bone scan however the results will take 4-5 weeks to come through. I'm worried sick as I'm convinced my cancer has spread. I was ER+ , Her2+, stage 3 DCIS and lobular cancer in my right breast. I'm eager to hear from anyone who has had similar symptoms. Thank you",
