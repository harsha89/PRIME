    "Content": "Hello, I'm just mid radiotherapy treatment, so am counting of the days!  Recent MRI has shown all clear so much rejoicing.  I was diagnosed DCIS last August and had first surgery in September, went in for a lumpectomy and also lucky enough that my surgeon was prepared/able to give me a Mammaplasty (reduction) at the same time.  Went from a HH/J cup to DD, in doing so they discovered some additional Lobula cancer and had to go back in to get clear margins which did knock me for 6 a bit. I believe that the Lobula didn't show up on the scans so it was 'luck' that caught it.   My mini boob is not enjoying radiotherapy in the slightest but I am very pleased I was able to reduce as I'm sure the pain and issues that often come along with radiotherapy would have been significantly more noticeable if I was still a large HH.  I'm 50 and have always had huge boobs so am quite looking forward to the more manageable sized D or DD that they will be at the end of the year (hopefully). This does mean of course that I am significantly mis matched at the moment, I've got to wait at least for 6 months post radiotherapy before the remaining boob can be reduced too.  So, its going to be a tricky spring/summer for me, but have enjoyed the excuse to snuggle in autumn and winter jumpers for the last few months.    So, my advice, if you've got an opportunity to reduce to a more 'manageable' size then it was a good option for me.  Also have to rethink all my 'dressy' outfits as apparently I've spent my life flaunting the girls!  Good luck RS",
