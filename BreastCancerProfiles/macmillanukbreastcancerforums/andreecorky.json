      "Content": "Dear Judith.   I am so sorry to hear of everything you have been through, much of which I can identify with, apart from, I am lucky to have a good family.   I lost my Mum before I was diagnosed with cancer.  ( My Dad died years before.)  I was having a very hard time coming to terms with her death and then just as I thought I was beginning to cope,  my bc reared it's ugly head.  It's so awful how it increases your anxieties too.  Situations I could normally cope with seem overwhelming.   Such a strange way for me to be feeling.  I dont know whether to laugh or cry sometimes.  I really hope that CRUSE are a great source of support for you and a 'Moving On'  course is available to you.  I'm sure it'll be of benefit.  I still wonder if my cancer will come back.  I'm sure it's the same for everyone. Doesn't help when you meet people who have just discovered it has returned after a gap of 16 years for instance.   But, I know we shouldn't dwell on these thoughts.  We must try and be strong and concentrate on what we like doing, hobbies and such like. I hope you have some things you enjoy doing.  I find tamoxifen has put years on me and some of the side effects are horrible. Just remember you are not alone Judith.   Sending much good luck your way and sincere best wishes.  A.Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi there.  Have just found this post and I can relate to it and most of the replies.  Thanks everyone for making me feel less alone on this horrible journey.    I suffer with anxiety as it is and I'm not the most confident of people and my own experience of breast cancer has brought me right down.  Yet, like so many have said, we do our utmost to keep smiling and putting on a brave face, when, quite honestly, all I want to do is go and lock myself away.  I have likened it all to a bad dream as well.  I really cannot get my head around it all.  One day I think I'm getting there, and the next, I'm right back where I started.  It's like 1 step forward and 2 steps back every time.  I'm feeling very self conscious as I've lost weight and people keep reminding me of the fact.  I know I don't look good right now (the tamoxifen definitely isn't helping) and I know I'll never be the same 'me' again.  I'm doing my best though, but I really feel overwhelmed by everything that has happened to me in recent times and I really do have days when I wonder what the point is quite honestly.  I have to think of my wonderful children.  I cannot understand how things can change overnight and they really do.  Good luck to all going through this.  We stand together!  It HAS to get better!  ",

I lost my Mum not too long ago, and I like to think she would have said much the same thing to me.  I miss her very much.   Wishing you all the very best too.  Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Ajmart I had my breast cancer journey begin in May 2016.  I had a lumpectomy in the June closely followed by radiotherapy which left my left boob noticeably smaller.  Also the nipples are not aligned very well at all.  I'm fine about it when I'm dressed as no one sees it but I do feel conscious of it myself when I undress.  My husband says it doesn't bother him but I just feel I want to do something about it.  I am going to ask if I can have anything done at all in the way of implants although I never really wanted to go down that route.  Mind you, I'm sure I read somewhere that not many surgeons will give implants to patients who've had radiotherapy.  Something to do with the skin being somewhat thinner on the treated boob?? Anyway, I hope you continue your upward journey.  I still get aches and the odd twinge in that boob but nothing to speak of.  My main bug bear is the Tamoxifen.  Hate it for all the side effects, but I guess it's a small price to pay if it keeps me cancer free. Take good care now and wishing you all the best.  Xxx",
