      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your replies. It is helpful just to know that other people have experienced this because I have found it hard to explain to anyone who hasn't felt it. It's also really good to know that it has got better for everyone who has replied, it is very encouraging. I was beginning to feel a bit disheartened that it wasn't improving but I think I was maybe expecting too much too soon.  My breast nurse has made a referral to a physio but in the meantime I will keep on with the exercises, and massaging. Thanks again everyone for your help!",

      "Content": "Hello, I am a new member here. I was diagnosed in October and had a lumpectomy on 6th Nov and sentinel node biopsy. Sadly the node was positive and I had an axillary clearance on 4th Dec. luckily all of my other nodes were clear and need-less to say I am immensely relieved about that. I still need chemo though which starts in January. My current problem is that I have developed cording from my armpit and down my arm. Extending my arm is painful and I can actually see the cords under my arm and at my inner elbow. I am doing all the stretching exercises religiously and massaging my arm. My BC nurse has referred me for physio but not sure when I'll get the appointment. Does anyone have any ideas on dealing with this problem or any hints or tips ( I also have  seroma under my arm, which has been drained once. filled up again but seems to have stopped getting bigger now). Any advice would be gratefully received. Thank you and best wishes for 2014 Linda",
