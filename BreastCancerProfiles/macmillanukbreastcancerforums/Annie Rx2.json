    "Content": "Hi Mandy - just to say completely understand how u feel. I'm 34 and got diagnosed January 2008, had mastectomy and armpit clearance then started my chemo in March. I was petrified about 1st chemo session and have to say it went really well and actually went out for a nice lunch with my husband when it had finished!! You do start to feel more groggy the more you have but they do give you fantastic medication to help you out!! Big tip though ... make sure you drink lots of liquid to make sure you don't get constipated!! Keep counting down the days, before you know it you will have finished!!! Are you having radiotherapy after you have finished chemo??? If so, please don't worry about that, as that really is a doddle!! Please let me know how you are doing and I wish you well!!! Annie x",
