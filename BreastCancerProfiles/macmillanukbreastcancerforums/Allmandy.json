      "Content": "Hi jesterdy, You are entitled to rant you have a hard deal and you are coping with ut. The problemwith coping is the more you do the more people expect you can do it. I fully understand althogh my issues are not as hard. I have a 12 year old dughter, a.9 year old son and my husband whose parents both died of cancer when he was a teenager and cannot separate the side effects of the tretment from the cancer itself! My oncologist suggested I should work if I can and that has beeen a godsend as it keeps it normal at home. However the veins in my doninant handare all rebelling from too much iv use and I am currently not able to drive and have been signed off work for a fortnight to\"rest\". My husband is finding this hard as he sees this as giving into the illness so now I have to cope with his issues, the stress I am causing school by not eing there as well as the pain and diability in my arm an te thought of more poison next week! This is rest? But then you rant and suddenly its like everyone else's world is being ripped apart by you!So as I said earlier you have my sympathy - rant all you can and hen you take back control and get on with it!!

      "Content": "Hi Caron, Hi Carron,   Re. the flu jab, I had mine and my pnemo vax jab as I don't have a spleen, before my first chemo and my arm was sore as aything bu I reminded myself that my uni mate Rach battled non-Hodgkinsons, survived and was wiped out by the flu, swine-flu doubly whammy last January so what's a pain in the arm compared with LIFE and why take on the chemo but leave yourself vulnerable to flu. So I enorse your GET THE FLU JAB suggestion.   Good luck with the chemo - my second one will be on Wednesday hopefully.   Mandy",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, Like others I was given the stray cancer inthe scalp fear which I thought was ridiculous and asked my sister who works in a path lab what she thought. She said the consultant in her lab had never heard of that one so I went ahead and enjoyed the coolness as a change from constant hot flushes! My hair remained through all 6 FECs although my eyebrows and eyelashes left me at the end. Good luck Mandy",

      "Content": "Hi Carole, I used the cold cap through all 6 FEC and only felt cold during the last 2. I lost a little hair around the crown because they put a cloth over that bit to protect it from freezing. The upside is it means you look 'normal'. The downside is it means you look 'normal' ! Be prepared for people to forget you have been through the trauma that is chemo if you don't lose your hair because everyone is so tuned into chemo patients being bald. Its great for not having to explain to those who don't know you but means you are far more likely to be treated as fully operational by family and work colleagues almost immediately because 'you look so well'! Would I do it again? I haven't made up my mind and hopefully won't ever have to try! Good luck Mandy",
