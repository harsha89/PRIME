      "Content": "I have had 9 months off work for chemo and radio for a triple negative breast tumour . I have returned to my job as a nurse In a private nursing home . I have done 2 weeks of reduced hours working alongside a colleague as my phased return . I did agree with GP this would be enough . I Now realise should have had a long phased return . I did one shift alone . I struggled both physically and mentally . Next week I anticipate I will be expected to be in charge for my usual 4 shifts . I dread it . I fear I will not cope . I hate feeling so useless and tired . ",
