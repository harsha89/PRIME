My anc drain came out before I left hospital the breast one a week after... a book bag with long straps is handy to carry around and loop over arms of chairs etc.  I lived in leggings and vest tops (could pull the vest up over my torso then hook the straps over arms) if I got cold an oversized shirt was good. I only wore front fastening bras as couldn't put my arms behind to do up iyswim. I slept with 3 pillows so extras are good..  Was given gabapentin for the nerve pain/spasms (anc pain is worse than the mx pain but manageable) after which helped only used a couple of times but meant I could sleep (wish I had them now..  tamoxifen + hot flushes = no sleep!lol)  Do the exercises from the leaflet as soon as you can, the more movement you can do early the easier it feels.  Good luck hope it all goes well, remember to rest and look after yourself too xx",

      "Content": "Hi, thought I'd add my five cents worth... I cold capped. Had 6 X fec 100 so was told would definitely lose my hair. In preparation I had it cut shorter about chin length, btw I had lots of hair, my hair's fine but curly.   I had the Paxman cooling system which was put on for 30 mins before chemo then had to stay on for 3.5 hours after treatment. Won't lie, was the worst bit of the chemo treatment for me and as the sessions went on it got harder as my hair thinned about 50-60%. Is an intense pain for about 15 mins they changes to a dull ache a bit like toothache. I Finished in January and now have a full head of hair ☺️. It's short (for me) and much thinner but the thin spots I had from where the cap didn't fit properly have all filled in. I've dyed it also so now just have short hair. I nearly gave up after chemo no.2 as loads came out and I felt sick thinking about having it again, but I persevered and am now so glad I did.  Tips - make sure the cap is snug to your head no air bubbles, only wash once or twice a week with very mild shampoo & conditioner. I used the Philip Kingsley no scent or colour it lasted throughout my treatment and as had no smell didn't make me feel ill by association (some money goes to a BC charity too). If using the Paxman system look at their website it's v.helpful and when I emailed about tips to get over the nausea by association and told them that the chinstrap was tight and dug in they rang me and sent me a larger chin strap for me to use and really encouraged me to keep going.  It's tough but doable, just like the chemo, good luck with whatever you decide xx",

Was put off initially because of this but I cold capped for my son really, he was 10 and was devastated about me having no hair and would get very upset talking about it, this swayed me I think to try it... I took some nurofen before I arrived at the hospital and had the cap fitted, it is very tight and causes a lot of downward pressure as has to be snug so all your scalp is covered... the initial cold sensation is very intense and painful, lasts about 15-20 mins then changes to a dull numbing ache is difficult to describe but I found that I couldn't really concentrate on a book so watched TV as could tune in and out. I had 6 x fec 100 so had to have the cap on for 30 mins before chemo then 3.5 hours after for it to work. After it comes off the relief is immense, and I did have a residual headache which lasted for a few days which may have been the chemo or the cap... it did put me off but by week 3 thought i'd try again .... so.. I persevered even after masses of hair fell out after the first one, (beanies were my friend!) each chemo after, I have to say was harder and harder as my hair had thinned so my scalp was more and more exposed... The headaches were about the same though in intensity and duration for chemo 2-6. BUT... I'm glad I kept going, my hair is thick and curly now, the thin patches filled in within weeks and I could go without a hat whilst having radiotherapy and it just looked like i had a bad cut with bits sticking up all over the place lol Icelollies make me feel nauseous even now and I wont be wearing a hat in a hurry this autumn, but yes am still glad I did it for my son and for me... Just realised my first chemo was a year ago today! wow that has flown by! Might be worth seeing if you could try one on and see what it feels like in terms of the pressure from the chin strap etc? Anywho, good luck with whatever you decide, even if you just manage the one at least you had a go! all the best, Nix x",

I play netball and carried on playing throughout (only on my third week after chemo when I felt better), then I started to play every week when radiotherapy started. I wore a tight sports bra with my softie and found that it ached a bit after especially the node scar, now six months later I still get the odd pulling sensation and ache but find that the day after training it feels fab as has loosened the area and made it much more comfortable. I will say during and just after radio it was more tender than normal, but is very understandable as there has been so much trauma to the area. I take ibuprofen if it gets too sore but most of the time it's fine and after a couple of months I even forgot sometimes which was amazing    If you're worried I'd give you're bc nurse a ring as she can probably give you any advice you need, Nix x",

A friend of mine has had an ld flap and it looks amazing (she had it 5 years ago didn't see at the time but she said took a while to settle). Are they planning any more ops to shape/augment them? The loaf under your arm should settle down but it does take time. I'm not surprised you're still tired it is a big op, the psychological impact is as great as the physical. I hope it all settles down for you soon and that you have lots of help and support. Like JJ I'm planning to have a bilateral mx and diep recon next year...  it's not going to be perfect, they won't look the same as before but will hopefully end up with a pair of boobs I can live with. I walked into theatre for my sentinel node op and my mx. Was asked if I wanted to go down in the bed or walk, I felt more in control walking, iyswim. I agree if you're not happy you should tell someone. Your BC nurse or consultant maybe? As Misty said keep doing the exercises they really do help, take care, xx",

But it worked, I lost about 50% of hair mass, had the odd thin spot but my hair now is thick and looks healthy so am pleased I persevered. (May never eat an ice lolly again though!)  Week one of each chemo is tough, I lived in a fog for 7 days but by day 10 I started to feel ok, food tastes naff for a while, sweet and salty foods tasted best. The fog lasted longer as the sessions went on so by the 5/6 one it was 10 days not 7.  My 5th chemo was the 12th December and I still had a good Xmas, could taste and enjoy food I had a glass of prosecco which was recommended by the chemo nurses!  My advice, eat what you want, sleep when you need to and don't be afraid to ask for help Good luck hope all goes well for you Nix xx",

I can't believe how quickly mine had thickened up, the top is a bit 'tufty' only the left side feels thinner.

The Pagets was found after my mx. I had no lumps visible, mine were picked up on my annual mammogram and MRI so was told not to kick myself that I hadn't felt anything.  Am waiting to have a bilateral mx and diep recon - are you happy with yours?

I think I checked my temp morning and evening, or if I had a headache that wouldn't shift or felt extra rough then I'd take it before taking some paracetamol. It really does hit you for six especially the first one as you have nothing to Compare it to.  Try to take it easy try and drink lots of fluids and sleep when you feel like it. I didn't really feel that sick but was given emend so maybe that's why, also had neulastin injections to boost my white cells so luckily didn't get any infections.  It was a humid evening last night so maybe you were warm due to that?  Maybe check every 3 or 4 hours until you feel a bit better and if you have any doubts ring the hospital again. Take care, is horrid, I still remember the way I felt with a shudder but hopefully by next week you'll start to feel a bit more human again.. is lovely having a week of feeling ok it's like the sun coming out after a storm..

The scar is in a naff place I think, would be better a bit lower as vest tops  highlight it but am still glad I had it done as know I'd never have coped having the chemo through my veins normally. I didn't feel a thing other than when the needle went in to set it up each time.  Am rubbing bio oil in the scar now so hopefully it will fade away eventually, but if it doesn't it's not a big deal, is small fry compared to what we've all been through treatment wise, have plenty of other scars...

I was told that the chemo generally continues to protect for a little while after you finish (am having a preventative rh mastectomy next month, finished chemo in January and at last check up voiced my concerns about having to wait so long for the second op, that's what my consultant told me probably a fob off but made me feel slightly better!) Just imagine how ill you'd be if you weren't well before your op....  it takes a lot out of you and you need to be 100% strong to recover :)  You're obviously still a bit low so try and boost your immune system, lots of vitamin rich foods, soups are fab for that, if you don't feel well enough to go out for some, have you a friend or relative that can get some for you? Maybe you need stronger antibiotics too? Keep chatting on here, having a moan is fab, but mostly take care of yourself and try not to worry too much ( I know easier said than done) Big hugs, Nix xx",

I don't think they go fully back to \"normal\" until you've finished treatment. I can't say I was particularly careful then, I just carried on, watching the foods I ate, washing hands regularly and trying to avoid people who were ill.  I had Neulasta injections the day after chemo so had a boost each time, luckily I didn't get ill through my chemo. Just look after yourself, keep taking your temperature, if your levels are too low it may delay the next round, but the blood test before treatment will check that.

My advice is talk it through, I was told that it was my choice whether to have it as I had only one node involved, there was no evidence that it would benefit greatly but I wanted to throw everything at this and be able to say I'd done everything I could to try and stop it coming back.  Moisturising was the key for me I think, I burn in the sun, then go brown so was conscious of this, I used Moo Goo Udder cream, and also Aveeno. Aveeno in the morning and the moo goo at night. My skin did feel tight and tingly but not too red and it didn't blister or break. I finished radio 21st Feb but am still using the same routine.  I'd go to the planning session, see how it goes, ask loads of questions, then make your decision, Good luck Helen, hope the rest of your treatment goes well  Nix xx",

Waking from surgery I had intense pain in the centre of my chest and think this was what woke me from the anaesthetic. I asked for some pain relief which I was given and thankfully worked, was told it was where the muscle goes over the implant it's a particularly sensitive area, after that was just a bit achy really, nothing major, the drain is a PITA as you prolly know... It does take some getting use to when lying down as feels odd it almost digs in, I still can't sleep in certain positions but it does get easier...  Am also having a mx with immediate recon on the right side but later this year due to having radiotherapy, when the temporary expander will be replaced with an implant ....  Good luck with the surgery hope all goes well for you Nix x",

I get very dry skin patches generally so didn't really think much of it.... I was told it was probably related to the tumour that was near my nipple (I was greedy had 2 of the buggers!) so am glad I had a mx without sparing the nipple as it would have been a waste of time... they may biopsy the area to see if you have it.  I had an MRI guided biopsy on the tumour near my nipple which was a bit unpleasant but don't have experience of the Paget's tests... imagine though they need to take a sample of the area and run some tests, Hope it's not too bad for you, Take care & big hugs  Nix xx",
