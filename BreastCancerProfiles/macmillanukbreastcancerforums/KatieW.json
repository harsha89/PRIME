    "Content": "franm_1962 Ok here goes. I have had breast cancer. I have been on tamoxifen, ethermestaine and been on Letrozole for some time. On Wednesday I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. They gave given me tablets from diabetes called Metformin and then and atorvastatin for high colesterol. Letrozole gives you high coltesterol and high blood pressure. Right? Does Letrozole mirror symptoms of diabetes too? Does anyone know? I was on tamoxifen and started with Type 2 diabetes soon after. I am now on Letrozole and my diabetes has improved. I've gone from 2 metformin tablets down to 1. I suffered from gestational diabetes years ago when I was pregnant and this went as soon as I had my kids. I am convinced that the diabetes is all related to hormones and the increased oestrogen levels but when I've queried it with nurses they dismiss the idea. I'm managing the diabetes fine so I'm not really worried. My cholesterol has also gone up since taking the Letrozole though so as well as cutting out sugar I'm trying to avoid cheese which I love!!",
