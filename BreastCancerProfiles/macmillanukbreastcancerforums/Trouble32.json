      "Content": "Brilliant advice thank you MoMo2626, I will phone on Monday if not gone. You've reminded me I have ones to take at set times but another I can use when needed, there is so much to remember so I am writing down a plan to capture things simply. I'm not sure how much is reaction, relief I've been through the first session or just nerves.  Appreciate the fast response, thank you",

      "Content": "Thank you so much lizzie in the Blue Room for starting this positive thread. I have just read my way through and agree with so many of the comments including those from Maria, Helen, Smaryn - The NHS is amazing, there is no way I could have had all that treatment if it was not for this wonderful service. The staff are amazing, so busy  but made me feel like the most important person. I had my second operation last week and whilst on the ward noticed how many professionals were there just for us; it was humbling to realised how much expertise, experience, skill, dediction and care in just a few feet of hospital space. We really are lucky. It has been a grieving process, for a life I feel i should have done more with, or jsut too much to cope with in such a short space of time, but I was so lucky to be screened early and cancer detected early, however my mind feels like it has been on the spin cycle of a washing machine for weeks! Good things do come out of this, friend new and old have amazed me, I'm normally the one who organises and looks after others so being on the receiving end has been a new situation. As others have posted support has come from all directions and I never realised how many firends I had, in all shapes and sizes.  Like others I have seen some people clearly and have had to walk away, but that makes room for new good stuff. Finally Jacky.2108 your post was brilliant - I am definitely living by option 2 - with the occassional drift into option 1 on a 'feel sorry for myself day' but option 2 is a brilliant description - thank you. To all the ladies and gents, we are part of a brilliant goup of people, thank  you to all that post. Keep smiling :) Julie x  ",

I have my radiotherapy induction session on Wednesday following chemo and surgery, so like you Eden just starting this new adventure and wondering what it will be like. Wishing you all the best and I'm sure with the help of the folk on this forum we will both be fine. X ",

      "Content": "Hi I finished chemo in May after 7 months and started with the cold cap but did loose hair so gave up in the end. Hair now growing back. If it is not on your list of things to take please take a towel to the hospital because when they take the cold cap off my hair was frozen solid and then started to thaw. I discovered the paper towels provided did not soak up water . I also found sucking on mints helped and taking layers of clothes as the ward varied from very cold to very warm.  Wishing every chemo warrior the very best; you can do it. I'm starting radiotherapy now so will check out the link provided - thank you ",
