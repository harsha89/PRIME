    "Content": "Hi Monet, I had similar after my 2nd FEC, I was told by my chemo nurse to put a heat pad or hot water bottle over the vein and rub Ibulieve on the affected area. I did go on to get phlebitis close by to this but I think this may have been due to my veins going into hiding! When I got this I was given diclofenac, antibiotics and movelat to rub in. After this, I went on to have a picc line fitted and haven't looked back since! I'm just waiting for it to be removed after finishing chemo! Hope this helps Ax",
