      "Content": "Hi Gina I also got my diagnosis at my initial appointment so a I had to hang around the hospital for a couple of hours before I felt okay to drive home. I know that feeling of shock as do most of us do on here. You have a chance to fight and you have already taken the first steps in that battle so well done. Next you will get your battle plan. I was a stage 3 with heavy node involvement diagnosed in April last year and here I am in July 2015 and have just joined the Neddy (No Evidence of Disease) club. This could be you in 12-18 months time. Lots of help and support for you on here but whatever you do .... don't go to Dr Google. We all have individual and unique journeys. I have only just started to look in Google now that my treatment is complete and so much of it has no relevance to me whatsoever and it would have distracted and distressed me unnecessarily. Ann",

      "Content": "Hello jemilyxx I can't add much to the excellent advice you've already had, but I would say that if your Mum is at all claustrophobic it may be wise to ask for some sedation for her MRI scan. Personally I found it tough as I went in face down and of course was in for what felt like ages. For me that experience really brought it home to me just how seriously ill I was (note WAS as I am now 1yr+ clear) and once that kind of thinking kicked in it made the scan very difficult to endure. If I ever have to have one again I will definitely ask for help.",

      "Content": "Hi Rob, Don't know if this helps but when I was diagnosed the Oncologist told me that there is such a rise in the number of men being diagnosed with BC that they are considering starting a clinic just for the men. Also, when I phoned our Accountants and apologised because I had made a small mistake with some figures but hoped they would understand because my head was all over the place as I had just been diagnosed with BC. The guy I spoke to said \"Really? Well don't worry too much....I had it last year and I'm doing fine now\" Just like that ! I was so surprised. Now we chat regularly. You mention pushing your family away. Could it be that you are used to being in control? That's how it was for me (as a single parent) I was not used to others taking over or trying to take decision making etc away from me. ",

      "Content": "Hello, I look in on the forum most days and I was wondering if I could ask some advice. I had node clearance when I had my mastectomy in May 2014. A week last Friday I cut my thumb on that side while I was peeling veg (and daydreaming). A small cut but it oozed blood and clear fluid for 4 days afterwards and still hasn't healed. In my previous life ... BC....(before cancer) this would have healed in no time. Does anyone have any idea how I can help the healing/will it ever heal ? Ann",

Do you think  I should still be having any follow up with them? I do still have regular checks at the BCUnit (6 monthly) ",

I don't know why but I have been so emotional about it!  I saw a young girl there today... probably about 18...there was a Consultant clinic running and it looked so much as though the news for her wasn't good. I just wanted to give her a hug. ",
