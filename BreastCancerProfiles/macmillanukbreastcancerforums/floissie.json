      "Content": "Hi i have had chemo radio and mastectomy and am taking anastrazole. I have had lots of pain in thumbs and index fingers along with involuntary spasms and seizing , and after reading the side effects of the tablets come to the conclusion its trigger thumb. I spoke to oncologist about it and she said she couldnt confirm that it was the tablets but will review it again when i go back at the end of november. The pain is still getting worse and my left thumb has now completely seized up and i cant bend it atall and now the right one is following suit. Is there anything i can do to try and help with this or should i see my GP and see if they can help me.",

      "Content": "Hi Louie, I was diagnosed in January this year. I went to docs with a painful armpit and whilst at the docs a lump appeared over my collar bone, so i too have it in lymph nodes. I had 6 cycles of TAC chemo and had mastectomy and lymph node clearance 2 weeks ago. Results show i had a good response but out of the 6 nodes they removed 1 still had cancer cells. I am at the moment awaiting radiotherapy. It will be interesting to see the difference in our treatments as my docs havnt suggested more chemo even though they have told me there must be more lymph nodes with cancer cells in left that they are unable to remove.",
