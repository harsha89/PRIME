When I got my results last tuesday about one node out of the 2 they took being shown as cancer in it, I was very very low, and wednesday was one of my lowest days so far. But being on here, has helped and lifted me since then.  But you do need to say what stage/grade and results of other tests on here for other people to give you some sound advice of what they have been through, as its all different for each person.  xxxx",

I had my results on Tuesday and am very very disappointed. The margin around the lump is clear, and one node is clear - good news, however, the other node showed cancer, so I am now having to go back into hospital next week to have all the nodes removed.  Apparently this is the next \"step\" , and to be honest Im not the sort of person who lives for the short answer.  Everyone told me to be positive pre results day, and I thought I was, and I was let down, what if I get let down again on the next set of results for the nodes removal. I have always been a strong independent person, but I am so low, I have not felt this low since my dad died. I play hockey, I have an allotment, I do not sit down and Im not a good patient, and I feel my life is out of control, and Im not good with it. Now I know that there are other ladies out there who are probably far worse off than me, but my family have never had inkilings of breast cancer, I thout I was doing everything well to avoid stroke and brain haemorrage in our family, and I get this,,,,, I never saw this one coming. Im angry, low, and I dont know what to do. I dont know where to turn, Im emotional and I dont do that. Stiff upper lip and all that,  I want to get back to normal and go back to work. Has anyone out there been through the same as me. I have a stage 2 lump removed and it was 2cm if that helps. estrogen clear. How do I cope with no nodes, and if its in the one how do I know its not gone into the rest of the body. thanks xxx",

Consultant didnt say anything about PR - all he mentioned was Oestragen which I was fine for, and HER was fine, so that was all good.  I had a hysterectomy in 1999 and my ovaries died 2 years ago and Im not on HRT as they wont give it due to migraines, and I dont suffer any symptoms of any kind.  I hate taking tablets anyways, and 5 years ago was diagnosed with under active thyroid, and the tablets made me feel crap, and I ran out so didnt get to chemist for repeat prescription for about a month, where I felt great, so I didnt bother taking any more, and since then they just send me for monitoring every 3 months for a blood test and my TSH levels have been up and down, and last bloods for that they were ok so dont have to go for another for 3 months but then had to go with this damn lump that I found quite by accident and the rest now as they say is history.  So all good apart from the one node showing cancer cells leaving me with another op next week for anxcillary node removal. To be honest I dont really understand, Ive just got his thing in my mind that says if its in one node then its already in my system, and Im scared.",

So the last blood test I got a letter and I thought here we go again...go and discuss your results, but no, blood test form inside and the letter to tell me that I dont need to go and discuss, that things seem to have settled this time, and have another test in 3 months time.  So Im ok with that.  My brain has now a more serious road to manouvre, and thats the one Im struggling with, although yest and today are slightly better in myself so far, I only actually cried twice yesterday instead of all day, for 2 days x",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for all your comments, and i got an appt yesterday with gp, and apparently after going thru the normal process of i cannot ring up on the day for an appt due to work, which is why i book them in advance, receptionist then tells me there is a slot at 1050 yesterday, so i said i would have it thanks, and then she also tells me because im a \"purple patient\", i can insist on seeing my gp at any time,, who knew!!!!!, so after going in with some snippets off here, and ready for a fight,, gp tells me he can give me the brand that i need, no problem, and that he fully understands the awful side effects of differing brands,, omg, i told him he is the first medical professional i have come across, thru all of this that understands the issues and i thanked him for that, and he said no problem, but getting the chemist to supply the right one might be more difficult, and after going over to the chemist across the road from gp, they have Teva in at the moment so i said no thanks, and asked why its such an issue being able to order the right one as its no cost to them, no cost to supplier it all gets costed to your gp and his budget, and he fully understood that but he said it does come down to cost, but he will speak to all his suppliers and see if they have any Accord brand, and order them in for me, but he can only try. They just get sent what the supplier has at the time when they put their order in. So then off to the hospital pharmacy who have supplied it the last 2.5 yrs, to see what their problem is now, and oncology nurse could have done this but hey pass the buck and i will be mentioning it at my next appt even though its not til jan.  So spoke to lab technician who its their job to get the meds in that are rquired, and she was lovely, and she said she had just had a quick look on system to see what the issue was and apparently there is a problem with Letrozole as a whole across the branded board, but she would need a few days to delve deeper with manufacturer etc, to make sure they order in the brand i have and it will be ordered in solely for my prescriptions only, and that that was her job to do this, because im not the only one on any meds that need a certain brand. She was totally understanding when i said i cannot go back there on cipla or actavis or teva, so all being well it will work out, but i havent got the tablet yet so we will see. So next steps are to pop back next week to chemist to see how he got on, and hosp pharmacy will ring me with conclusions. So quite a productive day, but not complete, so rationing my tablet now to every other day so it gives me a few days longer before running out. :)  xxx Sally",

Do not worry about other aches and pains, Ive had to slap myself and have a word with myself, just think about the fact you may have had those before your diagnosis,but didnt really take much notice, but now they are exaggerated by the fact you are going through this.  take care xxxxx remember one day at a time as I keep being told..xx Sally",

Your husband will NEVER NEVER know how it feels to have cancer unless he gets it. No one knows about the emotional and mental turmoil you go thru, and will always go thru even though its technically gone physically. Mentally it will never go away but you do have to get on with your life otherwise all that pain and suffering will be for nothing for you. I have no further words for him, except he is a selfish :::::::::::::. God forbid he gets it, because I wouldnt wish it on anyone but if he does if he was my husband I wouldnt be going to his appts with him. all my love Sally 22 months clear I am, but still have niggles off and on, and will do for life, even the emotional stuff xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Karen,  you need to speak to yr oncologist if you cannot cope, because I am on the Accord brand of letrozole and that's OK for me, still get joint pain but you will on any of the tablets they give you. But if I go on any other brand I  am a 90 yr old cripple in 3 days of being on them. You need to get a brand that suits you better. But you need to trial and error unfortunately which takes a bit of time, I was going to change and try tamoxifen but I then changed my mind in that it's better the devil you know after reading other posts.  Hope all goes well but don't suffer so you can't function or sleep cheers Sally xx",

I thought about the cap, but I suffer from migraines so it was not advisable so binned that idea especially when its not guranteed that it will work, and seeing everyone faces that has had it on yesterday all squashed up, and having to be in the unit for more time before and more time after chemo with it on didnt feel me with much happiness, so I made the decison not to do it, esp if I went through the pain of having in on and then lose the hair anyway, but again its a personal choice.",

      "Content": "Hi no problem, i actually didnt know that the indentation is one of the factors, and i just thought it was an older age thing as im 54 now but was 51 when it was noticed, and then only actually noticed the lump by accident 3 months later, having had a mammogram 18 months before and all clear, so if i had not noticed the lump by accident, it would have been a further 18 months before i went for my next mammo. So some would say i was lucky, maybe i was in that instance, but obviously not so lucky to be told that it was early stage BC, and a complete shock to say the least because i have always played sport, got allotments, ate healthy stuff albeit the odd cake or so. But all around me could not believe that i got this. So after discussions and research it doesnt matter what age you are, or anything, its not just genetic, it is totally random, there was a lady on here last week aged 24 who was just diagnosed, and when i was initially with BC nurse, she said my hospital alone average 8-10 positive diagnosis a week, which totally shocked me.   Im now 3 yrs on from diagnosis and surgery, next month will be 3 yrs since chemo started, then oct will be 3yrs since radiotherapy, and then on letrozole which is a sod in itself, but im now on a brand of the tablet that is not so bad, i am still playing hockey, still doing my allotments and walking the dogs, everything i did before, but with joint pain from tablets, which only happens after i get up from sitting down so if i didnt sleep or sit down at all, i would be fine lol silver lining and all that, but its pushed to the back of my mind otherwise you drive yourself mad with all the what ifs. I now have given up sugary stuff, any white goods, like rice, bread, pasta, although never a big pasta fan. I take tumeric every day, fermented fish oil, and vitamin D, so i get by but some days i still have a sobbing session, but apparently this is good for you, and you need to get the stress out. Stress being one of the biggest factors in BC. I also do weekly tai chi class which is so relaxing and i have reflexology once a month. Im not one for sitting down for long. lol All the best for you guys, and being on here will help and support you immensley should you, god forbid, get disappointing news. cheers Sally",

But they reckon 6 months, maybe less dependant on type of chemo, and radiotherapy which I knew on the lump area removed 1 month ago. also a tablet of some inhibitor for 5 years, so any of you got any advice on what I will expect, anyone had the cool cap during chemo to stop you losing your hair, what it feels like, side affects of it. any help would be appreciated. Not the news I wanted, or hoped for, but no more surgery they tell me. I was so positive at this 2nd lot of results and have had the rug pulled from under me yet again.

      "Content": "Hi All,, I was put onto Letrozole in October 14, and I had the ACCORD brand from the hospital whilst on Rads, and all was fine for 4 weeks, then had to get a repeat, whereby the local chemist gave me the tablet made by CIPLA, omg within 2-3 days i was crippled, with bad joint pain, and when on here asking it seems there are 5 companies who make Letrozole and its the fillers/coatings on the tablet that causes the issues, so if you have been put on it and find a brand that suits you YOU are entitled to have that brand and your GP just needs to put it on the prescription for you. Im now back on the ACCORD brand from hospital as discussed it with oncologist at last appointment, and she said I should not be inpain, we need to get you on the treatment that suits you. So I got another prescription from her, and I can now get this from hospital. BUT in saying that if your GP puts it on your repeat prescriptions then ANY chemist[boots told me this the chemist herself], are obliged to get it for you because its not them that are paying for it as its your GP that is paying for it... hope this helps...

Sometimes it feels heavy and like its massive but when you look at it it actually isnt, you just have to be careful in not cutting yourself on that arm, and if you do clean it straight away, I havent cut myself and Ive got an allotment, and I use gloves for most tasks anyway and always have a set of antiseptic wipes up there. If you are careful you will be fine.  I had cording afterwards, but my BCN showed me some exercises to do and it was gone within a month, to stretch it out is painful but the reward when its gone is great, and Ive been fine ever since and that was last April,, best of luck Sally x",

      "Content": "Hi, they are not saying less scans, just gaining information on the frequency, it could be you have more but every 2 years, as it is under the current program it's every 3 years, and they do call u b4 50, I was called at 47 then next one was 50 which was clear, then 18 months later I only accidentally found my lump, so if I hadn't it cud have been another 18 months b4 it was found at next mammogram, but if it was 2 yrs as is part of the research, it would have been found at that point ie 6 months instead of 18. And going on the trial means I get looked after longer after my treatment, I'm 3 yrs on from surgery, chemo,  rads, and only have 2 yrs of after care left to get to the 5yr point, where I would be \" on my own \" again, which scares me. This way I get another 7 yrs,  so yes it's me looking after me. I discussed it with many.  You won't get yearly mammograms once you are discharged it goes back to every 3 back on the mammogram screening programme. And if they didn't do the research we were all be stuck in the dark ages and nothing improves. They will also be talking to me, again as part of the trial, the after care, quality of life after treatment etc, it's not just about mammography periods. Quite frankly i would be silly to say no, whereas now i can have my say for future womens treatment and I'll also be bringing a stern rant up about letrozole shortage and the brands difference  Cheers sally",

      "Content": "Hi Flopsyuk They tell me that they really have no real evidence on what the good or bad frequency is for mammograms etc, ie should it be every year, 3 yearly, etc plus some patients have expressed how stressed and anxious they get when they are due a mammogram, so it may be that  a breast clinic will take over any appts, investigations, and care, reducing hospital appts or not, making the patient more at ease, less anxious and stressed, plus enhancing the care given, but until they have studied various individuals on the trial, they cannot make any formal decisions for future care for women.  It wont affect me now as im now 3 yrs in, but it may help women in the future who get this dreaded disease, and to apply resources much better, more efficiently, and less on the patient and resources, or more resources after all the discussions have been had on the trial, and it may not change it may be that what happens now is still good to go for some years yet. Im sick of going to this appt and that appt, paying for the parking every time, getting anxious before i go, hoping they dont find anything even though ive checked myself, but be aware, it doenst matter how many appts you go to, you are only as good as the scan thats taken that day, the day after could all change hence why we have to be vigilant ourselves. like me i had a mammogram and all was clear, then 18 months later get a lump, and i only found mine by accident so i guess in that respect i was lucky or not whichever you think of it Sal",

I do exercises on the affected breast to move any fluid across onto the good side where it drains away as normal. But  seeing adverts and it on the radio all the time doesn't help. I use the allotment for my sanity where I can switch off from everything, plus weekly tai chi session. You just have to manage it but it's bloody hard and frustrating  xxxx Sally ",
