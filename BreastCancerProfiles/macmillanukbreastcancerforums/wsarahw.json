My legs however, are baby smooth & shall we say, the fluff is leaving the fouff!!! lol Looking forward to no having to shave my legs for a while!",

      "Content": "OMG! Had such a fun afternoon yesterday trying on all sorts of wigs! My hospital in Oxford has a marvellous shop & the lady in there was FAB! I ended up buying something totally different to my actual hair! & I LOVE it! After the major chop last week I have a short style, my wig is lovely long blonde curls! lol, I did think I might get a shorter one later on as actually I'm still not sure I'm going to wear it, thought I'd better have an option available though! Think I might just rock the Sinead O'Connor look, unless out to dinner! Tip - try them all! Its great fun!",

      "Content": "I've decided to take the plunge and have my shoulder length bob turned into a pixie cut! I've had 1 session of 6 FEC-D and tried the cold cap, which, ok was uncomfortable, but actually seems to be doing the job! So far, and I know the next week or so are make or break, so good and it's not falling out! However, my roots, which I've not shown for over 30 years are showing dreadfully! And vain cow that I am I dont want to walk around looking messy! I'm obviously avoiding having the colours done and I think its time to embrace my natural hair colour (whatever THAT is!) It might seem a bit drastic to just have my hair cut off when I'm trying to preserve it, but I've taken the attitude that the cap will fit better next time and if it's going to fall out anyway there's not really much I can do about it so, in for a penny!!! I'm quite looking forward to having a change too! Am I being a bit drastic?",

      "Content": "It's  a skull cap that has a gel inside, it's connected to a machine that cools it to -5 whilst youre having chemo. I think if you've already started treatment it can't be used, had to be right from the start. The theory is that it constricts the blood vessels to the scalp so the chemo doesn't get to the hair as much as without it. I've had quite good results so far, although I'm shedding a little it hasn't all fallen out!",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone, I have calmed down a bit & had a wonderful experience over the weekend! I took myself off christmas shopping wearing my wig, mid M&S i got a bit warm (God! It's hot in there!) so toddled off to the loo. Looking around, there was only one lady in there waiting for her daughter, so mumbling apologies, I whipped the syrup off & delved for the beanie hat. \"oh, darlin'!\" she trilled, \"Been there, done that!\" and then proceeded to give me a great chat telling me all about her hair & to embrace it and not let it define me!  She was AWESOME, a total stranger who just gave me a bit of kindness and sent me on my way with my head held high. Got to love the British public! xxxxx",

If you do go fo the crop, a few tips I got from a friend, 1. silk pillowcase - AMAZING!!! you can't believe how stubbly your head is and they dig into cotton!! 2. Oil your head! Sounds daft, but I've got a little bottle of argan/moroccan oil & it keeps your scalp lovely 3. Primark do wonderful beanies for a couple of quid, find one you like & buy loads 4 You think people are looking at you more than they actually are! lol Good luck with the crop xxx",

      "Content": "Tuesday was the shitiest shittiest day EVER! After all my bravado of \"oh, it'll be fine, it's just hair\" I ended up a total blubbering snotty mess. I had a shower and it looked like a hamster had died in my plughole. Seriously, the water was struggling to get down the plughole. I had more hair on my chest as it ran down me than I did on my head :( No1 son was awoken by mother blarting like a baby in the bathroom. He was great, mopped me up gave me a big hug & generally cried with me (he's 6ft2 with a beard, so that upset me that he was crying too) Anyhoo, I phoned a good friend who had been through this 3 years ago & bless her, she literally dropped everything, came round & took me to the hairdressers. My lovely stylist Charley, then proceeded to do the deed, It had to be done, I was hoovering the bed in the morning there was so much fluff on the pillows, I was in danger of blinding anyone standing behind me in a breeze. She told me to bring my wigs (posh one & the £8,99 ebay one!) and cut them to suit my face, filled me full of tea & chocolate biscuits and sent me off feeling a bit better. It feels really weird in bed, there are still prickles, I still can't look in the mirror properly, but everyone who knows me say the wigs look fine & I have a good shaped head! I still feel like I've lost part of \"me\", silly vain woman that I am, I'm more upset by the hair than the loss of half my boob :(",

The anti sickness tablets they give you seem to do the job for me and I wasn't nauseous at all! My taste buds definately changed, and I couldn't stand milk in my tea for a bit, but that seems to be clearing now thankfully. It sounds weird, but it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be! Hopefully, this will continue, good luck with your treatment xx",
