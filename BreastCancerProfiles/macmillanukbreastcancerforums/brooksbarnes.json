    "Content": "Hi Nerfertiti I know exactly how stressed and confused you must be feeling right now. I was offered the Optima Trial and truly believed the odds, (after the further tissue testing)  that I would NOT have chemo were, as you say, like entering the Lottery - you buy a ticket but never expect to win!!  Well!  I did!!  I am one of the few who is not having chemo but having Radiotherapy instead.  I have been prescribed Letrozole (Estrogen inhibitor) also.  It took a lot of thinking about as I thought Chemo would be 'belt and braces' - i.e.  what nasties the surgeon didn't get, the Chemo would.   I am just about to start Radiotherapy (planning meeting 3 June) after removal of a lump, followed a month later, by another op for lymph node clearance. Ever the optimist, I'm going to give it my best shot.  My advice, for what it's worth - listen to what your Surgeon/Oncologist/loved ones have to say, and then go with your gut feeling. We have no control over this awful disease, but we do have control (some!) over our treatment Good Luck x",
