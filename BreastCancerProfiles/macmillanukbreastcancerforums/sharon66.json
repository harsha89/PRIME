      "Content": "Hi I bought a wig that was almost the same colour as my natural hair and a similar style and took it along. Toni and Guy are amazing they operate Strength In Style and the stylists are really well trained to help people cope with hair loss. My own hair is now 2 inches long on top and 5 inches in length and today they have added extensions which look fab so no more wig . I got the extensions through Racoon International and they give you a massive discount and Toni and Guy sponser Macmillan. Ive had a few wigs one from the hospital and in the end I bought my own from Hot Hair which is usually based in Selfridges and are online the cost varies. Definately get your wig sorted before you lose your hair you will feel so much better once you have it in place. Good Luck Sharon x",

I am so pleased with the service I received from them I know you can get a hair cut anywhere but they have had that extra bit of training that makes all the difference. Mine was like a ball of frizz too and its actually grown back very curly and uncontrollable which is why Ive decided to have a few extensions put in. Good Luck Sharon x",

      "Content": "Your not being stingy at all if they ask for as much as Debra says then I would look elsewhere I do wonder how they get to that ridiculous price to shave someones head, I actually pulled what was left of mine out then went to the hairdresser at the Christie Hospital and she shaved my head for £10. Ive concentrated more on Toni and Guy since my hair has started to come back and will definately stay with them until my hair is back to where Im comfortable. Don't know if you read that they have just done my extensions they are not mega long or even loads of them just enough to fill in the bits that are slow to grow back but I couldn't afford them forever. Good luck with the cold cap I never knew about it at the time but it definately worth a go. Take care Sharon xx",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothee No I don't think it happens to everyone please don't worry. They can use a different vein each time and the best way to get a good vein is to drink lots of water and put a heat pack on before treatment. The IV for herceptin is tiny as well and once it is in you can just sit back and relax and let it do its wonderful job. You can get joint pain from the treatment but simple paracetamol and ibuprofen will ease that. Hope this helps. Take Care Sharon :) xx",
