      "Content": "Hi everybody, I am a 'newbie' so any advice will be really appreciated! I had my Grade 2 surgery last Tuesday and am going for my results on Friday. It all seems a bit unreal as it has happened so quickly so I am not really sure how to feel or what to expect! My underarm is so so sore where the lymph nodes were removed and I am not joking when I say that I stink! Am not allowed to get the stitches wet! Any advice would be great. I feel like a bit of a fraud having read what some of you brave people are going through but I thought it might help to chat with some of you as it is quiet a lonely place to be. Xxx",

      "Content": "Oh wow! Thank you all so much for replying! Jobey can I ask why it has taken so long for you to start radiotherapy? Is that because you got the all clear and it's just standard practice? They said that I will have to have it as well every day for 3 weeks- 15 min sessions, no idea what to expect from that! Good luck to you all for tomorrow xx",

      "Content": "Hi why do they think you will need chemo? I might be strange but I am just thinking that I will get the all clear on the results, get dates for the 15 min radiotherapy and go back to work next week! I am worried because I am not worried if that makes any sense? I have the numb feeling as well and very sore but not unbearable...the smelly armpit is worse!! Are you resting every day Bubbleblower?
