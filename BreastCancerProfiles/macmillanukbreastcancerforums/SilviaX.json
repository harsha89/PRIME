      "Content": "I had 2 operations in August and September (to remove some bits left) for estrogene receptive primary breast cancer. Thanks god there was nothing in the nodes. The biopsy showed that everything is out. So I decided not to do any radio or hormone therapies as I think they only would damage me. I don't think statistics are right and I have also read that many cancer patients die of cardiovascular diseases because of these damaging treatments. So what is it all about?  Now here is the way how I see what is called 'cancer': To me cancer is only the tip of the iceberg of underlying problems who have been there for many years, which haven't been visual and couldn't be addressed therefore. Thanks to this 'cancer thing' they became visual now... For me it makes sense to address now all these problems and sort out my life and I don't see what radiotherapy has to do there, nor hormone therapy. If there is a hormonal imbalance it is up to me to figure out why that was....hormone treatment does not assist me to bring back the balance..it just reduces the estrogen. It does not make any sense...????? So let's say my hormone system got out of balance or supressed because I was sexually abused and raped and after that my sex life totally upside down..why would then a doctor try to reduce my estrogene? Or let's say because of depression I didn't eat enough and didn't do enough exercise? How would the radio therapy, which would damage my heart and lungs be good for me? I would rather need a fitness and nutritonal guide?  What lifestyle changes did you do? I would like to list my lifestyle changes here: No deodorant, no beauty products, no make up,no hair dye, organic washing liquids and shower gel/shampoo. Exchanged any cleaning liquid to vinigar or Ecover. Eating no sugars, a diet rich in oily fats, greens, whole meal products, fruit (berries). No alcohol or caffee. Eating mostly vegetarian, only sometimes fish. Reduced use of mobile phone (radiation). Avoiding polluted streets. Walks in the fresh air and daily exercise. Meditation. Finding all energy blocks and fears, analizing everything back to my childhood. Making new energies free by doing all the things I wanted to do before, but was afraid. Correcting and reassessing relationships with human beings. Sorting out any human conflicts I had in my life. Contacting these people if necessary and talk. being really honest and trying to say openly what I want. Make sure that I drink more than usual and sweat, so the body is always well flushed. keeping a healthy weight. Sleeping enough. Doing only the things I really 100% want to do in life, no compromises. Trying to be in line with the natural world, reducing anything which would harm nature and wildlife. Life and the abuse we do to life is the problem and not cancer. WE and the society and attitudes are actually the problem and not the cancer. The cancer only makes us aware.  I would like to hear from others what work they are doing to sort themselves out? And what we can do to address toxic products sold to women, sexual abuse and hormonal damage to women, air pollution caused by industry and radiation. Even if 'cancer' comes back...we at least could improve our life quality anyhow? There is in any case only one way....and that is improving all these things...",

      "Content": "My main question in this blog was what positive lifestyle changes did you do thanks to cancer? My life quality improved about 100% thanks to cancer, which seems to work like a door for deeper insight and awareness into life. It's like finding the iceberg.  How can it be prevented to sell all these toxic chemicals to women? Only we women can just not buy these products and come up with new business ideas.  Also endocrine imbalance and disruption can happen after rape and sexual abuse, because the whole sexual life is being disturbed and it makes it more difficult to express ourselves sexually if we have to fear abuse.  Many awareness campaigns are running already..  I only give an insight into my 'iceberg'. What I want to find out is what was your 'iceberg' (insight) and how you could improve your life thanks to cancer? ",

      "Content": "Yes true, best thing is to just stay healthy. Then I don't need a doctor! :) And there is a lot of fun in being healthy:) Good sex life, taking on new challenges, feeling fit. cancer taught me quite a bit which is great! There is far too much fear mongering around cancer in my opinion! I hope you are well too! x",
