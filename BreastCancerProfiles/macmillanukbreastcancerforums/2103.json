      "Content": "Hi Jan I feel your pain.  I had my first Docetaxel at the end of January and I was in agony with aching joints too and was laid up for about three days.  Paracetamol and Ibrufen just didn't even touch the sides.  I called my consultant and explained I was in so much pain along with all these other side effects that kept popping up! When I saw her last week before my second dose she prescribed me some Naproxen tablets.  I took them on the third day ready for when the aches kicked in and kept taking up to four a day.  Although the aches were still there they were more bearable and she had even increased my dose for my second one too.   It's horrible isn't it.  I seem to have a lot for side effects from this than the FEC.  You've probably had a nice hot bath ... I put one of those heat things you put in the microwave on my back.  The aches latest a few days.  I had my chemo last Tuesday and I am pleased to say I am not aching now but still feel rubbish with other side effects. I am sure your consultant will give you something to help the pain.  Those tablets really helped me.  Worth a try! Hang in there and I wish you all the very best. x",

      "Content": "Wishing you luck for tomorrow.  I remember feeling like this.  I am currently going through chemo every three weeks for six cycles and I am just recovering from number 5.  The finishing line seemed such a long way away and now I have only one left.  It does go quite quick. Everyone is different how their body responds, but just listen to what your body is saying and just rest rest rest and take any offers of help that people give you.  The first few days were the hardest for me and I just rested and drank lots of juice and slept. Despite how rough I felt at times when I went to see the oncologist the day before my next treatment and had a measure of the tumour hearing that it had shrunk each time just kept me going and made all the suffering worth it!  My tumour measured 10cm x 7cm and after chemo 4 was 3cm x 2.5cm ... so it's doing its job. The breast care team are amazing and are there for you and just tell them how you feel each time and they can usually give you something to help with the side effects. Hope it all goes well for you.  x",
