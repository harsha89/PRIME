      "Content": "Hi Flute You poor poor lady. See your GP straight away, I am on Citalopram and that can take the edge off. You jumped straight back into the stress with your job too. It must be difficult to unwind. You are not alone. Post treatment is strange. It is like leaving hospital with a baby for the first time and looking about and saying what next? You say you are tired but no wonder with what you have achieved. I am having enough trouble dealing with going back to my part time job and hay fever . I think the previous lady is correct, if you post your area we will try to find you some friends to have coffee with. I am in Cambridge. Good luck Caroline",

You are not Her 2 positive, that is really good news as I am. Take it one day at a time and the future takes care of itself. Don't fret just because it is cancer. These days the doctors do wonders.",
