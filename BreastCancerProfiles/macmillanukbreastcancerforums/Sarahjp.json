    "Content": "My hair is finally growing back after my chemo. I have to say that I was devastated when I was told that I would lose my hair and I did try with a cold cap, but really couldn't get on with it. I have worn a wig for the last six months and only my husband saw me with no hair as I didn't have the confidence to go bald and proud like some. I have had many compliments about my \"lovely hair\" even from some of the nurses at the hospital who really didn't know that it was a wig. Do whatever makes you feel comfortable, but it will grow back and wigs can be great!",
