      "Content": "Yes so I have been begging my medical team to do a scan to see the progress of the chemo on the tumor and they refuse to, and it\u2019s not because of insurance. They just are demanding that I do 6  chemos and then they\u2019ll do any type of scan. I can already physically feel that the tumor has reduced drastically or even disappeared. I really don\u2019t feel having 6 chemos will make a difference. Anyways, I have an appointment next week with an integrative MO to get his opinion. Thank you for your response. ",
