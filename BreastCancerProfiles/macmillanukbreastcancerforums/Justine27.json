      "Content": "I'm 47 my mum had breast cancer at 49 and pasted away 6 years later I had breast cancer last year having had lumpectomy and radiotherapy and have been on tamoxiphen for a year but it caused 2.5st weight gain leg cramps bone pain hot sweats and flushes so oncology took me off tamoxiphen for 2 months which every thing improved apart from bone pain in this 2 months. I went back on Friday and he said about taking my overies out so it brings me into an instant menopause and then I can go on arimidex he said my bone pain will be worse but I won't put weight on which is my biggest problem and will go through anything as long as I can loose my weight But reading online today it looks like arimidex does put weight on and I really need to know if this is true or not before I have overies out can you advise me please",
