    "Content": "I just read your post and am appalled at the way your Uni is treating you.  I know how hard it is to get your PhD and the games that Uni's can play when you need time out for medical reasons. As others have mentioned there should be a student advice centre, or an academic advisory service that is independent of the department you are in and who should be able to give you clear unbiased advice.There should be policies and complaints procedure set out. There should also be mechanism to allow you to extent your PhD studies due to the time you have missed. Alternatively there are external bodies that you can complain to such as the Office of Independent Adjuticator. http://www.oiahe.org.uk/    I wish you all the best for the future and good luck with the PhD.  Wease ",
