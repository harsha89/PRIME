      "Content": "In the past twelve months, after diagnosis of triple +ve Stage 1-II-B, grade 3 breast cancer, I have had chemotherapy, surgery (lumpectomy), radiation and adjuvant therapy via a daily aromatase inhibitor pill for the past 5 months. I am not appreciating the side effects, namely and most importantly impacts to my brain function (there are plenty of others but that is the important one) - intermittent memory loss, and I have found some scientific articles that can attribute brain function to these hormone drugs. Last week I had a brain scan that confirmed nothing suspicious going on in the head with my hippo-campus so therefore in my mind it is all the drugs. I have been a science experiment for 12 months and now want to say that's enough as the benefits Disease Free Survival are not enough. Only a 5% difference I think. Am I reasonable to give up the drugs? I think the body needs to get back to a drug free baseline and maybe I would start again... Like",

      "Content": "Very happy to report that my oncologist agreed to six weeks drug free. I went in with a lot of research evidence that drugs change your Disease Free Survival odds from 8.8/10 out of ten to 9.5/10 , in my mind not a significant difference. Furthermore I found research that it is still beneficial to restart if whatever reason you change your mind.   I proposed stop for 6 months and we compromised to stop for 6-weeks (including cancel the last 2 herceptin infusions) and 6 weeks should be long enough to tell whether the arimidex AI is causing brain issues. I cannot find enough words to tell how much weight was lifted of my head, chest and heart just by being drug free...can't stop smiling....of course I do realise that the the drug regime over the last 12 months does not all disappear in 6-weeks...but it certainly feels good. ",
