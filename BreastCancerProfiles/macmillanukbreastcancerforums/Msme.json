    "Content": "Hi all, Its nice to read that your all getting on with things and sounding positive. I am 32 and have been diagnosed with breast cancer.. I have already had the lump removed but was advised at my post op results appointment that they did not get a clear margin so I have to go back next Wednesday to have a more removed or a mastectomy they advised the later because of my age apparently a high risk of the cancer coming back and because its grade 3. Following that I will be going through chemo then Radiotherapy and tamoxifen.. I am terrified to say the least... but to read all of your posts somehow has made me feel a little better. I only joined today and I am glad I did... sometimes it can feel very lonely. I have a lovely boy friend... we have only been together since 30th Jan this year.. he was my childhood sweet heart. He is the most amazing person I have ever met and believe that we were meant to be together... but at this time because he makes me feel strong and gives me another reason to fight. Unfortunatley he lives 4 hours away from me but has been here for every appointment I have so far and is always on the end of the phone.. I have a little boy who is 3 he also is a huge reason for me to keep going ... and he forces me to keep going. Well I am waffling on... I hope you all continue to keep strong Take Care xx",
