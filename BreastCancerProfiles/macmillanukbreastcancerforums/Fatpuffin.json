      "Content": "It is hard to do, but slow breathing consciously relaxing into it and not fighting it and pretending you are having a nice swim near a hot beach helped! And paracetamol. And rubbish comedy on iPad. My hair thinned but I would say it's worth it psychologically. My onc said she would def. recommend to avoid the psych. Issues of losing hair when you are already low and confused. I didn't have to go through wig and trauma of them taking wig off so for me it was worth it. Only down side is no one knows you are ill! Good luck, and hugs to all xxx",

      "Content": "Hi. I asked a breast care nurse if it was normal to feel grotty 7 months after chemo and rads and she suggested going off tamoxifen and taking notes. It seems to have made me less emotional hurrah!and achey and have more energy and that awful tired bones has stopped. But now they are talking of letrazole and I'm concerned? Has anyone any experience/ knowledge of the two? Onc said letrazole bone thinning rare and they would scan my bones to keep an eye out. That doesn't sound good! Surely by time its detected its too late? I see from other threads my reaction to tamoxifen seems normal. Am tempted to soldier on as if I know it's what's causing depression I should be able to cope. All tips and experiences gratefully received!",

      "Content": "Oh isinglass I was so pleased to read this. No you are not alone, and now I feel less alone too.  I'm a year post masec too. And chemo and rads finished end of April. So yes, like you I'm jolly pleased chemo worked.but it's weird.its like it didn't happen. It's like I should be over it. It's like I'm clinging on to cancer reading this site and looking for solace when I should be moving on. I'm forever changed and I'm thrashing around trying to fit my life and I don't anymore. I just want to make it all better..stress free..get my positivity back too. It's like I've fallen through the looking glass into a bleak world with nothing positive, no joy. It's horrible. How can I understand that my life has been saved and I can enjoy it? How do we get to be one of these people that decide they'll completely change their lives and climb Kilimanjaro and have fun? It doesn't help that I am struggling to find work. Husband thinks I should go back to old high powered job and doesn't realise technology has moved on. Shouts if I suggest shop work. Feel so useless. Stuck at home all day feeling useless and guilty. Driving myself on to decorate/ iron/ cook etc but he doesn't see anything has been done. He never has and thinks he works hard while I laze around, so I work more and don't take time to eat or excersise and I'm soooo tired. which is obviously silly. Sorry, going on. Just struggling and it is lovely to hear someone else is not a positive polly. I do silly things like forget to call the bank, ..it's cos I'm doing other stuff, but he gets irritated with me. Find myself almost looking back on chemo with fondness. At least you got some sympathy. I just want things to change. I'm sure I used to have opportunities and fun and now it's like everything has closed down and I'm stuck. Completely and utterly stuck. Help!",

      "Content": "Hi Julia, thank you very much. Yes, I am seeing someone at maggies once every three weeks.it seems to boil down to, be nice to yourself and do nice things.  I do sound self indulgent, sorry! Just having a bad day I guess. Can you possibly tell me what happened to get you out of your bad state? I'm looking for tips! I do do some painting which makes me feel more energised. It seems whenever I do that, I cock up on something else and annoy hubby. Agh! Just need a job, then all will change. Sorry am sure I will be embarrassed when I read all this back in the morning!  X",
