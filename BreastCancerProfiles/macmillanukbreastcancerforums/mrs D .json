I have since starting my journey realised how much we take for granted in life. A wage coming in, a day out and so much more. Friends mean the world most of the time but true friends stay true at a time that matters. My one and only big brother never really spoke to me but we are now true family. Having cancer no matter what cancer changes your complete attitude on life and people around you. I have the most wonderful husband and the kindest and caring family I feel so humble towards them.

Good news as mum has now resolved herself to the fact that they need some help so big bro is on that case, they are also sorting some meal deliveries out. Knowing that has put my mind at ease a bit. To be honest with you I havent felt much different on the reduced dose, I have still been very knackered and had joint pains galore. But like you 1 to go. Hope your bloods are okay. We have booked 2 nights away end of June before my op to Whitby. Staying in a guest house overlooking the abbey I have my eldest nephew n his family live there but dont want to stay with them we just want to chill. Let me know if chemo on, Love Pat.xxxÂ ",
