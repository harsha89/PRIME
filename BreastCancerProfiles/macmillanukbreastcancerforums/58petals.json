    "Content": "I have been diagnosed with very early breast cancer, just yesterday in fact, stage 1, very small. I am in the middle of moving 300 miles and so my care is being transferred, which is fine. I have been told what my treatment will be, lumpectomy and node removal, radiotherapy, and hormone blocking meds. Then I think they will say it has spread. To say i am scared is an understatement. I can't think about anything else, it's awe consuming. I feel my world has come to an end and i will die. I'm getting pains everywhere and thinking it's spread, the sight of my biopsy was very bruised and only now after 8 days is it starting to hurt in my shoulder and back under my arm, apparently this is normal but i expect Â psychological too. My husband has been ill and underwent a quadruple by-pass in january so it has been a year we want to forget, I am 56 and have a 12 year old son as well as 3 older children and 7 grandchildren. Are all these feelings natural? Will it get better? I need some sort of reassurance so I can get on with my life while I await my appointments, I know i need to be positive as i have a lot to live for.",
