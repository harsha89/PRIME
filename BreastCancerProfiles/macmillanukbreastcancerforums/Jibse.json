    "Content": "Hi, My Wife had lots of Chemo, and she always religiously wore the cold cap. I understand that it was uncomfortable for her she and it added 30mins to the treatment time. which wasn't helpful. She had very fine hair (Blond) but she kept it all as far as I could tell, we did take advantage of the wig provided to her but she never wore it after the fitting day. because she never needed to. She was very possessive and concerned about her hair. But it always looked good even after the end of the Chemo. She lost hair elsewhere on her body but not from the head which was, of course, the place protected by the cold-cap. I would suggest that while not being an easy option to increase the treatment time it was well worth it, and would recommend it totally I know my wife was extremely happy about it and was pleased that she had taken the trouble to wear it.
