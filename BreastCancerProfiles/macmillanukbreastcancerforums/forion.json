      "Content": "Hi Oldhat sorry to hear you been little weepy etc etc it is such an emotional time going through all this chemical shite!!!! but there will be light at the end and a MASSIVE party for us all. I am too to start 3 x Taxotere starting the 1st april and am very anxious about it as been told it is the strong one and having had 3 fec and have really been not as bad as I though.  I thought the worse senario on each occasion and imagined to me bed ridden but have been ok only a few days of tiredness and one sick day off the first lot even go to work as and when on a normal week as I call them.  so for the nurse to say only people with problems go on here is rubbish we ARE ALL going through this togethe and no matter how fan family and friends are there are only is woman an here that can totally understand.  I find that the nurses only seem to tell you tiny bits of information as in mmmm some people are sick some are not some people sail through some dont, so really it doesnt help at all.  I value everyones comments on how they feel and tips for getting us through the side effects ie. lollies for sponge mouth day the nurses have not gone through chemo so dont know about these fab tips we have found out ONLY be being on this site.  Oh another one i read about is licorice (ha ha check my spelling out) is good for mouth ulcers!!! . With regard to scar I had a lumpectomy and 25 lymph nodes removed and was told the scar would be like the crease under arm etc etc and its isnt!!!! had operation 25th nov and scar is still redish and lumpy but have been recommended Bio Oil but at the moment I cant touch the skin makes me feel sick as in why had it and what it all represents silly I know but thats just me. Going back to Taxotere think it is going to me more of a painful treatment that sick and fatigue after reading various posts on here like feels like been hit by a train and on very high painkillers - Tramadol which dont agree with me at all and after taking to some woman at the clinic who have had one session of Taxotere even to just vac up is such a painfull experiance so think we are on for a hard time BUT PLEASE ,NEED TO KNOW THE WORSE SITUATION for prepare myslef and anything else is a bonus.  Oh yes the nails as well after reading on here to nails will fall off most of them and asked nurses and they said oh only very very exterme cases which is crap as after reading on here thats not the case so dark nail polish is on hand for that too. I do find some days hard with having what we have or had should I say I am only 41 and have two fab girls age 2 and 9 I find it sad for them to see their mummy go through all this but time is going fast and mid May is final chemo then three weeks of radion and then 5 years of medication!!!!! but as long as it kills and stops the cancer thats the main think. Well its a horrible rainy day today so the cinema it is i think!!!! have a lovely weekend all and everyday brings you closer to the end of treatment . fiona x x",

      "Content": "Hello   Thanks for info about Breast cancer and links etc Noj. I too have been recommended something which is a natural boost that has been recommended by a friend of a friend on web site below, then click cancer help (info below) I bought the liquid form of this as didnt want to drink the tea, dont get me wrong it tastes horrible!!!!! but just have drink of juice or milk straight after.  I have only been taking it for a week so cant judge just yet, but like i said a friend of a friend took it all the way through chemo and blood count was always excellent and she felt fab most of her treatment so i thought give it a go!!! ~~~~~~~~ This potent herbal remedy has been used for centuries as a treatment for cancer by the indigenous Indians of North America. A nurse, Rene Caisse, was given the formula by an elderly patient who had recovered years earlier from breast cancer. Nurse Caisse (Essiac in reverse) developed it and for nearly 60 years ran a nationally celebrated cancer help clinic in Bracebridge, Ontario, treating thousands of patients successfully, refusing to accept any payment. This is the authentic herbal recipe prepared as Rene Caisse advised (beware of expensive imitations!), keeping alive her dedicated work. The special mixture of these four herbs: organic Sheep sorrel, Burdock root, Turkey rhubarb root and wild crafted Slippery elm is found by some to be effective in oxygenating and purifying the blood, stimulating new cell growth and strengthening organs. Can also be used as a preventative. www.sulis-health.co.uk ~~~~~~~~ I have also been juicing a bag of spinage with pineapple every few days and drink it all  to boost iron intake for blood etc sounds vile but tastes nice but is very green ha ha. Since having 2nd chemo been feeling brilliant dont know if it is that but been feeling good!!!. Bye for now Fiona x  ",

      "Content": "Hi all hope things are going ok with side effects and chemo etc!!! I am due to have third FEC on 11/3 feel ok about it but then will have 3 x Tamoxifen like you BEV51 how many will you have.  I have been told by chemo nurse it is a very highly toxic mix of drugs and reading some side effects doesnt sound nice.  Not looking foward to nails falling off but was told by someone to try and paint them dark and hopefully that helps. Been very normal after last chemo just have lots of spots on bald head red and sore but dont know if reaction to all flase tan keep slapping on ha ha but is sore and face is very itchy too like something is under skin all odd, eyes brows still here but they itching too so dont know if thats a sign the hair folical is dying.  had couple of days little tearful but more thinking of what is to come for the next 5 years!!! until hopefully given the all clear but who knows eh.  But like you Bev looking at booking a summer holiday start of aug and hopefully will be off to our favourite greek island of thassos but been looking at holiday insurance as have to declare breast cancer and for family of 4 looking at £150.00 a lot of money but has to be done. so yes round three on 11th march but half way there then!!!!!!! thinking of you all x",
