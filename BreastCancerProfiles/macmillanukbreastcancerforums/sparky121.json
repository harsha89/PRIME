I decided to eat something before Docetaxol because I had to take steroids, but kept it to a minimum. Was OK afterwards apart from my tongue which was completely white and horrible. Ended up going to hospital and being kept in for 48 hours due to low white blood cell count so risk of infection. Pumped full of antibiotics as a precaution which was really annoying as I didn't have an infection anyway just a risk of one.......next dose on Thursday - will let you know how it goes!!!",

Think there may be more risk of lymphodema and cording once all the nodes have been taken away so it is important to follow the excercises they give you. It took quite a while to get full movement of my shoulder back and I did have some cording but this has now improved. I still have a numb area in my armpit which tingles sometimes like you have been stung by stinging nettles. Sometimes my hand and lower arm swells a bit and I have to massage upwards to move the lymph back up my arm. Wasn't really to painful though and I recovered quickly with no bruising or swelling. Hope all goes well - will be thinking of you. Cassie xxx",

Some days carrying on as normal may be best and others she may need some support. Everyone's cancer is individual to them and the way they react to treatments varies so much there isn't a definitive answer. I think nearly all of us felt really fit and healthy prior to diagnosis - it is generally the appearance of a lump that signifies there may be a problem, not any physical pain or feeling unwell.

      "Content": "Hi Sammy99, I know how you feel cos things like that worry me too and I just finished rads yesterday, after chemo which finished in Oct. Please remember that everyones cancer is different and is also diagnosed at different stages so just because we see or hear one sad and terrible story it doesn't mean that your story, my story or anyone elses story will be the same. I must admit I was feeling great yesterday and on a high after finishing my treatment and seeing that (I have 14 and 15 year old girls who need me) made me feel a bitndesperate for a while.....BUT I have had the best treatment I could have for this and so have you. I will be on Tamoxifen for the next 5 years and I am determined in my own mind to stay strong and not allow it to come back. My Onc on Wednesday said 'don't allow what has happened to rule the rest of your life - go sky dive, bounce on the trampoline, do whatever you want and live your life'. Maybe easier said than done but if I sit at home worrying it will have won. You are doing really well - you are nearly at the end of chemo and rads is a breeze after that. It is infuriating when people say you look well when you feel like crap, but I decided it is better than them saying you look awful so I just smiled (like you) and kept going - maybe it's a coping mechanism. When you do get to the end of rads and feel soooo much better like I do, hopefully you will make more sense of it all and realise you are going to be OK. Hugs. Cassie xx",

I did sleep quite a lot too....BUT, the second dose was much better with much less side effects and the third dose went so well I dreaded swapping to Docetaxel, so there is hope that things will get better for you xx I had a Picc line and it drove me mad for the first two weeks. The line dug into my arm and made it sore and I had pins and needles and it constantly needed re-dressing because it bled a lot. However, the Onc said it would settle down after 2 weeks and it did exactly that, after which I had no trouble at all with it and by the time it was removed I never gave it a thought. It was defo worth it for the chemo as not worrying about needles made it much easier. Try not to worry about it all - I'm sure both the chemo and the Picc line will get better xx Cassie xx",

Hopefully we will both be back to normal soon!! I know what you mean about feeling tired. I have just gone through a bout of it and also my muscles from my knees to my thighs ache, but it's all bearable at the moment so I hope you will feel better soon. I have a feeling it does stay in the body and affect you for some time - my husband is under the impression that I will be back to fitness in 3 weeks time!!!! probably not quite!!!!! I think perhaps you should check with someone if you're feeling really tired as it would help if you knew it was normal or expected before you have your op. Sue, I would feel deserted if my Onc says he doesn't want to see me for a year. I know we are brave ladies but I feel some form of support and reassurance would be nice. I expected it would be every 3 months to start with and then 6 months etc. I have a pre chemo review tomorrow so I will ask my Onc what happens at Northampton and let you know - if he says a year I will not be a happy bunny!!

I was tempted to go down the alternative route but decided in the end I would have the chemo and then look at alternatives to help prevent any recurrence. So, basically, good luck to you and keep posting - we need to hear what else is out there and how it is working. Cassie xxx",

      "Content": "Hiya, I know how you feel - I am heading towards my last chemo and then radiotherapy and am wondering how I will feel after that. All the time I am being treated I feel as if something is helping to fight against it. Will you be on Tamoxifen - I suppose I feel that will be the way to keep it at bay when radiotherapy is finished. I am also determined to keep off all the weight I have lost and do everything I can such as excercise and diet etc. to keep it away. However, I was pretty fit and healthy prior to being diagnosed so I don't know what else I can do really. I have decided to try and live my life, go for checkups and not worry until I am told there is a problem and I need to worry - not easy to do but if I live my life worrying every day I will be breathing but not living and that's not me. Sorry I can't be more helpful. I really feel for you and hope you find a way to get through this - I am sure I will struggle to when my last appointment is done. Hugs, Cassie xxxxx",

Lets face it, if the world had ended yesterday, as some said it was going to, none of this would matter anymore. Concentrate on the 'now' and try to forget the past and the future for a bit....Tax is hideous and makes you feel awful which doesn't help with trying to think straight. Try not to google because I have tried and you can go from feeling really positive to incredibly negative in a few seconds (and back again sometimes), depending on what you read. Remember, everyones cancer is different and other factors such as age, general health and fitness and lifestyle are considerations which probably aren't included in prognosis and stats. You are you so try and stick with that and tell the nasty cells to s** off. Love and hugs on a horrible and wet saturday which I am sure doesn't help. C xxxx",

I think back to being diagnosed and how those small works 'It is cancer' change your life so much. If they could have just said it is a cyst it would have all been sooooo different. However, whatever gets thrown at us we will deal with it and get through it. Finished chemo today and don't like the thought of having to go through anything more than rads now and tamoxifen. I asked my Onc about follow ups and he said 6 months with a surgeon and then another 6 months before I see him ie: a year from when he sees me after rads. That sounds similar to wht you said the other day Sue. I find it bizarre that they aren't going to check chemo has worked etc. It seems such pot luck. Maybe chemo was never needed, maybe chemo was needed and worked, maybe it will work for a while, maybe it hasn't worked at all.....who knows. The only way for me to deal with this is to live each day to the full while I can and be grateful that I am alive. SaxxyD - I am sure your scans will be fine - we worry about every ache and pain I know but you are a brave, strong lovely lady and you have been through loads and always come out the other side OK xxx Shelley - I think Caroline is right - one thing I did while waiting for my initial results was to use a technique where you parcel you worry into a little box under the bed and leave it there each night. It seemed to work for me as it was just like taking the thoughts out of my brain and putting them in a box and all the worry went away so I could sleep. It may not help but it's worth a try.

      "Content": "Hi Kelly, I had a mastectomy and node clearance at the end of April and found that the first part is almost the hardest as it's the constant trips to the hospital, the huge aount of information you have to take in and the constant worry. Things do settle down once your treatment plan is confirmed, but you just have to take one day at a time and not worry about things which may never happen in the future. If you can talk your anxieties through with someone that often helps. I used a qualified life coach who coaches sports people but also people with illness. This put things into perspective and made me realise that a lot I was worrying about was unfounded and just me being anxious. The hospital also offered an appointment with a clinical phsycologist but there was a waiting list. I also looked on the internet a lot for alternative therapies, diets etc. anything which may help (not at success rates, prognosis or anything scary like that). If nothing else, it made me feel proactive and more in control Being told you have cancer when you didn't suspect it and feel 100% well is a massive shock to the system and takes a long time to come to terms with. I was angry for ages and couldn't cry at all so there is no normal way to react - we are all individuals and our cancer is too.

At least by having an ultrasound, presumably they can tell for sure what it is. Try not to worry about things in the future as they may never happen. Sorry I can't be of more help, but one thing I have realised with this cancer rubbish is that it is almost 95% mental and 5% physical in a strange sort of way. If you can get your head clear and not let the worrying thoughts creep in, it seems to help somehow. Not easy I know but good luck - I am thinking of you and wishing you the very best. Big hugs.
