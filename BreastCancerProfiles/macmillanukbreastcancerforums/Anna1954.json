    "Content": "Hi everyone I went to the doctors over a year ago with a lump in my right  breast and the doctor just dismissed it and implied it was in my head. He just asked if i knew anyone that had just been diagnosed woth breast cancer. Anyway my back and side started hurting and i have ringing in my ears and just general achiness.  So i went back and the doctor found the lump i had all the time without me telling him where it was. So now i have my appointment tuesday at the breasy clinic. I am worried because it had been there so long at least 14 months and now im thinking it this is cancer im screwed. I am 31 and a nursing student and dont really have anyone close to come with me.",
