      "Content": "Hi Hopefully you have the photos I sent and I've not put you off. If you're not squeamish, I recommend watching the Surgeons; at the edge of life programme on BBC2. The first one showed a lady having diep recomstruction. If you've not seen it, it should be on iplayer. I found it fascinating and I think she got a better result than me as she had the mx and recon at the same time. If you want any more photos or info, ask away. Hazel x",

      "Content": "Hi Violet25 I had a bilateral mastectomy back in 2015. I delayed recon as I didn't know if I wanted it but then had diep recon in 2016. I was a DD before but ended up probably between an A and a B. I was actually not unhappy about that as I'm very small and DD was rather large for me. I've not worn a proper bra since my WLE back in 2014. I tend to just wear the soft bra tops or just a vest. I haven't even had a fitting after the recon so I'm not sure what size I've ended up. I'd be happy to send you a picture. Hazel x",
