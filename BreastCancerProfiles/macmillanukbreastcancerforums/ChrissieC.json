Lucky for her if she did as she would have woken up with a 'breast' again. Not every lady gets that because of further treatment which is needed. Some of us wake up from the op to find it all gone, totally flat as a pancake and that is tough. If she needs chemo then I don't think that she will find that so easy. If she keeps doing a blog then I just hope that she thinks a bit more before she opens her mouth or writes it down.  The treatment is very hard and we do it because we have to for a chance to stay alive. Sorry for the rant.",

It is extremely cold and helps to close down the capillaries to the hair follicles thus stopping the chemo reaching them.  I will say that when they put it on you feel you will not cope with it but honestly after a hard ten minutes your body does  get used to it and I have managed to use it for my three FEC chemos. I have lost some hair on the top of my head and around the sides but probably still have 60% of my hair.  I do wear a hat or a scarf when outside as the sun would burn my scalp otherwise! I bought some headgear from Seasalt, Buff and my hospital's cancer centre plus a huge sun hat! You must be in complete shock at the moment but we are all here for you. Lots of love and luck xxx",

Isn't it annoying that you feel good just before they do it all again, but you are nearly finished! Tamoxifen and Herceptin are different.  If your cancer cells have oestrogen receptors then you would be prescribed Tamoxifen as this will block any rogue cancer cells taking up oestrogen and using it to multiply. If you have high levels of HER2 receptors on your cancer cells then you will be prescribed Herceptin.  This will help to block the effect of this receptor and encourage your own immune system to kill any abnormal cells. The NHS choices site is good for this. Hope that helps. Love xxx",

I still have about 70% of my hair at the moment but will see what happens after this T chemo. It will be a good break for you to have a holiday after the chemo and best of luck for the op. They told me to think about a recon after all of the chemo and rads is over.  I am a bit older than most of you ladies so not sure whether I even want another op, we shall see how I feel after Christmas. I cannot believe that we have all been here since April and it is July tomorrow! Time is moving on and we are all getting through this, well done everybody. xxxx",

I have been making the most of my good week before my last chemo and got to day 1 of The Ashes at Trent Bridge! What a brilliant day out that was. Also bought a newer car and out for hubby's birthday on Sunday.    xxx",
