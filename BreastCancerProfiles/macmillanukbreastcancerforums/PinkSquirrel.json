Ventolin will give more immediate results though if you're wheezy. As mentioned above, remember to rinse out your mouth after using your inhalers as they can cause oral thrush. Alternatively, try breathing in the steam from a boiled kettle or bowl of boiled water with the bonus of a facial at the same time! Hope you're less wheezy soon! PinkSquirrel ",

I took a leave of absence from work during chemo and my HR department asked for a continuous fit for work note to ensure that I was paid during my absence. My GP issued fit for work notes every 3 months with conditions stated as to what I could and couldn't do. A longer fit for work note will also give you some protection if your employer has unreasonable expectations as to what you're able to do.",

Take something with a faster beat but nothing that will make you want to shoulder dance or move to the music! If you've got longer hair, tie it back to avoid it annoying you when you can't move. Try wearing an eye mask to distract you from where you are and perhaps help you fall asleep. Ask if you're allowed to have someone with you during the scan that can talk to you and keep you calm. If they're going to use a contrast dye during your MRI, ensure that you've drunk plenty of fluids beforehand to plump up your veins to make the cannula insertion easier. Just remember to visit the loo beforehand as you don't want to be stuck in the MRI machine desperate to pee! : ) The nurses will be able to see and hear you in the MRI machine via a camera and you'll have a panic button in your hand if you need to be removed from the machine if you feel claustrophobic.

My chemo team advised eating small, regular meals to fuel my body. Your body is expending energy to process the chemo drugs so you need to provide your body with additional energy to keep you going. If food stood still long enough during my first chemo, it was mine but I didn't stock my cupboards to the same extent for the subsequent chemos and therefore didn't over eat to the same extent. I too have a layer of insulation that I could stand to lose but I was more focused on getting my body through chemo than trying to lose the weight. Everybody reacts differently to chemo and whilst you may experience adverse side effects, you might also be lucky and experience very few side effects. I would suggest trying your first chemo with food and see how you get on. If you struggle with side effects and medication doesn't help you, then perhaps look at alternative ways of minimising the side effects.",

I took diazepam beforehand and got as far as going into the machine but I couldn't stay still and I didn't even get as far as the machine being turned on. Thankfully the diazepam chilled me out enough that I didn't have a panic attack this time. Apparently they can't knock you out for a breast scan (possibly as you're face down) and I couldn't go in feet first as I wouldn't have been far enough into the machine for the scan. I tried stretching my arms out in front of me with my forehead resting on my arms but I couldn't get comfy enough to stay still. My lumpectomy went ahead on thursday as planned without the benefit of the MRI scan. My surgeon has warned me that I might need a further operation to ensure all of the cells are removed. I'm hoping I don't need any further MRI scans but if I do, I'll attempt them on a much stronger dose of diazepam!",

I was more worried about feeling claustrophobic and panicking during the MRI than I am about the lumpectomy and the afterwards. I couldn't keep still during the 4 minute scan so wasn't going to manage the 20 minute scan and the scan was stopped. Then I had a mild panic attach which wasn't fun. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to get a sedative to knock me out a little and attempt the MRI again at a later date. Unfortunately I have to wait two weeks for another MRI appointment which means two weeks of worry that the same thing will happen again. I'm disappointed in myself that I couldn't get through the MRI as it is being done for my benefit. The biopsies didn't faze me but a big magnet made me cry! Has anyone had surgery without the benefit of the MRI? I went into the machine head first and it wasn't the confined space that bothered me as much as having my face surrounded in the hole on the table and not being able to move. It didn't help that I overheated despite the fan being on the maximum setting (possibly part of the panic attack or a hot flush) and couldn't cool down. Is it possible to do the MRI leaning my chin on the table or to the side or resting on my arms so I don't feel so enclosed? Does anyone have any tips or positions to help get through a breast MRI? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!",

Be careful if you have any dairy allergies as both creams contain milk proteins.

I have 2 small lumps (6mm and 18mm) and I'm scheduled for a lumpectomy at the start of September followed by radiotherapy and 10 years of tamoxifen. I initially thought I would have the lumpectomy, get through the radiotherapy and get back to my life but from researching breast cancer it is starting to dawn on me how much my life changed last week. I'm hoping to return to work after I've recovered from the lumpectomy and hopefully work part-time while I receive the radiotherapy but I'm not sure if I'm being naive hoping to still go to work through this. I'm trying to stay positive - I'm 41 so I'm classed as \"young\" and my surgeon (who looks like Prince Harry) said he might fill the dent from the lumpectomy with a little fat from my stomach... free liposuction! Although I'm putting on a brave face, like you, I'm very scared. I have so many questions about what is happening, what is going to happen and what the future holds. I feel like I'm about to sit an exam without knowing anything about the subject.

I suspect Genesis is more expensive as few pharmacies seem to stock it whereas Wockhardt, Teva and Mylan are readily available. If your preferred brand is not one of these brands, I would suggest befriending your local independent pharmacist (ie. not Boots / Alliance Healthcare) as they will have access to more suppliers and hence more opportunity to source your preferred brand.",
