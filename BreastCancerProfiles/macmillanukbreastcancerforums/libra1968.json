      "Content": "slightly different but the insensitivity is the same. im in hospital and the theres a woman around my age in next bed. started chatting to her hubby and he tells me she has secondries in various places. i sympathise and he asks what i have. i explained i have early breast cancer and he replies \"OH YEAH THATS HOW MY WIFE STARTED\" what the actual ****?? say nothing pal because i really didnt need to hear that!!! im sure that he didnt mean it but when he walked away i broke my heart crying. id never considered it might spread till that point. i was convinced the docs would sort me out and that would be that. i may be naive but i liked that happy place. ive been worrying ever since.Â ",
