    "Content": "Hi Holly I am also new to the site and have had a similar news to youself. It came as a massive blow and i was scared as hell but mum was calm and seemed to be the strong one. Im not sure i am the best person to help or give advice but ill try to explain how i have been dealing with mums illness and its impact. My Mum was diagnosed on the 13th march 2008 as terminal. Like you i felt helpless and lost, wondering what i could do to be the best support i could be to mum and to dad. This site and the people here will give you the best love and support you could find. Personally as the weeks and now into months have past i have become more comfortable about how to support other family members as well as my mum. Each day is different and we cant expect what worked the day before to work tomorrow. Take your mum as you find her if she is up then be up with her , if she is down sick tired or angry, have a listening ear. Dont try too hard to make all things right, thats impossible. Your mum through how she acts, or what she says will be your guide as to what she needs you to be at that time. She my want to speak (then talk openly) may want to cry (Draw close and tell her your there for her), my want to ignore or deny it (allow her this space), all we can do is be there. We dont have all the answers but by allowing ourselves to feel free around our loved ones who are suffering, the light of our love will shine through to them. From this they receive our support. Hope this helps in some small way. my thoughts are with you. jim",
