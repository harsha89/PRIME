Mine hadn't spread to my lymph nodes and I started Chemotherapy at the end of January, the only thing that worried me was losing my hair. I stayed positive all the way through as they say on tv more people survive cancer than die from it. I have since had my lumpectomy which after chemo the tumour was greatly reduced. I should have the results of the biopsy in a couple of weeks, but I feel confident that they got it all out. I think my next step is radiotherapy, but after chemo I feel I can handle anything. Just stay strong and just follow the consultant/doctors advice. Just remember to listen to your body and if it says take it easy do so. Oh I also told all my friends as soon as I could as I wanted them to treat me no differently from normal. I was determined it wasn't going to beat me, so I didn't let it get me down. This is a brilliant site and the people on here are lovely and as they are either going through the same as you or have they are the best to talk to. Don't be afraid to ask anything, no matter how stupid it may sound. Mo  ",

I went to my local Maggie's Centre which is lovely anyway There were 9 people there and nearly as many people there to help us. We were each given a goody bag based on our skin colouring. I was the only person there who was currently undergoing treatment, some of them had their treatment years ago which surprised me. In the goody back there was make-up remover, cleanser, toner, moisturiser, colour corrector, foundation, concealer,eyeshadow,eyeliner, eyebrow pencil, mascara, 2 lipsticks, lip balm lip liner, face powder, blushed, a brush for putting on eyeshadow and a 50ml bottle of perfume. All from various counters in Boots.  We had a good laugh putting on the makeup, they would demonstrate on someone how to do it then we got a go.  The other plus side of the night was one of the girls who was helping used to work with me and I haven't seen her for years so we had a bit of a catch up. Went for my bloods today and the ontology nurse said I might be a bit aneamic, so she took an extra thing of blood to check, so might not get chemo on Friday. As I have been really tired and breathless this week. But I also have had high colour and stretching a lot, so she said that could be an allergy and has put me on anti histamines to see if that helps. She said she will phone me tomorrow. How have you coped with the reduced dose this time? Mo xx",

That is not good that the reduced dose hasn't made a difference. I haven't suffered from aching joints at all, might be all my natural padding, lol. I was feeling ok till this week. I have been told I am not anaemia so getting my chemo as normal tomorrow. Will be glad to see the back of it, hopefully will start to pick after it. That will be nice to get some time away, hopefully you will get good weather. Good idea to stay in a guest house as I find if you stay with friends or family you are tempted to help them do things at least in a guest house you will be waived on and can walk away and leave the washing up to someone else. I could go and stay with my friend in Inverness but she likes her drink too much and don't think I could cope. Mum is too busy for me to stay there. So just hope we get good weather here so I can just go and sit in the sun, getting sick of the rain now. Mo Xx",

      "Content": "As you know from my previous post I start my Chemotherapy on Friday. So I started on Monday by burning my hand with hot soup so ended up in A&E. Tuesday I had my pre chemotherapy chat and did bloods, but they seemed ok about burnt hand. Wednesday I was back up at hospital to get Coil marker fitted and to get a bone scan. While in getting coil marker fitted the staff nurse grilled me about my burn and it turned out she used to be a burns nurse. She wasn't happy about my dressing and sent me back to A&E to get it redressed to her instructions. So I was at the hospital for nearly the whole day. And now to top it all my period started today. If I wasn't a strong person I would probably cry, but do want to scream, aargh!!!!",

I am also hoping I might get a drink as well. My step dad is doing well although my mum had a meeting with the hospital on Friday as she was worried he wasn't getting enough mental stimulation. They admitted that they didn't know he was a stroke patient and just thought he was there to recuperate. They have now put a plan in place. You need to tell your parents that you are unable to help them and for once you are going to be selfish and tell them they need to accept help as you are unable to help them and they are causing you distress, put yourself first. I am the opposite my mum offers help but I am too stubborn and independent. One thing I have learnt from this is to put myself first and to be a bit selfish and say no. Love and hugs to you too.

I try to keep to a routine going to bed about the same time and getting up about the same time. The nurses are all lovely at the chemo ward and most people are friendly as we are all on the same mission to beat this thing. If you think you are not well or not sure of anything health wise in between don't be afraid to call the chemo line as they are helpful. I had a swollen gland and spent an afternoon in hospital, where they did every test possible before sending me home with antibiotics I am thinking of you. Mo xx",

I have to wait for the district nurse to come and give me an injection to boost my blood count, this is because of my hospital visit, but it will maybe make the next 3 weeks better. I expected all horrors of symptoms when I had my first, but apart from the fatigue I was ok. Just take it easy for the first 2 days and listen to your body. Mo. xx",

Unfortunately due to a downturn in the oil industry at the moment there are not that many jobs around, so might take a bit of time to get anything.  Just have to hope my lottery numbers come up in the meantime, I can see myself sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere.....",

It feels like I have never been away from the hospital since December, but I have finally beat it and can officially become a NEDDY.  Only downside is I now need to look for a job, could have got used to being a lady of leisure.  Mo Xx",

A Neddy is when you have no evidence of disease and have been discharged, until your next check up. I don't have to go back till January. Mo xx",

Don't be afraid to rant on here, and I am sure if you told your family and friends how you really feel they will be fine with it. They are there as support as are we. I have also been on antibiotic, but only was in hospital for an afternoon while they did tests. I am also losing my hair, I am scared to brush my hair, even though I have prepared myself to lose my hair it is still hard.  I just always like to think that there is someone worse off than me out there and I will get through this and come out the other side ok. It is hard to always think like that especially if you are feeling unwell. Big hug from me Take care Mo xx",
