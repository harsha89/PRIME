      "Content": "Evening Dreamthief, Thank you for responding with so much information.   I am having my 4th cycle of Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide tomorrow.  Then cycles 5 to 8 are Docetaxel and Pertuzumab and 18 cycles of Herceptin (which is an injection).  I was expecting I may loose my toenails with the Doxetaxel on cycles 5 to 8 but was quite shocked when after cycle 3 my finger nails started to turn black.  My toes are fine at the moment. A big thank you again for all the other helpful advice. Take care, Ann156.x",
