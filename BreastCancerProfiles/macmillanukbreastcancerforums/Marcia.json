    "Content": "Hi Kelly, how's it going? I've just had my 4th chemo (1st docetaxel - previous ones were EC) and not had any signs and symptoms yet apart from a line across my nails I just noticed. I'm taking acetyl l carnitine to prevent the numbness (neuropathy) which was recommended by several people and also via a bit of research which is underway - thought it was worth a punt - http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00775645  Other than that nothing yet but it's only day 2... Would be really glad to know how you've got on over the last few weeks By the way - I take 3000mg per day of the aceytl l carnitine (that's the recommended dose for this stuff but way higher than the stated dose on the pack - I checked with my oncologist who was fine with it - it's essentially just amino acids / anti oxidant). I order it online to get it cheaper - it cost around £60 for a whole 4 months supply. Don't get l carnitine (that's what body builders use) it's got to be the acetyl stuff. ",
