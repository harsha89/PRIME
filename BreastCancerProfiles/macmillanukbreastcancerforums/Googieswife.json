      "Content": "Thanks Staffy. So glad the bcn called you. Good luck with the wig finding. I have also looked at the wig bank. Don't know if there is one near you. I got the info from the Internet. At the moment going to sort out a wig seems a lot of effort lol. May just stick to hats etc. I had a mascetomy so don't know if I will be able to drive myself that far for chemo. Plus not knowing how I will feel. I may be ok but will wait and see.  Have you been on the look good feel good course? I am waiting for a call back about it, to see if I can get in before chemo. I was given good advice by a nurse to get everything done before chemo starts, so concentrating on what I can do at the moment. Take care sweet xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Staffy I got my £60 voucher at my appointment to get results and to meet the oncologist. I am waiting to start chemo which I think I have another couple of weeks.  I know all hospitals are different and you will probably find you get more money for your wig. Could you not ring the clinic to get the voucher?  I have to travel about a 60/70 mile round trip for treatment. Having to rely on family and friends to take me.  Sorry I can't be more help but I am sure someone will be along soon that knows more. Good luck Vicky x",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your replies.  I had the blue dye injected in the nipple this afternoon and didn't feel a thing! Since then I have been calmer. It seems to make it easier talking about it. I am lucky as I have my family and a good network of friends. I spoke to the Macmillian nurse this morning and she explained why they don't do pre meds anymore. From what I got from my pre assessment I am the only one on the theatre list and wouldn't have time anyway! I have since found out there is building work going on and a lot of ops and procedures have been postponed. I don't mind looking at a few builders working   As soon as I am back home I will fill you all in on how it went. This is the only site I have been on as I didn't want any false information. Thanks again and I hope you are all feeling well xxxx",

Very reassuring and a member of the team asked me if they could do a case study on me, which I did not mind. She was with me beginning to end and also came to see me after. I am now home shattered but struggling to sleep! We know the cancer is in some of the lymph nodes, but will find out more at my appointment. Thank you to you all that responded you did help put my mind at rest xx",

I went to the Drs for something different and she asked if I had pain in my chest, which I didn't but had one boob seeing how quick it could reach my belly button! From there I was referred to the breast clinic and in between the 2 week wait I found a lump. Tomorrow is my mastectomy. I am scared. I have never had an operation or even broken a bone before. Just waiting for my dad to pick me up to go and have the blue dye injection in my nipple - ouch!  Any tips or advice I would be extremely grateful xxx",

Dcis with foci of invasive cancer. One tumour had an er score of 4/8 and her2 positive. The second tumour they were still waiting for more results.  I started Fec chemo a couple of weeks ago. Today I got the letter they have finally sent to the gp. The second tumour is triple negative.  I know I will be having rads and herceptin.  Is any of this going to treat the triple negative? No family history of bc, my dad has low grade prostate cancer. Any advice I would be so grateful as I am now feeling less positive.  Thanks  Vicky x",
