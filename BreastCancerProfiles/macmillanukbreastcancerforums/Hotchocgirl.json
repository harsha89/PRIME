    "Content": "Hi Kaz I had a right mastectomy in dec10 and have just been given reconstruction surgery date of May, I took a fall and have injured my shoulder on this side start physio tomorrow (thank god) I have been so stiff and uncomfortable with this is worse than the mastectomy recovery I am having both reconstructed as I look deformed with out a bra on did you only have one side done? I could not have the choice of a lumpectomy as I am quite small and they said there would not be anything left to save after a lumpectomy It is nice to have a choice but the surgeon is the only one that knows on the individual case I feel very confidant with mine that she is doing the best job possible for me",
