      "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy for idc nearly 3 weeks ago, I have been told I need further surgery as the margins weren't clear, which is fine. But they also told me 1 out of the 2 lymph nodes they removed was also cancerous. My dilemma is, do I go for the total removal of the nodes whilst I'm under the knife, or just go for radiotherapy??? I will be meeting the oncologist soon to discuss this, but it keeps going over and over in my mind what I should do. Has anyone else been in a similar situation that could offer some advice please. I would much prefer it to say this is the best course of action, you need to do this ......, it's actually driving me crazy!!",

      "Content": "Thank you for all your replies, it's so good (in a weird sort of way) that other people are going through the same thing as you. I will be seeing my oncologist on Mon, so will be able to discuss my options, but I am veering towards the full clearance of the nodes, as jintyb said, better to get all the b####rs out, and get rid!!!! Thanks for your kind words, I feel like I'm on a roller coaster I can't get off at the moment, but we will all get there, and be all singing and dancing soon !!!!! Can't wait!!",

      "Content": "Thank you jintyb, and congratulations on being cancer free, I fully understand that feeling of wanting to be alone , you really do need that time for reflection. Well, having had my appointment with the oncologist today, he explained that the type of cancer Â I have being type 2, and what was found in one of the two lymph nodes which was micrometatasis ( I think that's what he called it may of got the spelling wrong) that basically clearance of the lymph nodes wouldn't benefit me in any way, and the risks of surgery and lymphoedema far out weigh leaving them in. When I asked what he would do, he said if it was his wife, he would recommend not having them removed. So he swayed my thinking not to have the surgery. However, in my mind, a little part of me is saying get rid of them, I hate that I cannot make up my mind!!! What a quandary, any advice ladies would be greatly appreciated........",
