      "Content": "Hi Lou, I would take it that you had a high temp of over 37, then presented yourself at Hosp. They would assume you were neutreprenic, so you get the broadband Abx IV style. As you are probably aware chemo reduces your bodies immunity, please bear in mind there are many reasons why your temp may have shot up, not all will show on standard tests. Because you have been admitted they need to make sure that you are fit and healthy again, before they recommence effectively shooting your immune system again. I know it is frustrating when everything stops, happened to me and to Den. But they do need to play safe. What you will probably find is that after seeing your Onc you will continue, running a week behind schedule, so you will not lose any treatment, it will just be a week later. Hope this helps. You could also try calling the Mac helpine, if you need to chat to somebody. Regards Xxxx",
