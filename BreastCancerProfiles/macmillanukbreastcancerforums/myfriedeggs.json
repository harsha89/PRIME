    "Content": "HER2 and Oestrogen positive breast cancer I have two surgeries for a lumpectomy last July 2017 and additional margin removal August 2017, then 6 Chemo treatments (3 x FEC - 3 x T), alongside the Herception 4/18 so far, and am on day six of 15 radiotherapy treatments.  I have been given Tamoxifen to take, but after reading the amount of possible side effects am unsure of taking them.  Has anyone got any advice.  I realise everyone is different, but perhaps I just need a bit of reassurance on the product before taking it.
