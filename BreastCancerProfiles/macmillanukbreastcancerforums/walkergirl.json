      "Content": "Hi Caz I hope your appointment goes well tomorrow and you get the answers and treatment plan you want. I get my Onco score tomorrow from the Oncologist - face to face (did try and get the result over the phone but no luck) and still not sure what I will do if I get the grey area result, like you have been reading everything but at the end of the day I guess we need the advice of the Oncologist into account as well as the result, Good luck for tomorrow. x",

I\u2019ve just had to ask my mum to leave as I wanted some time on my own for a bit (she seems to think she needs to be here 24/7 so I\u2019ve just explained I need some me time it probably sounded ungrateful but I am off to the hospital in a little while hopefully they can take out my drain and the results will be in for my next steps. ",

Radiotherapy is not an option as I have has a mastectomy with clear margins so they won\u2019t offer this for me so chemo seems to be the next step for me - so now waiting for oncology.  Gutted it\u2019s shown up in the lymph node",
