Now I've just had some results that I'm on boarder line to have chemo which is rather a set back as all through my pre operation discussions with my surgeon I was told I would not need chemo hey ho ! , ",

      "Content": "It's day 5 of EC chemo X1 for me and I can certainly emphasis with you all !  It is a journey  , the  main thing that I keep in my mind to get through all this is by session 2  I will be half way .  Just finished three days of 4 different anti sickness tablets  , that I think actually made me feel worse  , however I did not vomit so wondering what to take after 2nd session . Suffering from horrid metallic taste .  Just washed hair very carefully and then had to walk the streets for ages , as was told not to use a hair dryer ! Trying cold cap so aiming to follow recommendations .  Thanks for support and I would love to join the beach party although I'm in London . Lets keep strong together xx     ",

      "Content": "Act on everyone's  good advice and thoughts Kabee you have been through a lot and as time goes on you wil feel stronger and hopefully be able to sleep more which is so important . Take care and good luck with your recovery xx  Fifi my story is so similar to yours I was diagnosed with DCIS in May this year ,  but luckily I made the decision to have a mastectomy with thigh flap reconstruction  , as post operation my results showed that my stage 1 initial diagnosis of DCIS was in fact not that accurate ! ! I remember letting out a woop of oh yes I made the right decision during that meeting with my surgeon as she had really quizzed me about why I had come to my decision about having a mastectomy . I had luckily met a few great women in the few week pre operation who  had told me about experiences and said not to mess about just go straight for a full mastectomy as they had had to have another operation later . I got through my surgery well even surprised myself as it was my first operation  and first stay in hospital ever , hopefully the last too , recovered well apart from some infection on my thigh stitches .  Compared to the operation chemo is certainly tough I've just had session 2  , using the cold cap as loosing my hair seems to be a big issue !! And I will try anything to try and keep it , feeling nauseous on 4 different kinds of anti sickness tablets for 3days again persevering with them as I wasn't actually sick last time however I felt so much better when I stopped taking them and went on my natural ginger tablets . Also had chronic stomach pains a few days after the tablets so keeping fingers crossed that won't happen this time .  As you said  I'm feeling a little low  now ,  but thinking of the pattern of post the last session , about 3 to 4 days resting and feeling rough then the next week a bit better , I had a few headaches and luckily only one migraine , then at the beginning of post week three I felt that cloud lift in my head and felt relatively back to normal enjoying it by having some treats even drove a long way to get some lovely sea air and a great walk along the sand !   All in preparation for the next onslaught of chemo but celebrating that I'm half way and on the count down yippee !  My hair seems to be malting already after this 2 nd session  , although trying to keep positive as no big chunks so far not combing it much  aaaaahhh and the wig lady unfortunately had to cancel my appointment this week due to her illness .  Take care everyone and pamper yourself we can get through all this together  sending everyone very good positive  vibes Angella xxx  ",

We need to let it all out !  I was told to wear the stockings for two weeks then after that to wear them at night or when at home resting during the day but not when out and about walking .etc .  I was told the stockings would become my friends however this hasn't been the case they are soooooo restricting & tight especially as I'm also wearing compression shorts & a bra both day & night . I live for the break I give myself from all this restriction for about half an hour each morning and evening .  Keep strong & positive focus on coming through all this xx   ",
