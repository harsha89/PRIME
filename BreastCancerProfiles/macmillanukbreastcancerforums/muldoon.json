    "Content": "HI all, Im 54 diagnosed in December 2017 as positive breast cancer...it was 20mm with some smaller patches and 3 out of 12 lymph nodes showed positive after mastectomy and Node removal. Her2 +...I had previously been diagnosed with calcifications in 2014 but never went to the follow ups...didnt think it was important. I had my surgery 3 days before xmas...slept through to New year....was meant to start chemo in january then have radiotherapy and 10 years of letrozole...but I had a chest infection as I am chronic asthmatic. chemo postponed......then in February I was ill again so chemo was postponed again...during this time I read up all I could and I decided with my already weakened lung condition that I didnt want to do chemo..so I declined and wentÂ  straight to Radiotherapy..17 cycles over 3 weeks..which was alright, slight fatigue....finished five weeks ago...On the Letrozole now....fair bit of weight around the middle but no real side effects. Guess Im tryna ask the rough prognosis with how I have approached he treatments, Have I majorly handicapped my chances or was it the right thing? I think Im stage 3 grade 2....not absolute certain on the grade. Anyone had any experience similar?",
