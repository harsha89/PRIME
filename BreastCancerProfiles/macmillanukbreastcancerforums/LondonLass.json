I had issues a while ago and reached breaking point, I couldn't contact anyone and so blurted all my issues out to them. Within a day or two they had information, I had an email from surgeon a call from the nurse and a lot of apologies! But it got the ball rolling and made me feel they were doing something and I hadn't been forgotten. I don't understand the need for another biopsy? If they already know it's cancer? Surely they are going to operate so why more biopsies! Think I would be asking more questions...through pals! Hope that helps a little, or at least makes you feel someone is listening. Pick up that phone Hun and get some answers.  Good luck xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Pootlecav, I'm really sorry to hear how low you are feeling. I think my first piece of advice would be to go back to your GP and explain how you are really feeling. its not really for your GP to tell you when you are ready to return to work. Yes they can say if you are physically ready, although even that can vary from person to person. But they certainly can't tell if you are emotionally ready, only you know that. Are you going back to a phased return? What sort of work do you do? If it's something you really don't enjoy, maybe it's time to find a new job, for a fresh start! I know even that can feel very daunting! I think you need to decide whether you really don't feel up to going back or if it's just because you are scared you are going back to your old life that you weren't enjoying! Sometimes we have to face our fears to give us the push we need to make life changing decisions. Maybe when you go back you will find ways to improve the way you feel about your job, or maybe it will give you the push/drive to find something new. Sorry if that doesn't help much, I have always been lucky enough to do a job i love! So for me the bigger fear was the fear I would never work in the same role again. We are all different and we all have different ways of looking at things. You have to find a solution to suit you a solution that makes you happy. After all you have been through its time to LIVE not just to EXIST! I want to offer you a ((((((((((supportive hug)))))))))) We may not be able to solve your problems but everyone on here is here to support you and offer a shoulder to cry on. We all have bad days/weeks/months but you will get through them and you will find that positive, happy life you yearn for. Why else would you of just fought the biggest fight of your life! Xxxxx",

I recall having that feeling of something being stuck in my arm pit, a very odd sensation, but it does eventually go. Keep going with the exercises as they really do help. As for Lymphoedema just keep an eye. I would say it's unlikely as it 'usually' affects the arm or breast. I have Lymphoedema in both arm and breast but interestingly the shoulder isn't affected! I would give it a few more weeks and see how it goes, keep an eye on your arm, if you want to be super vigilant you could record some measurements now and check again in a few weeks! That way IF you were still concerned you would have something to show them! I hope it is just swelling from the surgery, it takes time for everything to get back to normal. I know I had odd feelings and sensations for months. But it will settle eventually. Hope that helps a little (((((((((hug)))))))) xxx",

Saw the above comment and sorry I couldn't ignore! Has this Physio had breast cancer? Has she actually taken the drug herself?  I took it for 18months and for me, and of course we are all different, the Tamoxifen caused the lack of sleep and the low mood! How do I know? Because when I stopped taking it, just 3 days later my mood lifted, I went from feeling like my life wasn't worth living to the happy person I used to be, bearing in mind I had also just found out my Cancer had spread to the bone, I had every reason to feel down but I didn't. After 18months of feeling rubbish I felt human again! I'm not saying Tamoxifen is horrible for everyone in fact most people get on fine with it, but for some people, like me the Drug did cause these issues, it wasn't the sleep deprivation!  I am still NOT sleeping properly but my mood on the whole is fine. On Tamoxifen I was awful. Hope I haven't spoken out of turn. But I got really frustrated by hearing things like that being said to me by my GP or BCN or Oncologist.........I felt I was going mad because no one seemed to agree it was the drug causing this!  As I said we are all different and I hope you sail through with minimal issues  xxx As for work, WORRIED2016 and ronstar I wouldn't rush into anything. If you are able to delay things, I would consider that. Or maybe try part time?! If that is possible. Sending love to you both xx",

Some of it was spent getting over surgery, the rest of it I just relaxed and took it easy!  I started back at work, a new job on Tuesday this week and it was tough but it was very enjoyable to be back to 'my new normal'!  I think you need to work out if you need to work, what sort of work you would like, and then start with minimal hours and work your way up slowly As for Cancer affecting your chances of getting a job.....in some places sadly it will. But other places will hire you, because you are able to do the job! The perfect job will be out there, when you are ready for it!

You need to decide whether it's worth the discomfort for the next 5 sessions, or whether you can get your head around the idea of losing your hair! Although I will add, others don't need to see you bald....there are some amazing wigs around and so there's no reason why you shouldn't still appear perfectly 'normal' around others! I decided against cold capping, because I couldn't face the extended time in the chemo unit and the thought of having to be extra careful with my hair during those 18wks was just too much for me! Dealing with the chemo was enough! I went from waist length hair to bald in a couple of weeks  Yes I cried and felt self conscious for a bit, then I brushed myself off and realised that in the whole scheme of things, hair wasn't that big a deal after all, plus it would and has grown back! It's a very personal decision, but I hope you make one that leaves you able to get through the next few weeks without any added stress. Sending you a (((((((((supportive hug)))))))) xxxx",

When I was told I could stop the Tamoxifen the oncologist said don't expect too much too soon, it'll take a while to get the drug out of your system......by day 3 I felt like 'me' again! I felt I had been released from a sort of living nightmare, back in to my old life! That drug may be doing a great job at keeping Cancer away (not for me) but it can affect your body in a huge way, it's only when you stop it that you realise what it was truly doing! I am on Zoladex injections now, which sadly have put me back in that horrid place, but it's not quite as bad as the Tamoxifen. I have no choice about taking this drug as I now have secondaries.  It's really difficult to start taking a drug again, when you know how you felt without it. All you can do is remind yourself of what it's hopefully doing! You do have a choice, but obviously it comes with risks and you need to think how you would cope if you stopped the tablets and the cancer came back.....could you cope with that or would you blame yourself!! Good Luck with whatever you decide! ((((((((((Understanding hug))))))))))) xxx",

      "Content": "yesterday I finally faced the fact that I have Secondary Breast Cancer and that it will always be with me. So however much I TRY to continue on and pretend it's not there, it is, and it always will be! I have believed all along that the best way to fight this disease was to pretend it wasn't really happening. To continue on as normal. Yesterday was different, I woke after a rough night feeling exhausted. I HAD to lift my heavy legs out of bed as I had to go to work! I wanted to go to work, but a part of me just felt it was too much effort. After I was dressed and I stood in the kitchen counting out my drugs for the morning, I cried.......cried because I felt so tired and so fed up, that at just 41 (okay almost 42) I was stood there first thing in the morning feeling absolutely exhausted. However at the same time wanting to go to work, to do the job I am good at and that I love! It was at that point I realised, I wasn't the same person anymore, I wasn't a fit and healthy 41year old, I was a 41 year old, who was just getting over a chest infection, just starting a new job after 1 year off, living with pain everyday, coping with hot flushes, lack of sleep, mood swings, Lymphoedema and the BIG one......the one I have ignored for so long......most of this caused by drugs that I HAVE to take to keep my Cancer under control! However annoying they are they are hopefully going to keep me alive for a long time, but the pay off is, I have to remember I do have Cancer and I can't be as physically or emotionally strong as I used to be!  This is the new me, and according to my new boss I'm still pretty darn good at my job! We had a good chat, and I now feel relaxed and calm about things........for the first time in 3.5years!  So my reason for writing this, well I like to assume that I'm not the only person who has struggled to TRULY admit what has or is happening to them! So maybe someone else will read this and allow themselves to change the way they think about themselves. We are surrounded by people telling us \"how brave we are\", \"how strong we are\" etc etc when I personally just needed to tell myself that this journey isn't about being strong or brave, it's about being HONEST about admitting that the new you, won't ever be exactly like the old you, and that that's okay! Because in some ways the new you is BETTER, WISER and definitely more CARING and UNDERSTANDING than the old you, ever was! It might be physically worse off, in some cases, but you know what, that's okay too.......just do what you can from day to day, after all as my grandmother always said \"there's another day tomorrow\"!  So now I intend to wear my heart on my sleeve, I will admit to myself that I'm not superhuman, I will ask for support when I need it, I will speak out when I need help! Because I am very much 'living with Cancer' and other people need to understand how hard that is sometimes! It's nothing to be ashamed of it's nothing to hide, in fact maybe if we spoke more openly about Cancer it wouldn't continue to scare people the way it seems to at the moment! My boss was very open to hearing how I felt and I'm sure there are many more people like her. I don't want tilted heads and the sympathetic looks, but at the same time if we actually admit we are living and working with Cancer, we show others that we are still very much alive and well! If that makes sense!!  Now I should really think about getting up! Time to enjoy my lazy weekend! Hope you all have a good one",

As a rule the staff were amazing, but on one occasion they had some 'manager' in who needed to check how they were doing things! I had already been lined up, but she needed to check everything and redo it. I was lying half naked for 45mins, with 6 people in the room (male and female). I wasn't asked if this was okay and couldn't say anything as I had a tube in my mouth as I was using a breath hold technique. I had a lot to say afterwards and made it very clear that this was not how patients should be treated! The manager was VERY apologetic, but it was too little too late! I still got through my 35 sessions! Even managed a laugh on some of the days. So please don't lose heart. Tell them how hard today was and how upset you were.

      "Content": "Hi Hun, sounds like you need another appointment with your surgeon, for him/her to explain things properly! Your results were good, you had no node involvement which is a good sign. It means it's highly likely the cancer was contained within the breast. Which obviously is no longer there. Whoch is why they haven't offered Chemo.  As for IF it comes back would it be incurable......NO it wouldn't necessarily become incurable. It could return in the other breast which would be classed as another primary and treated in that way. It would still be curable if it was contained to the breast or breast and nodes.

      "Content": "Hi Hun, sounds like you need another appointment with your surgeon, for him/her to explain things properly! Your results were good, you had no node involvement which is a good sign. It means it's highly likely the cancer was contained within the breast. Which obviously is no longer there. Whoch is why they haven't offered Chemo.  As for IF it comes back would it be incurable......NO it wouldn't necessarily become incurable. It could return in the other breast which would be classed as another primary and treated in that way. It would still be curable if it was contained to the breast or breast and nodes. You could be treated with Chemo and Radiotherapy. The only time it would be classed as incurable is if it returned in your Bones, Lungs, Liver or any other organs of the body.

      "Content": "Hi all, hope everyone is having a lovely weekend.  I received a letter this morning to say My new breast surgeon who I met a few weeks ago has requested a mammogram, the appointment is the 19th Jan!  Now when I left the appointment with him, he said all was fine and he would write to my previous Oncologist and pass me on to their oncologist (who I see on the 17th) but from his point of view, I wouldn't need to see him again until June, when my annual mammogram would be due! So not sure why I have been sent this appointment? I don't have a BCN at this hospital, yet! So I don't really have anyone to contact! I really don't want this mammogram if I don't really need it! My breasts are so sore and the last thing I need is to have them squished again! Unless I really have to! But I won't know the reason behind this sudden letter unless I can speak to someone......but who? I see the Oncologist on the 17th at which point I assume I might meet my new BCN? So do I just leave it till then? And then ask about the reason behind the mammogram request? Or should I try and find out before then? Just as I thought things were settling this stupid letter has caused more anguish! It really does feel never ending! Especially as he didn't mention a mammogram at my appointment with him! So why the sudden change? ",

      "Content": "Hi callmebruce, i\u2019m Sorry your wife finds herself in this position. I too took Tamoxifen but sadly still developed Secondaries in the bone! However I just wanted to add, bone mets can be very well treated/managed. I don\u2019t know how advanced your wife\u2019s mets are. But I have been \u2018living\u2019 with Secondaries to the bone for 3years now and fingers crossed, things have remained stable during that whole time(awaiting scan results)! I currently have the Zoladex injections to shut down my ovaries, as my Cancer is ER+ but that\u2019s all.  I have been offered a bone strengthening drug but have declined it at this point as a DEXA scan showed my bones are currently strong! But if and when that changes I have that drug and Letrozole waiting in the wings to take on any changes that might happen! In fact there is a long list of treatments that I will hopefully not need for a long time yet, but that are there if and when required.  I think the biggest piece of advice I can offer is, don\u2019t assume the Physical Cancer is the most difficult part in all this. Yes having cancer is physically exhausting some days, but it is also emotionally exhausting and frustrating some days too! In fact most days (for me)! \u2019Living\u2019 from scan appointment to scan appointment is tough, it will be a tough time for both of you. But take time out to talk, whether to each other, to counsellors, specialist nurses or on here. Just don\u2019t bottle things up. You are both in this for the long haul, which is great news.......but there will be days when it doesn\u2019t feel like goods news. Days when she\u2019ll need that extra hug and a reminder that you are in this together and that she\u2019s not alone! Secondary Cancer can be a very solitary place some times. But together you will learn to \u2018live\u2019 with this disease, NOT die from it!  Hoping that made some sense. Wishing you both all the best on this long journey. Sal xx",

      "Content": "how VERY Special this community is. I've been on this site, since my secondaries diagnosis, so approximately a year. During that time I have been supported through the lows and congratulated on the highs! I have tried to help and support others, in return for how supported I have felt. Over the last week I have been struggling, so I disappeared off to 'The Room' to off load, then I sneaked on to the secondary breast cancer board, as I know less people post on there. I just needed to find someone who could tell me it was okay to feel the way I did, and of course I did get some very nice responses. Today someone replied to one of my old posts, A Pledge to Myself......I received the email notification and then viewed the old post. I re-read it and realised that I was breaking 'some' of my own rules. It gave me the kick up the backside that I needed, while I'm going through a rough spot. My reason for writing this now, is to say to all of you, that even those of us who 'seem' to be doing so well, have off days. I have recently received so many positive comments about how my words have helped others, and of course that's always nice to here. But I feel I need to admit to you all and myself, that I have BAD days/weeks too. I scurried off to the two other areas because I was afraid to admit I was struggling. Now I realise that it may actually help others to know that it's okay to have off days, that it's not something you need to hide, in fact trying to hide your true feelings doesn't help anyone, especially not yourself.  So I have given myself a slap on the wrist and a good talking too. I still feel a bit shakey and worried about meeting my new team tomorrow, but whether tomorrow brings positive news or negative news, I know I can come on here and share. Because there will always be someone who understands or who will offer a virtual hug, or hand to hold. My family and friends will never truly understand how I feel, even if I was to be totally honest with them. But as long as I am open and honest with you all, I'm sure I can get past the bumps in the road, but only if I tell you about them! So I promise, no more hiding away if I need some support, no more trying to protect others from my bad times! Because I don't want any of you to feel you can't admit when times are hard. I want you to know that even those of us who 'seem' to be doing so well, have off days too. But sometimes we (or at least I) find it hard to admit  Sorry xxxx",

Or just give your daughter a great big hug! Find just one thing to make you smile! Go on give it a try!! Then let us know how you got on!

Going into such a confined space isn't easy. But remember if at any point you feel you've had enough or you need some reassurance then you just tell them that!  I found closing my eyes and taking slow deep breaths helped. I also counted the rep sounds the machine was making. It sounded like a weird building site to me! In some hospitals I believe you can get music, but not the one I was in! I just got ear plugs but it was still quite loud!  Although once I found out what was making all that noise I felt much more relaxed. Now it's actually top secret and they don't really like everyone to know. But Helen I think you need to know what's causing all the sounds you are about to hear, so that as you are lying there you will be able to picture this............ See the noises are nothing to worry about, it's just the staff letting off steam!! You CAN do this HUN! You know you can! Sal xx",

But if it has and things seem to be getting worse than I think it's probably time to seek some proffessional help, as well as support from this site!  You seem to be reading a lot in to what others are thinking and feeling! I'm sure when your friends ask about when you might be returning to work, it's not because they are jealous of your time off but perhaps because they can see how unhappy and down you appear and feel that getting back to work could help?! I don't know you or your friends so forgive me if I am totally wrong! Is there a reason you can't work? Or are you just not ready too......which is fine and totally understandable!  It really sounds like you are surrounded by so many 'little' problems that are gradually turning into huge problems because you have so much time to think about them! You sound like you are surrounded by friends who are trying to understand but are failing to offer you the support you need at the moment, through no fault of their own! They haven't been through this so they could never understand! I think seeing your GP and explaining how you are feeling might open up access to some counselling if you feel talking would help. Or they can point you in the direction of CA who might be able to help with the financial issues, or where to access whatever support you feel would help you!  But the main thing I am trying to say Hun is that you don't have to do this alone! There is help and support there for you if and when you decide you need it and I totally understand how scary it is to take that first step in admitting you need support! Now I shall offer you a ((((((((((((((((supportive hug)))))))))))))))) it won't solve anything but I hope it shows you that 'someone' cares about you and more importantly someone is REALLY listening to you! Take care Hun. Sal xxxxxx",

Now all I need is for all of you to pop along to the hospital tomorrow and sit with me through my appointment  Any takers?! I think my biggest problem is I hate change, I am a routine based Gal, I like to know where I am and what I'm doing. The London hospital might of been useless, but I knew their system, I knew my way round and I felt comfortable there! This hospital looks really nice from the outside, and the staff in the breast surgery bit seemed nice. So am hoping the Oncology team will be just as nice. But the uncertainty is difficult to deal with. I have written down everything I need to discuss but then wonder whether I should mention EVERYTHING at this appointment? I don't want them to think I'm a bit OTT! But at the same time I am at a point where I need to feel in control of all this, I can't drop back in to my old ways of just agreeing to everything, of that makes sense?  I want to do what's best for me.....but that means physically and emotionally best. I want to continue to live my life feeling happy! I want to try and get the pain sorted and in a perfect world I would appreciate a bit more sleep too.......and less hot flushes, or at least less severe!! Too much to ask for?! Anyway I will report back tomorrow, although won't be until late as I'm working till 9pm, it's going to be a long long day!  Thanks again for the messages, sending ((((((((((((hugs))))))))))) to you all.

For me it was like they were burning, very painful after walking just a short distance and standing still was almost impossible!  So I used to wear 2 pairs of socks and put those cushioned shoe liners in my shoes, which helped.  At night I smothered them in moisteriser and put a sock on over the top, so the cream would be absorbed through the night. Which definitly helped me! As for being back to normal....sadly it doesn't work like that. Unfortunately people around us don't really understand, and why would they? They haven't been through it! You have to allow yourself time to get through the emotional side of all this. For some that involves counselling, for others it's just a case of finding a way of getting your true feelings out and dealing with them.  Just remember you are never alone, we are all here to listen, if you need us  xxxxx",

I've never felt I was getting older, until my first ever child that I looked after, sent me a photo of her baby......I worked out the dates and she was definitly old enough  Oh and the occasion one of my ex children offered me a drink in the pub  He was old enough too!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Sam (Mumof3plusoh), firstly great name and hope you are being spoilt today ;-) As for the pain it could be you have pulled a muscle without realising it, or the muscle was pulled around during surgery, they aren't gentle once you are knocked out! Either way it's definitely worth mentioning at your appointment on Tuesday! Have you been keeping up with the exercises that they give you after surgery? These are important as they stop things getting stiff. Also not sure what they recommend these days, but I was told no underwire bras for at least a few months following surgery! But that advice was 4 almost 5 years ago. So perhaps things have changed. What I am saying in a long winded manner is its most likely muscular or surgery damage and scar tissue can also cause referred pain. All possibilities but hopefully your surgeon/oncologist will examine you and put your mind at ease! Sending you a (((((((((((((Gentle Hug))))))))))) Sal xxxx",

There are a lot of nasty bugs going around. I had a cough and cold that lasted over a month. Then came back a week later! Such a nightmare! So we have fingers crossed its nothing serious! However IF and its a big IF, it turns out to be metastasises from the BC then it IS treatable! It's not like having Lung Cancer! It will be treated how your BC was treated. So it's highly likely you WILL be around to see your grandchildren grow up! Its totally normal to have all these horrid thoughts going around in your head. But it's a waste of time and energy! So off load here and then try and put it to one side and keep busy! Difficult when you feel rough I know! Maybe watch some rubbish tv or a box set!

      "Content": "Hi Jane, I could of written your post myself! I finished Chemo the end of Feb 2014! I have suffered with pain and side effects from the Chemo, radiotherapy and hormone therapies. BUT BEFORE EVERYONE PANICS........it's not been constant. It comes and goes. The radiotherapy has caused issues with hardening in my breast which proves uncomfortable at times. I also have Lymphoedema!  So I can totally understand your feelings on all this and I understand how you feel about not feeling happy! I was surrounded with family and a couple of friends throughout, although family were only via the phone and occasional visits, basically I did this on my own, and it was bloody hard. Every time I hit a memorable anniversary I think back to where I was and how far I have come. Does that make me happy? No not really, in fact the opposite it makes me see how Cr*p all this was, and at times continues to be. I allow myself time to feel sad, to cry to wish things were different.  But then I get back up dust myself off and look to what I have achieved and enjoy the fact that I am still here and I am surrounded by people that love and care for me, and more importantly people that I love and care for. I think about how much control I have regained, how I am now 'living' with my Cancer (I have secondary cancer) and it's not controlling me anymore. I don't panic at every little pain, I don't just say yes to every thing the doctor offers. I research things I consider side effects and I work out whether it's something I can live with. I will NEVER forget, the day I was told I had Cancer, or the day I had surgery or the first Chemo or my first Radiotherapy etc etc etc......but you know what the one big thing that you can take from all this, is that you are still here you are currently NED and you are still living your life! Allow yourself time to mourn your past, but don't allow the Cancer that you HAD to destroy your future! It's hard to ignore every ache and pain, but the reality is IF it's a pain that comes and goes it's likely to be due to over doing it, just like aches and pains happened before you had cancer! I hate to say this as I'm a year older next Sat, but (((((whispers)))))) we aren't getting any younger  But the side effects from the hormone drugs will be making everything worse. I think it sounds like you are doing amazingly well and that today you just needed to release all those feelings and feel that you aren't the only one who feels like this! I promise you there are lots of us who feel exactly as you do, and all I can say is things do get easier, your past will never be forgotten, but eventually it will be the distant past......it just takes time......keep going and keep sharing. I have discovered this year that writing down how I feel really helps! It feels then like I don't have to hold those thoughts in, that I am allowed to admit my true feelings....even if I don't actually tell someone face to face....my online friends, no a lot more about me and my Cancer, than any of my family. Which suits me fine as the people on here can understand far more than anyone who hasn't walked in our shoes! Hope that made some sense. Sending you a very (((((((((((supportive hug)))))))))) xxxxxx",

So for the last few months I seem to of spent every other week waiting for results of some sort or another! Last week I had a mammogram, my 3rd one since diagnosis. I didn't think I was too anxious about waiting for results, but as the days pass I'm finding its all I can think about   I know the odds are all will be fine, as I only recently had a PET scan. But BCN said that doesn't guarantee the all clear, as the mammogram will pick up any minor changes. So I went from feeling fairly positive to feeling anxious again. Will I ever get used to waiting for results? Or is being anxious all part of this rubbish disease? Xx",

Off to see the GP tomorrow in the hope that she will be able to help.  One of my main issues at the moment is my mood/emotions. I have never felt so tearful, I literally cry at everything and anything. It's really getting me down. I was informed yesterday that my BCN is changing jobs, so I will have a new BCN.....I cried when I read the email. Which is ridiculous, bearing in mind she was pretty useless! BUT she was a familiar face, and in all this uncertainty it was good to have a friendly familiar face. I keep telling myself that the new one might be better (she couldn't be much worse) but I just feel so unsettled right now. I have written my list of moans (possible Zoladex side effects) to discuss with the GP. It's hard to know which is most important or bothering me the most, so I think I'll just go with blurting them all out, and hope she doesn't think I am some sort of looney!! I seem to go along okay for a few weeks and then I get hit with another thing that adds to my issues, and makes me feel uneasy again. The latest incident was realising that I am having issues with my balance, funny how you learn to compensate for things without realising you are doing it. But when you stop and think you realise it's been going on for a few months. Anyway I just needed to off load. Hopefully today will be a better day and tomorrow my GP will hopefully 'listen' to me!

My biopsy that I had done last week came back clear  and I also heard back from one of the jobs I went for. The lady said I had set the bar very high for the people that followed me in the interviews, she has a few more left to see, but she just wanted to check how I felt about things and whether I was still interested in the position!  I'm not going to get my hopes up, but I am pleased to of got such good feed back!

You are feeling anxious and probably not sleeping both of which can cause headaches. It's such a tough time Hun but try not to let your thoughts run wild.  Take things one day at a time. If that's too much then go hour by hour! Try and fill your day with activities that you enjoy. Treat yourself. Even if it's just coffee and cake with a friend. Enjoy it while you can, your taste buds go AWOL while you are on chemo! Sorry to hear you have had to change hospitals, that won't of helped with the anxiety. But try to trust your new team. They are there to help you through this. Ask as many questions as you need to. I always go in with a list as I find my mind goes blank the minute I walk in! You will feel more relaxed once your treatment plan is explained and started. Until then there are loads of lovely ladies and gents on here to help you every step of the way. So take things slowly Hun and try to relax. Worrying won't change anything! Although I know its hard not to! Sending you a ((((((((gentle welcome hug)))))) Sal xxxxx",

But you will also have days when you wake up feeling more in control. Those are the days you try and get on with things and put Cancer on the back burner, so to speak! Yes you have cancer but the oncologist and surgeon will deal with that. You just concentrate on looking after your mental health! You need to find nice things to fill a few hours! Give yourself permission to have cancer free time! Your headaches are highly likely to be just that, headaches! However if it's really concerning you then speak to your oncologist when you see them! But if you sat down and think about it, do the headaches get worse/appear when you are thinking/worrying about breast cancer!!! Sending you (((((((HUGS)))))) YOU CAN DO THIS HUN!! xxxx",

So for the last few months I seem to of spent every other week waiting for results of some sort or another! Last week I had a mammogram, my 3rd one since diagnosis. I didn't think I was too anxious about waiting for results, but as the days pass I'm finding its all I can think about   I know the odds are all will be fine, as I only recently had a PET scan. But BCN said that doesn't guarantee the all clear, as the mammogram will pick up any minor changes. So I went from feeling fairly positive to feeling anxious again. Will I ever get used to waiting for results? Or is being anxious all part of this rubbish disease? Xx",

I have found during my last few Oncology appointments the oncologist doesn't seem to have a clue who I am or where I am at with treatment. Bearing in mind I have secondary Breast Cancer I had to ask if he planned to do another scan before my next appointment!! I left feeling he just wasn't interested! I always hope that I am just unlucky and that most people have good experiences, but sadly from what I have heard there are lots of people who feel the same! Well done on your husband for standing up for you. I always go on my own which at times I regret. What I will suggest is IF you don't feel you got all the answers that you needed from your appointment call your BCN and explain and I am sure she can arrange another appointment. Alternatively contact PALS they are great, in my experience!  Sending you a ((((((((((supportive hug)))))))))) after what sounds like a difficult day xxx",

It could very well be that your ovaries are kicking back into gear as at your age you won't necessarily of gone through a natural menopause. I was 38 at diagnosis and my periods stopped on my second cycle of FEC! I went on to have one more Fec then 3 of the Tax. A year after my chemo finished my periods returned with a vengeance! Now I wasnt on the herceptin like you as mine was estrogen positive. So I was taking tamoxifen. However any unexplained bleeding should be mentioned to your GP or Oncologist/BCN whoever you have the easiest contact with. They will be able to reassure you that this is normal. It could be that you are going to start getting periods again or it might me the start of menopause. They might want to do a simple ultrasound just to check and see what's going on! So nothing to worry about but in my opinion definitely worth asking one of your health professionals.  My one friendly warning would be, IF your periods do return BE PREPARED they might be a lot heavier than they were! Hopefully that was just my experience, but being forewarned is always best in my opinion. Hope you can get things sorted soon. Take Care. Sal xxx",

I have bone mets in my sternum and also 2 metal plates which were put in after they removed part of my sternum/ribs in February this year!  I HATE taking painkillers, mainly because the side effects have been awful,but also up to now the pain was 'okay' or at least bearable! But now I have pain in the sternum, which could be the mets although last scan said they were stable (which is great) could be nerves repairing themselves? Or muscle pain?  OR It could be breast pain?? Who knows! It changes from day to day which is why it's difficult to explain to my GP   I am currently on Zoladex injections every 3 weeks! Hormones are clearly all over the place. But I don't feel depressed (like I did on Tamoxifen) This is just pure exhaustion, and pain. I'm sat here now with a throbbing pain in my sternum, like someone is poking me with a red hot poker (obviously I don't know how that feels, but just surmising)!  I'm not sure what needs sorting first, but I think if I can get the pain under control everything else might just fall into place! Or I will at least feel more able to deal with it. I want this Christmas to be enjoyable, I don't another one spoilt by feeling rubbish! Anyway, better get ready to head off to doc's! Will report back later! Thanks for the support, it's very much appreciated xxxx",

Hot flushes have got worse and my sleep is still disrupted, waking every 1.5 to 2hrs throughout the night. I'm exhausted. Last time I saw her she 'listened' while tapping away on her computer. Told me there were a few painkillers I could try, but didn't really seem to understand how much I am struggling. My mood is very up and down at the moment, but on bad days I am really finding it hard to cope. I have spent so long telling everyone I am fine and I can cope, that I can't find a way of explaining how tough I am finding this. I was hoping the pain would of been sorted in the last few weeks, but as I am sat typing this with tears Streaming down my face....I think I can say they haven't sorted anything...yet! I know things take time, but I am just so uncomfortable and scared that this is as good as it gets!!  I begin my new job in January and I want to try and get things sorted before then.

I saw the GP and bursting into tears after she asked me how I was, seemed to make her listen! Although embarrassing for me! We chatted for a few minutes about everything, okay it took more than a few minutes! But she listened and this time I mean really listened. She has suggested continuing with the painkillers and also adding another drug at night that will 'hopefully' help with pain control and help me to sleep! She's going to let me try it for a week and if it doesn't help, she'll discuss other options with me. So I am seeing her again next week. The drug she's given me is actually an antidepressant too, so it might help with mood and hot flushes too......which would be a win win if it works! Someone on here mentioned seeing my Oncologist to discuss things. I only saw them a few weeks ago, but sadly didn't see my proper Oncologist but one of his minions...she was very young and just smiled along in all the right places, basically told me everything would improve in time.....thanks.....but not much help! I know a lot of my problems are that I hate to feel I'm being pathetic and not coping! Not helped by everyone around me telling me that I'm 'lucky' that the Cancer has only spread to the one area! I appreciate things could be worse, but dealing with the side effects from lack of eostrogen as well as the pain from surgery and the Lymphoedema, isn't a picnic in the park!  I'm trying to find the positives in each day, but every now and then I have off days too (okay quite a lot of off days recently)  Sorry xxxx",

You shouldn't be left feeling like this.  I don't know if I'm allowed to make a plug for a different charity, but if you are in London then look up the number for The Haven immediately. They have people who can help you, advise you and literally see you through this for free. Stay strong, I know it's easy to say, hard to do on your own, but you have come this far. My old Dad used to say\"it's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil\" so I wish you the strength to start sqeaking- very loudly.  We are all with you on this one. X Thanks Under Par, I'm not in London anymore, but did visit the haven when I was first diagnosed with Breast Cancer, they were amazing! I believe there is a Force cancer centre at the hospital I am hopefully transferring my treatment too. So I will at some point see what support/groups they have to offer! Quick Update, I am taking some form of pain meds every 2 hours throughout the day and for the first time in over a year, I am pretty much pain free  it's early days, but for the last two nights I have only woken once each night!

You have a lovely family, who love you for who you are whether you are sweaty Betty or not  its weird that of all the stuff we have been through being hot and sweaty really is the pits, although I think that is mainly down to the fact that we can't see an end to it! I lasted 18 months on tamoxifen and just got lower and lower, it was the Pitts. Starting to struggle on Zoladex, but the difference now is that I am giving myself a break, yes I hate taking tablets, BUT I didn't choose to get breast cancer, so if they are going to give me drugs to keep me alive, I am going to take drugs to make my life worth living! Have you spoken to your GP about this? Or Oncologist? You've tried hard to sort this on your own, now it's time to pull in the reinforcements to help you! This may be the GP, Oncologist or a Counsellor/psychologist! They are all their to help us, but as I have discovered you have to be totally honest with them about how CR*P this is, and I mean really honest!  When I reached breaking point I listed down all my issues and worked through them one at a time with the oncologist and then GP! I am gradually sorting one issue out at a time! Hot flushes are still an issue and getting worse  BUT hopefully I will find a solution for those too at some point! I'm sat writing this with sweat dripping down my face  It's horrid and I feel dirty all the time, but I keep reminding myself, it's not my fault and hopefully things will calm down! But in the mean time I WILL find something that helps me! Because I deserve to be happy! So do you Hun, so please think about trying some medication to help!  I am around and willing to listen, so feel free to message me, anytime! No one is ever alone on this journey, but we all need to be brave and admit that sometimes life after/with Cancer is a real struggle   Sending you the biggest ((((((((hug)))))))) ever xxx",

In the last few weeks they have been getting more frequent and worse, to the point I am literally dripping with sweat  so embarrassing! Seems to happen every time I eat anything?! So short of giving up eating, I don't know what I can do, so really hoping these drugs work!

Many years ago (when cancer was never in the picture) it was only when I cried that my GP took me seriously!! It's just not on!  Anyway SORRY I just think you are such a lovely lady that (as many others have said) is so kind to everyone and I'm feeling mad with the way you were treated. Anyway I'm glad the last person took you seriously and you have some new medication now.

I had surgery 3 years ago and had to wait 2 weeks after surgery to find out if the nodes contained cancer. Then had to go back for further surgery. So this is definitely a great improvement. Sorry to hear about your mums struggle with Lymphoedema, but just wanted to say that we are all different. I was diagnosed with Lymphoedema and I need to wear a sleeve daily....but in all honesty other than being hot in this weather, it's been okay. I put my sleeve on each morning and don't even think about it. You mention having Radiotherapy to the armpit and yes I believe they can do that. But i also believe that radiotherapy can also increase your risk of Lymphoedema  so I don't think you can assume this will guarantee you won't get it! Sorry! I think you have to make a decision that you are happy with and you can live with. Hopefully your node will be clear  so you won't need either. But I would ask your surgeon what he/she thinks is the best option. It's a tough decision. ",

I had a VERY dodgy internet access, so was able to read posts but not reply.  I had a tough few days which ended with 36hrs in hospital hooked to IV antibiotics/fluids. It appears I was allergic to the antibiotics that they had given me, hence the throwing up! Will spare you all the details, let's just say by the time I reached hospital I was a mess both physically and emotionally. I am now back at my parents, with the house to myself till tomorrow afternoon. So hopefully can catch up on some much needed sleep in order to feel semi human by Tuesday, and my first day af my new job! But just wanted you to know that your messages kept me going yesterday, I was in a private room with no visitors, as I didn't call my parents and my sisters were both busy! So reading your kind words really helped, especially as I was in a very dark place thinking dark thoughts (not helped by being in hospital)! Today I feel very rough and tired, but definitly on the mend. They have suggested having another chest X-ray in a week, just to check it's clear! But right now I just need some rest and plenty of fluids. So Thankyou very much for being such kind, considerate and understanding ladies. ((((((((((Hugs)))))))) to you all. P.S Wombat that was great news re:clear CT.....I was going to have serious words with you today! But instead I can say, I'm really pleased for you  xxxxx ",

I tried to think about nice things rather than getting overwhelmed by \"what might be\"!  It meant I was much more relaxed when I went in for the scan. Sadly the results showed they haven't removed all the cancer from my sternum, the scan showed there was still activity. So I am now having the Zoladex 3 weekly instead of 4, in the hope my periods will stop. If not he's saying next step will be removal of ovaries!!  But the one big positive was that things haven't got any worse! So I suppose I need to be grateful for that.  Hope you are doing okay! Thanks for the great advice. Looks like I will be going through another scan in 3 months, but will now be able to cope better  so thanks xx",

Now the tricky bit is I don't know what is causing it! It could be down to the Zoladex injections? It could be Lymphoedema? It could be the nerves still repairing after surgery? Or I could just be a wimp   If I describe it to you, maybe just maybe someone will of experienced the same or something similar! Firstly they hurt when I lift anything, then I get a burning sensation in a couple of different areas, and when I say burning I mean burning, then I get the stabbing pains on and off! All this is while I'm taking Naproxen and Paracetemol throughout the day   I am really struggling at the moment, obviously the biopsy has added to the pain, but even before that I wasn't coping very well. Both the GP and Oncologist don't seem to understand how painful and hard this is to cope with.....I'm trying so hard to get on with life, but it's exhausting and I'm finding myself getting more and more frustrated.  I'd like to be able to go into my appointment and get some answers this time, I think 8 months of dealing with this is long enough.....isn't it?

Cocodamol I had when having chemo and constipation was a big issue, I am already taking a stool softener so don't really want to add to that! I think the problem is I seem to have so many unresolved issues, which is why I can't start the bone strengthening drug or the Letrozole. I hit breaking point when on Tamoxifen and sadly I can feel myself heading the same way because of this constant pain  The added issue is I'm now working and I know they will say that I'm over doing it....I'm not, I'm in pain whether I'm sitting still, walking around, lifting or not, it's just there and has been for months!  BCN did mention in passing that if all else fails I could talk to the hospice people, as they are more experienced with pain control, but I feel I need to give the GP a chance first. But I NEED her to really listen and not just palm me off with anything, that 'might' work! She's already told me I shouldn't be on naproxen as I have blood pressure issues!  I'm a 42 year old who just wants to lead a pain free life, am I expecting too much?! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Fiddlecrab, sounds like your unit is really trying to support its younger patients. Wish all hospitals were the same. In my experience what lacks is there ability to see that although we all have the same disease, we are all in very different places in our lives! A lady in her 60's is possibly retired or nearing retirement, so can think about slowing down. A lady who is under 45 and has a young family to look after or works full time has a very different out look.  I found there was always a lot of talk about how well you 'might' do over the next 5/10years.....well at 38 when diagnosed, I was hoping for a lot longer than 5/10 years. So I think they would benefit younger patients by not talking in terms of the next 10 years, instead just talk about the treatment hopefully doing its job. I think more support is needed for young ladies taking hormone therapies. I found absolutely no support when I was seriously struggling with Tamoxifen, I explained at the time that if I was 60/70 I wouldn't mind feeling so rubbish, as I would have the time to rest and relax when needed. But as a 38year old who felt about 90 most days it was hard. I was trying to work while feeling awful. They need to understand that young people still NEED to work, they have to earn a living. I think all hospitals would benefit from realising that living with cancer isn't a Mon-Fri, 9-5 illness. Where's the support and help for those of us who work? Those of us who don't want to use up all our annual leave going to cancer related groups! How about someone think about doing some evening groups or weekends? I'm sure it's not just me who works in a job where I can't just pop out for a few hours to attend a group! Not sure if that's the type of thing your BCN is looking for, but it was good to say it out loud, anyway Xxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi NikNic, just want to try and calm you slightly! When they told you IF it has spread they can't cure you......that DOESN'T mean you are going to die any time soon! Stage 4 breast cancer, the stage you will be IF it has spread, is still VERY treatable. No you won't ever be cured or Cancer free, but you will hopefully remain on treatments that will keep the cancer under control/stable for many many years!  I don't really want to go into much more detail, because I think it's important that you take things one step at a time. Right now you have Cancer that is curable, until you know any different. There are many ladies on here who have had node involvement that had clear CT scans! So don't assume because it's in the nodes it has to be elsewhere. The nodes are doing their job by trapping the cancer cells. IF however you get the news that it has spread, please come on to the secondaries breast group and you will find lots of us, who are 'living' fairly normal lives. There are ladies who have just started on this journey and others who have been living with Cancer for years and years! So PLEASE don't think this is the end of the world. Because although it is Cr*p and the last thing anyone wants to deal with, there's every chance you will be around for a very long time yet.....and not all treatments make you feel awful and unable to function! So you can still get quality of life too! Allow yourself time to get used to the diagnosis but try not to over think things, take it day by day and deal with things IF and WHEN they happen. But remember you are not alone. We will all be with you every step of the way, if you need us! Now I shall offer you the BIGGEST...... HUG, because I think you could really do with one. Hope that helps a little  Xxxxx",

But my cancer spread to my sternum, I had surgery to remove the area, but they didn't get it all and yes I know things could be worse?........but they could be a hell of a lot better too. i spoke with my BCN this week and I completely broke down, I admitted to her and probably more importantly to myself, that I wasn't 'fine'! I was angry, and fed up and just wanted my old life back! I'm not strong I'm not brave I'm scared and lonely, because this is not how I expected things to go. I remember someone saying, you give me a year of your life and I'll give you your life back! Well it's been 3 years and I'm still waiting and clearly for me it's never going to happen.  She suggested seeing a psychologist to talk things through, and maybe at some point I will.

I don't often say this but sometimes I think it helps others to know how low you can get! But reassuring others that MOST people taking Tamoxifen of other hormone therapies do Okay! But I reached desperation point, like you and I would of quite happily of stepped in front of a bus just to end the living hell I was in! EVENTUALLY someone listened and we discussed things! Now onto your situation I would firstly say, have you discussed with the Oncologist how big a difference this drug is having? My cancer was 8/8 on both E and P so I assumed the Tamoxifen was giving me the best chance of staying Cancer free.......but when I spoke to the Oncologist and he put it through the  system, it came back as Tamoxifen giving me an extra 3% protection! Was that enough for me to spend years feeling like that? Well for me no, BUT the decision was taken from me as my secondaries were discovered at the scan results appointment, at which I was going to tell him I was ready to stop the Tamoxifen!  Now, what I can say is........how would I of felt IF I had stopped the tamoxifen 3 months before as I had wanted, then found it had spread? Would I of blamed myself? Would I of hated myself for making the wrong decision? Or would I of thought, well it must of been there before I stopped the drug? What I am saying in a VERY complicated way (sorry) is that YOU are the only one who can decide what to do! It's YOUR body and YOUR life! Picking quality over quantity is a big decision! But it just might be the right one for you! Take your time get as much information as you can and remember even if it did recur it could hopefully still be successfully treated!  One last thing which I'm sure you've heard a thousand times! Have you tried different brands? It does make a difference! Also how about trying Letrozole or another of the hormone drugs? I totally understand if you don't want to try anything else! I hold you find a solution that works for you! But PLEASE talk think through and make an informed decision! Take Care. Sal xxx",

A couple of friends asked his I was and I told them how awful I felt.....I could see them completely lost for words. Then that annoying reply of \"keep your chin up\" and I think that was the last time I bothered to share my 'true' feelings. I didn't like hurting other people's feelings, so saying \"I'm Fine\" was just easier for them to cope with. Maybe we both need to take that leap of faith and see someone to talk about how we are really feeling! Xx",

Coming up to a year since my secondary cancer diagnosis and I realise that I am no further on, in dealing with what's happened. My own fault as I can't face seeing a counsellor at the moment. But today I cried on the way to work as the bus was late  My emotions are all over the place, still. The pain still isn't sorted and no one really seems to know what's causing it. For the last 4 nights I've only managed a couple of hours sleep before waking with night sweats, everything soaking. I'm plastered in unexplained bruises and just feeling generally CR*P. It's like the Tamoxifen battle all over again  I'm tired and fed up!  My new oncologist was nice but I realise now that he didn't solve anything, he gave me a whole list of things that he would like to try but nothing on how to deal with the issues I already have! My GP listens and gives me pain relief but it's just not helping! I'm exhausted, I have this bloody biopsy tomorrow, oh and my breast is being a complete pain in the backside, causing me more worries! I'm just frustrated!  This 'living' with Secondary Cancer is bloomin hard work! I know I will find my positive thinking again, but right now my get up and go, got up and left! MOAN OVER!  xxxxxx",

      "Content": "magi24, Welcome to the group! Although really sorry you find yourself here.  Now first things first, take some slow deep breaths! Try and relax! Which I know is easier said than done!  I can't help with how long you will have to wait for surgery because all areas are different. But hopefully you have been introduced to a Specialist nurse. She is there to support and answer questions like this, so give her a call on Monday and ask for an approximate time scale! I waited a month from diagnosis to surgery, just to reassure you that 2 weeks isn't that long! Although I know to you it feels like forever! As for the increased pain and headaches! Our bodies and mind plays nasty little tricks on us. Before we find that pesky lump we just get on with the day ignoring any little twinge of pain! HOWEVER as soon as we are diagnosed with Cancer our mind seems to go into overdrive. We notice EVERY little thing going on with our bodies. We also start thinking that every little twinge must be Cancer related! The Cancer must be travelling around the body and growing everyday!  The reality is, all these other issues are completely unrelated to the Cancer! In a physical sense anyway! Your feeling unwell and the headache is likely to be the stress of all this. Totally understandable! But try to relax as much as you can! You might find then that the headaches ease! Remember you probably had headaches before your Cancer diagnosis too! Try and reassure yourself that you are being looked after! They will be doing their best to get you in for surgery ASAP! However I do think calling the Breast Care Nurse and asking for some sort of time scale might just help you to relax a bit. The not knowing is always the worse!  I hope you can begin to relax a little and at least have a break from the headaches for a bit. Keep talking to us on here. We all know how you feel, as we have all been there. Any questions you have just ask! The odds are someone will have an answer for you. Although sometimes we don't need answers we just need to feel listened too and supported. So on that note I shall offer you a Supportive,...... Hope the surgery date comes soon and you can start on the road to recovery! Take Care Hun. Sal xxxx",

Today I was caught off guard, even though my BCN had pre warned me that the oncologist might want to do a biopsy. I had gone assuming he would take a look, say it's just scar tissue and send me on my way! So unlike me to think like that.....usually I prepare for the worse! Anyway the ultrasound of the area was ridiculously painful, you all know how hard they press, well that on top of already being in pain it was horrendous. The lady doing it kept apologising and then said, but we need a good look  Thinking about it now still brings tears to my eyes. I just couldn't cope with the pain and that was before the bloody needle came in to play! i'll spare you anymore details. My BCN was called in just to add to the embarrassment, she was great but I felt so stupid! I suppose I'm just not used to struggling.....but then I'm not used to dealing with so much, while also working and trying to get my life back on track! Anyway, my BCN has booked me in on Wednesday, she's suggested I take more pain relief on that morning, so I will hopefully be slightly more comfortable. I just have to keep reminding myself that it will all be over in 10minutes.....I know I can do it, well I don't have much choice! Now to enjoy the weekend and forget about today's drama.

If it was M1 or M2 it's not suspicious and unlikely to be cancer! Or at least that's what I found when I looked on Google! Oh and the A3 will be undetermined! In other words they will biopsy the nodes during surgery to see if the nodes are affected! Hope that helps a little! So it's just doctor talk, nothing to worry about! Xxx",

Following sternum surgery I was in severe pain, I certainly wouldn't want to go through that again. But this pain isn't as severe but it's constant, which is hard to live with! I had my last PET CT in Nov and that showed things were stable! So hopefully this is all down to nerve/bone pain, I did have two metal plates put in my sternum and I wonder if that adds to the pain issues?! All stuff I need to discuss with GP or someone more specialised. Thanks for taking the time to reply xxxx",

I try to be as honest as I can and all the advice I give, comes from my own experience. My theory being if I can stop someone else feeling as lonely and bad as I did at times, then me going through it was worth it.  BUT I need to be honest with you all today and admit (not easy for me) that  I had a meltdown today, a big time meltdown! Which is VERY unlike me in fact in the last 3.5years I have never panicked and over reacted like I did today. It was embarrassing and stupid, but at the time it was just all too much for me. I suppose I hit my breaking point!  I have spent all day giving my self a hard time until someone from here text me and listened to me and helped me realise that it's okay to admit that I struggled and that it's nothing to be ashamed of......apparantly emotions make me 'human' So I am admitting very openly that sometimes things do get too much for all of us, but it doesn't mean we have failed, it doesn't mean we have given up, it just means today is a bad day and after getting up and dusting ourselves off (with the help/support of friends) we CAN and WILL succeed next time!  Wednesday will be my 'next time' and hopefully I will be more prepared. At least I know that if I do struggle it's okay, and I don't need to pretend it never happened, while giving myself a hard time! I know I'm my own worse enemy, and I need to give myself the advice I give others  xxxx",

They have a job to do but they don't want to hurt you.  Also take some painkillers an hour or two before your appointment, I found that helped a lot. Plan something nice to do afterwards, so that this experience is just a small part of your day. As for the emotions of going back to the place you were diagnosed, it's tough.

Do you know if it's possible for PN to reappear years after Chemo has finished, if the person suffered with it during Chemo? As I said mine sorted itself about a year after chemo finished. But in the last 6 months I have been getting the same issues back again, numb fingertips, sore burning feet or numb feet. Its very frustrating, but more so because no one will say whether it's connected to the chemo or not?! I just get the usual it's not normal but!! Which doesn't help solve the issue!

This is why I find I can off load on here, I can be honest and know that I won't be judged, and even if someone is judging me I can't see them so I will never know  weird I know, but it somehow makes sense to me! I am keeping busy Baki, strangely enough I'm more worried about having the biopsy than getting the results! Although I suppose that might change once I get through the biopsy (okay if I get through the biopsy)! Exeter is a beautiful city, after spending years in London I now realise how much I love my home city  Spent today with my nieces, I'm exhausted, but had an amazing time, once we got over the mini drama of my youngest niece asking me if I was going to die soon  Something was said at school and bless her heart she was so upset!

Do you know if they typically tell you the results whilst you're there or do you have to go back for them?  Hi Rach, this will very much depend on your hospital. Some tell you right away that all looks okay, others do the mammogram and send the results in the post, just like they do for other ladies who haven't had cancer! Something to ask your BCN. I know on my first mammogram post treatment, my results took about a week to come through, but my BCN did call to say all was well before the letter arrived. It's a stressful time, but best to try and keep busy and not think about it.  Hope today goes better than you are imagining! Just keep reminding yourself it will be over before you know it.

I'm currently on the Zoladex and although that has side effects they have been bearable, although the last few weeks have been rough!

Although I don't think it helps that Oncologists and GP's seem reluctant to admit that different brands can cause different side effects!

Not sure there's much you can do, others than search your local pharmacys and see if you can get some sourced, you shouldn't have to do this, but that's just how things are, I'm afraid. I hope you are able to get this sorted, or you find another brand/tablet that suits you better! I wish these drug companies/health authorities would realise how awful these side affects can be!

Sorry you find yourself here, but you have certainly come to the right place for advice and more importantly support!  I don\u2019t think it matters how early your Cancer was caught, or how big/small the tumour is. It\u2019s still Cancer and it\u2019s popped up in your life uninvited and very unwelcome! Feeling scared is totally understandable, this disease has taken away your peace of mind! It\u2019s made you question life and it\u2019s made you think about your mortality, we have all been there Hun and let\u2019s face it it\u2019s a pretty shitty place to be!  So let\u2019s try and reassure you and give you a helping hand out of that quick sand that you are probably currently stood in! Breast Cancer is VERY treatable especially when it is caught early! The surgery is very straight forward and usually done as a day case! Once you have had your surgery your mind will be a little clearer because the Cancer will be gone, the radiotherapy is used to \u2018mop up\u2019 any minute cells that might of been there! It\u2019s the \u2018belt and braces\u2019 of treatment!  If you are finding yourself really worried and unable to sleep or think straight during the day. It might be worth seeing your GP for something to calm you down. But sometimes coming on here and talking about your fears is enough to help clear your head! If there is anything you want to ask then ask away. Day or night there is usually someone around who will be able to answer your questions and don\u2019t think that any question is a \u2018silly question\u2019 I promise you we have all asked what seems like silly question at times!  Well I think I have probably gabbled on enough! So I shall leave you in peace! But please remember we are all here to help you in any way we can! So don\u2019t feel you have to do this alone because you don\u2019t! We will be here every step of the way! Sal xx",

I was greeted with my usual hug and kiss, but the youngest whose 10, hugged me and whispered I don't want you too die, and burst into tears! Apparantly some of the children at school were discussing cancer, they were doing a lesson on local charity's, anyway my niece mentioned that I had Cancer and she was told I was going to die soon, because everyone with Cancer dies We had a long long chat about the cancer I have and how it's treatable and that I hope to be around for a long time, but that sometimes people do die of cancer, but usually after they have been very ill for a while. Just wanted her to know the truth, well as near to the truth as I could.  We then went on to have a lovely day. But on my way home I couldn't hold back the tears, I was so sad that she had had to hear that and how upset it had made her. I was just glad that she asked me and didn't just bottle it up (don't want her to be like her auntie in that respect)! It made me think afterwards how feared Cancer is and that even after all the advances in treatment children are still growing up thinking that Cancer is a death sentence. My sister suggested if I feel up to it I could go in to her school and chat to the children about 'living with cancer'! I'm not sure I can face it right now, but I think I should try, as I do think it's important that we try and show youngsters that being diagnosed particularly with breast cancer, isn't the end of the world! Although it feels like it when you are going through it. Maybe if we talked about these things more openly the children who are around us will possibly grow up with less fear, maybe they will not have the fear we all had when we found that lump, maybe they wouldn't put off seeing the GP, maybe they would in turn teach their children not to fear the disease!  Or will Cancer always be the thing we fear more than anything else?",

BUT times are changing, more people are surviving Cancer and many people live long term with the disease. The more I think about it the more I think, children deserve to hear more about Cancer, than just, it kills you! Maybe if we can show children how far treatments have come they in turn will pass on this thinking to their children. Maybe just maybe in 20/30 years time, we will have a cure for all cancers, but if not the children will at least be growing up in a world where Cancer can be said  the way we say, diabetes or asthma or any other long term illness! Maybe just maybe the BIG C will be a distant memory  We can but hope! Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Hun, welcome to the club that none of us wanted to join, I'd say I hope your stay is short, but I think you would prefer honest opinions! My opinion is they seem pretty sure it's Cancer, sorry! I just wish they had said that too you rather than leave you with more questions than answers. The biopsy results will tell them if it is definitely cancer and if so what type! The scans will give them a clearer picture of everything, so they have all the information they need. I know it is all happening very fast which must be very daunting, but it's better than waiting around for weeks for everything to get moving! One thing to bear in mind is, IF it does turn out to be Breast Cancer, it is VERY treatable! So don't panic! You have come to the right place, we will all be here to help, support, advise and offer (((((((((supportive hugs)))))))) but most importantly, day and night there is always someone here to talk to I hope that has helped a little, I apologise if it's not what you wanted to hear  But from my own experience I do think that sometimes they are 'fairly' sure something is cancer before they get the official biopsy results.  I hope you have a supportive family or group of friends, because they will all help you through whatever lies ahead, as will we!

You can read his advice online and also message him privately. He will definitely be able to let you know what you can claim. Good Luck  and as he reminded me, there is nothing to feel guilty about, you have paid into the system for years, the idea being money is there if you are unfortunate enough to need it. So don't feel guilty.  I am hoping I won't need to claim anything....but if I can't get a job soon I will have to!

I think the honest answer is, until they remove the lump they won't know for sure.....unless....they have already found thae cancer has spread to your lymph nodes under your arm, or if the biopsy has come back as triple negative or her+ in which case Chemo is a definite! Sorry if that doesn't help much! You know I had long hair and dreaded the thought of losing it, it had been long for over 20years. Now I have it shoulder length and I prefer it like this! Also remember you could use the cold cap! There are options! But the most important thing is to get rid of the cancer! I know it's scary, but you are not alone Hun, we are all here for you! By this time tomorrow you will of had lots of welcome messages, we are a VERY friendly bunch. All on different stages of this journey, but all very caring and supportive of each other. I should now be sleeping so I shall say goodnight and just finish by offering you a Welcome....... Hug. It's a long, tough journey Hun. But you WILL get through it. Just take it one step at a time.

There really isn't any point taking any possible remnants of cancer away if it kills you during the process!!  IF they can't operate or have to delay it would they offer Radiotherapy? As this is another way of them killing off any stray cells that the chemo 'might' of missed! Although it sounds like the chemo has done a great job! Try not to let it worry you too much. Sadly this is out of your control. They will collect all the evidence and make an informed decision, with your best interests at heart.  I do know how frustrating it is when the plan set in place is suddenly turned upside down. But I think it's one lesson I learnt very early on. There are no guarantees with this cancer journey!! Take things one day at a time and expect the unexpected!!

Yes the injection is uncomfortable and yes it might hurt quite a bit but the pain should die down almost immediately! As for the bleeding, if the nurse has nicked a vein, that can cause a fair bit of bleeding which would of been made worse by the blood thinning drugs you are on! If you are still feeling rough today I would go and get checked out. I am obviously no doctor but I have been having these injections for the last 3years every 3wks so I feel I am experienced enough to say that this isn\u2019t the norm! You can get a cream that will numb the area before you have the injection! I have never bothered as my nurse has been great and my injections only hurt for a split second! A couple have stung a bit and one did cause a rather large bruise!! But on the whole it\u2019s fine! So please don\u2019t be put off after this one bad experience! It could be the nurse hasn\u2019t done many of these injections and hasn\u2019t done it quite as well as someone whose more experienced.

As I replied immediately and the usual out of office email, bounced back! Hi,  No answer on scan as yet, I am not in tomorrow so will chase on Monday morning I am having trouble getting you into clinic on the 6th as no doctors. I can always give you the heads up on the results and get you in the week after and that will allow me to put it through the MDT if I need to. I hope that sounds okay to you. Sorry for messing you about I have tried for the 6th but I think the week after would potentially work better.  Thanks ............ So none of this was said when I met her face to face yesterday! Seriously why tell someone you will be in touch with results, when you know you won't? Do my feelings really account for nothing, with the one person who is 'supposed' to be supporting me through this? Waiting for results is bad enough, without them building up your hopes and basically telling you a pack of lies! I have had enough  she knew I needed these results so I could make decisions about my future. But they just don't care!

Very approachable and understanding, I think this one is just too young, she wants to please.....which is great, but being honest is far more important.  I have sent her an email explaining how I feel about what happened, I hope she takes on board how this has made me feel, so she doesn't let it happen again.

However he did promise to use just the right side, which he did! It's so frustrating when they give information like this, as I have Lymphoedema I would automatically avoid that arm, but if I didn't would I want to chance it?? Not sure I would!  Although like you say, for people that have had a clearance on both sides it must be tricky!",

You are a week early It's PERFECTLY NORMAL and it's something you have to go through, so you can start to make sense of everything you have just been through. It's also the point that you 'might' start grieving the life you have lost. That life you had when you weren't WORRIED about every little ache and pain, in fact you probably ignored them like we all did!  If you are near a Maggies Centre they do a great course about moving on once the main treatment is done! I think they do an online one too! Tamoxifen will hopefully keep the cancer away and you will be feeling physically better in a few months once the radiotherapy effects have worn off. Once you are back into the swing of life without constant hospital visits things will hopefully settle. But don't expect too much too soon, you have been through a lot.  Good Luck with the rest of your Radiotherapy. Remember if you are ever worried about anything, we are all here to listen and advise and so are your BCN and Oncologist. It might feel like you are being let loose to go it alone, but you aren't!

I am clearly one of those ladies, whose body loves Estrogen   Think I might have to see GP and see if she can help with some of the side effects. I was hoping someone else might be able to reassure me that I won't feel like this forever.

But if its what people see and hear in the media then that's what they are going to think! You look NORMAL so surely you are fine again! I have to tell you it's no easier when you are living with Secondary Breast Cancer! Once you tell people it's stable, they seem to hear, EVERYTHING IS FINE, because they assume stable means CURED or no more treatment! They don't seem to notice that its ongoing treatment as is Primary breast cancer if you are on hormone therapy! Somehow we need to re educate people and explain that just because the Chemo, Surgery and Radiotherapy is done, it doesn't mean life is back to normal! However much we wish it was!

Having spoken to the GP she said its normal protocol to meet the Breast Surgeon first, who will then refer me to the Oncologist! So more appointments to come! So any thoughts on what I should expect from this appointment? The letter sent was a standard letter which is sent to anyone seeing the breast surgeon for the first time, telling you tests and scans may take up to 4hrs etc etc! Now I had a mammogram in June and recently had an ultrasound of my treated breast. Now obviously they won't have access to these until they request them from my old hospital (nothing's ever simple)! So I am going to take the letters I have that are copies of what is sent to the GP, I also have the latest scan report, which I can take! But even with all this do you think they might want to do their own mammogram/ultrasound? Or maybe just wait for the resent scans to be sent to them? I want to prepare myself as I've only just started getting this pain under control and the last thing I need is a mammogram or ultrasound.  I know all hospitals are different, so really just want an idea of what might happen, if anyone else has experienced changing hospitals?!  It's funny, however long you are on this Cancer journey and however well you think you are doing, as soon as there is a hospital appointment due, that underlying panic begins Although I am going to give myself a pat on the back as I have known about this appointment for over a week and I am only starting to worry now....the day before!

There are a few useful videos online showing you how to do a gentle massage that helps the lymph flow, there are also a few simple exercises that help the lymph fluid flow!  I have been wearing a sleeve for must be 18months, and I must say...although it's not the height of fashion, it really doesn't bother me anymore. Yes it's a bit hot in summer, but typically it's the hot weather that you mainly need it. I put it on each morning just like it's another item of clothing. Nobody really takes any notice now! When I first had it I had to get used to people asking what I had done to my arm, then in turn look at their blank faces when I said I had Lymphoedema!! I think the most frustrating thing for me is that the sleeve is a constant reminder of Breast Cancer, but it's certainly not as bad as I feared.

Swimming really helped with the swelling! I was super cautious with using an insect repellant, as you really want to try and avoid insect bites. Also some doctors recommend taking a prescription for antibiotics with you, just in case you get bites or cuts and they start looking infected! Not something I've had to deal with yet...thank goodness. I saw a Lymphoedema nurse who is connected to my hospital. Luckily my arm wasn't too bad, so I didn't need the MLD, but still did show me how to do it.  My sleeve seems to be doing its job, even managed to go down a size, so that was progress. It's frustrating and at times depressing, but it's bearable. Sadly it's the hand we've been dealt and we have to live with it!  Good Luck with it xxx",

I was diagnosed in 2013, Secobdaries in 2016 and I am still here, feeling okay. Working 3 days a week and very much living with Cancer. It's not easy and some days are better than others. But if you have a good support network and you take things one step at a time, you will be fine? Sending a  Hug, to you and your wife.

I took the recommended 2 weeks off work, but was fine and bored by day 3! Obviously I rested and did the arm exercises. But for ME and we are all different, it was a simple procedure with a very quick recovery!  So if you have the time off and you feel up to seeing friends, do it! Take it a day at a time and see how YOU feel. Good Luck with the surgery, hope all goes well. Sal xxx",

Although it also sounds like you are coping really well, so well done you The CT is routine after finding cancer in the nodes, but definitly doesn't mean it's spread as the nodes are there to catch these little blighters and that's exactly what yours have hopefully done. IF any have sneaked past the Chemo will mop them up! Your emotions will be all over the place, I'm sure. Some days you feel okay and other days you are thinking very dark thoughts. But sounds like you caught things early which hopefully gives you a very good chance of kicking cancers butt! There are lots of people on here who can offer lots of advice and virtual hugs! There's a Chemo group, who share how they are getting on and help support each other. Chemo is tough but very much doable. Any questions you have just ask as someone will know the answer. If you need to rant do it, if you need a moan feel free or if you just need somewhere to share your inner most thoughts, we are all here to listen and truly understand how you feel. So I'll stop rambling on and just offer you a (((((((((((welcome hug)))))))))) xxx",

The reason.........having a biopsy today at 5, well 5 ish as they are squeezing me in at the end of the clinic, so I was told I would probably have to wait a bit! Of course I am very experienced at waiting! Although on this occasion I hope the wait isn't too long as I'm already thinking i'd rather not go through this, so the sooner they get me in the better. I'm not normally quite so pathetic, in fact when I look back I can see I coped with everything quite well, but I suppose it's just been one thing after another and I would just like a break from all this. I'm hoping that once this is done and results are in, i can relax a little and just face the fact that my treated breast will always be 'odd'! Not sure how else to describe it! So another day to get through, I suppose the sooner the day starts the sooner it finishes.....roll on tomorrow Love to all ((((((((((group hug)))))))))) xxx",

So I would assume for me that was chemo side effects! I found moisturising my feet at night with lots of lotion then putting socks on top and leaving over night helped! I also wore two pairs of socks during the day, which helped! As for knee pain I used an ibuprofen cream, which helped! That and lots of hot baths in the evenings!

But as most of you know I start my new job tomorrow.  Well I had a mini meltdown this morning as I looked through the post that I had left on the side and found I had received an appointment through for my first appointment with my new Oncologist! It's on the 17th Jan! Now luckily it's a 9am appointment and the hospital is very near where I work! Now assuming things run to time (miracles sometimes happen) I should be able to get to work just a little bit late....I start at 10, so in the perfect world I might even be on time!  But as I wanted to start out on the right foot, I decided I should contact my boss and let her know about the appointment and offer to work later if it was okay for me to come in a little later that day....or Offer to take it as annual leave! I had a little cry (silly I know) as I just had visions of this being exactly like last time Once I had calmed down and sorted myself out I called her........she listened to what I said and said \"no problem I'm not going away that week so I will be here, so come over as soon as you are finished, no need to work later or take time off\"!! I just thanked her, said see you tomorrow and then came off the phone and burst into tears!  I think I've found my perfect job, with a kind and understanding family. Could 2017 really be the year I get some sort of 'normal' life back  I hope so, I really do! Xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Hun, that feeling will pass. It just takes time. I think it's at times like this that we allow ourselves to think about what we have been through. Just going back to the hospital brings back a lot of memories that we 'think' we have dealt with, but the truth is while going through everything, we didn't have time to process anything. So for some of us it's weeks, months or even years before we really stop and see what we have just been through. I know for me, when I went back to the same clinic for my annual mammogram I was overcome with emotion. Suddenly I was back to where this whole nightmare had begun. I could remember how nervous I was on that day, how I sat telling myself it would be fine, I would be okay! After going through diagnosis, Surgery x2, chemo and radiotherapy with virtually no tears. The day I left that clinic after just a simple annual mammogram, I was in pieces! All those tears that I had unknowingly been keeping locked away inside suddenly gushed out!  BUT... Those feelings soon passed, each day I felt a little better about things, I slowly processed things and eventually stopped thinking about them as I was too busy trying to get on with life! However, every time I have gone back for annual mammograms I am taken right back to those feelings, the what ifs come back with a vengeance! But I think that's only natural. So what you are feeling will pass, it's perfectly normal and just takes time. So be kind to yourself, allow yourself to process everything at a speed to suit you. Most of us have been there and totally understand. May I offer you a ((((((((supportive hug))))))))) Hope you managed to get some sleep and hopefully tomorrow will be a slightly calmer day xxxxxxx",

      "Content": "toxophilite PS Constipation - have you tried (if you can) very large doses of Vit C? Increase the dose till you get diarohea, then reduce it slightly. 8000mg a day for me when on steroids. Haven't tried that, my problem is I don't go for anything up to 7/8/9 days, then I get major stomach cramps and the explosive diarreah! (Sorry if to much detail) The tablets the GP gave me helped in that the cramps stopped and I was beginning to go regularly. But then I had a couple of nights of diarreah so I reduced the dose, stupid?! I now haven't been for 4 days and counting! Since Chemo and taking these drugs my bowels have been a nightmare, maybe the lack of eostrogen plays a part too? I don't know! Something else to sort out at some point!  Think I might need to write down all my issues for my new oncologist! Start as I mean to go on   Thanks for all the advice, I will give anything a go! I know the pain is due to becoming more active, and lifting the baby, so hoping I will build up strength, but just need to sort the pain for now! Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn and Carolyn, I think you are both right it's time to talk to the experts about the pain. I suppose I have relied on the GP because my London team would never listen. I would say I'm struggling with pain and they would say keep up with the painkillers the GP gives you.....not much use at all. So perhaps seeing the new team I might actually find something that works. I would prefer to take something stronger, rather than milder drugs but more of them! I am basically taking something every 2 hours throu the day, which is ridiculous!  As for the bowels, the tablets I am on are, docusate think that's the spelling. I take 2 a day, but still have had no 'output', since reducing the dose for a few days  But I'm not sure I should be on them long term! Will have to try extra fruit, although I already eat plenty!  I think between damage caused during chemo and all the drug side effects, my bowels have forgotten what they are supposed to do!  Right I am off to 'The Room' I need to let off steam! Hope you are both having a nice weekend! Xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, need to pick your brains. Having just finished a full week at work I am struggling a bit with pain control. My sternum, breast and back are really aching and hurting, even though I am taking Parecetamol and Naproxen through the day and Tramadol and Amitriptyline at night.  I know it's because I'm doing more than I was, but then I can't do less it's my job and I love it. But slightly worried if I mention it to the GP she will just say, take it easy at work and don't over do it. I'm only doing what I have to do, definitly not over doing it!  So my question is do I discuss this with my Oncologist on Tuesday or continue to try and work it out with my GP? Also anyone else have any ideas on helping with pain? I always have a long soak in the bath every evening, I was using a heat pad, but that brings on flushes, so can't use that! Am desperate to get more sleep and to be pain free for a bit, while still being able to work....am I asking too much? Xx",

I went through surgery x2, Chemo, Radiotherapy and Hormone Therapy. So in theory giving myself the best possible chance of beating this disease. 18months after the end of all the treatment, I was diagnosed with secondary cancer to the Bone. I know I did everything I was told to give myself the best chance, and it still came back. Mine had spread to lymph nodes, so different to you. I think you have to decide if you can live with the 'what ifs' if you don't have Chemo and it comes back! Will you see yourself as one of the unlucky ones, or will you blame yourself for not having the Chemo?!  There is no right or wrong answer in this. It's finding the answer you can live with. I think if you're genuinely not sure the Oncotype DX test could give you a more informed decision! Whatever you decide I wish you all the best. Take Care xxx",

      "Content": "For the first time in 3.5years! After a restless night, with my head going round and round in circles I decided to email my BCN before I left for work, if nothing else it would hopefully clear my head and I would be able to see how contactable she is! Well I returned home to a reply! I was VERY impressed. Not only did she reply to my message, she had already spoken to the Oncologist and checked out a mammogram appointment for me! I was and still am grinning from ear to ear My email was to tell her that I was struggling with the thought of starting any new treatments at the moment, having just started work and on the whole feeling human, albeit knackered! Yes I have pain issues, sleep issues and toilet issues. But all of the treatments on offer would add to these (possibly) not help them.  So I asked if it would be possible to stick with being scanned regularly and IF and when something changed, like the Cancer woke from its nap, could I start on the treatments then? Or in a few months if I felt I was ready to start at some point. She replied to say that was fine, oncologist said they were all treatment options, available to me if I wanted them, well not want, but you know what I mean. The fact I felt a weight had been lifted when I read this email, told me that I am just NOT ready to have anymore treatment at this time. My view is, the mets are contained in the one place, they are currently napping and hopefully will stay that way while I'm on the Zoladex. Even if they wake up in the next year or next few months, at least I will of had time to get used to the idea, I would of had a few months (hopefully longer) of feeling in control again. Of feeling that cancer was on the back burner for a while! I don't know if this is the correct decision, but it's the right one for me at this moment in time. If I had a crystal ball, maybe my decision would be easier, but as I haven't I will make do with going with my gut feeling, which is that I finally feel someone is listening to me, and that is worth a huge amount.......I Think moving hospitals could really be the kick I needed to stand up for myself, it is MY life after all  xxx",

It\u2019s just off of Nottinghill. The staff in there at the time were amazing. I had booked an appointment and the lady I saw was kind and patient, nothing was too much trouble.  I believe they even run support groups for people who are dealing with hair loss for whatever reason. They had a great selection of wigs and were full of advice. So might be worth a look. But like I said it was 6years ago that I used them!  Just one other thought, you might want to check with your Oncologist about swimming in a public pool while on Chemo! I know I recall mine saying best to avoid them especially on the week that your immune system will be at its lowest! But maybe the current view is different!  Hope that helps and good luck with the wig fitting and your upcoming treatment. Take Care. Sal xxx",

No need to apologise for 'offloading', as that's exactly what this site is for. There is nothing you can say that won't of been said before by numerous other people! We have all been where you are, the worry, the fear and the feeling of isolation as it feels like no one understands. But we do Hun, we really do! The Lymph nodes are there to hopefully stop the cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body, so try not to panic. Many ladies have positive lymph nodes like you but go on to find the rest of the nodes and the scans are clear!  At the moment concentrate on what you do know, which is that you face more surgery to get the clear margins. Not what anyone wants to hear, but you can do it Hun. No you don't have to be 'brave' none of us are brave, we are just coping the best way we can, after all, what choice do we have?!  If you want to cry, cry! If you need to shout and get angry do! This journey will be full of emotions. You will have up and down days throughout. But the one thing I can guarantee you, is that you are not alone. There will always be someone here to offer you advice, support or just a shoulder to lean on! We share tears, we share laughter and we definitely share hope! Things have come a long way since your mum sadly passed away. So please don't lose hope. There are many treatment options available. We are all here to help you through each stage! So I think I have babbled on enough, especially as I should be sleeping! But that shows there is always someone around, day of night  I hope this helps a little and if nothing else, reassures you that you are not alone and that how you are feeling is perfectly normal!

I'm sure your family would rather have weeks/months or years with you, than a pile of money! It's now just you that has to realise you are worth this, you deserve to be with your family as long as you can, but you also need to use the time wisely. I know it must be hard, but make the most of this time, enjoy every minute that you can, show your family how much they mean to you, you might not leave them money, but in years to come they will be able to look back and remember the time and effort you put in to making special memories for them!  Your love for them, and them for you is worth more than any amount of money!  You're entitled to hate all those things except yourself......BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG.....YOU DID NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE CANCER......YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS.......BUT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE.......BECAUSE YOU ARE A WONDERFUL LOVING AND CARING PERSON WITH A BEAUTIFUL HEART.

      "Content": "So today I finally heard back from the surgeons secretary and it appears I was right, the mammogram was an error, he had requested one for June  not Jan!! Very pleased about this, as my breasts are so tender at the moment! Anyone have advice on how to deal with swollen sore breasts? I know one breast is down to Lymphoedema, so I gently massage that, but the other one seems to be swelling and I have an area that every so often feels like it's burning inside, sorry tricky to explain. I was wondering if it could be from my sternal surgery. As the insicion was under my breast and I assume they moved both breasts up, since then I have had no feeling in either breast, I'm wondering if this could be the nerves knitting together? Any thoughts? I did mention it to Oncologist, but obviously at that point he thought I was having a mammogram soon so didn't have much to say on the subject....not his area of expertise I suppose!  Anyway just wondered if anyone else had any great ideas on helping with swollen breasts? Is heat best or cold?  Other than that, work is great, bosses are amazing and all is looking good I finally feel things are going in the right direction! ",

I only ask because if your Cancer was Hormone Positive, then Tamoxifen or one of the other drugs, if you are post menopausal would offer better protection against a recurrence than Chemo would! If I was in your shoes I would be really pleased that I had dodged the Chemo bullet. I certainly don't think I would put my body through it unless my doctors thought it was really needed! I'm not really sure why this has been left as your decision? Surely your surgeon/oncologist has decided whether or not it is required? Obviously only you know what is right for you, but as someone who is still living with the side effects of chemo 4 years on, I would say IF you don't need it! Count your lucky stars and start getting on with your life again! I know it's hard and scary, but you will get there! It just takes time. Sending you a (((((((((((Supportive Hug))))))))))) xxxxxx",

No I haven't spoke to anyone but am lucky to have a lovely hubby and children  Hi, sadly there are no guarantees in all this. There are people with no node involvement who go on to have a secondary diagnosis and some people with lots of nodes involved who go on for many many years with NED. All you can do is have the treatment that is on offer and live your life knowing that whatever happens in the future, you gave yourself the best chance. He's not saying it won't work, he's just giving you the information, although when you are already feeling low, it's the last thing you need to hear. But I suppose you have to question how you would feel if he led you to believe the chemo would cure you and in a year or two it returned?! I've been there Hun, and it's not a good place to be!

Some of the 'issues' I mentioned to the hospice nurse and Oncologist 'COULD' be related to one of the pain meds and yet neither of them mentioned this. Instead the hospice nurse suggested changing to a stronger med in the same family of drugs and the Oncologist asked about my 'issues' and then brushed them neatly under the table! What is the point of having these drugs and lists of side effects, if medical staff aren't willing to to listen to the patient when they mention the problems they are having?!

When you feel like you are carrying a time bomb round with you.  I can't stop you feeling like this but I can tell you that you WON'T feel like this forever. It takes time but eventually you will put this behind you, you will never forget and there will be appointments and anniversaries that bring back these thoughts. But you will be happy again and you will be the life and soul of the party again! Just not this time!  Allow yourself time to grieve for the life you had, then you will start to embrace the life you have now. It's not easy and believe me it can take a long time. But one day you will wake up and not think about Cancer for a whole morning! Then for a whole day! Then without realising it you will go for a few days without letting it be in your every thought! It might not feel like it now. But 2018 is the year you will get your life back, because 2017 was the year you went through hell to kick Cancers Butt!  Wishing you a great 2018, I hope it brings lots of fun and laughter to you and your family.

I had pain from my jaw to my toes which came as a bit of a shock as I had breezed through FEC. But on my 2nd dose I was prepared and given better pain relief and so it was easier. Also tastebuds totally dissapeared, nothing tasted nice.....not even chocolate!!! But it returned not long after treatment ended I also suffered with tingling/loss of feeling in fingers and very sore feet, but again it sorted itself out eventually after the chemo finished. But any issues you have please mention to your oncologist as they can sometimes reduce the dose, which can help. The other side effect from the steroids you take before and after the chemo can be not being able to sleep! I never had this issue, although have had sleeping issues constantly since finishing treatment....work that out! Tax wasn't pleasant but then none of it is, but you will get through it! Just 3 to go, you are nearly there Hun. Keep going! Listen to your body, rest when you need to and spoil yourself when you feel up to it! Wishing you all the best XXXX",

May I start by offering you a welcome...... Hug! Because at times like this you can never have enough hugs! Now how to help you feel a little less overloaded! Well now you have read all the information you can put it to one side and concentrate on getting ready for your holiday! Where are you off too? Breast Cancer doesn't spread that quickly, hence the reason they are letting you have your holiday! I know that this diagnosis is going to be on your mind, obviously. But try and allow yourself to enjoy your break. Then when you get back it'll be time to concentrate on getting through the next few months of treatment! Once the treatment begins its best to take things a day at a time! Not sure if you have been told what treatment you are having yet, but whichever order it goes in just concentrate on it one step at a time. If you think about everything all at once it really is overwhelming! As for crying.......well that's a good thing! You've been given some life changing Cr@ppy news of course you are going to be emotional. In fact over the coming months you are likely to go through a whole host of emotions! All of which are fine to feel so don't try and hold them in, just be kind to yourself and allow yourself to feel how you need to feel. Remember though that you are not alone. We are all here for you. Day or night there will be someone on here to offer advice, support or a virtual hug!  If there is anything you would like to ask about the Cancer or the treatment, then do ask! There will probably be someone who has answers to your questions! Above all else, remind yourself that having Breast Cancer is rubbish, BUT it's not the end of the world. You WILL get through the coming months! Yes it will be a tough few months, but we'll be with you every step of the way! IF you want us too! Hope that helps a little! Oh and may I pass a packet of virtual tissues, to help mop up those tears! You are going to be okay Hun. Sal xxxxxxxx",

My Oncologist told me I was likely to have a 'bleed' approx 2 weeks after my first injection and then my periods should stop!

No night sweats and no hot flushes! Which is great but can't help feeling that means the injections aren't doing what they are supposed to be doing. I was on Tamoxifen for about 18months and the hot flushes were unbearable, so was expecting at least some flushes from this drug. Has anyone else on this injection continued with periods? I'm wondering if my body is still getting used to it, and that by next month I'll be back on moaning about hot flushes ;-) I will contact my BCN tomorrow and mention it, but just wondered if any one else had had the same reaction?

Losing hair, through no choice of your own is VERY different to doing it to make money for charity. I am very grateful to everyone who helps raise money for Charity, but I do think there are better ways of doing it. I hated losing my hair back in 2013/2014 but having my sisters or mum offering to shave their hair too, would not of helped support me in any way! I think it's very difficult for charities to find ways of advertising and supporting without upsetting someone. So I suppose we have to learn to take a deep breath and look at the bigger picture. Which is they are making money for a very good cause. I for one hate the breast cancer month in October, when every time you switch on the TV/radio there is an advert about beating breast cancer and how we will win the fight etc etc. Breast Cancer is portrayed as something Pink and Fluffy!! Well it's not either of those to me, it's a disease that took away the life I enjoyed and loved. In return it has given me a life of uncertainty, full of treatment that I don't like or enjoy! But that I have to endure, if I want to keep living as long as I can. Not so Pink and Fluffy!!  Thanks for starting this post and being so honest, I think there are a lot of women who share these views, but are too worried to say anything, as we all know at the end of the day they are doing this for a good cause!  I personally enjoyed doing the Macmillans Night In, a chance to get together with friends and family and Celebrate Life  and just have a good time, while making money for a great cause!

Could I ask, do you plan on shaving your head continually throughout your friends treatment? As her hair will fall out, approx 2 weeks after her first Chemo! It won't grow back for months......yours will start to grow back immediately! How does she feel about this? I know after treatment when I first went to get my hair, what little there was, coloured. I was surrounded by women with beautiful long hair, and I was so jealous. I personally would hate for a family member or friend to shave their hair off for me! But I would find it even harder to go through treatment looking and feeling worse each day, while my friend had hair growing back! I don't doubt for one minute that you are a wonderful friend, the fact you are asking the question shows that.....BUT....I would just make sure your friend feels okay, REALLY okay with you doing this! Wishing you all the best with whatever you decide, sending lots of love and positive vibes to your friend. Xx",

I think for most of us when we get the Cancer diagnosis, we think about death and then we think about losing our hair! It tends to be one of the biggest fears! So I find it really odd that she would choose this as a way to raise money! Now I obviously don't know the person and I am only speaking for myself, but I can't help wondering if she is doing it for the attention as well as making money?! Sorry if that sounds cruel. But I would question why someone who has been through Cancer would want to do this? If it was a man I wouldn't think so much of it. Maybe it's just me who thinks its weird for women to do this out of choice! But maybe some women don't think about their hair in the same way. As for whether you give money. That's up to you, but personally I would rather go and put the money in a collection tin, than support someone doing this. Xx",

I was never a pill popper, but when the Tax truck hit, I was open to anything on offer! Soaking in a hot bath helped too. The taste buds for me, sadly stayed away for the entire time I was having Tax, everything tasted slimey?! It was odd. But they do return after its all over! I kept to simple foods and strangely enough foods like porridge and rice pudding were the best as they were meant to be 'slimey' feeling in the mouth.....if that makes sense? I also found sucking on sweets helped, not great for your teeth but that's life!  Oh and I found water was difficult to drink, I preferred adding some sort of flavour to it.

But I will say that this is an important decision and not one that you should be making, in my opinion! They are the experts and they should be telling you which option will give you the best chance of long term cancer free survival. The two types of drugs are very different which is why one is suited to pre menopausal women and the other to post! I wonder if you were offered Tamoxifen with Zoladex? As this could also be an option?! I don't envy your decision! Xxx",

On that subject let's start off with a BIG WELCOME..... HUG! Because if there's one thing you will need on the upcoming journey it's lots of hugs. So, on to the serious stuff. Firstly may I reassure you that we have ALL been where you are right now and it's a VERY scary place to be! HOWEVER, it does get easier and things WILL calm down. Once you have a treatment plan to focus on you will start to feel slightly less anxious. The journey you are about to embark on isn't easy, isn't fun BUT it is however VERY VERY DOABLE and with the help and support of family, friends and us lot on here you will get through this Hun.  Now to try and reassure you that you won't be leaving your children for a long while yet! Breast Cancer is very treatable obviously depending on the type you have, will depend on what treatment you are offered. But whatever the test results are Hun there will be a treatment option. Even IF you were to be found with Secondary Cancer (which hopefully you won't) IT IS STILL VERY MUCH TREATABLE, and you should be here with your children for a long time yet! Now there is nothing you can do now other than to sit and wait for the results. But PLEASE stop asking Dr Google for his advice as he really is useless! Everything is out of date and it's all very much doom and gloom! While you are in these early stages and already feeling anxious and scared, stick with us! If there is anything you need to ask or if you just need a rant, go for it! There will ALWAYS be someone to help advise, support or offer a virtual hug both day and night! None of us can take away your fear, but we can promise you that we are all here for you and you will never be alone. I hope that helps a little. It's always difficult to know what to say because obviously nothing we can say will take away the fear and pain you are feeling right now! But when you look at your boys today, don't think about how they will cope without you, instead think about how you will show them how much you love them and that you will do everything within your power to get through the next few months, so you can be with them for many many years to come! They need you Hun as much as you need them right now! Together you WILL get through this! Take Care Hun, I look forward to getting to know you more over the coming weeks and months. Sal xxxxxx",

However the T part is very different and I know a few ladies who struggled like you on FEC and absolutely breezed through the T part! I however was the other way around, was fine on FEC and struggled with joint/bone pain on T. What I am trying to say is don't you think it's worth giving it a go? See how you get on? No one can force you but it seems a little counterproductive to stop before you know how it will affect you, especially as you have managed to get through 3 FEC, which shows that you are stronger and more determined than you give your credit for. You have done amazingly well. Now I will just offer you a MASSIVE........ HUG. Because I think you deserve it and it sounds like you could do with one. Only you can make the decision, but I really hope you give T a try before you decide. I know it's tough but please make sure you make the decision based on facts and not fear!  Wishing you all the best Sal xxxx",

I thought mine had settled a while back, but in the last month my scar around my nipple has began to pull inwards and yesterday I noticed another area that is pulling inwards when I move my arms (I was shaving pits at the time) I don't spend all day checking out my boobs Anyway my 'logical' head says it's just the scar tissue/radiotherapy. I only had my Mammogram in June and a PET CT in August, so hopefully it can't be anything sinister. But I am so fed up of things constantly changing. They tell you to keep an eye and report any changes....well going on that theory I'd be calling them every week! I am currently on Zoladex injections so wonder if that is affecting my breast, also had surgery on my sternum back at the end of Feb so I suppose that might of created more scar tissue! Just wondered if anyone else has had the same issues and if things settled......eventually. ",

I think it's very easy to be drawn into the habit of blaming every ache and pain on the Chemo or Radiotherapy. But just because we have had Cancer that doesn't make us immune from other illnesses and health issues. I think it's probably worth a chat with your GP just to see if it could be related to anything else. Hope you find out what's causing it and a solution to the problem soon. Good Luck. Sal x",

I wasn't sure if if I could use the ibuprofen gel while taking all the pain meds I am on, but will check with the pharmacy today! No I don't know what's causing it, I thought it might just be from lifting the baby at work, but it oddly doesn't hurt while lifting, carrying, bending etc.....it's just when I sit still or lie down and worse in the evenings/night! But still aching this morning! I have an appointment with Oncologist on Wednesday and am due a scan soon, so obviously am hoping it is just a 'normal' backache and nothing more sinister. Although can't work out why the pain meds aren't sorting it....I take enough of them! Xx",

The top dogs seem out of bounds....unless you have an appointment with them!  The theory being the BCN will pass on any concerns you have.....sadly the info doesn't always get through!

Now we have a second 2000 piece one on the go. It's definitely a way of using up time, rather than sitting watching tv! Although Dad normally has that on in the background. I used to be able to do 1000 piece jigsaw in one day, if it was one with clear coloured sections. Like some of the Wasgij ones. Now they take me a couple of days. Depending on how long I can stay interested in them!  Looking forward to seeing what else you lovely talented ladies come up with! Xxx",

      "Content": "I think we can probably all agree that the hospitals system with dealing with results really does need looking at. Although I would question whether your BCN was being dishonest in telling you you would receive the results over the phone. I know from experience that they don't like to do that....although I don't know why. I had a CT scan a while back, it was following a bone scan which showed a lesion in my sternum. They wanted to check that there was nothing else going on. So for me quite a worrying time. It took 3 weeks to get the results, even though the results would of been available after a week. This was due to the Oncologist being away and my BCN being away and the report needed to be discussed at the MDT before they could give results. I lasted 2 weeks before calling the general BCN line and requesting that someone tell me the results. No one called back. Finally I got hold of me BCN and after lots of tears and getting angry and explaining it was driving me nuts, she finally said \"it's all clear, except for the sternum area\"! When I asked why I couldn't of been told that weeks ago, she said because they aren't allowed to give results over the phone without the Oncologists go ahead. Ridiculous! So I wonder whether your BCN said that to appease you, then left the other nurses to deal with the back lash. Having said that, as she has said you can have results over the phone, I think they now need to do that.  Good Luck today I hope you get some answers. Xx",

Are you on any hormone therapy, as I am and that is what is and has caused all my issues! I am currently trying out different painkillers to try and sort things out, but haven't solved the problem yet! (Although I have more issues now, so yours may be easier to solve) don't want to scare you! Only advice I can give is that you need to mention your concerns to your Oncologist/surgeon which ever you are seeing, once they are sure it's just nerve/healing pains, start looking at medication to help sort it. I tried so hard to 'cope' and 'ignore' things, but I really wish now I had just taken painkillers from the start, as it never improved and i was constantly told it would get better, so kept waiting another few months. Meanwhile I wasn't sleeping (still an issue) was constantly unhappy and ended up not feeling capable of working  life became one huge effort. Please seek help now and don't think you have to just put up with this, as my GP told me the other day, no one should be in pain when we have so many medications to help.  Good luck with everything, keep sharing, always happy to listen xxx",

      "Content": "Hi suzie02, I assume you have only been on Tamoxifen for a few months? So firstly can I suggest you try a different brand! My hot flushes were every 30mins day and night while taking a couple of the brands, but on one brand I was only having them every so often! So definitely worth trying to find a brand that suits you. I also tried a menopause magnet, which did help! But not sure how?! As for my other issues, that's NOT Tamoxifen based which is why I didn't mention it as I didn't want to worry/panic you. I was on Tamoxifen for 18months and it didn't completely work for me. So now I am on Zoladex injections. Which sadly have the same cr*ppy side effects, but if i don't have the injections I will have to have surgery to remove my ovaries and then probably be put on a different drug  So have decided to stick with this a big longer! All I can say is Tamoxifen made my life a misery and I was ready to give up after about 6 months! My Oncologist said if I could last out for at least 2 years he would of been happy. At 18months I was going to stop but the decision was made for me, as I was found to have one area of bone mets in my sternum. Although I was angry that I had wasted 18months of my life feeling cr*p I was pleased that I had stuck it out, as IF I had given up at 6 months and then discovered the bone mets, 1) there could of been more spread and 2)I would of blamed myself for stopping the Tamoxifen...and that would of been tough to live with! This drug is an amazing drug and it works for most people, but you don't need to suffer. All I can say is be TOTALLY honest with your Oncologist. List down all your issues, don't get fobbed off with things will improve, because yes they might....but right now you need help and support to deal with them! Having said that it's still very early days for you and so you might find things settle. So don't be too disheartened, be kind to yourself you have been through a lot! I hope I haven't said too much, or scared you! Because that's the last thing I wanted to do! Xx",

In answer to your question, yes I am now classed as stage 4, which is pretty cr*p but not the end of the world.....or so people keep telling me. But it does mean I can't stop treatment now, so I have to learn to live with my side effects. So although I have NEVER been a pill popper, I am now willing to try anything that might give me some quality of life! It's alright people saying ladies with just bone mets can live for years, but what's the point if you aren't happy! Anyway if you want to find 'love' or a companion I am sure the right person is out there somewhere! You are still you, you are entitled to find the love and support you want and need. The right person will understand and love you for who you are!  so please don't give up! As for the bone pain, I still have painful ribs, it was almost definitely down to the Radiotherapy or age (but I'm only 41) The bone scan and PET CT were clear. So I can at least reassure you that having these pains although annoying can be nothing serious! Bone scans are very good at picking up bone mets! So if it was clear that is a good thing. As for tamoxifen brands, there are at least 3! Well that I tried. So definitely give them all a go and find the least annoying! Feel free to PM me any time, I know how rough this is and am happy to listen  don't try and do this alone. We are all here to support each other! Xx",

If you feel knowing it's the tamoxifen causing the issues but your taking it to prevent recurrance, so that gives you the push you need to continue, great!  I lasted 18 months the last 6 months of that I cried every night and struggled to get through the day. I'm on Zoladex injections now, and am having the same sort of side effects! So this time I am taking other drugs to try and settle the side effects. My body clearly loves Estrogen and isn't happy about it not being there! I think changing to letrazole will 'probably' have the same side effects or maybe worse? OR maybe it will suit you better, you won't know until you try?!  Could let you try it for a couple of months? See how you go? Although must admit the idea of bone thinning would scare me, as the one plus on tamoxifen is it doesn't affect the bones, in a negative way! Sorry I've not been much help! But wanted you to know you weren't alone in tamoxifen affecting your mood and general feeling of grottiness! Hope you make a decision that suits you. Xxxx",

As it had been a year since my last period, they did an internal can to check things out! I had thickening to the womb lining, which then needed investigating. I had a hysteroscopy, which showed fibroids and cysts. They took biopsies of the womb lining. Everything was clear and was put down to Tamoxifen side effects.  I think the problem with Tamoxifen is that no one seems to agree on whether or not it has any affect on your periods. I was told by the Oncologist that Tamoxifen puts you into early menopause, and in the same week told by the Gynaecologist that it doesn't?! Work that out?! Sorry that doesn't really help you, but just wanted to share and let you know you aren't alone!  I'm on Zoladex now, which has put me into drug induced menopause, but even on that I still have weeks where I feel like I'm going to have a period, it's weird!

As Gay says some nurses are better than others! My first injection about 20months ago was given at the hospital and I didn't feel a thing.....so cocky me went away thinking, wow what an easy treatment great I can cope with this! Next injection at the GP surgery.......OH MY GOOD GOD, I almost jumped off the couch, brought tears to my eyes would be an understatement! But since then she's got better and better!  I have my injection every 3 weeks, so I've given my nurse lots a practice! Now we chat and laugh about it and I find it okay! Yes I have had a couple that have REALLY hurt! But then it's over with for another few weeks! I come on here I moan I say I can't do it and I never want to go back and 3 weeks later I am lying on the couch getting the jab! The more you relax the easier it is! Slow deep breathes and think of something nice! But If you are really concerned then definitly try the cream! Wishing you all the best, remember we are here if you need us.

So in answer to the question I replied; I'm doing well Thanks, looking forward to Christmas and then starting my new job in Jan, health wise things are stable, so yes pretty good! Now I have had the gentle hand to the shoulder, tilted head and responses ranging from, Really? Are you sure? I'm here if you need to talk! Or Well things will never be quite the same will they? Or the real belter of a response, but it must be hard trying to smile when you are dealing with the big C! So am I wrong to be genuinely feeling okay about things? Yes I have off days, but on the whole I feel pretty good! Yes I have aches and pains and can't sleep, but I try not to let that effect me. These people have made me think I should be facing the fact the end is near....so I should be concentrating on having fun, while I can!! I'm sure the end is a LONG LONG LONG way off, so am more than happy to take each day as it comes and to get on with living a normal life. Which for me involves going back to do the job I love and to have fun, but in the same way everyone else does, book a holiday if and when I want to. Not because I'm not sure how many I have left! I don't want or need a 'bucket list' as the way treatment is changing all the time and the fact my Cancer is stable, to me means I have plenty of time to do everything I want. For now I just want 'normality' a little bit of Hospital appointment anxiety and scan results anxiety thrown in every few months, but on the whole I am and I want to be 'normal'.......might seem boring to some, but after the last few years, 'normal' is good In the last few days I have ended up feeling like everyone around me seems to think I'm not facing reality......which in their eyes seems that having secondary cancer is the end of the world! I admit it's no picnic in the park, but it's certainly not the end of the world. But after all the 'looks' and 'comments' I wondered if I was missing something!! So long as I don't step in front of a bus any time soon, I think I can safely assume I'm still going to be around to annoy them next Christmas!! Or at least I hope I will  xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi, just wondered if anyone else has experienced their treated breast changing colour? Yes I know that sounds weird and it's difficult to explain. For the last few months I have noticed that the left hand side of my left breast (treated 2013) has an area that is a sort of purple/blue colour! I thought to begin with it was because it was cold, but even when I massage it that area stays a weird colour. To begin with it was just a small area, but in the last few weeks it's become more noticeable as the area has got larger! Could still be down to the cold weather?! I had a mammogram in June which was clear, a PET CT a few weeks ago which was fine and a breast ultrasound a couple of months ago.  So I'm not overly worried but am concerned that this breast is just getting weirder and weirder. I do have Lymphoedema on that side which affects my breast as well as my arm, so maybe it's that?  But just wondered if anyone else had experienced the same or something like it! ",

I had Chemo, as the cancer had reached my Lymph Nodes. BUT just 2.5yrs later the Cancer was found in my sternum! It wasn't there on the bone scan I had before I started Chemo. So it grew either after Chemo or during?! Either way the Chemo didn't prevent my spread. Obviously it may have prevented it getting anywhere else, who knows!  But the side effects of Chemo can be long lasting and with no node involvement I would be inclined to NOT have Chemo, if you are happy to do that. Worse case scenario IF it did return you would still have Chemo as a treatment option! You have to do what feels right for you. Good Luck xxx",

I assume you had radiotherapy the first time round?  The more information I read the more I believe Chemo isn't so important for ER+ BC, at least not when it is contained in the breast! I think I would question you more if you were questioning whether or not to continue with hormone therapy! Go with your heart Hun, do what feels right for you.

      "Content": "Hi Hun, firstly i totally understand your anger/frustration at what you are going through. But wanted to reassure you that your surgeon wasn't lying to you. They were going on the information they had, which would of been the mammogram and ultrasound reports/pics! Which can only give them so much information. It's not until they operate that they can really see the extent of what's happening inside. It's very possible for one cancer to hide behind another! Then it's only through testing the tissue removed that they can see whether or not they had clear margins. It's not like cancer cells stand out from normal looking cells, especially when they are just starting out! I can empathise with how you feel. I had bone mets discovered in my sternum. As this was the only area of spread my oncologist suggested surgery to remove the area of bone! Which in theory will leave me NED no evidence of disease. So I went for it, a long surgery, painful recovery and 2 weeks later told they didn't get clear margins :-( my cancer was still there and still active! So all that pain for nothing!!! But it was worth a try! I'm sure those surgeons were disappointed that they didn't get it all, as were yours! But they have to weigh up the pros and cons of removing enough tissue without removing too much healthy tissue! Sorry that was so long winded, hope it made sense. Wishing you all the best for your mastectomy. Hopefully it's the last surgery you will need for awhile ...... (((((((((((Supportive and understanding hugs)))))))))))) xxxxxxxxxx",

I went from being told Surgery and Radiotherapy would be required. To surgery, chemo and node removal surgery would be required!  I spoke with my BCN and explained that I needed to be given ALL the information, this first became an issue when I received a copy of the letter that gets sent to my GP in it was more information than had been discussed at my appointment. I was angry and confused and started to lose trust in the people who were treating me. I then had a bone scan 2 years after my first one. On it my sternum lit up! My oncologist said he wasn't overly concerned and was happy to leave it and look again at the next scan in 3 months! Once discussed at the MDT it was decided it needed investigating and of course as I had already worked out for myself it was bone mets! But it took from Nov 2015 to Feb 2016 for them to finally admit it was bone mets! Up to then they tried to placate me with, it might not be, it might be an old injury etc etc......I knew deep down it was mets but they just seemed to pussy foot around, somehow thinking this would help me!  I'm more of a give me the worse case scenario so I can be prepared person, I know that doesn't suit everyone. But I do think Oncologists or our BCN's have to treat us as individuals and ask us how much information we would like! So I totally get where you are coming from and all I can suggest is you try and get them to understand how you want to be treated, how you need the information and you are more than capable of dealing with it! Now may I offer you an Understanding........ Take Care Hun, hope things start to settle for you xxxxxxx",

They say there's no evidence to suggest it does increase your lymphoedema risk. No doubt your physio will be practicing good hygiene and sterile conditions so the risk is very very low. I would say though that cortisone isn't known for being great as a one off and it will take many shots to be effective. love Julia x  Hi Julia, I recall you mentioning this on another post. But just wanted to add, one of the ladies on the secondary group, recently went through Chemo and had a PICC line in her unaffected arm. So she needed blood pressure to be taken on the arm where nodes had been removed. She has now developed Lymphoedema in that arm.......coincident? Or down to Cancer? Or chemo? I don't know. But I think if it was me, I would still opt to use the unaffected side for blood pressure and blood tests etc! xx",

I have worked as a nanny for years and the children have been left in my care, for anything up to a week while the parents were away on business.

You will have to explain to your little one that you are sore and to be careful, but the trick is to make sure you keep yourself protected, as we all know how little ones can appear from nowhere and always bump you where it hurts. So sitting at the table with her sat opposite or next to you, is always a good position. Remember you can still show your love and affection, just in different ways. As for pain, I didn't have that sort of surgery, but I'm sure they will give you plenty of pain relief, don't suffer in silence, they won't know you are in pain if you try to be brave!  Now try and keep busy for the next few days, spend some special time with your little one. It'll be you that misses all the hugs etc little ones nana and daddy will keep them happy   You are going through this so that you can have many many many more years with your little one, so please don't think you are doing something to emotionally hurt your child, because you aren't xxxxxx",

      "Content": "Hi hels, I'm sure there's a medical explanation to this. But just logically thinking, I think it's one of those questions where you would need to know, why do some people get breast cancer and some not? I suppose the fact you had it in one breast means their is an increased likely hood that you could get it in the other, compared to someone who has never had cancer. I suppose the positive is that you will be regularly checked, which prior to your first diagnosis you wouldn't of been.  I believe the chances of it appearing in the other breast drops down after 5 years of NED, to the same chance as anyone else getting breast cancer! I hope that made some sense?! Xxx",

Now how did I come to this conclusion, what made me realise that this was an issue.....hmmmmmmmm let's look at the evidence! 1) I gave a lovely baby fish pie to the works cat instead of the baby! 2) I made a cup of tea and didn't put the teabag in! 3) I made a cup of tea, with teabag.....but no water! 4) I ran a bath without putting the plug in! 5) I looked everywhere for my scarf......it was around my neck! 6) I plugged my phone in to charge, without plugging in charger! 7) I dressed as a super hero, putting my undies on the outside! (Error discovered before I left the bathroom, thankfully! Super Londonlass wasn't quite ready to come out to the world yet I'm sure I could come up with other examples, but I think this makes the point! So clearly I have issues, now I used to blame the Chemo, then I blamed the Tamoxifen, now it's lack of oestrogen and sleep......I suppose at some point I might have to admit that I am just a bit of a FRUIT LOOP  But if nothing else, although frustrating at the time it always gives me something to giggle about after the event, it also appears to make others smile and laugh.....so as we all know laughter is the best medicine, I thought I would share my 'mishaps' with you all.

But I just wanted to remind you that you are going through a huge, life changing experience right now and trying to cope with both the physical and mental challenges that this disease and it\u2019s treatments throw at you! So PLEASE don\u2019t be giving yourself a hard time because you aren\u2019t that active and fit person right now! At the moment your \u2018fit\u2019 body has been hit by the Chemo train and that is a huge shock for any body to deal with! But once you are through the Chemo and you are back to eating properly and slowly start to exercise again you will start to see glimpses of the \u2018old\u2019 you! So please don\u2019t think this is forever! This is just a moment in time and it will pass!! Although it is pretty shitty when you are living in that moment...... it DOES get better! Promise! Right now I think you just need reminding that you are doing great! If I was there I would offer you a supportive hug, but this will have to do..... Take care and just take things One day at a time!

I had bone pain from my jaw to my toes, it was awful. So I can fully empathise with how you feel. I was put on co-codamol which isn't quite as strong as Tramadol and I found it helped with my aches and pains. Keep going Hun, it'll soon be over! Xx",

So could be something that only lasts a short while for you too! I think at my worse I had 17 bruises on my thighs! Not a great look! Worth discussing with your oncologist or GP and to get your bloods checked, but it can be tamoxifen related. Hope that helps xxxx",

Hi mccaca, firstly thanks for the hugs which are always much appreciated.  I have been on endocrine treatment since March 2014! 20 months on Tamoxifen, then a break of 4 months while I went through tests and surgery for bone mets to my sternum. Then I began Zoladex injections in about April 2016! So my ovaries were shut down approx a year ago! My joints have gradually started to get worse and worse. My fingers and wrists are the worse, because I find it difficult to do everyday things. Today I couldn't open a bottle with a screw cap, not because the lid was on too tight, but because I couldn't bend my fingers enough to grip the lid! I just feel old before my time! But that's life and I know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I think it's something else I might have to discuss with my GP or Oncologist at my next appointment. Although I always sense that they are only interested in one thing, keeping the a Cancer stable, if they are doing that then in their eyes they are doing a great job and I should be very happy.....except......its me that's living with pain, discomfort and difficulties doing simple everyday tasks! I wish they would look at the bigger picture! But I'm not sure that's ever going to happen. Luckily I know I can always rely on the lovely ladies and gents on here to help me on my 'off' days and offer help and advice when I need it   Sadly I am not in your area, but I do appreciate your very kind offer  xxx",

It's only done on patients that are node negative BUT I am pretty sure when it's in just the sentinal node that's classed as negative! In fact I wonder why you were given a full clearance :-( I think some hospitals just do things differently. However I think it would be worth asking the question about the Oncotype test. As it could come back that Chemo wouldn't benefit you! Having Chemo just because of your age seems a bit like over treatment when they have tests available to help make a more informed decision!  Its just a thought, and I might be wrong about the sentinal node thing. But might be worth looking in to? I know I would want to know that Chemo was really necessary before I went through it.  I'm going to tag in Dreamthief, as he's the fountain of knowledge and will tell me if I am wrong but also give you more information if I am correct! I suppose the other question is what type of cancer you had I'm assuming it's ER+ and HER- otherwise Chemo is a must! Also whether you are based in the UK! Hope I haven't confused you too much!

      "Content": "mccaca Oh Londonlass, Big (but delicate) hugs, how long have you been on the endocrine treatment? Has it snuck up on you? Hi mccaca, firstly thanks for the hugs which are always much appreciated.  I have been on endocrine treatment since March 2014! 20 months on Tamoxifen, then a break of 4 months while I went through tests and surgery for bone mets to my sternum. Then I began Zoladex injections in about April 2016! So my ovaries were shut down approx a year ago! My joints have gradually started to get worse and worse. My fingers and wrists are the worse, because I find it difficult to do everyday things. Today I couldn't open a bottle with a screw cap, not because the lid was on too tight, but because I couldn't bend my fingers enough to grip the lid! I just feel old before my time! But that's life and I know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I think it's something else I might have to discuss with my GP or Oncologist at my next appointment. Although I always sense that they are only interested in one thing, keeping the a Cancer stable, if they are doing that then in their eyes they are doing a great job and I should be very happy.....except......its me that's living with pain, discomfort and difficulties doing simple everyday tasks! I wish they would look at the bigger picture! But I'm not sure that's ever going to happen. Luckily I know I can always rely on the lovely ladies and gents on here to help me on my 'off' days and offer help and advice when I need it   Sadly I am not in your area, but I do appreciate your very kind offer  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi mumof3, firstly Welcome! But sorry you have joined the club no one really wants to join. I think something you said might help you put all this in to perspective, \"when I found out I had BC I developed a pain in my back\" so it wasn't there before?  I recall when I was first diagnosed that with every ache and pain my brain went in to overdrive, clearly the cancer was running wild through my body.....obviously it wasn't!  Your cancer has been caught early and is slow growing, which are both good signs! It's highly likely your backache is just that, backache from over doing it or just getting older....I have had back ache on and off for years, but scans have shown its just wear and tear! I would keep up with over the counter pain relief and see how things go. IF in a few weeks things are worse or not improving then speak to your GP again and see if they will take a closer look.  In the next few weeks I'm sure you will notice every little ache and pain, but it's normal perfectly normal! Just remember one thing, you are currently Cancer free, No Evidence of Disease.....that's good, it might still feel you are in the cancer whirlwind, but you are through the surgery, which I hope went well for you, and the rads and tamoxifen will hopefully ensure it doesn't come back!  You've been through a big surgery, give yourself time to heal physically and mentally. It all takes time. But try not to over think everything. Back ache is very very common, it doesn't mean it's cancer related.  Hope that helps a little! Have a special (((((((((welcome hug)))))))) xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Breasty-besty , sorry to hear you are dealing with this extra worry! However I do think you need to bare in mind that doctors, particularly GP\u2019s will always air on the side of caution. I have had numerous scans and tests to \u2018rule out\u2019 mets, even when I myself was 99% sure it was down to other things!  Is it possible that the Herceptin is causing the headaches? Or blood pressure? Or stress? There are so many things it could be and in fact that it\u2019s more likely to be than Brain Mets!  Not sure if this will reassure you but I have Bone mets and when I have my 3/6 monthly scan they only scan from neck to knees! I would think that indicates that they feel Breast Cancer is more likely to spread to the main organs/bones before the brain! Obviously I can only talk from the point of someone with ER+ Breast Cancer! As for the wait for a scan IF the GP has marked it as urgent you should get a scan within the 2wk guide line, although this can vary from hospital to hospital. The same with results! Ideally you will hear within 2wks, although 3wks is more realistic in most hospitals! I know it\u2019s easy to say Don\u2019t Worry but worrying won\u2019t change anything it\u2019ll just make you more anxious and possibly increase the likelyhood of you having more headaches! Try and keep busy, do things that make you happy and don\u2019t over think things!  REMEMBER your GP is just being thorough! Good Luck Hun and let us know how you get on! Sal xx",

      "Content": "Hi Rach, sorry you are having a tough time with arm pain! Going on how you describe it, it sounds very much like cording! Now usually you can see or feel what looks like a cord inside your arm, hence the name. But I suppose it's possible to have a cord that is deeper down and therefore not visiable!  Lymphoedema doesn't tend to be painful, it's more of a heavy achy feeling in your arm and the swelling is quite noticeable.  Nerve pain tends to be stabbing pains or burning pains! So my guess would be cording and the best thing for it is stretching and massage, until the cords snap! Now it is possible to do this on your own sometimes BUT the fact you can't see or feel the cord isn't going to make that easy! So you need to contact your BCN explain that you think you have cording and she will arrange to see you and get an appointment with the Physio! Alternatively see your GP. But the sooner you get it seen to the better! I hope that helps a little! Sending you a (((((((((((gentle hug))))))))) Sal xxx",

It's something the children I used to look after did at school and I will never forget 2013 when the little girl I looked after gave her wish to me and wished.....that my best nanny gets her hair back in 2014 so I can share my hair clips with her  I shed a few tears on that day! So my 2 Thanks!! Thankyou to my family, friends and online friends who have stood by me over the last year. You have helped me laugh through the bad times (even though it hurt after surgery) shared smiles through the good times and given me a kick up the backside when I've needed it. Thankyou to Maggies online and Macmillan for helping me survive the year following my secondaries diagnosis. The help and advice has been amazing and I wouldn't of got through the year without you. I WISH that 2017 will be a more stable year for me, that I will settle in my new job and really start living again. A year full of genuine smiles and laughter!

      "Content": "Hi Brighty1, just wanted to say...... Really sorry that you find yourself here, especially as it seems you have had the year from hell. Sorry to read that you lost your mum, I\u2019m sure dealing with Cancer on top of grieving is REALLY difficult.  However you have done the right thing coming on here as there will always be someone on here to offer support, advice or just a listening ear, which we all need sometimes! There is also the helpline number that you can call if you want to speak to someone, or the ask a nurse section if you have a specific medical question. Although if you start a thread with a question I am sure there will be someone who can answer it! That\u2019s the amazing thing about this site, we all have different paths on this journey and therefore the chances are someone will be able to advise you! Of course your first place for advice should be your medical team, when they return from their holidays! I know that feeling well I swear my Breast Care Nurse seemed to be away on holiday each time I had a question to ask!! It was very frustrating but I used online support as a way to answer my questions while waiting for her to return! The greatest thing about online support is that there is usually someone around Day or Night! I started a thread called AWAKE, which began as a place to chat in the early hours when I couldn\u2019t sleep but as the time has gone on it\u2019s turned into a place where we put up funny/supportive pics and we have a laugh! I know right now you probably feel that there is nothing to laugh about. But believe me you will find your sense of humour again, you need too as it\u2019s much nicer to laugh when you can!! Feel free to pop on the AWAKE thread and say hello, you will be very welcome! Once you have started treatment there is a monthly Chemo thread and a monthly radiotherapy thread. But those you can learn about once you have a treatment plan in place! I promise you that once you know what the plan is you will feel a little bit more at ease! The next 12months won\u2019t be easy but they are doable. You learn very quickly who your true friends are and I would suggest that you accept any help that you are offered. Don\u2019t feel you have to do this alone, you don\u2019t get any awards for being \u2018strong\u2019 or \u2018brave\u2019! Be as open and honest as you can about how you feel and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help!  I have probably babbled on enough! Especially as I reallly just wanted to say Hi! But please use this site as much as you need to! Ask lots of questions or rant or enjoy making new friends. It won\u2019t be long before this site becomes part of you every day life. I for one have made some amazing life long friends! I hope you can too. Look forward to learning more about you. Stay in touch. Sal xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi Lou, well that sounds like CR*P news. Although I will add please don't assume the worse until you know for sure! There is a lady from this site who was diagnosed with mets to the liver following a CT scan. But when the scan was viewed by a liver doc he asked for more scans and eventually ruled it out as NOT cancer related. Now I am not saying that to give you false hope as that's the last thing I would do. But I am a great believer in making sure of the facts before worrying too much! Easier said than done I know!  Have you been scanned before? So they have another scan to compare It too? If so that's slightly different, although clearly they aren't 100% sure if they are going to biopsy! Now IF it does turn out to be Mets which makes you stage 4.....IT IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD...... although yes it will feel like it!  People can live a long happy life, so don't be thinking you will be leaving your children anytime soon, because it's HIGHLY unlikely! There are many many treatment options. I found out a few weeks ago that my lovely neighbour who had breast Cancer a year before me, has been living with secondaries to her liver for the last year! You wouldn't know, just like me she just gets on with life! Yes you have bad days, but doesn't everyone. But with the support of family, friends and the lovely people on here and on the secondaries board you will never be alone! Happy to be here every step of the way, whatever the results we shall be here for you! Now I think I have probably bored you to sleep! So shall end it there. Other than to add an extra.......... Supportive Hug! Because you can never have too many hugs! Oh and just to finish, if you have any issues sleeping over the next few days/weeks of uncertainty, please pop on to the AWAKE thread! It might not help you sleep but it'll give you a giggle! Take Care Hun, Sal xxxxx",

Because no one can change what's happening, all we can do is reassure you that you will be okay. You will find a way to get through this and we will be with you whenever you need us! As for positive stories. When you are ready pop over to the secondaries board and you will find some amazing people who have been living with this illness for years. I'm not going to lie to you Lou, because that's not fair, you need honesty! Having Secondary cancer is a minefield of emotions. You can go from super positive to super depressed in a few hours, in my experience! You can have days/weeks when you actually don't think about Cancer and other weeks when it's all you think about! Life will go on and you have to accept that life now involves hospital appointments/treatment forever! Not an easy concept to grasp! BUT you also need to remember that this is by no means the end of the world. There is so much they can do these days. Okay no one is going to promise you will reach 90! But then maybe just maybe you weren't destined to reach 90 anyway! Don't be drawn in to asking HOW LONG, because the truth is they don't know! We are all different we all react differently to treatment and we all have different lifestyles!  My Cancer has now been stable for over a year! I am only on an injection every 3 weeks and lots of pain meds! I suffer with fatigue which is tough! But I am still working 3 days a week. I am slowly learning to listen to my body, which in turn means my body gets time to rest when it needs too. Learning to conserve energy for when you want a nice day out, is important. But these are all things we can talk about, if and when you want/need to. For now take slow deep breaths and remember that whatever news you receive over the next few weeks, we'll be here to offer, support, guidance and some great big hugs!! Thinking of you Hun, your new online Buddy, Sal xxxxx",

I can't believe they didn't just give you a mammogram while you were there.  Is there any chance of you going privately for a mammogram? I know you shouldn't have to but if you can afford it at least it will be quick and hopefully put your mind at ease! Could the Surgeon not feel the lump you mentioned? If so what did he say it was? It's not something they can just ignore. The other option is to contact the hospital PALS department and explain you aren't happy and you would like a second opinion. It might get you seen quicker. Not sure how long it is for a mammogram in your area. I have found PALS to be very useful at getting things moving when the hospital aren't doing things properly. I hope you get things sorted soon.

I was on tamoxifen and had 3 monthly visits to my Oncologist for the first year following active treatment. The appointments were to check me over and discuss any issues with the Tamoxifen. My appointments then moved to 6monthly. But I didn't last long on that, as my bone mets were discovered. But if things had remained okay, I believe my hospital would of done 6 monthly checks. Of course if at any point I had worries or concerns and needed to see the surgeon or Oncologist my BCN would organise it. Hope that helps xx",

Most places these days are a one stop clinic, where you will see a breast surgeon who will examine you and ask questions about when and how you found the lump. They will send you for a mammogram, ultrasound or both! Now if they feel it is necessary they will ask if it's okay to do the biopsy while you are already lying down for the ultrasound. The biopsy can be uncomfortable, but shouldn't hurt too much as they will use an anaesthetic to numb the area. Then you will go back in to see the surgeon who will answer any questions that you might of thought of. At this point SOMETIMES depending on scans and depending on the surgeon, they might be able to say we are certain it's not cancer or we are 99% sure the results will show it is cancer....either way it will probably be approximately a week before you know for sure!  Yes it will seem like the longest week of your life, but remember whatever happens and whatever the results, we are all here for you and IF it turns out to be Breast Cancer it is very treatable, so don't panic. To finish may I offer you a calming....... Welcoe Hug! I am hoping your journey here is short. But if not you will find us a really nice bunch of people! Good Luck Hun.  Sal xxxxx",

It's frustrating when our bodies don't seem to do what we expect them to do But I think fatigue is definitely to be expected after all you have been through, and continue to go through with the tamoxifen. Are you having any sleep issues? As obviously this could cause the tiredness through the day? I know when I was on tamoxifen I was waking through the night! The other thing you could do if you are really concerned, is to see your GP and have a blood test? Just to check all is okay there? Sometimes low iron levels can cause fatigue? Maybe worth checking it out.  Hopefully you will find the solution to your fatigue, but it is still early days and your body has been through a lot. So allow yourself time to get back to 'normal'!  Hope that helps a little. Sending you a (((((((supportive hug)))))) xxx",

Thanks Julia, totally get what you are saying, but I wasn't wanting any touchy feely stuff, I have only contacted her when I have needed advice/information. Numerous times she has replied and said she'd be in touch but hasn't, which has meant me contacting her again! I have contact with a hospice nurse, but she can only deal with the pain issues. If I have issues with appointments or scans, I need to contact my BCN, but today she made me feel like I shouldn't contact her unless it's a life and death situation! The way I feel right now I wouldn't contact her even if I had an issue. I also wouldn't want her in appointments with me, so she'll have more time for other patients now, as I won't be using her services anymore! She's made me feel like a have been a nuisance and an annoyance to her.......but I'd just like to remind her that I didn't choose to get cancer, and I'd rather not be in a position where I need her help, but sadly I have no choice!

Get a few fun things in your diary ready for when you are having treatment, it's very likely you will have at least 1 good week during the 3 weeks but for some of us there were 2 good weeks! So don't think you are going to be 'very sick' because not everyone is......sadly some people do struggle, but let's hope you aren't one of them!

Thanks for the gentle hug too Amanda xxx  Hi Amanda, I honestly felt the same after each treatment, for me FEC was easy. I felt a bit 'heady' hard to explain, I was a bit more tired than usual and I lost my taste buds and of course hair  But as I said I worked throughout and I felt fine! TAX was a whole different story, but think you are only on FEC! There is a cumulative effect, in the fact you feel more tired towards the end, but having said that, by the time you are on the last one the relief that you made it through takes over. Just take things a day at a time, see how you go and ALWAYS tell the oncology team exactly how you feel, because you don't get a medal for 'being brave'! Night Hun xxx",

Well to start with you will know it when you have one! For me it starts with feeling cold, really cold, then I feel like a kettle boiling, it starts at my chest and works up to my face, I feel like I am in a sauna and at its peak I feel there must be steam coming out of my ears, or that my head is going to explode from the heat! Then the sweating starts  it's very unpleasant and embarrassing, especially when everyone around you is wrapped up for winter and you are wearing a t shirt and still sweating buckets!  Like I said if you have one you'll know it!",

You are going through a lot and sometimes having a good rant really helps! On a more productive note you mention being on Tamoxifen for a few months and it sounds like you are struggling with side affects. Firstly have you tried taking a different brand! Because a lot of us ladies have found that the side effects vary from brand to brand, which makes this journey tougher than it needs to be! So it might be worth trying a different brand.  Although just to give you a glimmer of hope' the side effects from Tamoxifen can settle after a few months so fingers crossed you might be one of the lucky ones!  Tamoxifen can also affect your mood, so that's something  to bare in mind. But I think right now you need to accept all the (((((((((((hugs)))))))))) you are offered, treat yourself to some nice things and most importantly remind yourself of how far you have come and try not to be quite so hard on yourself, which is easier said than done!

      "Content": "Hi Sally37, welcome to the group and Well Done on getting through the last 12months, we all know what a rough ride that can be!  The simple answer to your question is of course YES you can say no to AI drug, it's your body and you can put into it whatever you wish! However before you make the decision I would certainly make sure that you have spoken to your Oncologist and collected as much information as you can! It really should be an informed decision! Have you considered that the brain function could also be related to Chemo? The term Chemo brain gets used a lot, but it is real and I know many of the men and ladies on here have experienced it both during and after any Chemo treatment!  Menopause can also affect brain function, although I don't know whether you had already gone through the menopause before treatment! I think the most important thing to as yourself is, IF you stop the drug and the the Cancer returns in the next few months/years, would you regret it? Would you blame yourself? Or would you be at peace with your decision?  If you feel that you would feel okay and be able to live with that, then I think you have your answer! I am a great believer that quality of life can be just as important as quantity. But you have only been on the drug for 5months and so maybe before you stop entirely you could: try different brands? Look at what other drugs are available? Change the time of day you take the drug? All small changes that might or might not help, but that are maybe worth a try IF you haven't already tried! I am the last person to tell you not to stop as I was driven almost insane while taking Tamoxifen. So I totally understand how hard it is. But having been diagnosed with secondaries just 'before' I stopped taking it! I have always questioned whether I would of been angry at myself or blamed myself, if I had stopped the drug and then they had found the secondaries! You need to do what's best for you, which only you know! But really think about it and think about how you would feel should the worse happen! Which hopefully it won't! Good Luck with whatever you decide! (((((((((HUGS))))))) Sal xxx",

I even said I don't expect her to tell me the results but would at least relax a little, knowing I'm not going to my appointment tomorrow for nothing! She replied almost straight away, and said....... I'm sorry but I was busy in clinic yesterday so haven't had chance to look?! But they will be discussed today at the MDT and I will ask the doc if it is okay for the information to be passed on to you before your appointment tomorrow. I will email you later to let you know! So my immediate thought was, why didn't she just look on the computer and say yes it was in or no it wasn't! But maybe she didn't want me to bombard her with questions, so fair enough! I left for work thinking I would at least come home to a message saying its stable, if nothing else! If there was something else to discuss then I would at least be prepared, but obviously I was hoping for the email/call to say all is stable! Came home and checked messages, absolutely nothing  no good news, no bad news, no comments on I'm not allowed to say anything, absolutely nothing I shouldn't be surprised really, as I know how unreliable she is, but on this occasion she knew how anxious I was, so why didn't she say something......anything!! I'm now left feeling like tomorrow isn't going to bring the most positive news, because surely if it was stable she would of called me, wouldn't she? Or maybe I am over thinking it and she genuinely forgot, bloody annoying but not the end of the world!  Well at 11.40 tomorrow I will find out!

I'm not going to lie it was uncomfortable, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting! So try to reign in those thoughts. Keep reminding yourself why you are having this done and more importantly that it'll be all done before you know it! Oh and if you need to cry DO! They will totally understand!

I know there is every chance that this scan will show things have remained stable, I just wish my BCN had called to say this, rather than letting me stew until Wednesday! But you never know she might call tomorrow! As for the drugs! Well I know at some point I am going to have to take one of them! I like to think this time I will be lucky enough to be side effects free. I certainly won't be looking for of talking myself into side effects! I'm more of, pretend everything is fine and definitely don't read the side effects list! As I am already on the Zoladex I have minimal side effects to deal with already. I suppose the reality is I don't want to add anymore drugs into the mix......but at the same time, IF I need them.....because things aren't stable, I will obviously have a reason to take them. Maybe then I won't feel so scared of them?! I hope! Anyway nothing I can do to change the results. What will be will be. But thanks for the 'tough love' as you put it, I would call it an honest reply with a gentle kick hidden inside Thanks for the info on patented brands! I'm sure it'll be one of those trial and errors again, to find the best brand for me.......if I need the drugs!  Right, must be time to get a bit more sleep! Hope you have a lovely day! Hopefully I will report back on Wednesday afternoon with some GOOD news! Xxxx",

Woke after half an hour of sleep with hot flush and acid reflux. Then this morning was still aching all over with very sore breasts and pain when I breath in Now I have painful joints as well. Every joint! Typing this is painful  Hoping it's just a virus that will disappear by tomorrow. But right now feeling very sorry for myself, lying on the sofa.  How can I go from having such a great day (after my mammogram) to this?

      "Content": "HI ALL, after numerous sleepless nights drowning in sweat and some horrendous days reaching boiling point, I thought it might be time to bring this post back for anyone who missed it or for those who weren't in this position last time round but can now truly understand!  WELCOME TO THE HOT AND SWEATY CLUB:  IF YOU HAVE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE THIS, THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! SHARE YOUR TRUE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ON DEALING WITH THOSE NOT SO JOYOUS HOT FLUSHES!  ********************************************************************** HI just need to say that the longer I am on this journey the more I am wondering how it ever became \"PINK and FLUFFY? Almost 3.5years on this journey and I still haven't found the pink fluffy bit?! So I am beginning my own version, which will be.... RED and SWEATY! (Was going to be RED HOT and SWEATY, but that sounded like a title of a porn film) whoops!!!!! Now I admit it doesn't have quite the same sound about it and doesn't sound quite as glamorous! But it is more realistic of my experience over the last 3 years! Going from freezing cold to boiling hot in 5 seconds is NOT fun! Although those people not going through it don't understand how frustrating, embarrassing and exhausting it is! I'm thinking we could start our own olympics!  EVENT 1: The cardigan on and off race!!  EVENT 2: Wipe away sweat with no one noticing EVENT 3: Find something to waft (GP surgeries provide pamphlets) EVENT 4: Downing a glass of cold water as quick as possible EVENT 5: Duvet on Duvet off!! One of my best events! EVENT 6: How quickly you can get out of a crowded shop! (Ronstar) EVENT 7: Endurance, dressing with a frozen shoulder (Callie69) EVENT 8: Sheets off, Sheets on in under 2 mins (middle of night bed change) EVENT 9: Thermostat up, thermostat down (Rach1969) EVENT 10: Window open, Window shut (Rach1969) EVENT 11: Fan on, Fan off! EVENT 12: Stringing a whole sentence together (Bunty-ann) EVENT 13: Spelling and recalling simple words (Bunty-ann) EVENT 14: Icecream eating challenge....to cool down! (Croxley) EVENT 15: Washing hair out of an open window (Sammy) EVENT 16: Controlling Anxiety (Sammy) EVENT 17: Wig On, Wig Off (bougiecat) EVENT 18: Head scarf on, Head scarf off (bougiecat) EVENT 19: Nodding off, Brain says No! Nodding Off, brain says No Chance! Baton race! (mccaca) EVENT 20: The Hoovering Striptease!! (helsbels18) Please feel free to add any other EVENTS!  Now obviously I have written this as a bit of fun, I feel I can do that as I am dealing with this everyday and I know how unbelievably hard it is! So come on ladies, don't sit back and struggle with this alone! Come on and share your Sweaty thoughts and feelings! It won't solve them, but it sometimes helps to know that others are struggling to cope too!  I recall when I first suffered with hot flushes my mum used to joke about me taking my cardigan on and off, I took it for so long and then snapped! She was quite shocked at how frustrating hot flushes are, and obviously she has been through the menopause! People don't understand that drug induced hot flushes are far worse than normal menopausal flushes! (Although I'm sure some ladies struggle with normal menopause to)! They are very frequent and never ending, or that's how they feel! Between us we must be able to share some 'funny' or 'embarrassing' stories to show each other that we are not alone and that how ever horrible this is, we must fight hard to keep smiling and laughing! So let me think of my funniest tale.....hmmmmmm there are so many! But one that sticks in my head is when I was having a particularly hot moment, and the little boy I looked after had walked into the kitchen, he did an about turn and walked back in to the living room and said to his sister.....\"quick come quick she's melting\"  He had been looking at candles at school all week talking about how they melt when lit  Bless his heart I couldn't stop laughing! Kids just say it how it is! Now I'm hoping someone else has a story to tell, or I am going to feel very silly......but if nothing else I hope this post will make someone smile and feel less alone through this sh*tty time! Xxxxx",

At one point I was offered surgery to remove ovaries, but having just had surgery on my sternum and feeling rough, I decided I couldn't cope with anymore surgery at that time. I then found that the Zoladex didn't cause too many side effects, compared to my struggles with Tamoxifen it was a breeze! So then I didn't want to rock the boat, I am scared that removing ovaries might cause more severe menopausal symptoms.....of course it may not! It's very much a personal choice, you need to do what feels right for you. The injections are no problem, if you get a good nurse you don't even feel it! But obviously surgery means it's dealt with, and apparantly it is a simple surgery! Good Luck with whatever you decide. Xxx",

I had surgery before any other treatment. It was the first surgery I had ever had and like you I was nervous, the fear of the Unknown, but it really was very easy.  The pain post op was minimal and the worst thing for me was the drain following the node clearance. But even that was bearable.  The staff at the hospital are there to help you and totally understand how scary it is. But you can do this Hun, just remember after this surgery you are Cancer free  That's got to be worth all the worry.....hasn't it!! So try to put it to the back of your mind. Keep busy, enjoying Easter! Have a yummy egg or two  Surgery day will be here and gone, before you know it.  Wishing you a ((((((((((((calming hug)))))))))))) deep breaths and relax  xxxxxxxxx",

      "Content": "Had to share this one with you all, as if nothing else it made me smile. Something I have struggled to do lately! So I have an Oncology appointment booked for November. The plan is usually that I have the PET CT either the day before or morning of my afternoon appointment. So appointment came through for the Thursday of the week of my Oncol appt. Oncologist only works a Tuesday afternoon. So I contact BCN and ask if she could change it, or if easier I would. She said it was no problem and better for her to do it, as if necessary she could change my oncology appointment. So she emailed me back and said all sorted, my scan would be at 4pm on the Tuesday!! My Oncology appointment was at 1.30pm?!  So I was seeing Oncologist for scan results, before I actually had the scan.......now that's impressive  Then she had a day off so said another nurse would sort it, that BCN told the scan unit that I needed an appointment on the 14th Oct....so today!  I spoke to the scan lady today and she very happily changed the appointment to the Monday before my Oncology appt. No problem at all. She went on to say next time, call her directly......as it'll be a lot less stressful So assuming my BCN hasn't invented time travel....the moral of the story must be........IF YOU WANT A JOB DONE PROPERLY, DO IT YOURSELF   This is not a criticism of BCN's as I know some of them are very good and very supportive. I have just had issues with mine and this just made me laugh! Which made a change from crying! Xxx",

      "Content": "Honest answer Sacha is that YES for some people it is. BUT for many people like Carolyn, it's not so bad......although still not fun I worked as a nanny throughout my Chemo, I was doing nursery runs and school runs on foot, in the morning, at lunchtime and in the afternoon. On my feeling rubbish days, which I can probably count on one hand I asked favours from nanny friends or parents of other children to see if they could collect rather than me going out again! Or I caught the bus there and back to save a little bit of walking!  I'm not going to lie, it was tough and for those few months my social life in fact any life other than hospital appointments or work, were non excistant. But I wanted to continue working as it made me feel I was still in control, and it gave me something to focus on and get up for each day. Before I began I was worried about the sickness, which I never got! The sore mouth, never got and the hair loss, which I did have as I chose not to use the cold cap!  You have to REMEMEBR that people don't come on here and start a post saying CHEMO IS SOOOOOOOOO EASY! Because we all know what a reaction that would get from others who don't find it so easy. People who suffer come on for advice and support which is why it seems that chemo is so horrific. But just be reassured that for every horror story there are probably 100 positive ones. Sadly none of us know before we start how we will be affected. But the first step in my opinion is to go into it with an open mind. DON'T look for side effects, be prepared with everything you need but don't talk yourself into things! Who knows you may be one of the 'luckier' ones. But if you aren't there are plenty of things that can help you, so be honest with your team and tell them if you have any issues. Most things can be helped. But the main thing to REMEMEBR is it's not forever!!!!! Wishing you all the best for your chemo and offering you a ((((((supportive hug))))) xx",

They may decide to do Chemo first to reduce the lumps. As for aches and pains, that's totally normal. Your mind is going into overdrive and there isn't much you can do about it. Try and keep busy so you don't have so much time to think about it, and yes I know that is easier said than done. Wednesday probably seems a million miles away right now, but nothing is going to change over the next week, so try to reign in those thoughts. Whatever they find, cancer or not will be treatable, and once you know what is happening and you have a treatment plan in place you will begin to feel more in control, which hopefully will help you to relax.

Very reassuring.  Do you have a view on chemo or surgery first?  Breast preservation isn't an issue - I'm at the stage where I want everything gone.  xx My view has been to just do what is recommended. I had surgery first as my lump was 2.5cm and they had originally said I would have a lumpectomy and then radiotherapy. But as it was found in my lymph nodes, I then had surgery to remove those and then Chemo.  I am sure every hospital has its own system, so wait till you have your results and then discuss things with the 'experts'.  Hope you have a lovely birthday tomorrow, definitely a nice distraction  xxx",

Then in to the CT scanner, where they scanned and then 2 nurses/radiographers asked if I was happy for them to do the tiny tattoos.....don't think I had much choice?!  They were a tiny pin prick nothing painful at all. Then on my way out they needed a photograph to put on my records! Not sure why?! Then I went home. I was then called back a week later to discuss things as my heart and lung were in the treatment area, so I was re scanned using a breath hold technique! Sorry I can't help on the implant side of things, but hope that helps a little. Xxx",

      "Content": "Hi CARDBOND, like Carolyn I was given the follow up results appointment at my origional visit! Seems odd to be waiting for a result like that in the post! I'd like to think that's because they are pretty sure it isn't cancer, but obviously if that was the case they would of told you that on the day? Where are you based? Maybe your hospital has a different system! As Carolyn suggested, try and keep busy, although I think I would give the hospital a call and just ask them to clarify what will happen, if it's bad news or if it's clear? Seems a strange way to potentially tell someone they have breast cancer! Which hopefully you don't. Hope news comes soon! (((((((Hug)))))) xx",

BUT in the last few weeks the night sweats have been horrendous, I am waking every 1.5 - 2 hours, dripping with sweat :-( it's just awful.  Anyone else found their night sweats have got worse?

I lasted 20months but that was only because my oncologist kept pushing me to keep going, his view was the first 2 years were the most important. I won't go into what happened with me as it doesn't help you. I will however say there are other options! Zoladex injections to shut down your ovaries, or surgery to remove your ovaries? Then you would be put onto one of the post menopause drugs, like Letrozole. Worth discussing?? However, I think you have to bare in mind that all of these treatments will cause menopausal symptoms and of course it's worse for us as we are being forced into menopause! Out of interest have you tried changing your brand of tamoxifen? Sounds silly but different brands can have different side effects! Worth discussing everything with your oncologist, the more information you can get the better. You need to be able to make an informed decision. At the end of the day it's your body, your life and your decision! I know how it feels to feel so old and unhappy! Sending you a (((((((((((((((BIG HUG)))))))))))))) xxxxxxx",

I am no expert but I would say, with all your symptoms it's highly unlikely you will come away today without a biopsy! So try to relax!

There is most certainly no written rules on how long it takes to get over Breast Cancer! For some they have treatment and bounce right back! Others take months others years! I was one of the ones who took years to finally admit that what I had been through was horrid and that I was ANGRY, angry at the Cancer for messing up my life! Nothing was easy anymore, it had taken so much from me and I had to try and learn to accept what I had been left with! Well with the support of people on here and the lovely ladies on Maggies and in the Maggies and Force centres. I now feel in control of my life! I thought I could do all this alone! I have never needed others to help sort my feelings, but on this occassion I couldn't go it alone! We all need to ask for help at some point. You my lovely have made the first step in getting back on track! You are opening up to us, about how you really feel! Well done Hun! So what now? Well maybe chatting to the helpline might help, or if you feel you are depressed seeing your GP to discuss things? Seeing a counsellor might help? Or just sounding off on here for a bit might help! The main thing is to realise that this is 'normal' you have been through a huge thing and you aren't through it yet. So please be kind to yourself. Yes you need to find a way to help you through this, but it's nothing to be worried about. I promise you most of us have been where you are! I hope it helps to know you aren't alone. Please keep talking! Don't be afraid to say whatever you need to. We are all here for you Hun, day or night someone will be around. Take Care Hun. Sal xxx",

I had a PICC 3 years ago and remember clearly going in and hearing how easy it was to put in and it wouldn't take them long etc etc Had a nice male nurse, he tried and tried and tried, each time he introduced the needle the vein collapsed. Goodness knows how many attempts later, he admitted defeat. My whole arm was black and blue! The next day I was due to have chemo in the afternoon, so he said to go there first and he would try again. This time I drank lots of water and he placed warmed towels over my arm before he started, he also with my permission put the needle/line in without a local anaesthetic, he had found that my veins were constricting as the anaesthetic was going in, which apparantly can happen sometimes. Anyway about 15mins after arriving there, my PICC line was in, and I was off to X-ray to check its position! Had no problems after that. Will always remember the look on his face when he saw the bruise on my arm the following day, especially as he had told me what a simple procedure it was  These things happen. Hopefully tomorrow will work out better for you. Drink lots and try to relax xxxxx",

Made worse by the fact that no one else can see it or understand it. Outwardly we look fine, but inside we are struggling to get through the day! What I would ask/suggest is have you had a blood test recently? If not it's worth checking that your iron levels are okay and your thyroid. Both of which can cause fatigue.  Sadly I have no answers on how to solve the issue, other than to rest when you need to but also make sure you get some exercise during the day as its been proven to be good for fatigue......sounds silly I know! I also know how hard it is to force yourself to go for a walk when all you want to do is sleep or sit down, but it's worth trying. Sorry I can't help more, but at least you know you aren't alone. I can offer you a supportive...... HUG xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
