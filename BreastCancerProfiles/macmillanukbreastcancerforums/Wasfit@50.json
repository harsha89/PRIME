      "Content": "Hi NikkiT1204NikkiT1204 Way back at the end of April my consultant wasn't concerned re my.lymph nodes being affected and removed my tumor (primary invasive breast cancer) however through the WLE found one of my 23 nodes were affected, yes this was a shock to me. I'm not sure how much Cancer was in the nodes. The Optima trial (please Google this)was offered and at the same time full lymph node removal and chemotherapy was offered. Took a long time to decide but as chemotherapy was offered I chose to take it knowing I never like to put even a paracetamol inside my body. I am now waiting for my last Chemotherapy.in 2 weeks thrn Radiotherapy and hormone treatment and not suffrered any real side effects to the chemotherapy.. Affected boob  gets on my.nerves at tme(abit achy ) but no had any seromas or lymphedema. Hope this helps",

      "Content": "Hi, I too had the biopsy (10.05.18) and lumpectomy and waited for results whilst undertaking the exercises given and carrying on with life as normal....or trying to, I had clear margins around the lump however, there were Cancer cells in the first node so had to go back in for a full node clearance (14.06.18) which again was a waiting game for these further results. 22 Lymph nodes were taken (we all have different numbers) and all these were tested clear.  Chemotherapy was offered, I am now on day 13 of my first session of Chemotherapy and juist in case you go down the same route I have had no side effects from the Chemotherapy. Hope you get the results you want, take care Julie",

      "Content": "Hi similar to yourself, lumpectomy and prepared myself for Radiotherapy as the ultrasound had caused no concern however Senital node biopsy showed cancer cells in the first node therefore had to have the full clearance, its the waiting game that's the worst, the second op was fine, drain for 5 days but didn't stop me from going out, just placed it in my handbag and hoped no one tried to pinch it, the hospital also gave me a pretty bay to carry my drain around. All of the other 22 nodes were clear, was offered the Optima trial but as was offered Chemotherapy if not wanting to enter into the trial. I took that. Now on day 2 of my second session and no side effects up to now apart from the hair loss this week. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi all Had my last Docetaxol on 11th Nov and initial consent signing form soon after. Got my \" marking up\"appointment tomorrow then hopefully start in 2 weeks. I am feeling quite apprehensive about this as didn't have any real side effects from my Chemotherapy.  For any new people my Onchologist says she always starts treatment 4 weeks after the last Chemotherapy if had Docetaxol) earwig o feel we're in a race to the finishing line as gone through this together.....wow this seems ages away since our first posts on the Chemotherapy group. Hope all goes well for you. When mentioning the R1 R2 cream was this provided by your hospital or where do I buy it from if needed ? Take care all",
