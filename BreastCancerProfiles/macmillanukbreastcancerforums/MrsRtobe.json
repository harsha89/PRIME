      "Content": "Hi all, I was diagnosed on the 12th September with A 44mm breast tumour that is er+. At age 24 It came as quite a shock, I've had bone scans MRI cat scan mammogram and there was no spread. I've also had a sentinel node biopsy and that also showed no spread. During the healing time from my surgery until my chemo myself and my fianc√© were able to undergo ivf and now have 4 embryos stored for the future if needed. I had my first fec session yesterday and felt truly awful last night but have woke up today with only side effects I can notice being aching legs and a horrible taste in my mouth. I'm concerned this means that I'm not getting the right dose or that its not working!!! I've also had awfully sore breasts (even the unaffected one) which is worrying me that in the time since my scans and mammograms my cancer may have spread to the left breast!!! I'm driving my self crazy worrying, which is why I have decided to write my first post. Any replies will be much appreciated. Sarajane xxx",

      "Content": "HI everyone, Thank you so much for all your replies I feel a lot more positive now. I am so glad I decided to post on here instead of worrying about it all in my own. Family and partner have been great and so supportive but I hate to stress them with my worries. I tried the ice cap on Tuesday but I'm not sure i can handle it again, I found it very painful and feel like ad ots bot 100% should i jjust cut my loses and go with the wig if it all comes out, has any persevered with the cap and found it worked well?

      "Content": "Hi Lola, I'm in the same situation as you but having 4 fec (my first yesterday) 4 tax. I hate knowing that I have to wait for another 7 sessions before they will actually remove the thing from me! How did you find FEC? Like I said my first was yesterday at half 9 and I felt pretty wretched from 6pm last night but today seems to have been pretty ok, not sure how long this will last but have been advised by another poster today to make the most of feeling ok.
