      "Content": "Hi Ro5ieposie thanks for the tip on Sage Leaf. I am Letrozole and have been 18 months. Some days worse than others with the joint pain. Mornings are bad as I hirple around for a good while till am pain free. Means getting up two hours before I need to in order to be ready to get to work. The night sweats are worse than flushings to be honest. This makes sleeping difficult and means I am tired during the day at work. I have been known to drop off at my desk!!!! I think am just blinking and wake thinking oh no done it again. People look at you and see you looking 'normal' but they have no idea how things have changed how I am changed and what I have to deal with on a daily basis just getting to work is a trial!",

      "Content": "OK further to the differing brands of Letrozole. The ones I have had this month are TEVA white box with a pale blue circle on the top right corner. These ones have had me flushing like a mad woman in a disco for three weeks!!! Joint pain not so much but the flushings have been horrendous night and day with very little let up. I am due a new script this week and will ask for another brand and see what they do and report back.",

      "Content": "I am a Reiki Master and also a one year survivor. I have given Reiki to many cancer patients and also myself. It aids in helping someone cope with treatments and after effects. There is no 'payment' as such for Reiki unless one is practicing with clients. You do not have to express gratitude other than 'thank you that was lovely' or whatever it is you wanted to say. The Reiki is an intelligent energy and goes where it needs to be. I would say if you found it a relaxing thing to receive then go ahead and ask your friend for treatments. Most of all enjoy the process and use it to help you achieve a sense of calm. I used it after my first surgery and it helped keep the feelings of fear and worry at bay. It calmed me enough not to run screaming in a theatre gown from the ward!! :)",

      "Content": "I have been on Letrozole for just over a year. I have not had any hair thinning in fact my hair seems to have become thicker and stronger according to my hairdresser. The worst part for me is the tiredness, sore joints mainly my shoulders, hands and two toes on my right foot. Night sweats and flushes also. The biggest thing for me though is the insomnia which is another side effect.  My main struggle is getting up for work in the mornings when having not slept well in the night. I am under pressure at work to maintain my hours etc which am doing to the best of my ability. I worked right through my treatment last year and in all between two ops and radiotherapy I was only off in total 20 days!!! I feel in retrospect I should have had more time off as my body now is tired if that makes sense. I also work with a guy in my office who stabs me in the back at any opportunity (he is a young man 26 years old) and sees me as an old woman I am 59 now but by god I do my share of work. He is now making comments given that I can no longer lift the heavy weights around the work ( we are IT technicians)  I am sorry this has started into some kind of rant it was never meant to be. I just feel I am doing the best I can given the extra things Letrozole has placed on my life but I am grateful for those things cause it means I am here!",

      "Content": "More in this saga. I had to chuckle at the go to your manager. Am saying this in humour Mollydog :) The managers in here do NOTHING! I was asked at a meeting by said manager two weeks ago why did I not change my pills if they were giving me side effects!!!!! Also why was I not allowed to lift heavy weights anymore. It was like explaining to a child in slow easy to understand English. The upshot was they sent me to Occ Health and they were appalled by what has been said to me. They wrote the report back to employers and basically gave them a flea in the ear. I ordered the Macmillan Employer Pack for the management here and I can guarantee it has not even been opened!  I am doing ok at the moment some mornings get up like a 90 year old and hirple around till I have had a bath and joints are loose enough to get dressed and get to work. I am grateful for the Letrozole and the fact that I am here!!",
