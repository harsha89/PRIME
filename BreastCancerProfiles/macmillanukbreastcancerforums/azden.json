      "Content": "Thanks for your comments. I am 54 in July and had a mastectomy with reconstruction last September. I had the implant with stratus and all went good. I  was feeling really good but recently things emotionally seem to be going pear shape. My nurse who gives my injection says this is quite a normal reaction but that is not really helping at the moment. I'm a teacher so are on hols at moment so am going to gym and walking etc every day but still can't lift this mood!. I know i've got to continue with medication ( will be even more anxious if I come off). I should be more positive as I had results of recent mri few weeks ago and all was good__ hope I'm just having bad spell and get back to 'normal'. - if I've ever been that.  It definately helps getting other peoples thoughts on things. I speak to lots of people but not the same if they not had similar probs. Just off to walk pen yr fan so hope that will cheer me up. Liz ",

      "Content": "Hiya, I'm new to this site and am 6 months into having zoladex injections and taking tomoxifen and I feel like i'm suddenly losing the plot. I am not sleeping very well, waking at least 3/4/ times, usually soaking with sweat and worse still is I'm very anxious about everything. I feel that I'm struggling to cope in work and don't have much confidence at the moment - even though all should be good now!!  Anyone out there feel the same or do I just need to pull myself together_ am trying but not good today!!",
