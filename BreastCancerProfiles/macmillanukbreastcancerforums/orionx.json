    "Content": "Hello, Where do you live ? some people in this forum are from southern hemisphere... Well if you live in northen hemisphere, like europe for example, normaly the seasonal flu is gone and you must wait until september or october to get the vaccine, because the virus change every year, and maybe the prior vaccine won't be effective. Seasonal flu is not common and very rare on summer, because the virus can't live if the air temperature is high and also because it mutated. Ask your Gp or Onco, because 2 weeks are needed for the vaccine to be effective, and you should consider side effects. About swine flu, unfortunately you must wait until the vaccine will be available, except if you are on trial. And the first trials will be available in august I think, and the vaccine not until september or october. If you get the seasonal flu vaccine it won't protect you against swine flu.... If you live in southern hemisphere, you must of course get the seasonal vaccine and wait for the swine flu vaccine to come. If very important to know than even if you have on chemo and your immune system is low, you can get through the flu, if you get it of course...If you compare deads from this illness versus dead from cancer, it is obvious. This new virus is not agressive for the vast majority of us. But like every illness, some people even if they are well, can get serious problems, and no one can tell you why. But first don't pannic. People who are experiencing bad situation about flu and become critical ill are usually people with serious illness who usually affects the lung, like TB, Severe Pneumonia and some genetic illness, like cystic fibrosis. The the best option for you is to talk the issue with you doctor. He/She is the only one who can tell you what to do. Take Care David",
