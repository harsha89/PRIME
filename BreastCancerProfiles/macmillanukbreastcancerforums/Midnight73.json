    "Content": "Hi, I agree with tessa 2. I have very sensitive teeth and my Dentist was concerned that the chemo will cause discomfort to my gums and mouth and she was so right. From day one I used Difflam and I purchase the mouth wash from the dentist that they give you when you rinse your teeth at the practise.  I did need a root canal after my chemo, but a least I could control the discomfort while I was going through the treatment. My dentist also advised me that an electric tooth brush is always the best option as it clean more effectively than a manual (which I was advised to do)   Difflam as to be prescribed, but it really doe work when you get use to the taste",
