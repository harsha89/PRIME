    "Content": " Hi Harley 53,  I am so sorry to hear what you\u2019re going through and have been through very similar since diagnosis January 17. I\u2019ve also had a history of UTIs and had just started using Vagifem pre-diagnosis, very successfully to help with post-menopause symptoms. I have had a persistent UTI since my Mastectomy and reconstruction last year and have been on constant antibiotics since .  I am just about to stop Letrazole in favour of Tamoxifen to allow me to resume using Vagifem which fingers crossed will help.  Will report back in due course .   The UTIs are such a quality of life issue ,   Best wishes and hope you find some Solutions,. These forums are an absolute godsend.",
