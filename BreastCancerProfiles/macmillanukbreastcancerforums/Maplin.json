    "Content": "Hi Sasha. I finished chemo yesterday and used cold cap throughout. I had moderate hair loss with EC about 30% but I\u2019ve got thick hair and it wasn\u2019t very noticeable (to others). But I\u2019ve lost loads with Docetaxel. You can see my scalp. I have reads loads of comments about hair regrowing whilst on tax but the chemo nurses didn\u2019t seem to think this was a common occurrence, maybe in my case as I\u2019ve also had Perjita and Herceptin. I\u2019m using hair fibres to cover the bald patches and I must say I\u2019m impressed. There is no resemblance of the sleek bob I had before in fact it looks like a bad thin nylon wig! But hey, the chemo\u2019s done and hopefully the cancer is done also and hair is something to look forward to!! Good luck with your next cycle and I hope your hair loss slows down xxxxx",
