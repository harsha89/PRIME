    "Content": "Ladies, although I'm a man, I'm familiar with breast cancer as my mother had a mastectomy. I remember how she always struggled with her bra, stuffing the empty cup with either tissues or socks and never getting it quite right. Somewher in this thread I read a lady's lament of how she could no longer wear her bra but her F sized breast needed support. As I've had a doublesided orchiectomy as treatment for my prostate cancer, I'm now developing breasts myself and wear a bra because my nipples are hyper sensitive. Doing some web searching I on bras I came upon the following website that I think might (could?) be of interest to those of you who've had a mastectomy. http://www.monokini2.com/ More URLs: https://mbasic.facebook.com/Monokini2  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BukCGTV8NhE  I don't know if she speaks English, dont have soundcard here. Perhaps these people, through MacMillan, can design standard monobras as well? Hope this info'll help you further. Cordially, Edwina",
