      "Content": "Hi Have just read your post and you are the mirror image of me. I'm crying reading it as everything you have written is so true and so 'me. I've just found out I have secondary bone cancer in my humerus and ribs 2 years nearly exactly to the day from breast cancer diagnosis. Back on that roller coaster. I punish myself everyday for feeling tired and lifeless and just can't find any inner energy. Before my diagnosis my life was 100mph. Teaching full time, 2 daughters and a grandchild to have fun with. Now I'm summoning the energy to get thru each day.work cut to 3 days and nana naps on my days off. Have the prospect of more treatment now and worrying about our daughters big wedding in August. More downs than ups at the moment xxx",

      "Content": "Hello. Hoping someone can advise. Had deep lateral lumpectomy June 2015. Had radiotherapy and on tamoxifen. Due to duct ectasisa after radiotherapy had a Hadfields procedure in July 2017. Have been told i have a tumor growing in my arm and on my 7th rib but still awaiting further appointments and decisions. Friday before christmas i found a painful lump under my left armpit and had awful breast pain. Got to GP day after boxing day. Thinks it' something on scar band? Breast and under arm very painful (like 100 hot needles) . I'm awaiting consultant appt on January 30th (). Very worried and waiting is a nightmare. Anybody had similar?Â ",
