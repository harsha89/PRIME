      "Content": "Just goes to show how different hospitals do it different ways. I had my first lot of FEC today and in the bag of medicines they sent me home with me they gave me a packet of Dioctyl (docusate sodium) for constipation. I did use the cold cap today, felt like I had a great big igloo on my head but it was tolerable. Not sure if I will carry on using it or not, depends a bit on what happens to my hair over the next few weeks and how I feel about my wig when I get it. Apologies if threre is any spelling or grammar mistake, feel like I am suffering from a very bad hangover at the moment.",

      "Content": "I had my first FEC last week (7/5) but I am a bit concerned at the moment because I have 3 school age children (4,9 and 12) and at the moment it seems like everyone in their school is dropping like flies from a sickness bug that is doing the rounds. Does anyone know how \"bad\" sickness bugs are for us during the chemo? Mimi",

      "Content": "I am all set for my first FEC in the morning, getting a bit nervous now but at the same time I am glad to get started. Been feeling a bit down today because saw the oncologist earlier today and the CT scan was showing several suspicious lesions on my lungs. Could be nothing but it could be the cancer spreading. They are too small to biopsy so instead I am just going to have to wait and see how they react to the chemo.",
