      "Content": "Hello Helen.  I think the problem is who is responsible for what. I go to the cancer care nurse and she tells me that i should go to my doctor about my knee pain as i've had it at least a year before i had cancer. At my doctor, I've had no proper diagnosis, just been told it's wear and tear, use analgesic rubs and ointments.  But with Letrozole and with Aromasin it seems to invade my whole body, making me feel bad all over and sometimes so painful to walk that i'm losing my confidence about how far i can go alone. I also get aching wrists, thumbs, adn carpel tunnel syndrome in both hands at night. It seems to go in cycles.  (and unfortunately after 20 years with one doctor, she has now retired and i have no continuity at my surgery. They do not seem to be very aware of cancer drugs or symptoms.) My doctor tells me to go back to the hospital and discuss it with them. I'm in the dark. So i feel stuck in the middle and getting nowhere.  Pat",

      "Content": "Hi JaneWithoutay, I was on Letrozole for a year and was crippled by it. On bad bouts i couldn't walk unaided. In January i had a break and changed to Aromasin, and i'm afraid it has the same or similar effects on me. I had knee problems anyway, (i'm 66) but some days i can barely walk. I feel obliged to see it through a bit longer and then ask to  take the risk? of some other medication. It not only affects me physically, but mentally i just don't feel like myself at all.  The irony of it is that my cancer was caught early, hadn't spread, and was a very small tumour and only 15 sessions of radiotherapy. I dealt with all that fine - until the medication - the thought of 4 more years in constant pain and becoming more imobile - i wonder some days if i would be better off just stopping all medication and at least enjoying my old age!.  I'm so glad to hear that there is one option left.  Best wishes - and so glad to hear that there is life after Letrozole adn Aromasin.  Pat",

      "Content": "In February 2016 I was diagnosed with breast cancer - a small tumour in my left breast, which hadn\u2019t spread to my lymph nodes and was removed by lumpectomy. All went well.  I was prescribed Letrozole, which was so painful for me. I\u2019m now taking Aromasin, which isn\u2019t quite so bad, but does make me tired and pained, especially my arm and my knees. All pains seem much worse than they ever did. I am 66 but i feel as if i\u2019ve aged 20 years in the last two. Depression has been hard to manage too. I\u2019m afraid i\u2019m confused. I found my meetings with the surgeon a bit of a blur. I didn\u2019t understand quite a bit.  He kept talking about \"5 years\" and \"maybe 10 years\u2026\u2026..\" and saying my prognosis was good. I asked what that meant but never felt as if i got a straight answer. I still don\u2019t know. 5 years to live? ten years? five years cancer free?  If 5 years cancer free, reliant on taking Aromasin, which has put me in so much pain, and robbed me of a lot of feeling of connection to life, and mobility, is life as i can expect it, then i\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it.  I have a friend who had a mastectomy 26 years ago, and rejected chemotherapy after two sessions. She is an academic and valued being able to think over extending a deadened life. She was frowned upon. 26 years later, she is still alive and thinking and writing.  I am an artist. I\u2019ve been unable to continue painting since being on medication. It makes me feel emotionally dead, and i can\u2019t feel joy or life any more.  There is a bigger picture of the meaning of a cancer diagnosis that has only recently started to become clear to me. I felt at first that i had been 'cured' by my surgery. Now i realise that it\u2019s a life sentence, and that it may recur at any time without medication. The medication makes my life meaningless.  I don\u2019t know what to do or think. I don\u2019t know who to ask who will give me an honest overview. All my cancer hospital contacts only deal with the next problem, not the overview of how it\u2019s affecting my life. Some days i think i could be developing other cancers and how would i know? I can take honesty, but i do feel as a patient i\u2019ve been fed only the palatable snippets of my diagnosis and am living in ignorance.  Please can anyone help me?",

It seems remarkably simple, but for the last month i've been taking a concoction of vitamins that have improved my mobility and general functioning immensely. I'm no longer living below the line of what felt like normal before. I have more energy, and am starting, after two years of catching all sorts of malaises, and the dreadful rashes, to feel human again.  I take a multivitamin, vitamin d, vitamin c and calcium each day and the change is amazing. Can it all really have been down to running on empty? I think my immune system is building up again, and i am hoping very much that the rashes won't get a hold again.  Thanks so much all, for listening adn for your advice! xxx",

In 2013 circumstances around my home (excessive noise through the night caused by criminal activity next to my house)   and my desperate dealings with he police to do something about it - went on for two to three years. I wasn't getting proper sleep for all this time and anxiety and depression drove me to a mental breakdown. I sought adn got counselling for 22 months.  then i found i had cancer. I went to my counsellor and said - hi - i've got breast cancer. We both burst out laughing. It was so ridiculous after what i'd been going through that i'd got cancer on top of it all.  18 months later, i'm finally coming out of frightening depression, but still feel chemically castrated! ha. no libido - none - dead as a doornail. I think my creative life as an artist,  painting is a memory. That makes me more depressed.   I'm going to talk to my oncologist. My doctor is a dinosaur. I'm used to fighting my corner but this has flattened me.  Thank you for your sensitive kind reply. x",

      "Content": "Hi Shellian -  I'm hoping something good happens to lift you soon! I was lucky that i only needed a lumpectomy, and radiotherapy, but the post surgery drugs (the 5 year thing) are a bit of a handful. I'm only just realising that surgery isn't the end of it! I wonder if i'm a bit slow sometimes, still in denial, or wasn't listening. sometimes it's hard to take it all in when it's happening. It sounds like your case was much harder than mine.  I had a brother but he didn't care and was no help at all. My partner tries but he has no idea how isolated i feel.  This is a good place for you to shout, ask, tell, cry, whatever! It's a very caring community.  I felt like i sailed through the diagnosis, surgery, the lot. I almost felt like i was undeserving because it was caught so soon. 18 months later i'm still a blur, and realising that however you thought you were coping, your body has it's own ways and time and you just have to put up with it for a bit! I've always been prone to depression and the drugs seem to make it worse. People seem to be almost embarrassed when you tell them. Bear with them, they can feel hopeless and helpless to help. It's not always callous or unfeeling - fear does funny things. Let them go, but don't hold it against them. You'll find new friends who can understand it. xxx I do hope things will improve for you - you'll come through it xxx Pat",
