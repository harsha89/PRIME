      "Content": "Hi  I have just read the comments on cold symptoms and bad chest and sore throat. I\u2019m due my third chemotherapy next Wednesday and have been suffering all those things for the last 3 days it\u2019s worse at night I seem to cope better with it through the day. I\u2019ve just been taking cocodamol which are hard to swallow as my throat feels like I\u2019ve swallowed broken glass that\u2019s the only way I can describe it.  I\u2019m hoping by Tuesday when I get my bloods done it\u2019s going to be a lot better I don\u2019t want my chemotherapy delayed I just want to get the treatment over with my last of 6 will be jan then radiotherapy after that. I hope I\u2019m doing the right thing just getting on with it by reading the comments it seems a common complaint during chemotherapy. Fingers crossed. ",
