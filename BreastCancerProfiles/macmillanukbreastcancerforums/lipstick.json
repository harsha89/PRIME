I must admit I feel a little better when I take it. so I'd say yes give it a go, but check out that it's ok with your doctor. Can I ask what brand you are taking?  One option might be to try a different brand if you get a lot of SE's with this one.",

Has anyone had different side effects with different brands of Tamoxifen and if so, which brands have been the best? I had a bad reaction to the first brand I took and am nervous about changing in case I get a return of the side effects. Lipstick",

      "Content": "  I understand that it shouldn't make any difference as to the brand of Tamoxifen, but it seems that this is not what happens for some women. I have found other comments on  forums from women who experience far more side effects with one brand than another. In some cases they have not been aware of the change of brand, they just get a load of se's and it's only when their next round of tablets are back to the first brand and the se's decrease that they realise their brand had been changed by the pharmacist to whatever they happen to have in stock.  It seems unlikely that this is psychological when they weren't even aware of the change of brand. In my case, I had significant symptoms within 12 hours of my first tablet, including headache, nausea, swelling of stomach, joint pains and in particular pelvic pain. After struggling for nearly 3 weeks, I was advised to stop and the pain subsided within a day. This reaction has been reported through the yellow card scheme. It was only through my bcn and oncologist that I was tried on a different brand and although there are still joint pains and hot flushes, I feel completely different on this version. It may just be me, but I have spoken to a number of doctors, nurses and pharmacists who are fully aware of this.It seems more than anecdotal. They're not sure why, they suggest it might be coatings or bindings put with the drug, not the active ingredient.  I feel it would benefit all of us if the whole issue of Tamoxifen and it's se's could be looked at so that if there is a difference then we could find out why and get se's reduced for all women.  ",
