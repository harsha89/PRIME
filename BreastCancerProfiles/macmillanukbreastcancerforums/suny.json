    "Content": "Aprilclaire, it is simply appalling to read what you have endured over the years and that you have been left so unsupported. All your symptoms of joint pain, pins and needles, breathlessness etc should be investigated and you should absolutely be validated. Have you been offered any basic blood tests? Whilst you are finding a new oncologist please ask  another GP from your practice to run a series of tests on basic biochemistry and maybe they can make some suggestions. I have found this very strange in breast cancer, blood testing seems to be  rarely requested for  investigation of renal, liver function, full blood counts, testing for multiple anaemias, endocrine disorder etc. You must pursue a second opinion, there are some great  doctors out there. The Royal Marsden and potentially Addenbrookes, Christies ?? I am not sure if I can post links about seeking second opinions but I will have a go, hope I do not get in to trouble. http://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/treating/treatment-decisions/who-will-be-involved-in-my-treatment-decision/getting-a-second-opinion.html http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/cancer-questions/seeing-a-different-doctor-for-a-second-opinion Thinking of you, best wishes Suny    ",
