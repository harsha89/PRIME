    "Content": "Hello, I\u2019m taking  letrozol  about a month now. No big side effects as of yet except for an occasional hot flash. I wanted to take vitamins and my doctor approved me to take only vitamin D3 and calcium. I ordered my vitamins but I see it also includes some vitamin C and boron. Haven\u2019t contacted my doctor yet, but is it safe to take those two other elements within the vitamin?",
