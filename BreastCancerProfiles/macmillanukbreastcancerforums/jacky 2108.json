      "Content": "I had exactly the same thing!  I think we are just more aware of our breast(s) now so any tiny sensation that we would have normally ignored, our minds go into overdrive and we instantly think 'cancer'! I think it is something we have to just get used to. My mastectomy was last year and my reconstruction 3 months ago and I am finally getting on with my life.  BUT when we realised I hadn't had a period for 2 months my hubby instantly panicked and packed me off to the doctors because he was so worried - I'm 52 and other symptoms so obviously point to the menopause but we only focus on the cancer whereas we may never have even considered it before diagnosis.  I hope that makes sense. Best of luck with your surgery xxxx",

      "Content": "Hi My mastectomy wound was basically just dressed with steri strips and an ordinary dressing over the top. The dressing was taken off after about a week from what I remember, and I was told I could shower a few days after that to soak off the steri strips - although they stayed fast and my bcn removed them in the end. After that I could shower freely.  Meantime I washed at the sink and used Andrex moist toilet tissue regularly during the day to stay fresh down below (as I react to soap in that area). I used roll on deodorant on my underarms and talc in any 'creases'. Not being able to shower was a pain as I have long hair and couldn't lift my arm enough to wash/condition it over the sink but it was a small price to pay for getting rid of the cancer. Good luck with your op xxxx",

Everyone kept telling me how brave I was being but I didn't feel brave, it felt like I was on a roller coaster with no escape route - but I kept going, only taking time off work for appointments & surgery. I should have had reconstruction 12th May & it was cancelled at the last minute - for me that was when it finally hit me that I had breast cancer & only one remaining breast.  I have been on anti depressants & signed off work with stress since the cancelled operation date, I got so run down that I ended up on antibiotics for a bug I picked up.  I am now 7 months post diagnosis, & 6 months post mastectomy - you'd have thought I would have accepted it by now but I now realise that by keeping busy back then I was just blocking it all out & only now am I coming to terms with what has happened in & to my body.   It is a very hard process to go through, & we all work through it at our own pace.  Don't be too hard on yourself - & STOP SAYING YOU ARE STUPID! I have no idea what I would have done without this site, it really has been my lifeline & I have made at least one good friend because of it!

Then my breast cancer diagnosis reared its ugly head.  My closest friend in that group has backed right off from me because apparently all I care about is how people react to me. She herself had a big cancer scare a few years ago so I thought she would understand.  I now feel that I have lost one group of friends over all this because she is the main one that the group evolves around.  It really isn't fair,  we didn't ask for this cancer and it affects or lives in so many ways! ",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah My situation was  completely different to yours but I want to share my experience.  My breast cancer was found at my first routine mammogram, I had further scans, biopsies, etc and was then told I needed a mastectomy.  After the mastectomy I was called in for my results to be told they got it all so no further treatment necessary (except reconstruction at a later date) so basically it was bye bye from that surgeon and dept. I know I should have been pleased but I wasn't.  Don't get me wrong it is not that I wanted to go through chemo but I wanted to do all I could to fight the cancer. I know this will seem silly but at the time I felt let down, it was as if they had taken my breast away for no reason then said \"it is okay after all\". I was not told my grade or stage and at the time did not know enough to ask.  I know I'm not explaining this very well but I wanted to do all I could to fight the b*stard and felt that right had been taken away from me. Now, 9 months later, I am recovering and know i was lucky BUT if the cancer was to return I will always regret not being given that option to kick its *rse once and for all!  Sending you big hugs and wishing you lots of luck whatever you decide.  You have come to the right place fur support, there are some wonderful supportive people here xxxxx",

They would not tell me anything on the day of my tests,  they gave me an appointment for 10 days later to be told any results.  Also,  it might be worth ringing the hospital/breast unit beforehand to find out the set up before you take hubby  along.  At my local hospital all ladies having the tests are given cloaks (open at front) to change into then wait together in the same waiting room.  This is a ladies only room,  luckily I took a female friend with me so she was allowed in while all male partners had to wait in the main waiting area.  Best of luck with your tests, I was told to allow 2 hours but it was actually 3 and a half.  Please stay in touch and let us know how you get on.  Jacky xx",

      "Content": "I'm a bit of a lingerer here who reads most posts but doesn't reply very often, & when I do I sometimes feel that I have said the wrong thing but that is the essence of the written word - it can be misinterpreted as the tone of voice cannot be heard.   George has always been very supportive of everyone & his post above was just that, but unfortunately everything can be taken the wrong way depending on your frame of mind at the time. So.... I am going to give my experience of cancer & how it has changed my life as two versions - please read both before you judge: VERSION ONE 1. I also lost my best friend who accused me of only thinking about how others react to me.  This was at a time when I really needed support & understanding. 2. I lost a breast - OK, I didn't need chemo or radiotherapy because they \"got it all\" - if the cancer wasn't that bad that I didn't need to fight with all my being by going through chemo then why did they need to remove half of what I see as my female form? That seems very drastic to me! (my legs are badly scarred & mishapen from an RTA when I was a teenager so my breasts were all I had to make me feel female).  As a result of the turmoil this put me through I ended up having counselling which the hospital arranged - I have always been a strong person & just needing counselling hit me hard! 3. My first scheduled date for reconstruction was cancelled & I fell even deeper into the dark hole of depression - I have been on antidepressants ever since and am unable to wean myself off them. 4. I have a large scar around my torso from the DIEP reconstruction - my hubby commented on the scar the other night then got upset because it reminded him of all I have been through & with further operations to come. 5. My 'new breast' is scarred, it has a dip in it, it is bigger than the other & has no nipple.  Some clothes I have actually enhance the difference in size so I have to think about what I wear. 6.  I have always been a really independent person who is strong willed, but not long after my surgery I had a major panic attack in the middle of a supermarket because my hubby went out of sight & it took me at least 10 minutes to find him.  I was crying, out of breath & shaking.  I felt like a young child who had lost her parent in a crowd & that fear panicked me even more. 7. I had critical illness cover with my life insurance but they wouldn't pay out because it was DCIS - yet my whole breast had to be removed - I obviously should have waited until it was threatening my life so that they would pay the benefit we have  been paying towards all our working lives. 8. I was made redundant from my job of 18 years - I believe as a direct result of all the time I had off sick & they didn't trust that all treatment was finished with no repercussions.  There was no way I could prove that reasoning & didn't have the energy to fight it. 9. I am working in a part time job, but cash flow is so bad that I have not been paid since December.  I have applied for at least a dozen jobs, had 5 different interviews but no-one wants me anymore. 10. We are struggling financially big time - as a result of my redundancy - as a result of the cancer! VERSION TWO 1. I lost someone I thought of as my best friend but realise now that she wasn't worthy of that loyalty from me. 2. I lost a breast - but I didn't need chemo or radiotherapy because they \"got it all\".  I struggled with that concept for quite a while but I'm a survivor & the counselling really helped me to regain my sense of self & strength. 3. I am only on a low dose of anti-depressants - it's only 1 tablet a day & if it keeps me sane & above that thin line then I don't mind taking them.  I'm not ashamed to admit I need them. 4. Because I had DIEP reconstruction I ended up having a tummy tuck & I love my new flat tummy.  The scar is a reminder of how far we have come & that I'm a survivor. 5. The scarring on my new breast is fading fast, my surgeon has said he will keep 'adjusting' the shape  & size until we are happy with it.  I have my second lipo-modelling procedure booked for 3 weeks time.  I feel I can talk to my surgeon & tell him how I feel about what needs doing. 6. Shame the critical illness didn't pay out, but then life doesn't always go how you want it to.  We are still appealing against the decision because of the way they went about it but, if they don't pay out, well I'm still here! :-) 7. I was not happy  in my job & did not get on with my work colleague who is a very loud & negative person - the last thing I needed after everything I had been through.  They chose to pay me a lovely amount to go even though I planned to start job hunting as soon as I was well enough to return to work.  Thank you very much :-) 8. I am working in a part time job, but cash flow is so bad that I have not been paid since December - hopefully my wages will catch up with me soon.  At least working is getting me out of the house so I am not at home moping.  I'm still looking & the right job will come up at the right time I'm sure. 9. We are struggling financially big time but we have learnt what is important - we are stronger than ever as a couple, & my sons stay in touch more than they used to.   I choose to live by option 2 - yes there was a time when I was in a very dark place but life has to carry on so I keep my glass half full (well, maybe a quarter full but it's nowhere near empty!) Apologies for such a long post, hopefully everyone can see where I am coming from & what I am trying to say.

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. I was actually meaning permanent jobs although it would be office not manual work. I've not applied for jobs for a long while (been in my current position 18 years) but I thought the disability question was often on job application forms. I am also confused by the NED comment and wonder if there are exceptions?  If so, then does the disability point still apply to me? To explain, my BC was DCIS - on results day after the MX  I was told I didn't need chemo or RT because they had \"got it all\".  Everyone was acting so excited and the nurses kept saying how happy they were for me! So you can see my confusion - am I clear of cancer or am I NED? If the former then am I covered by the disability clause and do I declare it on application forms?  I do have the white 5 year medical exemption card so I don't pay for prescriptions for 5 years but that was issued at initial diagnosis before my final results.  Thanks again Jacky (aka Confused)  xxx",

I am still on the antidepressants but I know I need them, there is no shame in that so if you think you need that little bit of extra help then be firm with your GP.  Good luck, I hope you get this sorted & get that help you need. xxx",

I had my right side MX Nov13, then DIEP reconstruction June 2014.  I am really pleased with the reconstruction although I have had one small lipomodelling op & have another scheduled for March.   I always said I wouldn't bother with nipple reconstruction because I had been told that they flatten over time.  However, I am now wondering if I was too hasty.  It's not just in the mirror that I notice, but also at intimate times.   Even if it does flatten, at least there would be 'something' there.  What are others' views please?

Do you mind if I ask how long it took for your stomach to settle down?  I am now 7 months post DIEP but my tummy still goes very tingly & swells up quite a bit towards the end of the day/early evening.  I did mention it to my surgeon & he checked it last time I was under anaesthetic (Nov14) but he didn't find anything wrong. It does worry me though - I did take photos at night then early morning & the difference was extreme! (can't find the photos now though)  :-(  Going back to your post, how do you know your partner will freak out if you don't give him the opportunity to see your victory scars?  Have you tried talking to him about the fact you feel you need to hide your body from him? Sending lots of love Jacky xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Hally Thanks so much for your reply.  It is good to hear from someone who is ahead of me in the process to give me some idea if my recovery is on course or not. I think I was having a bad day on Sunday, maybe overdid things Saturday & was suffering for it which made me tearful - hence the silly 'woe is me' post! I see my surgeon again on 19th August & will definitely be more assertive about the bulge above my breast - I do want to know what it is if only to put my mind at rest. I have started walking to our local shop each day to try & build my strength up, & I can walk to work when I return so not being able to drive may be a bit inconvenient but I can get round it.   As I said, I'm not worried about being made redundant - in fact I hope they do - but it's the not knowing that is stressing me out.  There are only 2 of us in the office & they sent a letter to both of us saying they were considering cuts in the staffing of the office, so being under threat of redundancy isn't really anything to do with the breast cancer.  If I'm honest I really don't want to go back & am checking our post box every morning - as you said though they can't make me redundant because of my illness so I think they will wait until after I return so it doesn't look that way. Thanks again for replying, I know DIEP isn't as common as other types of reconstruction so wasn't sure if anyone would be able to advise me  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi all you wonderful people!  I mean that, I'm blown away by how great you all are & how supportive of each other even though you are going through it yourselves!  That's not my reason for posting though - I got carried away! I'm looking for advice from anyone else who has had DIEP reconstruction please.  I am now 7 weeks post op - I was originally told I would be off work 8 weeks so now I would only be a  week away from returning - but hubby got my GP to do my certificate up to 1st September which is actually 10 weeks post op. I feel as if I should be further recovered than I am, don't get me wrong I feel fine in myself but am concerned by a few things. I have what I can only describe as a large vertical bulge above my new breast but to the side so it is towards the centre of my chest.  Below the bulge I have a dip in the new breast where the scar is but I'm sure this would flatten out if the bulge was not there.  I have pointed it out to my surgeon every time I have seen him & he has checked it but said it's OK - but it is very tender & I want to know what it is & if it will go away (it's not getting smaller)! Yesterday I tried to drive but didn't last any more than 3 minutes before I had a pain alongside the bulge. I did have a large cushion under the seat belt to protect my breast & tummy but the pain was where the seat belt would have been touching if I had not used the cushion.  That area is still tender now but wasn't before yesterday. Sorry if I sound like I'm whining, I feel as if I'm doing nothing but complain when I was doing so well! I love my new flat tummy and only have one small scab left so I am bio-oiling the scar & it's improving no end.  My tummy keeps swelling up though even if I don't do very much. Yesterday I bought a lovely new jumpsuit to wear out for a meal with family last night.  It looked really nice on, was not tight & looked very slimming.  I felt great & had a lovely evening!  However, by the time we got home my tummy had swollen up so much that the jumpsuit was pulling at the buttons & you could see my tummy flesh through the gap created - I couldn't believe it!  I was sat down the whole evening! How long does all this take to settle down?  I am really tearful today when I was feeling so good in myself but feel as if I've regressed.  Technically I should be back at work in a week but luckily I have a bit longer.  I am under threat of redundancy so don't want to take longer off sick.  To be honest I don't mind either way if I am made redundant or not, but the not knowing is stressing me out & I don't think they will do anything while I am off sick, so I would rather not be off for longer! Apologies again if I sound like a whinge bucket!  I realise I am very lucky compared to some of you who have been through, & still going through hell.  I recently attended the funeral of a friend who lost his battle with cancer so yes I know I got off lightly! Sending big hugs to everyone on here.  Take care of yourselves xxxxxxx",

I am (was) office manager for a small company.  I had 4 months off early last year after a knee replacement.  When I went back everything had changed.  I was told by the one employee below me that she no longer reports to me.  Other parts of myjob hadbeen takenaway too and were not given back. I tried to ask the powers that be if I was still office manager and was constantly ignored. When I finally pinned the boss down I was told the lady in question had gone up in their estimation because she coped so well in my Absence.  3 months later when I went off sick again - this time with breast cancer - I was still correcting mistakes made while I was off the first time.  This time I did as much work as I could from home partly to keep my own job and partly to avoid the stress of her mistakes!  I am now about to be off again,  this time for at least 3 months for DIEP reconstruction and am really worried about about what will happen to my job this time.  I automatically get blamed for any invoicing errors (charity jobs as they call them) but every error found I have traced back to a mistake made by 'my assistant'. I don't need this added stress on top of coping with breast cancer and losing a breast!  I so wish I could afford to tell them to stick their job. I can't even look for something else knowing I am due further surgery.  Sorry for the essay, this issue really stresses me out and once I get going. ........

      "Content": "Hi Jives68 Mistmoley beat me it :-) I had a DIEP reconstruction on 23rd June & came home from hospital yesterday - exactly 2 weeks later.  My surgery took 9 hours, this length of time was because they checked the new breast as I was coming round afterwards & were not happy with something so they rushed me back in again to correct it. I could not be happier with my new breast - of course it is still very bruised & the scars (breast & stomach) are still scabbed in places but I can see how great it will look when all healed. My tummy is still very swollen & feels tight when I stand straight but again I can see it will be flatter when the swelling has cleared.  The first few days after the op, I was walking very stooped because of the swelling/tightness in my abdomen, this caused back pains but mainly because I have a curved spine so have to be careful with my back.  Making sure I sat fully supported helped & the pain soon calmed as soon as I rested. My reconstruction was delayed in case I needed radiotherapy so I waited 7 months from mastectomy to reconstruction - I must admit that emotionally that was the worst 7 months of my life, however I am now ready to draw a line under this whole episode and move on.  I feel like me again, the person I was before the whole cancer diagnosis roller coaster took over my life. I am very surprised how well I am considering it is only 2 weeks & DIEP is major surgery.  This morning I showered & washed my hair (I did put a stool in the shower so I could sit down if needed) - & this evening I peeled the potatoes for hubby to cook dinner. Small tasks do tire me out but it is early days & I am sure my recovery will progress well. I am sure there are others here who can also advise on DIEP but I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have.  Feel free to friend me if you would rather chat privately. Best of luck whatever you decide xx",

My surgery (DIEP flap) was almost 8 weeks ago although it did take 9 hours so that is a lot of anesthetic. This surprised me though as I thought it would be out of my system by now.

      "Content": "HI I had my mastectomy on 27th November and I also had the tissue expander. I am due to have my first saline 'inflation' on 24th January. I know they don't like to start the inflating until the wound is completely healed - I am nearly 6 weeks post op & still have one scab, albeit a tiny one. I met a lady at our local support group who couldn't have her first scheduled inflation because she had knocked a scab and the wound was weeping. So I don't think the dates are set in stone, it will depend entirely on how your wound has healed at the time of the first appointment.  I personally would still go along for the appointment as the surgeon then does get to check the operation area and see how you are getting on.  I know it is annoying to have to arrange another appointment and transport with being so far away from the hospital but it is the end result that is the most important thing. Good luck, & make sure you tell the surgeon of any concerns  Jacky xx ",

My right breast is a third the size of my left.  I tried lots of different types of bras but find the best ones are the elastic over the head ones.  They have a soft cup inside each side - what I do is remove the cup from the left side and put it into the right side,  so the mx side has double the soft cups. Also,  because the expander is higher than my remaining floppy breast,  I use needle and thread to adjust the shoulder strap on the left side to lift it a bit more.  I find this goes somewhere towards balancing them and giving me a bit more confidence.  I hope this helps xxxx",

I have only been in this community a short time but have seen partners come on here asking how to support their partners because they won't talk to them so they are at a loss of what to do for the best! I know my hubby is really struggling through this process as much as I am but he constantly tells me we must keep the communication open in order to help each other through this process.  Isn't that what marriage is all about - supporting each other equally? I ordered some publications from Cancer Care Uk, one of them is written for the partners of women diagnosed with breast cancer - so I ordered that one too, we have both read it & even jokingly remind each other the book says we have to communicate & tell each other exactly how we feel.  These reminders sometimes cause tears & sometimes cause laughter but we are getting through this together. This is the link to the book, their publications are free although I did make a donation but that was my choice: http://www2.breastcancercare.org.uk/publications/diagnosed-breast-cancer/it-together-partners-people-breast-cancer-bcc120 I really hope this helps & that you manage to open up to each other Jacky xx",

I don't know if you are on Facebook but we changed our profile and cover pics to messages of hope and positivity for the new year.  We couldn't have been more wrong - yes hubby found work which I am grateful for but his contract is extended on a monthly basis so we can't plan for the future.  And here I sit with only one breast.  Again I know I'm one of the lucky ones as they got it all so I don't need chemo or radiotherapy.  Yes I am grateful for that but I am not grateful to have had breast cancer and now only one breast,  I am dreading going back to work - it was hard enough going back after my knee operation but now I don't feel like a normal woman and I have more painful surgery ahead of me with the reconstruction. I know they will expect me to be back to normal but I'm in no way normal.  Sorry for the rant - in summary yes I agree - they can all keep their 'happy new year' and 'next year will be better' cos I've heard it all before and it didn't get better - it got worse.  Yes I'm angry,  partly at myself because I'm normally such a happy positive person but not any more!

I had lots of tests at the hospital but it wasn't until they got the results of my first biopsy that they said \"it is definitely cancer but we need more tests/scans\".  I know discharge is one of the symptoms but even that does not definitely mean cancer - I have occasionally had discharge from both breasts for years & yes I was found to have cancer in one of them but the other was checked thoroughly & is clear.

      "Content": "Wow, what a worry.  I don't think you are over-reacting at all! I do wonder how much of this is her Mother's doing?  To give you my experience (& trying to cut a long story short) - at the age of 17 I was in a job that was unsuitable for a inexperienced 17 year old & I became very down.  I didn't want to take the job in the first place but it was the only way I could leave school where I was also very unhappy - Mum worked at the same place so allowed me to leave school if I went to work with her as it was a 'respectable job'. After a while she realised how much I was struggling & sent me to the doctors for anti depressants. The doctor signed me off work & I never went back as I eventually found another job (a lot lower status in my mums eyes but I was happy there).  I always felt I didn't live up to her expectations despite trying very hard. I never did take the anti depressants that were prescribed at the time, something inside told me not to. I am so glad I made that decision as I believe 17 to be too young to start on the road of that type of medication - obviously there are exceptions, I'm not saying this is wrong for everyone. It sounds to me that at 15, your step daughter is very easily influenced by her mother (as I was) - & it sounds grandmother too - and has obviously been conditioned to seek attention through symptoms she has found through the internet.  The idea of counselling is great as hopefully that will give her the understanding to think for herself (hopefully she will attend the sessions unaccompanied!). Not sure if all the above is relevant to your question, I was trying to put myself in her shoes.  I totally agree to give the counselling a try first before any medication but I am not sure if you can do anything about this.  You obviously care deeply for your stepdaughter so I can understand your worry, & I totally agree it is too soon in the process to put her onto Prozac. If your relationship with her will allow it, could you talk to your stepdaughter & suggest she waits to see how the counselling goes before starting on the medication?  I am sorry to say it but it does sound like you are stuck between a rock & a hard place as her mother may not like it if you do try to influence her at all. Whatever the outcome, I wish you & your stepdaughter the best of luck. I'm sorry if none of the above helps, your post struck a chord with me & I felt compelled to reply! xxxxx",

I think it's a case of once you are in the system (ie had a scan) then they do everything as fast as they can - even if they have told you something different, I presume to just cover their own backsides if they do take longer. Please don't take this as meaning they have found anything sinister, it could be a matter of one more patient off their books once they have given you the good news. As others have said, if that isn't the case then you have lots of support & will get through it xx",

I think my body clock still needs to adjust after waking up in pain every few hours. I'm trying to be more active during the day but that just means I sleep deeper for the first 3-4 hours then bang I'm awake!  I have found the best approach is to not worry about it. I read a book or play on my phone until I get sleepy again - and there is no rush to get up in the mornings.  Good luck with having the drain out - I worked myself up into a right state about mine being taken out.  The BCN told me to take some deep breaths and I was shocked when she said it was all done as I didn't feel a thing.  I was convinced it would hurt as mine stayed in longer as output was high and was causing me a lot of pain. I hope you have a good Christmas - let your family look after you,  it will do them good too knowing they are doing something to help Lots of love",

      "Content": "I had my first saline expansion this morning, he added 100ml of saline.  I was surprised to feel pain when the needle went in (as it is quite numb) but apart from that is was fine.  It is now feeling a little tender so I have taken paracetamol & have ibuprofen on standby if I need it. Before this morning, I was very conscious of being lopsided with the mastectomy side being smaller. Now, I am still lopsided but the other way round although not in quite the same way.  The saline expansion seems to have created what I can only describe as bulk higher up my chest so it now looks like I have one breast much higher than the other. This is only the first expansion so I am concerned this will gradually get worse with further expansions.  My next appointment isn't for another 8 weeks so he is leaving plenty of time in between expansions. My surgeon is great & has said he will lift the other one, although I am being referred to another hospital for the DIEP reconstruction so I'm not sure which of them will deal with that.  I don't see how lifting my left breast can make such a difference though as it will still be in the same place obviously. I wondered if anyone else has experienced this & how it turned out in the end? Thanks in advance Jacky xx",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah I fully understand how you feel!!! I was diagnosed with DCIS (ductal cancer in situ - i think) end of October after a whole month of at least one scan or biopsy every week for the whole month. I had a right side mastectomy 27th November. I had a skin sparing mastectomy (mastectomy is often referred to as mx) because I will be having reconstruction.  The surgeon refused to do the reconstruction at the same time as the mx in case I needed radiotherapy as apparently that kills new cells, so they saved as much skin as they could & inserted an empty expanding implant behind the pec muscle.  The implant will be slowly 'inflated' with saline to stretch the skin then, at a much later date, I will go back in to have that removed & flesh/muscle inserted form my stomach to form a new breast (at some poin tthey might lift or reduce the remaining breast so they match) I think I was more upset at the prospect of losing my nipple than the breast - my nipples are very important to me! I am now very lopsided and because the implant is behind the pec muscle it flexes when I move - like a body builder flexes his muscles - not nice to see & especially not feminine! Everyone tells me how lucky I am that they got it all so I do not need chemo or radiotherapy - \"me lucky?  I've lost a breast & was it really necessary?\"  I want to shout that from the rooftops.  One minute I wonder if it was necessary because it was obviously contained so not threatening my life, the next minute I'm grateful they caught it before it became invasive.  The surgeon told me it was definitely cancer but I've even had one friend tell me it's not actually cancer if contained so not spreading. One thing I do know, I will never be the same person again that I was before all this happened.  I  know I am having reconstruction eventually but it will not be my own breast & I don't think I will ever feel feminine again. I feel as if part of what makes me me has been removed & no-one can ever really understand how that feels - even others who have had mx won;t fully understand because everyone is different & thinks differently.... I am due back at work in 2 weeks time but have been very unhappy there because of a work colleague who is very bolshy & negative.  I feel as if I have been through so much this last year (I also had a knee replacement 11 months ago) that I am no longer the same person & I truly believe I am too old & been through too much to have to cope with her attitudes.  I have no choice but to go back as we need my salary - I am even working from home at the moment as we can't afford for me to be on SSP.   All of this is stressing me out so much, I'm not sleeping so end up in bed until lunchtime each day as I feel so drained all the while. Sorry I have really waffled & ranted so much, I wanted you to know that I understand where you are right now.  I won''t say it gets easier because that doesn't help with how you are feeling at this moment in time but believe me you will get through this & you have come to the right place for understanding and support. I'm sure others will also comment and very probably be more helpful than I am - this is a great site with lots of love & support Sending lots of love & hugs (wish I could do that physically but you are very probably miles & miles away from me) Jacky x",

      "Content": "Hi H It is natural the way you are going up & down in your emotions & outlook - & very healthy. My story is that I had a needle biopsy 25 odd years ago & was told nothing to worry about as it was just blocked glands. So when my first ever routine mammogram picked up a lump 2 months ago I was very blase & adamant it was nothing. I went through all their tests - ultrasound, mammogram, needle biopsies, MRI all still convinced they would say it was nothing - only to be told I had breast cancer & needed a mastectomy!  OMG I hadn't even considered that as a possibility & I don't think it has really sunk in until this week now I am out of hospital & drain is out.  I hate looking in the mirror & take ages deciding what clothes are baggy enough to hide my lopsidedness. Not telling you all this to scare you, but so you realise that your anxiety is good because it means the idea is there in your head.  I really hope yours ends up to be nothing & that you are worrying for no reason!

      "Content": "Hi Paul I read back through this conversation when I saw your reply to MistyMoley.  I think you may have misunderstand her comment as she did not say that it is her opinion but \"There's a common belief that breast cancer in men isn't as devastating as it is for women.  However cancer is frightening whatever it is and you can't help but worry.\" Cancer is always frightening & the diagnosis itself is enough to put anyone into shock regardless of whereabouts in the body it is.  However, I can see where this belief comes from - as a woman, my breasts are a major part of my femininity so losing one of them has effected me immensely, especially as I have a badly scarred & misshapen left leg since childhood so my legs have always been hidden away under jeans whilst my friends were wearing short skirts.  Hence I have always lacked confidence & believed my boobs & bum were the only nice & feminine parts of me. Please do not think anyone is downgrading how you feel, we all react differently to the diagnosis & whatever surgery or treatment is necessary. Good luck for your mammogram next week, & I would advice that you tell someone if only for the support you would receive.  Everyone on here says it is best to take someone with you when you receive the results as you tend to stop listening if the news is not what you want to hear - I totally agree with that, my hubby has been my rock throughout this ordeal! Sending good wishes your way! xx",

      "Content": "Hi TattyaniaJane   I had DCIS, pre-invasive cancer my surgeon called it.  I had right side mastectomy on 27th November with expander implant.  Are you having lymph node extraction too? Mine were clear so no need for chemo or other treatment.  Which means I am now in limbo - only one proper breast, a third of a breast (or stump as I nicknamed it) & waiting for everything to heal before they will consider reconstruction & making me feel something like a woman again. I can so relate with your \"so why am I losing a breast?\" - my biggest question was & still is, \"if it wasn't threatening my life then why the ***k did they remove my breast?\"  When I am thinking sensibly I know it was done as a preventative thing - if it had been left then I'm sure it would have eventually threatened my life - but being sensible isn't very easy when you are on this journey is it? Believe me, what you are feeling is completely normal!!!!  The hospital referred me to a counsellor - one of the things I said to her is that it is a relief I didn't need chemo but, if I had needed it, I might have felt I was doing something to fight this b**t**d disease and the mastectomy might have made more sense.  She told me that a lot of her breast cancer patients in the same boat as me (ie no chemo or RT) say exactly the same.  Made me feel a little bit more normal! Please feel free to add me as a friend, we can then email or even text if you prefer - you are welcome to rant to me and I will very probably say yes I understand, so stop beating yourself up! By the way, I am now back at work part time & have overdone it so back in pain again - take it slowly, do your exercises & get plenty of rest.  Just as importantly, if you need to cry then cry.  & keep commenting on here because everyone is really lovely even if we don't feel we have as much right to be here as some of the members!

I was off work for 2 months but worked from home a few hours a day during the second month - out of financial necessity rather than anything else.   The fact you asked that question I think you already know the answer - the emotional healing is the worst, I will be honest I am really struggling but that doesn't mean you will be the same, everyone is different!  I think my problem is that I was so strong beforehand, I was telling everyone exactly what I was having done as if I was talking about someone else - maybe I really believed it was someone else then the reality really hit home when I got home after the operation. As for 3 weeks off work - I asked my surgeon how long I would be off work for - his reply was \"physically 4 weeks then emotionally another 4 weeks, so 8 weeks in all\".  He was right, in fact I wasn't really emotionally ready to go back when I did but in a way it has helped because I put my 'work mask' on & get on with the job which means I can forget about my problems for those few hours a day.

Sometimes I can feel it start to tingle & swell during the evening - but, as you said, it is not painful. I hope this puts your mind at rest that the tightness is normal.  If your reconstruction was Nov14 then it is still early days for you.  I have sometimes had to remind myself what major surgery I had (9 hours) especially to the tummy area as I'm sure I am prone to overdoing things, mainly because I feel so much better.

At my local hospital (Kettering Northants) they hold inter-departmental team meetings every Wednesday so they can discuss results and make sure they are all in agreement -eg pathology results agree with what was seen on the scans.  'Results day' is then Thursday so depending on which weds meeting the results are available for waiting time is generally 1-2 weeks. I hope that makes sense.  I know from experience the waiting is very difficult but the breast unit were fantastic and most appointments were only days away even though I was told each time they would be within 2 weeks.  Best of luck and please let us know how it all goes xxxx",

She told me she has had quite a few clients who have had mastectomy & reconstruction including with the LD flap method & they have all gone to to a full recovery with no extra back problems caused by the procedure - and these are people who already have back problems. Because the curve of my spine is so obvious to the eye, my surgeon agreed to not go for that option, but the info from my chiropractor just goes to show that the LD option does not necessarily cause ongoing problems/weakness. I hope this reassures you. xxx",

It has been said lots of times on here - DIEP is the Gold Star of reconstruction & I feel privileged that I was suitable for this type of reconstruction. As Mistmoley said, try to think of it as your own flesh rather than where it came from.  I was told if this didn't take then they could take flesh from my bottom - no way was that ever going to happen as my bottom is the only feminine part of me I have left lol!
