      "Content": "Hello,  My mum had her surgery last Wednesday on both breasts. She's struggling on a number of levels, not least that she's still feeling the side effects from the chemo (last tax was five weeks ago). I think if she could just get some better sleep it would really help but she's finding it impossible to sleep on her back and it's too painful to lie on her sides. I just wanted to check if anyone had found a way of sleeping/getting comfortable after surgery or can think of anything else that would help.  Any ideas much appreciated and thanks for your time.  K",
