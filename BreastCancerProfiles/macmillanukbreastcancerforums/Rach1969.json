      "Content": "Hi all,  I've been taking Anastrozole since Feb of this year, and now for the last 3 months or so I have experienced itching on my arms when I'm too hot. It seems to come on if I've been out and then when I get back indoors. I sometimes have a red rash with this too, but not always. I first noticed it when I got back into my Dad's car after an appointment at the hospital. I notice it when I return home after a walk to the shops. Today I had the same itchy session come on when I had a hot flush indoors, on this occasion I had not been outside. The itch is like a prickly itch which eventualy goes on it's own after I spend time rubbing my arms. The strangest thing is that it only really tends to be on my arms and hands. I have not changed any soaps or washing powders so it can't be that causing it. I have also recently experienced it after getting out of the bath.  Has anybody else experienced this itch whilst taking Anastrozole? It is driving me crazy, and I can't get a quick appointment with my GP.  Thanks in advance. Love Rach xx",

(under the low income scheme). You need to fill in form HC1 (which you can order online or get from job centre or hospital), send it off, then you will get your HC\"certificate through the post. Order as many of these as poss, I think 5 is the max as your money situation might change more than once. Mine did. I was originally on statutory sick pay from work, then went to ESA of which my payment changed twice. I currently get full help now....FREE DENTAL & EYE TESTS, AND FULL VALUE OF A VOUCHER TOWARDS THE COST OF GLASSES/LENSES, FULL REFUND FOR TRAVEL COSTS.  It all adds up. I have just booked a dental and sight test whilst I can get it free :)  The HC2 certificate lasts for a year, then you can apply again if still needed.  Rach xx",

      "Content": "Hi, unfortunately my planning of radiotherapy was like yours. I explained that I was struggling with my shoulder, and it was very uncomfortable for me to get my arm into position on the stirrup (I could feel pulling and burning down my upper arm, & pain in my shoulder). They fetched me some painkillers, sat me in the waiting area for 30 mins then tried again. It wasn't much better the second attempt. They gave me 2 options - go back to the physiotherapist and delay the radiotherapy or simply crack on with it. I chose to try it again, and breathed my way through the pain and discomfort.  I have been referred back to the physiotherapist but will only manage to squeeze in 1 session before my radiotherapy date (19 Dec). I am worried that each radiotherapy session will be painful for me, and that is before any soreness occurs from the treatment itself. I think it will be a case of taking strong painkillers before each one, and fingers crossed it will be bearable.  My thoughts are with you, I know exactly what you are going through and the worry you have about the radiotherapy.. WE CAN DO THIS! :)  Love & best wishes, Rach xx",

      "Content": "Hi  I had quite a few physio sessions, more so for my shoulder than my arm. I had to have a full lymph node clearance from my armpit, then a drain in for nearly a week. It was during this time that I began to nurse my arm around the drainage bottle in fear of it being tugged (holding my arm in like an 'L' shape). Once the drain had been removed I still held my arm in this position, plus I could not stand the feeling of my arm next to the side of my body as it felt like there was a log there due to the nerve damage. I still do not like the sensation but it's getting better. This 'L' shape has somehow pushed my shoulder forward, as it still is now. I stopped the physio as had to start with chemo and could not juggle both of them.  I continued to do the exercises from the breast surgery but they were not the right kind of exercises to correct my dodgy shoulder position. I think it will take a while to correct that. I have a cream that I was prescribed for nerve pain, maybe you could get some to.  I'm glad your treatment seems to be more bearable for you after taking painkillers, I shall have to do the same thing.  Good luck , Rach xx",

My chemo nurse once told me that it looked like cradle cap.  I washed my hair yesterday using the T-Gel, and for the whole of the day my head was really, really itchy. The itching has calmed down again today but my scalp is still very dry and flaky. I think I should give up on the T-Gel. I have not been using conditioners or styling products for a long time now as my hair is still short.  I think I'll look into the Moogoo. I have my 12 follow-up appointment with my breast care consultant at the end of the month, I'll see what she suggests.  Thanks again Ronstar. I hope I find a solution too :) Rach xx",

My boob is still tender, I have a frozen shoulder, and I'm worrying about everything. I'm fed up of having to get my boob out, and having to put on hospital gowns. Even the idea of going back to the breast clinic where I was diagnosed terrifies me. Horrible memories have come floating back into my head. How do I mentally prepare myself for this mammogram? I know I won't sleep tonight worrying about tomorrow.  Rach xx",

The nurse kept telling me to stick my bottom out, twist my hip this way and that way. I never had to do any of that before. She never told me to hold the handle things, which I did at my first mammogram last year.  I felt like I was in there for ages.  As for the results, she said I will receive them in 3-4 weeks. I have an appointment to see my breast care consultant in June.  I've also received a letter to make an appointment for my routine smear test...............when will I be left alone? lol  Thanks again LondonLass, Rach  xxx",

      "Content": "Hi,  I suffered terribly with vein problems during my chemo. I had 6 FEC-T, and I was effected during both the FEC and the T.  I was never advised to have a line put in. I am now nearly 2 months post chemo and my veins are an absolute mess on ny chemo arm. I am unable to straighten that arm, and when I try I experience a painful pulling sensation in my arm joint (front of elbow) and down my arm where the unsightly veins are. I have never been told to do anything to help this, even though I have recently shown my arm to the Profs/Onco.  Exercising has not improved my veins at all, but it is very important that you keep up with your excersise the best you can.  Other than using a pain relieving gel/cream I don't think there is much else you can do.  Maybe it is worth you asking for a PICC line if you think your veins will get worse. Best wishes, Rach xx",

On seeing my consultant at the hospital today I was told that all my bloods were ok, but the one for my platelets was still pending. Two hours after leaving the hospital a nurse rings me stating that the blood for my platelets had congealed or something, and that I now need to have more blood taken. Back to the hospital I go, and 2hrs later, with having 2 different departments trying to get blood, and with 3 different nurses trying, using different areas on my arm, wrist and hand, they only managed to get a capful. None of us have any idea whether this is enough to test my platelets, so not sure if my chemo will go ahead tomorrow. The nurses spoke about me having a PICC Line inserted now. Do/did any of you have one? This is grossing me out a bit. xx",

      "Content": "Thank you Julia,  yes I meant hormone therapy not HRT.  No doubt the Onco will recommend the FSH test, if not I will mention it myself.  You mentioned the 2 drugs, Tamoxifen & Leftozole depending on whether a person is pre or post menopausal. That is what I am querying because I will not be able to have Tamoxifen if I am pre menopausal due to the blood clot, so what then?  You're damn right about the Fragmin injections. They sure do sting and cause bruising. I have started to inject my thighs now instead of my stomach, and it's not so bad. The key is to inject slowly. How long did you need the fragmin for, and did you need to go onto a tablet form after the injections? Thanks Julia, best wishes to you  Rach xx",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am often asked by the medical team when I had my last period. My reply is 'I do not know as I was on the mini pill before being diagnosed with breast cancer, so obviously did not have periods'. I am 47 years old, stopped my contraceptive pill back in May but still have not had a period. I have heard that chemotherapy can stop them (of which I had), but how do I know if I am actually menopausal or not??  I am currently having daily injections of Fragmin as was diagnosed with a blood clot in my leg just over a month ago, I have to inject myself for at least 3 months. Because of the blood clot my Onco consultant informed me that I would not be able to have Tamoxifen for my HRT as that can cause blood clots, so would have to take something else (I can not remember the name of it).  My question is, how do they know what HRT drug to put me on if I and they do not know if I am menopausal or not?  Does the HRT start after Rads?  Thanks , Rach xx",

I ask this as it is not an effective treatment while the ovaries are still producing oestrogen, but I read that it is sometimes given alongside another drug called Goserelin which stops the ovaries working.  It was my medical Oncologist who told me that I would not be given Tamoxifen because I have a blood clot already. I'm assuming they willo just have to give me the blood test (GRRRRRRR! Another needle! GRRRRRRRRRRR! More blood! ) Thanks anyway Ronstar, best wishes to you  Rach xx",

I hated that wait, and thought it very cruel considering all I had already been through. I did ring my GP surgery to see if they had received their copy of my results, and was a tad relieved that they hadn't.  I shall certainly be telling my breast care consultant about the horrendous wait.

I had Docetaxel, and found that I had less hair loss than with 'FEC', hopefully it will be the same for you. I have even read that some people notice their hair growing during 'T'. I also used the cold cap throughout my chemo.  I found this info from a site - 'Even with breast cancers, the effectiveness of scalp cooling depends on the type of chemotherapy regimen. Patients receiving medication from the taxane-class (like Taxol, Taxotere and Abraxane) usually fare better than those treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (like Adriamycin, Ellence and Daunorubicin), which is more aggressive in causing rapid and complete hair loss.' So from that, I would personally be feeling positive about 'Abrazane'. I hope that helps you a little.  All the best Sacha, love Rach xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I have recently had my first councelling session with the genetics team as my mother had breast cancer at 41, her sister also had it, as did her daughter.  There is the BRCA 1 & BRCA 2 gene. I am also being tested for other genes that are responsible for a person developing breast cancer and other cancers such as TP53, PALB2, PTEN, STK11 & CDH1. This is because there are a lot of different cancers on both sides of my family.  It is important to understand that a woman who inherited an altered copy of a gene may not necessarily go on to develop cancer in her life but her chance of developing cancer is increased. The BRCA genes can affect males aswell as females. There's breast & ovarian cancer in women, & breast & prostate cancer in men. So If I do have the altered gene then there is a 50% chance that my Son also has it, and my Grandsons.  My blood has been taken to check for all the possible altered genes, and I will recieve an appointment to return to see my genetics counsellor when she has the results which should be within 2 to 3 months time. It is a very expensive test.  I think you should definitely talk to your oncologist. They will be able to refer you to the genetics team.  All the best, Rach xx",
