      "Content": "Can anyone out there tell me how they cope with hot flushes during the night????? I seem to be spendin MOST of my time in bed fighting with the duvet....I sleep on the window side of the bed with the window oopen most of the time....Shaun my partner is great and doesn't comment very much about my nightime activity but I'm sure I must disturb him. During the day I can cope with them as I can walk around and even go out side when I am at work.....But the nights are becoming sometimes quite difficult as I am loosing quite a lot of sleep as well. I thought they had all but stopped prior to the chemo but now I am on my 4th of 6 they seem to have gained momentum at a fair pace!....sometime every hour.... Apart from sleeping in the bath......any suggestions. Jan.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all you comments and help....... I already do the 4.5 tog duvet...and sleep in the buff.....always have done...... actually last night didn't seem as bad but some nights I almost dread getting into bed. I am seeming my oncologist very soon and will ask about the chillow....No problem of course with my head as that keeps extremely cool........Once the bonnet comes off it becomes the coolest part of my body. I am about to have my 5th session of chemo........do you think that things might get a little better once the chemo has stopped.? Jan.",
