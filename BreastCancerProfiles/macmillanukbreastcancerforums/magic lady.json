    "Content": "My hair fell out within two weeks of starting chemo but I had already chosen a very good and very nice wig. I shaved my head because the wig fitted better. It was heartbreaking as I have always paid great attention to my hair - as in style and colour etc. My hair has now grown back - about an inch and a half all over but I'm still wearing my wig. Choosing the wig was interesting. I tried loads - was fun really, the opportunity to try out all sorts of styles and colours. I chose a completely different darker colour and can't wait for my hair to grow back so I can have it dyed and cut to the style of my wig. Everyone compliments me on my new hairstyle and genuinely don't know it's a wig. Cost me about Â£70 NHS Every cloud etc etc :)",
