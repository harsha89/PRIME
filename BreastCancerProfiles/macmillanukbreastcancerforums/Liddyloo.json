Olive oil is an old trick for superficial burns and very good, nothing in it.. ",

The creams the RT folks suggest are not always that useful. We get long term side effects in tissues from the RT, on the delicate inner tissues of bladder, vagina and bowel. The effects are far reaching, even to swollen legs from damage to pelvic lymph nodes.   One thing we've been debating is the use of hyperbaric oxygen to combat the effects and aid healing. There is some hopeful evidence coming out of America. Here it seems to be self funded, but it isn't mega bucks. There is an information booklet on the Mac site about it.  ",

You can make your own with 1 teaspoon of salt to a pint of warm water, and use as often as you like. I couldn't use a conventional toothbrush, electric is far the best with child's toothpaste.
