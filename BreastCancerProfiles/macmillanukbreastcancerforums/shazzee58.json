      "Content": "Hi Liz, After my lumpectomy last year, I was given the choice to have chemo as well as radiotherapy.  After the consultant went through the \"predict\" sheet it said my chances of non-recurrence was 75% + 6% with radiotherapy and 5% with chemo.  I was quite happy with an 81% chance of it not coming back and wasn't willing to go through months and months of chemo along with it's nasty side effects and risks for just 5% more, so I declined and just had the rads instead and anti hormone tabs instead.  It's been a year now and I've had my first follow up Mammogram and received the results today - all clear. It's down to personal choice and you mustn't be made to feel guilty if you decline too.  All the best to you Liz Shaz",
