    "Content": "Hi Heidi Hope you are still with us. I have found this site and it might also help others www.metaplasticbc.com. Seems to be pretty rare as only three people on the blog. Had BC before but a different type now back in the same breast but Triple Negative Metaplastic. Had a lumpectomy before but this time it looks like it will be the full works. Very little information on this and the medical teams do not seem to know how to deal with this either. Best Wishes R",
