      "Content": "Hi, first time here. Just need some support.  I\u2019m just coming into day 6 post op, lumpectomy and SNB. Feeling violated and in far more pain than I ever anticipated. BN said it was minor op so I wasn\u2019t too worried, just wanted it out, but the pain and post op blues getting to me now. Also the impact of the whole BC thing starting to hit me. Lump picked up in screening and I feel like I\u2019ve been on a surreal path ever since.  The nerve pain in my upper arm woke me up again and the dragging feeling in my armpit is hideous when I walk or sit up.  Has anyone else had the dragging pain? It feels like someone is trying to pull my armpit out.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone but apart from the dawn chorus outside I\u2019m feeling it.  Tearful and overwhelmed.  Emily ",
