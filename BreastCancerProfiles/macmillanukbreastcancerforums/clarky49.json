      "Content": "Hi Highland Mum. I too found that the surgery sideof things moved along swiftly. I was referred to my oncologist  in March but didnt begin my chemo until start of may. It may be different in other parts of the country, I live in Newcastle. I contacted the hospital after a few weeks of waiting but was told that there was a delay because of bank holidays etc!! After seeing my oncologist things started to move along pretty quick and my chemo started within a week or two. I understand your frustration about wanting it to get started, I was the same, the quicker you get started the quicker it will be finished. Good luck with your treatment and stay strong x",

      "Content": "Hi Scarlett.I have just finished chemo and am fue to start herveptin on Friday. I had to have a heart scan in nuclear medicine prior to starting herceptin as this drug can sometimes have an adverse effect on heart fnction (I was told this a not common). My onc informed me that your liver or kidneys are reposnsible for getting rid of many drugs that we take so it maybe that your drug is going to be processed through your kidneys and therefore they are testing their function before giving it to you. Try not to worry as the more test you have the better understanding they have of how your body works. Google not really a good idea even though I have dine this myself, it is tometimes not accurate or upto date. Do you have a breast care nurse you can call they are very good and can maybe put your mind at rest. Good luck with your treatment and try and stay positive x",

      "Content": "Hi Jellytot. Dont apologise for your feelings and I understand you completely. I too have dark days and cry a lot of tears. I found that everytime I read something of spoke to someone who was in a worse situation that me with their cancer I feared that would happen to me. I  have just finished my 6 sessions of chemo and am starting herceptin this week and have found the whole hospital experience very emotional. I can't make things right for you but I can send you a healing cyber hug!!!!!!!!, It helped me to talk to me friends about how i was feeling as I found it difficult to talk to my husband and I too heard him crying at times which is anawful thing to hear. I have 2 children and they were my inspiration to dry my tears on many occassions. Please dont feel that you have to go through this alone, talking helps so much, try to stay positive and I know how difficult this is, I would be wealthy if I had a pound for everytime I heard \"be positive\"  this year but its so true!  Stay strong x",

      "Content": "Hi hulahoops. I was diagnosed in january and have had lumpectomy,lymph node removal and a mastectomy followed by 6 sessions of chemo. I have started tamoxifen and on Friday will have my first session of herceptin. I too have been feeling the \"what next\" syndrome. I think getting back to normal wil takea  little time for me and maybe for you too. You haven been through so much this year. I have been very emotional since finishing chemo but not sure why this it. Every little niggle or pain has made me think it has returned. Do you have a breast care nurse? I found mine invaluable to talk these feelings through with. In my area (newcastle) there is a Maggie centre which is in the process of being set up, they are there for  just the situation you are concerned about. to help ladies learn to cope after treatment so worth seeing if there is one in your area. It is so difficult and I understand your feelings completely.dTry and be positive and keep telling yourself that the bloody vile disease has gone and WONT BE COMING BACK!!!!!!!!, Dont let it beat you.
