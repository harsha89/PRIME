    "Content": "HI as I have eczema and aqueous cream is an irritant to my condition. I discussed this with the Radiotherapist last week before I started my sessions and she said it was ok to use the Double Base cream that I use on my eczema. It rubs in much better than aqueous cream and doesn't just sit on your skin. We also discussed aloe vera gel which was fine but the Radiotherapist didn't recommend using only that as it wasnt a moisturiser. So am using a combination of both. bit early to tell if this is a successful combination for my skin type. regards Judith",
