      "Content": "Hello, I'm 25. I found a lump in my right breast 6 weeks ago. It is hard, doesn't move and is irregularly shaped. My first visit to the Dr's was 6 weeks ago, he touched only the lump and said he could feel it but because of my age to come back in 3 weeks time after I had a period to see if it had gone away. 3 weeks later I went back to the Dr's and this time saw a lovely woman Dr who done a thorough breast exam, she too could feel the lump and decided I needed to be referred for breast screening for an ultrasound and biopsy. She told me to go sit in the waiting room whilst she made an appointment for me and that I'd only have to wait 2 weeks to be seen. She called me back to her office and told me that when she called for an appointment she was told the 2 week rule only applies for women over 40! She was very apologetic.  I'm still waiting for my appointment letter and have been waiting for 3 weeks. I'm going out of my mind with worry, I can't sleep, I have developed terrible night sweats and insomnia in the past two weeks. I was just wondering how long you had to wait for your screening appointment?  Sorry for the long post, I haven't really got anyone to talk to about what I'm going through as I'm a single parent to two little boys and I don't really want to worry my family incase it turns out to be nothing.  Xxx",

I just wanted some advice to see if it was normal to wait so long as I didn't want to pester the GP. However the stress is getting too much so I will definitely contact them tomorrow.  Thanks again.  Laura xx",

Then had an ultrasound which showed it was just normal breast tissue. She just said I have very fibrous breasts. So thankfully it was good news.  Thank you to everyone for the well wishes and advice.
