    "Content": "Hi Kim, I also had a lumpectomy & lymph nodes removed and was also told that the lymph nodes and margins were clear, I have to meet with my oncologist this wk but I have also been told that I will be having radiotherapy and tamoxifen, but there is a chance she will recommend chemo. And like u have been so emotional probably the most ive been all the way through. My husband and I have spoken about this and depending on what is said I think I will have whatever they are offering just to have peace of mind. All my family and friends have been great and so supportive and I feel so guilty that I can't seem to shake myself out of this low spell, i have been so positive all the way hardly crying, but this last few days since I found out I've been a mess crying, snapping I am all over the place. Not sure if I've helped at all but so nice to know someone else is feeling the same as me. Good luck Helen xx",
