      "Content": "Hi, I had my radiotherapy consultation monday and to be honest the consultant explained everything to me, how many sessions I would be having, any side effects I might have. I have had an appointment for a CT scan for next week which you will have before radiotherapy starts. As for hormone treatment I see my oncologist the start of Feb about this, but have a bone density scan booked for next week too as I think I'm going to be having letrozole which can cause thinning of the bones.  Good luck for tomorrow luv lizzie",

      "Content": "Hi Angie I went to my dentist just before I started chemo and had to have a filling, then 2 days after chemo had bad toothache, dentist gave me antibiotics which oncologist said was ok. Further toothache a week later, oncologist said as long as I had any dental treatment done at least 9days before next chemo session it would be ok. Hope you get it sorted, nothing worse than toothache on top of all the other SE  Lizzie x",

      "Content": "Hi Pinkshoe I finished chemo Dec and radiotherapy a week ago and have been on Anastrozole for 6weeks. 2 weeks ago started getting bad cramp like pains in my hands which like you would wake me in the night, I contacted my oncologist who brought my appointment forward to last Tue, my GP had sent me for a blood test a week before and found I'm vit D deficient. The oncologist said this could be what's causing the pains or it could be the Anastrozole. My doctor has given me vit D capsules and the pain doesn't seem as bad so it might be worthwhile getting yours checked. Luv lizzie",
