      "Content": "helsbels18 Hi and welcome,the chemo bag is a lovely idea .  I had fec t (finished with paclicataxol so extended it a bit) and went to all treatmemt on my own. My sil used to drop me off and pick me up,i hate fuss and just couldn't stand the thought of sitting there making small talk with someone or us both looking at tablets /reading,didnt see much point.  What i really appreciated was help afterwards eg looking after kids, help in the house,listening ear etc when i felt grotty that is what got me and hubby through.  Good luck xxx . Thank you xxxx",

      "Content": "ronstar Hi Mamma55 I am in the opposite position to you - I have breast cancer and my (grown up) daughter is the only family nearby and so has to do all the helping! She also had a couple of holidays booked and I would have felt terrible if she cancelled them! I feel that cancer has taken enough from me, I don't want it to start robbing my family too! We arranged for my mum to stay when she was away at \"chemo time\" so that she could relax on holiday and she messaged me every day. I felt so much better seeing the pictures she sent me and knowing she was getting a break. You say your daughter will have other family around her so she will be looked after and you will be able to be there the next time. It is hard when you want to help and are not allowed - I am a very stubborn and self sufficient person and it has taken time (diagnosed in February) for me to let anyone help let alone for me to ask for help!! I go to my hospital appointments by myself - my daughter comes near the end of chemo with a nice coffee for me! Your daughter may soften in time but as long as she knows you are there and knows she can ask for help, then you are being the support she needs! You will worry, of course but try to enjoy your holiday and maybe you will be able to give some practical help when you get back! R . Thank you for your reply, it's really helped, and Good Luck with your own journey, I really appreciate the support I've received on here, thank you xxxx",

      "Content": "Jane h Hi there I can understand yr daughter going it alone. It is a long and boring day and not tbat pleasant. I went alone for first one but what worked for me was people coming in for the subsequent sessions - like for a few hours in the afternoon and then taking me home. You might find that works for yr daughter - maybe for next time. The cold cap adds time and makes it harder but it is worth it in my opinion. It is fine after the first 20 minutes. Foodwise - they do keep offering drinks and snacks at chemo....personally i felt ok during it but it does depend on what yr drugs are. I got side effects a few days after and  then had weird fancies....most drastically cravings for chinese takeaway but again i guess it depends on the drugs. I really hate fuss so just wanted to get with it alone. Sometimes youve just got to do whats best for you.....i reallt appreciated neing looked after once i got home though. Expect your daughter will feel the same Good luck Hi Jane, thank you so much for your reply, yes I think she just wants to do this as fuss free as possible, I totally understand her need for normality, have got her a \"chemo goody bag\" of sweets, mints, mouthwashes, toothpastes, and various other things, I suppose it's all a horrible learning curve, thank you again Jane, and Good Luck zxxz",

I wanted to cancel it obviously, but she went mad at me lol, she will have other family around her but as her mother I wanted to be there for her, she is 35 and so stubborn and proud and wants to do it all by herself, I try to respect her wishes but worry so much for her, she has 4 children, the youngest is only 1, xx",

      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi Mama55  Warm welcome to the group not that we like seeing quite so many new members There is a monthly chemo club here in the breast group as so many who have chemo at the same time - You can find Augusts Chemo Club here. Septembers will start Wednesday afternoon sometime. As it is coming to the end of the month there are quite a lot of pages of messages, please don't be put off by the number of side effect posts. There are a lot of people having chemo at this time and those who sail through chemo don't need to ask questions so you get a skewed view of it all.  There is a 'chemo aid' link in the first message about help with side effects and other helpful hints. Do you know which chemotherapy drugs your daughter is having ? Most here have FEC-T but there are other variations. Ginger Nut and Arrowroot biscuits can help with any taste / nausea issues and Paracetamol an hour before using the scalp cooling cap (ice cream headache) Some chemo units will supply hair conditioner, some don't so she may need to buy her own. There is quite a shopping list to help make this more do'able. There is some information about Scalp Cooling and Hairloss here. Hope this is of some help to start with,. I have a feeling your daughter will soon be wanting some help as this is a tough call to try solo. Take care, G n' J Thank you so much, yes it's FEC-T, Will look on that link now, thank you, and yes, I think so too, am ready when she is xxxx",
