      "Content": "Dont know if this would make you feel any better but I went to gp for something similar to you a few year back.  I had smooth and moveable lumps under my armpits and my GP was a bit like yours and waited 1 week before going.  Mine turned out to be nothing , i think the GPs deal with many things and are over precautious.  Have a good weekend & try not to worry ❤❤ ",

      "Content": "No problem ha ha yes I think Drs seem to put that super serious face on without realising it worries people ha ha !!! I know exactly what you mean though as my gp did the same.  But i bet she was just concentrating. Remember the gps are no experts like i said they see many things daily but are not experts. ... so she may of needed to concentrate more , hench the super serious face.  In my case i was seen in one day i had all the tests which took all day , i just went on my own and like you i didnt tell anyone .... and like you i could not think of anything else.  I had no follow ups or surgery xxx  Have a wine tobight ❤❤❤ you'll be fine xx ",
