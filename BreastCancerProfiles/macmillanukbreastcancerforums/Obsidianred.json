      "Content": "Hi Fiddlesticks (btw love the name) Completely understandable, and you are in good company! The TV thing is easy to set up and well worth it, but I remember how hard it was to focus on anything in the early days. The adverts, while necessary and have a good purpose, are never the less a source of distress for many of us at a time when we just don't need it! I'm happy you are staying positive, it's hard to maintain at first but becomes a way of life.  Sounds like you are doing extremely well, give yourself a pat on the back! Fx",

      "Content": " Hi Fiddlesticks, I'm a bit late to the table here! I , of course, agree with all the support given here and can empathise, but don't want to repeat what has already been said. So, on a purely practical level - My ad experience was the same, and it reduced me to tears often, the hypersensitivity is awful.  My way to resolve this problem was easy, I have cable TV, so am able to set up my amazing magic box to record all my favourite programmes and films. I then watch them 30 minutes later than normal ( or when it suits me)and can fast forward all the ads! Also watching on catch-up cuts the ads. And using the pause button, go away and do some polishing for 15 mins, then you can fast forward through all ads. You can use this in the short term until you come to terms with everything, my experience was that My World suddenly shrunk down to the size of a few rooms and a few people and me, then I let it slowly expand again at pace I could deal with!   In truth, I am still doing this with my TV 4 years later and seldom watch 'live' TV, purely because I lost my tolerance for all ads ;o) My friends all do the same thing! I don't know if you have this capability, but just a thought. There's no way to completely avoid the subject but this made it all bearable for me. Best wishes for you and I hope that all goes well Fx",
