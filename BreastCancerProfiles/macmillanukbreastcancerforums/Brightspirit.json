Surely this is enough to know life is too short to be arguing like this .  Whatever treatment we chose is a personal decision.  You don't have to agree but you should respect each other .It is a support forum after all . I'm stroking the bunnies and rather chilled myself  ",

      "Content": "Hi Blaster, I had two mastectomies,one in 2011 and the other last year due to worry of cancer may returning . I was always adamant I wanted to stay flat,but feelings changed when I was flat . I went on to have a double ld flap last September. It was been a very long recovery for me . I'm just starting to think about going back to work now . Every journey is different but mine was full of ups and downs . Having said this I believe I have made the right decision. I wish you well with whatever you decide x ",
