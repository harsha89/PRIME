    "Content": "Dear Kay, I am so sorry to hear of your troubles at home - how very hard for you on top of everything else you are going through. I write to you as a husband of 18 years of Rachael who has breast cancer and has had a mastectomy and is about to start chemo, radio and hormone. We have been through a lot of sh1t together over the years but this is by far the worst. Rachael has been amazing through this, but it has bee such a struggle for me and I can see that this is the sort of thing that would drive many husbands/ partners away emotionally and physically to move away from the pain.Â  For us, it has been an opportunity to grow closer - an opportunity I say - so it is a choice thing not a feeling thing. I hope your boyfriend sees the value in your relationship and makes that same choice. I have been told by many people that it is often as hard if not harder for those at the 'side' of the cancer sufferer that have a hard or harder time than the patient - powerless to help so much of the time but longing to do so! As a man (biased I am sure) I would say for yourself look at how valuable you see the relationship to YOU and if it is worth fighting for, try and talk through what is going on in him to see how you can work it out between you and come out stronger and in better shape at the end than you could ever have done if you had been fit and healthy all the time. For interest - I had a day the other day when I was explaining to a friend that, for me this cancer was like having my favourite toy, or precious thing picked up by someone on the outside, cut from head to toe, the guts ripped out of it and then thrown down on the floor again in a heap - I would do anything to be the one with the cancer and spare my wife this pain and suffering but can't - just have to observe, try and support and love her..... a daily challenge for a husband of 18 years! Good luck Kay - I hope you discover he is struggling in a way similar to me and that this thing draws you so much closer!",
