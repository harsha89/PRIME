      "Content": "Hi walkkt Welcome to the online community. You are in the right place - we are a very friendly supportive group of people at various stages of treatment, all only too willing to help. My, it does sound as though you have a lot on and it is lovely of you to be trying to support your friend while also supporting your husband. Please do make sure that you look after yourself as well. You are welcome to come here or call the helpline (0808 808 00 00 Mon-Fri 9am-8pm) if you ever feel that you need some support or even just a rant or someone to talk to.  As for how to support your friend - well, we are all different so what she wants will be individual to her - you might find that just having someone who will listen will be enough for her.  Sometimes people don't like to talk about cancer so it can be hard to try to keep the grim reality of it to yourself. I had lots of supportive text messages from friends and colleagues which was lovely, but there was one friend who I knew I could call on for the less cheery stuff - she came and bought headgear with me when my hair fell out, came to see me when I couldn't go out etc. It was just nice to have someone there who behaved as though it was a perfectly normal thing and would be very open about everything. Cancer was pretty much my whole life for nearly a year and she just got on board with it. Chemo can be tough - we have a chemo club thread in this group and the first page has some tips and advice - you could have a read of that or even point her towards it if you feel she might like to come and join us here. I see you've been posting about your husband, so just wanted to let you know we have a very friendly and supportive Family and Friends group if you ever want to chat to others in your position Sending some virtual hugs your way as you may need them - being strong for others is hard work.

My last chemo was 1st September but mine had  started to grow at the back and sides halfway through my Docetaxel. Mine only started to look like proper hair a week or so before Christmas. I see my daughter fairly regularly -at least once a week and one day I opened the door and she immediately said \"wow your hair\" it really did just decide to come back over a couple of days. You could try massaging your scalp to encourage blood to your skin and hair follicles. I don't think it's been that long, though. I am frustrated with my lashes and brows - they are still stubbly and patchy! My chin is making up for it though Fingers crossed yours is back soon (on your head I mean) R",

I notice you mentioned peripheral neuropathy - when I saw the physio, I didn't mention that I had it but she related the pain to damaged nerves. My pain isn't like yours - my muscles are tender to touch and tighten up when I don't move but I wonder if yours could be nerve related too? I have also been walking an hour a day and she told me she thinks it's too much - to do half an hour for a while and even drop that if my legs don't improve - that's a bit more difficult when you have a dog to walk, though. I think you're right to try to get some answers - there are so many ongoing issues after chemo and you may need a different specialist to help you sort it out!  Good luck finding a solution! R",

For the clearance, my surgeon said there is essentially a ball of fatty tissue that the nodes are in and they just take all of that out. They are not his exact words - my understanding of them!

Been having wrist pain on my mastectomy side for a couple of weeks, which seemed to be mainly around the bone on my thumb side. Obviously everything terrifies me right now, just seen my GP who thinks it is De Quervain's Syndrome which might heal itself in a few weeks with a splint or need steroid injections. No known cause but it is thought to possibly be caused by hormonal changes. It really is something when you leave the GP happy that it's \"just painful\" This too will pass R",

When I posted about the ugly inadequate bras I could find, I was given lots of advice (if you search bras you'll find lots of threads, I'm sure) So far I have found Amoena to offer the best size range, but what I am learning is the sizes differ from brand to brand. I had a fitting at John Lewis before my mastectomy and got some great 'normal' bras in 34F. They still fit my remaining breast so my cup size hasn't changed, but I have since bought M+S bras and an F is way too big - I got a DD As far as timing goes - you'll want something soft for post surgery and  front fastening can be useful - if you're having immediate recon they should advise you on bras. I have a couple of mastectomy bras but haven't done any serious bra shopping yet as I had radiotherapy and had to wait for everything to settle after that. I also don't have my prosthesis yet and I'm sure that will raise some other needs!! Now you've reminded me of something I wanted to post. Good luck with your search R",

We are very adept at tiny postural changes to protect our injuries - unfortunately then adds to our problems. If you do have problems with radiotherapy - speak to them - they will find someone to see you. Sometimes it seems like such a little thing after all we've been through but it's a little thing every day - it's wearing! Oh the work thing - to be honest I had only just got back on my feet after redundancy from HE 6 years ago - the funding is so precarious now that there are mainly variable hours contracts (zero hours but they daren't call them that) and their responsibilities to you are minimal -  if you don't take a contract, you forfeit your rights. They can terminate you with 2 weeks notice or choose to make you redundant. It's horrible, and managers use it to avoid using staff who don't put in the unpaid hours etc. If they knew I couldn't do my job as well as before, they just wouldn't give me hours. I'm in London so there's no shortage of potential staff. I'll perk up soon and figure it out - I think it's just that no-one told me this was a possibility so I wasn't really prepared - thought I'd be running and doing bicep curls after 6 weeks - haha!

I had mastectomy and node ckearance in October and all my swelling has gone except a lump under my arm - a few people have looked at it and not really decided what it is - I have had rads and have to wait for things to settle and ask again at the end of this month. I'm having physio for post surgery problems and she thought it was scar tissue. I try to get it tucked into my bra but it's really annoying - I feel for you.  Fingers crossed we both get rid of them soon! R",

      "Content": "Hi I am just moaning, really because I don't want to keep going on about things that seem trivial to friends and family. I saw the breast clinic physio today to see how my shoulder mobility problems are doing post radiotherapy. She's lovely and really informative but said I now need to consider myself back to square one with it all and it's going to take about 18 months to get back to pre-cancer ability. I know I need to be positive - the cancer has gone and I will get it back to normal but it seems a long time. At the moment I don't have enough movement to be able to do my job and I worry about how long it's going to be before I can start earning money again. I have been hiding my peripheral neuropathy and movement problems because I'm not on permanent contracts and I'm terrified that I'll just get discarded or forgotten if I'm off too long. It's just made me a bit sad, really and I needed to get it said. On a plus she said any crankiness and low mood I might experience on Tamoxifen is down to sleep deprivation and not the drug itself! So - looking forward to summer 2018 R",

      "Content": "Hi EJM60 Thanks - it's helpful to hear from someone else with similar problems - yours are more extensive than mine - you've really been through it. My shoulder was injured many many years ago and I think that's not helped. I did my exercises religiously after my operation and all through radiotherapy and now - I'm sure they have helped, I just have to accept it's going to take me time. Unfortunately radiotherapy just tightens everything up - you notice it happening. I took paracetamol and ibuprofen before my first radiotherapy but it didn't help - they abandoned the session, got an oncologist who prescribed me diclafenac, then tried again later. I didn't find it did much for my pain but it's anti-inflammatory and was just enough to allow me to get in to position. Hopefully your amitriptyline will do the trick. Mostly, the sessions are much shorter than the planning - they take images every so often so that takes a bit longer but they should be able to tell you which sessions that'll be. Tell them if you're struggling - my experience was that they are so rushed and 'technical' that they don't always have the people skills you'd like! They used to tell me over the intercom \"you can take your arms down now\" but I physically couldn't, I needed help and had to wait for them to come in. I'm not on any painkillers at the moment other than over the counter - I'm going to go to my GP and see what they can do. One thing my physio suggested yesterday was the Pink Ribbon programme. She knows I'm really keen to get back to some exercise and suggested I look for a trainer in my area. I don't know if that would be helpful for you after radiotherapy - it's pilates specifically designed for post breast cancer patients. I hope the radiotherapy goes well for you! R",

Having said that - it's been over a year and I am still a bit creaky so maybe it is the Tamoxifen. I have always found that gentle exercise helps - the more inactive I am in the day, the more my joints ache. Recently, I learned from a physio that they are beginning to suspect that the hormone therapies cause problems with tendons and ligaments so that would also cause an issue with joints, I guess.  I don't take anything for it, so can't help there I'm afraid - could you have a chat with your GP and see what they suggest? Mine have been very helpful with the lingering side effects. sorry I'm not more help - I'm sure there will be better answers along shortly! R",

I think she (or someone) said the chemo is still in your system for that time. I then had, I think 7 or 8 weeks before radiotherapy. That was the bit that concerned me as they don't want me to start Tamoxifen till rads finish - but the oncologist said it was fine and to be honest, I had enough to take in at the time and just wanted someone to tell me it was OK!

I wasn't offered ovary removal but am surgery averse anyway. I opted to stay on Tamoxifen for a while - my oncologist told me that Tamoxifen will work pre or post menopause as it blocks oestrogen - unlike the AIs which only work post menopause. I didn't want to have to risk the bone thinning. There are a few people who have gone for ovary removal so hopefully they'll be along to help soon. R",

Also, 35 sessions is a lot - well done for getting through that! The team were quite nice about it today, they were going to postpone it till I've had more physio but I think that would mean starting in the new year so decided to try the painkiller option. Hopefully I'll be in the mood for laughs soon! SpicedTea - I saw my physio the other day. The weird thing is I can do the post op exercises but don't have full movement. My physio said it's nerve damage and stretched it out a bit for me - she's also given me extra exercises to do. She thinks it's better to not see me during radiotherapy - she thinks it would be too much. I'll see how I get on with the painkillers, but I can call her if I need!  Thanks everyone R",

But - since surgery in October I have been left with a lump or swelling under my arm - it is really uncomfortable and was causing pain down the inside of my arm when it brushes against it. Everyone I speak to has a different opinion - the radiographer thought it was soft tissue swelling, the physio thought scar tissue, GP thought fluid now the oncologist thinks it's a dog ear and needs surgery! So I need to see my surgeon in 5 weeks!  I am just so fed up of it not being over. I have been doing so well these last couple of weeks - been really positive, got some painkillers from my GP to help the nerve pain which then helped me do my physio so I have a good amount of mobility in my shoulder - I've been exercising, I have a training plan to get back to running, I've set up meetings to discuss going back to work - I've just been happy. Now here I am crying again and feeling that I will never get to wave goodbye to that hospital! Now I can't even make plans to go back to work because I don't know if I'll need more surgery or when (non-urgent so presumably months away) I know it's never really over but I just want to get on with life!  I was terrified of surgery before and don't know if I can do it again, but I don't want to live with this level of discomfort and constant painkillers - but then I'll have to start this whole arm thing again.

I didn't find tiredness a problem though - people seemed to expect it but I wouldn't have even thought about it. To be fair, I'm off work so that probably makes it easier and I had chemo so it's not the complete fatigue I experienced with that. I felt fine to do the rads in the morning then meet my mum and do Christmas shopping on Oxford Street till 8.30 then come home and do dinner, laundry etc so can't have been that tired! Everyone is different but I think, generally it's not a gruelling treatment - I know people who've had it at 8.30am then gone into work every day.

      "Content": "Hi Trojan50 I am just jumping in with an OK view of chemo for you. It is a scary prospect, but everyone is different. Some people suffer bad side effects but lots of us find it very manageable. I had 8 rounds and did quite well. I did have side effects but my oncologists kept them manageable with drugs and although I wasn't working (I teach which is too germ ridden for chemo) I did manage to maintain an active life - socialising, exercising, doing some little projects round the house. No-one can predict how you will react, but please don't be too terrified - it's do-able! Let's hope you are one of the ones who sail through it! R",

      "Content": "Hi Trojan50 Oh yes, the hair loss - well half of the answer is right there - I always forget about it! That's the second part of the answer though - to be honest, I hid in my house for a week at one point because I was so upset - but I had ignored everyone who told me to shave it off and was hanging on till the last of it was gone -that was a mistake for me - once I shaved it off I was fine. I didn't get a wig - I use scarves and bandanas. It sounds daft but experimenting with ways of wearing them makes it feel more like I have hair. I am 5 weeks since my last chemo and it's re-growing - still a little thin on top but it's getting there! Everyone approaches it differently and also I think the weather matters - I went through chemo during the summer and wanted something cool. You could try the cold cap - it takes some commitment but some people have good results with it. It crops up all the time but here is a link to the most recent discussion community.macmillan.org.uk/.../115778 You should get an introduction session at the chemo unit and the nurses explain everything. I found mine to be a great source of help and information with everything chemo related. And of course - keep posting here - I found this site towards the end of chemo but wish I'd found it earlier - there's so much support here!! R",

      "Content": "Hi Really just writing this down to straighten out my thoughts. My treatment finished in December 16 but I've never really felt 'released' because I had a follow-up appointment booked about a small dog ear which causes me some pain. Before that appointment arrived, I developed a seroma which then became infected and for the last 5 weeks I've been seeing my consultant twice a week to deal with that. I had an appointment today and was hoping he'd say everything was fine and I could stop the antibiotics, then I would have discussed the dog ear. But he wasn't there and I saw a different consultant I've never met before - he didn't introduce himself (he might have been the cleaner for all I know) he ran through my history - wouldn't believe me my radiotherapy was in December, insisted it had been October. Asked me why I wasn't having a reconstruction - because I don't want one - but you're young - yes - Well, (shrug) it's your decision - yes it is, thank you. Had a quick look at seroma and said - you don't need antibiotics just finish the course. That's it just go away and you only need to come back for your mammogram. So I explained that I had been discussing other things with my consultant and he said - well, he's not available today. I said that was fine, but I didn't know what to do about them and he just looked at me and said nothing. So I said I guess I'll contact the nurses if I need to and he nodded. It feels like a disappointing last appointment. I wasn't expecting a brass band or anything but I don't know why he felt he could question my reconstruction decision but then not help me with my questions. I feel like I've just been told I'm being a nuisance and been left to deal with the residual fluid and dog ear by myself. It has made me very glad that my consultant was nicer but a bit upset and confused, I guess. I really want to stop all the hospital appointments and glue my life back together, I just wanted a bit more of a plan really. There, it's all out now! R",

It is a like a pepperpot and it contains tiny fibres that you sprinkle in amongst your hair then spray with the accompanying hairspray (actually any \"wet\" hairspray will do and is much cheaper - not anything like Elnett though which is a dry spray) The fibres are a bit like the fibres in mascara and mimic the look of hair. There are a lot of other similar products now and a quick google should find them - they are different to a hair powder though although the packaging is the same so make sure you are buying something that has fibres in and is specifically for thinning hair. A word of caution - your scalp will be very sensitive so I'd give it a test run at home first so you can wash it out if you need to Good luck R",

I understand them asking my plans if it is relevant to treatment but today was a one-off - I just don't see why he felt the need to ask about it - why that is worth discussing with me but my other problems aren't.

There is a link to some helpful things to take with you etc. Everyone reacts differently, but to reassure you - the majority of people with no underlying health conditions cope very well with chemo - I couldn't work because of the infection risk but I went running, met up with friends, did some house projects. Often you need to take it easy because of the risk of picking up infections - so no swimming, gardening for example - rather than that you physically can't manage it.  You could think about having a plan B - someone to call on if you can't pick up your son from school etc. It is usually the first week that is the worst and many people feel as normal weeks 2 and 3. There is a cumulative affect though so you may get a little more tired as the cycles go on. I had a little look at your profile - how is your son managing? If you need any help with that then there is some information about talking to children here but you could also give the helpline a call if you feel you want something more specific.  0808 808 00 00 open Monday to Friday 9am -8pm Hope the first chemo goes well - and all the Christmas prep, of course R",

I was really delighted when someone gave me a nice aromatherapy one and I have since given that to friends having treatment. It really is the little things that make a difference. If there is a coffee shop at the hospital - a voucher for there - I used to have a coffee as a \"treat\" during chemo - there was a free machine there but it was nicer to get one from the shop and have a croissant or something on the early ones. Depending on budget - a nice scarf/wrap - I found my arm got quite cold with one type of chemo in particular and I had treatment over the summer and didn't cold cap - it can get a bit chilly and I was always grateful for something to snuggle up in. They do have blankets there but it was comforting to have something of my own. I was given some puzzle books, wool to knit with, colouring book - I didn't use any of them but they were great ideas - depends on the individual - I used to read a newspaper or be on my phone - planning some travel on pinterest. One of the things we are all really grateful for is people who care and help and she already has that with you! R",

As Optimistic says - the majority ( about 90%) of breast lumps turn out to be something other than cancer so keep that in mind until Tuesday. Of course you are worried and scared and Dr Google is no place to be right now. I won't condemn the internet entirely because it brought me to this site but there is a lot of nonsense and misinformation out there - best avoided if you can. If you can't (it's difficult) stick to reputable sites like Macmillan, Breast Cancer Care and Cancer Research UK. If your worst fears are confirmed and there are cancer cells found - it is very treatable and there are lots of us here who have been through treatment and are looking at our future positively. Success rates are very high for breast cancer treatment. It helps to write it all down, doesn't it? We are here for you as much as you need - if you have any questions about what will happen at the appointment etc - just ask away - that is exactly what we are all here for.

So far just the rampant hot flushes which I hope are settling down (maybe wishful thinking) My oncologist told me it was reducing my risk of recurrence by 50% so a bit different. I read somewhere that the risk of uterine cancer with Tamoxifen is 2% so that would put you in a neutral position. It's a worry - it can cause thickening of the womb lining and increases the risk of fibroids. I guess it's like everything else - no guarantees. I know people who have been taking it for years with no problems. I'm not really being much help - I'd be as torn as you, though I normally go for it in the end. Hope you get more answers soon R",

I do think the 2nd round of chemo is hard - you know what to expect but it sort of hits home what you are going through.  I had a Hickman line for half my chemo - seeing the tubes hanging out of my chest every day was difficult and being able to feel it under my skin used to make me feel a bit ill - I'm quite squeamish. I could also sometimes feel the drugs pulsing into my neck - I got used to it though. Your feeling that it is wrong - do you think you'd like to talk to someone about that? You might find that this feeling goes away, but if it doesn't you will have an added worry every Thursday and Friday - an extra battle you don't need. No-ones body can fight cancer by itself - chemo can be tough but it is helping you. I have just finished my treatment but to begin with I felt a huge sense of failure - I'm quite a perfectionist and cancer is about as far away from perfect as you can be. I felt that I would never be able to look at my life as successful, because I'd had cancer and let myself and everyone else down. I don't feel like that now, but I had to take the time to deal with it - I had a couple of wobbles - wouldn't sign my chemo consent at first and then wouldn't have treatment my first session. It was probably fear and wanting to be in control. We all have our own internal hurdles to get over - it does take over your life so it makes sense that we would have a huge range of personal reactions to it. Have you told anyone from your team what you're feeling? How about your BCN? You might find s/he has come across it before. If not, what about giving the Macmillan helpline a call? Hopefully this will be something that will pass, but try to recognise it as a side effect that can be treated just like nausea. Hope round 3 is easier for you! R",

They go at a tangent to avoid the heart, though this can 'clip' the lung (his words) I think he said it was 3% of the lung. As AntsNest says, they will get you to hold your breath to lift your chest away from your heart so it is missed entirely. They have very clear images of you and you are measured and placed to the mm each time. Sometimes they will ask you to breathe in or out a little more so that they are spot on with it. I understand your worries, but they really are very thorough and precise with the treatment. My team didn't decide on radiotherapy until after my chemo, mastectomy and node clearance (I was sort of borderline) but I feel better that I've had it - reassured I've had everything possible! Merry Christmas to you! R",

I am just teaching one person for one day - I used to be able to do this kind of thing blindfolded with one arm behind my back but I have knots in my stomach already that I'll mess it up. Any reassurances welcome. The other thing is - because I am still having problems with my arm and hand which restrict the work I can do (I teach Hairdressing so really need both hands/arms fully functioning) I am applying for some other, more administrative jobs. I am polishing up my CV and, obviously there is a big gaping hole in it of nearly 18 months. I know we are protected by the equality act etc but I also know that isn't always a reality when firms are picking from a pool of candidates. Has anyone else navigated this? I'm not sure whether to address it in the covering letter, hope for some interviews and see what happens or find a way to hide it altogether. I'm conscious that along with my age and the fact I am changing direction after 20+ years teaching, I don't look like the ideal candidate! What do you think is the best way to tackle it? R",

I have mentioned before that I have decided against reconstruction so can't offer anything there but I had an awful experience with the plastic surgeon so thought I'd tell you what I would do differently. If at all possible take someone with you - I didn't and wished I had (only time I've felt I needed someone there) Write questions down before you go but I'd also have pen and paper at the ready when you go in to jot down questions that occur - my consultation was very much a rehearsed presentation/performance that I was not expected to interrupt - when I tried to ask a question, he continued to speak over me!! If you want to discuss anything you've researched/read - have it with you - I was dismissed with a wave of the hand a couple of times and ended up taking the questions to my breast surgeon instead who answered them without hesitation. A lot of my questions were about recovery, recurrence, symmetry etc and he just did not want to discuss those things. Challenge them there and then and ask for a referral to someone else if you need to. I am confident that I would have decided against recon anyway but the surgeon influenced me negatively without a doubt. At the end of the consultation he said \"So what do you think?\" and I said \"After speaking to you I think there's no way I want plastic surgery\" and he waved his hand again and said \"well that's up to you\". I discussed all this with my BCN and told her I couldn't let him make me a breast while I was unconscious - it would increase my anxiety around the operation far too much. She completely understood that it was a trust issue and that I needed someone who I felt was in tune with my thinking. Anyway - don't mean that to worry you unduly - some people clearly find his approach adorable or he wouldn't have any patients. Hopefully your surgeon will be much more to your liking! The best advice I was given was by a friend who has had an LD flap plus implant then implant reduction and nipple reconstruction. Remember that they like doing surgeries, they do them all the time and they probably get bored by routine procedures - they will always want to try out new things and recommend future \"fixes\" Probably a little true I have my psychological assessment tomorrow for not wanting reconstruction - I'll think of you Good luck!

Has anyone given you any indication of how much improvement hormone therapy will give you in terms of % decrease in risk of recurrence? I'm sure that if your oncologist has recommended this as a course of action, then it's probably not increasing your risk over 3 months. Have you tried switching brands? Some people find some relief from symptoms that way, though any professionals I have spoken to tell me there is no reason this should be the case, but it works for a lot of us. Also, getting used to the lack of oestrogen can take time, though I completely understand you not wanting to continue with those side effects. Even if you haven't been through menopause yet, there are other options like Zoladex injections with an aromatase inhibitor (AIs are what they will give you post-menopause) or ovary removal. Do remember that people only post on here when they have problems - there are plenty of women taking these drugs with few or no side effects.

All sorts of things happen to your body after surgery - it's a very long process of healing and it takes months and months to settle down properly. You are, presumably, worried that it's recurrence? Wouldn't that have shown up on your mammogram and ultrasound too? This is a difficult process that we go through - learning to trust our bodies again. We all panic at the slightest thing - and in some ways that is a good thing (I put off getting my breast checked out because I was so certain it was yet another cyst) but when it is causing stress and worry, it can take over our thoughts a little and impact on our life more than we would like. Those of us who have been where you are, can tell you that it gets easier but it can be hard to entertain that idea while you are going through it. I couldn't have imagined a day when cancer wasn't on my mind the minute I woke up. Lots of people here assured me I would move on - and I have, but I wasn't convinced at the time. So what I am trying to say is - I am sure that there is a simple explanation for what you can feel, but it is natural to be worried at the stage you are at. In time, you will worry less.

I am assuming they left the skin in place so you could have an implant further down the line? Even if not, don't worry as that remains an option for you later - I think someone on here said they had one 18 months after treatment. I am taking a guess that you are still in hospital? I am pretty sure they will talk to you about your next step either now or at your check up - I chose a mastectomy and they still kept telling me I could have reconstruction, so they will get a new plan with you. Now for the practicalities - as  Kacang said, they should give you a softie for now - they are pretty basic - a beige triangle which comes in small medium or large - but they should combine them until they find your size and your BCN should help with that. Don't worry - I imagined mine falling out, getting mishapen, all sorts but actually I haven't even been for my prosthesis fitting yet and surgery was 4 months ago. I just shove the softie in and go. I also would recommend a pre-form cup as it disguises any uneven size issues (mine were pretty uneven before anyway) I think it probably varies depending on where you are but I got very little support from my BCN regarding bras. You will need your post surgery bra for now - if you had one already it's probably fine - you want softness, support and some compression the first couple of weeks. I'll put some links in for you re bras at the end. You are entitled to a silicone prosthesis on the nhs - you should get an appointment for a fitting either at your hospital or somewhere still local. Like I said, I haven't had mine yet but my BCN assures me you just know when you've found the right one - I am imagining it very much like Harry Potter in the wand shop, but might be disappointed. The mastectomy bras are pocketed so you slot the prosthesis or softie in the pocket. Actually, as time has gone on, I have thought more that I will prefer the softie or a knitted knocker as Kacang says. I am knitting myself one in beautiful yarn so that I love it and it gives me some control.  Don't worry about looking at your 'chest' (we need a better name for it) take your time. My surgeon told me not to look at it straight away. It changes as time goes by anyway. First - here is a link with photos of mastectomies - naked and in clothes - it's very much about choosing a mastectomy but may help reassure in terms of looks. http://breastfree.org/ You have the amoena link already - I think they do the best in terms of size and variety but there are more accessible ones too. Debenhams do a large range and also stock amoena m.debenhams.com/.../post surgery bras M+S do a small range - I am linking to one I bought - it is completely lined so the elastic is covered which makes it more comfortable - I wore it for rads and it didn't irritate at all www.marksandspencer.com/.../p22354463 I've just seen they sell foam breast forms too for £18 so if you don't like your softie... Here's the knitted knockers site if you want to request one (if you want to knit one-yell. Kacang passed the patterns on so one of us can give you those) www.knittedknockersuk.com/ Hope you are recovering well surgery wise - I am happy to send you masses of links etc if you want them or answer questions - the bra issue was and still is massive for me - we'll all be beside you through this - you will get to where you want to be!

I was always advised to pre-load with paracetamol for the Docetaxel pain - it doesn't seem to work too well if you take it once you have the pain, but if you take it regularly (4 times a day - whatever the instructions say) then it seems to have an accumulative effect It sounds like they are well organised with the dental work too!

If the itchiness isn't constant then it could just be that it is getting stimulated when you wash it - too much scrubbing or water too hot? If your GP thinks you have a scalp condition like psoriasis etc then the T-gel is a good option as it is designed to treat those things. You could think about your conditioner and styling products - if you are still using the same ones then maybe go without them for a few washes and see if things change. (Not easy, I know) Finally, I'll share my experience. I've had itchy flaky scalp since my teens and have been a hairdresser for years - used T-gel, prescription coal tar shampoo, all the shampoos marketed for dandruff, organic shampoos, expensive shampoos, cheap shampoos, baby shampoos etc etc nothing helped Someone told me to try Moogoo products and I didn't even bother looking at them for about a year - then things got so bad I just couldn't cope so I gave them a try and they've worked for me. That's all I use now and a few styling products that don't cause me problems (trial and error with that) However, that isn't a guarantee they'll work for you - it really depends on what is causing the problem.

If you are driving daily to appointments, don't forget to ask if they offer free parking (most do), and it's a good idea to keep moisturising the site of treatment, for weeks after too. Here is a link to the  Radiotherapy tips  thread which contains all sorts of tips posted by breast group members to help you get through radiotherapy. Good tips are: drink plenty of water; use plenty of cream and keep applying for a few weeks after. Radiotherapy can be tiring so rest when you need to. There is some extensive information info about Breast Radiotherapy and Possible Side Effects both on the BCC website  There is also a useful Macmillan video here You can use this link to refer back to the March Chat if there was something there that was useful. We will be closing it to new posts soon. Wishing you all a smooth ride through this part of your treatment! R",

My surgeon did not favour draining and told me to compress it - are you trying that? I wore tight sports bras and it was helping a little. I ended up with an infection there - really random thing that migrated from a throat infection so please don't worry about it happening - and an abscess so was getting it drained twice a week and it eventually healed up. It left me really bumpy and tender for a while so I'm not a fan. They were talking about another surgery if it didn't reduce, but thankfully I didn't need it.

      "Content": "Hi Resilent Welcome to the online community. I'm not sure if Shartom is still using the site, so thought I would reply instead. My seroma got infected last year with a sore throat bacteria. It took some doing to get rid of the infection - lots of draining - twice a week at the hospital. I also developed an abscess at one point.  The problem with seroma's - as you will see from the other posts, is that they tend to refill as soon as they are drained so lots of surgeons seem to prefer not to drain them. If they get infected though, it's very difficult to deal with the infection as there are no blood vessels etc in the fluid, so no way for antibiotics to get there efficiently. In this situation it becomes more important to have it drained to get rid of the infection. That's how my surgeon explained it to me - (except he used a really really extended metaphor about an island in the sea :)  ) My GP told me I was \"incredibly unfortunate\" to have an infection in the seroma so I don't think it's very common. I don't know anything about the Biozorb, I'm afraid but the fluid from a seroma is usually clear yellow - well, if there's not a problem. It looks like pee, basically. If it's a more opaque yellow then could it be pus? Some of that drained out when mine was infected. Sorry I'm not more help - maybe someone else will be able to reply with a bit more info - there are quite a few technical problems today so hopefully there will be more replies when they are sorted.

      "Content": "Hi commoner I meant to reply to your post when it first went up but got distracted - sorry! You've had loads of helpful advice and have settled on your decision which is great. I was in the same situation as you just over a year ago and I appreciate what you are going through - it's a hard decision. I just wanted to let you know that I worried so much about how a prosthetic would feel - whether it would ride up when I went running, if it would be obvious because it moved differently to my other breast - how it would feel to sleep on my front with only one breast - oh so many small but frightening questions. What happened is that I knitted myself a knitted knocker and took nearly a year to get round to getting my prosthesis. I've only worn it once or twice - they aren't too much of a faff - just a quick wash with soapy water at night - I just prefer my knitted knocker. I go running with either my knitted knocker or the post-op softie they give you - a sports bra keeps them in placel - M+S do a good mastectomy one - as do others, I'm sure. Now, I don't even notice that only one breast is real - sometimes I have to have a sneaky feel when I'm out, because I can't remember if I put it on or not! I did just want to mention about double mastectomy because you said you had considered it. I asked for both breasts to be removed with no reconstruction. My surgeon wasn't keen and preferred me to wait until after the initial surgery to see how I felt. I got approved for it but then changed my mind. My surgeon has agreed to keep it as an option for me later if I want it. So - although it is a hard decision and you are happy that you are making the right one - it doesn't have to be a final decision and if you decide in time, that you want a bilateral or you want a reconstruction - they may still be options for you. Glad you are feeling better about it! R",

I was very fit and active and independent and strong, but I have had trouble with my recovery. Some of it was just dumb luck - some was my own fault for pushing myself too hard. I would say it took me a year to recover physically and there are still some things - swimming for example - that I think are still beyond my current capabilities. I had chemo, mastectomy, node clearance and radiotherapy. Really, the reason for explaining my experience is that I had the simplest surgery because I was very focused on getting back to work and to running, but have still struggled. I don't wish I had chosen a different option - I am fine with my flat side (though it took time) but I wouldn't ever recommend it to someone as an easier option because everyone is different - I can have mx and have problems, others have reconstruction and have no problems. It is a factor to consider, of course, but it's not a guarantee that things will be easier. I am sure you are more sensible than me (that's not hard) and your recovery will hopefully be quick. I like the Michael Jordan quote: \"I\u2019ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I\u2019ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I\u2019ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed\" that keeps me going. Good luck with the decision and all the treatment. R",

I was a bit over the threshold on diagnosis - 47 - but do feel a lot is geared towards the older woman - even the magazines in the waiting area.  My BCN was actually quite focused on work issues but I really liked the older BCN there because she had a maternal way about her and my mother lives 250 miles away and still works so couldn't spend a lot of time with me - I really wanted that more than being able to relate to her. We are all so different. I agree about the info on support/charities etc. Even a piece of paper with some websites on would be nice - my unit has a dedicated information area and I will fess up I never went in there for info but it is used as an overspill area for waiting and I only saw Macmillan and BCC info there - nothing local. For sure they don't know about knitted knockers because we've had a discussion about it. I think that might be an age related thing - they don't seem up to speed with online things - my daughter (who is 25) once commented on it, she said that in most jobs you are expected to have a wide understanding of your area and you would research anything remotely connected, but they seem uninterested in learning about anything - I think it was the lack of interest that bothered her, she was expecting an enthusiasm that just wasn't there. I love the mentor idea - I know some people have been connected with others who've had certain surgeries and I felt very alone with that (it's how I found this site) so someone I could have emailed would have been very welcome. The one thing I didn't like about being considered young was the assumptions that were made about the surgery - there was an assumption by the whole team that I would have a reconstruction because of my age - they even wrote to my GP telling her I was having immediate reconstruction. I just don't think I would have had to defend my choice of no recon so much if I had been older. Enjoy the focus group - let us know how it goes R",

      "Content": "Hi SpicedTea That's great news about your path report! So you can start to get some normality back once your pain eases!  I will get my results on Thursday - very nervous but trying not to think about it! I didn't have any drains - my surgeon said they prefer to let the body reabsorb - it's not been too bad so far - he suggested I would grow a new breast but it's very slight swelling so far. Hope yours aren't too uncomfortable - it's all a lot to cope with isn't it? I cannot believe you got stung! We take every precaution we can and then get floored by a little insect - it's not fair! I got bitten by a spider after my final chemo and ended up in hospital 3 days - I was furious - chemo nurses thought it was quite funny and I suppose we will think that too one day! Really the last thing you need. Sorry you're still needing the painkillers -  It will be worth it though - this time next year you won't remember the pain and everything will be settled and healed. I understand you not feeling like celebrating - it's so good the cancer has gone but we're a while off being better! In this last week I think I've cried more than in the 8 months since I was diagnosed! Every time I do my exercises I go through the \"it's not fair, I've been through enough!\" routine. The surgery was always going to be the hardest part for me emotionally but it's been harder physically too. We will get there though - I have to keep reminding myself there's a little progress every day. I used to tell my students to remember they were once babies who couldn't walk and they fell down a lot when they were learning but they didn't just give up, they got up and had another go and now can walk and run without thinking about it!!! Soooo difficult to take my own advice Really hoping you are feeling better soon - physically and emotionally! Sending you hugs R",

The hospice suggestion sounds good - do you think some sort of physical therapy might be helpful? Physio to stretch muscles or massage to loosen? I am on amitryptiline and naproxen for the pain in my chest and arm but they don't help a great deal. The physio is very slowly starting to help though. I have found this also in the past when I had debilitating back pain from an old injury.  Good luck getting it sorted - you absolutely deserve to live your life without pain! R",

We are all hiding how we really feel to protect each other. What a messy business cancer is.

I was due to sign my consent form on Monday and they called me in today to do it - think they are worried I'm going to change my mind!!

      "Content": "Hi Been reading your posts about the loneliness thing. I think loneliness and being alone are very different. I love being alone but I'm not lonely - I have family and a social group - I'm very friendly - just sometimes I like some solitude. I would also assume that there are other factors at play - like you both said - women tend to be social creatures so people who have created a life without friends and partners likely have some other personality traits or habits etc that might be having an impact. My mum is almost friendless - she has really only ever spent time with her family - but she's a really negative person - critical, pessimistic, doesn't really like anyone etc. She doesn't value herself much either - a couple of years ago at Christmas she didn't want to trouble her GP when she knew she had a urine infection and ended up in hospital a couple of days later with failing kidneys. That kind of behaviour wouldn't do well with breast cancer recurrence. In some ways, we can all see it as positive - like you said we are interacting socially here so we're doing well. It also means when we decide to lessen the stress or work through the bucket list, we might actually be helping more than we know. Carolyn28 - you might be on to something with your macmillan socials idea! R",

      "Content": "Hi I have, for now, given up alcohol (not entirely - I'll raise a glass when apropriate) because there is a proven link with certain cancers including breast cancer. None of the other popular ideas around food have been proven so I will bear them in mind but not cut them out of my diet. I am 48 - since I left home at 19 I have eaten very healthily and for the last 15/20 years I have avoided processed food and make everything myself. I don't eat refined sugar or high sugar foods (high carb foods) I aim for at least 7 fruit/veg a day, I never have meat more than once in a day and I often have meat-free days, I avoid too much red meat, I drink plain water during the day, I don't like dairy but have a portion a day as I have osteopenia, I eat 'superfoods' every day and vary my diet as much as possible to get plenty of anti-oxidants and the full range of vitamins, minerals and nutrients necessary for good health. Got cancer though! That's kind of why I find it hard to believe diet is the answer - I was never eating that way to avoid cancer, it was about feeling well and having the energy for my lifestyle and I will continue to eat that way (during chemo was a different matter) but I know it's not a good diet that will make the difference for me. We know that all our cancers are different, our lives are different, our genes are different so it's possible our solutions are going to be different too. In much the same way that hormone therapy is a treatment for some breast cancer, maybe dietary changes are relevant for certain breast cancers. Ultimately, I think we need to do the things that resonate with us and that we are comfortable with. There's no point avoiding recurrence and secondaries if you are going to resent every mouthful you eat for the next 30 years never knowing for sure whether it's working -  it's a balance. R",

We are always here for you - and your mum if she ever feels like joining herself - and we will support you as she goes through her treatment. We do have a Family and Friends group if you want to connect with other people in your situation - maybe share experiences of supporting your mum. You can join in with as many or few groups as you want, and you are always welcome in this group - we are a large group and friendly and as helpful as we can be.  Hopefully your mum doesn't have too long to wait until her CT scan and treatment plan.

As toxophilite says, this is a busier group and sometimes posts slip down the list a bit and don't get seen. I was ER+ Her2- and I had the EC/T regime. The drugs are prescribed depending on individual circumstances so although we may think our diagnoses are the same, there can be subtle differences to oncologists that lead them to a different drug regime.  I had my chemo by infusion which generally took about an hour and a half for the EC. I did get them to slow the C bit down though because it gave me a bad headache. It's a frightening thing to go through and it's important that you have confidence in your team. You could ask them about the speed of the injections - there might be a good reason for it to be different - or you could ask in our Ask a Nurse section. They are very knowledgeable and aim to reply in 2 working days. Just out of curiosity, I wondered if you are in the UK? We have people here from all over the world and things can be quite different in different countries. I hope that chemo is being kind to you and you are not experiencing too many side effects. You might want to take a look at our breast cancer chemo club thread. It's a place for everyone going through treatment to share their experiences - it can be a great support and source of information.  Take care R",

My treatment finished in December 2016 - last chemo was September 2016 - I still have a bit of peripheral neuropathy as well as nerve pain in my arm from the ANC and tendon inflammation in my wrist. I have just gone back to work - I've been off 2 years. I'm still not able to do everything I used to at work. Not all of us bounce back the way we think we will, but you will get there. You could speak to your oncologist about the Letrozole - some people find different brands better but there are also other AIs they can give you. It is also possible to go onto Tamoxifen - that works for pre and post menopause - the AIs are a more recent treatment and research has shown benefits to switching to them post menopause but if they are ruining your quality of life then you might want to consider your options - or at least discuss it. Hang on to the positive of the good nights sleep from the amitriptilyn - I take it for my nerve pain and have never slept so well in my life! It is still quite soon after your treatment - you are still in recovery, so be kind to yourself - don't rush back to work. Hope you find some relief from the pain R",

I can work through your bus scenario as it would relate to me, that might give you a rough idea. I was grade 2, ER+ node involvement. Predict gives, I think an 11% improvement in survival over 10 years for having chemo Let's imagine we are talking about seats on the bus as I can't bring myself to 'off' these women - even in theory! Without chemo - I would climb the stairs but there would be no empty seats - with chemo there would be 4 empty seats (I am rounding up) I like to think that means there might even be one by the window! Chemo wasn't presented to me as a choice but I had already said I wanted every treatment going - that's me. When you get your results, try to push your consultant into giving the information in terms you understand - they possibly have some diagrams or resources they can use. Take care R",

      "Content": "Hi wombat.23 It's a tough one - we are going to dwell on something - is it better to dwell on the what if's of the past or the future? I first went to the breast clinic in 2004 - reassured it was a cyst (it was) and told I had 10 cysts in one breast, 15 in the other. I was told to keep checking for changes - I did but probably got complacent. February this year, the largest cyst was painful and felt harder - well no prizes for guessing why! It was 52mm, there was a second one and it's gone to lymph nodes I have spent time chastising myself but have forgiven myself now. One thing I am able to remind myself is that at my first appointment in February, my consultant examined me and said - wow they are really lumpy breasts! - he told me he couldn't  feel a definite lump but as it was lumpy he sent me for mammogram - it was fairly clear from that. Breast cancer is one of the few cancers that we are able to detect ourselves so that puts undue pressure on us to do so and to feel guilty when we don't. However, we are not great at finding them - the drive to check your breasts every month did little to increase detection, doctors miss them, radiographers miss them, consultants miss them - and they are trained and experienced at finding them. Of course you might have found it earlier, but imagine if you didn't find it when you did - imagine finding it in 6 months time and wishing you had found it now. I like to take comfort in cliches - if life gives you lemons etc. The overwhelming characteristic about cancer is that it is random - we didn't ask for it or cause it and we don't deserve it.  I prefer to look ahead - this is what I have - what can I do to minimise my risk of recurrence and secondaries - I might be able to do something about that - I can't do anything about the past. Crucially - try to forgive yourself because you did nothing wrong. Hope you are soon feeling less cross with yourself! R",

When I was first diagnosed, I told my consultant that I was happy to have whatever treatment would give me the best outcome and have not asked for statistics - I had 2 tumours, grade 2, lymph node involvement so have had 8 rounds of chemo, mastectomy and node clearance - radiotherapy next! If they advised me to do the whole thing again - I probably would. That's easy to say, though as I have no underlying health issues and have fared quite well through treatment.  What I do have is a cousin with multiple severe disabilities - we grew up together and I have watched him go through countless treatments and survive sometimes against the odds. He is an inspiration to me and I can tell myself that what is happening to me is nothing to what he has been through and if he gets up and gets on with it every day, so will I. This is to say that we are all different - different lives, attitudes and experiences so only you will know the best thing for you.  What I would say is if you are otherwise fit and well, chemo may be very manageable for you - it was for me. I wish you all the best with making this difficult decision! R",

There is no need to apologise - we are here for everyone - my treatment finished nearly a year ago - I stick around and may still be here posting in another 6 years! We are a large friendly group who can understand how you feel - we have members who finished treatment a few years ago - maybe they will be along in a bit. Getting a cancer diagnosis is a traumatic event and different people take different lengths of time to process it. Counselling can help - I won't suggest calling your BCN as you don't seem to have a rapport with them - how about your GP? They can refer you to someone who has experience with this. You say you can't find any good news but you are 7 years on and that is a strong positive. Emotionally you may be struggling, but just as you had treatment for the physical symptoms of cancer, you can have treatment for the psychological ones too. Now, there is a good article that one of our champs - Kacang - has as her signature. I'm sure she won't mind me stealing it for you! It's here.  It's quite long but will hopefully be useful and show you that you are not alone feeling as you do. We also have a Life after cancer  group if you are looking for people in a similar position - but we are more than happy to have you in this group. Hopefully you'll get some more advice along soon!

She did say she didn't think it was approved but she was just going to prescribe it anyway.

They are really good at treating breast cancer and will be working towards the best plan for you!  You probably won't be able to stop your brain working overtime until your plan is in place. I'm sure you'll feel better after your appointment next week. I'll just share a little of my story in case it reassures you! Diagnosed in February- the original plan was chemo to shrink my (quite large) tumor then lumpectomy surgery. The day before my chemo was due to start I was told there was probably another tumour in the same breast and I tipped up for my first chemo knowing I would now need a mastectomy. I refused to have my chemo - insisted on re-negotiating my treatment plan, got handled very gently by the chemo nurses and the oncologist and finally agreed to return for chemo the next day and follow the original plan because that was the best chance at that point of stopping the cancer spreading! Had all the information been available at the start, they would have recommended surgery first but that was just not how it happened! In hindsight - they were right of course and since researching and speaking more calmy to my doctors I can see that I was just scared because it was all happening so fast! There is no reason my outcome should be any different even though my treatment feels like the wrong way round to me. You can't help worrying but make sure you shove some positivity in there too - look around the posts on here - there are lots of inspiring people and outcomes! Whatever your plan, you will accept and adjust and you will be feeling so much calmer soon - it's hard when things move fast but how fantastic that they do! Good luck with the plan and the treatment and hoping it doesn't seem too long till your appointment! R",

I was also told repeatedly that it wasn't in my lymph nodes but then told it was after sentinel node biopsy. It was a massive shock but doesn't necessarily mean it has spread. The lymph nodes are meant to catch intruders and stop them spreading so hopefully they have done their job! I had a CT scan, bone scan and MRI as part of my diagnosis before treatment but I knew I was having chemo from day one. These tests are standard at my hospital - it gives a clear picture of your overall health as much as checking it hasn't spread - having the tests doesn't mean they think it has spread! My treatment wasn't the same as I had chemo first then a mastectomy so they did a node clearance along with the mastectomy. I know different hospitals do things differently and other people will come along with their experiences but my hospital remove nodes if it has spread and advise radiotherapy if it is in 3 or more nodes. The situation you all find yourself in is horrible - it's hard to believe but once your mum has been given a treatment plan it gets a lot easier. I finished treatment in December last year - it took nearly a year and when I look back, sometimes I can't believe it happened - your mum and you will get through this one day at a time.

I had very dense, lumpy breasts with lots of benign cysts - they all look grey - I have never been able to tell the difference between the cysts and the tumours (which are now gone!) During one scan, the doctor even told me how hard she was finding it because we knew there was a second tumour but she couldn't tell - she went by size in the end. So - don't ruin the next 2 weeks worrying - hopefully it will be something benign. All the worrying in the world won't change things, it's just draining! Distract yourself and keep busy! We will all keep our fingers crossed for you - let us know your results. R",

Don't panic too much about chemo. A lot of people find it very do-able and stay well. It isn't something we'd ever recommend but it also isn't anything like you are probably imagining.  Lots of people manage to work through it and carry on an active life.  I can understand preferring to have the surgery first - knowing the tumour is still there can be difficult but there are a few positives - you will be scanned part way through treatment so you will have an idea of how well the chemo is working  you will be doing chemo when you are at your fittest - my surgery knocked me for six - if I had felt like that before I started chemo, I don't think I'd have handled it so well. If the tumour is smaller, greater chance of clear margins You should be well looked after during chemo - I found everyone in the unit very kind and understanding - I had a few wobbles. My advice would be - take all the drugs they offer you and feed back very clearly any side effects. They really don't want you to suffer in silence and they have many options - sometimes they don't bring out the big guns (more expensive guns) unless they know they need to, so let them know exactly how you are coping.  And - keep on top of your hygiene and temperature and call them when you need to - even if you think it's nothing and it's the middle of the night. They really don't mind. Good luck with it - let us know how you are getting on. R",

I also wanted to say that I never had drains for my mastectomy - I was told to keep compression on it (bra and softie cushion) and the fluid was left to reabsorb - it took about 5 weeks - so it isn't inevitable that they will want to drain it, if they think it will go.

Though none of us would choose to find ourseves here, it is a friendly place with lots of support from people who completely understand. It is amazing how much better you can feel by having some space to let it all out! I always felt my medical team were drip feeding me to some extent - I think they sometimes try not to overwhelm us. It is true that things may change after your mastectomy but I wanted to reassure you that many of us handle chemo very well. It isn't a breeze exactly but is very do-able.  As you are finding - the waiting and the not knowing is hard - it really is the worst bit. Once you do get the results and know what your treatment plan is, you will feel better and can just take it one day at a time till one day it will be over.

She also had a couple of holidays booked and I would have felt terrible if she cancelled them! I feel that cancer has taken enough from me, I don't want it to start robbing my family too! We arranged for my mum to stay when she was away at \"chemo time\" so that she could relax on holiday and she messaged me every day. I felt so much better seeing the pictures she sent me and knowing she was getting a break. You say your daughter will have other family around her so she will be looked after and you will be able to be there the next time. It is hard when you want to help and are not allowed - I am a very stubborn and self sufficient person and it has taken time (diagnosed in February) for me to let anyone help let alone for me to ask for help!! I go to my hospital appointments by myself - my daughter comes near the end of chemo with a nice coffee for me! Your daughter may soften in time but as long as she knows you are there and knows she can ask for help, then you are being the support she needs!

That's how I got mine - they were very helpful and printed off some other things for me. The pathology report won't tell you how long your tumour was there, though, and you might need some help deciphering it. As Optimistic has said, for now you might need all your energy focused on getting through treatment well. Although your lymph nodes were positive, that may mean they were doing their job well and caught the cancer - that's what they are designed to do. Chemo is very good at killing any single cells that may be floating around. I hope your chemo goes well. Have you checked out the chemo club thread - scroll back to the first page where you will find a link to some good general advice and then everyone going through chemo posts issues, questions, general support etc. If you still want answers about the rate of growth of your tumour, you could ask the experts in  Ask About Breast Cancer - I'm not sure how much they'll be able to tell you, though.

Everyone's cancer experience is different so one of the most important things for you to think about is if you are satisfied with the answers you have been given. It can be difficult, sometimes to be an assertive patient when we are worried but I do feel that doctors gauge how much to tell us by our reactions so it may be that the people you dealt with felt that they had given you the amount of information you wanted at the time. Now, however, you have been thinking about things and have more questions so it seems reasonable that you should want those questions answered. The best people to do that are your GP (who should have a report of your scans) or the breast clinic. I don't think anyone would advise you to leave things as the only way to get rid of your worry is to get answers to your questions - the medical professionals involved won't mind. R",

It came up around 4 months after my mastectomy (no recon) Initially, my consultant was away so I saw a different consultant who drained it, but it came right back - I saw my consultant 2 weeks later - he doesn't favour draining and told me to try to compress it for 4 weeks. I was wearing sports bras 24/7 which was really uncomfortable but it did seem to be working slowly. Unfortunately I then got an infection in the fluid - this is very unusual, please don't worry. I was told by everyone how very unlucky I was. Anyway, because of the infection which was proving difficult to get rid of, they were draining it twice a week. Now, the infection is gone, the fluid is almost gone, but that area is very lumpy from the fibrous tissue that forms as it heals, really tender and painful most of the time. It has also pushed tissue to under my arm making a small dog ear problem into a much bigger problem. I wish I had been able to compress it or just leave it. I don't know if it will change and settle over time - I hope so. (It has only been a week since the infection was cleared, 2 since the last draining) I did at one point ask my consultant if it was OK to exercise and he said yes as long as it wasn't anything like karate that would put too much strain on the tissues and blood vessels. That is his example, I think he meant that the force of hitting something would be a problem. All my treatment is finished so I will only see someone about it if and when I approach them. If you are still undergoing treatment then maybe you could ask to see someone who can discuss all this with you? For me, my consultant who was my surgeon has always been the person who has answered these things - if I approach the nurses they just refer me to him. Hope it gets sorted for you R",

They work in a slightly different way to Tamoxifen, though the end result is the same - they stop your cells from taking up oestrogen. My oncologist explained it beautifully to me but, of course it just vanished when I left the room. They are used post-menopause instead of Tamoxifen and studies have shown improved survival stats for switching. They can cause bone thinning so you should be given a bone density scan before you start and then have them at intervals to check whether you need supplements to prevent that. I can't tell you any more than that as I am still on Tamoxifen, but I'm sure someone else will be along shortly to fill in the gaps! R",

If you had breast cancer 3 years ago, does that mean you are about 2 years out of treatment? It's not that long for such a traumatic thing and you might need some more time to deal with it emotionally. I am not speaking from experience as I haven't finished treatment yet, but I agree with the others that therapy might be the way to go for now. I suspect that knowing (as you do now if you didn't before) that removing the breast does not completely remove the risk of cancer, you would not feel differently. It sounds like you've had a really difficult few years and need some more support. Did you have any therapy when you had your breakdown? Are you able to get back in touch with them? If not, what about your BCN from before? Could you get in touch and explain your feelings about bilateral mastectomy and ask to be referred? I have a feeling your surgeon would want that before agreeing anyway. Nobody should have to live with the level of fear you describe but I really think that it is the fear that you need to get rid of. Hoping you manage to find a way through this - you can always keep coming here. R",

I'm fairly sure your GP would sign you off if that's feasible with your sick pay situation.  As far as your hair goes - I don't know where you are, but could you find a training school or salon where you could get a cut and colour at a reduced price? The FE colleges won't be taking clients but private academies might be and large salons often have training nights. You can take a bit of a risk as it's not for long. I teach hairdressing and my colleagues gave me my pre-chemo cut and colour - I told them to just do whatever they wanted. I would have let the students do it but my colleagues wanted to do it for me.  The other option is to start wearing the wig now - I didn't get a wig so can't recommend a company, but you could invest in a personalised cut for the wig - some hairdressers specialise in cutting wigs and some wig suppliers will do it for you. Of course, none of this will help for Monday - you can get some root touch up colours that will cover your roots (lots of wash out ones - look in a large chemist) You may have to put your brave face on. And none of this is trivial - cancer and treatment takes so much from us that our identity becomes much more important.  Good luck for Monday and I hope your treatment starts soon! R",

As for the core biopsy - I had it done twice and neither time was it remotely comparable to childbirth. You are given a local anaesthetic which is the worst bit really - a 'scratch' like any other injection or blood test, then a biopsy needle is guided in using the ultrasound image. The noise can be a bit of a shock - it sounds like a staple gun but I didn't feel a thing. There can be a bit of pain later after the local anaesthetic wears off but it's usually sorted with some paracetamol. I had a bit of pain the first time but not the second. I am very squeamish and absolutely rubbish with pain - I screamed having some stitches taken out once - so  I really don't think it is as bad as you are imagining!

      "Content": "Hi Beth567 A very warm welcome to the group. I'm not in exactly the same situation as you but I thought I'd reply as I might be able to reassure you while we wait for some others. There are a few of us here who have had mastectomies with or without delayed recon, but as Atty said it is a really busy group so sometimes posts can get a little lost. If we keep replying to you - we will keep bumping you to the top of the list and then your post will hopefully be seen by more people. I am a 34F - I'm not trying to compare breast sizes, just to give you an idea of the size of my breasts in relation to the rest of me. I had a single mastectomy in 2016 but the difference is I didn't want reconstruction and I am not BRCA positive. There were, and are, all sorts of reasons why I didn't want recon but some of it was to do with the size of my breasts and the impact that had on the choices I was offered. I ruled out an implant because the plastic surgeon told me that in my size the only option was a round one and it would have been hugely different to my other breast so I then would have needed another surgery on my other breast to match it up and I just couldn't face the thought of 2 surgeries and ending up with a pair of breasts nothing like mine.  I considered the DIEP but eventually decided against it - I had just been through 6 months of chemo and wanted the option with the quickest recovery. Anyway - that's all just some background, now I'll tell you how I have felt. In all honesty - I struggled at the beginning. I didn't want to look at my flat side at the same time as my remaining breast, I hated having to find the right solution to fill my bras - there were a whole load of clothes I couldn't wear - even though it was my choice, I was quite upset. Everyone on here was great and really helped me to come to terms with it and, in hindsight, it didn't take that long. I am quite fond of my scar now - and I sometimes have to have a sly check when I am out that I remembered to put something in there because I give it so little thought these days. What options have they offered you for the time before your reconstruction? Will they give you 2 silicone prostheses? Have you been shown them? They probably give the best shape and look most like a real breast - they also have a bit of weight to them so would maybe feel a bit better to you. Otherwise there are softies which they may give you for after surgery - just a beige triangle filled with stuffing. That was one of the worst bits for me - just the thought of this very medical looking thing that I had to keep washing and drying. Someone on here thankfully told me about knitted knockers - a charity which provides hand knitted breasts to BC patients - and gave me a pattern to knit one myself. Compared to the hospital softie, they are a thing of beauty and a much better shape. That is what I wear on a daily basis. One really important thing, I think is to find a bra you like. My chest is very flat so I need a much fuller cup than I would have worn before otherwise there is a gap on one side of my cleavage. You might find you are more comfortable with a different style bra until you have your reconstruction - it can make a big difference to your confidence, I think to feel that your breasts look right and that is down to the shape and style of the prosthesis and the bra. there are a few places that do mastectomy bra fittings. I went to John Lewis but some Debenhams stores do them, Marks and Spencer and possibly Bravissimo. My prosthesis fitter recommended them to me because of my struggle finding a mastectomy bra in my size and people on here have said that they will sew pockets into any bra. Sorry - I've gone on a bit and especially about bras, but getting the right one makes all the difference to how I feel. Let me know if you have any more questions.  R",

      "Content": "Hi Crafty cat Sorry to see you haven't had a lot of replies - giving you another bump up the list. We have definitely had people on the site who have had double mastectomies - I'm not sure if any of them are TN. It was something I discussed with my team when I was diagnosed in 2016, but eventually decided against it. If you're not BRCA positive, it often isn't offered to you outright but it's definitely something you should discuss with your surgeon. See what they say when you ask them - I always think it's good to have all the options on the table - for me, just knowing I could opt for that made it a little easier to deal with. I probably just wanted a bit of control over the whole situation, to be honest but that is a reasonable response to what we go through, I think. I wasn't able to have a lumpectomy as I had 3 tumours in the one breast so I was told it had to be mastectomy. It is true that statistically lumpectomies achieve the same outcome, but do remember medical people take comfort in numbers and facts whereas we wake in the middle of the night with a bunch of what ifs! Ultimately, this is your treatment and if you have an understanding surgeon then they should allow you to come to the decision that is right for you, regardless of the statistics. We are individuals and we all react differently and are satisfied with different outcomes. In the end I had a single mastectomy without reconstruction and I'm really content with that, but other people would be really unhappy with it. Was there anything in particular you wanted to know? Perhaps we can rustle up someone to help. Sorry to hear your anxiety is bad but I think you can forgive yourself - it's natural given what you are going through. If you haven't already, you can always see your GP if it's really bad - they are often very understanding about the issues around cancer. Lots of people here will tell you the anxiety fades with time - and it does. It's really difficult to believe while you are still going through it all, but there will be a day when you realise you are not as worried. We grow up trusting our bodies and a cancer diagnosis takes that away from us, and it takes time to build that trust back up. For now, one step at a time - right foot, left foot and repeat. We are all here for you whenever you need. Hopefully we'll get someone along who can help a bit more than me. R",

      "Content": "Hi I had multi - focal tumours - it changed my treatment plan which then meant that my outcome was more or less the same. It's difficult at the beginning to think positively, but breast cancer teams very often don't mention prognosis because they are assuming success. I would say, wait till you have the results and then research some more. As has been said - there are different types of breast cancer and until you both know the full picture, you could be torturing yourself. It is hard when this is happening to someone close to you - you can feel so helpless and you so desperately want to help. As you can see, we often have partners join us and that is a wonderful and supportive thing - clearly, you are going to be a great support. R",

I was a nervous wreck before surgery - but for no reason - I think it amused my surgeon no end. I was literally shaking from head to toe as they took me in.  Other people's reactions are such a difficult thing - I think cancer definitely weeds out your fair-weather friends. Hopefully you've had others who have been better than you hoped - balances it out. I'm sure some others will be along soon with some experience of the LICAP We'll all think of you tomorrow R",

      "Content": "Hi It is standard practice to test the lymph nodes. If they look clear on ultrasound then they will often do a biopsy later on once they have the results and know what they are dealing with - no point testing nodes randomly before they have diagnosed a lump. The way the lymph system works is that the nodes are a line of defence which are designed to stop things invading your body. That's why they get swollen when you are ill. Sometimes they will find cancer cells in the nodes but they have been trapped there and haven't travelled to the rest of the body. By the end of treatment I had had 16 lymph nodes tested and 3 of those had cancer cells in them. My treatment was designed to remove my tumour and treat my lymph nodes for any rogue cancer cells (radiotherapy) and treat my entire body for rogue cancer cells (chemotherapy). A year later, and I am considered to be currently free of cancer - there has been no evidence of spread. Each patient is different and the teams that treat them devise a plan to give the best outcome, and breast cancer has very very high success rates. It's natural that you will panic but try not to exhaust yourself with all the possibilities. I know some people feel reassured by investigating everything and being prepared for the worst. When your girlfriend gets her results, she will most likely see a consultant who will explain what everything means. If it turns out to be something other than cancer, there will probably still be a lot of information to take in. You could both start a list of questions that you want to ask so that you don't forget anything. It can also be useful to make notes or ask if you can record the conversation on your phone (I am presuming you will also go to the results appointment) The medical professionals do this day after day and they understand how we all feel and guide you through the process well. It is frightening but people will support you every step of the way. We are all here for you both as much as you need. R",

      "Content": "Hi Pointer - are you on hormone therapy? After surgery I had inflamed tendons in my wrist after surgery and we just couldn't get it to go away. My breast clinic physio told me that they are beginning to think there is a link between the hormone therapy and tendon issues. It certainly seems to come up now and again on here. Have you seen a breast cancer specialist physio? I'm thinking yes if you have been treated for cording. Any breaking of the skin can be a risk for lymphoedema but it's largely the infection risk that is a problem. It might be a good idea to discuss the lymphoedema with them. My tendon problem eventually stopped when I developed lymphoedema and was fitted for a sleeve. The physio thought it had probably been the lymphoedema causing the problem in the first place. I'm not remotely suggesting you have lymphoedema - I have rubbish veins and have always been a fluid type of person - I also had a seroma after surgery which was drained many times and my lymphoedema specialist blamed that - I think it was probably inevitable for me. But the risk is worrying you so  it might be worth having a discussion and checking for signs. You could also post in Ask about lymphoedema  where a specialist will get back to you in 2 working days. Beachwalker19 - they need to give you a line! Ask them to give you a PICC line or Hickman line or a port - you shouldn't have to go through that to have chemo. Have you had a vascular scan to see why they are having trouble? I have to admit, they struggle to get bloods from me these days - they tend to have to go into my hand. I got a Hickman line half-way through chemo - I don't know why they don't just fit a line at the beginning - it made everything so much easier. Fingers crossed you both get these things sorted out R",

Your friend and your hairdresser both sound amazing and just what you needed!  It isn't vanity, it's your identity - it's important to be happy with yourself! I went with scarves instead of a wig and one day my new BCN apologised for not recognising me - I told her it was because I had a chemo face and just looked like everyone else. She didn't like that, but it's true - I don't blame her for not recognising me!

      "Content": "Hi Beth567 I can understand you dreading waiting for reconstruction but I definitely think that, as you say, it will be better in the long term. They usually advise you wear a bra straight after surgery - something soft, no underwire and front fastening is easier. You can get them from the specialist online shops like Amoena and Nicola Jane. You will probably be told to wear it overnight as well so best to get a couple so you can wash them. They normally give you a softie or two to leave with and advise you don't wear anything else for a while (I think it was 6 weeks but I can't remember) The pain isn't massive for a mastectomy - I took paracetamol for 2 days. You will be given exercises to do to maintain the movement in your arm and shoulder and you start them the day after surgery usually. Let's think - I was probably back in a normal bra about 4 weeks after surgery - I've given up on underwires though because they irritate my node clearance scar - your scar might be shorter. I think I would have waited longer to wear an underwire. As for the prosthesis - you have to have a fitting to get the right one so hopefully that will be sorted out for you after the surgery - I actually waited nearly a year for mine because I was a bit reluctant to get one (I don't know why), so I don't really know how soon you can wear one - pretty soon though I'd think. There is a website called breastfree where you can see photos of real women with mastectomies with and without clothes. I wasn't sure whether to tell you about it as it is a little bit pro-flat, but if you don't mind ignoring their anti-recon stance - the pictures are really good and I found it helpful to see what it was going to look like. Of course this is a really difficult decision for you to make - if there's anything else I can help with - let me know! R",

      "Content": "Hi Jackproc Welcome to the online community. It must be quite a shock for your girlfriend and you to be dealing with this news and waiting for results is just awful.  Since you mention histology, I presume your girlfriend had a biopsy? In which case she most likely had an ultrasound. Mammograms show up areas of concern, ultrasounds give a better idea of what sort of tissue has shown up in the mammogram and then the biopsy identifies exactly what the cells are.  There are some things to think about to help reassure you IF it turns out to be cancer: - breast cancer is very treatable and has successful outcomes for about 90% of people - there are many of us here who have been through treatment and are now getting on with our lives. results give ideas about the aggressiveness of a tumour but that refers to how fast it is growing, not whether it has spread Malignant doesn't necessarily mean it has spread - it has the potential to but may not have had the opportunity or the time to. If it is found to be a form of breast cancer, then your girlfriend will be given further tests and biopsies to see if it has spread and to find the best method of treating it. It is a very worrying time for you both and a shock particularly as she is so young. There is a link to some information on breast cancer here and specifically about tests and diagnosis here. Some people like to research and know as much as possible before their results, others prefer to not know and hear everything from the medical team. Sometimes a bit of both works. One thing we normally would advise is to stay away from Dr Google - that can lead to some very terrifying and untrue information.  If you do want to research - I am thinking that maybe you do as you have reached out to us - then stick to the reputable sites - Macmillan, obviously, Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Care, Breast Cancer Now  Try to distract yourself, and your girlfriend until the results appointment. It isn't easy, but it can be so overwhelming and it can help to have lots of things to do so that you don't get consumed by \"what ifs\" We will all be thinking of you both - please let us know how she gets on R",

Your scalp can be a bit more sensitive during chemo so something gentle is best, but you might find your normal shampoo works. You don't need conditioner but can use a general moisturiser. One of the side effects of some chemo is dry skin so this includes your scalp. Macmillan have a useful booklet on hair loss - there is a link here Hope it settles down for you soon! R",

It was actually a major thing for me to consider how I'd feel doing physical things. Did you have rads? I did get to see a physio - my BCN referred me because I couldn't get in to the rads position and she saw me before and after. She is of the opinion that it gets played down too much and said it's the reason she sees most people. She reckoned at least a year to stretch the muscles and I can feel them softening now. My pecs do voluntarily contract that side sometimes which is weird - don't know if it's because they don't have any insulation on them and it's a shiver type thing or maybe nerves misbehaving. Definitely chase up the physio or see if there's a cancer rehab session at your hospital - or both!

At my meeting when he was telling me they had decided I'd have radiotherapy he said that I was young (I love it when he says that) so my body could handle them throwing everything at me because I am supposed to have 52 years of life left and they want to give me as much of that as they can (I'm 48) It made me laugh so much - I mean, if you're aiming high, why stop at 100?

I'm sorry to hear your mum has to go through this - it must be a difficult time for you all - especially as she is your dad's carer. Everyone is different, but most people aren't that incapacitated by mastectomy. It will be harder for your mum as she is having a double mastectomy, but she should be up and about - maybe quite tired, and as you say - no lifting for a while. She will likely be given exercises to start the day after surgery to keep her arms and shoulders mobile and stretch out the muscles and tissue.  My mastectomy was a couple of years ago and I was 48, but I only needed help for 3 or 4 days. More than anything, I should think your mum will appreciate your company and support. It's a tough diagnosis. She is lucky to have caring children who are thoughtful enough to come here - remember you are doing well and be sure to look after yourself too. Sending hugs to you and your family! R",

      "Content": "Hi all I know this is a walking thread and I hi-jack it sometimes with a running post, but I figure running is like a sister to walking. Well tonight I am going to be even worse - maybe a distant cousin of walking. I really couldn't face a cold, dark run after work so I did the circuit training they taught me at the hospital \"cancer gym\" Fair enough, they used to make me do an hour and tonight I did 30 minutes but better than nothing! Tomorrow I have an early doors appointment at the lymphoedema clinic so at least I can say I exercised today - hoping for a gold star obviously! Not sure how I feel about it - on the one hand, I've been waiting for it since October, but on the other - I will know for sure whether it is or isn't so there's a 50/50 chance that my last glimmer of hope will be dashed! I know it will be fine whatever and I am grateful for the opportunity to be here to have lymphoedema but.... you know! BTW it's a hula hoop in the photo - had so much fun doing it at the gym sessions that I bought my own and completely recommend it - good for your core and suprisingly good cardio- plus you can't really hula without smiling. Lindylou49 just a little add on to the advice from Leolady56 - if you ever want to be able to find something that isn't a long-running thread, then underneath the 'email notifications' box is the 'discussion tools' box with the option to \"save this discussion in my favourites\" If you click on that then the link will be saved to your profile - from your profile you just click on Favourites from the left hand menu and it's all there. It's good if there is useful information in a thread that you want to come back to later - especially as our group is so busy - it can take ages to search for something!

I can't imagine how hard this must be for you - life can be so cruel and unfair sometimes.  I understand you wanting to post here for the time being - familiarity can be a good comfort at difficult times. I haven't been on here for a while either - I am not going through anything as difficult as you, but lost a young relative to breast cancer recently and have been experiencing a lot of survivors guilt. I have also had reason to question what I survived for, but I know this is fuelled by my sadness and I am able to think about it a little less as each day passes. Don't forget, although your partner is the person closest to your heart, there are other people who love you and don't want to lose you. Perhaps in a day or two you could have another think about stopping Tamoxifen - maybe you could postpone your decision - if in a month or two you still feel it is what you want, you will still be able to stop it then. You don't have to be strong all the time - we are all here to hold you up when you need it. I know planning your wedding will be a hard thing to do under the circumstances but I hope you can both find some joy in the event and have a happy day! I know you are not here for the walking, but I have often found that this thread encourages me to see the wonder and beauty in the world when I am walking - even if it's a hurried rush to work - sometimes I think \"what could I post on the walking thread?\" and before I know it, I have stepped away from my sad thoughts for a minute or two and it helps enormously. We are all here for you, whenever you need - maybe have a little read of the Carer's group when you are ready and join in there if you like the look of it, or stay here with us - you know we will all help however we can.

After my op, I think I was starting to run after a couple of months, but the op and rads hit me hard and I took a really long time to recover physically. I had mastectomy without recon, though so didn't have to think about the strain on a boob. I went right back to the beginning at first - I use a training plan with 1 minute walk 1 minute run to start then build up from there - similar to the couch to 5k one but building up the distance at the same time. I've run for many years and it's hard emotionally to be back at the beginning but I have set a goal with the physio for 20-30 minutes running regularly by July so if I can reach that then I'll be delighted. Yes, give it a week or two and try again - the walking helps to keep all the muscles ticking over so you should be able to pick it up again fairly quickly. R",

I do miss you all when I'm not around.  I have been working very long hours these last 6 weeks - 4 different contracts at 3 different companies - have managed to wear myself out and am taking a few hours today to try to fight off a horrible cold I've been struggling with.  There has been very little exercise of any sort, for me lately. This is bothering me, but one \"cancer promise\" was to not let work take over my life again (previous employers sent my P45 rather swiftly once diagnosed, so I know my worth - lol) so I searched out some swimming lessons near me and will start as soon as my cold has gone. I can swim but don't swim as my technique is a bit rubbish so I thought lessons would be good - and will also give me an incentive to go after work!!! I'm not sure I will ever brave an outdoor swim in this country, but you never know. The Health and Leisure centre is very near me but I have never been there so I went for a look around before booking - it's all quite clean and well kept and importantly for me, separate changing cubicles. Where I used to swim, there is only one big, open changing room which I am not really brave enough for just now. Perhaps one day I will attempt to explain to them why that matters to some people. Anyway, at the \"new\" place, there is a nice, landscaped area out the front with some seats so hopefully it will soon be warm enough to contemplate sitting there and catching up with this thread before my swim! I'm loving the photos of everything springing to life - I will hopefully head to Dorset for a few coastal walks at the end of next week so I'm excited by what potentially is springing up there! Hope everyone is well and getting stronger day by day!! R",

      "Content": "Hi all Just back from my run - I am going to bore you all with stats now! :) So I have decided to switch my focus from minutes to distance. With the hospital rehab team I have set a goal for 30 minutes running at a time by August and that seems fairly do-able from here (fingers crossed I can keep the fatigue and anything other setbacks at bay) So today I managed 3km in 25 minutes - hopefully I'll work on getting that down to 20 minutes then work up to 5k. Still no developments at the swans nest - those cygnets may be the most eagerly awaited ones ever - there is always a crowd!  Don't seem to be able to post images just now - so please imagine a Canada Goose with her goslings on the grass! Hope you all have the sun shining on you today! R",

Really I am here to give a thank you. Violetsniff a while back I posted about my park and the garden there that is tended by volunteers. You said you wondered if they knew how thankful I was for it. (I'm sure it was you - apologies if I am confused) Anyway - that made me think about my gratitude and how it really should be shared, so I found the website for the \"friends\" of the park and emailed them, explaining how much they had helped me get through treatment and recovery. I received a lovely email back - they were so delighted and asked for permission to share it in their newsletter, which of course I gave.  So now I am thanking you - your comment generated something that has given a group of people some positive thanks and feedback for the work they do for the local community. That is the kind of positivity that I can pull out of the cancer experience and I should do it more! Hope everyone is walking with a spring in their step! R",

The lymphoedema team is only 2 people strong but they have been great - the truth is, there isn't a good solution for work - I teach hairdressing and beauty therapy courses so wearing a glove is a bit of a hindrance. They have recommended some places to check out different compression sleeve options or I wear a vinyl glove on top every day, or I take my chances. I've agreed to give it another 3 months and see if I can find a solution. They were quite shocked at the state of the sleeve and glove after just 6 weeks :)  R",

Then decided to walk part way home and got lost in the lanes and alleyways in The City. I always get lost, but I found the right way once, so I can do it again (or maps, I know - but more adventurous to find my own way!) Anyway, getting lost meant more walking so can be considered a good thing!! I saw a great bit of art (I think) this morning but I would have to stop in the middle of the road to get the photo. There is a pedestrian bit there but it was all too busy, really. I will try to get it next week if it's still there! Hope you've all had a good day! R",

Definitely not London bridge - it is very grey and unattractive as far as bridges go - but loveable for other things I'd say somewhere west - maybe Wandsworth or Battersea - so in a coach would pass it on the way to or from the west and south - Wales, Bristol, Dorset etc. Well, I must find myself a more exotic running/walking route to keep up! zero exercise today sat at a computer all day - might get out that hula hoop!

Well done for managing it all. I haven't caught up with everything else yet but hope everyone is well - I will catch up on it all soon.  I have been fighting some stupid demons - sometimes I long for the days when I was naive enough to think I would just jump back into my life and never give cancer another thought. Anyway - I am winning now so it's all good. A positive is that I have been throwing myself into exercise and dragon boat training to distract myself so my fitness has improved a lot. The cygnets were born - 7 of 8 hatched. There are 6 left so doing better than last year. We also have 4 goslings and some baby coots (I don't know what they are called!)  I am walking a lot and I never go for a walk without thinking of this thread and I tell you all about it in my head and have taken lots of pictures for you all but somehow never posted them. I'm still not getting notifications for this thread though I do for others. It's funny, isn't it - you can all be a support for me even though I don't post - just knowing you are all here helps a lot! Right - now I am off for my swimming lesson.

Here is a pic of the end of my run - once I had finished, I had to climb up this cliff to the retreat - lol! Went slowly And the view from the top... Hope it's been a good day for everyone! R",

Thanks to tendon problems and PN, managed to drop a pan of boiling water last night and burnt my thigh. There was much swearing at cancer and a few tears if I'm honest. So - forced myself out for a little run (6 minutes x3) today and I feel much brighter now and ready for another, hopefully gentler, week. While Mirabo gets settled in - here is a London pond. There are 3 in a line in my park formed from a river that has gone underground. Years after I moved here, I found out it was where my Grandad grew up - he knew it as a proper river and used to fish there so I like to run around them and remember him . Hope everyone is enjoying the weekend R",

Hope you have a lovely holiday!! - you could always take a she-wee - lol - does what it says! I've been so busy doing one job and looking for another that my exercise has fallen off these last couple of weeks - and here I am sat on the sofa when I should be out running!!  I did do some retail exercise today which involved buying clothes to exercise in - does that count? Now I'm going to have a little rant -  I just about held back a meltdown in yet another bra shop -the assistant did say she understood and would feedback to head office that we might like a- choice b - something vaguely attractive then found a lovely bra in John Lewis but not a post surgery bra so I am going to try to sew something in it to hold my prosthesis. Sometimes, constant barriers lead to alternative solutions - if you can't go through it, go round it!

      "Content": "Hi all I don't have a garden - just a tiny balcony on which I try to grow various things very unsuccessfully! I thought I'd share a different perspective on the slug/pests problem. My daughter has always been a gentle soul - when she inevitably had head lice as a child, I used to comb them from her hair while she sat there in tears because I was killing them, and then we had to bury them and say a few words!!!! Anyway, being a couple of floors up, I don't get slugs and snails, but I once had a lovely display of geraniums which caterpillars turned to twigs in a day - I was furious and my daughter caught me flinging them all on to the ground below. After she called me a murderer, I tried to explain to her why I was doing it. Afterwards, her reply was - \"but it's their food, you only want them to look at - why can't you share them?\" It floored me and I didn't have a reply. Her simplistic solution was to just plant more of them, then we could all have some.  I know it doesn't work that way, but it did make me look at them less as \"pests\" and more as things I can try to co-exist with. My solution was to never grow geraniums again - not sure that's helping the caterpillars much :) I've been nursing a nasty cold these last few days so no exercise - I'm off to the park again in a bit to try a little walk. The 6 cygnets are now only 3 :(   Hoping some of them make it to adulthood!!! Have a good day everyone! R",

I was told no swimming and no gym during chemo due to infection risk, but my team were more than happy for me to keep running. I should think the mud runs etc would be a no-no, though. I got too tired towards the end of the 6 months and also had a line in my chest which I figured got too sweaty (after a trip to the hospital with an infection that possibly came from the entry site of the line) I carried on walking as much as I could and did some resistance exercises at home. Check with your team, but they are usually OK for you to do as much as you can manage - it just needs to be germ-free. Wishing you well through chemo R",

Feel like the fatigue is finally back under control - of sorts - but worried that every time I get a cold I will feel like this - ah well! All the pictures are inspiring me and I do love the springtime so I will get out my trainers and do some sort of exercise this weekend.  DohaYogi - welcome, though of course we wish you had no reason to be here. You can call this home for as long as you like - I've been around for a couple of years now - I liked it too much to leave when my treatment finished. Hopefully we can help you make this year improve. Looking forward to reading your yoga posts - all forms of exercise get a good response here!  Violetsniff - what a fantastic carousel horse - your high street is a lot more interesting than mine! Now, I have recently seen a sign to a \"hidden\" nature reserve near my work but never had time/daylight to go in there either on the way there or back.

Very low tolerance now for the sort of petty nonsense I encountered at work today. So glad I went -  I managed 15 minutes at a faster pace - but it was dusk and very quiet as all the birds were settling for the night - so I got to see this - bit blurry as I wanted to film it, but looks like 6 or 7 eggs!!

My walking holiday was good for me physically and emotionally and I had a lovely time with a great group of people. However, I've been sleeping a huge amount since I got back so I think I didn't realise how tired it made me. I'm hoping it's not the fatigue back again - think I'm just tired, but finding it hard to be motivated to get out again as I keep getting up so late. Back to work on Monday so I'll know for sure then - lol! So what will 2019 hold? I hope it's full of great things for everyone. I am thinking of signing up to go with my dragon boat team to Venice in June for a long paddle through the canals, and some other \"active\" holidays - so I am relying on you all for the motivation to reach the fitness levels I need!  All the walking you've all been doing looks and sounds amazing - it inspires me to visit more parts of the country and plan more walking!

Cancer is to blame for the funeral and I suspect perhaps the wedding, too. My treatment convinced my daughter that life is short and she is now living quite recklessly.

      "Content": "Hi all Well, I don't seem to be getting notifications for this thread - I thought it was quiet.  Great photos and great walking. I did my first \"urban hike\" yesterday. I'm optimistically saying first! We did 12 miles along the Regents canal - with a detour up Primrose Hill, a stop for lunch and another for a coffee. Then a pub at the end! I was very tired even though it was quite a slow pace. Dragon boating today - I'm exhausted now and would quite like a nap but I know that's not good for me in the long run so I'm trying to keep busy!!  No good photos but here's one of the view from Primrose hill - I love telecom tower, no idea why. Hope you've all had a good weekend! R",

They are not in bloom yet, though - I'm a bit jealous! Well, I'm very happy - I managed a run today for the first time since January. I'm back down to 3K and had to stop for a breather a couple of times but I did it. Couldn't choose what pic to post so here is the heron and the swan's nest - 6 eggs. Sorry it looks like she's got no head - it's curved round, tending to her eggs!  Have a good day, everyone! R",

I know the tech team are doing what they can to sort it out as soon as possible - hopefully not too long - I feel we have been struggling with issues a good while now. On my pc, I had to clear the cache to be able to access the site at all - I don't know if that's relevant to an ipad but if you have any option to clear your browsing history, that might work - and try to go in fresh rather than saved links - my saved links are all rubbish - even the ones the computer throws up for me, and the ones google takes me to. I'm not struggling too much with photos but they are taking an age to upload. You can use the form in my signature to log a complaint, or use the \"contact us\" link at the bottom of the page - or maybe for now -  feed back to the community team via the link on your homepage - (little notification on the left of the screen on pc) I'm not encouraging you to complain, as such, but the more info they have about what people are experiencing, the more likely they are to find the problem and a solution for everyone. Fingers crossed! (I tried to put in an emoji for that and it went in every line! Oops) R",

We timed our walk back and realised she walks at half my normal pace, so I am only doing half the distance, but nice taking time to see things.  Pic is of some new trees that have bright red branches - they looked like they'd been spray- painted!!

Walk/Commute through the park these last 2 days for me - had planned a run Thursday morning but the swimming quite wore me out so I didn't go - naughty! It seems the Egyptian geese didn't stay which I am a little disappointed about, but the swans are happy and peaceful on the nest! It's been such beautiful weather today though warm enough for skinny dipping? not sure seaspirit44 - also wondering how you checked if they were naked  I am still not getting notifications for this thread - even though I get them for every other thread! frustrating. Also the like button has disappeared from my phone again. yellowroses- have you contacted admin about your notifications? you can email them at community@macmillan.org.uk or there is a link under my signature which will take you to a form to report technical issues. hope everyone is looking forward to a good weekend!

I'd love a retro one with flowers all over it and pretend I'm Esther Williams in a Buzby Berkely musical!! but too timid so bought a plain black one - lol Anyway - the reason for telling you that is that the photo is of the dock outside the shop!

      "Content": "Hi Peggysgirl Welcome! Hopefully you are feeling better now the day is up and running. You've had great advice already - I just wanted to tell you I was a little terrified of joining this site - it's quite far out of my comfort zone and my daughter was absolutely shocked when I told her. It's now 5 months since I finished my treatment and I'm still hanging around now and again. It has been a huge support for me and probably the most helpful thing I've come across during treatment. It really is a community and we will be here whenever you need us! I had node involvement after being repeatedly assured they were fine - I don't know why they do that - I guess they can't really tell for sure till they get them in the lab. I had all my nodes removed (and chemo and rads) and now I feel that it's gone and I'm in the same position as anyone else finishing treatment. It can be hard to stay positive and lots of us will identify with the feeling that it keeps getting worse, but you will get to a point where you have all the information and you make your way through treatment one day at a time. None of us will tell you this is easy, but it is very do-able and treatment is very effective. Being positive is the big picture - you are allowed to cry, to be angry but then step back and look at the positive. Good luck with the scan on Friday - let us know how it goes! R",

      "Content": "Hi Flopsyuk Sorry to hear you are still struggling. I'm presuming the options you mention are a result of the meeting at the Macmillan centre? I can't give you any advice as I don't have a comparison with a positive outcome. I once complained to my BCN that the consultant oncologist had said in her letter to my GP that I was having reconstruction when I hadn't even been asked to make that decision - I never saw her again, though that is probably a coincidence as I saw several different oncologists during chemo. I also \"had a word\" with my new BCN when she upset me - I've never seen her since either! :)  Have you had a good relationship with your oncologist up till now? Who do you feel most comfortable talking to? I know you don't feel up to taking a lot on but is it feasible to start with the easiest option then escalate if that doesn't bring results? Hopefully someone will be along in a bit with more constructive advice.  Hoping you find a solution R",

      "Content": "Hi Optimistic It's brave of you to post your feelings like that - does it feel good to have written them down? As you are probably realising - they are very normal feelings.  Before I say anything else - you were told you had cancer 4 weeks ago and you had surgery 3 days ago! You need to be kind to yourself and I would say that you should try to explain to your family that you need some time alone sometimes. There is a very big difference between being sad and being depressed. Your family are probably worried about you and want to help you. If you were depressed, no amount of jollying you along would help and is often detrimental as it makes people feel that they are failing because they can't \"snap out of it\". Given what you are going through, it is more likely that you are sad - but if you feel consistently low and it doesn't improve over the next couple of weeks, please seek some help. So - if you were to explain to your family that you are still an optimist, but you are feeling sad and need some time alone to process your thoughts, do you think they would be happier to give you some space? It shouldn't be all the time, but it isn't wrong! It also isn't wrong to cry in front of them and with them - they are going through a hard time too, and it can help to share emotions - you are not ruining their happiness. You've already had good advice about reasons not to worry, so I am going to tell you this - you will be happy again!  I am the same age as you and diagnosed in February - I left my lump for a while before I went to my GP, it was 52mm, grade 2 - in my lymph nodes. I am happy now - not all the time, who is,  but I smile and laugh and appreciate life. You will get there too, but it's early days! Nobody, just nobody, can predict what will happen with any individual cancer - you can look at averages and statistics but we are all individuals and will have our own outcome. I hope you had a nice evening with your family. Take care of yourself as you recover! R",

      "Content": "Hi NN17 I see you've already had some great advice and reassurance. I just wanted to add a couple of things. Firstly, you should be able to get your report if you ask for it. I wasn't given mine and was dealt with quite coldly when I rang the BCN number. They told me to ring the patient liaison department and they were extremely kind and helpful and printed off a whole load of reports and sent them to me.  It is shocking when our diagnosis changes and can be devastating but please don't panic - it is still treatable, it just needs more treatment. Another point is that you do have a choice - I am not remotely suggesting you refuse treatment but I think  it's important to remember that you have a say in all of this and it is OK to ask why they are recommending a certain treatment and how it will benefit you. Having said that - I asked them to throw everything they had at it, but that is me and if you are not comfortable about having a treatment, then you should feel that you can have another appointment to talk about it. I'd also like to reassure you that you might find chemo very manageable. I was told not to work because I teach and the infection risk was too high - but I could have. I met up with friends, did some projects round the house, helped my daughter move and kept up my running regime for most of it. No-one can predict how you will find it but lots of us fare well with it. You have had a shock at your results appointment and it will take a little time to get used to it - I can understand how heartbroken you must feel. Take things one day at a time and you will get through this  Have you checked out the breast cancer chemo club thread? Lots of practical advice as well as support from others having treatment. This is a path we'd rather not have to walk, but we will be with you every step! R",

Most people lose some hair but it can be minimal - hopefully some people with experience of it will be along soon. For now, it seems to be recommended on here that you have paracetamol before it goes on, make sure your hair is very wet - I remember someone saying to take your own conditioner with you (and a hat for afterwards) and to make sure the cap fits really well to your head. You could always post this in our chemo club thread as that is for people currently having chemo treatment so you might grab their attention! The first page has some tips of what to take to chemo sessions etc so might be worth a look, anyway and, of course feel free to join in! Hope both the cold cap and chemo go well for you! R",

I was treated so gently by everyone the day of my op - I think they had been primed.  Getting over my loss of confidence after treatment was a combination of just pushing myself to get out every day and having support from people who encouraged me. My line manager at work kept up gentle pressure to go back and colleagues organised get togethers - it was a slow gradual process. I was the same after my daughter was born - many years ago - and it took time then, too.  Glad the clinical psychologist is helping and glad your mum seemed better.  Have you thought about phoning the Macmillan helpline to get advice about finances - they might be able to point you to some help.  0808 808 00 00 - they are open 9am - 8pm Monday to Friday.

      "Content": "I'm coming to the end of chemo and need to make a decision about my operation - I was wondering if anyone could share experiences of wearing prosthesis. I have to have a mastectomy of my left breast (due to multi focal disease) with lymph node clearance and am considering a double mastectomy with no reconstruction. There is a small element of fear of cancer in my other breast in the future, but a large part of my thinking is not having to always wear a prosthesis (I don't want a reconstruction) My breasts are an F cup and going without a bra isn't an option - I even wear a bra top to bed. I also have always been a keen exerciser - particularly running and cycling- and I can't imagine this being comfortable with a prosthesis in, not to mention that there doesn't seem to be a lot of choice of everyday or sports bras in my size. I guess I feel that with one breast, I will always need some sort of prosthetic - even in bed, whereas with no breasts, I could choose whether to wear them or not. I am seeing my surgeon in a few days - he is willing but not keen so I'd like to be clear about my feelings. Does anyone have any experiences - good or bad - to share about exercising with prosthesis - or feelings towards them in general? Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Shellian Well, I'm not going to be a lot of help because I didn't have reconstruction and have no plans to. I was absolutely terrified of both operations, though so can understand your fear. If your op is in January - that is a lot of time to be worrying. Is there anything in particular you are worried about? The actual procedure? recovery? result? Remember that your surgeon has to go over the possible risks, it doesn't mean that will happen to you. On the day of my mastectomy I made my surgeon explain in detail what would happen if there was a fire alarm while I was under anaesthetic. He kept a straight face and talked me through it. I hope I haven't given you a new worry, it's just to explain how much of a worrier I am - every little thing. I am trying to learn not to be like that - it's a waste of emotion really, because it has no effect on the outcome at all.  It sounds like generally you have a lot to cope with and after cancer treatment it can be hard to get your confidence back. Have you had or considered some counselling? You could speak to your BCN about it, particularly if you think it would help you get through the op. I have had periods of my life where I have not wanted to walk to the corner shop by myself and I can assure you that you can overcome it but you might need some help. It is possible to get that happy go lucky girl back! A big congratulations on quitting smoking - that is a massive achievement and you must be very proud of yourself. I hope your mum is doing well and you've had a good visit. Now you are one step closer to getting your confidence back! R",

      "Content": "Hi Shellian Sorry to read about your problems. I've just gone back to work after 2 years off - my financial situation did get quite bad and I had to deal with debt collection agencies etc. I still owe the water company quite a lot of money (well, they can't cut you off so they went straight to the bottom of the repayment list) I'm sure if Macmillan have advised you that you know everything I'm about to say but thought you might like to hear it from someone who went through it. Firstly you must contact everyone and tell them about your situation and agree an amount you can pay - some of mine were £1 a week - as long as you pay something, they will just check in with you now and again. You have to persevere on the phone, though to get put through to the right department - don't try not to cry - they'll redirect your call if you are that upset.  Most of the utility companies have a charity wing and can wipe your bill or reduce it if they think you are deserving enough - I got a hefty gas bill wiped completely. There is a charity which will help you organise all this and will write letters on your behalf (They are called Stepchange or something like that) That takes a bit of the worry out of it for you and they know exactly how to word things. There may be charities that can help you out financially - most industries have benevolent funds so you could look at whether there is one for whatever work you did, or what your partner does. The charity I just mentioned can have a look at that for you too.  This is not solely your problem - it is also your partner's problem. He may not be a very pro-active participant but he did go through cancer with you and it takes it's toll on everyone. He deserves help to get his family back on it's feet too and should also approach his finances with that mindset. I know it sounds cynical but I don't see the point of avoiding cynicism when we are talking about money. He is also deserving of sympathy and he must go out and get it - whether that be help with his accounts or more business to improve the situation sooner. Get a story in the local press, if that would benefit his business. Finally - it will eventually get better. It's frightening when you feel that you are drowning in the debt, but actually, once things are sorted and companies aren't harassing you - it becomes easier to deal with. It isn't pleasant and we shouldn't have to go through it but you do go THROUGH it - you come out the other side. I have a very different attitude to money now, because I can see that sometimes it's just numbers on bits of paper - people can just change those numbers or get rid of them without making a big difference to anybody else but you - so you must try to convince them to do that for you. I know how hard it is to tackle these things when you are at a low ebb and it is draining and feels like too big a hill to climb, but try to just put one foot in front of the other and you will get through. Do please persevere with getting help with it, as everyone has suggested - go back again and again if you need to until things are in place. Sending virtual hugs  R",

Therapists must have public liability insurance and they must prove to the insurance provider they've had training in the treatments they offer. It is the insurance companies that refuse to provide the cover for clients who have had cancer unless the therapists have been specifically trained in it. There are a few companies that offer specific training. So yes - the treatment is exactly the same, but the therapist who is \"trained\" is the only one insured to do it. They aren't insured for anything different but let's say they are not insured to work on someone who has had cancer, they give a massage, the client has an allergic reaction - absolutely nothing to do with cancer treatment - there is no insurance. There is actually a lot of noise about this in the beauty industry right now because companies want to offer treatments but can't get the insurance - they are trying to encourage the government to lean on the insurance companies or have the training incorporated into the standard qualifications.

I just wanted to say that it's important to accept that you will recover at your own pace - it's frustrating but I have learnt the hard way that pushing yourself too much is a bad idea and there comes a point where you have to accept it and go with the flow. Your daughter has it right. I have always been resilient, determined, independent - but it is a year since my treatment ended and I am still recovering. I finished chemo in September 16, mx October 16 and rads finished December 16 - it was probably August this year before I could handle a day without a nap. I have had good support from my hospital and GP and have been told off for doing too much or the wrong thing or going too fast.  To be honest, there are people who have never had cancer who do less, but I wanted to be back to my usual level of strength and energy. I naively thought I'd be hurtling through my life at full speed again in a matter of months but it didn't turn out that way. There's every chance your recovery will be quicker - I had all sorts of nonsense going on like a seroma and infection, tendon problems in my arm etc. The thing is, we don't get to choose how quickly we recover and if you are someone who is usually in control that can be very hard. It's normal to be frustrated and I think it's fine if we feel a bit sorry for ourselves sometimes - we have had cancer! Looking after your husband must be hard, so really you are doing rather well!

Mine took an absolute age to re-grow - it started while I was on Docetaxel but was slow. My last chemo was in September 16 and by Christmas I didn't have an inch of hair by any means. Even now, it grows much more slowly than it used to and is only just getting back to my normal hair. I have kept it quite short - not a lot of choice there and I am also just about to get the last bit of coarse \"chemo hair\" cut from the ends.  Don't be too anxious - it almost always regrows. Your body has been through a huge ordeal and actually needs everything it can muster to repair and recuperate everywhere - it will put some effort into growing hair when it has energy to spare. R",

During chemo I had massive word-finding problems and my oncology team put it down to a combination of tiredness, chemo- brain and lack of use (lol - I was off work due to infection risk). It has improved since then but I still sometimes struggle - I've learnt to be honest with people about it. Someone did tell me that it was probably a menopause/Tamoxifen issue but not sure who. My oncologist recommended crosswords and word games to help. Someone with experience of Letrozole will hopefully come along and share experiences. I know with Tamoxifen, I find different side effects with different brands so it might be worth checking if you've switched brands recently. It is always worth checking things out with your GP though - I think we tend to assume things are related to our treatment, but it could be something else - I get very short of breath when my iron count is low, for example.

Don't know if you kept it covered before but if you did it might just be that the skin needs to adjust and it will resolve in time. Lots of people use oils which should help, but I am going to recommend a brand called Moogoo.  I have had terrible scalp problems for years and years and have tried so many brands - cheap,expensive, natural, scientific etc etc. I was so sceptical when someone recommended this brand to me that I didn't try it for well over a year - but it worked for me and has continued to for 3 or 4 years now. They do lots of different products and I've seen other people recommend them on here. I just use the shampoo and conditioner but I think they do a scalp cream.

Hopefully your mum will feel better because you can tell her that it's been removed. It took time with my mum and I had to keep using the word cancer because she wouldn't or couldn't. She did say once that it helped that I spoke about it so openly - though she once insisted on asking if I wanted to be buried or cremated, so maybe too openly!! Remember your mum can contact macmillan too - just knowing it's an option might help. I would think that your mum will have thought about you and your results while she's been away so will ask you about them - she will have thought about every scenario already.

It seems like it's taking the p**** somehow. But then, I didn't cold cap so I am willing to take some of the responsibility for the baldness I had, not that it should make any difference. I have had unhappy experiences with other aspects of Macmillan in the past, but this site has made me warm to them! I honestly don't know how well I would have coped without it - if Macmillan told me either the campaign could go or the online community - I'd accept the campaign in a heartbeat! I know that's oversimplifying things and a ridiculous comparison - also selfish - but it's how I reason it to myself and I look away from those ads. Right now, I'm not fundraising or volunteering etc so I think of silent acceptance as my contribution. The truth is - I am not the target audience - I know about Macmillan, I know about cancer - I'm likely to contribute anyway - it's designed to catch the attention of people who wouldn't otherwise - so it needs to be something they are going to want to do - like the Movember thing - it's catchy! That doesn't mean I agree with it or disagree with the complaints - like I said, my feelings are really mixed. What I would like though is for Macmillan to acknowledge how hard the reality is alongside  the jolly smiling shavers - to get people to talk about this disease freely so that in the future, people don't have to feel like this. An ad that shows both those things. When I was bald, I got taunted and ridiculed by a group of children in the park - that shouldn't happen!! Trust me, I told them exactly why I had no hair and they were embarassed and apologised, but I suspect they've never heard cancer spoken about other than people in a soap opera and probably didn't expect someone with cancer to be walking round the park laughing and chatting (with my daughter) That would be the pay off for me - fine, have the campaign - everyone shave their heads if they want to but in return, we get to say cancer like any other word, like any other disease as loud and as often as we like till it loses it's power. So people can be 'brave' enough to talk about it instead of copying it. I'd prefer that to a not very meaningful apology! R",

I ended up in hospital 2 weeks after my last chemo - I think it's cumulative and each time you are that little bit more susceptible. Things will start to improve eventually. Rads is often easier than chemo. Take it easy and be kind to yourself - your body has been through a lot. R",

      "Content": "Hi Luckbealady and Haysie Firstly - I am no expert, so this is anecdotal from being around this site for a couple of years - My cancer was ER+ As far as regimes go - Lots of hospitals have dropped the F from the FECT regime. I think they consider it not necessary anymore. As for the T - that can be Docetaxel or Paclitaxel - the paclitaxel is generally easier for people to tolerate, I think. As Haysie said - this seems to be the regime that a lot of people with TNC have. As for the cold cap - I'm sure your chemo nurses will give you all the advice you need, but the Tax drugs don't usually cause your hair to fall out, so you may not need to wear it for those treatments. Hope your first treatment went well today Luckbealady R",

This thread is particularly for people to post their problems and concerns as well support one another. Don't forget, there are many people not posting because they are coping well and busy! Chemo affects us all differently - mine was in 2016 and I fared pretty well - kept busy, exercised etc. Plenty of people keep on working through chemo. I'm sorry to hear you are going through this for a second time, I expect things will have changed a bit - hopefully for the better. Knowing which drugs you are given can help you to research them as well as get support on here from others on the same drug and be prepared for the side effects. Your team won't want you to suffer in silence - they will happily help you to manage any side effects with drugs and advice. Hopefully, chemo will treat you gently again - you can definitely do this! We will be here for you, cheering you on! R",

I just thought I'd respond to say I've had different advice from different oncologists - not helpful. I'm going to see them at the end of the month and see if they can explain. I continued to have periods until half way through chemo but haven't had one for 5 months now. The original plan was Tamoxifen, the last oncologist I saw wants to switch that to anastrozole, but my understanding was that you had to have been a year without a period to be deemed post menopausal. I get so confused about these drugs, if I'm honest, but isn't it the case that they do different things depending on whether your ovaries are producing oestrogen? I think you'll get loads of replies - my feelings for my situation is that Tamoxifen is preferable as it doesn't cause the bone thinning that the others do and I have osteopenia.  Has your oncologist not given you any guidance? It's a hefty choice to make. Hope the radiotherapy goes well! R",

We don't get to choose our families and they don't always treat us as we would like, but your family love you and I am sure have your best interests at heart. I found that one of the hardest things to deal with during cancer treatment was the loss of control. After years looking after others, it is hard to let people tell us what to do and since we have to let our doctors do that, it's the last thing we want our family to do! On the flip side - my daughter told me she felt powerless because she couldn't even contribute to making the decisions and she found it difficult when I made decisions she didn't understand. She promptly rearranged my spare room and one day I found her on the phone to my broadband provider making changes to my contract! We had words! Really, though she was overstepping the mark, she was trying to have some control over a situation that frightened her and I can understand that need. You are a mum and a daughter and I think your family are trying to protect you in their own way. They can't fix you but they are trying to 'fix' the sale of your house for you. It's a stressful and emotional time for all of you. Could you have an honest talk with them and tell them that you need some control over things? Maybe a plan of exactly how and when they can help? I hope you can sort this out with them so that you can do what you enjoy but also get some help from them. R",

You should be able to get it done on the NHS - in theory - it does seem to depend on the hospital. You seem to have solid reasons for wanting it and that seems to be half the battle. I was approved for a double mastectomy without recon (just did the one in the end) but had to have a psychology assessment. I was told they would do anything within reason and for sure I imagine a smaller implant and reduction is reasonable - there are more shape/ recon options for smaller breasts anyway (or so I was told by the plastic surgeon) It's definitely worth asking  - maybe have a chat with your BCN - they will know whether your team are likely to approve it.

It is very different from tiredness and extra sleep doesn't really help. What works is gentle and increasing exercise, and figuring out what adjustments you can make to avoid it. Let's hope it doesn't hit you, but if it does, see if here is any help available for you. I referred myself to my hospital's cancer rehabilitation programme after treatment and have just been discharged. I used to run between 5 and 7k three times a week before cancer and did weights and circuit training another 3 days - I managed to keep running through a part of my treatment but the fatigue hit me after rads. I finished treatment at the end of 2016 and it has taken till about May this year to feel that my energy levels are back to normal - my fitness is much lower but I am working on it gradually. The fatigue still hits from time to time, particularly if I get a cold or something, but I have the strategy to cope with it now. The rehab team have told me I will find it comes back periodically but it should be less severe and I should recover from it faster. It's about finding the right balance between rest and activity.

I completely understand how you feel - it's just awful when we feel that life is on hold and it can seem never ending. It will end though - you will get back to work and uni and pick things up where you left off. I didn't have recon, but I think rads can have an effect on it so I am sure your team will have tried and tested solutions they can offer you. We all have down days - I used to eat cake and watch trashy TV to get through them - they pass though, don't they - that's the good thing.  My treatment finished in 2016 - it took me a long time to accept my flat breast but with the help of lovely people on here, I got there. I really quite like it now - it's just me - just as my big feet or broken nose are. It all takes time and the real emotional recovery starts once treatment finishes. Allow yourself to feel down, but not for too long - once you've done it for a bit, mentally put it away and do something enjoyable.  You'll get through and one day you will be looking back at this and thinking wow - did it really happen?

      "Content": "Hi mrsox  I'm not sure if I have spoken to you about this before (it's hard to get me to be quiet about it) I had a single mastectomy, no reconstruction October 2016 but was approved for a double and can still request that if I wish - well, that's what they said at the time! Lots of surgeon's don't like to remove healthy tissue and it does seem to vary depending on your surgeon, your hospital and your reasons. My reasoning was for symmetry and not too much about getting cancer in the other breast although, of course, that is always in my mind. I had to have a few heated discussions with my surgeon and have a psychological assessment but they agreed to do a bilateral at the same time as removing the tumour. A WLE wasn't an option for me because of the size of the tumour and the fact that there were 2 smaller ones also. If your surgeon's are considering it (don't know which way the 60/40 is) then try to write down your reasoning and any responses to their arguments and see if you can open up that discussion again. As an example, my surgeon told me that no breast meant no follow up which he considered a risk, but then there is a higher risk of recurrence on my mastectomy side and I get no follow up there - just a mammogram on the other so I put that to him - along with other things. I think that, truly, they want to do what will be right for each of us, but they don't know us and only see us for 10 minutes here and there. They also have to follow the hospital ethos. My surgeon was very open about the fact that he has seen women make this decision and then regret it - probably his most powerful argument to me was that he would do whatever was needed to make me happy but that the only thing he couldn't do was give me my own breast back. I eventually decided not to have it done at the same time because I just had too much going on with chemo after effects. I am a wreck with surgery so am unlikely to ever ask for it but it's comforting to know it's there. Having got to know my surgeon better when I was seeing him 2/3 times a week with a seroma infection - I believe he had my best interests at heart.  If you are adamant that you want a bilateral then maybe raise it again and see if you can convince them. If they offer a psychological assessment - I would say go for it- I was a bit outraged about it at the time but the session really clarified things for me and showed me some things about my character that explained a lot!!!! hahaha. Hope the bone scan goes well R",

      "Content": "Hi all An interesting article - it's always difficult when looking at cancer incidence in other countries - I'm sure there's more than diet involved. Just to add my own view - I could have been the poster girl for healthy eating - don't like dairy - added natural yoghurt to my diet on doctors orders when I was diagnosed with osteopenia in my 30s but eat lots of kale for calcium, aim for 7 fruit/veg a day, don't eat processed foods, don't add sugar to foods, don't eat a lot of meat, drink water all day, exercise every day - got cancer anyway! When I hear people say the best way to avoid recurrence is to make lifestyle changes, I wonder what I'm supposed to do - giving up alcohol is the only thing I can do. There has to be a balance, I suppose - I met a holocaust camp survivor once who told me \"being alive is the thing\"  and it has always stuck with me but I'm not sure how much time and energy I want to put into meticulously planning my diet when my experience tells me there's more to it. I think I'd rather spend the time planning in a more positive way - planning things to enjoy - things to do rather than things to avoid! R",

In the end she said she'd recommend 6 weeks to be on the safe side - whether that was purely to take me up to my op I don't know!

Please be reassured that, should it turn out to be breast cancer, it is very treatable. Outcomes are good and you will find people on this site that are many years past treatment. We are a very friendly and supportive bunch and are here for you whenever you need. It will seem like a long wait till Friday, I'm sure but try to distract yourself - lots to do this time of year - and don't spend all your time worrying. It's a good idea to take someone with you to your results appointment - there may be lots of information to take in - if they are certain it is to be removed whatever it is then there will at least be information about surgery. You think you are listening at the time but somehow it all seems to get lost the minute you walk out the door - someone else can listen for you - or even take notes.

When I was in my early 30's I found a lump in my breast and went to my GP who referred me to the breast clinic where they did a manual examination, mammogram and ultrasound. It turned out to be a cyst, but at no point did anyone make me feel that I shouldn't have got it checked. In fact, at the ultrasound, they were adamant that I must keep checking and never assume that new lumps would be a cyst but to get each and every one checked - and that is how I found my breast cancer all these years later, in time for it to be treated. If you prefer some professional advice on this then there is a special Ask About Breast Cancer section on the website this month where the experts answer questions - they aim to get back to you in 2 working days. Perhaps that would be a step closer to going to your GP. R",

However, when I spoke to the oncologist about it, he said they could give me Tamoxifen with daily mini aspirin (75mg with gastric resistant coating) Perhaps that is an option for you? I also think the blood test is only conclusive once you've been a while without a period - he said he wouldn't blood test me for a few months. I could be wrong about that though. In the end, they decided I didn't have a clot risk so just Tamoxifen. I am to take mine after my radiotherapy. Hope you get a good solution! R",

      "Content": "Hi suzy543 Just jumping in about the PN. Your oncologist sounds dismissive to say the least - definitely ask to see someone else within the hospital team if you can - you should be comfortable with your team. I had pretty bad PN when I was having treatment - it was the Docetaxel chemo I had. My oncology team told me they were going ahead with treatment regardless even though there was a risk it would be permanent (because of an issue with my liver at one point). They were pretty ruthless! I was on board with it, though and had told them to throw anything they could at me and that is the difference. This is your treatment and you should be involved and not dismissed - you have a right to be involved in the decisions. I was prescribed Pyridoxine but didn't find it that helpful and I found opinion differs very much on it's effectiveness - I suspect your oncologist is in the unimpressed camp. I sort of felt that I was being given it to show willing rather than because it would help significantly. However, some people take it with success and it is certainly not going to hurt. When my consultant surgeon saw the extent of my PN he was shocked - I had trouble holding a pen and signing my consent for surgery - so clearly the oncology team had not really recorded the extent of it. My surgeon paid more attention to it and asked questions and got me to do some tests to see what I could feel - the oncologists had never done that. I assume that the oncologists maybe see it differently and think it is an acceptable price for us to pay, but really, that should be our decision. BUT - on to more positive stuff. My treatment was in 2016 and it did resolve. I have very slight residual numbness in the very tips of my fingers and toes but nothing that hinders me in any way. For most people it does resolve in time, and there are quite a few people here who have had issues with it during treatment. You are definitely not alone. I think a little word with your BCN might be helpful - they might be able to suggest the best route for you to see a different oncologist. I hope your radiotherapy is going well - remember how well you have done to get this far. I think we all feel a little bereft as treatment comes to an end. In a way, we have dealt with the immediate threat, we know we are on the road to recovery and we can finally deal with our emotions properly.  We are all here for you whenever you feel alone - we completely understand what you're going through and we will cheer you on as you get to that finishing line!

You could approach them for some information as they are not chemo specialists - they may not recommend their system for chemo. Generally, most people advise a synthetic wig whilst having chemo and then other solutions after hair has re-grown a bit. Partly this is due to sensitivity and ease of use. I know that it is hugely daunting to face losing your hair and it's difficult to imagine being able to face the world, but a lot of people find that they don't mind as much as they thought or they don't like wigs or they don't like hats or whatever. It's difficult to predict how you feel until it happens. I thought I wouldn't care, but then found out I actually cared a lot. After a while I did get more used to it though. It would be a shame to invest a lot of money into a solution then find it wasn't right for you. Are you going to try the cold cap?

I do know that the pigment used is the same as in hair dyes but at a much stronger concentration (so they can leave it on for less time) which would suggest you are more likely to have a reaction. I know some therapists and I don't think they'd do it - reactions can be severe and involve hospital treatment. Probably not what you wanted to hear - sorry R",

      "Content": "Hi Emmaj91 Welcome to the online community. Sorry to hear that you have this worry. If your GP has referred you for an urgent appointment, then you should be seen within 2 weeks and that length of time shouldn't change because of your age.  It is much, much less common for younger women to have breast cancer, and we have had some people on here who have felt they weren't taken as seriously, but I think that depends on your hospital.  The waiting is awful and there isn't anything that will take it away entirely, but I'd recommend trying to distract yourself as much as you can and avoid googling your symptoms - there's lots of nonsense out there. Of course, look at the reputable websites like Macmillan, Breast Cancer Care, Cancer Research UK if that helps - but stay away from the darker corners of the internet. Different places operate slightly differently - some have a sort of one-stop-shop set up, others will do an examination and book separate appointments for tests. Generally, you should be seen by some one from the breast surgery team. They will do a manual exam and ask you some questions. If they think it's necessary, they'll then send you for a mammogram and possibly ultrasound. This might be on the same day or they might make appointments for you.  The mammogram is basically an x-ray of your breasts - you will stand in front of the machine and they will help you place your breast onto a flat metal plate. They will then lower a second plate to flatten your breast and take the x-ray. Sometimes they repeat this at different angles. Depending on how the x-ray looks - they may send you for an ultrasound scan. You will lay on a couch and they will gently roll a small machine over your breasts to produce images on a screen. If you've ever seen someone have a pregnancy ultrasound - it's just like this. There may then be a core biopsy. You will be given a local anaesthetic and they will take a sample of anything they find. It is done with a needle and the worst bit is the noise - It sounds like a stapler. Biopsies usually take a few days to process so if they take one they will normally give you an appointment to go back for the results It's important to remember that the tests do different things so being sent for them doesn't always mean it's bad news. The mammogram can pinpoint something which looks unusual and the ultrasound gives a clearer picture of what that is. if there is something there and they can't tell what it is, then a biopsy tells them what it's made of. Please be assured, something like 90% of lumps referred to the breast clinic turn out to be something other than cancer. Of those that are cancer, about 90% are treated successfully. I have been referred to the breast clinic twice - once at about 30 which turned out to be cysts and once at 47 which turned out to be cancer. Both times I was seen within 2 weeks and had a manual exam, mammogram and ultrasound. It's a good idea to take someone with you to the appointment for a couple of reasons - you may find yourself emotional regardless of the result simply because of the stress of it all. Also there may be a lot of waiting around and that is always better with company.  We'll be thinking of you - let us know how you get on. R",

      "Content": "Hi susanneg Sorry this will probably be a lengthy reply! I am in a similar position though my surgery is in 2 weeks. I have asked for bilateral mastectomy for symmetry and ease - I like to run and exercise a lot and can't imagine doing that with a prosthesis - it is also quite difficult to find high impact post surgery sports bras! I won't deny there is also a fear of cancer in the other breast but it is not my main motivation - more like a bonus. However, the \"medical people\" seem to understand the fear aspect more than the cosmetic. My consultant doesn't really agree with my choice but he has said he will do whatever I want but wants to make sure I am making the right choice for me. I had a discussion with my BCN initially and another lengthy and heated discussion/argument with my consultant surgeon. I think he said it had to go to the MDT but I may be confused - no-one has mentioned it since and I am booked in now - perhaps they just agreed. I did have to have a psychological assessment which I believe is standard for this type of request. The psychologist I saw said it was very unusual and he wanted to discuss it with his consultant before he said yes - he then phoned me the next day with more questions but did agree I was capable of making the decision. I found the psychological assessment pretty intense but it ultimately clarified things for me - that I am concerned with the visual aspect of everything, that I am a perfectionist, that I am thinking about the impact on something which is a large part of my life. Ironically - now they have agreed and it is just around the corner, I am questioning my decision hahaha!  I saw my consultant a few days ago and had another discussion. His preference has always been to do one at a time but I don't want to be facing more surgeries - I have huge anxiety over the operation to the extent that we have had to discuss what they will do if I run away or refuse up to the point of anaesthetic! I am a definite flight risk. However, I am now considering whether I should have some time to see how I feel living with one breast (not that I will ever let my surgeon think he might have been right) So the point of telling you all this is partly to let you know you are not alone in your thinking (to me, they come as a pair!) but also to let you know you can go down this road and change your mind. My surgeon has asked me to make a decision by next week if I can so that they can make use of the theatre time if I don't need it - which I think is very reasonable. My choice is agreed now so if I have a single mastectomy now - I can ask for the other when I am ready. I can also change my mind and have a reconstruction later whether I choose single or double mastectomy. Have you seen a plastic surgeon yet? When I found out the implications of what was possible for me, it helped me make my decision - I was fairly reluctant but thought I might have reconstruction if the outcome would be \"liveable\". Once I was told the scenario for my size and shape of breast, I knew for sure I didn't want it but there is always the chance you might find the opposite. I completely understand how emotional and difficult this decision is and I admire all the women who make clear and firm decisions early on. However - you are you and this decision is to please only you so you will need to spend some time thinking about it, finding what you think is the best solution ( I think of it as the option I will hate the least - not very positive but works for me) and jumping in, knowing that you can change your mind!  I look forward to reading the other replies. Wishing you good luck and some ease making your decision! R",

      "Content": "Hi susanneg Thanks for the link to the article - interesting. I note symmetry was listed as a reason so clearly it is not as unusual as they would have us believe!  I completely understand this issue being the one that triggered an emotional respone for you. All along I have been told by my team that \"surgery is the easy bit\" and I suppose in one sense it is - relatively short and by now routine procedure - but it is the bit where they take our breast away and it all becomes very real. Like you, I had chemo first so was able to indulge in a bit of denial about the surgery and it then hit me when everyone started to want to make plans about halfway through chemo. It has been the hardest decision I have ever had to make! I wouldn't describe my surgeon as warm but he is nice - and honest when pressed! One of the things he did say to me was that he sees lots of women go through breast cancer and sometimes they regret their decisions. He said that the point of the psychological assessment was so that they could be sure that I wasn't going to turn around after surgery and say \"why did you let me do that?\" Actually, as cynical as I am, I believe that it would upset him on a professional level if that happened rather than being a butt-saving exercise. Now that we have agreed that my decision is right for me, he is openly concerned about making a nice flat chest with a neat scar. I sometimes forget that they are professionals who want to be proud of what they do. I was fully anticipating a much bigger fight when I asked for bilateral and was prepared to argue on very feminist/chauvinism grounds - along the lines of why is it acceptable that I have  countless surgeries to achieve symmetry so long as I have breasts at the end of it - but not acceptable that I achieve symmetry by doing without breasts? Luckily it didn't get to that, but in our enlightened times, I don't see how any trust can get away with refusing bilateral for symmetry. I think your surgeon needs to address this with you even if you decide to have reduction - or even reconstruction - it's important that you feel you have been given every option and made a decision that is right not just the one recommended!  A little note on my reasons for considering a unilateral first - I responded to another post here and made the point that what we all really want is to keep our own breast and that is the one thing they can never give us back. Up until that point - I hadn't said that to myself and it sowed a tiny seed of doubt which has made me consider being cautious - I am still certain I would rather be flat. That's what is so great about these forums - they give us the opportunity to clarify things! Interesting coincidence - I am also a college lecturer (I teach hairdressing and media makeup) and I think that idea of being \"on show\" does impact on our decisions - we need to be able to project a strong, authorative image so we need to be confident. Finally - here is a link to a web page about living without reconstruction in case you haven't come across it - the images helped me. http://breastfree.org/ Good luck with your next appointment - let us know how you get on!

      "Content": "Hi Lelotron I'm sorry to hear about your Dad - it must be very hard for you to deal with this diagnosis while you are still grieving. You do have some say in your treatment but doctors are very reluctant to remove what they see as healthy tissue. Last year, I went down the route of requesting a double mastectomy (which I didn't have in the end) and my surgeon was very reluctant to agree it because he said he had known women request it and then regret it later. He also argued that the chance of developing cancer in the \"healthy\" breast was only slightly higher than for someone who had never had breast cancer. Having said that, he was absolutely adamant that I needed a mastectomy instead of a WLE because I had more than one tumour and he thought it was safer - not all surgeons insist on that so he was definitely a \"belt and braces\" person but still thought a bilateral was unnecessary. My reasons were slightly different though because I was thinking more about the symmetry as I didn't want a reconstruction. To play devil's advocate - when you have a mastectomy, you have no follow up so would be responsible for checking for any recurrence yourself. I had a left mastectomy last year with no reconstruction and although I get a yearly mammogram on my right breast, there is nothing on the left. It is so difficult for us to make these decisions when we are diagnosed - our minds are all over the place and we need to see so many different people and have very little time to research. Have you thought about your reconstruction options? That might factor into the decision that you make - for example it's usual to have implants if you are having a bilateral mastectomy as not everyone would have enough tissue for a flap reconstruction. Also - you could always try to get an agreement for it in the future. I argued for my bilateral but was conflicted because I was dealing with some after effects of chemo so my surgeon suggested I get approval (I had to have a psychological assessment) but keep it as an option for the future and that's what I did in the end. I have the option to request it but as time goes on I feel less and less inclined to go through more surgery It's completely understandable that you are worried but hopefully your other aches and pains will turn out to be anxiety related - worry and stress can cause havoc with our bodies. You have a little bit of time to think about your options and it might be worth making an appointment to have another discussion - maybe with your BCN? It's a tough decision and I hope you can find the right solution for you! R",

Do have a look at the thread toxophilite has given you a link to - it's within this breast cancer group, but it's something we keep going so that everyone on chemo can find each other easily - it can be a real help. First chemo is bound to be a worry - you're not sure what to expect. I was also given the advice that I should still live my life. One of my chemo nurses explained it like this - \"I'm not going to tell you that you can't get on a bus, just don't get on one at rush hour, if someone is obviously ill and sits next to you, move and always sanitise your hands when you get off\" That helped me to understand the level of caution I should have. I would always say it's better to be safe than sorry, but treatment will be much harder if you lock yourself away with no contact.  As for staying calm - hmmm, I'm not so good at that - how about a nice scented candle, a good comedy and stay away from Dr Google - and plenty of time on here, I guess!

If you mix it with anything - a seperate lotion or even water - then it can potentially have the same reaction as any other hair dye. That's possible allergy or scalp sensitivity. Even henna which is ground up leaves can cause an allergy. The issue with chemo is mainly your scalp rather than your hair - though that can be fragile too. Also, colouring white hair is not as easy as picking a colour and applying it as they are designed to be applied to hair that has pigment so you could end up with something orangey, yellow etc. If you have a hairdresser you trust, they should be able to patch test you as a precaution and use a technique that keeps the dye away from the scalp - like highlights. I would also give a vote for grey or white hair - very in just now - I bet you look fabulous! R",

      "Content": "Hi Yes I do get the bra pulling to the right and prosthesis drift - I don't have my silicone one yet so am hoping that will be better - maybe not. Logic tells me the real breast must be bigger/heavier and demanding more bra but after my op my BCN said it was because the softie was too big - I don't have much faith in her though. I have thought about using tit tape to keep the bra in place but as the cup stands away from my flat bit, don't know where I'd put it! I just ignore it - if anyone's looking  at my breasts that much, they need a talking to! DoraD - I don't know of anywhere that does custom prosthesis but I do know some people who make prosthetics for films and also make silicone babies. Before my mastectomy, I considered getting a cast of my breast made so that I could get a silicone replica - that would be a fairly easy job for someone like that - but they could also sculpt one  - you could always make enquiries with some companies if you fancy it.  I've also wondered if the stick on prosthesis would be better - anyone tried one? Sometimes I think I'm overthinking it all - I'm not sure my old breast was all that! R",

There's nothing wrong with that - but there's also nothing wrong with admitting we were content with life before and want it to continue just the same.

      "Content": "Hi Violet blue Welcome to the forums and sorry you find yourself in this position. I was diagnosed last February and had my op in October (chemo first) so had plenty of thinking time. I chose a mastectomy without reconstruction. You are right - it's a big deal.  One important thing to remember is that this doesn't have to be your final decision. You can change your mind and have a reconstruction later or have one removed. I actually asked for a bilateral mastectomy for symmetry - my breasts were reasonably large. I ended up having only one removed with the option of having the other removed when I am ready. I am not keen on the lopsided me, but whether I will ever pluck up the courage for another operation, I don't know. However, I have always been indifferent to my breasts - I'm just not a woman who feels attachment to them anymore than to other body parts but I know other women do so my choice would not be right for them. There are a couple of things that helped me with my decision - one was looking at (non-gory) images and the other was something I read in a breast cancer book written by a breast surgeon.She said she always tells her patients that they are all false breasts - you are deciding whether you want to wear them under or over your skin. Here's a website where you can see good images of flat mastectomies http://breastfree.org/ Feel free to ask any other questions you have. R",

I did run through half my chemo - my oncologist was a little shocked but said it was fine if I could manage it. Once I had a Hickman line in, I stopped because I was worried about getting all sweaty under the dressing and getting an infection. I also got more tired as the T treatments went on. However, my treatment finished last year and I got myself back to exercise very slowly and in April had worked myself up to running for 4 minutes! I was so proud! I have just joined an exercise rehabilitation programme at my hospital and they have told me to stop the running. I still have fatigue and was told exercise  would help and I do love running! So thought I was doing well but they have told me it's too much and I have to admit that since I stopped, the fatigue is much better. So I am realising that there isn't one solution for everyone and it isn't always a good thing to push ourselves. It is very difficult and very frustrating to be exercising at the pace they want me to but I have to accept it is what's right for my body. I didn't need exercise - I needed rest! So see how you feel, but try to listen to your body and find what is the right thing for you - maybe running, maybe not. Good luck R",

Actually, it wasn't too bad though because there was this other nail underneath. I taped mine with lint and micro pore  - I'll try to post a photo - I drew a little man on my thumb to try to lighten myself up about it. I kept them as short as possible and cut them almost every day to stop them catching on things - I wore gloves to wash - I even got a box of something called finger cots - they look for all the world like little condoms that go on individual fingers and I wore them for anything that might snag them. I also bought tools like a pill popper and avoided doing anything like opening cans, cartons etc - you can get tools for most of these things. Now I am writing this, I can see it was all a bit extreme but for me, too, this was much worse than losing my hair. My nails were all black and green and I thought they were infected but the GP said no just a bad reaction. They grew back eventually but were weak for a long time - at least a year. Ha ha - here is my silly taped thumb - this sort of behaviour is optional, of course Not all mine came off entirely, a lot just peeled as they grew up, so let's hope yours don't get too bad. R",

      "Content": "Hi 3301apk Firstly, I will out myself as a hairdresser before I say the best thing is to involve your hairdresser! The not colouring thing is largely to do with scalp sensitivity after chemo which can lead to a reaction - this can happen with any colours you mix, even some of the ones you mix with water - the reaction can come from the ingredients in the dyes themselves and not the thing you mix them with. Lots of people do colour their hair straight away without a problem but if you do develop a reaction, it can be something you will then have for ever so I think it's a big risk to take. Colouring white hair is not always simple either and some post chemo hair can be resistant and harder to colour. Doing it yourself can lead to some unexpected results. By far the safest is the colour shampoos you suggest - a lot of salons sell a range of them and would be able to give you advice - you'll get more colour choice than in a chemist and some expert help. Of course they may try to convince you to book an appointment, but on the whole, we are a pretty compassionate and helpful bunch of people and I'm sure you'll find them only too willing to recommend something that will work for you. I am a year since my last chemo and only just about to colour my hair - and I've coloured it since I was 14!

It depends on what is concerning you - if it's fear - lots of us here have been through chemo with few side effects. If you are otherwise fit and well, there's every chance you'll cope well.  I didn't work while on chemo because I teach and the infection risk is ever present in a college. I got on with life though - even managed to run 3 times a week through the first 4 treatments. Pennymoon is quite right - things have changed! It's not a walk in the park but it's very manageable! I have far worse side effects from surgery and radiotherapy than from chemo. I think the chemo side effects are so visible that it scares people. They can handle most side effects with the right drugs and as long as you follow the hygiene rules and take your temperature regularly you can minimise the risks. It's a tough call - if you are hormone positive then you have hormone therapy to fall back on, but chemo is a very effective whole body treatment - I'm glad I've had it. You can always ask for another oncology appointment if you need it. Good luck making this difficult decision R",

It might be a usual reaction to an operation, but it's always a good idea to get things checked if they are worrying you - if nothing else, it puts your mind at rest. Was this done at a breast clinic? if so you should be able to call them and ask if they think you need to go in.  What about painkillers? if the usual Over-the-counter ones aren't helping then you could see your GP and ask for something stronger. That might be enough to get you back to work and help till you see your consultant if you don't need to go to the clinic If money becomes an issue then there are some lovely people on the helpline who can give you advice about relevant benefits etc They are open Monday to Friday 9am to 8pm - 0808 808 00 00 Hope it's better soon R",

      "Content": "Hi I'm posting this because I see the 'is this normal?' threads quite often and I know it can seem disappointing when you feel that you're not doing as well as you should, because that has been me! I've also realised that there are people who read and don't post so this is just some reassurance in case there is anyone who feels like I've been feeling. Well, it's been 7 weeks since my mastectomy and node clearance and they have been a long 7 weeks!  Like loads of us, before cancer I lived my life at 100mph - work, family, exercise, hobbies, socialising and that has all screeched to a halt and it has been the hardest thing for me to deal with, so when I didn't bounce back after the operation, it really got me down! I've not been able to sleep; I've not been able to get up in the mornings; I've needed a nap after doing anything; I've not been able to drive; I've had pain in the bits that are there and the bits that have gone; I do my exercises but the progress is so slow and I still don't have full movement; I've not been able to shop and cook properly; There have been days when I struggled to motivate myself to do anything. It has just been pants! -  and it has felt like forever! When I run up a hill, I look at the ground so that it's not about the whole hill, just the next step - and that's how I've been dealing with my cancer. Today, I finally had the energy to look up and realise that I have come a long way already and that I am closer to the top and I am going to get there.   I'm not back to normal - I'm not even as fit and well as I was during chemo, and I start radiotherapy next week and probably have to deal with another lot of issues and side effects, but I am just so glad that today I feel myself again - I managed a little drive and a lap of the park and didn't need a nap! I feel motivated now. So I just wanted to say to anyone who is post op and struggling or feels despondent, that it does get better - a lot of people are over it in a few weeks, but some of us need longer! No matter how long it takes we will all get there eventually! R",

I have nerve damage in my chest and arm and have physio exercises I do daily, I also have a lump under my arm left from surgery which may be a dog ear and I was booked to see my consultant on 13th March. I have now broken my right arm so my left is doing more work than usual but I've been careful not to do repetitive or heavy work. This week I have noticed tenderness in the surgey area and yesterday my chest became swollen. It's like a small, hard breast - \"my first bra\" sized, the skin is stretched and shiny but not red and not fluidy. I've spoken to my BCN who has made me an appointment for Monday. Now I have a couple of worries - one is that my consultant is on holiday (how dare he! Haha) so I am booked with someone else and my BCN wants me to discuss the dog ear with him. I'm not really good with change - is that just me? I don't mind seeing him for the swelling but not sure about discussing the dog ear, don't really know why. The other worry is that my BCN said she wanted it to be Monday so there was access to imaging - so that is panicking me a little bit - she did say it's too difficult to guess anything without seeing it but of course I'm now imagining all sorts! Has anyone else had anything like this? Or any words of wisdom Thanks R",

      "Content": "Hi tiger-777 It's a hard decision isn't it. I thought I'd reply as trying to make that decision was what brought me to this site about a year ago. I am a 34F and was initially told lumpectomy but they found a second tumour so advised a mastectomy. I had chemo first so had lots of time to think about it - and I did - round and round in circles. Funnily enough, after all that thinking and research, I've ended up with exactly what I would have agreed to on my very first appointment! I had a unilateral mastectomy. I really didn't like the plastic surgeon I met and having a reduction on the other breast was never suggested to me, but lots of tweaking and lifting was spoken about and it put me off reconstruction. I then asked for a bilateral mastectomy - my thinking was that I'd then be even and could choose whether or not to wear prosthesis and could choose the size (tidy B or C cup). I had to have a psychological assessment which is standard at my hospital and my surgeon agreed to it. Then I decided not to have it done at the same time. That was what my surgeon wanted and I was so fed up with some of the lingering effects from chemo I just couldnt face the thought of 2 arms that didn't want to move. It's in reserve for another time. Anyway - the point of telling you all that is - now it is about 8 months since my surgery and a lot of the problems I imagined haven't occured. One major thing is that chemo seems to have made my remaining breast much softer and lighter and less dense (I had very lumpy dense breasts with multiple cysts when I was diagnosed) so I have never felt the difference in weight and I am coping with a non-wired bra which I didn't think I would. I was so worried about the weight of a prosthesis and how it would feel when I went running - but I haven't even been for the fitting yet - I just wear a softie or a knitted knocker and I don't notice. I was worried about how it would feel if I didn't wear a prosthesis in bed because I sleep on my front - I don't notice. I am the kind of person who gets bogged down in the detail but I was probably overthinking it all - you probably know deep down what you want and that's what you should ask to have. Try to have a very honest discussion with all your team - it was actually my BCN who was helpful and supportive on this although she was fairly useless at everything else. Also, see what the situation is about future treatment - when I asked my plastic surgeon about corrections if I changed my mind he gave a massive sigh so I didn't feel I'd be able to backtrack if I hated it. When I asked my breast surgeon, though, he told me he wanted me to be happy so I could have whatever I wanted within reason - it made me more comfortable about making the decision. Whatever you choose doesn't have to be permanent - and there is every possibility that you will find that you adapt to whatever you have - our brains can do a great job of  compensating so we don't notice things - I knocked my softie the other day then grabbed it to minimise the pain - took a few seconds to register why it wasn't hurting!  There are lots of fantastc women here who  can advocate for reductions and reconstructions etc and they'll be along to help - I just wanted to reassure you that a bigger breast might not be as much of a problem as you think. Good luck with the decision - I know how tough it can be! R",

      "Content": "Hi Beth567 10 days is still early. You have had to deal with the traumatic experience of surgery and recovery, as well as the emotional issue of losing parts of your body, and adapting to the new visual image of yourself. It takes time. I think I may have recommended the pictures to you - and probably said that I am quite fond of my scar now. I am but it took time - months rather than years, but certainly not days. At this stage, you are not yet properly healed and your skin hasn't settled - this isn't how it will look in a couple of months.  I think you said you will be having reconstruction in the future? I am no psychologist, but I imagine that is harder to deal with in a way. For me it was a choice to not have reconstruction so there was more incentive for my mind to find positives, but if you do want a reconstruction, then that is what your mind will be accepting as a final result, so it is harder to accept what you see now - if it isn't your end goal. Have you had a post surgery check up? You could ask your team about the fluid - usually your body will absorb it, but you might want to get it checked to reassure yourself. I didn't wear a proper bra for about 3 weeks - I wore a soft, front fastening post-surgery bra with a softie only if I was out the house. To be honest, I waited nearly a year to get my silicone prosthesis. Does it get better? Yes, Yes, Yes! Be kind to yourself - allow yourself to grieve for what you have lost. How would you treat a friend in this situation? Be at least as kind to yourself. Once you are fully healed, massaging helps - I'd give your team a call and see what they recommend. The physio at my breast clinic taught us to massage by drawing the alphabet with our palms - she said it was the right amount of time and made sure you were massaging in all directions. Hope you are feeling a bit better this evening - sending some hugs your way R",

I just wanted to say a couple of things - Firstly, I was diagnosed February 2016 and haven't made it back to work yet for one reason or another. I am both self employed and on a zero hours teaching contract - there is more financial help than you might think and I would definitely suggest giving the Macmillan helpline a call about that. It really is the last thing you need on top of cancer treatment but once it is sorted out then there is one less worry. However - the big one is your clients. I lost everything - clients gone (I work in hairdressing/make up not gardening) teaching hours given to someone else and I find myself approaching 50 with all my savings used up and not a clue what my life should look like or where I go from here. BUT - I don't really care as much now as I did at the start of treatment, I guess my priorities changed. I'm not trying to give you the 'cancer changes you' speech - I didn't want it to change me and I've not had a huge epiphany about the meaning of life etc. I've just found that once it was all taken away it wasn't as bad as I imagined. I think your oncology team are the best people to ask about working during chemo. I was told absolutely not because of the infection risk and I did as I was told but physically I could have managed.

Firstly, you should be under a consultant - you might not always meet him or her but presumably that person exists somewhere and you should be able to request to see them. grannymush37 has given you some good advice but I wanted to let you know that a similar thing happened to me. Did the increase in tumour size and the other breast get picked up by a scan? Mine was my MRI - that gave a slightly increased tumour size, showed another tumour they hadn't seen on ultrasound (a third showed up in the pathology after my mastectomy) and a suspected tumour in my other breast which they couldn't find after a second lot of ultrasounds and biopsies - it niggles at the back of my mind still and I am 6 months post treatment. I found all this out the day before my first chemo - got an emergency appointment for ultrasounds and biopsies the morning of my first chemo treatment and promptly turned up at the chemo unit in tears, refusing to have chemo and completely bewildered as to why the plan hadn't changed.  Different scans show different things so this can sometimes happen, but of course no matter how this came about, you need to have confidence in your team and it sounds like this has shaken yours. You can always ask to see your consultant - or one of his team and should be allowed as many appointments as you need - I was quite a pest at times but I wanted to be comfortable and confident about my treatment. If you haven't already contacted your BCN - that sounds like a good start - someone to explain it all, how it happened etc. Mine was also a kind of gatekeeper to my consultant - I had to see her first and if she couldn't answer my questions (which was most of the time) she would make an appointment for me to see the consultant again.

Perhaps your GP is being thoughtful? Even if they do show something - it doesn't mean it's cancer - MRIs show up lots of things that aren't cancer.

      "Content": "Hi Scaredgirl34 Yes this all sounds normal. Breast cancer treatment is very effective these days and the medical professionals know exactly what they're doing. Unfortunately, sometimes I think they forget we worry and can \"drip feed\" information to us. I'm sure that's helpful to some people. It's very much like a conveyor belt of treatment. My hospital do a bone scan, CT scan and MRI as standard and I had them before we knew my nodes were affected, but not all hospitals do. I think a chat with your BCN is a good idea.  The diagnosis stage is worrying and frightening - once treatment starts you will feel better.  Positive nodes show that the cancer was trying to spread but as others have said - the lymph nodes are there to catch them and chemo is a full-body treatment that is very effective in killing off individual cancer cells. It would be pointless to tell you not to worry, but try to distract yourself and contact your unit on Monday. I felt I had to be very pro-active as a patient. Help was definitely there but I had to ask for it - it wasn't often suggested to me - so give your nurse a call and see if she can chat with you - if not there might be other options she can suggest. We are all here for you too - this site was my main source of support and information there are a lot of lovely understanding and helpful people to get you through this. R",

      "Content": "Hi LittleWren I'm afraid I can't give you any advice but I am in the same situation - I'm 48 and last chemo is next week. I am also a bit undecided and no-one close to me wants to discuss it. Have you had a discussion about the different reconstruction options and exactly what is involved? It's very difficult to make a decision until you have all the facts. I don't know what surgery you're scheduled for but you should be able to change your mind afterwards - my surgeon has told me that I can change my mind and have as many surgeries as I need within reason (ironically, I am keen to have as little surgery as possible) Don't worry too much about what other people have - what is right for them might not be right for you. Recovery time is an issue for me too but that can be different for different people so is hard to judge. If you get on well with your breast care nurse maybe have a chat with them - mine was sympathetic to my feelings and supportive - my surgeon is more opinionated but then he is looking at it from a surgical point of view - that's his job. You will most likely make the right decision for you but if not you can change it later. Good luck - hope you feel better after the meeting! R",

Everyone else has given you great advice already and there isn't an awful lot that I can add other than to say that at the beginning of 2016 I was diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer - the initial lump was 5cm but then they found another in the same breast and it was in both the sentinel nodes they removed. I had chemo, a full mastectomy, full lymph node removal and radiotherapy. Today is the 2 year anniversary of the end of my treatment. When I was at the point you are now, I could never have imagined being through it and getting on with my life - but I did and I am. For now, it's hard but it will end and there is life afterwards - head down and take it one step at a time. It's difficult to not worry but don't let your imagination run riot. There are many of us here who have been through treatment and are still here to let you know you can do it.

It was actually my GP who said to me \"this is enough - it's affecting your quality of life and you need to do something about it\" Mine was due to fibroids (I knew this already) and the gynae suggested hysterectomy if it continued after BC treatment - or to ask for Zoladex from the onc team (I was hormone positive). Thankfully, treatment stopped my periods. I'm assuming you are not on any hormone treatment? If you are then going through your breast clinic might be an alternative route - Tamoxifen can cause issues with the womb and they could refer you to gynaecology. Otherwise, go to your GP and ask/demand to be referred. I suspect that as your bleeds aren't too  frequent, they are trying less invasive options and hoping that menopause will kick in naturally, but coping with that amount of bleeding is difficult. Put your foot down and get this sorted in a way that suits you - at the very least you need a chat with a specialist. R",

My theory on not having reconstruction is based on a lot of things and honestly - if I had had the surgery first, I would probably have gone for DIEP flap. Weirdly, they offered implants too and said it would just be uncomfortable after radiotherapy. To be honest - I hated the surgeon I saw (have been offered a second consultation with someone else) so stopped listening really! Implants aren't a good choice for my size - apparently there's no choice in shape in larger sizes. I am also self employed and want to recover from surgery as quickly as possible and I have always been very active and a keen runner and want to be able to feel I am getting a little fitter as soon as possible - though I know it will be a while yet! My surgeon is quite clear he thinks I am making a mistake and wants me to give myself the option of future reconstruction! We'll see! It's all so difficult isn't it - I have friends who've been through this and give different advice - if only we could try them out beforehand and then choose! Then again, I try to tell myself this is just \"mopping up\" - that getting rid of the cancer is the thing and what I'm left with will always be liveable! Good luck with the plastics meeting - hope you get a nice surgeon! and with the op of course!!!",

He said that it is possible to take Tamoxifen pre and post menopause and that the reason they now switch people on to AI's post menopause is that research shows better survival rates for women who switch. I was wary of the AI's because of the side effects and he has put me on Tamoxifen and to review my decision after a year (I have treatment induced menopause) He told me I can stay on Tamoxifen the whole 10 years if that's what I want but it isn't his advice. I know people who take it with no side effects - I get hot flushes but probably would in natural menopause anyway. Lots of people find the brand makes a difference so you could give it a try and see how it goes and then try a different brand if you have problems.

      "Content": "Hi Purplejan It's an absolutely huge decision to make - and only you will ultimately know what is right for you. I had grade 2 IDC, node involvement, 5cm main tumour - multi focal so WLE was not an option and am coming up to 4 weeks post mastectomy. I had chemo first as the second tumour was found too late to change course - this gave me 6 months of thinking and researching time. What I ultimately decided was that I wanted a bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction - I have not had that - though I can opt for it in time. I had to have many meetings, discussions and a psychological assessment to be approved for it so thought I'd share what was said to me. My decision was mainly about symmetry and not wanting to wear a prosthetic 24/7 (I ruled out reconstruction as an option for me early on) Those ideas seem difficult for the medical team to understand and it was assumed I was motivated by fear - that was an element of it - true enough! My consultant kept pointing out that the greater risk was recurrence in the same breast or secondaries. Mastectomy reduces the risk of recurrence and contralateral disease - it doesn't remove it as there will always be some cells left behind. If you opt for a flap reconstruction, any cancer that develops in remaining breast cells will grow into that tissue - so you can still end up with a breast with a tumour in it. He also wanted me to understand that with no breast tissue, there is no screening. It's standard practice at my hospital to request psychological assessment in this situation - I found it more intense than I expected but it was actually helpful in clarifying my thoughts. The psychologist understood my reasoning and approved my decision. I would say that the fact it was based on symmetry and practicality reassured him - but that is partly because it fits with my personality. What they are worried about is that you will make a decision based on an exaggerated fear that you will later regret (and screening out underlying mental health issues) My surgeon gave me quite a heartfelt speech about how many women he has seen change their minds and how he didn't want me to turn around and say \"why did you let me do that?\" I am not trying to influence you at all - just sharing the information given to me. Ultimately I chose a single mastectomy because of lingering side effects from treatment - it just all felt like too much to handle!  However, my surgeon constantly reminds me that I can have further surgery on one or both breasts in time should I change my mind (within reason) Have you had a good, long discussion with any of your team? I started with my BCN. Have you discussed your reconstruction options in depth - with one and two breasts?  Bear in mind that you are now contemplating a non-essential surgery so there will be some waiting time - I was told about 6 months from the time I request it to getting an appointment - so you can go down this road and change your mind - 2 months post surgery isn't really that long - and presumably not much longer than that since diagnosis? You are probably still very emotional and that may be why you are finding it hard to make a decision. Hopefully you will find your team supportive in investigating your options - there is no cancer in your remaining breast so you can afford to take your time to make this decision and I think you'll know when your decision is right. Wishing you all the best with it R",

The other discussion that Leolady56 has given you a link to might be worth a read as it was very recent and will potentially connect you with some of our other men, but please don't assume that you will necessarily get the same side effects as someone else. We have fewer men here than women so most of the anecdotal evidence we can share with you is from a woman's perspective but I haven't read anything about Tamoxifen that suggests there is a gender difference when it comes to side effects. Depression is a side effect, but not a common one - it affects about 10% of people. Of course, depression and cancer can go hand in hand with or without Tamoxifen. A lot of people find that they tolerate one brand more than another, so if you do start to experience side effects that you find difficult to manage then speak to your GP about switching brands - they tend to automatically prescribe the cheaper ones - well why wouldn't they - but I have found both my GP and the pharmacy to be very understanding about me asking for a specific brand. I would suggest speaking to your GP about the skin itching and see if they can give you something to relieve it. There is a very comprehensive page of side effects info on the Cancer Research UK website - here's a link Hope you are recovering well R",

I haven't found recovery easy and that frustrates me because I pride myself on being tough as old boots (well, I did) I just scraped through my radiotherapy planning session and was crying with pain all through the first session. Once treatment finished, I broke my arm, then got a seroma, then an infection in the seroma, now a splint on my hand because of an inflamed tendon when I tried to go back to work. It seemed never-ending. Haven't made it back to work properly yet 18 months after diagnosis. It is tough! We think we will bounce back and everyone thinks we will be fine as soon as treatment is finished but it isn't the case for everyone. some of us take longer to heal Can you take some time off work? You are still having treatment so your GP should sign you off. I know you may not want to - how about asking for reduced hours? It's an awful lot to cope with while you are working and you do need to be kind to yourself. if you're not sure about asking for reduced work - the helpline are great at that sort of thing and can tell you what you're entitled to. I know it seems daft, but when he was treating my infection, my consultant eventually had a chat with me about how much I was doing, what I was eating etc and made me realise how much my body had been through and that I needed to rest and eat the right food to recover properly - the very old-fashioned notion of convalescence.

I'd definitely mention it to them - I have a dog ear by my node clearance scar and my surgeon said he'd correct it if I wanted. He was rather sheepish and said it was his fault (true) so I think they'd rather deal with it that way rather than as a new referral. Good luck on Wednesday - let us know how you get on. R",

      "Content": "Hi SpicedTea I will have a word with my GP for sure now!! My theory on not having reconstruction is based on a lot of things and honestly - if I had had the surgery first, I would probably have gone for DIEP flap. Weirdly, they offered implants too and said it would just be uncomfortable after radiotherapy. To be honest - I hated the surgeon I saw (have been offered a second consultation with someone else) so stopped listening really! Implants aren't a good choice for my size - apparently there's no choice in shape in larger sizes. I am also self employed and want to recover from surgery as quickly as possible and I have always been very active and a keen runner and want to be able to feel I am getting a little fitter as soon as possible - though I know it will be a while yet! My surgeon is quite clear he thinks I am making a mistake and wants me to give myself the option of future reconstruction! We'll see! It's all so difficult isn't it - I have friends who've been through this and give different advice - if only we could try them out beforehand and then choose! Then again, I try to tell myself this is just \"mopping up\" - that getting rid of the cancer is the thing and what I'm left with will always be liveable! Good luck with the plastics meeting - hope you get a nice surgeon! and with the op of course!!!",

Have no date yet as I have decided against reconstruction and queried the option of a bilateral mastectomy (no gene  just fear and simplicity) - this means a psychological assessment before the MDM agrees. Am hoping that will give me some clarity as I am currently veering madly between options now I know a decision has to be made! I know I'll be OK with it eventually - I think it's just the shock of finally moving on to the next stage of treatment!! Hope the next few weeks go well - building our strength up for surgery! R",

I didn't have reconstruction but it took me about 3 weeks to be active beyond the daily essentials. I could go out for the day shopping, socialising with friends etc but I wouldn't have been up to a really long day hill walking, for example. However, I've known people who have been doing fairly gruelling things a few days after surgery so it's very individual. Maybe speak to your team and see what they think. Is it something you can pull out of without too much trouble? If so, then you can always see how you feel nearer the time.  Hope the surgery goes well! R",

I still get occasional pain in that side if I lay that way in bed but over all things are settling down and our minds are very good at adjusting - I think my mind tells my hand that it's not hard - if that doesn't sound too ridiculous :) Hope recovery/treatment continues to go well!

      "Content": "Hi Beenie I'm going to go against the grain here and say I'm not impressed with the M+S mastectomy bra range (which is what you might need for a while) I find the cups a very odd shape and actually, they have very limited choice in larger sizes. I know they were developed with the help of women who had undergone breast surgery but they don't work for me. I didn't have recon by the way so that may make a difference, but I know other women who feel the same. Considering they are so well known for underwear - they don't even offer matching sets. Also - you have to request the VAT off at the till which annoys me - lol, not a fan can you tell? I will big up their post surgery sports bra though - the best I've found! I am a 34E/F and I struggle to find bras that fit - even the specialist suppliers offer very little in this size - it's so disappointing. I suspect you will need a partial breast form for your reconstruction side - I don't know if you will be fitted for one - it's worth speaking to your BCN, you can get your own from specialist suppliers, or you maybe able to use the cheaper \"chicken fillet\" type. So - a few suggestions: I had a bra fitting at John Lewis - they have an appallingly small post-surgery range - we should all email them! Anyway, my fitting was before my mastectomy but during treatment and they were amazing - the woman spent a couple of hours with me finding the right bra and was not at all phased by my appearance (at the time I had no hair, eyelashes etc, one blue breast and tubes coming out of my chest - not the most confidence-building look) I don't buy bras from them now because the range is so small but someone did tell me they will sew a pocket into a non surgery bra so it may be an option for you. Debenhams stock a variety of post-surgery ranges and some stores do post-surgery fittings (I think they are trained by Amoena) they also don't put VAT on their post-surgery bras so you don't have the awkwardness of asking for it to be taken off. They do their own range, too which is very reasonably priced. The lady who did my prosthesis fitting recommended Bravissimo to me - purely for the size issue. I haven't been yet (it's so expensive buying a whole new load of bras after surgery) but it has been recommended quite often by other people on here and I think they might also sew a pocket into a normal bra for you A few people on here recommended just sewing a pocket into my old bras but I don't have the sewing skills (yet- I'm working on it) but that might be an option, if you are handy with a sewing machine. You might find you are comfortable with a standard bra - I don't know. I am guessing it all depends on the size, shape and position of the partial form.  Hope you are soon able to sleep a little better! R",

Everyone is different but I certainly wasn't expecting to still feel as slow and lethargic as I have been 6 months after my treatment finished (I had chemo, surgery, rads, now on Tamoxifen) I've had some other issues too including a nasty infection and my GP thinks it's understandable to feel like that and I am taking part in a post cancer exercise programme at my hospital and the physios there do laugh gently at me, reel off everything my body has been through this last year and ask if I really expect to be bouncing around full of energy. For me, that's part of the problem - my life was fast-paced with long hours, little sleep - just always on, but I always had the energy to keep going - so this feels unbearably slow by comparison. I am a bit more forgetful and have some word-finding problems but it's slowly improving. I wanted to give you some encouragement because last Saturday I woke up to a different world - it was weird, I just knew things had changed as soon as I got up - I was me again. Nobody else would be able to see a difference, but I feel it. I told the physios at the exercise session and they immediately claimed credit for it!! Actually, I do think it's a combination of time, finding the right pace to do things and having new challenges with the exercise. It's an hour a week at the hospital gym but it's all new to me and I think that might be what has helped because I am engaging my brain and my body in learning something at the same time - does that make any sense? I feel like the fog has finally lifted. I've been warned that I can slip back and not to get too excited or overdo it but it's a relief just to know it's not permanent! So - hang in there. Now, having said all of that - of course it could be a deficiency as everyone says so best to check that out first!  Fingers crossed for you that it soon improves! R",

I put on about 2 stone over chemo in 2016 and finding it hard to lose it completely and consistently but I'll get there I'm sure. At my hospital's moving on event we were advised to follow the World Cancer Research Fund diet which is a basic healthy diet - lots of fruit and veg, whole grains and meat no more than twice a week. This was for reducing cancer risk, though - not weight loss and was a general information session for all types of cancer - not necessarily hormone positive ones so I think there is a difference. You have a very specific question.  I hope you find an answer and have success with whichever diet you choose! R",

The job of the lymph nodes is to stop infection spreading so ideally, they would catch the cancer cells and stop them escaping. We know that doesn't always happen but sometimes it does.  The idea of chemo is to kill off any stray cancer cells that have escaped.  Do you know if your tumour was oestrogen positive?  Hormone treatment is also designed to stop cells growing in the body Unfortunately there are no guarantees - but things can turn out well against the odds as well as turn out badly. I was diagnosed 9 months ago - some days I think I'm going to die tomorrow - some days I think I'll be bungee jumping for my 85th birthday! It has taken me time to get to that point, though. At first I used to cry every day - now it's every week. I am confident that eventually I won't be crying at all. It's still early days for you so of course you will worry, but try to remember that you can't predict what will happen - you can choose to dwell on it or not. You are still experiencing after effects from surgery and as time goes on you will feel better. I mentioned this book a few days ago, but I really can't recommend it enough - I read about it on here and it's been so useful to me to calm me. Dr Susan Love's breast book she explains cancer, treatment, lifestyle changes etc. I think you'll feel more settled once you get your surgery results and get started on the rest of your treatment plan.

      "Content": "Hi Islanikita That all makes perfect sense! It is such a difficult thing because we really don't feel ill a lot of the time. I also think it's hard because treatment takes so long - and is in 3 parts (for some of us) It really is our whole life for a while. I also have a friend who had breast cancer a few years ago - it is great to have someone who understands, but actually we are all different and her experience was very different to mine.  I think counselling with someone at the hospital sounds great - they will understand how you feel and be experienced with your particular issues. Venting here helps too - it's always good to know that what you're feeling is normal but I think it's so much more helpful when it's someone who has been through it rather than your BCN saying - oh everyone feels like that!  We will get there - one day at a time!

I will just add about brands, though, that different people seem to get on with different ones so it can be a case of trying a few if you have a friendly pharmacist. I know there is one brand of Tamoxifen that gives me much worse side effects, but other people on here find that brand suits them better.  Hope the Exemestane treats you better and that you get the hand back to normal quickly R",

      "Content": "Hi Islanikita  I'm back to offer you some words of encouragement. I am 48 - I was diagnosed in February but had 8 rounds of chemo so am only a few weeks ahead of you - actually my radiotherapy is due to start 5th December so you are catching up with me fast!! I feel exactly like you and thought the surgery was the worst to contemplate - I have really struggled with it - and I am finding it hard to recover from - so tired and stiff and in pain nearly 6 weeks later. I have to ask myself if it is partly psychological. I did not want to look like this, I did not want to feel like this - one thing that freaks me out is if I drink a cold drink and I can feel it all over that side of my chest!  Anyway - I have a really big problem with surgery so have decided against reconstruction (so far) my solution was to have a bilateral mastectomy so that I could be even. It was a bit of a struggle to get it approved but I didn't have it in the end - it is an option for the future. For weeks I wouldn't look at both breasts at the same time - went to great lengths including taping fabric over the flat one to wash! Anyway - now I am starting to feel a bit better about it - I am never going to love it but I think I can accept it. It is a constant reminder, you're right and that word deformed - yes that is how I feel too and wish the other one was smaller. But - we don't have cancer anymore. We made a sacrifice in order to survive. When I wanted a bilateral, I had to have a psychological assessment and it was the first time I thought anyone understood how I felt. I think that in a few weeks you will begin to feel better, but do consider some therapy or counselling if you don't - this is a hard road we're on!  When you start to sort out your reconstruction, as others have said - you can have surgery to both breasts so can reduce if that's what you want.  More practically - when I had a proper meltdown over buying bras - people recommended amoena. I had seen their bras but not been on their website - if you haven't been on it - have a look. They have loads of bras - some really pretty ones, practical ones - they even have matching sets!  I got 4 softies - 2 of the biggest and 2 small so I could sort out the sizing (I didn't have drains so have had fluid to deal with and a constantly changing size) Don't worry about the size of them - they seem to only come in 3 sizes. I do find that they look different depending on the style of bra I wear - I have one T shirt bra with a firm cup and that seems to disguise any difference in size or shape. I always used to wear an underwire so find the weight of my remaining breast is a problem in some bras. I initially told my BCN that I didn't want a silicone prosthesis - they feel heavy! But we had a discussion and I will give it a try. I was given a link for a knitted knocker by Kacang - (she's in Australia so is here at night but will hopefully respond - she has a very positive take on mastectomy) I am going to knit one - I told my BCN and she couldn't stop laughing - said she thought they could do a bit better than that - guess what she's getting for Christmas!! Of course your confidence has taken a bashing - you have been through so much! How is everything else? Hair, brows, nails? I don't recognise myself right now but I look on here and see people get over this and get on with their lives so we will too! It's a pep talk several times a day for me at the moment but we will get there. In truth, people are looking at us much less than we think - nobody is analysing your breasts, I'm sure. One thing I make a point of doing is telling people when I am admiring something about them - someone once wisely told me that we always think the worst when people look at us but they might actually be thinking you are wearing exactly the jumper they've been looking for. It's true! So put your softie in, look them in the eye and get your confidence back a little at a time. Bit of a long post - sorry. Here's some links - (if they work) http://www.amoena.com/uk-en/ you can request a knitted knocker here http://www.knittedknockersuk.com/ this is my previous post where everyone gave me bra advice community.macmillan.org.uk/.../924541 Hope you are feeling happier soon!

Some of us are finished treatment and stick around to give back the help and support we got. Hopefully that gives you reassurance that this is treatable and you will get through it. It is very early days for you and the worry is natural - I am sure there are all sorts of fears keeping you awake. For now, try to distract yourself - worry is exhausting. Talk as much as you need to - here if you are not comfortable talking to your nearest and dearest - it really does help. Having a treatment plan helps and then, starting treatment you will find that you just kind of put one foot in front of the other, one day-one step at a time until it is done. Of course you will worry about your husband and your children - it can be tough on our loved ones too, but you will look after each other and you can all get through this together. The helpline (0808 808 00 00 available Monday - Friday 9am - 8pm)  is a good place to talk too and your husband and children can also use it if they need to. There is an organisation called riprap that provides support specifically for teenagers with parents who have cancer - that might be useful to your children.       I finished treatment nearly a year ago and I found the forum by chance half way through chemo - it was the first time I had ever joined in anything like this and I am so glad I did - it has been invaluable to me. You will soon get the hang of it - there are some help topics here - but really, just shout if you are having any problems. Let us know how the oncology appointment goes on the 13th. R",

When I felt a lump it took me 2 months to go to my doctor for one reason and another - I don't think it was any bigger the day I had my tests than the day I first felt it - and with dense tissue and multiple benign cysts, I wouldn't have felt it when it was smaller. It's a scary time for you and difficult not to panic - it is standard to be seen within 2 weeks when you have any lump in your breast - sometimes you get an appointment sooner than that - my first experience of the breast clinic was 12 years ago - it turned out to be a cyst but my appointment that time came through in a few days! You will probably have a mammogram and ultrasound and core biopsy as you say. My hospital are pretty open and I 'knew' from the mammogram they thought it was cancer - the doctor doing the ultrasound checked if I had anyone with me before he said too much - I went to work afterwards in complete denial. I'm only telling you this because you might want to have someone supportive with you - maybe don't be as unprepared as me!!! I was also introduced to my breast care nurse that first day - yep still managed to stay in denial. I got my results 3 days later because that was when the results clinic is - same day each week.  Your hospital might do things differently, but rest assured, they do this all the time - they understand we are afraid, they will help to make the process easy no matter what it turns out to be. Breast cancer research is well funded and treatments improve all the time - as Crytaljuju says - success rates are high. I am slightly needle phobic - WAS slightly needle phobic - everyone is very tolerant of my little screams! I think they're used to it - I chat away like a mad thing to try to distract myself! You will cope! Good luck - keep posting here when your mind is in overdrive! R",

I was about to start chemo to shrink my lump when they told me there was a second tumour and I'd need a mastectomy - I then had 5 months to come to a decision though. I didn't have a reconstruction - once I met with the plastic surgeon and got the details, and got everyone's experiences on here, I decided it wasn't for me - I went back and forth with my surgeon over an elective bilateral mastectomy - I had the single in the end with a possibility of the other one if I choose next year. Do you know how soon they will operate and have you discussed your recon options? It might be better to have it at a later date than make a decision in a rush.  I'm sure you'll get some people with more helpful advice - there are definitely people who've had delayed reconstruction.

Hand on heart - if my team had told me to choose a treatment to do over - I'd pick chemo! The surgery and rads have been harder for me to recover from. That's not to say I had no side effects - but I was able to manage them and get on with life. Fair enough I was told I couldn't work because of the infection risk (I teach) so it might have been harder if I was working too. My chemo nurses were amazing - so honest and positive and the unit was a very upbeat place - lots of chatting, laughing etc. No-one can predict how you'll react but most side effects are manageable with the right drugs and my oncology team and nurses were adamant I shouldn't suffer at all - they were always willing to change my medication if something wasn't working.  Don't panic - take the drugs, get all the advice you can from the chemo club thread here, stick your positive head on and keep telling yourself it's a few months out of your life to buy you many more years!

To reassure you - I am 48, diagnosed in February - my original tumour was about 52mm (different measurements on different scans) I had a second tumour in the same breast 6mm - invasive ductal carcinoma both grade 2 with lymph node involvement. I took all the advice from my medical team and told them I was happy to have whatever treatment would give me the best outcome. They have told me several times that they want to throw everything they can at it to have the best possible chance of living as long as possible. They definitely aren't going to tell you it's too big. When I found mine, I was quite complacent as I have very lumpy breasts with lots of cysts (been to the breast clinic before) and waited a couple of months  before seeing the GP. I don't punish myself for that or for not finding it sooner - my consultant wasn't sure the first time he examined me.I did find it, I am  having treatment and the outlook is good. When you see your consultant, you will discuss your options and what is the best treatment for  your individual situation. There will be time for you to get some calm back and make your decisions - if you need time then a week here or there doesn't matter - that's what I was told a few times by my team. Remember, breast cancer is very common - they are very good at treating it and they have your best interests at heart! Wishing you some enjoyment tomorrow!! R",

Yes, it's very important to drink lots - it helps with the nausea, don't worry, the chemo drugs will stay in your system for a while - that's why people start to feel a bit better after one or two weeks. When I had an infection about a week after a chemo treatment, I was in a single room in A+E with a warning on the door that I was \"cytotoxic\" and all staff had to wear gloves and apron before entering the room to safeguard themselves - it was still in my system then. You're very well prepared! Have you taken a look at the breast cancer chemo club thread? It's a great place to connect with others going through treatment and the first page has a link to some ideas of what to take etc. Sounds like you've pretty much got it covered though! We'll all be thinking of you! R",

      "Content": "Hi ask123 I hope you are finding the site and the group helpful. I was diagnosed and treated in 2016 and found it a massive help. As you can see from the replies, we are all different and we all approach things differently. I was a bit \"out with it\" with my diagnosis - I went to work straight after my biopsy and told everyone, then the day after results told everyone at  2 different workplaces. People probably wish I would shut up about it but it was my way of dealing with it.  I feel that it is up to the individual to choose who and how to tell - I think that other people just have to be considerate enough to understand that. A friend of mine had breast cancer a few years ago and didn't speak to anyone until her treatment was over - her husband sent a group email on her behalf and asked us not to contact her. We were all OK with that because it was how she wanted to handle it. I know family are more difficult because they are closer to you but you already have to cope with a lot so sometimes it can seem like another burden to have to tell your loved ones and then console them. Would it be feasible to ask your sister to tell your parents and your other sister? It might be easier for them if they are told in person? People are very odd sometimes, but your sister may not have been making light of the situation - she might have been trying to convince herself that it was all OK. There is some information on talking about cancer on the site - here is a link to a page that is advice for others about talking to people with cancer. Perhaps you could email it to your sister - hmmm maybe not, depends on your relationship. You might find it helpful to look around that section anyway - to see that you are not alone feeling as you do. There is also information there on talking to children about cancer if that is something that might be helpful for you. At the moment, you are at the worst stage - constant appointments and results and, as you say, the picture getting larger each time because they do like to drip feed us information! As time goes on, it does get easier and hard as it may be to believe now, there will be a day when you look back and think \"wow - did all that really just happen to me?\" and you will be glad it's over and you will move on. However, you have to walk that treatment path first and none of us would tell you it's a breeze, but you will cope - one day at a time. Feel free to rant as much as you need - that's what we are here for! R",

      "Content": "Hi Suzeanna Sorry to hear you've had a recurrence - but good that your mammogram picked it up.  Now, I am not a great believer in luck - let's assume you are no more lucky or unlucky than anyone else. Firstly, of course you've read horror stories - if you saw the title \"successful uneventful treatment\" you wouldn't have read it - we all go looking for the worst case scenario and are seldom disappointed. Hopefully, you will get lots of reassurance here. I don't think you're questioning that the nodes have to go - if you can't have other treatments then it's the best thing so we need to give you some positive stories to encourage you. I wanted to respond because I had my node clearance in October and I AM having some problems! I don't have full mobility (yet) I have some nerve damage and am getting some physio treatment to sort it out. It's uncomfortable, sometimes painful and I can't really return to work until it improves. If I was told I needed nodes removed on the other side, I wouldn't hesitate - I'd have it done again!! I am sure I will get full movement back in time - it doesn't impact on my daily life and the pain is not constant it happens in certain positions. The important thing is - I've been told it's very unusual. I have a result that hardly ever happens - and it's still not that bad. There is always the risk of lymphoedema, but these days that risk is fairly small and if you follow advice you are more likely to avoid it. It can also be managed effectively if it does happen. Please don't panic - it is a good thing that you are informed of all possibilities, however unlikely. As other people respond you will begin to see that this is a fairly common and routine procedure that very seldom causes problems! Hopefully we can all give you the reassurance you need! R",

      "Content": "|Hi LizzieD58 and Googieswife  I thought I would pitch in as someone else who fared pretty well through chemo - it's true - those who are off and getting on with life as usual don't normally post. I carried on running through at least half of my chemo - went to some parties, lunches with friends etc etc. It's not exactly a breeze but for the majority of people who are in good health, it is very do-able. It made me tired towards the end, but most of the time it was fine. At my hospital, the chemo introduction was done in the chemo unit so it reassured me no end to see what an upbeat and friendly place it was - not the room full of frail, suffering people I had imagined. We have a breast cancer chemo club thread which you might to look at - a new thread starts each month - here is the March one. The first page has some information about good things to take etc. and then everyone going through chemo can post tips, ask for advice and just generally connect with each other. As for diabetes - I don't really know anything about it but I am going to tag Kacang who may be able to help. She is in Australia so procedures may be different, but I know we have had members with diabetes in the past and there have been quite a few discussions about it here. I know it can be difficult to ask questions - please don't feel that any of them are stupid though - this stuff is new to us all when we start so we need to be told everything and also, it is an emotionally difficult thing to have to deal with - there are no stupid questions. Goodness, if there was a prize for stupid questions, I would definitely have been in the finalists when I was having treatment - \"I don't understand\" was almost my catchphrase. I was always treated with the utmost respect and understanding. If you really can't face asking questions, how about seeing if there is a way you could email them? You'd get a bit more time to think about them then. Or even just write them down - then you can work through the list verbally or hand it over and let them answer them. One final thing - you don't have to do it if you don't want to. I turned up to my first chemo and told them I'd changed my mind (my diagnosis had changed the day before) They were brilliant - took me to a quiet corner, chatted to me, called an oncologist who spoke to me then went to see my surgeon and came back with some answers. I didn't have it that day but agreed to go back a couple of days later. I'm not remotely suggesting that you should do that, but knowing that you have a choice and are in control might help you to feel better about starting it.  I wish both of you well through it - we are all here to help you through - you can do it!

      "Content": "Hi BevL My hair is only just starting to regrow - still one more chemo to go - so I am not speaking from experience, but I have been a hairdresser for 30 years Cutting your hair will never encourage it to grow thicker or stimulate the growth - it grows very deep within the skin and the cells are long dead by the time you see them. BUT ... sometimes it will look thicker because the hairs will be naturally at different lengths and cutting them short will make them the same length so they look thicker because you see them all (hope that makes some sort of sense) I think the advice to cut it is because it grows fine and a bit \"messy\" at first. Our amazing bodies will always divert nutrients from our hair (and skin and nails) when we are ill, to where we need it most, so it makes sense that what you first see will not be strong, healthy hair - that will come later. You could keep cutting your hair and as it grows it will gradually look more healthy - or you could leave it and see what it looks like - it won't make any difference to how it eventually grows. Also everyone is different - some people will have the hair they know almost immediately, for other people it can take a year or more to get back to their pre-cancer hair - but it will get there. Just to let you know, I have recently cut the top of mine - it's really thin and wispy there but looks thicker and nicer at the back and sides so I've left them. I'll leave it to grow when I like the look of it! My advice would be to do what feels right for you - it is all about how we feel about how we look!  Enjoy - I think it's such an important positive step! R",

      "Content": "Hi dillybub I was told by my chemo nurses not to colour for 6 months after chemo - they said that it was a precaution because the hair follicles were open. As a hairdresser, I would translate this as meaning your scalp will be more sensitive and you could have a skin reaction to the colour. Certainly I would proceed cautiously with anyone post chemo - even with the huge amount I have learned going through this - I still know nothing!!  Ultimately, I would never advise anyone to disregard medical advice. If your hair has been growing since March does that mean you are nearing 6 months post chemo? Highlights can be done so as to be nowhere near your scalp, and there are other products that can be used (most permanent and \"semi\" permanent hair colours contain ingredients which are known irritants and allergens)  There is also a possibility that the colour won't give the same result as usual - hormones, drugs, different health conditions all have an effect on the hair. If you have a regular hairdresser that you trust - speak to them. Chances are you are not their first client to have gone through cancer treatment. They will know you and be able to suggest alternatives if they are not happy to colour it - don't leave it too close to the wedding though in case you decide to get used to a new look. Finally, I will tell you my philosophy as someone who makes a living changing the way people look: Everyone in this world is beautiful as they are, changing that is helping to create a version of beautiful that is different but not better or worse. I bet your grey curls look fantastic, even though they are not what you are used to! Good luck with achieving the hair that you want and wishing you the most enjoyable time at your son's wedding - what a wonderful thing to look forward to! R",

I can well imagine how shocked you are and, I am sure your minds are racing - full of questions. Firstly, please know that breast cancer is very treatable. I had grade 2 breast cancer in 2016 - it spread to at least 3 lymph nodes. I also had mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and am here to tell you that we get through and we pick up our lives again. Success rates for treatment are really high and we have women here who finished treatment years ago. Try to stay away from the darker places on the internet - stick to reputable sites - Macmillan, of course, Breast Cancer Care and Cancer Research UK. I am sure your sister is in shock and she will likely be guided through this step by step by her medical team. If she feels like it, she is more than welcome to join us too. I see that Dreamthief has already replied to your post in Family and Friends but I wanted to say Hi here too and say that you are more than welcome to use as many groups on here that you feel are appropriate, so please don't apologise - you didn't post incorrectly at all - we are just all so eager to help and get you the most appropriate support possible. You may have seen the helpline number 0808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday 9am to 8pm) it is for anyone affected by cancer so you are welcome to call if you need to talk, as is your sister and the rest of your family. My daughter called when I was having treatment and felt so much better afterwards. We've got you now and we will give you as much support as you need, whenever you need it - there's usually people around at all sorts of hours. Best wishes to your sister and all of you R",

My surgeon was really not in favour of draining it - he said every time they put a needle in it, there's an infection risk so he doesn't like to do it. He advised compression - I wore a sports bra every day. To be honest, it didn't seem to help much, but I got rather ill soon after so maybe it would have if I'd continued with it - I did it for about a month. it is the pain that is difficult to handle, so I think they would drain them to ease that for you. It's not an easy road is it? Unfortunately they can take a long time to get rid of, but why don't you sit down and have a chat either with your surgeon or BCN about the best way to approach this. I think different hospitals - or even different surgeons - have different opinions so it's good to talk it through. Wishing you some ease from it! R",

      "Content": "Hi I just thought I'd throw a couple of things into the mix. My SNB showed 3 out of 3 nodes affected and my surgeon advised clearance. He's fairly young for a consultant so not exactly old-fashioned, but maybe a bit 'belt and braces' He was adamant he thought it was the best option. I had the clearance and radiotherapy - they only found one more node that showed evidence of cancer but that reassured me and I felt I had a good picture of the situation. Without the clearance I am the sort of person who would worry about how far the cancer had gone. I have had nerve damage that has taken time to repair and numbness and am left with a small dog ear which irritates my arm. I still don't regret the clearance but that is related to the type of person I am and for some people, avoiding clearance makes sense and I am sure will become the norm - just as WLE is now preferred to mastectomy. Radiotherapy isn't without problems - it hardens tissues which can take at least a year to then soften and stretch out.  SNB and rads do also carry a small risk of lymphoedema though not as much as clearance, true. I fear lymphoedema but my surgeon told me current thinking is it affects about 20% of women. Some of those will be people who don't follow the advice on avoiding it. Having clearance won't stop your lymph system working - it just means the normal pathway won't be there but you should be shown a drainage massage to re-direct it to the nodes in your neck and your other armpit. It's really a question of what you will be happiest living with - we can't predict what physical side effects we will get, so it might be easier to make the decision that will be best for you psychologically.

I found the silicone prosthesis too heavy. Although it's not really heavy and doesn't weigh as much as the tissue that was removed, - the weight is all on the bra strap so it made my shoulders too sore. Maybe I should have persevered but at that time, I really felt I'd been through enough and gave up on it. - I keep it in a drawer for \"best\" but have no idea what that would be!!!! Anyway - One thing I have learnt is that I was wearing my bras too big/loose around the band. I had a bra fitting before my mastectomy and the lovely woman told me that the band should be tighter to reduce the strain on the straps and pressure on the shoulders. I still sometimes wear a bra slightly too big because I struggle to find the right size (small band, larger cup) and I find that in the looser bras, the knitted knockers ride up more. I'd totally agree with going to an event and getting some info from the professionals, but in the meantime, it might be a short-term solution to go for a bra fitting and check you are wearing the right size bra - maybe you already have. I also think the style of bra helps - have you tried shopping around for different styles? I think it is a real process to get it right and I hope you find a solution soon! R",

      "Content": "Hi Lizzy4u I agree with the others that it's worth switching brands if you haven't already tried that. But I also wanted to say that I was very stiff with a lot of joint pain and quite bad peripheral neuropathy after chemo. My oncologist warned me it could take up to 2 years for that to stop. The PN has more or less gone and now the joint pain is only there after long periods of being still. It's just over a year since my last chemo. I do think exercise helped me - not a lot yet but some gentle running and walking every day and some strength training. For me - movement seems to be key - the more time I spend in any position - sitting at a desk, standing on a train etc then the more it will ache. A six hour drive a couple of months ago left me really stiff for a couple of days. So - you can try coming off it, try different brands, try an alternative - hopefully you will be able to find a solution that works for you. R",

I still have quite a bit of peripheral neuropathy numbness in my hands and feet and last night had a really bad itch on one foot - but if I scratch it, I can't feel it so it doesn't help. It kept me awake for ages - I tried mind over matter but that didn't work. Does anyone have any experience or ideas? I know it's a little thing but I long for a decent night's sleep and it seems to be getting less and less likely. Thanks R",

      "Content": "Hi WORRIED2016 Here is a link to the FAQ page of the R1/R2 website - it's explained there better than on the leaflet in the box. Basically the R2 is 4 times a day, most importantly at bedtime. The R1 is for immediately after treatment but needs to air dry for 20 minutes so that can be tricky - it gets very sticky as it dries so if you dress while it's wet, your clothes will stick to it and it's a bit unpleasant peeling them off! (tried it) It can be applied up to 4 hours after treatment, though - but before R2. There - clear as mud? But yes - don't put cream on skin before treatment - when I had pm appointments I used to put the R2 on in the morning but shower before I left for the hospital. www.radiotherapytreatment.com/.../ Hope it all goes well!

Still one more chemo to go but they have shrunk a lot and wondering if it's worth discussing with my consultant - Perhaps it is to do with breast size or something. Thanks R",

She avoided saying cancer and called it an illness so as not to worry her. She's figured it out for herself though! Its not remotely the same as when it's your own children, but just wanted to say she is relentlessy curious about it and it is refreshingly easy to talk to her - she will always tell me how it is -  \" your hair is not as important as your life is it - the medicine makes you better\" - stuff like that!  I am sure you will find the best way for your family - and as everyone else has told you - it is do-able - you will suprise yourself!

      "Content": "Hi Matohu First a congratulations on finishing treatment - woo hoo! You've already been given great advice - I thought I'd add a little more. You could look at attending a moving forward or next steps event. Lots of hospitals offer them and so do Maggies centres and Breast Cancer Care. The haven also offer some therapies including counselling. You could check your hospital website or the In Your Area section of this website. I found out I could access acupuncture, hormone clinics, yoga, mindfulness, physical rehabilitation - lots of things. I have also fairly recently read a book called The Cancer Survivors Companion. There are a few similar ones - I liked this one because it also deals with how those close to you might be feeling and has advice for them as well. I found it really helpful dealing with all the other repercussions from cancer that I hadn't thought about - self-esteem, confidence in my abilities at work etc etc There is a lot of support out there, but I do think you need to work quite hard to find it sometimes and find what is right for you. I never joined any support groups, but I do volunteer now and I find it really helps to talk to other people who have been through it - just knowing that you aren't going to be upsetting anyone by talking about cancer is a massive relief. Do have a look at what is available - the recovery is as much a part of the process as the treatment. R",
