      "Content": "Diagnosed stage 2 cancer, had lump and Lymph node  removed, went for CT SCAN today  and told I need a boost at end of 3 weeks radiotherapy, been positive up to now but tonight am feeling down at that news.   Before  Op was told 5 weeks radiotherapy, after Op told 3 weeks, thought, happy Days, lucky escape compared to some people. Been so positive through the whole thing.  I know I have got off lightly but it has knocked the wind out of my sail. ",
