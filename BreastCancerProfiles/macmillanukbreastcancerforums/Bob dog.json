    "Content": "I have a portocath (fitted in Dec). It is clearly visible under the skin and did seem to rise in the first few weeks after. It's generall uncomfortable but not painful and it aches when I feel tired. Hopefully yours will settle down soon.  I know it's not a great feeling but it is necessary. I just dream about how good I'll feel when they take it out! I'm halfway through now ",
