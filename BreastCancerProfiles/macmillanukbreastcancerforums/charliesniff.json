    "Content": "jowoomot I'm also in the middle of deciding what to do but have ruled out the LD flap - the surgeon asked why I didn't want that , I explained why (all points raised above) and he then said it wouldn't be suitable anyway as I didn't have enough tissue etc there to make a breast , so I would also need some tissue from somewhere else (so three scars !) so why he had suggested it I'm not sure.  I have been offered the DIEP but at this moment am so fed up with hospitals and things going wrong that I am (today at least!) thinking of an implant - the surgeon has said he will lift my other boob at a later date too so the match better.  Such a difficult decision , I would rather there was no decision to make. Jo x Hi Jo, I had a double mastectomy with an immediate diep reconstruction and have been very pleased with the results. That was late October 2016 and all the scars are soft and healing well. I am now going through chemo with radio to follow. A year after that the surgeons will do the final tweeks to my breasts. I am really happy with my choice its all my body, symmetrical boobs and a tummy tuck. A good result from from having cancer. Hope this helps Nicky",
