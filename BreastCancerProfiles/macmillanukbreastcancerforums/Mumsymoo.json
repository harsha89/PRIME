      "Content": "Dreamthief Hi Mumsymoo  If you are ER+ positive this means your own oestrogen is feeding the cancer cells and is usually scored from 1 to 8 like ER+6 The higher the number the more effective the tablets mentioned below will have on it. Post menopause the most common treatment is daily tablets called AI's or aromatse inhibitors. Although being post meno your ovaries no longer make oestrogen (ER is estrogen from the american spelling) some istill produced by the adrenal glands and from your own body fat cells so these tablets halt that process. There are around 3 common types of AI's - Letrozole, Anastrozole and Exemestane (the latter one being steroidal based) Pre menopause the tablets are more commonly Tamoxifen but in some cases these can be given post menopause instead. Confusing eh ?      You can find further information about this from this link Hormonal Therapies for Breast Cancer. Have you already had surgery this time around and are they offering you different chemo, or have you dodged that this time ? Welcome to the Mac Community by the way Take care, G n' J Thank you so much for your response. I was told it was a solitary tumour ER positive. The tumour has been removed with random sampling of the lymph nodes. I learn more next week.",
