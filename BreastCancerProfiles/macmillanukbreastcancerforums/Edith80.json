    "Content": "Hi, I too used Nicolajane - lovely swimsuit, has worn well. I'm 43, flattering and not frumpy. Had a 'swim boob' from my breast care nurse, lovely satin bag and waterproof bag for the changing rooms. Swim boob has ridges/grooves at the back to let water drain. Weighted better than my knitted knocker.  Hope this helps  Have a lovely time xxxx",
