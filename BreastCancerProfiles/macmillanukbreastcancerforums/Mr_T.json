      "Content": "Hi all, I just joined today.  My wife will have the first TC in a couple of weeks and I was wondering how should I prepare to make her life as easy and enjoyable as possible during treatment.  I have gather a few good ideas here (thanks to all!).  Somewhere I read that icecream was not appropriate but it seems that it works for some people?  Would it make sense to bring an ipad, book, movies or so to the sessions? (I or a friend will be with here always). What is the best thing a husband can do to help going through the process?  Mr_T  ",
