      "Content": "Hi Kat Fabulous news that your sentinel node biopsy was all negative, mine were too back in May 2015. Have you got a treatment plan from your surgeon and BCN? If not, I would ring them and ask what next I had 15 radiotherapy sessions & 5 booster sessions & tamoxifen (ER positive cancer), but treatments vary according to your tumour results Best wishes Denise",

      "Content": "Hello ladies,  I had wide local excision & SNB last May followed by radiotherapy & tamoxifen. All was well until a few days ago when I started having discomfort/pain in my breast around the surgery site and up into my armpit. It doesn't feel \"right\" and looks \"odd\" too, but more dimpled than previously. I don't know if I'm just being soft, I'm not usually, but wondered if any of you lovely people have experienced this? Thanks Denise x",

      "Content": "Hi Jo, what a horrendous time you're having. I've been extremely fortunate not to have ever required grafting of any sort, but I used to work in theatres, so I do understand the \"mechanics\" of it all.  If you're allergic to the adhesive in most dressings & potentially the sutures too, it may well be in your best interest to continue with the packing method of healing. I'd be inclined to see what the suture allergy testing shows & make your decision along with your oncoplastic consultant then. Hope you get it sorted really soon x ",
