      "Content": "I had a mastectomy 2 weeks ago and implant fitted , grade 2 cancer size 15mm . I thought I was over the worst and about to get back on with my life but after seeing the consultant on Wednesday was told the MRI didn't show another lump which was 45mm and there was cancer in the first lymph node that had been removed ,i have lobular cancer but thought the MRI would be able to detect all the cancer just wondering if any one else has had this happen as I now feel I am back to square one. I am having a lymph clearance on Thursday followed by a ct scan and bone scan and will need radiotherapy and maybe chemo, my main concern is will the radiotherapy after the implant because I am very pleased with the result .",
