    "Content": "I was diagnosed with TNBC December of 2014. 1 Dr staged it at 2 and another at 3.Chemotheropy began almost immediately. 18 weeks. 1 every Tuesday. Each session lasted 5 too 7 hours.  It took much longer than 18 weeks because I had to stop several times. Complications! Then I  had a bilateral mastectomy and skin expanders were placed for reconstruction. Then I started  26 radiation treatments. I was told that I am in remission. I have not been myself since.  I am tired. My fingers and toes contort without warning and is very painful.  My teeth are breaking off. I am off balance  and confused easily. My memory is very bad. Is anyone else having these problems? One question I can't get ananswer too is, Has my lifespan been shortened due to the aggressive treatment. Also what does remmisoin really meen?  If anyone has any input please do.  Thanks to all",
