    "Content": "Hi All,  I was diagnosed March 2016 I  had a lumpectomy, chemo x 4, and 15 radiotherapy sessions, have my first mammogram this friday - so fingers crossed - I was initially put on Anastrazole in August 2016 and boy did that cause me some severe SE's, the joint and muscle pain was horrendous, in November, after seeing my lovely Oncologist she immediately changed me to Letrozole - which I've been advised I am on for 10 years. The pain in the joints and muscles has reduced considerably although I suffer if I walk for a distance and I do get tired very easily. The sweats are my main concern, I don't notice these very much in the day but at night - particularly when in bed they are pretty bad. Up until 10 minutes ago I didn't know about different brands and the different effects these can cause people, I am currently on TEVA and wondering if I take my tablet at night instead of in the morning would this make any difference to the sweating at night? Any help would be appreciated. Many thanks Liz xx",
