      "Content": "Hello all, never expected to be here. I was diagnosed with invasive lobular breast cancer S2 end of January and am now almost 3 weeks from mastectomy and after meeting with my consultant told I\u2019ll be having chemotherapy starting soon. I as yet don\u2019t know what or when. I feel rather lost and anxious and thought reaching out to anyone in my situation might be help. Anyone going through the same? ",

      "Content": "Hi there.  I really feel for you, it\u2019s such a rollercoaster isn\u2019t it, some days I can barely get my thoughts together but day by day we get there. Im healing really well and I found that physio has really helped me to get my strength and movement back. I remember in the early days post surgery feeling so uncomfortable and weak but all doing well so keep going. Having met with my oncologist and going through my case I start a course of 6 rounds of FEC-T chemo tomorrow! Yikes! None of this really seems real but you will find a strength and courage you never knew you had, reach out to friends and family and be totally open with you feelings, it\u2019s all ok. I take each day as it comes now and although I\u2019m anxious about my treatment I know how many other strong women like us keep going and support each other. Feel free to message me for any support I can give you, or just a listening ear. keep on keeping on. We got this, sending love and positivity.",

      "Content": "Hi Granny59 , thank you so much for your reply. I\u2019m healing very well and keeping up my physio which really does make a difference. Isn\u2019t the waiting hard, I try n focus on being creative, art knitting and reading to quiet my mind and keep me busy, thank goodness for being left handed!  I will definitely check out that link! I hope that you are keeping well this weekend and thank you, it took me long enough to work out how to post here! It\u2019s good to know there\u2019s a community here! ",
