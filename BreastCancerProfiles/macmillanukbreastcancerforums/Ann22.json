    "Content": "Hi Jamesy, I am a Manager in a School and I know we are currently recruiting for a Manager at another School in our contract. If you inbox me the details of the job you're looking at, I'll let you know if it's the same post. If it is, I can guarantee that if you have the required qualifications, you will get a fair unbiased interview, as my boss has been unbelievably fair with me over my diagnosis and treatment. You should also be aware, that cancer is covered by the Disability Discimination Act, now known as the Equality Act since 2010, which means that no prospective employer can refuse you an interview on the grounds of having cancer or being treated for cancer. Hope this helps, Regards, Ann",
