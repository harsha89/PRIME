      "Content": "Thanks for replying.  Glad your feeling better now. I think what you said about not wanting people to feel sorry for you is exactly how I feel. I just don\u2019t want to be that person in the head scarf who people look at and then discuss once I\u2019ve gone. But I suppose I have no choice now. i know I\u2019m still in shock and it will pass, just feel like u said too like when will I be back to myself, and keep thinking why is it happening to me like what\u2019s caused it ",

I have 2 children, and I feel like I\u2019m not going to be able to look after them, don\u2019t want them to see me unwell and with no hair.  Don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m coping well at all atm",

Ha my diagnosis was stage 1 triple negative cancer.  i had an mri and ct scan today which both came back clear! Was such a relief and I feel sooo much better now I know it\u2019s not spread anywhere else.  Going for chemo first now too so no surgery tmw. Have a meeting with oncologist fri to find out the details.  The hair situation is still what\u2019s giving me the most anxiety but I\u2019m trying my best to get over it.  Thanks you all again x ",
