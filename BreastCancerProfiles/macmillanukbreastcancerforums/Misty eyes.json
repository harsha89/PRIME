    "Content": "I was diagnosed with estrogen-positive breast cancer a few years ago and am aware of the fact that I should not consume soya products, as they are phytoestrogens and mimic estrogen. But, now that I'm scrutinising food ingedient labels more than ever before, I am dismayed to find that a large proportion of products contain some soya! I was told to reduce my cholesterol and change to one of those cholesterol-reducing breadspreads, only to find that they all seem to contain a soya product. So I'm sticking to good natural butter. Is anyone else concerned about this?",
