      "Content": "Hi Eni, Sorry you're here but welcome to the site.  I was diagnosed  on the 28th June (4 weeks tomorrow), and still have not had my lumpectomy.  I had a slight complication in that they found some anomalies on my MRI so have had further ultrasound on the other boob.  Was then booked for op but cancelled the day before due to other concerns.  They saw a 'strand' on the affected side, originaly they weren't concerned but then decided they needed a contrast mammogram (yesterday) to get a better look at it and have now decided it is part of the tumour.  Now waiting for an op date. Some ladies on here and other BC forums have been on holiday between diagnosis and op so it seems it is not unusual for there to be a 4-6 week wait for op, although some do go sooner. You didn't mention what grade they think it is or your ER/PR/HER2 status.  Have you been told these yet?  Did you have a biopsy? Try not to worry too much.  If you have a Macmillan centre of Breast Cancer group near you, you could get in touch and go join them.  I went to my local Macmillan centre last week and it was really lovely.  Am going to a free yoga session they offer on Thursday and they do regular coffee mornings and afternoon teas. If you can get out and about and do stuff you'll feel better.  One of my friends is taking me out to lunch today and I've been for a couple of walks.  If you haven't told friends try and choose a few who you think will be a good help and support for you and hopefully after their initial shock and upset they will be there for you. All the best and good luck for your op Michele xxx",

      "Content": "Hi Amanda, I'm a nurse myself and have seen ops and had ops so am fairly well versed in what goes on.  Every hospital is slightly different.  Some wards are close to the theatres some are a good walk away. You will be given a gown that does up at the back.  If you are walking to theatre then they will normally give you another gown to wear like a dressing gown over the top of the other one.  You can always take your own with you so you can be reassured that you have one.  If you are going on a trolley you will be covered with a blanket.  You usually get to keep your own knickers on but some hospitals will give you the wonderfully fashionable paper ones.  You won't be able to keep your bra on.  As many of the ladies have said, they usually ask you to slip either one or both of your arms out of the gown but they will continue to keep you covered.  They may attach sticky pads and/or leads (with which to monitor your heart rate), to your chest before you go off to sleep, or they may do this after you are asleep. Theatre staff are usually very considerate of their patients dignity so try not to worry.  Obviously some part of the affected boob is going to be exposed during the operation ...... it has to be for them to see what they are doing. I've had alot of gynaecological surgery (several cameras up my hoohaa), lol, and that is pretty undignified to be honest.  I get the joy of walking round the hospital nodding hello to Doctors and Nurses on a daily basis, who've seen my hoohaa .  My breast surgeons regularly come on to my ward, so now I get the added joy of knowing that the half of the hospital that hasn't seen my downstairs area, have instead seen one or both of my boobs, lmao. Just keep in mind this surgery will save your life!!!!!!! And that is what is important!!!!!! And also, remember they've seen thousands of bodies of all shapes and sizes. Michele",

      "Content": "Afternoon Everyone, Just need to  have a little whinge. Was due to have my WLE & SNB today but had a phone call yesterday afternoon canceling it.  I had my MRI on the 10th of July which showed the BC in the right breast was aprox 10mm (yay, small), and 2 abnormalities on the left breast (boo).  Had to go back for another ultasound on the left breast on the 12th, which showed one of the abnormalities was a cyst and the other, being so small they where unable to find it and believe it is artifact on the MRI.  Radiologist read me the results of the MRI which mentioned strands or stranding but said he wasn't concerned.  Op booked for the 20th.  Breast clinic appointment on the 18th where the surgeon briefly discussed the stranding and said they would need to take that area too but would discuss it at the Wednesday MDT.  Phone call yesterday afternoon from surgeon to say after discussion at the MDT they feel they need to do a contrast mammogram to see this stranding better.  They don't want to take more tissue than is absolutely necessary, but they want to minimise the risk of a 2nd op ........ all of which I understand and I'm happy they are being so thorough but blimey, I just want it done now! So, phone call today to say contrast mammogram booked for Monday.  I then get a phone call from BCN saying she's sorry about the delay, do I have any questions ...... I ask will I be listed for next Thursday?  Yes, IF the results are back, but they might have to send the images to the UK which will take longer!  So I might have to wait a few more weeks :( It's a bit frustrating!  As all my shifts at work were covered from today, so I've decided not to go back to work.  I would have been due to work Sun, Mon, Tues nights anyway so would not have been able to work Mon night if I'm up all day in mammography department.  Just hope they can do op next Thursday as I feel bad about the whole work situation.  I'm going to feel even worse if they don't do it next Thursday as that will mean another week off or go back to work and then have to mess them around if I then have to go off to appointments ......... arghhhhhhhh. Sorry ladies, just needed a vent.  What will be will be, I guess. Michele xxx",

      "Content": "Hi London, Misty and Jo, Thanks for your replies.  Have been feeling a bit quiet since my post.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not feeling down or negative, just a bit subdued, lol.  But hey ho, contrast mammo done yesterday and the radiologist  told me the result straight away.  He believes the 'strand' is involved and will need removing, it's 30mm long (don't know how wide, am assuming a mm or 2) so it's bigger than the original tumour which is only 10mm. So now waiting for a phone call (fingers crossed) to give me op date, which will be soon hopefully (toes crossed).  The girls at work have been great and encouraged me to go off sick, they seem to be of the opinion that I was mad to go in after my diagnosis and say they wouldn't have so I feel a bit better about that.  I'm having terrible acid reflux at the moment, had the odd mild bout before but nothing like this.  Don't feel particularly stressed or anxious but it's obviously affecting me more than I realise ...... off to the chemist to get something for it.  Any suggestions? As ever, thanks for the support ladies, you are fantastic xxx Lots of love Michele xxx",
