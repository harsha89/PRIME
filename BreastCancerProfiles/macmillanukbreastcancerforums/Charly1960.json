      "Content": "After a successful 'lumpectomy' my wife has been on Tamoxifen for 2 years which has been bad enough! She has recently been put on Aromasin. She has continual temperature changes, is virtually unable to sleep and seems to have changed personality. This on the face of it seems a ridiculous statement. However, we have been together a very long time & I know her very well. She seems to have become, hard & distant which is so unlike her. She also seems to have got very forgetful. Now I guess this could all be due to the lack of sleep, but it's all come on since the Aromasin. Has anyone heard of this or have I finally cracked under the strain?",

I got the impression that there was not much option in the medications, but given what you say, I'll see if I can persuade my Mrs to give the doctors a good grilling. I feel a bit selfish about the whole thing, as it's her that's doing the suffering, but I'm pretty much at my wits end myself. Many thanks to you both.",
