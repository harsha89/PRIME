    "Content": "gmc.co.uk has a search function for medical practitioners which I used to find my surgeon by name BUT 1) it will only tell you where they studied and the dates they were added to the register 2) when I tried to check the link just now, that bit wasn't working When it is working again, you should be able to find them and also will see what their speciality is Asking PALS is good advice,or the hospital might have the info on their own website if they have one. Failing all that, ask them directly; I'm sure you do have a right to know.  My own operation (vulva, not breast) was done by a Plastics (cosmetic) surgeon but I believe any surgeon *could* do the initial operation and further treatment depends on the results of tests run on removed tissue as well as the best cosmetic result.  Please note this is my opinion only and I have no medical training. I do hope everything turns out well for you Jean ",
