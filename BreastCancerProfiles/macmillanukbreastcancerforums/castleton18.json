A TRAM HOWEVER IS A SURGICAL CUT FROM HIP TO HIP AND ONLY FAT AND SKIN ARE MOVED ,THEY ARE TOTALLY DISCONECTED FROM THE BODY AND THEN REPLUMMED IN UNDER THE ARM TO A BLOOD VESSEL.THIS OP IS ABOUT 10 - 12 HRS LONG AND THE RECOVERY FROM WHAT I NO IS ABOUT 4 -5 MONTHS..i NO THIS TO BE FACT AS I HAVE EXPLORED EVERY AVENUE OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DECIDED ON THE TRAM WHICH I WILL BE HAVING ON 22ND JAN .HOPE THIS HELPS SHAZ  ",

      "Content": "I had grade 2 oestergeon sensitive bc in april 2013 had mx and radiotherapy. We nt back to work in jan 2014 I had a tram reconstruction all went welluntil, I got an infection and spent a week in the hospital. I was then told they had done a biopsy on my breast whilst in theatre doing the recon and it showed more cancerous cells.I now have to face chemotherapy in a couple of weeks also once my wound has healed. I had cellulitus and it ate away at the soft tissue in my breast and caused me to loose volume in my boob so after my chemo I have to have fat injections also to boost it back up again.I was told of my reoccurrence in jan and I to wont start chemo til the end of the month but they did do bone and ct scans to check if it had travelled. Might be an idea if you have not already had them to ask your oncologist for them before you start treatment to at least give you peace of mind.Not sure were you are in the country I am in Derbyshire.   Regards Sharon  ",
