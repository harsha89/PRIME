    "Content": "I would concur with the other responses. Once the 'installation' is over, bordering on minor surgery, its very convenient. Nurses like it too: you can see the relief when they know. And saves on the dreaded canula being installed each time you visit. Does depend on how many treatments you have. I was having something every day (when I could remember), so was very useful. You'll have a bandage to keep it in place. Swimming's probably not going to happen. Still miss a bit, even though I have very few infusions these days. Recommended. Aaron  ",
