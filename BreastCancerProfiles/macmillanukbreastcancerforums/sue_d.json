      "Content": "Thank you so much madhatter for your post. Since being diagnosed I see and hear about cancer everywhere...it's right in your face, on the TV, radio, newspapers, mags, everyone knows someone who's had it, who has it! You are right my head had been going round & round, over thinking everything. My emotions have been completely out of control. One minute I'm ok & I know I can do it, I have everyone around me for support, then next minute it comes over me like a huge waive of distress and despair.  It is so draining. I am sleeping because my GP prescribed tablets so that helps me through the day. My next big hurdle is Tuesday when I get results of CT scan and treatment plan. I'm trying not to think about it but it is a constant mental battle.  Since joining this group all I seem to do is moan and groan and I know there are so many more people out there going through far worse than me. Right now all I can do is pray for strength for us all......... xxxxxx",

The doc game me pills so that I sleep but as soon as I wake up I think oh my god I'm so scared now of getting CT results in case it has spread....the anxiety is overwhelming! I know I've got to stop these thought patterns....but how?????",

      "Content": "Thank you so much again for the responses to my post. The pills from my GP at least are letting me sleep which is helping.  Last Sunday I went to church for the first time in over 10 years. I prayed & I cried but it was comforting. I've been back several times....it's a peaceful place, a place to gather your thoughts and focus your mind. i had a moment first thing Christmas Day but after that I got on with the day and actually managed to eat a lovely dinner cooked by my wonderful partner.  I am so thankful I have family and friends around me.  I really want to send all good wishes to everyone today. Big hugs xxxxx  ",
