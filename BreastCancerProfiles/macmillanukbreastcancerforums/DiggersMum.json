      "Content": "Hello everyone, I've not posted for a while but I'm looking for advice. Had 3 x FEC cycles and coped pretty well then the first docetaxel put me in hospital for nine days with Neutropenic Sepsis (neutrophils down to 0.1). Oncologist decided to change me to weekly paclitaxel to prevent recurrence but that caused anaphylactic shock with only 4ml. Upshot is my chemo has now been stopped after 4 of the 6 cycles and I'll start Herceptin next week with Letrozole and Radiotherapy to follow. Has anyone been, or know of anyone who's been, in this position and if so what was the outcome? ((((((Hugs)))))) to you all xx Sorry also posted in Feb Chemo Club",

      "Content": "Hi Dreamthief,Â  Yes it is the shortfall in taxane therapy that concerns me. Oncologist already said that because epirubicin and Herceptin can both have a detrimental effect on the heart I can't have more FEC either. It does concern me that if three cycles of a taxane are recommended then one cycle is not sufficient to do the job. I'll see my oncologist tomorrow but was looking here for someone who had been in this situation, how they were coping and how closely they were monitored. Thanks for replying, Gill xxx",
