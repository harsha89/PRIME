      "Content": "Good evening all, I was diagnosed with IDC on the 1/2/2018 since then i have had Li-cap/ Li-tap surgery to remove the tumour  with reconstrution and SNLB.  The tumour turned out to be 28mm, Grade 2, ER8 PR8 HER2 negative.  they took one sentinel node which showed cancer. I was expecting radiotherapy with 5-10 years of hormone therapy, however I'm now told chemo and need to think about the treatment I want for the armpit (axilla).The options are surgery, radiotherapy or POSNOC trail. I am unclear as to why they saying chemo as the cancer was HER2 negative and from what I understand this is less suitable for chemo and has anyone have any info on POSNOC. Any help would be useful.",
