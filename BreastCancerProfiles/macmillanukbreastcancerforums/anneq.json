    "Content": "I'm a week into my first of 6 FEC T treatments, having been diagnosed with Breast Cancer in November, and WLE + sentinel node biopsy.The day following the chemo my District Nurse administered an injection of Neulasta Â prescribed by my oncologist \"to stimulate the bone marrow to produce white blood cells\". I don't remember being told of any side effects to expect from this. This morning at 4.00 am I woke in agony with pains in my lower back, radiating around the sides, down into my legs, and up my back. It was like labour pains, and very frightening and I ended up calling the brilliant Christie Helpline. The nurse explained it was probably the injection starting to work and my bone marrow going mad making new cells, advised me on pain relief and re-assured me. I have coped with the pain today with a mixture of co-codamol and ibuprofen. It has helped to visualise those little cells working away hammer and tongs to build me up. Has anyone else had this and have any tips for coping?",
