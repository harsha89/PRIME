      "Content": "Thank you ladies. The quandary was eased by a phone call from the BCN saying my results aren't back . I have another whole week to tackle the ever growing pits . New appointment made for the 28th to find out if it's just radiotherapy or chemo and radiotherapy or further surgery, chemo and radiotherapy. What will be will be.  If hairy armpits are my greatest concern, I'm a lucky lass!  Have a great day girls, I'm full of love for you all today! ❤️️",
