    "Content": "My tumour was a grade 3, it hasn't spread but I'm too faced with the Big C they advised its to kill any cancer cells that could be in the blood flow or still in the breast and as its aggressive if it were to grow back it would be worse for me. Meditation and positive energies embracing the chemo will get me to the other side. Our minds are so powerful it controls ur body which will only give u a harder time during chemo stay positive about it and learn to meditate.",
