First appt with onco next Thursday, Onco DX results and proposed treatment plan- expecting chemo as grade 3 in spite of no nodes and clear margins- MX- as ready as I'll ever be...Happy surgery went well and healings all good and actually feel really well virtue of being more mindful of diet and getting enough rest (a bit of a workaholic!)

      "Content": "Hi Luce, You've done absolutely the right thing in getting an appointment at the clinic and there are a million things the dent and puckering could be...and if it is anything nasty then you'll be dealing with it early on. My situation is very different from yours (as everyone's is, its all very individual) but I had a dent and puckering six months before I found a breast lump. I ignored it those first signs- which you are very wisely not doing- because I didn't realise it could be anything to worry about,  I'd lost some weight (on purpose- happily) and put it down to that... Yes I am now having treatment for BC- if I'd dealt with it sooner this would have been an easier ride... All love and luck to you, you can deal with whatever the outcome may be, BC is very treatable if it is that- and it might very well not be... Xx",

I'm 2.5 weeks post left mastectomy and have made a good recovery, well healed, doing the exercises which have really helped and up and out walking and getting back into the swing of some lightish work stuff (I'm self employed and work from home for which I'm very grateful). I went two days ago to my post surgery appointment for histology- ER positive, grade 3 IDC tumour (an upgrade on 2 which it was post ultrasound and mammogram) 1.5 cm within 2.5 of dcis sentinel node clear and margins clear. All in all it felt like good news. I'm now waiting for an appointment with the oncologist and the oncotype DX result.  In my mind if its an intermediate score and above I want to take the chemo so a question or two for folk with knowledge... has anyone been in a similar zone/had a similar diagnosis- what happened in your case? is chemotherapy always totally awful to go through? Many thanks, Xxxx",

Yes I've gone through periods of heavy googling and noted difference in treatment in the US where I think chemo is more favoured for our kind of grade/type... I'll certainly update here when I have more news.  No appointment yet with the onco so I guess they're waiting for the test results.

      "Content": "Hello there Morgana17, At mine- post MX clear nodes ER +- and having already seen surgeon for post op check up it was about looking at treatment options, the predict scoring with and without chemo, recognising tamoxifen would be part of the plan going forwards and agreeing to send off for an oncotype dx test and score (while the NHS still funds this very expensive tool which involves sending a tumour sample to the US). Once the score comes back we'll make a decision about chemo- I'm pencilled in- oncologist says score higher than 25 = definite chemo...anything under that becomes vaguer in terms of benefit and I'm hoping they'll steer the decision making. Its very specific and individual and depends on your kind of BC etc... BCN and oncology registrar also in room alongside the oncologist- very much a team I was made to feel part of... All bests for your appointment, I'm sure it'll be positive and about finding the best way forward for you, X",
