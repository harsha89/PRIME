      "Content": "Thanks eveyone for your lovely replies! It's great to have hear from people who know all about it. It's still seems very unreal at the moment. She is having a wle and node removal and thy described it like a breast reduction? The caner is just behind the nipple and thy are having to insert a guide wire before the surgery to pinpoint exactly where it is as they said it's so small they could miss it. Anyone had this done? The scary part at the moment is waiting 2 weeks for results! How do you cope with the wait? With we could know straight away. X",

      "Content": "Hi, my mum has recently been diagnosed with grade 3 invasive bc. Approx 4mm on scan and nothing seen elsewhere. She has her op on Wednesday followed by radiotherapy. The doctors are very hopeful it has been caught early and think it is stage 1. They said chemo is unlikely. Anyone have any experience with this and can give me any advice please? I'm managing to stay fairly positive for her but I hate seeing her so worried and can't imagine what she is going through. Anything I can do to help her? She is constantly worried about me (I have a 10 month old) and dosent want me to be stressed out. I keep telling her that I'm here for her else matters. Thanks ",
