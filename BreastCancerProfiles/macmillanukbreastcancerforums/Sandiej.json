    "Content": "my partner has bowel cancer and secondry in the liver and abdominal sac, despite chemo this has spread and he has been given the option of a more aggresive chemo or no further treatment, a decision he has to make by Thursday. Like you, the chemo has reduced him to someone we both don't recognise. We are seeing our McMillan nurse tomorrow and I am going to question her about the availability of dietry treatments as an alternative, which can also be used in conjunction with chemo or radiotherapy . I don't know if they work, common sense tells me that there must be a more natuall way of dealing with this disease, but when it's your life or the life of someone you love that's at stake, it's a very big decision to have to make. The thought of life without Lee is totally unbearable, I just want him here with me regardless, but quality of life is important and it is his life so whatever decision he makes he will have my full support. I'm trying to be strong and can't imagine what it must be like for him and for you. I hope things come good for you, xxx",
