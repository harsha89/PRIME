I can't find any words to express my feelings.  Absolute horror and disgust!",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies I am wondering if anyone on her can help me with a decision I have to make.  I was diagnosed in Feb. with stage 1 cancer.  I have had WLE and SNB clear margins (after re-excision) and nodes were clear. Have finished rads am feeling very lucky to have got off so lightly compared to others   However the question of hormone therapy rears its head.  I don't want to take Tamoxifen for five years!!  I am very scared of the more serious side effects.  My oncologist is not pushing it on me ,he is just saying try it and see what happens.  I think he feels that I just don't want the hot flushes and night sweats but it's not that (they can be coped with) it's the more serious side effects that worry me. People also tell me that if I read the side effects for aspirin etc...etc....etc.   Now, I have read about Indole 3 carbinol which is supposed to be the natural alternative to Tamoxifen and it seems to be the answer but is it? Apparently it reduces oestrogen and also blocks the oestrogen receptors. So, my dilemma, which way do I go?  If my oncologist was saying I MUST have Tamoxifen I would not question it  but he's saying it's up to me.   So, to finally get to my question (sorry if I've been long-winded)  are any of you taking Indole 3 Carbinol or have considered it?   Any thoughts about my predicament will be welcomed as I am just so muddled up at the moment.",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your replies ladies and you all make very good points The comment about the here and now cancer especially, because I'm only Stage 1 and didn't need chemo, I think maybe I'm not treating this as seriously as I ought to be doing. I have never felt ill or anything and have perhaps treated it more as an inconvenience. Cannot get an appointment with my GP to get a prescription until next Weds. so will do more research and thinking. My oncologist told me that it will increase my chances of survival by 1% , I think that put me off as 1% is not a lot at my stage.  However he didn't mention recurrance stats so I will contact him about that. I expect that I will go with the Tamoxifen, as you say it is tried and tested but the option to come off it if it proves horrendous is always there.   Thank you all again for your most helpful comments.",
