      "Content": "I agree, GP first. We do still get ailments like everyone else but check it out. I got breathless and my doctor said if it\u2019s a tumour big enough to make you breathless it will show up on an X-ray, agree? He sent me for one, nothing there so I was satisfied. He was very clever and understanding about my worry. Some aren\u2019t but I\u2019m lucky. The worry never really leaves but just accept it is natural and be sensible once it\u2019s been checked out. Put it to one side then. Good luck and let us know. Xx",

      "Content": "Hi Eddiboy. Thanks so much for your reply. I\u2019ve decided to go back in a couple of weeks to see him again. He is a junior at the practice so had to get advice from the senior partner who happens to be my usual GP. I\u2019m so  surprised at her answer to tell you the truth. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t matter anymore and I take a back seat because of all the newly diagnosed cases. I sometimes think \u2018at least I\u2019m here and should be grateful for that\u2019 but this is really bothering me. It is a reminder every day! I actually work in the hospital and have access to the BCN whenever I need. I asked them last year to examine me as I was a bit worried, when the GP found out she wasn\u2019t very pleased I felt. I say if someone hasn\u2019t had cancer they shouldn\u2019t judge and if they have, they should understand, especially in there position as GPs I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019ve been again. I\u2019m sorry about the recurrence. We can pray you\u2019ll have the success now as you did 17 years ago. Do let me know please.  Xx",
