I only started running in July 2014, something I never thought I could do. A half marathon seemed liked a good place to start!! Around the same time my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer so I'm aiming to raise some money to help fight this evil disease which seems to unfortunately touch so many of our lives. I'm running to encourage my mum that anything is possible and she will fight this and be fit, happy and healthy again with all of our support. Anything you can donate is greatly appreciated. \" Thanks for taking the time to read this, she has made me very proud, xxxxx",

      "Content": "Thanks Ali, my usual oncologist was away so saw some young smarmy upstart, who insisted my bloods were too low to have my chemo, and he would reduce my dose and delay it for a week, in the end they did another blood test and sent me home, he was so awful I had a real meltdown at the hospital. The nurse who was with me was lovely and said that I would be fine she would ring me later, she did, my bloods were absolutely fine which I knew they would be, he was so arrogant I shall be having a word next time I go and will refuse to see him again. so I had to go back and pick up my normal chemo tablets and the dose would be the same, I was none too pleased, I knew he was wrong he probably looked at the wrong results, I have the blood tests weekly through each cycle. It was so hot too which didn\u2019t help. Sorry for the rant. Hope you get your appointment soon. They don\u2019t rush do they, the waiting is the worst bit. love and hugs Jenny xx",
