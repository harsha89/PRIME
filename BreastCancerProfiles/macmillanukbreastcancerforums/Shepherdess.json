I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. Just hope I can find the courage from somewhere to go through with it. Thanks again.",

I've only got one chemo left to go and everything was looking so positive, now I've been hit with this, my biggest fear. I'm distraught and don't know where to turn. Thanks again for trying to help.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the site, so I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I am looking for help and would appreciate advice from anyone. I have breast cancer. I have responded really well to treatment and have been told that I do not need a mastectomy. The surgeon has said that he can just remove a small area. The problem is that I am absolutely terrified of needles and he needs to insert a marker in order to be able to remove the area in question. I feel that it has left me with no choice but to have the mastectomy. This is something I really didn't want as I know it will destroy my confidence. I've never had much anyway, but if I lose my breast, I don't feel as though I'll ever be able to face the world again. I know that I should be over the moon with the news he gave me, but my fears have taken that away. Is there any way over overcoming my fears? If anyone has any similar experience of anything like this, I would appreciate your advice. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn,             Thank you for responding to my post. I have spoken to the surgeon about it, but he said that the marker has to put in while I am awake because I have to stand up for the mammogram to make sure the wire is in the right place. I have been thinking about sedatives, but they're going to have to be quite strong because it's instinctive for me to run. I really will need to be on another planet. From the reaction I'm getting, I don't think they've come across anyone like me before and they're probably hoping they never do again! Most of the staff are very understanding, but they've made it clear that I have to be conscious.  Thanks again, Kind regards x",

All I really took in was 'needle', 'wire' and 'there's no other way of doing it'. I just wanted to get out of there. Now I've calmed down, I am trying to consider things that might help. I'm still not sure if I'll be able to do it, but I hope I can. Well done for getting through it and facing your fears. Hope you are keeping well. Thanks again, Kind regards x",

I'm so sorry to hear that you have bilateral cancer and that you also have a needle phobia, it really does make the experience much harder than it already is. It's a very big decision to opt for a mastectomy and I'm sure none of us would want it if we felt we had a choice. Some days I feel I have no choice and others I think I can do what they need me to do, surely I can be strong for one day. I'm very up and down. You've been so brave and should be very proud of yourself. I don't think anyone realises just how brave you have to be to do what you have done. I wish you the best of luck with the rest of your chemo. I am proud of you.   Stay strong, you're almost there. Thanks again, Kindest regards xx",

Well done for being so brave. I only hope I can be as brave. I'm really pleased for you that you only had the surgery you wanted. I hope you feel proud of yourself for facing your fears. Hopefully, I will too, but I still have my doubts. I'm looking at ways to help myself such as cream to numb the area and sedatives, but I don't know how I'll be on the day. It's such a difficult time and I'm having lots of ups and downs. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond, it helps to know I'm not the only one with this phobia.  Take care, Kind regards x",
