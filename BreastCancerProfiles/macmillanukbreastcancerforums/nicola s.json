Ok you have to go to hospital once a week to get them flushed, but no more stress of the needles!!! Good luck and If you need more Info private mail me. Nicola x",

      "Content": "Had my 4th cycle of docetaxel/cyclophosamide last tuesday, after every one I get a rash which with everyone seems to get worse and more widespread. Spoke to one of the chemo nurses on Monday about It when I was getting my line flushed, she suggested Piriton and aqueous/calamine cream as looks like an allergic reaction. Have been using these since monday with no Improvement. The rash Itself I can live with, however the Itch Is unbearable, between that and the night sweats/flushes I am getting very little sleep.....Im driving myself nuts, never mind my poor long suffering hubby who still needs to get up for work and never complains. I don't want to tell oncologist as he has already suggested they may need to stop due to low bloods, this Is the second time In under 2 years for me so need to throw everything at It! Has anyone else experienced this and any suggestions to stop the Itch? Nicola x",

      "Content": "Hi Anne-Marie Thanks for your reply. My rash after first cycle was only on my head, neck and behind my ears, after every cycle It seems to get worse and now covers my full torso, shoulders, so basically the full of my upper body. I went to my gp and they gave me antihistamines and steroid cream, seems to be helping a bit, however the rash Is still raised and angry looking, I will keep using the above and fingers crossed It will settle by next tues for next chemo. This will be my 5th of 6 cycles, so not long to go...yipee! I had 6 FEC last year, had a lot of side effects with that, however feel this one Is worse.......maybe thats Just because Im still going through it. Hope the rads Is going ok and thanks for the advice Big hugs xxx",
