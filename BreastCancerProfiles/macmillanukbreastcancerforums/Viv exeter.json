      "Content": "Hi , I'm due to start taking them too. But have decided to start after my radiotherapy has finished , give my body chance to deal with one thing at a time . I was hoping to come on this site and read a few more positives from some other Anastrozole patients. Anyway I will remain hopeful when I start taking them in 6 weeks time , but am grateful for any positive advice for coping . Love to all in this unusual club of ladies",
