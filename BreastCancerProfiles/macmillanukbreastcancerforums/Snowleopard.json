      "Content": "I had 4 TC,  the last on 9th Feb. I used cold cap, and still have  at least 60% of my hair. I had thick hair before and quite a bit came out after the first dose, but much less with the later ones. It just thinned all over rather than chunks coming out. A few strands still coming out now, but hardly any. People tell me they don't even notice.  It is thinner on top than sides - probably where there wasn't such good contact with cold cap the first time. It is important to make sure contact is good - damp hair and spray conditioner (to help loosen cap at the end). I took paracetamol before hand and whilst  a bit uncomfortable for the first 10-15 mins, it soon felt OK, just a bit fuzzy-headed! No headache during or after.  Even though the dosing takes longer, it soon passes and to me anyway didn't seem an issue in the big scheme of things with all the other treatments.  I was concerned about risk of scalp secondaries - my oncologist said there was no evidence.   I was very careful with hair  - washed gently every few days, didn't comb or blow dry and used silk pillow. Scalp was a bit tender sometimes, but that's all.  I did lose most of my eyebrows (and other hair) ! I think there may be an issue with availability and the extra appointment time  for ladies who use cold-cap, which is maybe why it's not always encouraged. There was only 1 at the unit I was at and several of us wanted it so appointments had to be very carefully scheduled, sometimes into late evening.  anyway, good luck whatever you decide  wendy",

      "Content": "I am Day 7 after  2nd of 4x TC and  I am using cold cap.  Towards the end of 1st TC  (about day 16) I started to lose chunks of hair and  am still losing it, but so far you wouldn't notice really. My oncologist said I would lose it all without cold cap and less than 50% chance of keeping  some with cold cap,  I have normally thick hair.  I'm going to keep using it, if I can keep rate of loss as it is now, then hope to have enough left at the end to look 'presentable'!.   It's funny, the hair is the one thing that makes the whole BC issue 'real' for me, other things have been easier to deal with and contrtol, but without hair there is no escaping what you are being treated for.",

      "Content": "I finished 4TC last dose 9th Feb. I painted my nails black with a  dark colour on top, and have had no trouble apart from slightly tender nail beds on big toes and thumbs for a few days. None has come loose or fallen off and I have had no infections, in fact they seem very strong and growing well. Interestingly there are 4 small ridges across each nail - one for each cycle of chemo !!",
