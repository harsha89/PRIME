      "Content": "mistymoley kazash56 I'm sorry to hear that you are struggling. Did your  oncologist give you the statistics for taking anastrozole?  The % difference may not be significant enough to continue, but if it is, do talk to your team and see if there are options for you.  I was told the first two years on Tamoxifen were shown to have the biggest effect, so I stopped around this time, but you have to do what is right for you.  I think it might feel worse as a man, as the oestrogen strips muscles of strength and you will feel the fatigue as a result.  If you haven't already, you could try different  brands, do have a search through the groups to find what people have tried. Hi. Mistymoley. I phoned BCN and she is going to arrange appointment with onc.  she thinks they will change meds from Anastrozol to something else. Hope so this fatigue is getting unbearable. Xxx",

Followed by Herceptin which finished last December. I am now taking anastrozol . At first I had hardly any side effects but the last three months have been terrible.  Hot flushes  I ache all over but the fatigue is the worst. Some days I feel like I haven't got the energy to breath nevermind anything more strenuous.  I have been told it is a side effect of anastrozol and I am starting to question whether I want to stay on this drug. I feel  90 not 59. It's really getting me down.  Hope you are doing ok. Xx",

However I note that you have been on Anastrozole for 19 months and I suspect that you have had various brands in that time.  Did you notice if any particular brand gave you less side effects?  Alternatively you could ask if you could be put onto Arimidex to see if you get less side effects or none at all!  Anastrozole is the generic form (patent now expired meaning other pharma can now make it) of Arimidex and it's the fillers that cause the side effects. It is always worth an ask. Hi Chloecat45. I have tried different brands and found Accord to best for me. One brand (beginning with W ) didn't suit me at all.  I thought I was doing ok but seem to have lots of side effects hit me all at once . Just hope to get things sorted as soon as possible as it's really getting me down at the moment. Xx",

      "Content": "tessiecat1 Hello Kazash, could have written your letter myself! Been 2 years on anastrozole, now found to have osteoarthritis, particularly bad in spine. Have had second DEXA scan which showed worsening osteopenia (have been taking Adcal D3) and nearly 2\" height loss. Took myself to Oncs and now taking bisphosphonates and told to change from anastrozole to either tamoxifen or exemestane. As I'm post menopause decided against tamox and will be taking my first exemestane tomorrow (that is of course if Boots will eventually have it in stock!!).  I've also had tendonitis in thumb, had corticosteroid injection which has sorted that out. I take 20mg amitriptyline at night and now get to sleep, and can get through without waking up with back/leg pain - do need to get up for loo, but able to get back to sleep - something I had not been able to do for months.  Have put EVERYTHING that is now wrong with me down to the anastyzole (even though it could be me now at the great age of 63).  It seems to be the devil or the deep blue sea - even the exemestane give side effects of joint pain. ARRGHGHGH, so does the bifossywhatsits - took my first one Monday (and shush -  managed to sit/stand for 1/2 hour and didn't feel nauseous, or have any other pains, perhaps I shouldn't look at the side effects leaflet, but so far so good). I saw a BCN, even though I'd asked to see the Onc, and BCN had to go rushing off and see Onc for advice, then thrust the tamox & eme leaflets at me, said to make up my mind & ask my doc to prescribe them, no info on the bifossy at all, moan, whinge, and moan again. Still, I'm still here and even though I'm like a crab getting down the stairs in the morning, movement does ease up after a while.  Am doing lots of exercises to improve bone strength and keep muscles moving.  Don't really feel much back pain due to the amittrip - which I find amazing, but it did work.   Oooh, have wittered on far too long. Hope some of it gives you some help.  My doc has been fantastic, always wih the belief that 'something can be done about pain', so very grateful to her - she's been more help that BCN!   You should not have to continually suffer pain like that. Do you have a good doc? Hugs to you. Let me know how you get on. xxx Hi.Tessiecat1\". The things we have to put up with.  We are going away for a long weekend tomorrow and I'm dreading it with all the aches and pains and having no energy. When I had my DEXA scan they found out I already had osteoporosis so have to take acid tab and calcium. I'm really lucky to have a brilliant BCN. If I tell her of any worries I have you can bet there will be a appointment in the post within a few days to get things checked.  I had to laugh thinking of you getting down the stairs like a crab. We must look a right pair in a morning trying to get our bodies to work.LOL. let me know how you go on with the Exemestane.  Take care. Xx",
