    "Content": "Hi, I cannot advice on cold cap as I'm on R-chop and lost my hair anyway.  If you do decide to go without cold cap and lose your hair I found a fantastic company which do something better than wigs.  I paid nearly £300 for wig which I rarely wear as I get too hot in it and get headaches if worn too long.  I also felt that people knew it was a wig.  I wanted something more lightweight and easy to wear.  This company sell some really lightweight pretty scarves which you incorporate with hairpieces like messy pony tails and various other hairpieces.  I bought one called a short Lydia pony tail and I just wish I knew about these before I paid all that money for a wig.  I wear it all the time now and feel confident in it.  The company has only just set up and has a website you can view them on but at the moment until they set up fully you cannot order online.  There contact details are on the site though. They are also reasonably priced.  My headpiece including scarf was £55. The website is: www.comfihair.co.uk Hope this helps  Vicky x",
