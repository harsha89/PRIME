      "Content": "Hello, I have popped over from the womb cancer group as I am concerned about my sister-in-law, who is 55. she told me today that she has had  pain for about three weeks from edge of underarm towards her nipple. My immediate response was for her to see her GP,but she said oh!! its nothing really,but it really worries me as even if it turns out to be nothing it is worth a visit to her surgery. As I have grade3 serous fallopian tube / womb cancer maybe I am over reacting. It would be interesting for your thoughts on here as I know little about breast cancer personally & if she cannot feel any lumps should I worry. Georgette x ",

      "Content": "Hi, I had the taste problem with 1st & 2nd chemo sessions,& agree that drinking lots of water does help. The other thing is I clean my teeth after every meal & brush my tongue which helps . I tried also a remedy that was given to me by a old chef but this was to remove garlic taste & breath smell. 1 teaspoon of lemon juice & chopped parsley sound horrible but I found it helped. I used frozen chopped parsley which I got from Sainsbury's but probably available from other supermarkets. I f you get ulcers or a sore mouth you would be advised to get a prescription mouthwash,as I was told by the Oncology nurse that over the counter washes do not work. I  hope you find something that works for you. Take carexxx",
