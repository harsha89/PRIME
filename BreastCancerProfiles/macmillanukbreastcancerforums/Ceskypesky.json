      "Content": "Hi Karin , my eyes bothering me too , barely any lashes which doesn't help but I think it's a symptom of chemo too. I'm ok at moment. Feel normal! Whilst T was worse than FEC for about day 3 to 5/6 recovery since then quicker I think. I'm struggling with the dressings on my PICC line tho. Have been fine but since Sunday I'm red and itchy and a bit sore on my underneath side of arm at edge of waterproof dressing. Odd as I've had same dressings before and it's not all over. Have rung District nurses and asked them to come and look but not heard anything yet.    Claire ",

Going to take pain killers in advance this time in an effort to ward off aches and pains. I've put of my last treatment until 28 July which is 4 weeks instead of 3 as have a family wedding on 23rd and don't want to be feeling pants. They were quite happy with that. Feel like I can see light at end of tunnel now so that in itself makes it not so bad! Good luck to those having treatment this week.   Claire xx    ",

      "Content": "It's hit me too! Day 4 First T. Aches started last night then overnight I was awake off and on, flu like symptoms. Aching all over rather than joint pain. I got up and did school run but do feel weird. Aching is less but have a fuzzy head, just feel off really but am able to function! Hope it passes as with the kids would struggle for more than a few days like this! This is worse I would say than my FEC experience but possibly it's because it's the first one and the unknown again as FEC 1 was the worst for me, maybe T 2 and 3 will be better?!! Wishful thinking but either way it's only two to go. Keep well all xx",

Started to feel a bit better yesterday and today better again apart from horrid taste in mouth and tiredness. I managed to keep doing things at a slower pace as with three kids there isn't much choice! I'm on sofa now as I seem to get really weary after not doing much. Hoping that each day will get better and I'll feel normal again soon before facing the next lot! At least I'll know what to expect next time. Hope everyone is doing ok or as ok as possible in the circumstances!  Claire x",
