      "Content": "Thank you for responding so quickly.  It is good to hear other people have the same kind of conversations with themselves too.  My husband is fully aware and is an absolute rock.  He will be with me every step of the way however I really don;t want to scare my son, especially if all ends well and it is a cyst etc.  We lost my Dad to cancer two years ago and my Son slept on the hospital floor with me when his Grandad was really poorly. He has taken the loss very hard so I really don't to take him back to rember those horrible times again.  Thank you for the advice about asking questions, it is something I make sure I do.  With many thanksx  ",

      "Content": "Dear Pepys, thank you for your post, it has really re-affirmed my thoughts on not telling my son. I have not told even my sisters or my mum as we lost my dad two years ago to cancer so they are still recovering and I don't want to hinder that. My husband is absolutely fabulous so I am leaning on him so much. My lump seems to have gone down since I discovered it on Saturday, it is not nearly as prominent as it was so I am hoping above all hopes this is a good sign. I wish you well and thank you for taking the time to get in touch with me xxx",

      "Content": "Hi, I found a lump in my breast on Saturday night and went to the doctors yesterday.  The doctor said as it is hard it is worrying but as it is moving that is a good sign.  He has referred me to the hospital and said I will have a ultrasound scan and mammogram within two weeks which is excellent but I feel like I am going mad already.  I have the most fantastic husband and a wonderful son of 19.  My son and I are so very, very close and I am having discussions in my head whereby I have to tell him I am unwell which is killing me and it is also really ridculous as I haven't been diagnosed with anything.  Apologies if I sound mad but I wondered if anyone had gone through this too. Wishing everyone well.  ",
