      "Content": "Citalopram doesnt suit everybody, and whilst it may be fine for some taking Tamoxifen, in others the side effects may be greater, and to a point where an alternative Anti-depressant from a different drug group may well work better. I know of several people who find that their anxiety has actually increased on Citalopram, and they are lifted to a 'High' where they simply cannot settle. If this is happening to you, then its worth asking your Gp about a swop over to something that will be more suitable for controling the anxiety as well as lifting the depression, such as Mirtazipine, although this would need to be checked by your pharmacist for any contra-indications whilst taking the Tamoxifen, as its not something that I have come across before as I previously worked in Mental health rehab.

      "Content": "Im so sorry to hear about your mum scarlett, I know only too well how difficult it can be to see your mum suffering so much as i went through a similar situation with my own mum back in the 1980s. Im actually a trained Psychiatric nurse myself, and although i know nothing about Fasodex, I do know that Diazapam is an anti-anxiety drug, not an anti-depressant, which is a different drug group entirely. Sometimes a combination of Diazapam and an anti-depressant are used together, so i would really speak to your doctor and possible get one prescribed for your mum, prefably from the type that have a sedating effect rather than a stimulant, such as Mirtazipine 15mg. I am taking these myself at the moment afer trying several types of anti-depressent after the recent breast cancer diagnosis in my 33year old daughter, and i find them really good. Julia   ",
