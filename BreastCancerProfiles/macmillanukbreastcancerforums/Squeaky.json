I take letrozole and have been on it now for six months. Any medication always gives a list of side effects but people are affected in different ways. I have had two issues with Letrozole. I had rather horrid hot flushes at first and that lasted maybe two months. Also I'm having short term memory problems with it. This might be age too! However, now I realise what's happening I keep a notebook. So I just wanted to say that not everyone has the side effects. Squeaky",

I am not quite in the same situation as your step mum. I am a little younger, nearly 65. When I talked to the oncologist she said for my profile it would be a 3% improvement and I didn't hesitate to say thanks but no thanks. She put me under no pressure at all. So I went on to radiotherapy. I think where it is clear cut that chemo would be beneficial the oncologist will offer it and you can of course refuse. Where we are borderline the oncologist will try to give us options and figures but leave the choice to us. Your last paragraph is very insightful. The thing is we dont know what is in front of us when we make choices. Please continue to support your step mum in whatever choice she makes. Squeaky",

I didn't have exact figures but on because I had a small tumour and no lymph node involvement i had a good prognosis. The 4% is, i think, based on a cohort of women in the same situation and gives improvement rate of that amount generally - but maybe not for a particular individual. Statistics are useful but they cannot give a guarantee. I didn't spend long thinking about this because 4% didn't seem much to me. I don't try to persuade anyone not to have chemo but I do speak up to say I didn't so that people feel they can make choices. My two year check up has just taken place and currently there is no evidence of disease. But who knows about the future! Squeaky",

As chloecat says you can opt not to have treatments. I was borderline for having chemotherapy and decided not to have it but had radiotherapy with minimum side effects and am now on letrozole which is a hormone therapy similar to the one chloecat is taking. With that I have had minimum side effects but I know others have had joint pain and other things. When making decisions about treatment I thought about myself and my lifestyle and what I wanted to do. I didnt have DCIS. I had invasive cancer. I had to have a reexcision after the WLE as the tumour margins were not clear. This came as a surprise but I know know it's the case in about 20%. the surgeon said he had booked me in for the op in three days' time and I blurted out 'But I'm going to the theatre that day and i've got good seats. Assuming it was local and an evening performance the surgeon said he would have me out in time to go. As it was an afternoon performance 60 miles away I changed the tickets but I could easily have gone out that night after the second operation. I'm sure you will cope well with whatever happens next.
