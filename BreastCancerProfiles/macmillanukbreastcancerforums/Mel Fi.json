      "Content": "Dear Rhia, It is great that you have had the courage to write here. I was lucky and my white spot disappeared quickly, but it is very important that you go get yours checked by a doctor, especially as you've had it a long time and it is painful. Please carry on with this courage and go get it seen. No questions are silly in what health is concerned. If it's something small, you'll get it out of your way. If it's important, you will finally start getting treatment for it. Either way you will be better off by going to the doc, plus you will have the peace of mind. Feel free to comment here at any point. We are supporting you. Hugs, Gèni ",
