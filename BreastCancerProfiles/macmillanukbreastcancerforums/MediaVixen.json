    "Content": "Hello everyone! Thought I would throw myself into your arms in the hope of picking up some nuggets of comfort following a fairly mind-numbing appointment with my breast surgeon on Thursday. I had my mastectomy and ANC two weeks ago having come through a lumpectomy and 6 cycles of chemo pretty well.  However, I was stunned to be told in a very matter of fact way that the chemotherapy hadn't worked, that 22 out of 26 lymph nodes were still cancerous and 10cm of breast tissue was also infected. Apparently, all the team were quite surprised by these findings - but perhaps not quite as shocked as me quite frankly!   I never realised that chemotherapy might not work for one thing - was I naive in that? Have been put on Tamoxifen straight away and will move on to radiotherapy in a few weeks. Then MRI scans every three months.  Eight months ago I was extraordinarily fit and healthy (so I thought!) and now feel that instead of seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, it's another black hole. Am a very positive person but could do with a bit of support from those who really understand!",
