    "Content": "I am so glad you posted an update. I have been wondering how you were doing. When you don't post for long while i worry. What a very selfish roommate you have! I hope she thinks about what she has said to you now that she is \"all alone\"! I'm just sorry you had to go through that emotional turmoil with all that you have already been through! You are a strong, intelligent, beautiful young lady. Any guy you date is extremely lucky! I understand your decision regarding the chemo. I have found that our intuition is a positive key to our health. Good luck on Monday and i will be keeping you in my prayers.",
