      "Content": "Last year in May I had a diagnostic mammo then ultrasound. They found 2 masses/lumps in my breasts. I had a ultrasound core needle biopsy on the left breast. Came back benign. I then had other issues happen such as 3 blood clots in my lungs ect. My doctor, husband and I decided that to make absolute sure that they were benign that we would do a lumpectomy on both breasts. Came back benign again thankfully. A ultrasound core biopsy is not always 100% reliable and to be quite certain we had the lupmpectomy's. I was due for a recheck diagnostic mammo earlier but there were so many things going on that I got my recheck later than planned. So this month I had my recheck mammo/ultrasound and they found more abnormalities in lumps I can feel. So Friday I have bilateral ultrasound guided core biopsies.",

The results from last year were that they were benign. But the spots I have now are new. Did the radiologist give you a BiRad score? Mine was a 4. I pray that your biopsies are benign. This is a great place for support.",
