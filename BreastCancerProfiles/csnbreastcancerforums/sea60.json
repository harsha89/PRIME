My latest is \"The Little Pink Ribbon book\" filled with a compilation of poems, short stories and such. You can never have enough of those. Women instinctively love to share. That's why you have so many of these wonderful books about Breast Cancer. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen one on Prostate cancer or any other cancer for that matter as I've seen for Breast. I wish there would be. I find them so helpful! Let us know how it's going :)",

It was right in the midst of my Chemo. \"Come to me, all you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke fits perfectly and the burden I give you is light.\" The anology here is farmers in ancient Israel used to train inexperienced ox by \"yoking\" it to an experienced one with a wooden harness. The straps around the older animal were tightly drawn. He \"carried\" the load. But the yoke around the younger animal was loose. He walked alongside the more mature ox, but his burden was lighter. In this verse Jesus is saying, \"I walk alongside with you. We are yoked together. But I pull the weight and carry the burden.\" When we suffer and are in pain, how much MORE must He feel? Sending you a cyber {{hug}}, prayers and a shoulder to lean on.",

I tried it, and after a while it did work, however, I'm not 100% convinced it was the mustard. I think maybe the Tumeric in the mustard is good for that.

I know how hard life can be and getting diagnosed with an illness really feels unfair. Some people do crazy destructive things with their bodies yet seem healthy while some who are health conscience get sick. It doesn't make any sense. I asked God many questions myself, especially during the height of my treatment. I wished I would have had direct answers right then and there when I demanded them but I didn't. When I was ready to search for Him, did I find the promise that He wouldn't leave me and that gave me reassurance. I think it's the complete opposite, He isn't laughing, He's grieving alongside us. I hope that once you finish the Taxol, you WILL feel a whole lot better. Man, wouldn't it would be great if there was a magic pill out there? Sending you big hugs, Sylvia",

      "Content": "Yes, for me, it was emotional and almost surreal. I had walked years past for someone else and now, here I was walking as a cancer survivor. I felt strong, yet weak at the same time, I was joyous to see so many survivors but sad for the ones that left us early. I caught the eye of many who looked at me with admiration as I wore the \"pink\" t-shirt. So for me, I experienced a myriad of many emotions. And you know what? I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I'll be walking with you guys in spirit. You have a good support team, including that wonderful husband of yours who I would think would place a \"lightning ring\" on every one of your fingers! Have fun. Sending prayers your way! Sylvia",

The 2 big things I just couldn't tolerate were the joint pain and I also had a hard time with my swallowing reflux...weird. Apparently it was from the Arimidex. Anyway, I'm back on the Tamoxifen.

I just wore a really loose blouse and cut up a 100% cotton t-shirt and positioned it across my radiated side and wore a very loose bra. It worked. Just keep up with the cream. I'm sure they'll give you suggestions on what cream to use. It'll be over before you know it. Hugs!  ",

I think being human, it's natural given our circumstance to fear dying from this. I can only speak for myself when I say that given statistics based on my type of tumor, some of the research was scary. To better fight this, I decided (again for me), not to delve into statistics but to just fight this thing. That was my mode I chose, this is an unwelcomed guest that needs to get out. After all treatments and surgeries, I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I was very conscientious of that \"5 year\" mark. But along the way, and upon the advice of my oncologist, I just needed to live life with the new me. Despite some obstacles, FIND that normalcy. Time does diminish that fear that hides in the corner. When I am reminded of it, especially when you hear about someone you know or a famous person having a reoccurrance, I really try hard to 1) whisper a prayer for that person and b) be thankful for every day. I don't want to live in a state of over worry. But it takes time and effort to not dwell. I'm praying for you. We all understand that worry and fear.  Best wishes, Sea60 (Silvia)  ",

      "Content": "I know there are many contributing factors causing cancers, but it's just so hard to ignore how many people in our subdivision growing up have been diagnosed. The subdivision was built back in the late 50's not far from an air force base. This was of course, your typical neighborhood back in the 60's & 70's where all of us kids (and there were a bunch) played for endless hours outside, in the dirt, on the grass, drinking water straight from the hoses...you know, REAL fun. Now, just about every house has at least one person that has or had been diagnosed with cancer...and some have more than one family member. I fall into that category. My Dad is a 14 year colon cancer survivor, (no breast cancer on either side though). My childhood friend who is 49 was diagnosed about 6 years ago with luekemia. My other neighbor who grew up there was just diagnosed with stomach cancer...she's about 44! So it's not only older folks but us kids who are now older. I mean, is cancer THAT common? Has anyone had any experience with cancer being localized in an area? Years later, rumor had it that a lot of areas around the base were used for dumping toxic waste. So, if its proven, it's a dead end anyway...it would be against the Government. I wonder how many people ever ask for a soil sample to check any hazardous waste...ever here about that? Just something to think about.",

Maybe that was the way MY body reacted to it. I also had major joint pain and I even had problems swallowing. Once the Onc switched me back, those symptoms went away so I think that medication didn't agree with my system. You also were taking care of your parents so you had a lot on your plate.
