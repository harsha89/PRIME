    "Content": "Hi, I just finished treatment for breast cancer. I was diagnosed almost a year ago with stage 2 breast cabcer on my left breast. I had chemo first, surgery, & then radiation. I have decided to wait a year and then make a final decision about reconstruction. I just could not make a decision and felt I needed to let my body heal. Right now I am having a flare up of fibromyalgia and I am really glad I am postponing the reconstructive surgery. It has not been very hard to get used to having one breast and I have not been wearing a prosthesis. I found them uncomfortable so I just wear sports bras and dress in a way that \"hides\" or makes it less obvious that I don't have 2 breasts. I think that right now my body is trying to recover from so many treatments and that is why I am having this bad flare up of the fibromyalgia. Anyway, I don't know if this helps at all but I wanted to wish you good luck also and let you know I am here if you have any questions.",
