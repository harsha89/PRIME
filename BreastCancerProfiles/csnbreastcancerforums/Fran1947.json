      "Content": "Hi, I just had Taxotere without the cytoxin and my hair started falling out at the end of the second week. At first I went outside a couple of times a day and ran my fingers through my hair and tossed handfuls at a time into the wind for the birds to use for their nests. but my scalp was pretty sore so I eventually let my husband shave my head. After that I was fine. I finished treatment 6 months ago and my hair has come back curly, but I'm not sure it will stay that way. One of the side effects for me was an extremely dry mouth. I used Oasis moisturizing mouth wash, which I found very helpful. My dentist recommended it, not my oncologist. The worst part, for me - and everyone is different - was extreme fatigue. I had my treatments on a Wednesday and felt fine until Friday afternoon, when I would get just a little shaky - but by Saturday morning I was barely able to get up to brush my teeth. That part lasted 2-3 days, then I would slowly start to feel better. It was not as bad on treatments 2 & 3, but then the last treatment was the worst. I also had joint/bone/muscle pain, but it was manageable with tylenol. I have heard many people say that Claritin makes a huge difference. Hang in there - it is a hard path, but definitely do-able. I can now say I am cancer-free and that makes it all worth it. Hugs, Fran",
