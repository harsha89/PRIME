      "Content": "So, normally I am complaining about my hubby...he doesn't do enough around the house...never does the dishes or worries about what's for dinner... But, tonight we had a serious discussion... I have been off work since January...my RO has given me a letter to be off for breast ca until August 1st as I just finished rads May 31st and I will be on long term leave as of August 8th, so I will be reduced to 65% of my pay. I know most of you have not been paid while on sick leave and I am complaining about this...but I am the major bread winner in the family. So, this is a big chunk of our money coming in. I am scheduled for surgery on July 6th - thyroid ca and again on Aug 9th - hysterectomy...then I'll need radiation for thyroid ca, so I'll be off for another 3 weeks. This should put me to about the first week of October, so we will be at the reduced pay for about 2 1/2 months. I said to my hubby, if I go in to work for the next 2 weeks, then when I leave for surgery on July 6th I will be starting a new illness and it would be covered at 100% for the next 6 months again. He said...We are not going to make a decision on your health based on money...we will figure it out...remortgage or whatever we have to do...you are not ready to go back to work, so stop it. I wanted to say that for myself, but I was thinking...I can just go in for 2 weeks...I'll be fine. Please be aware that work for me is extremely stressful and demanding. We are extremely short staffed. I am one of the few long term employees (22 yrs) and I am the type to get involved with everything. (And usually solve most of the probs...) So, hubby saved me from having to put myself out there and be exhausted prior to my next fight(surgery). For that I will be grateful to him forever...he really is a saint...ok, he is still not so useful around the house...can't get him to clean/cook, etc...lol...but he's a wonderful man and has been my rock through all of this. Thought I'd post something positive for once...I usually only complain :)",

We invited a couple over for dinner that night...so we are all sitting at the table, and our son says to the female of the couple...\"You know what? My Dad's penis is huge!\" She actually held herself really still, and said \"Really?\" My husband and I wanted to crawl under the table...we all let it slide during dinner, but my husband was constantly asked by the friend \"You know what???\" for the next few years...it was absolutely hilarious...LOL.",

      "Content": "Hi Suzanne. I had permanent eyeliner done years ago...I have blue eyes and really fair skin, and have always worn blue eyeliner...so I opted for the color blue. Just so you know, it didn't last very long...my mil went for brown and hers lasted much longer. You can get touch ups in a year or so to make them stay longer. You can still see mine if you look really hard...but I still put on eyeliner when wearing makeup as you can't see it. We went to a school where they learn how to do it...they use a tattoo needle to mark the line, which kind of sears the skin. Then they put on a gel that numbs the skin. The first part hurts, but not too bad. Then they go back over the line and make it deeper/permanent. It was a little painful...I remember having to put some gel stuff on it for at least a week - and it looks funny for a week or so, so if you have any outings, make sure they are more than a week later. Regarding infection, I don't know where you are at in your treatment. There is a risk (with any tattoo) for infection, so again I recommend you ask your onc. Regarding the eyebrows, if you know where your brows will grow back, they I would say go for it...but what if they grow in slightly below/above where the tattoo is?? I would go for the eyeliner, but wait for the eyebrows...just a thought. Anyway, good luck with it. I hope you enjoy it. Any idea what colour you will do?? My MIL also had lip liner done and it worked really well...",

      "Content": "Ok, so I also had my eyeliner done...and then right afterward I had my eyelashes done. I had it done at Merle Norman (don't know if they have this in the US but any spa should do it). They put stuff on your lashes that stays and it lasts for about 6 weeks...wake up and just go, you already have eyeliner and mascara on...it was great! Just a thought if your interested... By the way, I just about freaked out when I had the lashes done...you have stuff put on both eyes and have to wait about 10 minutes where you can't see and they leave you alone...take a friend with you to talk to... Anyway, take care all...S73",

      "Content": "Hello All. So, I am still waiting to see if I need chemo or not...I definately need rads...doing the onco testing to see how effective chemo will be, then will make decision on chemo. After they finish the bc treatment, I need surgery for a thryoid cancer reoccurance - the surgion and onco decided deal with the breast first. In the mean time, the biopsy on the sentinal node showed no cancer, but did show inflamation...they thought it might be sarcoid, so my gp order a chest xray. xray showed fullness in right lung...my gp was going to order a ct scan for me, in the mean time, saw my onco and he ordered a ct scan and got the appt 3 days later...so took that appt. The onco decided that since I have had two cancers that he would scan from the top of my head to my pelvis to look for mets. Got the results on Thursday...the ct scan showed my lungs are clear - no sign of sarcoid...but it showed a mass near my right ovary...it measures 10 cm by 8 cm...and is pushing my uterus over. I also have 2 bone lesions - one in my head and one in my back. They have scheduled an ultrasound for my pelvis (haven't got the appt yet - hopefully soon) My gp said the bone lesions have probably been there a long time, so they are not urgent...I just don't know what I'm to do next... If the ultrasound does not rule out cancer, I will need a biopsy and that means another surgery...I don't know if this should be before the breast cancer treatment or wait until after... I keep finding more and more...and only as a fluke...if I had waited for my gp to order the ct scan, it would have only been for my chest... I am thankful that they found it all and can only hope this is just an ovarian cyst...but what if it's not...what's next? I can't go through the waiting again...I just want answers...now!! I thought this last ct scan was supposed to tell me everything I needed to know...it just caused more questions/issues...when will it stop? I'm tired of this ride...i want off...can someone please pull the cord so the driver stops so I can get off??? Ok, really, I'm ok...I have to be...it's my son's 14th birthday today...and my daughter is dancing on stage during the afternoon...whole family is coming over for cake and coffee tonight... So, put this all on the back burner, cause I don't have time to feel sorry for myself - I must put on my happy face and pretend all is well...I have to go ice a cake...and figure out what else I haven't done...lol...at least I cleaned the house today so that's done...I'm just so overwhelmed... Ok, finished venting for now...hope all is well everyone.",
