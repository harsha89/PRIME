    "Content": "Good Morning, I have just been prescribed Letrozole/Femara for the senond time.  I was not able to tolerate it several years ago but they are hoping it will be different this time to get me off of tamoxifin. They said I need to see if I could ramp up my Calcium and Vitamin D.  Last time I tried it i had bone and joint aches so bad I could hardly get up.  I am only 50 and ususally very active was wondering if anyone had some advice that might be helpful as I try it for a second time? I do take calcium now but am not sure how much I should be taking and how much Vitamin D will make a difference. Thank so much  ",
