    "Content": "SusanAnne, I had this surgery and it went much easier then I expected. My healing was alot faster and able to walk and move around very soon after the surgery. My problem ended up being the bladder issue. I had problems with urinating and feeling like I had to pee and not being able to. I had the sling procedure done to hold the bladder up. I think it was too tight and I had to stand and bend to go pee. NOT FUN!! That is the bladder issue though. With the surgery of a hystorectomy, it went real easy. I have experienced the hot flashes and covers on and covers off during the night. That is part of menupause. Your hormones will be wacked for a while but I'm sure it will stable out after a while. I also had breast cancer earlier in that year and had chemo which put me in menopause anyway. Actually it's nice not to have to worry about female issues down there anymore. I personnaly tried Arimidex and I ached and hurt so much I took myself off of it and went back to Tamoxiphen. The Oncologist said I had to stay on antihormone medicine for a while. Anyway, the surgery was much easier and less scaring etc then what my mother had to go through. It's great if you want to compare them.",
