    "Content": "Hey Maggs, your message touched me and, yes, we should talk about death. I am not afraid to die because I have come to know God much more deeply since having breast cancer. We all fear suffering but to fear death is silly; it will be just like being born, a good experience. Our Guardian Angels will draw close to us at the end and perhaps we will be able to see them again, as we did when we were young. We will close our eyes, breath our last and when we open them, we will see God. Won't that be fabulous? To actually see the maker of the universe and get a hug from him. If you doubt, just close your eyes and ask God to prove he is real to you and then be prepared for something wonderful and amazing to happen. LinPifer",
