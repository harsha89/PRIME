    "Content": "I went through chemo 2 yrs ago. I had CAT, 6 times every 3 weeks. And yes I was tired. But I had a nurse expalain to me that it was my time to be taken care of. It was ok to be tired and ok to let others help. For the moment it was about me. I know it is hard to let others take care of things but you need to keep your strength to fight the battles in your body. Your family and friends want to take care of you. Probably many wish they coulod take your place. By the way - I am a huge Brad Pitt fan and would watch Legends of The Fall over and over again. I could fall asleep and wake up and never miss anything because I always knew where I was at in the movie. Maybe you could find something like that. Hang in there! There will be a day when you are walking and sharing again. My prayers are with you!",
