    "Content": "Hello fellow comrades! I was diagnosed with Advanced StageIII breast cancer Dec. of 1998. I had 4 round of 2 kinds of chemo, a lumpectomy (when they found a 2nd kind of cancer in the breast), a mastectomy, a stem cell transplant & 7 weeks of radiation. I've been out of transplant 2 1/2 years now praise God! It's so amazing that every week I hear of at least one other person who's just been diagnosed with cancer. I see an oncologist every 4 months - when I was there in April, I had asked a statistic question - the phys. asst. made the comment, it's not a matter of 'if' your cancer comes back, it's 'when' your cancer comes back. I'm trying to keep things in perspective, but I sure wish she had never made that comment! I'm trying to take one day at a time just like the rest of you. Melody Hagelgans",
