My second opinion suggested oncotype but both my onc and surgeon were against it. They both agreed that it had not been around long enough(this was 06)and they said it was not a sure enough thing to take such a chance on. As far as the risk of leukemia, everything I have read, the risk is only about 1%. I know chemo is a frightening though, I was very worried about it myself, but you have to look at the long term picture and do what will increase your chance of living a long healthy life.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, well I think I have posted previously about my sleep problems that started after chemo. I have not had a good night's sleep in over 2 years. Before cancer I used to sleep like a log period. Well I have mentioned it a couple of times to my oncologist and today he said that it is a common problem with cancer patients and especially those who have had breast cancer. They think that it may be caused by chemo induced changes in brain chemistry----the same thing that causes chemo brain etc...This is interesting because I had always read that chemo molocules are too large to cross the blood/brain barrier, but anyway this what he said the theory is at this point in time. So today he suggested I enter a clinical trial that is being done at another hostital(Strong Memorial). They are trying behavior mods and a drug. There are 4 arms and one gets a placebo, another the behav. mod and drug,etc.....So I am meeting with the study coordinator soon. The trial lasts 7 weeks. They can't guarantee though that if there is an improvement in my sleep during the trial that it will last after the trial is finished. I am not keen on taking a drug that effects my central nervous system but I am pretty desperate at this point. My lack of recuperative sleep is really effecting my quality of life. I wake exhausted everyday. Well, I will keep you posted if I actually join the trial.",

I think everyone is different in regards to how long it takes to recover emotionally. You have to take care of you and be patient w/yourself.

They really are great and use soothing music, verbal and visual prompts to slow down your breathing, heart rate, and calm your mind.

For me it was terrifying at the beginning and as treatment progressed, the terror turned into worry and anxiety. Three years from diagnosis, and I still worry, in fact I am getting therapy for my intense fear of death and cancer that has been with me now for the last 3 yrs. That doesn't mean that you will have as much trouble bouncing back from the experience as I have had. I think I am just stuck, sort of like post traumatic stress syndrome I guess. But please be patient with yourself, I think that as time passes, cancer will very slowly take up less of your thoughts and life. Unfortunately the tests and follow-up appts. linger and serve as a reminder, but with time too, they reduce in number. I suppose we should look as these appts. as reminders that we are well and past treatment(you will be too)! Hang in there, and come here often--we are here for you! Eil",

They gave me 2 anti-nausea meds with my treatment(one through I.V. and one oral). These prevented sickness during the infusion, however I always felt a bit weird; dizzy, tired and jittery at the same time by the end of the infusion and for a few days after. My hair started falling out about 3 weeks after my first treatment. I got sick of sweeping up hair--it was EVERYWHERE, so after a week or so I shaved the rest of it off. I wore soft cotton caps around the house and at night. I bought a really cute wig for going out. I was prescribed 4 additional meds that I alternated every 3 hours for the next 4 days after each treatment. They worked well. I usually had some delayed nausea and dizziness a few days after that though. For 2 days after each infusion I only ate bananas, applesauce and toast. A couple of times I forgot and ate something heavier like tuna or veggies and immediately threw up. I also found that as I entered the cancer center for each teatment(after the first one) I would have anticipatory nausea that would last through out my treatment. The doc said that was common and prescribed ativan, which helped. I also found that sniffing a small bottle of orange or lavendar oil helped keep the nausea at bay. I found it in the organic section in my local supermarket. I kept it with me during my long treatments and sniffed it every few minutes and it really helped and calmed me. At my center each infusion chair had a small tv and the chairs reclined. They brought us blankets and snacks/drinks. At lunch time they came around with our choice of boxed lunches. In the infusion room at the hospital there were curtains in case anyone prferred privacy, and at the satellite office there was a half wall around 3 sides and a full curtain in case you wanted to be private or sleep. Every single nurse, doctor, volunteer, etc... that cared for me was kind, patient, and caring. Oncology staff are very special people. You will be fine, you'll see. My cancer center offered a chemo class that I attended and it was very helpful. It covered all possible side effects, and what to expect during treatment and helpful tips. I hope sharing my experience helps even just a bit to make you feel more prepared. Eil",

(Adriamycin, Cytoxan, Taxol) My first treatment was fine during the infusion, but when I got home I had mild nausea. I took my meds though and stuck to a bland diet for a few days and I was ok. The second treatment though was different. I felt unwell during the treatment and was nauseus for a few days and dizzy and jittery for about a week. For the third treatment, my onc. added a bag of aloxi to my chemo. hoping it would improve my nausea but instead it actually made things worse. I became ill as soon as the aloxi entered my vein. My sister said I turned gray. I was ill the rest of the day with vomiting and felt crappy for about 5 days with delayed nausea. I did not get the aloxi for the next 2 AC treatments but the nausea and dizziness was still a bit worse with some vomitting after each infusion. Overall though it WAS DOABLE. I did briefly consider refusing the 4th AC infusion though! The good news is that the last 4 rounds of Taxol were a million times better. My onc. reassured me they would be and he was right. I had moderate bone pain(which I'll take any day over nausea)and fatigue for about a week after each treatment. Some people have a harder time than that with Taxol but most I'm told do not. In general, looking back chemo did suck, but it was not anywhere near as bad as I had feared it would be. As most will agree, its definitely doable. I had my treatments on thursdays and took that day and the friday as sick days and went back to work on the monday. I was tired but was able to manage. I am a teacher and luckily 3 of the AC treatments fell during summer vacation. If not I probably would have taken a few more sick days, but who knows... You will definitely be ok. Keep posting here with your questions; there are so many kind people here who will share and support you through this. I wish I had known about this site during my treatment. Take good care and hang in there, Eil",

This bothered me because you always seemed so stong and positive. I can understand your feelings. Chemo does do a number on your body and the hormones. Its such a shock to the system because its so sudden. It changes everything. Three years later and I am still not enjoying the things I loved before cancer. I am still dealing with the emotional aftermath of the whole horrible experience. And each blood draw, exam, and scan brings it all back. Today I had an MRI and I got a little panicky while they were having trouble getting my i.v. in because the same thing happened when I had an MRI a couple days after my tumor was found. It all came back and so did the sick feeling in my stomach. I don't know what to do about it Mimi. I wish I could offer you some wise, wonderful words of wisdom. I think some people are able to get through cancer without letting it decimate them emotionally. I don't know. I know though for a lot of us, it can take a while to bounce back. You are young as you said you will most likely come out of menopause and the transition could be causing your emotions to be troubled. I am not menopausal, but still seem to be \"stuck\", so who knows? You are obviously very smart, talented, and outgoing. I just know you will come out of this funk and be even stronger for it. I have been very impressed and inspired by how you have been dealing with everything. You are in my thoughts, and please know I am rooting for you! Let us know how you are feeling, ok? Eil",
