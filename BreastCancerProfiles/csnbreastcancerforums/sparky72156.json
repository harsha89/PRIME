      "Content": "Jamie......I understand your fear. I worked on an oncology unit for five and a half years, and I lost my husband to brain cancer four years ago. We all have different experiences that bring us to be the people that we are and I can say that it is very likely that I would refuse chemo. For me, that choice is as personal as religion. I could do radiation and I could do surgery and I could do chemos that don't have the horrific side effects. But the quality of my life is more important to me than the quality, so I believe that, if pushed, I would refuse it. While it is true that I have not gotten to that point so I could possibly change my mind, I do completely understand your hesitation. Please know that no, you are not the only one who feels this way. You must do what you feel is best for you.",

      "Content": "I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy even though I had DCIS in one breast. I did this mainly for peace of mind, but the weight gain/loss thing was a factor, too, since I yo-yo a lot in my weight. As it ended up, they found a very small (0.5 cm) tumor of Stage 1A, Grade 2 cancer in the breast with known DCIS. The doctor told me that, because I had chosen to have the bilateral surgery, I will not need any follow-up medication or treatment of any kind because it won't show up in the other breast! This is the same doctor who said, prior to my surgery, \"We don't generally recommend bilateral mastectomy for DCIS.\" Yesterday, he said to me, \"I don't know what inside you told you to have the bilateral mastectomy, but it sure turned out to be the right decision.\" It worked for me but I know it isn't the right decision for everyone. I found out later that my family thought I was nuts to have both breasts taken, but I knew in my gut that it was the best decision for me.",
