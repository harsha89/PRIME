      "Content": "Hi Maggie: I think I chatted with you on oncology.com chat room. But just wanted to wish you well and say hi and good for you, you'll be our inspiration here at this site. I think you'll like it here, there's a great bunch of women to talk to and I'm sure we can all benefit from your experiences. I know I for one just had my first bout with chemo, and had the worst week after. But I'm back, feeling good, gaining weight, and energy is back so I don't feel so bad any more. But I'm glad your doing so well. Keep in touch. your new friend, vinnie",
