      "Content": "Those ports are amazing! You will definitely grow to appreciate yours and the tenderness will go away. That strange feeling you have in your neck may last a week or so. During my first week I could feel it when I laughed, when I coughed, and when I turned my head side to side. Eventually, my body got used to it and I hardly even notice it anymore. My treatment is done, but I'm keeping my port for awhile. Neither one of my arms/hands can be accessed for the blood draws, so I appreciate the handiness of my port. Glad to hear that the warrior in you is coming out! We'll be thinking of you tomorrow at 10:00 am. Love, Chelle",

      "Content": "I did not have the AC treatments, but I did do 12 weekly infusions of Taxol(switched to Abraxane midway) and Herceptin. I went through my chemo treatment in Jan-March of 2008. What I remember was that I felt pretty tired for the first 3-4 days after treatment, started to improve on the 5th and 6th day, and then felt pretty normal the day I had to go back for another treatment. Sometimes you might have fever/chills with Herceptin for the first few treatments, but that subsides over time. I remember being so chilled that I wore gloves and a coat and hat in the house. Even laying under multiple covers didn't help. That symptom usually showed up on the 2nd-3rd day post treatment for weeks 2-5 of my treatment. Taxol (or Abraxane) can cause some bone pain in your long bones and some neuropathy in your hands and feet (like tingling/numbness), but both of those symptoms go away with time. As far as losing weight, I would recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet. It's not good to lose more than 1-2 pounds a week. I was overweight when I was first diagnosed. I made a conscious effort to eat healthier during my treatments and I sought the advice of a nutritionalist and an medical integrative doctor. They gave me a diet to follow that would not compromise my treatment and would provide me with the adequate nutrition I needed. I did lose about 1 pound per week during that time. I think 10-15 pounds in a 12 week period is a realistic goal, but you do want to be sure you are getting enough nutrition and that you are doing it in a healthy way. As far as exercise, I was not able to get out much in the middle of winter to walk. But I did try to do simple exercises from a TV program. It wasn't intense at all and I didn't do it every day. Since I had not been doing any intense workout prior to diagnosis, I didn't want to overexert myself. Hope that's helpful. Chelle",

      "Content": "Hi Ellie, Glad you found this site. It's been a Godsend to me, but I didn't find it until the end of my treatment. My invasive tumor in my left breast was also just at 1 cm, estrogen/progestrone positive, and HER2 positive (They had to do the FISH test to confirm that). They also found a second primary site in one of my right lymph nodes. I've not heard of equivocal?? I'm sure you're surgeon will fill you in on those details. I'm about to turn 38, married for 13 years, with 4 rowdy yet wonderful boys (ages 11,9,7,5). It's been a very rough year for me, but regardless, I am still blessed. The joy of the Lord is my strength! Chelle",

      "Content": "I had 12 straight weeks of Taxol/Herceptin. I went in on Fridays (sometimes Thursdays). And would start to feel normal again on the day I had to go back for my infustion. With Taxol I had progressively worse allergic reactions each week so I eventually had to switch to Abraxane. The bone pain seemed to increase with each visit, but it did eventually go away post-treatment. With Herceptin, my reaction (fever/chills) got progressively worse with the first 4-5 treatments and then went away. I continued Herceptin for a year and really didn't have many side effects. And as many have mentioned, the fatigue symptoms seemed to accumulate with me, too. Every phase of treatment seems to present its own set of issues. So taking it one day at a time is helpful. Sometimes I would research what to expect for the next phase of treatment....because I like to have an idea of what's ahead....but I tried to keep my focus on the present.",
