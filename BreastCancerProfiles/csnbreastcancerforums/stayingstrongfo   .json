      "Content": "It's a new week, my son's 14th birthday oh course I wake up crying and exhausted. I feel like I could just crawl out of my skin. I think I decided I am not going back to work, I will just let them deal with it I will stay home and focus on me/family and if my job isn't there when I return then it wasn't meant to be and I need FAITH that it will work out. But I am not doing so good with faith. I asked God yesterday if he was laughing at me, what I did to deserve really the last 5 years. I wanted a baby, I prayed, I got checked out, I got pregnant. He had all kinds of health problems, 5 days after he was born he was in surgery, he has Down syndrome. I don't care about any of that he is the baby I wanted and I love him so much so when he was 9 months old I find out I have stage 3 cancer? I know I am still here but damn it when does this crap stop??? I look around at the world and I am like \"really?\" freaking weirdos on tv eating rocks and sniffing gas and I AM THE ONE WITH CANCER? I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy but I wouldn't wish it on anyone of us either! Sorry I just need to vent, vent, vent. I have been forturnate the last few years to feel good. Now I am on Taxol and I feel like Sh*t. I want to feel good and I am so scared I never will again!!! I lost a friend to the same cancer in June she went downhill so fast, it's scary stuff. Now that I vented I have a therapy appt. maybe that will make me feel better too. Ugh. I need a magic pill to fix it all!!!",

      "Content": "I had chemo today and before saw my oncol. he didn't want to talk to me about my leg said we would \"just see what happens\" and then he asked me if about my relationship with in laws, parents, sibs, friends and I was like \"um I get along with people\" and he told me I need to a good support system and walked out of the room. WTH? I went from being happy to scared and wondering what he was talking about. He also said I've only had 5 Taxol's and he was glad of that we'll do more...but he was so distant and weird. I couldn't help but take it personally or do you think it was some residual of the patient before me? UGH like I don't have enough trouble making my tomorrows ruin my todays I don't need the person who is suppose to help me getting in my head and causing me mind games. I know I wouldn't want his job but still..................",
