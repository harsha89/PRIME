    "Content": "Hi...I had a radical mastectomy 43 years ago (!!) when I was 29 years old...also removal of chest muscles, as well. I swim all the time and just use my old forms...they seem to hold up just fine...I get a new breast form every 2 years because I am over 65 and Medicare pays for 3 bras a year plus new breast forms every 2 years (guess there are some perks to getting older!....My bras are quite expensive because they have the pockets already in them...I am lucky to live in a big city in So. California so there are quite a few places to go... Regards, Barbara",
