    "Content": "I have Stage 1, no nodes, bilateral mastectomy. My Onc said definitely no radiation and never thought I would need chemo. The Path report came back....triple negative. Prescribed 4 rounds of TC chemo. Had the first one on 4/5/10. I've been lucky...no major side effects to report except the dreaded hair nightmare. I didn't shave my head immediately because I am stubborn. I tend to delude myself...and I was hoping my hair would only thin a bit...yeah, I was gonna be that rare miracle. Unfortunately, my head started to hurt to the touch and my hair was coming out in strands. No clumps. Since I have 3 more rounds of chemo, I figured there was no way I was NOT going to lose my hair. If anyone out there thinks like me, it's in your best interest to come out of denial. There are no miracles to be had here. I already have one wig...long, human hair. I wanted a shorter, synthetic one I could wear to the gym or just to run errands. I went to the wig store today. They offered to shave my head. I let them do it. Had it shaved down to 1/4\". It was a bit jarring at first to look in the mirror. I am 52 years old, so mostly grey at the roots. I was convinced that I did not want my husband to see me. But, I caved and showed him anyway. He was so kind and said it didn't look as bad as he thought it would. Thank God for a wonderful husband...my last one would have kicked me to the curb at the mere mention of mastectomy let alone hair loss. I haven't cried. Maybe I will at some point...would probably be good for me. I had nice, long hair and, yes, I am kind of sad. It will take me about 3 years to get it back to my long length. I pray for all of us with BC and for those who will have BC. It is a dirty trick, but family and friends who support you and a good sense of humor will see you through. And, there are so many reasons to be grateful each day especially with the improvements made to chemotherapy in recent years.",
