    "Content": "I understand exactly how you feel. I was diagnosed in 2009 and waited 4 weeks for my surgical team. It was an eternity, but well worth the wait. I had Paget's of the nipple areola and DCIS (also Paget's). I discovered it myself realizing something simply wasn't right.I opted for BMX primarily for peace of mind. I knew I would always be waiting for it to recur in the other breast. Additionally I was small breasted and 61 years old. I just decided not to live waiting for the cancer to recur or for a more common variety of BC. The BMX was the best choice for me. I had simultaneous reconstruction with silicone implants. I could not be more pleased. I stayed pretty much the size I was before. Recovery was pretty quick. Though the cancer was high grade, it was early stage, non hormone receptive with no lymph nodes involved. I am now nearly 2.5 years post surgery and have had no problems. I am grateful we have options today.",
