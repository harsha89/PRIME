      "Content": "Mar- I am so sorry you have to go through all this on top of ovarian cancer and your other health issues as well. I, too, have fibro and that alone can be difficult on days. I had a bilateral mastectomy in March and am just finishing up my reconstruction. I will have my final surgery next Tuesday. I had a nipple saving mastectomy and wondered if you had considered one. Since you do not have cancer you may be an excellent candidate. For me, being able to have NSM made the whole thing much less traumatic for me. My surgeon told me when I am done no one will even be able to tell that I had a mastectomy which I think is amazing. I was reconstructed using tissue expanders. The TE process is kind of uncomfortable but not unbearable. On Tuesday they will remove the expanders and place the implants and I will be done. So it was about 4 months from start to finish. I think the biggest difference between breast and ovarian cancer is the obvious changes to the outside of your body. It is hard to take sometime. But plastic surgeons can truly do amazing things these days with reconstruction. They can even create breasts from your own tissue! They will never feel exactly like your old breasts but in my case they will look even better afterwards. There is another excellent site- breastcancer.org- where you can find threads about virtually every subject dealing with breast cancer- testing, surgery, reconstruction, chemo, radiation, etc, etc, etc. So if you need more information check them out as well. And the American Cancer Society has a program called Reach to Recovery. They will match you with a volunteer in your area who can call or visit you as needed. Good luck to you. Kate",
