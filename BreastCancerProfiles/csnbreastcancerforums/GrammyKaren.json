      "Content": "When I had chemo in 2009, it was dose dense Adria, cytoxan and avastin and my mouth became sensitive to the point where I was afraid to eat anything crisp like toast, crackers and spicy foods , forget about it. I brushed with biotene . Thats a good paste and I used the rinse. Made sure to drink liters of water, especially on infusion days. But it took time so I ate yogurts, rice puddings and creamy soups . Stuff like scrambled eggs and sucked it up. cause it all tasted metallic anyway. Mornings before infusion I would have soft bagel and rice pudding to line my tummy. No nauasea no weightloss, but having bm's I wasn't proactive fast enough and it was like passing glass .... it all healed so be patient and gentle with yourself. Love, Karen",
