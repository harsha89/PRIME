      "Content": "Won't take long now to finish your treatment and move on with your life. It won't be the same as before, you will still have challenges and days when you feel like crap but the best part is that you are in control and can do what you need to do to make your life worthwhile. I am just 1 month post treatment. My hair is growing back (and I actually like it) and I am resuming some activities that I like to do. Energy still needs a boost but I have learned to be more patient after this journey. Yes Kelly, I cried sometimes, but I laughed too, and I try to keep the laughter in place of the crying because it really helps me focus on feeling better. Just don't let yourself get depressed, or down on yourself. If you feel like that please talk to your MD about it. This is really a roller coaster ride that we didn't expect but we need to be proud that we are making it through, lift up your chin, dry your eyes and say \"what a ride\". Love you and my thoughts are on their way!!",

      "Content": "I am finished with my chemo (Cytoxin/Taxotere) and 36 radiation treatments. I have been done with radiation about a week. Now I am having pain in my legs and hips at night. It feels like when I had the Neulasta injections. Not stabbing type pain, just dull, achy pain that wakes me up. Anyone have these and what did you do for them? Doesn't seem to bother me in the daytime or when I'm active. Thanks for any information.",

      "Content": "I too had my head shaved. My grandkids were here and we celebrated grandma's hair disappearing. Ha! We also made pictures of bald heads to color so they wouldn't freak out with my baldness. The one thing I found was I needed to wear a cap at night because my head would be cold at first. Let me know if you want some hats and scarves. I have quite a few and my hair is GROWING BACK! WhooHoo!!",
