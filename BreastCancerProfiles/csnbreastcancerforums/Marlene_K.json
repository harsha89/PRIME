There is nothing to do but eat, lay around in the sun, drink, dance, eat some more and drink some more! I just love going on a cruise. I have said that once treatment is over and I have a decent amount of hair on my head, even if I have to take a loan, I will once again take my kids on another cruise. Please share your wonderful memories when you come back!! (no need to tell you to have a good time as it's assured that you WILL)",

I was very energetic and felt great about myself. I have slowly sloped downhill since chemo and have 'gone with the flow' sort of speak. I always worked out early in the morning before waking my kids up for school. In order to do that, I woke up @ 5am. Well, I've attempted on a few occasions to set my alarm for 5 and when it went off in the morning, I changed it to 6, convincing myself that sleep is more important. I feel if only one day I could wake up @ 5, it would turn things around because right now it's a vicious cycle. I don't have energy because I'm not working out and I don't work out because I don't have the energy. I hope I can get to where you are real soon because I know for a fact that it makes all the difference in the world~! You sound wonderful and we all know because we've seen you in a scarf, you ARE beautiful! Keep up the good work and keep us posted. It's very motivating! Mar",

Her, her girlfriend and my boys helped with moving furniture and getting everything up from the basement. They put it up along with lights & decorations on Thanksgving eve. Thank God for that! My princess is stepping up to the plate for sure. Normally she would hang one or two ornaments while she watched the rest of us, lol. I keep putting up things little by little, but don't think I'm going to do it all as I usually do. We're going to a friends house for Christmas Eve, and I have my kids Christmas morning, but for dinner, they'll be with their dad, so it's not necessary to go as crazy as I normally would. I will also be getting my 4th treatment on Christmas Eve morning, but I usually don't feel too bad the day of or the day after. It's after my Neulasta shot that I get grounded for a couple days. I'm glad the ornament gave you a little lift and hope you get done what's most important! Love ~ Mar PS I don't see my new pic on here... I hate that.

Working out was impossible as I barely had enough strength to walk to the bathroom at times. Oh, but to get up and walk to the kitchen for food always came easy! It also didn't help that most everyone around me said it was great that I didn't lose my appetite and that gaining weight while on chemo was way better than losing. HAH! Easy for THEM to say. I gained 20 lbs! I ended chemo on Feb. 4th and am slowly getting healthier eating habits. I started exercising two weeks ago. I will be done with radiation in just three short days and am hoping that I will soon get back into shape. I guess if you think if it as temporary and make a plan for afterwards, it's all good. The MOST important thing for all of us is to be healthy!",

A friend of mine came with me to all my appts and once I got the confirmation that I had cancer, my friend insisted that the doctor write me up a script for Xanex. From then on, any type of test I went for I would ask if it was ok to take it prior to the procedure. They even said it was ok to take it the morning of my mastectomy as long as it wouldn't put me to sleep. I get extremely worked up over anything medical and this has definitely helped me get through each & every one. I had a mugascan done and was told I could take it for that and that has to do with the heart. Perhaps this would help with some of your anxiety. Also, they do these tests to make sure we will be ok under anesthesia. You are being watched very carefully and I would think they would be able to reverse any ill side effects if they should occur... I'm guessing. I don't know this for sure. Oh I sooo feel for you, Sunrae. I know & understand how stressful these stinkin tests can be. I hope you are having a lot of undue concern, like we all usually do, and that everything goes along just fine. Please take a deep breath and know that you are in God's hands.
