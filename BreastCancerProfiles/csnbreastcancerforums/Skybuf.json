Have this pain in my back (dr said kidneys) on anti biotics for it but didn't go away, see him later today and we go from there. We sure get onto things when they affect our health now. I am having another mastectomy Jan. I opted to have it as my prosthesis is way too heavy to wear, it's like saddling up a horse! yikes, and the other one, well who needs it! I hope your results come soon and all is well. Thanksgiving this weekend, we have lots to be thankful for...amen",

      "Content": "Good one coug, one we have all thought of no doubt. Dying is part of living......we all must die (unless the Rapture takes place first) Thoughts of death after ca dx come to all of us. I too try to live one day at a time. Some days are diamonds some stone as the song goes. As for me, I put all my trust, faith, hope in Jesus Christ, I am a born again Christian and couldn't make this journey without Him. I have my funeral somewhat planned and spot picked out, on the Veterans hill (hubby was a Vet) where my Mom Dad and Sister and Niece are burried. It's under a maple tree overlooking the fountain with Canadian Geese and swans in it. I won't be there but when those that knew us come to pay a visit, it's an awesome spot. My Sister and Brother in Law visit quite regular....My Mom died of several things affecting her, Dad was killed in a MVA and Sister Gail went to bed at 61 and didn't get up in the am....Niece died of an overdose at 32. Mom and daughter burried side by side.....was so sad. I will be burried from my church and have music picked out (I sing on the Praise and Worship team) I want them to sing. \"It is Well With My Soul\" I love that song and it speaks volumes. I often sing songs of Heaven and hope and pray I have the courage others have shown me when my time comes....until then, my heart will go on singingggggggg :) I cherish each day now and want to be able to help others going through the same as we are.... May God bless us and keep us all in good health!",
