    "Content": "But now I'm wishing you'd post a picture. I'm sorry you're having a hard time but just let me say \"sheesh, of course you're emotional and moody\" I think you have a right to be, we all do. I mean this is probably the toughest thing we'll ever have to go through and it's scarey. I think people distance themselves sometimes because they are scared too and aren't sure how to respond. I think giving them direction is good. Learn to come right out and say, I need help with this or that. Most people want to help but don't want to make you feel incapable or unable. Being willing to talk about what you're going through may make your friends feel it's ok to talk about it too. I've been so fortunate to have people offering to help and I think they are sincere, I just have to be willing to call them on it. As far as your sister, well, some things may be true but better left unsaid. Isn't it odd that the one who is sick often seems to be the one who has to buoey up the others?",
