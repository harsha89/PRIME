However, please don't tell people that chemo doesn't stop cancer, because for many people it absolutely works. Chemo completely eradicated my 8cm tumor. While it would be great if no one ever had to have chemo again, I don't think the vast majority of oncologists are poisoning their patients for fun and profit. Their goal is to cure cancer. Thankfully, new research is being done all the time, and I predict there will be a safer, more pleasant, and more effective treatment protocol in just a few years.",
