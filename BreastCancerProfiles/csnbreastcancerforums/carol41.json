The aggravating thing is that while being pretty much hairless, I'm still having to pluck and/or wax these wiry little chin hairs!! Where is the justice in that??",

      "Content": "Brenda Jean, I'm so glad you found this site at the beginning of your treatment. I was referred to a support group at the hospital when first diagnosed, but somehow that seemed kind of morbid to me and I tend to be a kind of private person anyway. Unfortunately, I found this site when nearing the end of Taxol after taking 31 weeks to finish what was supposed to be 15 weeks of adria/cyclo and wish I could have had all this wonderful support way earlier when I was SO discouraged. You will be blessed . . . Hang in there and don't be afraid to ask for a different nausea med if the one you are taking doesn't work . . . they have a whole arsenal out there. There really is a light at the end of the tunnel . . . I just finished day 14 of rads; only 21 more to go.",
