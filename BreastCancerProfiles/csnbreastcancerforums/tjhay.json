Roll your eyes all you want it is time for elementry school pictures. And if you cant find them, well a picture when you were elementry school age. So lets set this age group so there is no question since it has kind of gone crazy with having kids in different schools for different ages. sooooo a pic of you from age 5 throug 12. That should give you a hint of what is coming next for your challenge but that will wait for a while since i can hear you all groaning now about how goofy we all looked at that age. tj By the way i am 10 years old here",

They each after about 20 mins started to call for there moms to come to them, both of my girls came out with big old smile on there face. Now they would not tell me why but my older girl pulled her husband aside and whispered something in his ear. He left the room with a big dopey smile on his face. It wan not long after that when I was presented with 2 little boys with bald heads. It seems Daniel and Adien decided that if I could be bald so could they. You got to love the little goofballs. Been 6 months now and they keep on refusing to grow there hair back till I do. It is the funniest thing when the 3 of us go to the store, everyone just stares away at 3 baldies doing the shopping.

      "Content": "Well I have to go way back for a Thanksgiving Story that was a little different. I grew up in a Cuban family and we had black beans and rice, turkey and so forth every holiday. When I was 6 it was my mothers turn to perpare the feast. Now needless to say she was in a panic, my grandmother had trusted her white southern daughter-in-law to fix the beans. (all of my grandmas children were hoping that grandma would bring a back up batch of beans) Any way all the kids were to eat in the kitchen, and the adults in the dinning room, all the food was layed out nicely on the counter seperating dining room from the kitchen and all us kids were waiting for someone to fix the plates so we could eat. My brother Joe was sat in one of 3 high chairs which was besides the food counter, while the other babies were rounded up and the adults took their time getting to the dining room Joey decided that it was time to eat, and as we children (8 and under) watched as Joey stoot up in the highchair and climed on to the counter and headed stright for the beans. Joey was not very good with spoons yet and needless to say serving spoons were way beyond him. In a matter of minuets the walls were painted with black beans, all of the food on the counter was covered in beans, as were most of us children. Litttle Joe made quite the mess. Our dinner that day had essence of black beans, and from what we could tell the beans were quite good. Mom got 4 more years to pratice making black beans. I am thankful that i am able to be here to share this story that my brother would rather everyone forgot. I hope that you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving, that your loved ones are gathered around you, and that all the food is ready at the same time tj",

Two and a half yeas ago I was a fat girl, and I busted my butt to loose the weight managing to loose 100 lbs with diet and tons of exercise. Was dx a year ago and lost even more weight. 25 lbs to be exact. I started Tomoxifen in May. Since then I have done nothing but gain weight. I don't eat alot, in fact my nutrional levels are always to low in my blood work. I do get exercise, not as much as I did pre-treatment but I do get exercise. The weight has really started to pile on in the last month. A little weight gain is ok, but as a diabetic I really cant afford alot, for me it will cause extra health problems, esp since I gain all my weight in my belly. So anyone else experince this? Yes I do plan on talking with my dr about this on my upcomming appt. tj",

I would suggest that you find somthing to do that will force your mind to think about somthing other then your up comming treatment, read a book, do some puzzles, play a game on the computer. Honey you have every right to be concerned about your upcomming treatment, and I do realize how hard it is to not think about it. Somthing like this is frightening, it is the unknown. You have so many questions about what will happen, how you will feel, and on and on and on. It is so important for you to find that room in your mind that is your safe place, where you can go to escape all of these worries.
