I recommend it to anyone with a life threatening disease because it speaks to the fact that we can make a difference in our prognosis. Another great book is, \"Anti-Cancer\" which was written by a doctor and brain cancer survivor which tells it like it is about statistics. I attend a support group in CT with the author of \"Love, Medicin and Miracles\". His name is Dr. Bernie Siegel and he was a surgeon at Yale New Haven Hospital for many years. He was one of the first doctors to address the mind body connection. He has many, many stories about people who were written off as hopeless cases who defied the odds and lived into their 80s or 90s. One woman had every node positive and refused chemo and rads and is still alive today into her 80s. He would not have recommended that and advised her differently but his point is \"Who knows!\" I think we are better off knowing the stats.

The rest of us were in earlier stages of our diseases. I was terrified and wasn't sure I would continue. I'm glad I did. These women are spectacular and so far the women with breast cancer are doing very well. I have learned so much from them. I was raised to believe in the happy ending so when we lost a member to lung cancer after a 1 1/2 year fight, I was shocked. How could this happen? She had 3 young children and a wonderful husband. She had recommended a book to me called, \"The Shack\" which I read after her death and has helped me accept (but not like) the inevitable. We will lose people we love due to many causes...life does end in death every time. In the meantime, there is lots to enjoy. By the way when my friend was taken due to lung cancer I stayed away from the meetings for 2 weeks. I needed time to grieve in my own way. When I was ready, I went back. I hope you do too. Roseann",

      "Content": "I wouldn't be basing my decision about chemo on the cost because you can make payment arrangements with the treatment center if necessary. You life is worth whatever it takes. However as others have said, chemo decisions are generally made based on the proven effectiveness chemo has had in destroying cancer cells which may grow and kill us sometime in the future. Depending on the type of cancer we have, different chemos may be used. Chemo has come a long way in recent years although no one wants to put their body throught it. When I was first diagnosed, my husband was againt my having chemo. We had a huge fight about it because I was determined to make my decision based on science not on what people told him about chemo. When all the test results came in, it was decided that chemo would only improve my 10 year reoccurence rate by 3%, so I decided not to have chemo. Please let us know more details about the type and stage of your cancer and someone who is or was in a similar situation will be able to offer more help. PS: Concerning hair loss, the American Cancer Society offers free wigs if you can't afford one. Money wasn't an issue for me so I went online and picked out a great wig. Luckily, I never needed to order it but they have some beautiful and affordable wigs online. There is a women in my support group who had similar concerns and you wouldn't be able to tell she is wearing a wig. She sais it saves her so much time in the morning, she may wear it after her hair grows back. Roseann",

I have a friend who has been stage IV for 7 years. She is an RN and she teaches yoga! She has had setbacks along the way but they always have found a new protocol that works for quite some time while. Every year she lives is one more year for them to come up with something new. Let yourself feel down for today but please don't let a disappointment take away your hope. If the sadness lasts more than 2 weeks, let your doctors know. Chemo can cause depression and that is also treatable. Most important of all is to love yourself. Do something nice for yourself like getting a peticure or getting your hair done. Life doesn't need to be all about the cancer. Roseann",

I was diagnosed when I was being screened as a kidney donor for my son. He almost died and I was the only match. I couldn't imaging that I would ever be happy again. He was on dialysis for 3 1/2 years before I was cleared as a donor. Today is my 6 week post op checkup. We are both doing great. I tell you this because we need to know that there are blessings and not just heart ache ahead. In the turmoil, I was afraid that the bad would never stop happening.

There is a perscription creme they can give you that will help. I know many women who used it. That must be soooo painful. Don't know why you have blisters on the back of your shoulders. The techs told me that when people have radiation for other cancers it can go through to their backs. Maybe it was the angle they used to avoid your organs. I know there is an increased risk of lymphodema during radiation but I don't think it has anything to do with the burns. I don't know for sure but be sure you ask when you call.
