      "Content": "Have you taken radiation, are you taking radiation? Did anyone tell you niacin, aspirin, and breathing oxygen (through a face mask) would improve the radiation killing of solid tumors. That supplementing your diet with vitamin C, E, beta carotene, selenium, gamma linoleic acid and CoQ10 SIGNIFICANTLY improves the survival rate and quality of life in BREAST cancer patients. These supplements also decrease the side effects such as weight loss, fatigue (which can last up to one year after radiation), skin damage...AND...reduces the chances of metastases! HELLO? Did I miss Radiation 101? Did everyone else, did anyone else get any of this information? Not just, 'yeah supplements are good for you' I'm wondering did anybody sit down and say, \"Niacin, vitamin C and CoQ10 help radiation kill the tumor. Oxygen does too, so you will be wearing an oxygen mask 5 minutes prior to and during radiation.\" Just curious as to what information is generally available to all. If interested in this info go to 'Cancer Updates' and look up 'Nutrition and Radiotherapy' I haven't looked into the references yet. I did ask my RadTech about niacin and O2 today and she said, 'oh yeah, they both act as RBE's'. That is to say there is a relative biological effect seen with certain nutrients and with use of oxygen that improves the effectiveness of radiation, while decreasing the negative side effects at the same time! Glad to know this now, but you know I could have used the information 2 years ago. By the grace of God I'm here to pass along the information. Hope it helps someone. Must say before you change your diet or add supplements check with your physician first. God bless. hummingbyrd",

What I want to wear, songs to be played and final statement to friends and family. Ex always said I had to have last word. LOL Told my boys back in 2001, \"If and when I die do not be angry at God.\" 12 year old said, \"Mom, it's not IF, it's when, cause we are all going to die.\" I said, OK you're right, so IF I go before you try not to be too sad! LOL My diagnosis has been a blessing. It awakened me to the fact that today may be, and always could have been, the last day of my life. True for everybody, with or without 'the diagnosis', it's just most people don't think about it. Now that we've been slapped in the face with the reality that we were born to die we can LIVE! Each and everyday to its fullest. Do you know for certain where you are going after you die? If you have any doubt dust off the Bible ladies, that Book hasn't been around for 2003 years for nothing. Any question you have can be answered with Scripture...I tell you this because I care. More Than A Carpenter by Josh McDowell is a great book to read. The author set out to disprove Christ as the Messiah. Guess who is a Christian now? If you're going to talk about death and dying you gotta be able to mention heaven and hell. That's what's on the other side of the grave. If you know Christ as your Savior this won't offend you. I pray none have been offended. God bless. hummb And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Revelation 12:11",

Phillipians 1:21 Meaning as Christians we are to live each day to its fullest, to be a blessing to someone and to glorify the Son of God, it's what gives our life meaning and purpose. On the other hand, to die is a promotion to a higher level of life. It is being in the presence of Christ and in perfect fellowship with Him. No more worries, no more fears, no more pain, no more tears! So...to live unto Christ is to die, to die unto Christ is to live. Amazing isn't it, the circle is complete! Therefore, by the grace of God, every morning I wake up I say, \"Thank you Lord for another beautiful day. What can I do today to be a blessing to someone and to bring You honor and glory?\" Happy Valentine's Day everyone, may you all be blessed with love and joy. Marie in honor of you, 'let us rejoice for this is a day that the Lord hath made' so LIVE it to its fullest potential! God bless. hummingbyrd",

Take it all ovaries and everything. I know that may sound a bit radical, but once it's out no more periods and nothing left to worry about. My hys was the best thing I ever did. Your MD can tell how well the Tamoxifen is working by getting some blood tests (FH, FSH, LH...) this lets you know if the Tamoxifen has put you in a menopausal state. The same thing happened to me. I was on Tam for 1 year then started to break through, they wanted to give me shots but I said no and opted for the surgery. Not for everyone, but gives you something else to think about.

This person was told this site was for discussion of feelings and sharing of emotions and how \"to cope not treat\". I need to know how the rest of you feel. I shall lay it on the line with my response which is \"HOGWASH\" This site belongs to us, the cancer patients, and it is called Cancer SURVIVORS Network. It is my humble opinion that part of surviving is staying on top of cutting edge medicine, sharing experiences with others in regards to what treatment has worked and what failed and to let each other know if we hear of something new that is available. I think we are all intelligent enough to know that this is not advice given professionally and that it is our responsibility to run anything said by our physician first, most of it has to be done by order of MD anyway. So now I ask you...are we going to let administration of this site dictate to us that we cannot share medical advice, which means no responses to the previous question posted about zometa or do we take a stance and let them know we share whatever we want as long as it is morally and legally correct?

Also see you GP if u don't have stomach ulcers, diabetes, hi blood pressure or heart disease they can give u a small dose steroid injection that will knock out the sinus infection and typically raise the wbc's.

I think I told you, I hurt usually a couple of days after treatment and then about 2 weeks after treatment, but not severely. I attribute it to bone being rebuilt as I hurt at site of metastasis.

      "Content": "Maybe this will help: Can Neutropenia be Prevented? Provided by CancerConsultants Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia occurs because the chemotherapy drugs have destroyed many of the normal rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow responsible for white blood cell production. Naturally occurring substances called cytokines exist in the body to regulate certain critical functions at the cellular level. One group of cytokines is commonly referred to as blood cell growth factors. Blood cell growth factors are responsible for stimulating the cells in the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. With today?s technology, several blood cell growth factors have been discovered and manufactured in large quantities and can be administered to patients to help the recovery of bone marrow blood cell production. Prior to the development of blood cell growth factors, neutropenia commonly prevented patients from receiving their chemotherapy treatment at the full dose according to the treatment schedule. Moreover, the occurrence of bacterial and fungal infections, as well as fatalities from these infections were frequent. Doctors have long known that the administration of more chemotherapy kills more cancer cells and to kill greater numbers of cancer cells results in more patients being cured of their cancer in certain malignancies. Because neutropenia has long prevented doctors from giving full-dose chemotherapy treatment, doctors have for many years been interested in strategies that can not only reduce the severity of neutropenia once it occurs, but prevent it from occurring altogether. The Food and Drug Administration has now approved blood cell growth factors that increase the production of neutrophils, red blood cells and platelets for the treatment of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. The blood cell growth factors are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are Neupogen® (filgrastim) and Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim). In multiple clinical trials, pegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been demonstrated to reduce the severity and duration of neutropenia associated with many kinds of chemotherapy regimens. By reducing the duration and severity of neutropenia, filgrastim has been demonstrated to decrease a patient?s risk of fever and admission to the hospital for treatment of neutropenic fever. The drawback of filgrastim, however, is that it must be administered daily. In an effort to address the daily dose requirements of filgrastim, researchers developed pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim may be administered as a single dose for each chemotherapy cycle. In two clinical trials, a single dose of pegfilgrastim has been proven to be as effective as an average of 11 daily injections of filgrastim for the management of neutropenia. Use of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim after chemotherapy has also been shown to increase the likelihood that patients will receive their chemotherapy according to the treatment plan. Pegfilgrastim is generally well tolerated by patients, with minimal side effects. Approximately 1 of 4 patients treated will experience some mild aching or discomfort in their bones. Symptoms persist only while the pegfilgrastim is being used and can typically be treated with non-narcotic analgesic medicines. Sounds like Neulasta IS better than Neupogen! (((HUGS))) hummingbyrd",

Sugar feeds cancer, bottom line, and that is what burns me up....the docs don't inform their patients of this! Cruciferous veggies inhibit cancer cells growth, this includes cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, bok choy, etc...Docs don't tell you that either. I bet they also haven't told you these same veggies help tamoxifen work 30% better. Alternative medicine is grossly neglected in this country, at our expense, both financially and physically. Only 1% of our tax dollars goes to alt med research. The majority of research is dictated by the drug companies, they tell the research institutions which drugs they can research. Doesn't it strike you odd that almost ALL trials include chemotherapy, that almost ALL studies end with \"5-10 more years of research is needed before marketing will be available\". We've had \"race for the cure\", \"hope for the cure\", \"run for the cure\" this year, and I kid you not it is \"unmask the cure\". All I can say is \"about dang time\".

My position is we should be informed, and more often than not we are not informed. Now, I will say this, I have changed my dietary habits...no more 1-2 soft drinks a day, less junk food and more veggies. I even bought a juicer YUCK! still in the box, but I'm going to get it out. Nothing will gaurantee you will not get cancer again. Diet is a contributing factor; proper diet can decrease your risk for cancer and inhibit the growth OR a poor diet can provide cancer cells with a preferred medium for growth. The risk factors for cancer include family history, smoking, high fat diet, and exposure to certain environmental agents, just to name a few. My point is...if asbestos causes cancer, I think we should know so we can take precautions when working with it. Same with diet, sugar is known to feed cancer cells, they have to eat something and they happen to prefer sugar. Shouldn't we be told that? Isn't it our right to be informed? I don't know of any studies that show it causes cancer, personally don't think it does, although the by product from the process of refining sugar is pretty questionable, but that's a different can of worms. Cancer is such an overwhelming diagnosis. Most people express a feeling of such helplessness in fighting cancer. Isn't it nice to know there are some things we can do to fight cancer? I know this knowledge has given me a sense of power over my cancer, it gives me something to work on, and it gives me hope. I pray this information has helped, not hurt, others.

The NCCAM - National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine was established in 1999 to study alternative therapies for various illnesses. In 2003 they reported \"a study found that an extract from a root of a botanical called Chinese skullcap (Huang Qin) strongly inhibits cancer cell growth in the laboratory setting, especially cells present in head and neck cancers (forms of cancer typically resistent to multidrug chemotherapy).\" Now my question is what made this supplement so dangerous in less than one year. Chinese must have been using it for ages, and if one had head or neck cancer resistant to multi-chemo how could an herb be anything but worth taking a chance if it will possibly work? Anybody got any suggestions?",

Maybe I've come across to you as a narrow minded conversative, won't talk about anything but God christian? If so, I've been misrepresenting myself!
