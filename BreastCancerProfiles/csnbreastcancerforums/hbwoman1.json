    "Content": "Oh my, now I am really worried.  I just had my second radiation treatment for breast cancer.  I am so scared after reading all the posts that this is going to be very painful as time goes on.  I have 33 more treatments to go.  I am going 5 days a week for 7 weeks.  I am told to use aquaphor, aloe and to try calendula oil.  Has anyone had this many treatments without all the burning and blisters?  Now I feel like not having more treatments.",
