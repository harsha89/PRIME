      "Content": "I suppose I would go through your local hospitals, hospices, Cancer Society, etc. Would you be doing this from your home? You can put out little flyers. I've often seen flyers at the hospital for wigs and things. Do you have the book by Dr. Susan Love? There's a lot of resources listed in the back. Best of luck. Keep us posted.",

The worse thing is to carry groceries with your fingers real heavy. That ALWAYS makes my arm swell. Good luck. Let us know what happened. What kind of sting did you get exactly?",

I showed the oncology nurses and they gave me 3 different things to use as the burning progressed. Started with something like vaseline, then another creamy stuff, then the hard core, bright, bright orange stuff I had to paint on. That did the trick. Ask the nurses. They'll hook you up with their own stuff. You don't have to buy anything.",
