Well that test came back showing that I have scattered white matter in my brain, she said it is not a tumor. But never the less, I am worried. On June 15 at 2:00 I have a appointment with a neurologist. Please pray for me.",

      "Content": "I finished my treatment for breast cancer - chemo in Feb. and radiation in May 2003. Soon after I noticed that I had pain in my groin area, I went to the doctor and they did x-rays and the only thing I was told was that they could not fine anything. The pain finally went away from the groin area and now it is in my leg. Again I go to the doctor, x-rays taken again. I have also had bone scans, MRI and I was finally told that I had a lot of inflammation (arthritis). I was referred to a rheumatolgist and she has prescibed arthrotec. The medicine is supposed to be more tolerated in your stomach. Since bering treated for breast cancer it seems that my stomach cannot tolerate certain kinds of medicines. I used to be able to take Vicodin and it's upsets my stomach. I will take the medicine (Arthrotec) that the doctor prescribed and see what happens. Anyone else have the problem with pain in the legs?",
