    "Content": "Hi, the doctors office or the hospital where you had your surgery should be able to give you stores where you can buy bras.  i needed a prescription for a bra and i will be going to a local store that carries and fits the bras for you. there are also websites that have what you may like. i also have a bra from the hospital that they gave me in the mean time. i really like it. it looks very real. i thought i would have to wear different tops but i don't.   best of luck to you.",
