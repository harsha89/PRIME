I started the shampoo when there was enough to wash. My hair came in thicker than I had before I lost it.It is straight, no curl yet, I have about 2 or more inches. Stuff, does not smell really good. Kinda like medicine, but it does not stay in your hair. Oh, one more thing I used the conditioner every night. Let us know how it goes.",

My family and friends were wonderful, and you will find with some you wind up comforting them. So this site is the place to be. You will get honest answers to your questions. Some answers you may not want to here. I had a lumpectomy with 22 nodes removed 2 positive. I am her2 positive. I am currently doing chemo and then will do Rads. I learned from others here on this site to take it one day at a time. I learned that there is a lot of waiting for answers. I learned how to control my fear. I learned who my friends are. I learned how horrible everyone feels when our hair falls out. I also learned that it's all doable. You can do this, and you will have help every step of the way here with your new friends. Just except help from others there at home. Everyone heals different, so just do what you can when you can. Say No when you need to. Good luck, Hugs and prayers.",

Yesterday we were both at a Birthday party and another friend of mine blurts out about me being sick. So this friend who I did not tell starts to cry and leaves the room. So I was feeling terrible and I went to talk to her and she was crying on her boyfriens shoulder. I told her I did not mean for anyone to get hurt. Then her boyfriend who is also a friend of mine says to me \" What the hell, this is the way we find out\" and she is still crying. I said once again that I was sorry. Then I got to thinking, this was not about me this was about her. All the pointless drama. They never asked me, How I felt, what was nexted, how bad is it, nothing at all, but there upset I did not tell them. Now I know why I did not tell them.

I was afraid if I did not do chemo and have all the follow ups that go with it, that I would die. For me I made the right decision. I don't have the greatest of Insurance. Don't let money make the decision for you. First you have to take care of yourself or whatever money you have saved, you won't be around to spend it.
