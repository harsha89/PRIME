      "Content": "My son is graduating on Saturday and the ceremony is taking place in a large venue that will be hot and crowded. I'm feeling so much anxiety about going because I'm so weak and tired still from my chemo. I want to go, yet i think everyone will understand if i cant. I don't want to disappoint my son. I'm so very proud of him. I'm just afraid i will get there and start feeling bad and will have to leave while dragging others with me. Will he understand? How do you all handle important functions that you know you just cant attend and hope others will understand?",
