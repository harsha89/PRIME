      "Content": "hi there! Yes, I have had breast pain and pain in my armpit. Unfortunately, mine turned out to be cancer. I believe you have done the best thing possible which was to have a mammogram. Many things can show up on a mammogram, including calcifications and fibrous cysts both being benign (not cancer). I hope all goes well with you and you are in my prayers. The ultrasound, by the way, gives the doctors a better view of what is going on beneath the skin. Sometimes one scan or xray just isn't enough. I can tell you to try to keep your mind busy as waiting for results will drive you madly insane. God bless, Angelpie",
