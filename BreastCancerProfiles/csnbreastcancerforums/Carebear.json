    "Content": "I have recently 3.5 weeks ago had a masectomy. At that time an expander was placed. 5 days ago I had my first appt for inflation(lol) for lack of a better word. Up until that point I have been feeling great. No pain at all. Last night I felt what appeared to be 2 1/2inch in length worm shaped lumps at the lower part of chest wall.(like write at my bra line) They were also a little tender. Has anyone experienced this? Could I have torn anything by lifting more than 5lbs at work? Could I just now be feeling the expander? Just looking for a little guidance?",
