    "Content": "I would like to know if anyone has pain after a mastectomy.  I am not as fluent as everyone seems to be on this Forum so please bear with me.  I had a single mastectomy on the left side on Februrary of 2017.  My last reconstruction surgery was in September of 2017.  It is now April of 2019 and I still have stabbing pains several times a day on the left side of my breast, sometimes on the bottom.  I also have a strange feeling on the top of my breast that makes me need to push down on it.  My scar has not reduced at all.  Is this normal?  The last time I saw my Plastic Surgeon, which was about a year ago,  he said pains would be the \"new normal\".  I just had an appointment with my oncologist.  She kind of blew me off and told me to try some scar tape that she read about online.   I would appreciate it if anyone else has experienced this and let me know if their doctors said anything different.  ",
