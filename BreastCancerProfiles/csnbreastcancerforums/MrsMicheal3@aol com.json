    "Content": "Hi, Laura! Happy to finally find you to be able to tell you thank you for your response to my post. I often wonder if it takes forever for someone to SEE my posts. It took forever for me to get in here, in the first place, and now that I have and thanked a bunch of people.....no one has returned anything to me, so I wonder, too!! That's why I told people it was okay to just email me. And proabably wayyyy easier. :-) Anywayyy.....just saw my oncologist last week, and so far, so good!!! Yippeeeee! My blood looks good, but he is sending me for another mammogram in Sept. on the right side. Still have a lot of mixed emotions about my missing breast. Can't afford the reconstruction, right now, and not sure I want one, anyway. Any ideas? And how did you find that one place where you volunteer? That sounds like something I'd be interested in and something that would help me. Also....lol..sorry, I tend to go into novels, also! Just to set the record straight....although I DO appreciate all of the good advice from everyone. We are NOT destitute! My husband was temporarily \"fired\" for 30 days for a stupid thing he did. He's back to work, sporadically, like everyone, but we do have some savings that we were living off of. And he was doing work on the sidel. I guess I just freaked out because of everything ELSE, ya know? Before this cancer took my brest, I was tough, and could handle pretty much anything. I'm beginning to get back there, a little, since I was finally able to get through here and my best friend sent me a book about breast cancer... Stepping into the Ring\" by Nicole Johnson? Great read and short. But helped me, immensely! So, again, thanks and happy I was finally able to get through to SOMEONE who had posted to me. Donna N.",
