    "Content": "My surgeon decided to get all my tests, CT scan, Body scan, MRI, Labs and whatall done in one day. The nurse who gave me the barium was very informative, she even mentioned that it may cause dirrhea and that the restroom was right around the corner, sweet. So I got through the MRI, no problems. However, during the body scan BURUMP! Since anything that can give you diarrhea, will give me the toots, I took the precaution of putting on a sanitary pad, good thing, but it still stunk to high heaven. Ahh yes, good times, good times.",
