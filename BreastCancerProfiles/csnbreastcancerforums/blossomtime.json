      "Content": "I finished all treatment in March and it has taken forever to grow back. Finally started going without wig in mid October but it is still quite thin on top. But it also came back curly and soft. The texture on top quite different from the rest. Some days I am still not very comfortable with it, but at least it is hair and it is all mine. LOL",

      "Content": "My heart goes out to you, what you are going through is our worst fears come true. I had a bone scan before the start of chemo only because my liver function tests elevated after surgery. At that time they decided they should do full workup, bone scan, abd ct,etc. This was even after knowing I had 6 positive nodes and am her 2 pos, 3+. But since they have been very vigilant. I have had another bone scan a brain ct and an MRI. I am 18 months out from diagnosis. But I feel that with this disease I will never stop worrying. That 5 yr mark is a nothing more than a 5 yr date. It might be 1yr,2,5,10,15 or never. One just doesnt know so I am trying to move on with living every day. I bought a house while finishing treatment and take great joy in making improvements. I understand the guilt feeling. When I was diagnosed I was 4 months late on my mammogram, ironically the first time I have ever been late and was never very good about self exams. My tumor was 4.2x4.5 cm. Boy did I beat myself up over that for a long time. But I had to move on, whats done is done. Even though I can understand your anger at your drs, try to move on for your own well being. We are here for you to vent. I will keep you in my prayers. Sharon",
