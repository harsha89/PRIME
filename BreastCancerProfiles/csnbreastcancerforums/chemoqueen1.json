      "Content": "Hurray for you 1/2 way through! I just finished Cheom on 7/25/03 I had Taxotere and Carboplatin. From what I understand the Taxotere should be a lot easier to deal with. I too wonder how they will know that I reamain cancer free. I was node neg and had a lumpectomy. I start Radiation the week of August 18th. I would think that if you ask to have a CT scan, Bone Scan etc to assure yourself that you are still cancer free they should be able to do that for you.",

Herceptin has been proven to shrink & significantly slow down tumors that have spread to other areas of the body. It is hoped that using Herceptin along with Standard Chemo in women who have NOT had spread beyond the breast will prevent a re-occurrence. http://www.chemoangels.com This is a web site where you can sign up to get a your very own \"Chemo Angel\" your Chemo Angel will send you a card every week.
