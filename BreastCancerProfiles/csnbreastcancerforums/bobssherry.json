    "Content": "Hang in there Grandma (& Grandpa too). Keep telling your oncologist exactly what hurts, how long it has hurt, everything. The old saying \"the squeeky wheel gets the grease\" is true. If your feeling bad let them know until they provide something to make you feel better. I had my last chemo 2 weeks ago. Good luck!! BobsSherry",
