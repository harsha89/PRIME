      "Content": "I think I understand where the Administration is coming from with their concerns. They may be worried that this kind of info could degenerate into \" quackism\" and there are people on this site that are desperate and sometimes looking for anything that might work. I don't think that they want to be responsible for someone following what might be seriously bad advice that they got on this site. It may not so much be about what your friend posted as the potential for postings of this kind to get out of hand. wimpy",

      "Content": "Hi I am alarmed that this discussion has gone so strongly into a diet discussion that recommends eating in a totally unbalanced way. I think this could be scary to people who are afraid their eating behaviour will cause them to have a reoccurrence of cancer. I just want to point out that if you are suggesting that the goal should be to totally remove sugar from the diet because you believe it to be some sort of \"killer\" than that goal is nigh onto impossible to attain. If you read any of the labels on your food in the supermarket you will discover that virtually all foods have sugar added to make foods taste better. Again, the sugars in the fruits and vegetables that you eat are eventually broken done into smaller bits in your body and sucrose is one of the components that appears in the breakdown chain. Everything that I have read indicates that the medical establishment is not certain about contributing factors for cancer development. For each study that says don't drink alcohol there is a study that says alcohol in moderation is OK and red wine may discourage the development of certain cancers. For each food study that says don't eat something there is a study that contradicts it. The only recommendations that are widely accepted are the studies suggesting that ER+ tumor people should lower fat intake and eat fewer foods that can contribute to estrogen mimicking or estrogen production in their bodies. What I am suggesting here is that maybe you should just eat healthfully and eat in moderation. People who are already terrified should not be led to be totally terrified of what they are eating. Some risk factors can not be avoided. After all, lots of us live in a city and drive in traffic where we breathe polluted air every day. Lets try to be calm and enjoy life and not analyze every single thing.",

      "Content": "Hi I forgot to mention that I believe that the concern about always drinking distilled water is that it does not contain the minerals necessary to contribute to a healthy mineral balance in the blood. When we sweat we lose sodium from the body in the sweat and the sodium naturally present in water we drink replaces the sodium lost. Since distilled water is greatly mineral reduced we will not be getting the minerals from this water to keep the blood properly balnced between Na+ and K+.",
