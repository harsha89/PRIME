      "Content": "I finished my treatment three months ago. Lately, I've noticed that my teeth are extremely sensitive. Is this yet another side effect of chemo? I know that it targets rapidly dividing cells which is why I had to take the Neulasta shots (ouch) but should it effect my teeth? Just curious. I have a dental appt next Wednesday so I want to be informed.",
