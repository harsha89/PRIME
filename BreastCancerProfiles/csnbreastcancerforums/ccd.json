    "Content": "I am 3 weeks post mastectomy, still having pain but getting a bit better everyday. Before my surgery it was discovered that my CA125 (uterine cancer marker) was slightly elevated. My Mother currently has uterine cancer (she's 88 and doing GREAT!) so I had an ultra sound done. A complex cyst was seen on my right ovary...so now that the breast cancer is taken care of (DCIS with no invasion) I have opted for a complete hysterectomy. I want to get everything out so I won't have to spend time wondering if something is going on inside me. However the thought of yet another surgery and recovery is so depressing! I am having a really hard time with all of this...1 Thanks for letting me vent!!",
