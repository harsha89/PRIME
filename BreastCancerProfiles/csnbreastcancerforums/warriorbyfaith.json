    "Content": "I'm heading into the Reconstruction World/Phase of my life next. From meeting with my plastic's doctor, I do not believe you need to have your port removed. Your Oncologist will want it there until you complete the HER2 chemo. Please note...depending on the type of your port - they may not use it during surgery and may need to give you an IV instead. Best Wishes & God Bless",
