    "Content": "25 years ago Chemo was a lot rougher on your body. My mom was set up for four rounds. The gave her the first one, but doubled the amount without telling her. So, after the third round of Chemo, she said: \"I'd rather die than go through that again. Just let me go.\" Well, she was dead about three days later. I have been very conscious of what she said, but I know that Chemo back in 1982 was very different than Cheno in 2009. Keep hoping for anything good to happen like I do. Hope for a better treatment/cure and things like that. Good things. And Good Luck. Lisa",
