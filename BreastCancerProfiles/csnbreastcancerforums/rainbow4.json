      "Content": "I'm on Arimidex, had a diagnosis of osteopenia before the bc came along. I'm taking the generic Fosamax, and also 1500mg of calcium with D3. I had a bone density scan before I started the Arimidex and was told that I'll have one yearly as long as I'm taking the Arim. I'll be very interested in seeing what difference, if any, that the extra load of calcium and the Arimidex are making. I'm sure stiff since starting the Arim. (hips, feet & hands mainly). -rainbow4",

Thank you, thank you Marlene_K (at least I think that's who it's from; the note inside tells the sender's \"real\" name, and I'm guessing she is the sender). If not, please let me know and I'll do some more investigating. The ornament is a beautiful glass pink ribbon with my name added in gold sparkles. I love it and will hang it proudly on my tree for MANY years to come! -rainbow4 (Barb)",

      "Content": "What an excellent suggestion - I wish I'd remembered about CaringBridge a few months ago. The 14-year-old daughter of a good friend had bone cancer a few years ago, and that's how they kept everyone informed on what was going on. I'd have used it for myself after dx in April, when everyone was asking. Now I'm past lumpectomy & sentinal lymph node disection, 7 weeks of radiation, and began Arimidex a month ago, and everyone thinks I must be \"healed\". Almost no one seems to inquire anymore. Maybe this is just the Arimidex talking - sorry for the \"poor me\" attitude today.",
