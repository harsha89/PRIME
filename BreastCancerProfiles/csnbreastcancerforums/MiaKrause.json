    "Content": "The Center for Reconstruction in New Orleans is SO helpful! You owe it to yourself to at least visit their website and look at what they are doing. I just hate the thought of muscle getting cut out of your body if you don't have to go that way. The Center for Reconstruction helps make travel plans, offers a place right in the hospital for patient' families to stay and even meets you at the airport to bring you to the facility- also returns you to the airport after surgery. It may be a hassel to travel- but I live in Pennsylvania and I stumbled on them through my own quest to find a reconstruction that didn't seem more destructive than beneficial... and I am traveling to New Orleans this July to have my breasts rebuilt. ( I am 37 and had surgery this December to have my breast removed....) They are very helpful and accomadating... you could just check them out. Mia",
