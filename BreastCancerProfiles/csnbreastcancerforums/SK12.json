      "Content": "Hello.  I was lurking about to find some info. Maybe this will also help others later. I had 4 rounds of chemo, mastectomy, another 3 rounds of taxol, and now two weeks into radiation. Like I need any more side effects, but here we go. I have dealt with everything head on, even with a smile, but was dreading radiation.  I have Aquaphor, Vit E, aloe, baby wash, infant washcloths, and large soft shirts. I started to see changes to the affected area. Praying it doesn't get bad to the point of blisters.  could you share what happened to you during radiation therapy and how you resolved the issue?",

      "Content": "I got done with my AM rounds of TX. We went to a local diner afterwards for breakfast. A sweet older couple sat near us.  The lovely lady (mind you, she's wearing a pink t-neck), saw me, had a sad look, and started to sob.  Bless her heart. I just want to go over to her and hug her to reassure HER that I'm ok.  Maybe she's a survivor?  Just wanted to tell her, NO REALLY, I'M OK.  LOL  speedy recovery to you all",
