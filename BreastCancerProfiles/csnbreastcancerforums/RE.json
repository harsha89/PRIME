      "Content": "Ohilly, I can understand your emotions but please do not let her cancer become your stressor. It saddens us greatly to see anyone lose the battle with cancer, but to have it chronicled for us and see her struggle so personally portrayed is heart wrenching. That said Ohilly, her battle is not you path. Like you said you are a stage 1 and there is great success for survival for you. I say this to you from personal experience, you see I lost my mom to cancer (she fought it for 26 years) and my sister (8 year battle). It was my sister's death that struck me in a way that surprised me. I had just finished treatment and was just getting my hair back so I was super sensitive at the time. I saw my onco a few weeks after she passed and he knew immediately that for the first time since my cancer battles had begun some ten years previous I was down trodden. My onco knew why and before I could express my feelings he strongly told me that my sister's cancer was not my cancer and what happened to her was not necessarily going to happen to me. He then went on to remind me that I have beaten cancer three times and I am doing well. Ohilly, you too have beaten cancer, you too are doing well, you too are a survivor, you too have a future to live and enjoy please do not let cancer have that too. Enjoy and revel in your current healthier state, in your new hair, and the fact that you are getting stronger each and everyday. I agree cancer is a horrible illness, but it can be beat and you are on that path my friend, keep your chin up and know we are here for you! RE",

My guy and I have not gone to any of our reunions, lets see it has been 35 years for us. Okay now the rads, did you have rads previously? Be sure to take super good care of your skin, pat dry never rub after a shower, another thing that you can do while having radiation is to lightly dust the radiated area with corn starch (yes the stuff in your kitchen.) I was instructed to made a corn starch dust ball of sorts using cheese cloth or a stocking (sock) tying off the end. This really worked well as it made it easy to apply lightly. The cornstarch helps to keep the radiated area from chafing. Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing as well, chin up it will be over in no time! Gentle Hugs, RE",

In regards to the taste bud problem, it you are referring to having a metal type of taste in your mouth I found it helpful to use sturdy plastic forks in lieu of metal ones to help relieve some of that nasty taste and allow a bit of food flavor in. I know it is not what you are asking but when I read your title I felt compelled to tell you that once treatment is over you can expect to gradually get back to living life and enjoying it as you seem to be doing in your picture. Cancer has been a part of my life since I was 17 when my mom got it (I got it at 40) but I learned from her and others that even though we are changed by cancer we can still be happy, loved and active people after wards.

I don't have my med papers with me but i am pretty sure I had both of those (along with a few others LOL!) You are going to be scared and that is perfectly normal, please pray or meditate a few moments before going in to relax yourself. Some people like to visit with other patients for me I preferred to listen to music and go to sleep during the treatment. Bring a good book, favorite blanket, crossword book whatever helps to ease your mind and gives you comfort. Be sure to be aware of how you are feeling and if something seems odd to you ask the nurses so they can explain things to you, DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS! They are usually great at helping you relax a bit. Drink a lot of fluids the day of treatment and rest up. I agree you will most likely not feel ill the first day but by the end of the second day or the start of the third you may feel like you have a bad flu. I do not know how many treatments you are scheduled for, I had 6 the first time and had a bit more difficult time rebounding after each treatment. Please be kind to yourself and rest as often as needed, eat when you are feeling hungry and get out in the sunshine from time to time as it is good for the mind. I would also suggest keeping a note pad nearby to jot down any concerns you have that you may want to ask your doctor because you are most likely going to get chemo brain during treatment which causes us to be quite forgetful so a note pad is a lifesaver. Be sure to take it with you to your appointments so you do not forget to get answers to your concerns. Also do not hesitate to call your doctor once you are home if you star to feel poorly as there are things they can do to help ease your discomfort. Take care and let us know how you are doing, RE",

It is okay though JoJo because you are still here and there is just more of you to adore! Keep working on beating the beast you can work on the battle of the bulge once you are over this battle, like I said it took me 12 years but I have finally shed most of those pounds and even if I had never done so the fact that I am still here is worth 70 lbs.

Different cancers have different times to them based on their behavior. With breast cancer you can never really say a woman is cured no matter how long It has been so it is important to be diligent you keep on top of things.\" I hope this was helpful, it cleared things up for me as I have never felt like after 5 years I was good to go.

I put it off for 4 years, then I lost my mom to ovarian cancer after she had fought breast cancer twice. That was enough for me. I was obviously quite sore for several weeks, the menopause problems were much less than I had anticipated! At first I cried easily, I would even cry at emotional commericals. The emotions settled down after about 3 months, I also had the problems with hot flashes so I had a lot of fans going and I would apply ice packs to cool me down. Since I too have had breast cancer hormones are not an option for me. As far as your femininity goes that did not change for me either. I am still just as girlish as I ever was and have truly not felt any change to who I truly am. Wishing you well, RE",

      "Content": "Okay here's the deal, lets all share a Thanksgiving memory that we hold dear. I posted this last year, however since there are many new folks here I shall repeat it...here goes. A couple of years back we all decided to gather in the desert for Thanksgiving at my sister in-laws house in honor of her (she had passed several weeks earlier). We decided none of us wanted to cook so we pre ordered our dinner from Safeway, sounds easy right? Well, we weren't in a hurry to eat so we put off picking it up until 3:00 Thanksgiving day just before they closed (I know I can hear you shouting \"Are You Nuts\", perhaps . Any who, we picked up our meal hungry and excited to get home and eat it. When we walked in the house the guys had lovingly set the table (or perhaps they did it because they wanted to eat right away) seeing this we decided to serve it up. We figured we would have to reheat a few things so we got right to it, ha guess what.....EVERYTHING was frozen! Yup, you read right FROZEN SOLID! Oh my we now had to figure out what was the fastest way to thaw mashed potatoes, stuffing, pumpkin pie, an entire turkey and green bean salad with just one medium microwave. I boiled water and we had dishes of hot water with floating potatoes, pies, stuffing etc inside. Now, let me defer from that for a moment because the Thanksgiving fun did not end there. My sister in-law raised miniature pinchers and had a kennel in the back yard. Well, it was time to feed the little guys and to our horror one of them shot out of the kennel like a rocket. Suddenly every adult was in the yard cooing and calling this tiny dog and he was having none of it, off he ran through the fence. To explain the difficulty here she lives in the desert with wide open spaces filled with tumble weeds and coyotes beyond her gates. My niece is out the gate in her stocking feet keeping an eye on where he goes and the guys are on quads trying to herd him back home, trust me these are not cowboys! Finally the little guy returns to the confines of the property and once again they are perplexed on how to get him back in his cage. My husband and his brother go back to their kid rabbit catching days and put some meat in his cage and attach a string to the cage door, once he went for the meat WHAM they yanked on a fishing pole they had attached to the gate handle, the door was shut and he was safe once again. Poor little thing was exhausted, he got a bit more treats that night and a pedicure to ensure he had not hurt his paws. Okay, back to the frozen meal. As I read the instructions on how to prepare this meal I discovered although it was cooked it still required an hour in the oven to complete the process AHHHHH! Mind you this all started at 3:00, we finally sat down to dinner at 8:00. Don't worry we didn't miss our dessert; we just ate it first and had the main course last. All this said I am thankful for my faith, family (extra thankful for the 3 grand children) and friends. I am thankful for my health, a roof over my head, I am thankful for all of you here who so freely show how much you care. And of course I am tremendously thankful for my husband who has never wavered in his love and support of his rather goofy wife. HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO EACH OF YOU! HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT ONE! ♥ RE ♥",

I have mine yearly (or more often is there appears to be a problem) and it is painful because the one breast is dense and tight from the surgery and the radiation. I realize this is difficult for you however, it is necessary for the doctors to be able to find any future cancers as early as possible. Perhaps you could express your feelings to your doctor or the nurse, they may be able to give you meds that will take the edge off when you go in for your mamogram. I agree that Ultrasounds may be another option for you that you should discuss with your doctor. My best to you, I wish you well! RE",

Now that said the 6 weeks I have been coming here have been great and I will keep coming. Let me see what kind of gal am I. I am a Christian first, wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend. I love animals and have four myself, I love to make folks laugh, I enjoy singing, photography, camping, riding my quad and going out with friends. I have been told I am analytical, I see myself as a kind person, I adore children as they seem to refresh the soul with their antics. I love to write letters and have several pen pals. Okay that is all I can come up with. This was refreshing Joyce, thanks for the post and have a wonderful day. Rena",

      "Content": "Today I went to see my reconstruction surgeon so we could evaluate how things are coming along (notice I said \u201cWE\u201d). Well if you have followed my other reconstruction posts you will recall he and I had discussed some sanding (remember the car ref) to smooth a few rough edges out. Now in addition to that I wanted to know what is needed to reconstruct a nipple and areola for my new breast. He said it is a pretty simple thing to do, but it does involve grafting from the lower area of my belly (don\u2019t worry I have enough to spare). This skin is circular and it is grafted around the nipple and skin and bandages will be sutured into me around the new nipple he will create for me. I was told that sometimes this type of graft will darken on its own and look quite natural so tattooing will not be needed, we shall see. In addition to that I have noticed that when I lay down the new breast tends to slide a bit to the side (how odd is that). He stated that that sometimes occurs with big breasted women (trust me I was not that big breasted) so he is going to go in while he is doing all this other stuff and resucture that side to reinforce it to better stay where it is supposed to be which will help it to better stay where it is supposed to be. The whole thing should take a little over two hours. I do not have a date yet but it will be soon, I\u2019ll keep you all updated. Hugs to all, RE",

You Mimi are a bright, beautiful young woman who like the rest of us has had her world thrown askew, you my dear are as normal as any of your friends you think are having pity for you. When you get these thoughts remember how hard you have fought to get where you are and know that this battle has made you a stronger, more sensitive soul. I in no way intend to imply that cancer is good for us because we come out of it with a greater sense of the value of our lives, but somehow we do see things much more clearly. Give it time Mimi you are all you were before and more, do not let cancer steal your happiness it does not deserve it. You are not the poor pathetic sick one, no one knows what secrets we each hold they have their problems as well so hold your head high in the knowledge that you are the strong, intelligent young woman who battled cancer and came out the other side with a host of pink pals who will rally at her side at any given moment you only need to only ask! Now all that said I totally agree with Judy, tell your doctor they may certainly be able to help you and of course who doesn't love a spa treatment! Hugs, RE",

Cancer is indeed a challenge but certainly not one you cannot rise to. It seems when one hears one has cancer there is a re-evaluation of what is important, one does not usually set out to make a list of the important things they just seem to come more into focus. In regards to the mastectomy I think we all react differently, you may find that you are not disturbed by it and you may find that seeing yourself looking so different from what you are used to is a bit dis-concerning either way we will be here for you. I have had a lumpectomy on one side and a mastectomy on the other, I recently completed the reconstruction after more than three years and find that for me it was important. Body image is different for each person. Do you know if you will be having chemo or radiation treatments? If you do there are a lot of tips that can be shared with you . One important tip I will mention is that if at all possible you may want to have someone go to your doctor appointments with you to help you remember it all as there is a lot of information being given and many times it can become a tad over whelming so a second set of ears does help. I truly wish you all the best, RE",
