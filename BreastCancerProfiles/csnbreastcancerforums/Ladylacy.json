    "Content": "My sister was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer 12 years ago.  She underwent chemo and radiation and then a lumpectomy.  She didn't want her breast removed so she opted for the lumpectomy.  They had to take more than planned but she has been cancer free since then.  Her doctor does follow her every 6 months due to her cancer being triple negative. I would definitely get a second opinion.  My husband died from cancer recently and when first diagnosed we didn't go with a second opinion.  Something I regret very much to this day because I think maybe the outcome would have been different.  We did get a second opinion after being told he was clear but within 2 months he was having problems again and needed an emergency trach and second biopsy which showed the cancer had returned.  When referred to a specialist we were told the tumor never went away and surgery should have been done first because there was no spread to lymp nodes or any where else in his body.  So second and even third opinions should be gotten, my opinion. Wishing you and yours peace and comfort.",
