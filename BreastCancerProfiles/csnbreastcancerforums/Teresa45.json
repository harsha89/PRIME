    "Content": "Hello, I am sorry that you are going through this. I just wanted to share my experience. Maybe it will help. I started being short of breath when doing any activity. (Dishes, getting ready for work, any walking) My husband noticed before I did about 4 months ago. I finished FAC on December 28, 2010, Taxol (12 treatments) April 15, 2011. Once it became noticeable to me in my everyday activity (about 2 months, I started with a dry asthma cough) While taking a walk with my Friday a couple of weeks ago, I noticed she was not even breathing hard and I was huffing and buffing. I told my dr about it and he did a lung x-ray. It came back that I had interstitial changes (lung disease) I spent a week scared to death. When to see a lung specialist yesterday. He ran a ct to confirm his findings but he thinks it was my new implants that the radiologist thought was a lung disease. He thought my shortness of breath is asthma. He said that the chemo can cause the asthma. He told me that he had a patient once that had only had two treatments when she was in his office with asthma symptoms. You could have the same problem. I hope this helped you some way. Teresa",
