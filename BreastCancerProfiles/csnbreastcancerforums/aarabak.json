    "Content": "I have now had the same procedure done twice. Once for bc 5 years ago and once for bc a year ago. I always experience that tightness. Some days are worse than others. You appear to be doing the right thing. Since the implants sit on top of the muscle that is going to happen. I used to carry my stress/tension/tightness in my neck and shoulders, now I am more aware of it because I also now feel the muscles behind the implants. Just be careful with deep tissue massage if you have any type of lymphedema. Good luck. Let me know if you find something that works. Muscle relaxers might help.",
