    "Content": "I have just recovered from the shingles and was prescribed Lyrica after the boils have disappeared but the symptoms still exist (pain and burning). It has been a godsend, The pain from the shingles has decreased 100% and I am back to work. This is my second time around with breast cancer, I am battling metastatic breast cancer which is in my hip area, thus the reason for contracting the shingles (taking anti-cancer drugs, low resistance, etc.). I was also told the Lyrica could be used to treat neuropathy. The only side effect is a little bit of drowsiness in the beginning, I would truly recommend it. Good luck and hope you are feeling better by the time you read this.",
