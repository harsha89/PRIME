    "Content": "Hello everyone, I'm a new member here, and could use some friendship/support. I'm scheduled for a \"simple\" mastectomy (no reconstruction at this time) on the 12th. I've known about this for a few months, but now that it's almost here, the reality is hitting hard. With the holidays that come with the end of the year, I admit that I put it out of my mind for a while - I guess that was my coping mechanism for the time being - denial. That was dumb on my part because here I am - 5 days away and now I am freaking out. I keep telling myself at least it's not a limb or my sight that I'm losing - I know it could be far worse that what it is. And I know there are many, many brave others who've been through this before - so in a way I feel that I've no right to whine. But at the same time, it's so incredibly personal and a painful thing to face emotionally. The part that bothers me is that it's so permanent, and that part of me will never be the same again. I'd feel better if I knew the feeling/sensation (NOT sexually - just in general) in my chest would return over time - but I know better. And the stories I've read about on/off shooting pain in the area after surgery...does not sound pleasant. Anyway, thanks so much for listening/reading my rant. Any words of wisdom/advice/tips on coping/personal stories - anything - would be deeply appreciated. Thanks Much! Christine :)",
