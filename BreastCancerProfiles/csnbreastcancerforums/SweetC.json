    "Content": "Hi, I had a mastectomy in July 2005. I am in the process of reconstructive surgery now. I had DCIS that had started to infiltrate. After doing extensive research on my type of cancer where there were no lymph nodes affected, I decided not to take chemo. I am currently on tamoxifen. I will be having the exchange tomorrow, getting the tissue expander out and the implant in. I am a little nervous of course. I want to know has anybody else decided not to get chemo due to the lymph node negative results?",
