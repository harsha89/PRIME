    "Content": "Dee, also go to YouTube and search for how to tie headscarf, chemo scarves how to, etc.  i got a lot of tips from that and now get compliments on the scarves i wear.  it really is easy to tie them when you wtch someone else do it.  i have found that the caps make my head sweat and become uncomfortable after a little while, making me want to just yank it off in the middle of my dr's waiting room or a restaurant. Scarves, however are more breathable and soft on my old head, and according how i tie them can be adjusted with thickness and warmth, or thinness and coolness.  I prefer the longer ones that are little more than a foot wide.  Watch the videos on YouTube, there are several, and you will see many different kinds used.     Good luck and i hope your treatments go well!    JoAnn",
