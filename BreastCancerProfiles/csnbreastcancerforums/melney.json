    "Content": "I had a mastectomy in March and was out of work for 2 weeks. I work as a court clerk, so it wasn't too physically demanding. My drain was also out after about a week. You can either pin your drain to your clothes or get a wonderful cami from Amoena (sold at Nordstrom's or online) that has removable pouches for the drains and comes with a soft prosthesis to be worn now and balance out your silhouette. You will get tired - the naps are a necessity. Give yourself time and don't push it. You'll thank yourself in the end.",
