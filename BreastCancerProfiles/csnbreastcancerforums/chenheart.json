      "Content": "Have you contacted your local ACS office? That is a great place to start! As far as groups go, the bulletin boards at my oncologist's office waiting room are chock full of info about groups. And BC seems to be the largest group represented. You might want be able to find something similar...even if you do not have to go through chemo and/or radiation. Good For You, btw! That is wonderful!!!! Mixed reviews about support? I think it is all about finding the right group, something that suits you, your personality and your changing needs. Much like a book club. And, if there is no group, or you are looking for something more specific, again, as with book clubs~ Start Your Own!! You might be just what others are looking for! Hugs and Good Luck! Claudia",

It actually feels bruised, tho nothing is visible on the outside. I have had mammograms, ultrasounds, MRI's and there is nothing \"wrong\". So...I don't worry too much about the discomfort anymore. Well, not every day, anyway! LOL Do contact the ACS~ they may help you to put your mind at ease. Keep us posted! hugs, Claudia",

I am from the hippie child era~a teenager in the 60's, but I was never interested nor a participant in the \"drug culture\" even though back then, and especially in Europe, where I was living, it wasn't illegal. It just never called my name... Now, with cancer, I know it is often used for its various pain relieving properties. I am not completely insolated or isolated, and can indeed recognize the tell-tale aroma of pot. I have had opportunity to use it while going through chemo...but guess what? I am allergic to even the smell of it! So, it has NO medicinal properties to me! LOL I get physically ill if I even smell it, and I am not willing to ingest it in cookies or brownies, even though I have heard ( and do believe) that when it is an added ingredient, it changes the chemical component I may be allergic to. I am just too gun shy to give it another try. Or so I say now! Who knows? With my recurrance and mets, perhaps I will be inclined to see how/if it works. Hugs, Chen♥",

The only reason my 50' photo is on CSN is because someone sent it to me, I forwarded it to someone else, I sent them my CSN password so that they could post it for me! I'm not kidding! Reggie got me an ipod for my birthday~ his daughter loaded it for me, and I have never ever used it...and that was 8 months ago!( shhhhhh he doesn't know that!!!) I keep it out, and move it to one corner of the dresser or another so he thinks I am using it, but I never have! I am still a transistor radio kinda gal~I actually sleep with ear-buds so that I can hear jabbering and news/talk radio all night...an ipod? I would go nutser ( is that a real word?

I cannot believe the things you have gone through in the past few years~ your own battle with BC, as well as the personal tragedies you have been a part of. You are an amazingly strong, compassionate woman, and I am so inspired that you never sit back and watch Life~ you stand up and make decisions. Not an easy task, but you see things with both your heart and mind, and you take action. You are wondering if you did the right thing, and that you would hate to break up a family. Of course you did the right thing~ and NO! No! No! you did not break up a family, no matter how this turns out, you may have saved one! For myriad reasons, his daughter has probably needed extensive therapy for a long, long time. It has obviously been ignored ~ her father was physically unable to care for her, and from how you have described her mother, the emotional needs were not met either. I don't have any idea if this saddest of human dramas will have a \"Happy Ending\"~but you absolutely did the right thing~ and may have saved a life. Or two. Let your heart be at peace. Hugs, Chen♥",

No need to be redundant when stating the obvious!!!!! Hugs, Chen♥ PS Two reasons having friends is nice: You can click on your friends list and see if they are online when you are, and it makes sending them emails much easier too, with the friends drop down list!

Holland is really the name of the country in it's closest translation, anyway! Whereas most everyone else would ask a person from the Netherlands how to say something in \"Hollandish\"...it was and now remains the misinformed Americans who ask how to say something in \"Dutch.\" This has been assimilated into the language/culture so that it seemingly belongs there! Thus, the people in Holland speak Dutch...even though they really don't and never have~ unless they were speaking German! Confused????? LOL",

I can pretty much gauge how much sleep I am getting by which talk-show host I am listening to at any given hour!

Of course there are the \"tricks\" we can use when we are alone, but they truly work/help. Park farther away from the entrance to the market, use stairs instead of elevators, and one I lie is, use a salad plate insead of a dinner plate for portion control! One of our Kindred Spirits, \"A Different Ballgame\" joined Weight Watchers and not only did she post her starting weight, she lets us know every Monday her weight loss and how much she walked that week. It, I imagine keeps her on track knowing that she has made a personal commitment to tell ALL OF US how she is doing! She impresses me greatly! My sister recently joined WW online, but honestly, I don't know how seriously commited she is to it; her Ladies Only gym membership is going unused as well. Sigh...

I also drank lots of water during both chemo and radiation. And as for body care~ I got a natural sponge and some liquid Aveeno body wash. It is water and oatmeal based with no dyes or perfumes which obviously could irritate radiated skin. I saturated the sponge with water, added the Aveeno, and squeezed the bubbly lather over my affected area, NEVER rubbing the skin. I patted it dry, gooped on the Aquaphor, wore no bra, and donned a big, soft T-shirt. Thankfully I had an in-home job caring for an elderly pre- alzheimers pt, and I could dress casually!

I realize that there is a poster who, due to her own cancer journey, is not very, shall we say, Pink friendly! She makes no bones about her stance, and she sometimes makes me wince, since I am stage 4 with mets. If this is the person in question, I am not sure. But I don't know who or what the CAPS is referring to. I did send a PM to one of the Kindred Spirits, who was very concerned about the negativity this person was generating. I suggested that she flag the post as flags are anonymous in nature, and give the site administrator ( AKA Greta) the opportunity to read what any of us finds offensive, and take decisive action if needed. Being flagged may seem drastic, but there is often no other way to alert Greta...it also doesn't mean that anyone will be automatically banned from the site. What I think is offensive you may not and vice versa! This simply gives Greta a heads up so that she can be made aware of anything potentially disruptive. (I was going to say I didn't know anyone cared if I was wearing a cap while typing~ but I really need a shampoo and didn't have time today yet! To be on the safe side, I got rid of the cap and am moving on and am over having to hide my less than perfect coiffeur!! LOL) The anonymity of the boards sometimes spills over into being almost without boundaries...as mentioned, we are fighting for our lives. Our emotions, including the frustration, fear, and freeness to vent can certainly color our posts now and again.

Tears that you can't make it all go away, tears of frustration, and even tears of gratitide that you can be a part of each others' lives. Lead with your heart, sweet sister, knowing all the while that both of you are surrounded by a nurturing family of cyber-sisters ready to cushion you and give you courage. Hugs, Chen♥",

When mother and new baby came home from the hospital, Johnnie's family was invited over to see the baby. Before they left their house, Little Johnnie's dad had a talk with him and explained that the baby had no ears. His dad also told him that if he so much mentioned anything about the baby's missing ears or even said the word ears, he would get the smacking of his life when they came back home. Little Johnnie told his dad he understood completely. When Johnnie looked in the crib he said, \"What a beautiful baby.\" The mother said, \"Why, thank you, Little Johnnie. Johnnie said, \"He has beautiful little feet and beautiful little hands, a cute little nose and really beautiful eyes. Can he see?\" \"Yes\", the mother replied, \"we are so thankful; the Doctor said he will have 20/20 vision.\" \"That's great\", said Little Johnnie,\"coz he'd be screwed if he needed glasses\".",

I realize that there is a poster who, due to her own cancer journey, is not very, shall we say, Pink friendly! She makes no bones about her stance, and she sometimes makes me wince, since I am stage 4 with mets. If this is the person in question, I am not sure. But I don't know who or what the CAPS is referring to. I did send a PM to one of the Kindred Spirits, who was very concerned about the negativity this person was generating. I suggested that she flag the post as flags are anonymous in nature, and give the site administrator ( AKA Greta) the opportunity to read what any of us finds offensive, and take decisive action if needed. Being flagged may seem drastic, but there is often no other way to alert Greta...it also doesn't mean that anyone will be automatically banned from the site. What I think is offensive you may not and vice versa! This simply gives Greta a heads up so that she can be made aware of anything potentially disruptive. (I was going to say I didn't know anyone cared if I was wearing a cap while typing~ but I really need a shampoo and didn't have time today yet! To be on the safe side, I got rid of the cap and am moving on and am over having to hide my less than perfect coiffeur!! LOL) The anonymity of the boards sometimes spills over into being almost without boundaries...as mentioned, we are fighting for our lives. Our emotions, including the frustration, fear, and freeness to vent can certainly color our posts now and again. But, by and large, we are indeed Kindred Spirits and hopefully we can separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. Hugs, Chen♥",

We are all too familiar with how it affects those around us; sometimes bringing out the best in people, and sadly, sometimes not.

On the other hand, IF you suspect she is indeed suicidal, that is out of all of our leagues, including yours. Please see to it that she gets in touch with a suicide prevention hotline, or some mental health facility which can help her to navigate these scary waters. Bless you for being the friend you are...and my advice to you is simply to lead with your heart. Tell her you don't know just what to do, or that you too are scared~ be real, cry, hug, laugh...just be honest. Which doesn't mean MORBID!

Today I was able to, so I will let the Kindreds know what's happening with me on my journey. A week ago I started Zometa infusions and Faslodex injections..and of course I had to get all of the listed side-effects! For those of you \"fortunate\" enough to get Neulasta shots, the SE's are similar . :-( The latest and more disturbing is the knee edema~ OMG!!! I literally have not been able to walk for 4 days! Not so much pain, thankfully, but both of my knees look as if I had softballs shoved in them ( lovely visual, isn't it??) and I cannot bend my knees. I hope to live to be at least 90 something, and I mean no disrespect to anyone who is that age, but I am shuffling around as if I have a year to go before I hit 100! I have such a good caregiver in my sweet Reggie~ we have just about exhausted the nation's supply of frozen peas to use as ice packs, not to mention drinking water by the gallon ( which I do anyway)elevating my legs, taking anti-inflammatories and even getting foot massages. Not much has helped, sad to say. I finally put a call into my oncologists office~ the chemo RN ( love, love, love her!!!) called me back almost immediately and said I was doing all of the right things and this side effect would \"eventually\" run its course. That was music to my ears! Lo and behold, I see a smidgen of improvement today...so happy about that! I see as usual I have missed milestones~ hair coloring, birthdays, appointments, travelers, home-comers, joke tellers, bus riders, new ones and those checking in who we haven't seen in a while. I never thought I would be part of that group! So, hello my Kindred Spirits! Know that you are all in my ♥ as I know I am in yours. I have 2 appointments yet this week, so if I am not able to check in, hopefully you will think good thoughts for me just as I do for every one of you. Love you all... Hugs, Chen♥",

So, that one time that there is major traffic on the freeway, somehow it can be my fault . Know what I mean??? It's just an outlet for the Real Issues. Nothing to get our knickers in a twist about. Battles and Wars and all that... For the record, I used to apolgize to my Ex~ and I meant it too.. I would say, \"I'm really sorry about what happened this morning too\"...and the UNSPOKEN part was \"I'm really sorry that you are being such an *$*8$**^~\" and that was the truth!! In your situation, you don't have to have the unspoken 2nd half of the conversation. You can be sorry too~ not for anything you did, but that the day didn't start out right...and isn't that true, too?? You are married to one of the Good Guys! But you knew that already!

And yes, we can cover our missing breasts with clothing, but not having sideburns, and wearing hats or scarves on heads which now seem to be the size of softballs really doesn't fool anyone! LOL Here is something which may help though: When YOU see a woman wearing an obviously chemo-induced bandana as a fashion statement, how do you feel about her? Sickened? Repulsed? Disgusted? Wish she would stay home and hide? I have never met you, but I know you feel no such thing! You probably feel compassion and empathy just knowing she is a Sister in Arms. And you can give each other \"the look\"! a bald or scarved head isn't a sign of weakness, it is a sign of a Kindred Spirit not giving up, but actively engaged in killing the Beast! Just as other women ( and men!) recognize this strength when they see YOU! It is part and parcel of taking charge of your treatment, and knowing that you will go from Bald as a Cueball to Newborn, to Baby Chick, then Chia-pet, then Finger in light-socket, to finally a semblance of what you had pre- cancer!

And I imagine you all think the same way too! But, the only wiggler I will give to the Big C is this: It has made birthdays more palatable! I too will be 60~ as a matter of fact in 20 days! I will also be celebrating big time~and ok! Cancer has made me more aware that days/time are precious, and the alternative to getting old is~ we know what the alternative is!

At that moment there weren't too many responses. In keeping with what my sister calls my \"Switzerland Personality\" I thought of some synomyms, as I never purposely want to casue anyone discomfort. I was going to say \"Champion\" and \"Nemesis\", but by the time I logged back on and saw how others responded, I decided to opt out of the fray. (Truth be told, it was Dawn.Hope and her post which convinced me to leave well enough alone~ we obviously all react differently, both positively and negatively to words) If my words have caused you pain, I am deeply sorry. And to those who relate to and are empowered by them, I am happy about that. The scans...it was a long day, but I reminded myself that I am truly thankful to live in a time where treatment and diagnosis is available, and that I have health insurance. The staff was so attentive and explained every step of the way, even though I had had CT/PET scans before. Being as I have only one \"good arm\" for blood draws and IV's, \"Houston, we have a problem\"..my vein hadn't recovered from the lab work on Wednesday and simply wouldn't cooperate. I couldn't get the saline IV and the radioactive glucose piggybacked in. The nice RN had to use a butterfly and directly inject the radioactive liquid into the side of my tiny wrist. :-( I am nothing if not brave, and though it did hurt, and caused bruising, I was a trooper and didn't cry! I as always, brought a book with me, sat nice and still for an hour, and then had my scans. Also a wonderfully attentive RN at the ready. My sweet Reggie had a delicious hot cuppa coffee waiting for me to stave off my caffeine deprived headache, and then he treated me ( for the 2nd time this week!) to fresh lobster tacos! We went to out favorite little restaurant right on the ocean and breathed in the sea air and ate fresh local lobster. I know the day went as well as it did for myriad reasons: Reggie smudged me with sage smoke before we left; I carried keepsakes from the Kindred Spirits with me, and I know had I had all of the hopes, dreams, prayers and good wishes of all of you with me. Truly, it helped. While in the PET scan chamber, I mentally sang one of the Chumash songs from the group Reggie sings with: it translates to \"Stand Tall\"...it kept me calm and my imagination from getting away from me. So..today and tomorrow I keep busy. I know I am but one person, and lots of us are going through treatment and scares. The good wishes you gave me I know you also sent to the rest of the Kindred Spirits. I love you for that. Thank you! Hugs, Chen♥",

I can still recall your original postings; the fear in your words, and truth be told, the hopelesness. You allowed yourself to be enveloped by those of us who had walked this path a few steps ahead of you, and you became a different woman. Gradually, you allowed yourself to be comforted and educated by The Sisterhood. I remember your query about things spiritual...and how you genuinely appreciated the stories of faith that others shared with you. Look at you now! You are in the forefront of those who educate, comfort and empathize with those now walking behind you!! How many times have you posted a response to someone and have said the exact thing that newly scared Sister needed to hear?? When I see your name as one of the posters, I drop down and read it immediately. I know it will be humorous and insightful, and full of warmth and love. Just as you are. I don't think you were asking the wrong questions at all, by the way. You just didn't know what the answers would be. And now you do! Who knew you would be getting Mardi Gras beads?

The month after I was diagnosed I was able to become a Foster Parent~ no one asked me anything. Of course, it wasn't \"obvious\" yet that I was battling the beast, but honestly, no one asked me my health status, and I didn't offer any info. Another slant on the whole \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\"! I do believe that Sheryl Crowe adopted a son since her diagnoses, and she is also a single parent! If she can do this as a BC survivor,and NOT have a husband/life partner, I dare say you and your husband should be able to do it too! As well all know too well, many of us had babies,toddlers, children with special needs, were divorced, etc etc and then WHAM! We were diagnosed with cancer...our children were not taken away from us, were they???? Let us know what you find out, and Good Luck to you and your husband. Bless your hearts for opening your hearts! (((((hugs))) Chen♥ Adoption and Cancer Can you and should you adopt after a cancer diagnosis? Cancer doesn't stop people from living their lives, and this includes raising a family. Some types of cancer can directly cause infertility, such as testicular, uterine or ovarian cancer. Cancer treatment can also cause temporary or permanent infertility. Even when the cancer doesn't cause infertility, the parents may be concerned about their children inheriting a cancer susceptability gene. For these patients, adoption provides one option for having children. Should you adopt? The moral questions surrounding adoption after cancer are similar to the concerns about having more biological children after a cancer diagnosis. When you adopt or carry a pregnancy to term, you are assuming a responsibility to raise the child to adulthood. A key consideration is whether you (and your spouse) will be alive and physically able to raise the child. Other important questions include: Is the cancer in remission? If so, what is the likelihood of a recurrence? If the five-year survival rate does not exceed 85%, it is clearly irresponsible to take on responsibility for another person. Your oncologist must be willing to write a letter stating that he or she considers you to be cured. Are there other family members who could provide support and take over responsibility for the child if you die? For example, is your spouse healthy? The age of the child also matters. If you are adopting a newborn baby, you should have a life expectancy of at least 20 years, to ensure that your child can graduate college. Do you have a will and does this will provide instructions regarding the placement of your children upon your death? Clearly, even a healthy person could be hit by a truck crossing the street. The ethical issue with adoption after cancer is the extent to which you can predict an unfortunate event. To put it in black and white, what are the odds of your dying before the child reaches adulthood? The following types of cancer have 5-year survival rates of 90% or more: Prostate Cancer Thyroid Cancer Testicular Cancer Skin Cancer (especially Melanoma) Lip Breast Cancer Hodgkin's Lymphoma There are no hard and fast rules, but generally cancer survivors who had other types of cancer should not consider adoption unless there is a clear indication for long-term survival without a recurrence. It is also important to consider the stage of the cancer. A stage 1 survivor is often a better candidate for adoption than a stage 3 or 4 patient since cure rates are higher. In addition, the more time that has passed since the initial therapy without a relapse, the lower the likelihood of a recurrence. Many cancer survivors consider the 5-year-mark as a benchmark for survival. Can you adopt? Each country has its own policies concerning whether cancer survivors can adopt. These policies can change. For example, China previously allowed cancer survivors who had passed the five-year-mark to adopt, but changed the rules in 2007 to not allow cancer survivors to adopt. Even countries that allow cancer survivors to adopt may place a temporary hold on all adoptions as they adopt the Hague Convention or other rules. Most countries require a letter from the prospective adoptive parents' physicians that indicates that they are in general good health. Sometimes these letters are not included in the dossier, but rather are reviewed by the social worker who prepares the home study. (The contents of the doctor's letter will vary from country to country and even adoption agency to adoption agency. It is not uncommon for the letter to indicate that the prospective parent is free of cancer and other diseases and impairments without specifically mentioning a prior history of cancer.) The social worker will sometimes omit any mention of a history of cancer if the country does not specifically ask about cancer. If there is a mention of a history of cancer, the mention should be brief and clearly indicate that the doctor believes the cancer to be cured and that the prospective parents are currently healthy and have a normal life expectancy. Some countries require cancer survivors to have past the five-year mark before they will let them adopt. Others require two or three years. Some adoption agencies impose their own requirements, so it may be worthwhile to shop around for an adoption agency that is more flexible. Countries from which cancer survivors have adopted children include: Colombia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Russia, South Korea (5 years), Ukraine, United States of America and Vietnam. Standards may be more relaxed for cancer survivors who are interested in adopting a special needs or older child. Other Resources The Yahoo Group Adoption After Cancer is a discussion group for cancer survivors who are thinking about adopting.",

      "Content": "Well, a couple of things come to mind here. And the amazing thing is: Pretty much we are ALL in the very same family~ just the names are interchangeable, it seems! I dare say, looking back at the things you were doing before the age of 25, your place as the loving, young, ( scared?) pregnant caregiver to your mother makes you the heart and soul of your family. This \"pecking order\" was established long before you were ever introduced to The Beast called cancer. Of course you have now been through more than you ever expected, physically and emotionally. Which is why you found us, and we bonded with you~ we are Kindred Spirits, speaking the same language and not needing a translator. Even the unspoken words are understood by us. That having been said does not make you immune to frustration, hurt, and even anger. But it is because you are the dynamic, empathetic woman you are which makes you even question the \"how come/why\" of those who are not like you. And, if this clueless attitude of your siblings was happening with co-workers, you would groan and roll your eyes at them and probably let it go! It is FAMILY which affects us the most, and their fellow-feeling and understanding we most desire. So, as a wise person once said to me: Don't worry about the things you cannot change~ but where you personally can do something positive, do it! The rest takes away from our joy of life~ something you have worked to hard to achieve. I am not saying you don't have siblings worth knowing and loving~ but given what I have come to know about you, if I needed loving care, I know who I would call on...and I have an idea you would come running!

You need to treat it with extra TLC~ and this is how I did just that during my radiation therapy. Get yourself the softest natural sponge you can find, and use an unscented body wash; I used, and still use Aveeno , as it is both unscented and made with colloidal oatmeal which is very soothing. NEVER rub your radiated side in the shower!Saturate the natural sponge with plenty of wataer, add the Aveeno and make bubbles~ squeeze it gently over the radiated side, never letting the sponge touch your skin. The softer the sponge the \"squishier\" it will be and more water/Aveeno receptive. Pat yourself dry and then goop on the lotion of choice! Your skin may also get itchy as the rads progress~ if so, ask your Dr for a Prescription for hydrocortisone cream, the OTC varieties are not strong enough to relieve the itch. Hugs, C♥",

      "Content": "Welcome to Hogwarts~ A Primer for the New Ones to our Family So many new ones have joined our family of Kindred Spirits lately~we sigh that you have had to find us, but of course welcome you with open ♥ You may have noticed, or even posted about the fact that many of our friends, family members, co-workers and neighbors just don't \"get it\" and make what seem to be ( and sometimes ARE!) insensitive, rude, and dismissive comments about us and how we look, etc. You don't know me well, but if you hang around the boards long enough,you will notice 2 things about me~I \"steal\" quotes that I like and apply them to our lives regularly, and I also liken our lives to books/movies! Who knew we would be Stars?! :-) And today, we are friends and schoolmates with no less than Harry Potter and Hermione and the entire gang! So~ welcome to CSN, also known as Hogwarts~ the boarding school for witches and wizards! Like you, we were truly surprised when we realized that we would be leaving the lives we had known to enter a place so strange and unknown to us. Upon arriving, we were shocked to see how many witches and wizards already live here~ we thought it would be a tiny place, and that we would be isolated and alone. But No! Freshman, Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors, along with a host of professors surrounded us. Though it was frightening being the new one, we looked to the upperclassmen, those graduating, wondering if we would ever survive the curriculum. Eventually, we settled in, and made good friends with other witches and wizards! Turns out, it's alot like any old school, after all! We know who the smart ones are, the social butterflies, the competitive one, the shy ones, the troubled ones, etc. We come into \"home room\", say hello to everyone, and hang out with our friends! Our aforementioned families/friends/coworkers who don't \"get it\" are, of course, The Muggles. It isn't their fault~they are not part of the Hogwart student body and they really don't know quite how to relate to us. They look at us through different eyes, they are a bit afraid of us, puzzled by changes they see in us, and they want us back the way we were BEFORE we were tapped by the faculty at Hogwarts. Some of our Muggle family members are proud of the achievements we make, and they don't mind meeting our classmates. But some...well, they distance themselves and can't bring themselves to stay connected . It is discouraging... So, take your seat here at Hogwarts! Know that those here with you are very much like you in ways you never imagined. You are indeed different, but that doesn't make you any less valuable. Educate yourself while you are here,and join in with the extra-curricular activities ! We exchange holiday ornaments, we celebrate birthdays, we visit each other, and most of all, we communicate and connect in important, life-long ways. Oh, and feel free to borrow the notes and books you find here~ we are all willing to share what we learned in the previous semesters!! Asking questions and copying is actually encouraged!

I know you know what I mean! It was the scariest, yet most important thing I ever did! I knew that if I didn't go then, I would wake up at 70 and say OMG! I can't go anywhere! And I would have stayed. Resigned and unhappy. For those who stay married or in a relationship \"forever\" and are happy, committed, connected and all of the good things we hope our unions will be~ wonderful! But for others, and I found myself in that category, longevity didn't mean happiness or even contentment, it mean complacency and a giving-up, giving-in to a personal status quo.One I knew was unhealthy for me and my heart. I send you all of the courage and loving support you may need in this journey as well.It is hard, but also a relief on many levels. Not without soul-searching and grieving, but with a light at the end of that journey which is peaceful and yes, opens you to new and other life experiences which I know you will embrace to the fullest. And, for the record~ Holland is still available to you, you know! You and I can go~ Germany, Belgium, and Holland...just like I did in the old days! Hugs, Chen♥",

I had the \"take em all out\" method, and had 3 of 15 positive nodes. On the other hand, I had the surgery BEFORE the TAC chemo cocktail, so the point may be moot. I know this isn't much of a response to yur question, is it??? There are different reasons a physician would recommend one biopsy type over another~the multiple removal method is pretty tried and true. I suggest you have a serious discussion with both of your doctors and make sure everyone is on the same page, as it were. Bottom line is, you want the most agressive treatment plan and full confidence in that plan! We are a growing, and strong family of Survivors~welcome to our ranks! Claudia",

My daughter and I laughed our way thru much of chemo by doing MadLibs! It was distracting, and silly and it reworked my brain to remember exactly what an adverb is! LOL And sometimes I would drift off to sleep, wrapped in my \"blankie\". The room I was in also had a TV, and I could watch an old movie, or the news, or HGTV and cooking shows! The first time was the absolute WORST~ the whole hooking me up to poison, and OMG I really do have cancer, even though I had already had sugery and drains! This was the biggie...Chemotherapy! But, after the first infusion, and knowing I didn't have to go back for another 3 weeks, I settled in and entertained myself. Getting to know the chemo RNs (angels with stethoscopes), feeling welcomed and nurtured at the center all helped. And whearas I am an active person too~ chemo was cumulatively exhausing physically~ I ended up doing less and less each time. I still liked looking up and seeing my 2 favorite people with me, but they could leave to get coffee or make phone calls and I didn't feel abandoned. I would hunker down as much as possible, close my eyes, and know that the poison wasn't killing ME, it was killing the Beast, and giving me a chance to have a long, cancer free life!!

The advice you got about keeping your surroundings disinfected is GREAT; with a depleted white count due to chemo, we are at risk for infection. I do not know what the \"personality\" of your office is, but if you can be honest about needing a helping hand, or whatever it is which can make your treatment easier, by all means, do it! As women, many, if not most of us are Nurturers, and it is hard for us to ask for assistance, and accept help. A BIG word of advice: ACCEPT ANY AND ALL HELP OFFERED TO YOU! Generosity and fellow feeling may be all a person can give you, and believe it or not, you will be happy to receive! On the other side of that coin, there will be a group who may surprise you when they back away from you...just be prepared. It is oftentimes because they feel helpless, afraid, and yes, some think Cancer just may be contagious. No rhyme or reason for how people are going to react to us!

I use an old, old printer, sans scanner that is in the spare bedroom to print out plane tickets and the like! And it isn't so much that my Reggie is technologically challenged~ it's just that we live less than 1/8 of a mile from the Tribal Hall and all of it's offices, so he makes a call, or we pop over and have our friends on staff print/scan for us! Our pix from Cabo San Lucas taken last October haven't made it from the camera to the computer yet...sheesh we are awful, aren't we??

Thus, I have lovely shots of where we were, but no people in them! He always said it wasn't necessary to have us in them~ we knew we were at whatever location, and didn't need to \"prove\" it to anyone else.

I hate to admit this, but I have had no pix taken of me since my diagnosis, either. I side step every camera I see...there was an opening of the new resort/casino, with commerative photos.

      "Content": "It is of course sooo subjective,isn't? I have never stopped coming to CSN since I joined in 2003, and for myriad reasons. I know what my personality type is, and as prolific as I know I seem, and as much as I like to write, and hopefully show myself as empathetic, in truth I am quite shy in person. I have a small circle of friends, and have had them since Jr High School.(I am now 60) I am acquainted with lots of people, but I don't really hang out with a group. I feel comfotable here online with this cyber-family! I don't work outside the home, so I can spend as much time as I want in here...or not! Another thing I know about me is that I love to \"Pay It Forward\"...I was at such a horrible place in my personal life when I was diagnosed. CSN was literally a life-line for me. I honestly don't know how I would have come through all of this without CSN. Everytime I want to leave, or perhaps ignore a newbie, I think, \"that was me\" and then I can't bring myself to leave. So, not working outside of them home, not having children, and living with a man who is not only loving but generous, gives me time ( and the ongoing desire) to be here. Being honest, if my personality were more outgoing, and if I had perhaps grown up here in this small town rather than coming here after a divorce, and especially if I had to go to a job here, no doubt I would have been here less! So, obviously, there is no right and wrong! The Life Afer Cancer we all desire takes different forms.I have friends who got out of treatment and never looked back. Cancer was THEN, and it has nothing to do with them now. They do not ever wear pink ribbons, they have never joined CSN, they don't do the Relay For Life, none of their lives seem connected to anything having to do with cancer. Does this make them less thankful or empathetic than I am? Of Course Not! I know this is probably of no help to you~ each of us has to decide for ourselves when ( or if) we leave! But you knew that already, didn't you???? Hugs, Chen♥",

The cancer center I went to was all private rooms, and I understand some of the warriors here are in a room full of people. My experience was, I got settled in, had the port accessed with the drugs, I turned on the TV and either watched something which made me so bored I fell asleep, or my niece and I spent the time doing Mad-Libs, which we adored!

      "Content": "Hmmmm~ I must say I don't see myself in most of these traits. It somehow doesn't make sense to me. I DO fit the caring, happy-making personality. But I thought that came from having such a Great Relationship with both of my parents, and emulating their hardworking, generous, caring spirits. My dad, for example, would invite strangers in to dinner! When college kids worked door-to door selling books, magazines, etc, my dad would holler at my mom to cook more pasta or whatever, as we were having company! If he would see a young couple with a baby waiting at a bus stop in the rain, he would give them a lift to wherever they were going. Sometimes he would drive an hour out of his way! And guess what? He died of cancer! His love for me was so unconditional, that when he was dx, (I had moved 3000 miles away) he swore the rest of the family to secrecy. He did NOT want me to change my life's plans and he wanted me to have healthy rememberances of him, and not see him ill. The last time we spoke was on my wedding day, when he called to tell me he loved me. My sister calls me \"Switzerland\"...and is quick to say it is not because I am neutral, but because I am the peace-maker, and the family member who arranges all of the feel-good get togethers. If this has caused my cancer, so be it! I wonder what personality does NOT cause cancer! Interesting..... hugs, Claudia",

The list is sooooo endless! I have decided to Live My Life~ for however long it lasts! I am not reckless; I eat well and exercise, and LOVE my fruits and veggies. But I also love a glass ( or 2) of wine and OMG the occasional martini with olives!!!! I wondered if living life in an austere fashion would give me length, but not quality and little laughter. I did think about it...and then I remembered two good CSN friends. One was a vegan, non smoker, runner, who died of Lung Cancer (!!) the other a man who survived Viet NAm, and cancer and then died on his way to give his granddaughter away at her wedding~ his wife fell asleep at the wheel on their way to the ceremony. That's my take, anyway! Love you! Chen♥",

I became a member of this family in April 2003, and was exclusively found in the chatroom. In 2006, or maybe early 2007 I was asked to be part of a focus group to help encourage women to actually come to the BC discussion boards and post! Would you believe that there used to be just a few women who came in here and more often than not there were only 3, 4 or 5 responses to any given topic???? I, and about 6 others started posting in here regularly~ there is another one of that focus group who still comes in and is a regular, encouraging, wonderful part of the BC family...can you guess who she is??? The others have since moved on to other pursuits and don't post here any longer. But they were instrumental in making the boards what they are today! But, now that I let you in on that little secret ( and don't tell anyone, ok??? LOL) do you think that the group of 8 sisters was successful in jump-starting these discussion boards????

Newboobs, who remembered that I used to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses said, \"Wow Chen, you have this down! I guess you never forget how to hand out literature while trying to get people to join something!\" LOL LOL I laughed soooo hard! The morning Newboobs and her husband were checking out of the hotel, Reggie called their room, disguised his voice as some \"foreigner\" and was seemingly frustrated asking Ken if he wanted the room service delivered to his room or packed to go!!!

One says: \"My husband bought me a 3 carat diamond ring for my birthday\"...To which the woman next to her replied \"Isn't that nice\"? Woman 2 declared that her husband bought her a week at a health spa. To which the woman again replied, \"Isn't that nice\"? When asked what her husband had done for her recently, she said her husband had sent her to charm school. \"Charm School??? Whatever for\"? asked one of the shocked women. To which she sweetly replied...\"Well, I used to say, I don't give a @#*%$#@%....and now I just say \"Isn't that nice\"???? I offer a big \"Isn't That Nice\" to the entire group of women who were featured in the magazine, and how they chose ( HA!) to beat cancer! Some of it no doubt is in the editing of the articles, and perhaps the women were even encouraged to use specific words to describe their journey. What all of us here know: This is the room and the venue to experience the REAL DEAL as far as fighting, winning, and sometimes, sadly, NOT winning this battle. We are the most insightful, inspiring, complex, honest group of women I have ever had the honor to know.

I lived close to the radiation center, and scheduled mine for the earliest appointment of the day, so the rest of the day was still wide open to me. Side effects...fatigue can be one, though not all experience it. The burn is generally cumulative, you might not notice anything is happening to your skin, but it is! Treat your skin with the utmost gentleness and tender care. NO rubbing or irritating the radiated area in the shower! Get yourself a water-loving natural sponge, and some Aveeno body wash. Make sure you do not use anything with dyes or perfume, for that reason Aveeno is really a good choice. Saturate the sponge with water, add Avenno to make lather, and squeeze the sponge over your radiated site. NO need to have the sponge even touch your skin! The radiation center I went to gave out tubes of Aquaphor ointment to help keep the ever-drying skin moisturized. As much as you can, go bra-less and wear big old T-shirts and goop yourself with ointment. If your skin gets itchy, be sure and tell your DR...he will prescribe Cortisone cream....the OTC brands won't do the trick. Listen to your body~ it will tell you when it wants to rest. Oh yeah~ drink plenty of water!!! You need to keep yourself hydrated. The good news: Radiation is lightning fast, it kills rogue cancer cells, it is usually completed in a months time, and for some unknown reason...cancer doesn't seem to be active on weekends and/or holidays! Thus~ radiation is only scheduled Monday thru Friday! :-) Hey, sisters, can you think of anything I have left out???? Hugs, Claudia",

Diagnoses, treatment options, staging, etc etc weigh heavily on all of our minds. Fortunately, what things didn't perhaps \"look good\", as you say, only a few years ago, look MUCH better now! My oncologist told me that, although the numbers of those being diagnosed have not lowered significantly, the SURVIVAL RATES with the aggressive treatment options available to us have sky-rocketed! Breast Ca is almost ( I say tongue in cheek) a \"run of the mill\" cancer which, it seems, every woman will get and get over. I am not at all being condescending or taking this lightly~ ALL of us in here are dealing with killing the Beast. Some are out of treatment, some are caregivers, some in the midest of treatment, and others, such as yourself are in a big decision making stage. We are united in bonds of understanding and compassion the likes of which you will be hard pressed to find anywhere. One thing is certain; you are now part of this strong Family, and our ears and hearts are will you every step of your journey. Hugs, Claudia",

When asked what the problem was, Eileen went into a passionate, painful tirade listing every problem they had ever had in the 25 years they had been married. She went on and on and on: neglect, lack of intimacy, emptiness, loneliness, feeling unloved and unlovable, an entire laundry list of unmet needs she had endured over the course of their marriage. Finally, after allowing this to go on for a sufficient length of time, the therapist got up, walked around the desk and after asking Eileen to stand, embraced her and began kissing her passionately,while sensuously rubbing her back as her husband Bob watched with a raised eyebrow and his eyes staring at them in shock! Eileen shut up, tucked in her blouse, and quietly sat down while basking in the glow of being obviously appreciated. The therapist turned to Bob and said, 'This is what your wife needs at least three times a week. Can you do this?' Bob thought for a moment and replied, 'Well, I can drop her off here on Mondays and Wednesdays, but on Fridays, I play golf. Happy Memorial Day! Hugs, Chen♥",

He knew he didn't have much time, so he planned his service, and the music. Being a newspaperman, his service was a big party at the Press Club, with friends, family, toasts and jazz. He died in Europe, I was a newlywed living in California, so the family had the ashes sent to me where I tearfully scattered them in a National Forest. This passing was hard on us , but he was not left to waste and linger. He died with his family and his dignity in tact. My mom died of kidney disease...she had been ill about a year. When she went to the hospital not feeling well, she said that if she had known she was going to have to spend the night there, she would have brought her lipstick. She didn't wake up the next morning.... Again, good for her, hard on us. But I have often said I hope I too go out as vain and peacefully as my mother did! I took a 3rd of her ashes and scattered them in the same forest near to my dad. As for me? Some days I think I would fight like a mother tiger, and other days, I think I might just let go. I suppose it depends on what the dx would be. And its prognosis. What I hopefully learned from my parents passing ( and my own battle) is this: Mend fences, Make love, Speak love, Laugh, Think, Reflect, and give those you leave behind the knowledge that you were someone special in their lives!!! And Coug, you already ARE the diamond in Dusty and Mac's lives... Hugs, Claudia",

I still have amazing and heartfelt support from so many family and friends~it makes this long journey truly easier. I touted CSN at the Relay, and of course  as I did what laps I could, I chanted \"CSN, CSN\"  My sister and I made 27 Luminarias, including one dedicated to my Kindred Spirits and CSN....you are always with me!!! You have made me smile today, Pat~ thank you again for thinking of me.

I came across a site of PAGES of wise sayings by Gandhi~ and I can only imagine the peace and tranquility emanating from him.

I am so glad you had this opportunity! ( You will notice quite a different energy and mood on Saturday at USC!!!)

We are generally prescribed either Tamoxifen or Arimidex ( I take Arimidex) for 5 years post treatment depending on the type of cancer we had.

It is generally for Post-Menopausal women~ which I am. Tamoxifen does the same thing for different reasons~ hey Tamox users~ help our sister out here! :-) I am just finishing up 5 years of Arimidex, and so far NO recurrence! Hugs, Claudia",

My sister in law, who was a long time chemo RN was correct when she told me that the way I reacted to my first chemo would by and large set the tone for subsequent infusions of the Beast killing poison! I was queasy, but never threw up...not the first time, nor the rest of the times. This is not to say it was a walk in the park! For me, a few things made it \"worse\". The fatigue was cumulative; I eventually entered a Twilight Zone of exhaustion which I didn't know existed. That exhaustion made me \"cranky\", and weepy. Rather like a 2 year old at the supermarket who is a few hours past naptime! We are also known to get a REAL condition called \"chemo-brain\". Cognitive function suffers, we feel as if early Alzheimers is setting in, and it is scary to think that that this may be who we will always be! Thankfully,it does reverse itself! And on those days WAY past treatment, you can still use it as an \"excuse\"if you ever feel addle-brained! If your white count drops, and your DR says you need a shot of a white-boosting drug called Neulasta, it can be painful. It does a great job of creating white cells, and does so by speeding up its production in the bone marrow. Being as we have 206 bones, and they are now all working overtime, 48 hrs after the injection our bones can ache for 3 days or so. You can take Tylenol to help with that. I know the Kindred Spirits in here will weigh in and help you make your way to Life After Cancer! Hugs, Claudia",

He kept me grounded, I kept him amused! It was interesting that you mention being angry. Of course I am ALWAYS \"\"stronger than and not angry at!\" ( you believe that, right??I wish, I wish, I wish) What tended to make me angry was the complaints of those untouched by cancer. I was angry that they hated their haircuts, or that they whined about the most trivial things. It didn't take too long for me to realize that I wasn't really angry...I was JEALOUS. I wanted smudged nail polish to equal the worst day ever. Or the cable going out, or losing my car in the mall parking lot. The things that \"those people\" were b.itching about.
