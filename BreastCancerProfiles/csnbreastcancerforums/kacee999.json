      "Content": "When one door closes...another opens. Don't look at this as horrible...I found that when I went out in public wearing my scarves (and believe me there are wonderful beautiful scarves out there on line! Don't just settle for a bandana!) I had people coming up to me...fellow cancer patients giving me a high five, one woman in a restaurant who was wearing a hat that said Cancer Sucks, and obviously was going through it too, came and gave me a hug out of nowhere, people stopping me and saying they loved my scarves and they needed to get some for their sister, mother, daughter, friend who hadn't thought of those or seen any to purchase. I carried the websites around for all the places I bought my scarves. When I was done, I donated my scarves to a lady at work who was just diagnosed, and she has been thrilled. Experiment with your jewelry, dangley earrings looks GREAT! Put on more eye makeup! (www.headcovers.com; www.tlcdirect.org; www.4women.com; www.scarvesforcancerpatients.com)",

      "Content": "I had HORRIFIC dreams while I was on the steroids. I dreaded going to bed at night. They weren't nightmares per se, just dark greasy black machine-like filthy uncomfortable dreams with bad smells and bad sounds. Don't know how else to express them. The dreams stopped several days after the steroids were done, but I'd knew they'd be back with the next round of steroiods during my next chemo session. Brrrrrrrrrrr.",
