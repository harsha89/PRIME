      "Content": "Hi and welcome. I am 58 yrs old. I was first dx in 2001 with calcifications, stage 0 DCIS, had lumpectomy and 37 rads. I am also in that small percentage that was chosen to have been with bc again in 2009. They called it a new primary. It was also calcifications in the same breast very near original site. I had bilateral mastectomy with Latissimus flap reconstruction in Sept 09. I am still dealing with \"filling\" the expanders and hope to have the exchange surgery soon. You are so right in that the 2nd cancer is different ballgame. I know a positive mind is important in my recovery but sometimes difficult. I have to believe I was also chosen to be a survivor. I was born and raised in mid ILL but have called Mich home for the past 40 yrs. I have family in Ill and have the need to go \"home\" and see the cornfields occassionally. I hope you are able to find the support you need. We are all on this journey together and are stronger than we think. Take care. Marilyn",

It can seem like such a long journey but we are stronger than we think. If your weather is anything like mine, it may be nice and warm when you get out. We had heavy frost just days ago today supposed to be in the 70's. Now we just have to keep from getting sick from the change of weather. Take good care of yourself. Marilyn",

I believe I have also been chosen to be a survivor. God has a good plan for our lives and we are stronger than we think. This board has been such an inspiration and source of info for me. Thank all you pink sisters. Marilyn",

      "Content": "Hi Dot. Sorry you have to go thru more surgery. I had bilateral mastectomy with Latissimus flap reconstruction on 9-3-09. The plastic surgeon did discuss the possibility of having problems with it before surgery as my left breast was damaged from previous radiation. On my follow up visit to breast surgeon 1 wk postop, she expressed concern about it. 3 days later I had follow up appt with plastic surgeon and he told me I had to have further surgery to remove dead tissue. Very disappointing. It was scary to see breast turn black. I felt like I had done something wrong and was a failure. I did have the surgery 3 days later and he successfully removed tissue, but he said the blood supply and muscle seemed to be doing ok. It set my physical recovery back a bit and my emotional recovery suffered. I have had 6 fillings--50cc's at a time. I am talking to my \"girls\" thanking them for 57 yrs and telling them we will get thru this and it will be ok no matter what. I hope to have the exchange before spring. Hang in there and take care of yourself. Marilyn",

      "Content": "Hi linpsu and welcome. I am still shocked that I was dx with recurrance about 8 mos ago. In 2001, I had lumpectomy, rad treatments, took Tamox for 4-1/2 yrs and thought I was doing whatever necessary for good health--other than stress from bad marriage. In 2001 I was told I had 95% chance of not having cancer return. I lost on those odds and had bilatral mastectomy with Latissimus flap recon with expanders in Sept. Last week I had the exchange surgery and am now working on getting used to my new normal self. Cancer takes a toll on our minds and our bodies. My emotions are all over the place--one day (sometimes one minute)may be bad and the next I know I am going to be ok no matter what. I have faith that God has a good plan for our lives. Take good care of yourself and just know positive thoughts and prayers are coming your way. Marilyn",
