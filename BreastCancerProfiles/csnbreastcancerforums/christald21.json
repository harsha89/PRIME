      "Content": "HI,    I  will try and make this as short as possible.  I am set to have my surgery on the 25th.  First it will be 8 weeks since my last chemo.  So i am worried that it is so long since my last chemo that some of cancer might of come back.  Although the doctors don't seem concerned.  I did have IDC with her2 so i am still doing Herceptin every 21 days.  with my surgery i will be having double masectomy with also lympnodes removed, and then reconstruction with expanders put in with drains.  From my understanding this surgery will be the most intense out of all the other ones that will follow. My questions to all of you that have had to go through this.  Just how long does all this take, for recovery?  How much pain is involved, and any good advice while i am healing from the first surgery?   My reconstruction surgeon says it will be roughly 6 months before i can get the implants put in, as long as no complications.  I am  nervous as hell.  And i want to go  back to work too soon.  I am a casino dealer here in Las Vegas, and a partime fitness instructor too.  Which i have had to put it all on hold during my chemo. I am hoping i can go back and do all of this while the expanders are in, but might have to modify a few things. ",

      "Content": "I have scleroderma,,,   and breast  cancer.  I will not be doing my 2nd chemo treatment tomorrow because i need more lab work done to take to my rheumotologist on Tuesday.   I guess i keep coming up with high liver enzymes.  Even though i survived the first round of chemo three weeks ago.  I just don't know what to think, or do here.  I am hoping i can continue with treatments.. Onconologist said that the chemo can even help with my scleroderma..  but i guess it didn't do it...  I was just wondering if anyone else has gone through the same thing?",

      "Content": "HI,     I hope someone can help.. It has been an emotional rollercoaster for me!!!!   i just had double masectomy with lymphnode taken out.. My original diagnoses was  IDC with Her2 stage 3A..  I had 6 rounds of chemo,, DONE!  Then surgery.  When i came out of surgery the surgeon told my boyfriend, and have on paper that all of it came out clear \" no cancer\"  I go into the surgeon today 8 days after surgery, and she tells me that i have still the one lymphnode with cancer!  WHAT?!!!  I am devastated!   I read the report, it says that the one lymphnode they took out  was no tumor, except , i guess when they sliced it?  They found .5 cm.   also the tumor they took  (out of tissue duct)out had 1.9 cm tumor.  It was originally 2.5, i guess after chemo it shrunk.   I am so confused,  now she says i have to have 6 rounds of radiation.  She told me that if we did complete masectomies that i wouldn't need radiation, because they will take out all the tissue. Please, can someone explain to, I have expanders in also, she said i look good and healing very good.  But then she threw in that i still have to have radiation, and that now i am stage 2A,,, Just on my right side, one lympnode, but they took that one out.  So why would i have to have radiation,   and can someone tell me if its as bad as Chemo.   What are the side effects?  She was so quick with me,, like it was nothing,, then after all the bad news, she says \"have a nice holiday\"   So Cold!!!",

I have  had 6 rounds of chemo,, now i will be having only Herceptin every 21 days, i think for 6 more rounds, to complete the year...  But my main concern is just what are, if any, side effects for just the Herceptin....  please tell me my tastebuds and mouth will not be affected and no nausea.  My doctor said this will be like a vacation as compared the very intense 6 rounds i just did for last 18 weeks",
