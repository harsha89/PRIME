      "Content": "There are also other risks to consider besides general anesthesia. I had a horrible staph infection after my surgery which was pretty serious for me at 45 - can't imagine it at 93. What does your mother want? Does she want to be aggressive? Get some honest answers for her from her doctors. What happens if she doesn't do anything? Radiation is a breeze for some, but it can be VERY uncomfortable and I would think her skin is more fragile. How much difference would the rads make? You've got a tough role to help your mom make this decision. Make sure that everyone is considering quality of life for her. Take care and good luck! Diane",

My mom was on tamoxifen for 5 years post-menopause and didn't notice any side effects. You could always try it, and if you find yourself miserable, you can stop taking it. You might be pleasantly surprised. Diane",

I was 45 and pre-menopausal when I was diagnosed - chemo put me into menopause. I've taken Tamoxifen since Sept. and I take Celexa to help cope and vitamin E to help with hot flashes. You don't need to feel sad and depressed - you've been through enough already. That's the way I see it anyway - Diane",

Also, we took a day off for routine maintenance on the machines, and also they let us choose whether or not we wanted to come on the fourth of July. My take is that it happens once in awhile and a day here or there is not big deal. I also got too burned and had to switch to the boost for a few days to let it heal, and then finish up with the regular rads. Hope that helps - Diane",
