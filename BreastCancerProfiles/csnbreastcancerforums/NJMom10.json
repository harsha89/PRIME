      "Content": "Double Whammy. Definitely check out the AMC. At the Look Good Feel Better event I went to, the leaders were passing out wigs for everyone to try on and several women went home with them that night. I thought one woman actually looked better in the wig than in her own hair. (I didn't tell her that of course!!) And I get you too. It is annoying. As we continue to feel better and start to feel like maybe this disease is licked, there is that \"GI Jane\" head staring back at us in the mirror reminding us of the journey we've been on rather than the bright hopeful road ahead! You've got my sympathy. It's a gift to be alive, but it would still be nice to be alive with HAIR!",

      "Content": "I just finished 4 rounds of AC and I'm starting 4 rounds of Taxol. I've heard from most that the Taxol rounds are 'easier'. But I'm worried about the megadoses of Decadron I have to take to counteract any allergic reactions to the Taxol. I was taking 1 Decadron per day during the AC and experienced nervousness and insomnia from that. Now I'm taking 5 pills the night before and 5 the morning off the chemo! I brought this up to my onc and he just said, \"well you probably won't sleep much the night before and the night of the chemo.\" Anyone have any experience with this.",

Venting here is a great resource, but consider, if you haven't already some local American Cancer Society support groups. They may have help available like babysitting and counseling for your little girl. You will get through it. Prayers, Barbara",

      "Content": "Other than the obvious, that surgery takes time and expense, I'm wondering why you opt for no surgery to remove the fibroid. I've had fibroids for several years now and my gyno and I have been watching them to see if they will get bigger or shrink. Since I was so close to menopause, and now probably in it due to the final push of chemo, we decided to wait on surgery. He said the fibroids would shrink when I hit menopause. I had an ultrasound last month and his predictions were correct, the fibroids and my uterine lining have both gotten smaller. Great news as I am on Tamoxifen now and that drug can cause the opposite effect. But, if I didn't receive this news, I was prepared to have them removed. Why? Because the pain, swelling and discomfort from them these past few years has just been a royal nuisance! Of course, you have to make your own decision, but I think if it was me, I would just have the damn thing taken out! Just my opinion. Best wishes for a great outcome whatever you decide to do! Oh and on the daughter front...I have found my journey with my daughter to be such a roller coaster. For months she will be fine and then wham, she's tortured and a mess! The best thing to do is monitor her activity in every way you can. Although I've heard people say not to be invasive into their privacy, I don't listen to that. I have read her diaries to check on her activities. And although I've read some pretty scary stuff in there, I usually don't confront her directly. Instead, I talk about the things she's doing in a 3rd party type of way, like describing the terrible side effects of smoking or drugs or talking about someone else's struggle with weight and how they dealt with it. So far, I find this works for us. She is 20 now and her moody, messed up times seem to be getting less and less. Good luck with it all and keep us posted. I'm curious to hear how the acupuncture works out. I'm thinking of trying Reiki therapy. Anything to ease the pain of the last 9 months of treatments! Hugs, Barb",
