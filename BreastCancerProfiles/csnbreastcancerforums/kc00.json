    "Content": "Hello lovely pple, This site as being of great information to me about cancer. Its started in November,09 when my girlfriend age 25 started coughing blood then came lump(not sure if its the right word or spelling)on her breast.She decided to see a doc. did some scan all negative and the doc suggest to wait until Jan,2010 to see if the lump grows further.Cutting the story short,she did surgrey on both breast taking out the lump detected from the mammogramm and utralsound scan.Then came the histology report its cancer but the doc.couldnt say what stage cause she couldnt perform more scan.We talking about africa,Nigeria to be precise. Now she started 3 weeks chemo.So many pain for her and am helpless in-fact l hate myself that l do not know what to do or how to help her. I reside in Germany and was thinking of bringing her here for treatment but the doc.suggested US or UK cos they are more advance in treatment unlike Germany. The issue of financing the treatment is als high since she is not insured in those countries. Am confused,am broken and helpless knowing my fiancee is going through such pain.Any advice for me please on what to do ? Thanks at all",
