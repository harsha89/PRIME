    "Content": "Hi! I came here because I am worried about my friend. She survived brest cancer 4 years ago but has recently been rediagonised with terminal cancer. Her husband is angry and not very supportive, I imagine it is just as hard on him. She has been going to chemo but it has been making her so sick and she just found out her levels incresed with the chemo so it may not even be working. I just hung up the phone with her and I do not know how to support her. I think she may be suicidal and I can't even imagine what she is going thru. I came here to check it out to see if this would be an appropiate place for her, maybe I could get her here?",
