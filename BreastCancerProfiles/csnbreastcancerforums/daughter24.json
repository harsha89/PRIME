      "Content": "We went to my mom's doctor's appointment yesterday to get the reports and pathology from the surgeon. So far the results look good but an oncologist has yet to look them over and give his/her opinion, tell us what stage she is in, and what treatments she will be receiving. All of the spaces for prognosis throughout all of the reports, say favorable. The frozen section is negative for metastic tumor. The margins are clear. No residual infiltrating ductal carcinoma. It is 85% estrogren receptive with favorable prognosis. It is 30% progesterone receptive with a favorable prognosis. The Ki-67 proliferation Marker shows the percentage of cells showing nuclear staining. Under 10% is favorable. She is 11% so it's borderline. Did anyone have similar results and if so what kind of treatment was necessary? We are in NJ so we are trying to find the best doctors and treatment facilities. We know she can't start treatments until her surgical areas have healed but once they are healed we want to start treatments immediately. Again, thank you all for responding to my messages and for all of your prayers. I keep you all in my thoughts and prayers daily.",
