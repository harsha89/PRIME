    "Content": "My wife (age 49) was just diagnosed with TNBC with no lymphnode involvement. Her tumor showed signs of both IDC and DCIS. She had a full lateral mastectomy 3 weeks ago and has expanders in place in preparation for implants. Her oncologist says she does NOT need any further treatment i.e., no chemo, because the size of the IDC was only 1.5 mm. The DCIS was 6mm. As you can imagine she feels fortunate to have caught it early, yet very scared, since TNBS is agressive and it appears that the chance of reoccurance is high. She is inclined to do chemo despite her doctor's recommendation, as she doesn't want to leave anything to chance. However, she's afraid to do chemo, due to the damage it can do to her system. The purpose of my post is to hear from others that have a similar diagnosis and hear your thoughts on whether to do Chemo vs. not. Thank you in advance for particpating in my post. HackTown",
