      "Content": "I have an implant after reconstruction and I was having some tightness. It turns out that the original implant had become surrounded with scar tissue and was too small in the first place. They removed it, replaced it with a larger one and released the scar tissue. Everything is going along fine, now and it looks a lot better. Go to your plastic surgeon and complain. If he/she blows you off, find another one.",
