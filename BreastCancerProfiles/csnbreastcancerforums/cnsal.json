    "Content": "Thanks to everyone who replies to my message about reconstruction. i had the mastectomy done last Monday, and had the drains removed yesterday. I went with my original decision, and didn't do any reconstruction. I told the surgeon that i didn't want any reconstruction at all. I am very happy with my decision. I have no problem facing my new body. I have another question and will ask in the next message. thanks. Take care everyone. Ann.",
