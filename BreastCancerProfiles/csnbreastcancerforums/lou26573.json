    "Content": "Hi Minka, I was in your shoes 12 months ago, there is a lot of help from this site, so hang in there with us, ok? I had a bi-lateral masectomy instead of a lumpnectomy. You will stay one or two nights in the hospital, the night nurses are very attentive. If you do not have someone to stay with you, you will be ok. You will need a ride home as you will be very weak. The pillow over your chest is needed between the seat belt. I could not use pump soap or lotion the first few days because I couldn't push them down. Be sure and have some milk, water, or other liquid in small containers you can lift. You may need a friend or a home nurse to help you with your drains the first few days. I had to go back to my plastic surgeon about 4 days after surgery so you may need someone to drive you. I had small pillows shaped like hearts that helped under my arms. I didn't need very many pain pills, but even a few may make you very constipated so be sure and have a laxative on hand. Have food cooked and in small light weight containers that you can place in the microwave. It is so normal not to want to do this alone, if your family can't make it, please tell a few friends, you will be amazed at how people want to help you. Sure hope this helps you a little. By the way, reconstruction was started on me at the time of the masectomy, it saved another hospital visit. God bless you,",
