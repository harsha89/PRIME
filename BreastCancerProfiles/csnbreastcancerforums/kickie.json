      "Content": "She woke up in the morning look in mirror saw 3 hairs on her head, \"Well\", she said, i think i'll braid my hair today, so she did & had a wonderful day. Next day looked in mirror, saw 2 hairs on her head. \"H-M-M' she said, i think I'll part my hair today down the middle today\" So she did & had a wonderful day. Next day she woke up& saw 1 hair on her head, \"Well\", she said i will wear hair in ponytail. So she did & had a wonderful day. The next day she woke up, looked in mirror, noticed there wasn't a single hair on her head. 'YAY'! she exclaimed, I don't have to fix my hair today!!! Attitude is everything! Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of batttle. Live simply, Love generously, Care deeply, Speak kindly, Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass: It's about learning to dance in the Rain.",
