      "Content": "I had my last chemo on Apr 29/04 and wore my wig until late Sept. I was fortunate enough to find a wig that matched my normal color and style so closely that all through treatment people at work and in church kept asking me when I was going to lose my hair! My daughter's wedding was in Sept and I decided I wanted to look like my usual self in the pictures instead of the very short curly (my normal hair is poker straight!) post chemo hair, so I kept the wig for the wedding and took it off for good the following Mon! People then said they liked my haircut and perm--most expensive perm in the world!! Good luck and God bless, Di",

      "Content": "I'm on Arimidex, not Femara, but since some of the effects are the same I'll put in my 2 cents! I've been taking the Arimidex since July '04, so just over a year. I had hand and finger joint pain along with some trigger finger from the start of the drug, which got slowly worse with time--not horrible, just nagging. I work in clothing retail and it got very difficult to pinch the hanger when hanging up the clothes. Just when I was beginning to think I'd have to switch to a different dept at work, the pain started getting less. Over about six weeks, beginning around May, it decreased to the point I now have some stiffness and occasional triggering, but very little pain, and the hangers don't bother me at all. I have no idea why as I haven't done or taken anything different. Just remember everyone reacts differently to these drugs, and apparently our bodies sometimes adapt over time. Good luck, and God bless, Di",
