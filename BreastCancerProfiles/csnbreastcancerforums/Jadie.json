I have a lot of scar tissue and some calcifications. They have watched it closely to be sure that it is shrinking. (which it has) I still go every 6 mo for mamo. My surgeon said that scar tissue from a lumpectomy looked a lot like cancer on a mamo. I'm sure that they are just being cautious.Sounds like they are staying on top of things. Of course you are scared. Thats normal. I still get scared. Waiting is the worst part. Don't be afraid to ask your dr for xanax if you feel you need it. It sure helps with the anxiety. Hugs Jadie",

She (the radiologist) schedules her yearly mamograms also. First she had mamograms every 3 months narrowing down to every 6 months now yearly. Decisions for your treatment will be entirely up to you and I am sure that you will make the right decisions for yourself. Maby you should do research to help you understand your options. One thing you might want to research is the long term side effects of chemo and rads. My mother was 77 when she had treatment and she did great. A little worn out by the end but none the less she handled it great. I had bc at 49 and did chemo and rads. Rads was a breeze compared to chemo. That was almost 5 yrs ago. I wish you the best with your treatments. Keep us posted as to how you are doing.",
