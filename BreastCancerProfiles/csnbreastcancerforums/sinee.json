      "Content": "Hi there Dawne, I started Rads only 3 days ago...had a good cry after day one. Not sure where all the emotional upheaval came from, but didn't question it, just let it rip. There is a group on here called the Radiation Room. It is very helpful, and everyone is going through it to some degree. join us when you can. I also have 30 rads. Breast cancer and lymph nodes so doing double duty with breast, armpit, shoulder area, and sternum. I to am blonde hair and fair skin, and was just told by the nurse about the aquaphor today, so I have already had 3 treatments b4 I heard about it. Glad I did hear today. All will be well, we will get through this too. I also find the chat room helpful, so many wonderful people on there too. And if you can't sleep, someone is always on. Talk to you again Texas. Cindy",

      "Content": "Hi all, I haven't written in a while, but want to say a big thank you for always being here. When I needed you most, you eased my fears and shared my worries. I am well on the mend and am grateful for it, back to work 20 hours a week and loving the after school program, even graduated to my own room of 2nd and 3rd graders this year. Progress on the room was slow, and some of the little ones didn't think it would ever get finished, but alas it has. We are hosting the Holoween party in our room so after homework they are all busy with making decorations. I work with wonderful people and I still \"hit the wall\" between the morning program and the afternoon program 2 days a week, and so I go into another room and lay down for about 20 minutes to revive. Then I am up and running again. Just had my first Photo show, this month and it was a wonderful success. So even that work has improved. Took on a bit to much all at once so I had to slow it down. But little by little, parts of my life are coming back into focus. My daughter and husband of 1 year, have purchased there home and are anxious to be in before the Holidays. I promised myself worry free Holidays this year, and I intend to keep that promise. My granddaughter turned 2 in September and is a great joy in my life. I am still achy, swollen, and often over tired, but all in all, I am doing great. I am looking forward to my daughter and her new husband to begin there family soon. But I have been very good, and haven't said anything, well not much, hahaha. Appreciating every sunrise, every sunset, all the colors of fall, I even felt good when we closed the pool this year. Unlike last year when I didn't think I would see it re opened. Terror. Fun stuff. Well I am here, still above ground, and plan on being here for some time to come. Today was a good day, and if they keep adding up, it will continue to be a beautiful joy filled life, one simple day at a time. Lots of love to all of you. I Breath, and I enjoy the simplest parts of my days like never before, no one is promised tomorrow~that I already thought I knew and understood, yet I never lived it~today was joys, and pains, and thrills, and spills~and I was in it~Best to you all, today.

      "Content": "I don't know if I can add anthing to the wonderful comments that are here already, except that I don't blame God for cancer. It is just a fact of life these days. We haven't been good stewards of the earth and this is the result. Enough about that or I won't shut up. lol. Each day I wake up I try and stay in bed for an extra second just to be sure that I am starting my day with a smile. Seems silly but it is somedays, the only smile I can manage all day. Other days I am busy and full of life. So each day presents it's own ups and downs. Same as before. Your journey is just begining and I wish for you an easy one. Do ask for help, with everything that you need. It is YOUR time to heal, get better, rest, stay away from germs and any one that is sick...protect yourself...right now, for the first time in your life, YOU are the most important person in your circle of friends and family. Take care of you. The rest of life will begin anew, when your treatments are done. You may pick up right where you left off, or you may decide that everything is wrong and you want to change it all. One word of caution, go slowly into your new you. Step by step you will figure it all out, but right now, the only thing you need to concentrate on is healing. Go, heal, breath, know that we have all been through it and you will be ok too. You really will be ok, different, but ok. {{{Hugs}}} we are all holding on to you. Sinee",

Any ways have them check for that too...especially if you have been around someone who is ill. Hope that is what it is, because they can give you a high dose of antibiotics and a good rest~love to you, and let us know.. sinee",

I seem to average 4-6 hours and that is all. Did anyone else have this problem and what did you do? I've already tried, teas, and lavendar, and relaxing tapes, all the Guru stuff~nothing helps...just tell me it ends in 6 months or so. I hate the idea of a sleeping pill, but now that I am back to work I have to get some sleep. Idea's sisters, idea's....thanks, Sinee",
