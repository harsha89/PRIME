    "Content": "I was just diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer.  I had a lumpectomy that showed 2 types of breast cancer.....ductal and lobular.  Unable to get all of the cancer, I am having a mastectomy on January 24.  I have spoken to many women who have had reconstruction but I have only found one woman who wears a prothesis.  I am 74 and very active.....feel \"young\".  I have no other health problems.   I would like to find someone in this age group who choose reconstruction and another who has chosen to use a prothesis after surgery.   At this point I do not know if I will need chemo or radiation after surgery. I hope there is someone I can communicate with about these 2 approaches to post nmastectomy in my age group. Thank you Bajube",
