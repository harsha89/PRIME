    "Content": "Dear NewOne 39, Sounds like we are in the same place with this horrible disease.  I have a port.  Couldn't stand to see it in my chest (at first).  Soon I began to appreciate how safe, comfortable and easy it is for receiving medicine.  Now I am glad that I have it. I have been on the same drugs as you.  Currently on Nabelbine.  The drugs that I have been on have made my cancer stable.   Like you, I have been advised that I will be on chemo. on-going.  Unlike you, I have been told that it is possible to have this disease as a chronic, stable condition.  Right now Triple neg. BC is getting a lot of attenetion in  research.  I believe that there will be a treatment for this disease within two years. I do not let \"my head\" or anyone/anything else tell me that I will not survive.  My reasoning is that I will never, ever, let cancer take away my tenacious spirit and determination.  To me, it is like fighting evil.  The going is tough...but you never ever give in. I currently undergo chemo. most weeks.  I still go to the gym, visit with my friends, travel, have fun with my husband and most importantly I Live every day of my life.  Cancer will never take this away from me. Sending hugs and smiles - You Can and Will get through this. Namaste    ",
