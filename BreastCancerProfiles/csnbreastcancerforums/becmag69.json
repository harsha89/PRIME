    "Content": "I had surgery June 10th & thank you all for the best wishes! It was as if I felt support from you! My surgery went well. Had a lumpecomy & 2 lymph nodes removed which were noncancerous. I had the best care from the nurses, doctors, surgeon, & staff. I've been ok. Taking Vicoden every 4hrs. I had been swollen & numb but yesterday I began to feel a different kind of pain. As if the numbness was subsiding & I began to have this burning sensation under my armpit. Its not unbearable but not pleasant. Wasn't expecting it...what else should I expexpect? What else did you girls experience? I can't say my bday, June 11, was a blast but I'm here...healing & resting. I am such a lucky woman to have a husband that is taking care of me 24hrs a day. He's made all the meals, laundry, helps me shower, & has been such a great emotional support. He was able to work from home this week which has made it easier on me. He doest let me do anything:-) It is kind of driving me crazy that I can't do the things I usually do. In a week I see my surgeon & will know the results from pathology. From there its radiation. How is that going to be? Thanks again for all your support, bday wishes, advice, & encouraging words! :-) Becca",
