    "Content": "Hi, I'm 28 years old now, and I was diagnozed with breast cancer a year ago. Everything is still vivid in my mind. I was also six months pregnant and just married when I found all these out! I couldn't sleep at first, then I prayed to God and he calmed me to sleep. The worst thought I had was will I be able to see my child born. I was fortunate for all the wonderful people and support I had from my doctor, nurse, husband and parents. Yes, I was the same very scared, but I talked with my doctor and nurse to find out all the positive possibilities out there, but I didn't know how to react to all the other people in the world. I guess the hardest part was waiting for all the results. My breast cancer was at the very beginging stage, so I was recovered from it after having lumpectumy,chemo and radiation. I just want you to know that I was among many women that had breast cancer, and I have gone through it all, it wasn't the worst,the worst is the people at places that can't get medical help or any support. It's always good to have the breast screened early. Early screening saves life. At this stage, don't worry too much, I hope and I will pray for you that your result will come out negative.",
