      "Content": "I have a combined insurance of a Blue Cross/Blue Shield with Medicare. Some physicians here do not want Medicare because of some unknown reason.  But health insurance plans have their own demons too.  I have had fought with them because of their lateness or lack of response.  Hope you solve the problem.  I gat a lot of Medicare/Triple S plan letters and have found a lot of code errors.  When physicians correct the billing codes, they get paid.",
