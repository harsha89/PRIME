      "Content": "I am 39 and was feeling better than i have in my life until Jan. I have 3 beautiful kids 17,15,12 and a wonderful loving husband. I ran the Indy mini marathon 3 yrs in a row and still run everyday, eat right, ect.... I felt my lump right before xmas (what a time) so of course i did nothing until after. They said breast cancer, i said not me i feel to good they said yes. I have had two surgery's the first one margins did not come back clean, no lymph nodes involed, no chemo just radation. i am in my 3rd week and feel so tired when i get home from work all i want to do is sleep. i feel like i am missing out on my childern let alone my husband. I just want me back the way i was. i know i will get there it will just take time... i could go on for hours. Keep up the Fight to all.. Thanks Leenie",
