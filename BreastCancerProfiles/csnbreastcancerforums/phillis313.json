    "Content": "Hi Jeanne, I'm really new on Tamoxifen. Started it in Jan '09. Can't say that I've noticed too many side affects. Can't really determined if side affects are from other things. I had maybe one or two hot flashes at night, but now I really can't see any. I'm wondering if it's working. I read somewhere where if you have experienced the flashes, that there's a lower reoccurance of cancer. Can't tell you where I read that, but anyway, good luck. So far, no complaints. I've been tired, but can't tell if it's my lifestyle currently or the drug, too many variables. Take Care! Lisa",
