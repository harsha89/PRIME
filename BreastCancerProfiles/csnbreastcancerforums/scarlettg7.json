    "Content": "I just started taking my arimidex a few weeks ago & now have some serious side effects such as hands & feet going numb & tingly, my right hand is the worst though, also noticing some joint pains & more frequently uti's as well. I know that my paper said there would be some crazy side effects but if anyone out there is experiencing anything like this I'd love to hear your stories & what you did to help fix it, or what did your onc tell to try ? I don't go back for my first f/u cat scan til october so Im gonna stick with it for a while longer unles the symptons get worse, would love to here anyone elses stories regarding ARIMIDEX & did you find releif with trying some else, thanks to all who reply, SCARLETT.",
