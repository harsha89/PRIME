      "Content": "I thought of it as peripheral neuropathy in my mouth. Every treatment it felt like my mouth/tongue were tingling/asleep. My oncologist said (not helpfully) that it was not a normal reaction to chemotherapy, and that perhaps it was a calcium deficiency. However, looking at this makes me think it's more common than I thought. I had TC rather than AC, so maybe this is caused by the C part? I did not get sores in my mouth and hope yours are healing. The good news about all the side effects is that they do finally end. My last chemo was 5/18, and I think by 3 weeks out I was feeling mostly normal again, except for the hair. My hair has started to grow back though, so now instead of baldy, my husband and kids call me fuzzy! Good luck with your chemo. This too shall pass. Stephanie",

      "Content": "I see in a lot of the posts that people are having re-occurrences. I'm so sorry to hear it. Can I ask whether or not any of you experiencing this were taking tamoxifen? My dr is recommending it and I have typically gone with their recommendations, but the side effects sound pretty miserable. I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts on this. Stephanie",

      "Content": "For me the side effects were cyclical, but totally do-able. Just had a couple of bad days (about days 4-6) of each cycle and then pretty much back to normal. Chemo for me was much more manageable than recovering from the surgeries. Best of luck. Stephanie",
