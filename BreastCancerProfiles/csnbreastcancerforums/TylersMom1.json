      "Content": "Hi, My hair came back baby fine but the same color. It also came back very curly. My onco said the curls would probably go away in 6 months or so but I still have them (it has been about 9 months). The texture of being baby fine lasted about 6 months and now it feels like my old hair. As my hairdresser says, \"A lot of people pay good money to get the curls I now have\". I would rather have paid the money then gotten them the way I did! I know I am just happy to have hair again! God bless...Cheryl",
