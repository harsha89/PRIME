    "Content": "I was 27 years old the first time I attended a support group. As helpful as the group was, I felt very isolated being a young woman in that setting. The help came from the older survivors sharing the personal and in some cases intimate details about how to deal with the loss of a breast, the process of dealing with this on an emotional and physical level. There is a lot you can learn from the younger victims of this vicious disease and I am willing to share more input if you are interested.",
