    "Content": "Dear CSN community,I need your help! A bit of background: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April of 2005. Had a radical mastectomy, breast reconstruction, was on tamoxifen for years, and then in Feb of 2008 I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. I had chemo (taxol and avastin) for 10 months (3 weeks on, one off), and I am currently on Avastin every 3 weeks. I'm 45; have 2 daughters (10 and 8). My ex-husband left me a couple of months after the second diagnosis. I am on long term disability, able to work half time. I am in the middle of a horrific contested divorce. And here is what I am facing: - during the marriage I have been the higher income making; now because of the LTD, my salary has been reduced significantly. - my ex wants everything: he wants to keep the marital house; he wants for me to pay more than half of the marital debt, he wants to get spousal maintenance; he wants me to pay for all of our daughter's expenses, etc... - For my ex to keep all that he wants, my ex's lawyer is making the following 2 arguments (we have a court hearing on July 9). He is saying: a) given my diagnosis, my live expectancy is so short that it makes no sense for me to insist in keeping my assets (which, by the way, are just my retirement account and half of the equity of the marital house) or b) I am not sick enough to be on disability, and need to go back to working full time so that I can continue to support my ex's. (By the way, he is a high school teacher, and works a second job as chef) I was forced to make all my medical records available to my ex's lawyer. And now, as he continues to a) question my need to be on LTD, or b) hopes to find out how many years I have to life, he is going to get a deposition from my oncologist. he has also requested a deposition from me. So, here is the help that I hope I can find among you: are you aware of any legal services that I could have access to in order to stop this abuse? Are there any family lawyers who specialize in divorce of cancer patients? Should I be posting this in a different forum? If so, where? Thanks for listening, and I look forward to hearing from you.
