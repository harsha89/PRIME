I seem to be falling apart, cry every day, and wake up every night from 3 to 5 am.I have found keeping busy doing anything helps.(Not much to do in the middle of the night!)

I was very surprised how attached I got to it. Perhaps Fluffy and Strawberry will meet in iguana heaven. 12 years is a long time to love and care for an iguana. You must be a very good 'mommy'.",
