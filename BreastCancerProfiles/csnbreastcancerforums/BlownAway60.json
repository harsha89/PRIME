I am Her2 positive as are a lot of ladies on these boards. The most common treatment for Her2 is Herceptin for a year. It is given as an infusion, sometimes along with chemo and continuning afterward for a year total. It does not make you sick like chemo does. The side effects can be a reduced heart function but while under treatment you will be tested every 3 months to make sure there are no problems. I was told that it is better to be positive than negative because there are specialized treatments for us. I had a lumpectomy, 6 rounds of chemo, 33 rads, took Herceptin for a year and am currently taking Femara for 3 1/2 more years, 5 years total. I am 2 years past dx. Donna",

So he just followed what I had planned and everything came out fine. Gotta love him he did everything from baking the cookies to browining the dinner rolls and he is only 13. He even brought me a present just from him. Could not eat much of the food. Couldn't taste any of it anyway. I had a cup of yogurt after everyone left. This is my first sorta good day since Chemo but I am hoping to feel much better soon. Not sure what my onc has planned now since I am having so much trouble with chemo. This one was the worst and not sure I can handle another. He told his assistant when I called them to tell them I was in the hospital that he was going to have to rethink my Chemo. I just hope it is for the better. Donna",

Your mom may never be exactly the same as she was before her dx. Cancer affects the mind as well as the body. Does your mom plan on have reconstruction? If not she could get a prostessis(SP). I was lucky enough to have a lumpectomy. Check with you local American Cancer Society, I think they offer classes Feel Good Look Better or something like that, that help with makeup and self image. I was diagnosed in 2009 and there are times when I still am concerned about what my future is going to be like. I feel like I am a better person now than before I was dxd. I crochet hats and donate them to local chemo clinics. I would never have even thought about doing something like that until I went through chemo and lost all of my hair. Just let her know that you are there for her if she needs you. Recommend this site to her. There are a lot of wonderful people here that will help her trough this.   Hugs and Prayers for you both Donna ",

      "Content": "We went yesterday for our first visit with my Radiation Oncologist. He discussed just about everything and answered all of my questions. I will probably have 33 treatments. The last week will be boosters. He said that he will also give me radiation in the level one and two lymph nodes but only about half the way up my chest wall, not all the way to my collar bone. Radiation will be given using IMRT. They will use a CT and computer to map the path that the arc takes around me. Using IMRT they will be able to adjust the intensity of the beams in the areas that should not be radiated like my heart and lungs and such. They are supposed to call me today with an appointment for my first simulation. Which is supposed to take about 2 hours. I guess they will make my cast, do the CT Scan and maybe mark me during that session. I know they do another simulation before they actually start rads to make sure everthing is aligned correctly. Kinda anxious to get going with this. The sooner it starts the sooner I will be done. Just a little scared as I have read post about the problems some are having with rads. Just praying that I will be okay and be able put this behind me soon. Looking forward to dancing with NED. Will keep you all updated as time goes by. Hugs Donna",
