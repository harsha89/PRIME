    "Content": "My 1st DX i worked through all the chemo. My co workers were very helpful as they saw that i was very fatigued not my usual get it done self. I worked in a nursing home at that time. Then went home to three young children. The 2nd DX i worked as a meter reader for the city. I walked 5-10 miles 5 days a week through chemo and radiation. I stayed healthy for the most part by washing my hands a million times a day. That is the single most effective way for anyone to stay healthy. You can do this. It may seem at times that it will never end but lots of women do it. It's possible as the Drs have so many wonderful meds for side effects. Don't be afraid to ask for them. Hugs for you",
