      "Content": "Hi Carol! I have had left-side groin pain for 2 yrs. It started the month I took Tamoxifen. However, I only took Tamoxifen for 9 mos., but the groin pain has continued. I had finished Taxol treatments 3 mos. prior. (Adriamycin/Cytoxin before that.) Hadn't thought that Taxol could be responsible. Definitely, something to think about. I don't recall having any shooting pains in that area. Mine are aching pains which are somewhat alleviated by heat &/or pressure. The first time I had the pain, it was painful (& scary) enough that I went to the OB-GYN that day. He said there was nothing gynecologically wrong. To shut me up, my ex-Oncologist said I had a urinary tract infection (even tho the urine test did not show this!), so he gave me antibiotics. I didn't have a urinary tract infection! The ache is more noticeable lying down. Standing or walking I don't notice it. Fortunately, the aching is much more tolerable now, but I still would like to know what's causing it! I am going to continue asking all the doctors. Maybe one will provide the answer. If so, I'll let you know! Take care, Geral",

      "Content": "Hi Ink! Thanx for suggestions on resources on writing your own will and for the info on blood donation. I wasn't aware of the chemo/radiation restrictions. Good to know. I did 'opt' for organ donation before cancer. After my diagnosis of bc, I spoke with a guy who worked for an organ sharing program. He said that I could still become an organ donor even tho I have bc. He did mention a couple of health status exceptions in becoming a donor, but I don't remember them. Anyway, I'm still leaning toward donating my body to science. I still haven't heard from the anatomical society about the details. I'm not planning on 'going anywhere' anytime soon, but I'd like to take care of what I can now. It would make things easier on my family when the time comes and make me feel better now knowing that. One of the big issues about cancer is the feeling of not being in control. These are a couple of things I can control. I hope you too are feeling well! Take care, Geral",
