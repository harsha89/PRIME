      "Content": "Jean, So good to see you post...I had this funny feeling something was wrong. I'm sorry you have to deal with this now...it's always something with this disease. I go tomorrow for chemo and scheduled to see the doctor. He asks how are you doing...and I would just like to have one week that I could say \"fine\" but I always seem to have something new pop up week to week. Other than all you went through this past week how is everything else going. Have you been scanned lately...are treatments working. You continue to be im my prayers and it sounds like your back to your old self. It pays to be assertive. Warmly, Judie",
