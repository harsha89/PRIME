    "Content": "Monica, Hi, I'm new to this site but am thrilled to hear your news! I had a bilateral (left side prophylactic) mastectomy November 9 with 13 of 15 lymph nodes positive on the right side---Stage III. Your hubby sounds awesome and I have been lucky to have one as well. He drained all 3 of mine up till the very end, and actually pulled the last 2 out himself. I cried after not out of pain but for having to put him through all this **** (sorry bout my potty mouth, is that allowed here?). I had a 6.5 cm tumor in the right side, but I guess \"lucky\" for me I had DDD breasts before and it hadn't gotten into the chest wall. But the lymph thing sucks. Means I've got a lot of \"seeds\" floating around in me (the onco compared it to grass seeds in dormancy) so gotta go hard on the chemo in about 2 weeks. How far into this journey are you? Best wishes on continued success! Love, Sharon",
