      "Content": "Decisions to make????  There is cancer in one of my breasts and I am defintely having a mastectomy on that breast.  I am considering having a double mastectomy for various reasons.  Doctor said not totally necessary to do a double mastectomy, but my choice.  Cancer risk goes down about 2 percent with doing a double mastectomy.  Has anyone ever had to make this decision?  What did you do?  After talking to one doctor, he said that he's never had a woman come back and say they regretted having had a double mastectomy, but he has had them come back after  having a unilateral and wished they would've done a double.   There's pros and cons to both.     I would appreciate anyone's input, please.  ",
