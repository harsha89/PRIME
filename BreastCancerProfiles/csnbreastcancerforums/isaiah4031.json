(Praising God that I finally found the chat room!!) I am so computer illiterate sometimes! Anyway, I just wanted to wish you all a wonderful new year, complete with hope, love, and good health. You all have given me so much encouragement, support, love, and help when I needed it so much. I praise the Lord for you all and lift you up in prayer before Him. Again, have a blessed new year and when y'all get a chance...let's chat! Love, Jayne",

      "Content": "Just received word from my doc that my liver enzymes are more elevated. He wants me to go to a liver specialist. Said that it might be a \"fatty\" liver. I don't know if that is good or bad at this point, but this is the first time he mentioned the specialist. Funny, the first thing I think about is some type of terminal liver disease and praying that I am healthy for my daughter's wedding next May. Any thoughts on the liver thing? My doc says if I loose weight that should help...only problem with that is that that is a problem I've battled all my life. I'm not sure I know how to loose weight...plus the Tamoxifen doesn't help in that area either. Any info in these areas would be appreciated. I continue to hold you all up in prayer. I may not know exactly where the path I am on is headed, but I know whose hand I'm holding. Have a blessed day... Love, Jayne",

      "Content": "My dear friends, I haven't posted on the site in a while, but I have been reading your notes. They continue to uplift and encourage me. I am doing well. Finished chemo and radiation. I have lots of aches and pains that I didn't have before, but it's endurable. I just wanted to share a funny thing. I am a middle school teacher and this week was school spirit week. Today was crazy hair day. I have a nice head of short hair again...incredibly curly (I always had straight hair and envied all those who had the natural curls, so I am pleased as punch!) Anyway, I chose to wear a silly wig that I bought for my chemo days. Much to my dismay, it was so much easier to wear when I was bald! I got a good chuckle at having to struggle to get the wig on. It was a long red haired one...I'm a short curly salt and pepper now. Anyway, I just wanted to let all of you know that I am able to laugh at so much again and it feels so good. God has blessed me greatly. Both of my children are getting married, so that is what is occupying my time when I'm not working. I am so happy that I am able to be at their weddings and I plan to be around to see many grandchildren! I guess I just wanted to tell all the new ladies that things do get better. The road has been really rough a long the way (and much rougher for so many others) but the journey has brought me so much...new friends, new priorities, and a deeper trust and relationship with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Hang in there! There is hope and peace inspite of cancer. You continue to be in my prayers. Love, Jayne",

Said it was something like \"Parodel\" I looked that up and it is also a Parkinson's med. However, the OB nurse said they stopped using it because of it's cancer causing problems....Hope that helps you. I'll try and do some more research. If I find anything else out, I'll let you know.
