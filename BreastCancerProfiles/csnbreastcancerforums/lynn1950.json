I freaked out at the tiniest cut on my bc side (left) arm. Then, I went to get my first flu shot ever and obediently rolled up my left sleeve, received the shot, and then just about fainted from fear and loathing in the doctor's office! But nothing bad happened. I was fine. And I did not get the flu. It's been a year now. It took me a while to stop associating all my symptoms with cancer: that the numbness on that side is not cancer; that the achiness and pain in my arm and chest area is not cancer; that the occasional swelling is not cancer. I got my toenails manicured in late August. I know it's silly, but I have loved watching my toenails grow until now all that's left is a little strip of vermillion at the very ends of my big toes. In a twisted way, it gives me the same thrill as seeing the first crocus in spring. OK, now you all know just how twisted I am! : ) These days I sometimes wear my sleeve; I know I will when I fly. I wear a sports bra if under my arm feels like it's a little swollen. The compression feels good. I plan to go back to my lymphedema specialist over winter break to see if she can help break up some of the scar tissue that is causing the stiffness and aches and pains. It's OK to relax and glory in the miracle that we are alive. xoxoxoxo Lynn",

Should I just have had a lumpectomy....well, I'm glad I went with the mastectomies and in the end my surgeon agreed with me. This isn't a right/wrong answer question.

I had Neulasta for the A/C, but was able to give myself Neupogen shots for the Taxol. Neupogen is a lot less expensive. I think it was one shot a day for three or four days after chemo. Where I live is very rural and I needed to have the shots on the weekend; that's why I gave them to myself. It's a lot like how diabetics give themselves shots and it is not painful. I remember that I developed \"hand -foot syndrome\" about the time I started Taxol, but it was from the Adriamycin. It is preventable...keep your hands and feet moist with Aveeno, don't let them get hot (use tepid water), and avoid friction. I am sure that others on this board will have a schedule similar to yours. xoxoxoxo Lynn",

With the addition of Arimidex (which I now have been taking since rads were completed last October), my chances of 5 year survival increased from the 50something % to 86%. Have the doctors talked about taking anti-cancer drugs once you are finished with rads? I too had AC-T (dose dense). It's not a picnic, but you can do it. You will want to have a port put in. It's a disk about 25% smaller than the dimensions of an Oreo cookie placed under your skin beneath your collar bone. Then instead of having to poke you with IVs, you can have blood drawn, tests done, and chemo infused through the port. It really saves your arm veins. A cream called EMLA (lidocaine) can be coated on the port area an hour before it's time to access it, and then you will not even feel a poke! Keep coming here with your questions. We will help all we can. ♥Lynn",
