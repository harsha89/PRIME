      "Content": "Hi, I have been reading through the past posts and have not seen this question before. I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction on Dec 5. When I went to the plastic surgeon for my first visit a week later I was told that I would need to go back to the hospital to have some skin that died and turned black removed and resutured.. I am ashamed to say that I didn't ask a whole a lot of questions, I guess I was in shock and my mind kept thinking... more surgery??? No, please no more cutting and so soon after the mastectomy.... the only thing I was told is that this happens to one in six patients and it is considered a complication of the surgery. Can anyone tell me if they have gone through this and what to expect afterward? Does it delay healing time? Is there more pain? Should I be more worried than I already am? The procedure is scheduled for Dec 23... Thanks... Dot",
