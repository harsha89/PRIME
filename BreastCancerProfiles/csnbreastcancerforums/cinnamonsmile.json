You have to be able to leave the house to get to doctor appointments,right?  Do you have a wheelchair and/or walker? If you don't have a wheel chair, talk to your doctor about. Same goes to having a walker. They make walkers you can sit on (you could sit on your walker while your husband pulls up the car). You are not alone in bad things happening.

Amitriptyline(an anti-depressant) works as a pain reliever for some and helps promote sleep if pain is interfering with sleep. Tramadol is a pain reliever made to replace Vicodin as it is not supposed to be addictive. There are creams and patches available as well. There are also pain treatments available. I have had  stillete ganglion nerve block shots to the neck to combat my nerve damage pain in my upper arms, full chest, sides of chest, armpits, and around my back from the bottom of the rib cage up. They are dangerous and painful. Since 2011, I have been getting IV Lidocaine infusions since 2011. If you are having pain difficulties and not finding relief from your regular doctors, I advise seeing a pain clinic. But remember when finding pain treatments, it is trial and error to find what works best for you. Not everyone responds the same to pain treatments and medications. Be aware that most pain medications come with side effects, so make sure you discuss those with your doctors or look them up online at a reputable website.",

Return to top A person should not get shingles vaccine who: has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. has a weakened immune system because of AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system; treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids; cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy; cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.   Someone with a minor illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3 °F (38.5 °C) or higher.(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a607025.html) Gov. website doesn't say WHY it isn't insurance approved for people under 50. However, I did some digging and found this reason. Whether or not the site is totally credible, I don't know but here is one reason I found, It is from a website where someone who is 59  was asking about why people under 50 can't get the vaccination. Here is the doctor's reply in two parts (http://www.justanswer.com/medical/4fn9m-can-t-shingles-vaccine-age-60-several.html): Hello,The reason for it not being recommended for use in people under 60 years of age is 1. Out of the total number of people suffering from shingles 50 % or more are of gae greater than 60 2. And the safety and its effects were only studied in people of age greater than 60 So if you try it before this age than it would be on your own risk & is definitely not recommended. Hope this answered your Question R Regards Dr MASK Second part: Ok let me explain it this way When ever a new drug, Vaccine or treatment is started there are trials for it much before its launch and these trials are meant for the safety of people that are going to use it in the future. Its safety is not documented at your age group. So if you press your MD to give it to you and he does and some unforeseen complication comes up then not only will you suffer but so would the MD, as for him he may loose his license for having performed a procedure (administration of the vaccine) that was not recommended for his patient (you) Hope this helped Regards Dr MASK Here is a link to an NPR segment on the vaccine: http://www.npr.org/2011/01/17/132935345/few-opt-for-vaccine-to-prevent-painful-shingles  Here is something from the CDC from 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/shingles/hcp-vaccination.htm) and states \" Vaccination of persons age 50 through 59 years In 2011, FDA expanded the age indication for Zostavax® to include adults 50 through 59 years old for preventing herpes zoster. This decision was based on a large study showing that the vaccine reduced the risk of herpes zoster by approximately 70 percent. For persons age 50 through 59 years, the risk of getting shingles and having prolonged pain after shingles is much lower than for people 60 years and older. In the past several years, there have been shortages and delays in getting Zostavax®. Based on such considerations, ACIP is not issuing a recommendation for routine use of zoster vaccine in adults 50 through 59 years at this time. However, health care providers can still offer herpes zoster vaccine to patients 50 through 59 years. Health care providers may want to first consider whether the patient would have poor tolerance to herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia symptoms. For example, if the patient has preexisting chronic pain, severe depression, or other co-morbidities intolerance to treatment medications due to hypersensitivity or interactions with other medications extenuating employment-related factors No data are available about the effectiveness of zoster vaccine in adults who become immunosuppressed after their vaccination.\" Basically it sounds to me like the vaccine is very expensive. I found one quote that it is around $162 U.S. per shot. I really can't find a clear reason why younger people can't get the shot other than the quotes by \"Dr. Mask\" I did find it interesting and very important as to who should NOT get the shot. I hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Unfortunately I don't have the best of news. I continue to have pain, which I guess is normal for a thoracotomy for 6-12 months after surgery. I have seen the 2 different PA's now and the surgeon recently. I told the first PA (the full of himself idiot that didn't know he shouldn't be wearing so much cologne when he enters the room of patients who just had lung surgery...which I came right out and told him that he had too much cologne on and it was making it hard for me to breathe...I have never smelled cologne on him again!!) that I kept feeling a flapping when I would inhale and exhale...his repsonse.hmmm, never heard of it and told me to come back in a month. Saw the 2nd surgeon PA, told him that I felt flapping on inhale and exhale..hmmm..never hear of it. But this guy looked at my incision (I haven't seen it, but am told I definitely got my money's worth. I have no desire to see it.  He had me breathe and felt my rib cage. According to him, I have a bone that flaps when I breathe in certain positions, mainly when I am laying on my surgical side or on my back. Surgeon came and told me all the pain I am feeling is normal, to remember it is one of the most painful surgeries one can have. He also told me that he had to cut one of my ribs off and open up the cartilage (don't ask me  how, I don't want to know anymore), THEN cut 15% of the lung out. I am not sure if I believe them that the flapping is normal. IF two of them never heard a patient say something was flapping, how can it be normal? I hate when dr.s' logic makes no sense. So...my recent CT scan now shows something on the right lung (just like the left had last February and I was told to ignore it that was nothing). At least this time, I have my allergist AND my lung doctor to go to if I ever get a cough, hoarsenes, and short of breath while talking again. No one can figure out WHY I had such a bad case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

      "Content": "Hi. Thank you for thinking of me. I had a full thoracotomy where they slice your chest open on the side, move the ribs apart and muscles, and deflate the lung so the surgeon can see and work. It is an extremely painful procedure. After the surgery is done, a tube with the circumference of a nickel is inserted with a pump to pump out all the drainage. It makes the tubes after the BMX seem like noodles hanging out. This pump and tube are so painful. Those BMX drains were a piece of cake compared to that. I had lots of needle pokes, none on the right side, so they listened to me. I had a central line in the neck, an IV in the left arm, an IV in the artery for blood pressure in the left (and in case my heart needed meds) and I had an epidural that they left in until Friday. I had my favorite anesthesiologist (who also remembers me) so that went smooth. It is a good thing the surgeon decided to skip the VATS procedure. He was shocked when he opened me up and saw that the mass on my lung was the size of a PLUM!!! No wonder why I was having so many troubles breathing!! Preliminary path says its\u2019 not cancer. To get clean margins plus the mass, the surgeon had to take out 15% of my lung!!!  But I tell  you, I can breathe better with 85% of my lung compared to 100% plus the plum!!! The surgeon said they are going to hopefully figure out what the heck it is. The pain was unbearable and they gave me dilauded after. I have only had it once and it made me sick to my stomach. So they stopped all pain meds. The pain was excruciating, especially because where the incision was and the tubing was where I already have that severe pain that I have had since 1/11/11 from the BMX and sentinel node removal (I had 1 axillary node on the right). Of course I can\u2019t get out of that hospital without problems. Weds night about 10 pm, a nurse and nursing assistant helped me swing around the bed to dangle my legs and sit up. They SHOULD have swung me so I could use the right arm and side to help myself. They swung me on the surgery side and dragged my catheter tubing across the bed. I knew right away something pulled too much. I told the nurse. When I laid back down, she deflated then inflated the tubing. NO ONE checked my urine output for at least 6 hours. There was a leak and I woke up in a bed FULL of urine. They washed me up and sat me in a chair. There were no clean pillow cases on the unit, so I had to steal Brian\u2019s (he slept over night because I was afraid to be alone). First thing I did was call the patient advocate and she brought the head of the unit down. I told them I laid in urine all night and that there were no clean linens, the staff left a bag of urine soaked bedding in my room for over 3 hours. I also informed her that my nurse refused to take my complaints of neuropathy pain from my BMX w/ node removal UNTIL a CAN spoke up and said she had the same on one side. THEN the jerk took me serious. Staff was much better after that with my pain. Got up out of chair, there I had sat again for 5 hours in urine. I told the 1st shift nurse for his 12 hour day shift that something was wrong with the catheter. I was told for 12 hours I was having bladder spasms and told him that was not the problem, that it began when I slid the legs across the bed. On Thursday evening, my walk had to be cancelled because urine was leaking all over the floor. Turns out I was right. I had a nurse check my bed regularly and low and behold, she caught it as it started leaking. Turns out the tubing had connections by my thigh and it was leaking. So, I complained about the tubing and was ignored, meaning I sat or laid in urine soaked bedding from Sometime after 10 pm on Weds. Till Thursday about 2 am when the leak site was found. Thursday I had a meltdown. I felt so afraid to be in the hospital and to make matters worse; I was developing a horrible reaction to the epidural meds. I was sick to my stomach, retching, I felt dizzy but without the head spins, I thought I was going crazy and in extreme pain because they wouldn\u2019t give me anything other than the epidural. On Friday, they took the epidural out. Two hours later, I was sitting up and eating. What a relief. Not all my staff was bad. I had some VERY good nurses and aides. I got home from the hospital around noon on Saturday. I have been using my spirometer for breathing, and out taking walks around the yard with Brian and Cinnamon. Pain is definitely better today than yesterday, although during the day I am still on 2 vicodin every 4 hours, although I may go every 5 or 6 now. I am getting a shower today whooo hoooo cuz I sure need one. And hopefully I will have a BM soon, if not, I get the enema. I still have the enlarged lymph nodes in and will be talking to the surgeon about what to do about those. If they are still enlarged, I think I want them out, but not sure. If the plum sized mass in my lung is some disease or fungus that I need meds for, maybe that will help the nodes on the trachea. Time will tell. I really didn\u2019t get all worked up about this surgery beforehand so I have been really calm. I was NOT calm when they had to keep changing my linens cuz they were soaked with urine, or when I was in the deepest pain and epidural med sickness. I sure was thinking it wasn\u2019t worth it. I knew the chance of it being cancer was slim to none, but didn't freak out thinking into the future like telling myself it was cancer etc. I told myself if it is cancer, then freak out, but no reason to now. My thoracic surgeon took an agressive approach, which is good. He wanted to make sure that I didn't have cancer and to make sure he got clean margins around the lung. I am amazed by how much better I can breathe without the plum in my chest!!!! Even with the post-surgical pain and crap, I can breathe a lot better than before surgery.   Anyway, thanks for asking how things went. Sorry it is so long, but I can\u2019t get out of that hospital without some kind medical mishaps!!! I am not freaking out about the pain because I know it will be temporary. The surgeon already told me I will have new nerve damage on the belly, but I don't feel the pain like I did after the BMX. All the previous surgeries and pain helped me prepare for this one and be pretty calm about the whole thing. My nieghbor/friend said she was even worried about me that I should have been more worked up lol!!! Right now, I make sure I get up, move around, do breathing exercises because pretty soon I will have pickles to can!!! But we forgot to plant dill so hopefully Brian's dad has some extra for me. We planted it late, but it didn't come up. THe seeds might have been too old,too. I still can't believe that I was living with a plum sized mass in my lung. It is mind boggling.",

      "Content": "Jessiemom1. It would appear that BIRADS looks for at least two things: abnormalities in the breast AND breast density. I am thinking that a D paired with a 4 means that the Density of the breast is at a level 4 meaning that the breast is extremely dense. I am assuming that there was also something suspicious found that indicates a need for a biopsy. http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/examsandtestdescriptions/mammogramsandotherbreastimagingprocedures/mammograms-and-other-breast-imaging-procedures-mammo-report Mammograms and Other Breast Imaging Procedures +-Text Size   Download Printable Version [PDF]»   TOPICS Document Topics What is a mammogram?

Breast biopsy Mammogram reports \u2013 BI-RADS Mammograms in special circumstances Improving mammograms Other breast imaging tests Experimental and other breast imaging methods To learn more References GO »   SEE A LIST »   Previous Topic Breast biopsy   Next Topic Mammograms in special circumstances Mammogram reports \u2013 BI-RADS The American College of Radiology (ACR) has developed a standard way of describing mammogram findings. In this system, the results are sorted into categories numbered 0 through 6. This system is called the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Having a standard way of reporting mammogram results lets doctors use the same words and terms and ensures better follow up of suspicious findings. Here\u2019s a brief review of what the categories mean: X-ray assessment is incomplete Category 0: Additional imaging evaluation and/or comparison to prior mammograms is needed. This means a possible abnormality may not be clearly seen or defined and more tests are needed, such as the use of spot compression (applying compression to a smaller area when doing the mammogram), magnified views, special mammogram views, or ultrasound. This also suggests that the mammogram should be compared with older ones to see if there have been changes in the area over time. X-ray assessment is complete Category 1: Negative There\u2019s no significant abnormality to report. The breasts look the same (they are symmetrical) with no masses (lumps), distorted structures, or suspicious calcifications. In this case, negative means nothing bad was found. Category 2: Benign (non-cancerous) finding This is also a negative mammogram result (there\u2019s no sign of cancer), but the reporting doctor chooses to describe a finding known to be benign, such as benign calcifications, lymph nodes in the breast, or calcified fibroadenomas. This ensures that others who look at the mammogram will not misinterpret the benign finding as suspicious. This finding is recorded in the mammogram report to help when comparing to future mammograms. Category 3: Probably benign finding \u2013 Follow-up in a short time frame is suggested The findings in this category have a very good chance (greater than 98%) of being benign (not cancer). The findings are not expected to change over time. But since it\u2019s not proven benign, it\u2019s helpful to see if an area of concern does change over time. Follow-up with repeat imaging is usually done in 6 months and regularly thereafter until the finding is known to be stable (usually at least 2 years). This approach helps avoid unnecessary biopsies, but if the area does change over time, it allows for early diagnosis. Category 4: Suspicious abnormality \u2013 Biopsy should be considered Findings do not definitely look like cancer but could be cancer. The radiologist is concerned enough to recommend a biopsy. The findings in this category can have a wide range of suspicion levels. For this reason, some doctors may divide this category further: finding with a low suspicion of being cancer finding with an intermediate suspicion of being cancer finding of moderate concern of being cancer, but not as high as Category 5 Not all doctors use these subcategories. Category 5: Highly suggestive of malignancy \u2013 Appropriate action should be taken The findings look like cancer and have a high chance (at least 95%) of being cancer. Biopsy is very strongly recommended. Category 6: Known biopsy-proven malignancy \u2013 Appropriate action should be taken This category is only used for findings on a mammogram that have already been shown to be cancer by a previous biopsy. Mammograms may be used in this way to see how well the cancer is responding to treatment. BI-RADS reporting for breast density Mammogram reports can also include an assessment of breast density. BI-RADS classifies breast density into 4 groups: BI-RADS 1: The breast is almost entirely fat This means that fibrous and glandular tissue makes up less than 25% of the breast BI-RADS 2: There are scattered fibroglandular densities Fibrous and glandular tissue makes up from 25 to 50% of the breast. BI-RADS 3: The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense The breast has more areas of fibrous and glandular tissue (from 51 to 75%) that are found throughout the breast. This can make it hard to see small masses (cysts or tumors). BI-RADS 4: The breast tissue is extremely dense The breast is made up of more than 75% fibrous and glandular tissue. This can lead to missing some cancers. In some states, the summary of the mammogram report that is sent to patients (sometimes called the lay summary) must contain information about breast density. This information may be worded in lay language instead of the BIRADS categories. Women whose mammograms show BI-RADS 3 or 4 for breast density may be told that they have \u201cdense breasts.\u201d",

I wanted to cry so bad but I can't cuz there is a 6 inch needle in my neck putting in the medicine that makes me feel better and is imperative that the anesthesiologist gets in the right spot for maximum relief. Luckily, my partner and the nurse in training saw my hands flopping looking for a hand to put in it, one on the right and one on the left. It was canned peaches tonight for supper since they swallow easy. The med itself makes swallowing difficult and the pressure put on my trachea to move it out of the way makes my throat feel bruised. I love my pain dr. He tried to make me feel better by giving me the positives but also letting me know they may or may not apply to me. I like that. However, he is going on vacation for a month. I have seen one of the others, but this guy is my fave and I like how his shots go in. I am trying to be calm about it, but man, a whole month without him seems like forever, but I am sure when he's back it will have been a piece of a cake...Thanks for letting me get it out.",

And make sure since you are allergic to so many other pain meds, that that young doc. of yours has something stronger for you to take than just tylenol! Some women need pain meds after a mastectomy and some don't. I would hate for you to suffer thru needlessly. This is something you definitely don't want to \"suffer thru it\" til it gets better. There has to be SOMETHING he can give you. Don't forget about the camisoles with the drain pouches too. They really do come in handy and feel good, at least it did for me. Don't forget all those other tips I gave you when we chatted that one night. If you need them again, let me know and I can get in touch with you again. The DCIS, ductal carcinoma in situ, is a cancer that resides in the milk ducts and is the earliest form of cancer, actually stage 0. That is what I had. I hope your invasive cancer is not spread very much and hope it has not spread to the lymph nodes. Please be aware that just because you are getting a mastectomy does NOT GUARANTEE you of being rad or chemo free. That depends on your margins and lymph nodes. Some surgeons might not make that clear enough to the patients. Hope to chat with you before your surgery, if not, I wish you all the best, good surgeon skills, little apin and a good recovery!",

BI-RADS density is a subjective measure used by radiologists to classify a mammogram as follows: D1: Fatty; D2: Scattered density; D3: Heterogeneously dense; or D4: Extremely dense. Computer assisted methods are used to estimate quantitative measures of MBD, including percent density (percentage of the overall breast showing dense tissue; PD), absolute dense area, and non-dense area (3)(16).",

I had to that were wonderful for that. I kept complaining about feeling swollen,achey,a feeling like I had wide rubber bands on the back of my upper arms and chest side. She would take arm measurements but do nothing. My last day of OT, she finally heard me about LE symptoms and gave me maybe 5 minutes of instructions of how to massage my arm and dismissed me. I have been lurking around the LE section on breastcancer.org. I found that there were no certified LE therapists near me (closest was almost 3 hours away). I have been telling my family dr.,my pain dr and nurses about LE symptoms (my breast surgeon moved away and I don't have an oncologist). Well, this summer my lower spine was hurting so bad I could hardly move, so I started PT for that. I got curious about the others that worked there and was reading all their info cards. I stumbled upon a woman who is part of the pilot program for cancer rehab for those that had or have cancer and need PT/OT for whatever AND it includes an individual exercise program. I was talking to my back PT about it and low and behold....that lady knows LE and how to treat it. At my last family dr. appt she wrote me a prescription for the Cancer Stepping Stones and LE. The LE therapist happened to be at the front desk when I was making my first appt (the PT dept I am using is below my family dr). She took one look at me and could see I was swollen in the arm and the side truncal area. Today was my first appt. and yup, I have LE. She did massaging on my chest and arms. I started using the pump, too for 30 minutes. She doesn't have any sleeves in my size, so she is ordering one for me. I am so relieved to finally have found someone. So in addition to the severe PMPS, I officially have LE that I have known I have had for a year. I also consider myself very lucky that it stayed a mild case and didn't turn severe. So I now joined the LE club....",
