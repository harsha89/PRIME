I'm on day 10 after my first chemo and I need to know what are the signs to look for or feel to know if my hair is going to go soon? I have had every side effect that you could have and just when I thought I was going to get through this week with some energy, I now have a very bad cold that has settled in my chest with a cough. I was going to go today and get my head shaved but haven't been able to do anything for being so sick. Thanks for any info. Pat",

      "Content": "This is not my first post but my diagnosis just gets harder to take every day and now I have made a decision that I hope is the right one. Originally, after getting dx with stage 2 invasive bc I decided my hubby & I would go ahead and go on our trip to the NW section of the USA and then start having treatment in October. Everyone I know has called and begged me to go now to get treated but I figured if this thing had been in my body for possibly years, what is the rush now. Then my primary care doctor (who admits he is not a cancer doctor but he is very intelligent (my words not his)) said what I have is ductal carcinoma which is more like skin cancer than breast cancer and is very dangerous to let go without early treatment. I took that into consideration. Then yesterday went to my first oncology appt just to find out what the rest of the test might have revealed and she informed me that I have triple negative breast cancer. After reading about it on this website and others, it doesn't sound so non aggressive as I had hoped. So...I caved in to my hubbys desires and decided to go to Florida in April to start treatment after I retire 25 March. (My daughter & my brother live there.) So I'm asking advice on two questions: 1. Is triple negative as bad (aggressive) as the articles read? 2. Is anyone on this forum from the Orange Park FL area and have a surgeon and oncologist they recommend? Thanks a million!!! Pat",

I know that they really don't know until they do a biopsy and the results come back, but what I would like to ask is what type of biopsy did anyone have. Also, has anyone decided not to have surgery or treatment?",
