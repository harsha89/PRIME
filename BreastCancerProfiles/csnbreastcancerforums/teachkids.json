      "Content": "Have osteoporosis and am treating bc with Arimidex. Am taking D and calcium. Have been struggling with decision regarding Reclast (doctors are promoting this). Have been taking Fosamax but don't know if it is strong enough to counteract the Arimidex. Am very concerned about the side effects of Reclast and can't get myself to say yes to having it infused. Very difficult decisions. What have you heard ? Doctors I see are pushing Reclast (even twice a year!- sounds excessive but I don't know how quickly Arimidex wears bones away) Let's keep in touch. This is driving me up a wall!!!",

      "Content": "Have had osteoporosis for some time. Arimidex will make it worse. Fosamax is o.k. but I need Reclast for two reasons: to keep hip fractures at bay and to hope that Reclast will keep breast cancer metastasis from occurring. Have not yet started Reclast. Asking a lot of questions, concerned about such a strong medication but there seems to be no other option that will work for both issues! Let me know what you've decided. Best of luck",
