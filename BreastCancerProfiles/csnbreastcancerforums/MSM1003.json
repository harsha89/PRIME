    "Content": "Prayers are sent to you and your family. Yes, four can put cancer in remission. It depends on what kind of cancer you have and the treatment your doctor is fulfilling. I personally have IDC Stage 4 and at first when I was Stage IIIc there were 6 treatments (every three weeks) with Herceptin for a year weekly. Many other patients received four that were E/P positive, but mine was HER-2. It didn't work on me so the journey has continued with another chemo weekly and now daily. This makes the 6th treatment and I feel great. I have seen a lot in the last year and I learn everyday something new. Talk to your doctor and ask questions... God Bless!",
