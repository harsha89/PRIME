      "Content": "Since I got the bad news on Friday that hormonals aren't working on my liver mets, I've been thinking . . . why not get the inevitable over with? Chemo for the rest of my \"life\"? What kind of life is that? It's only my three beautiful, wonderful daughters that are giving me a will to live, and they felt the need to fight with each other all afternoon yesterday. I hated to do it, but I pulled out the \"cancer card\" and explained that I got bad news (they knew) and that I could not tolerate their bickering on top of everything. I think that they're pushing me to reassure themselves that I'm okay . . . like, \"If she punishes us for (fill in the blank) then she's normal.\" I'm too tired. And sad. ~Linda",

I don't know what to tell them about the wig, my time off from school, etc. My administration is being WONDERFUL and supportive, but they're leaving this to me. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Peace, Linda from Baltimore",
