    "Content": "Hello, My name is Nancy and I have had a total of 8 surgeries between both breasts. I have had a partial mastectomy,  following a  Double mastectomy with expanders put in, then removal of left side Expander because it didn't expand due to radiation and another one placed but failed again.  I decided  To do the Latissumus Dorsi flap on left side ( bringing muscle to the front) and then it didn't heal and got an infection,  So another expander was put in and removed, again. And this was all within two years. I had given up but this time my right  Side expander contracted and so I just got it removed and an implant Was placed along with right side expander to try again..but guess what,  I'm leaking again and it looks like it's not healing.  I am grateful that God has given me  a second chance and often think that I'm being selfish, but the truth is that I feel  Less than a woman without my boobs and although My husband says he doesn't care, I care.  And so my 9 year old Boy asks me if I'm crying everyday because I do.  I have a wonderful career and love my family but  I can't help but to feel like a part of me is missing.  Wish me luck.  8'(    ",
