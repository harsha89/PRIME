    "Content": "Hello all! I've spent the last hour reading all your posts and decided to join in. We are all sisters in cancer and I know the value of sticking together and supporting each other!! I'm 67, retired from the business world 2 years ago, and the grandmother of 5. I found my lump by accident on March 28th while showering. Had right breast mastectomy on April 28th. It was a complete success and I'm feeling wonderful. No pain, but the usual numbness still under the arm and above the incision - no big deal. The path report showed that the tumor, it's margins, and the nodes removed are all NEGATIVE for cancer - WOO HOO!!! My stats were: stage 1, grade 3, 1.8mm tumor I am \"Triple Negative\" (ER-, PR-, HER2-) which means any kind of hormonal therapy won't work on me... chemo is the only treatment option available. Had my first meeting with the medical oncologist yesterday (May 14th). Of course she recommended chemo and gave me two options: CMF or TC. I find that most of you on this thread are talking about TC which is fine. Here's my question: (before I ask it, I should say that I've been unable to find any kind of answer to it anywhere on the web, including many other blogs)... WHY SHOULD I EVEN HAVE CHEMO? In 13 years I'll be 80, which, in my opinion is long enough for me to live. In reading everything I could get my hands on today about chemo, I find that the side effects of all these drugs are a risk that I really don't want to take. In my specific type of cancer, I've learned that rogue cells \"MAY\" have broken away from the primary tumor and spread to the blood stream. I'm stuck on \"may have\" - this also means to me that they may NOT have. Thus opting for no treatment makes a certain amount of sense to me. Since I'm very new to this, and I'm sure there's a lot I haven't learned yet, I'd really appreciate hearing about your thought processes when you were told you were going to need chemo. With much gratitude, Terry",
