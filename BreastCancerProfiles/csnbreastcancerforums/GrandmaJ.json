Sat I felt fine...Sun and Monday were days of just feeling like I had the flu....lots of sleeping...Sometimes got back to work on Tues, sometimes not until Wed. Each treatment for me gave me different side effects, but no nausea or vomiting.... Hope you feel better soon. Judy",

Dr. is quick to suggest IV infusion of Reclast or monthly Actonel pills. Since I have about every side effect that Femara can offer, I am of course reluctant to try these drugs and experience even more side effects. Anyone out there on these drugs ??? Judy",

I expressed my dissatisfaction of being told over the phone I had bc and then nothing. They told me there used to be a person who counseled bc patients immediately after their diagnosis, but that person was let go due to cut backs in hospital personnel. Nice !! Finally, I found help in the surgeon's nurse who called me two days later. She was wonderful and has continued to help me through this. But they don't realize that a person needs help immediately after that dreadful diagnosis. Unfortunately, I didn't find this site until my chemo was over. I would definitely talk to your oncologist or surgeon and express your feelings about these things. You might also consider talking to your PCP or consulting a psychiatrist for some medication to help you through the anxiety of this diagnosis. I did and it helped me immensely. I don't know if you have to have chemo or just a lumpectomy/radiation....but it is all do-able and Im sure you will be fine. Judy",

Because I fell into the Medicare \"donut hole\" I was forced to get my Femara from a mail order company in Missouri. Its the generic form of Femara. Since then I have been noticing even more weight gain and bouts of depression the day after I take the pill. Just wondered if anyone else noticed a difference between the generic form of medications and the \"real thing\". Thanks, Judy",

There is no easy way to tell them. You just have to have a positive outlook and reassure them that you have good doctors and you are going to beat this. However, I did not tell other members of my family until after my first chemotherapy treatment. I had chemo first, then lumpectomy and radiation will start next week. Its very hard to admit you have bc..... I too had filled out my retirement papers and was going for some annual check ups when they discovered my breast cancer. So needless to say, retirement was postponed. You must go ahead with treatment. Its not easy, but you will make it through as all of us have. And yes, you will have to delay some things, but just tell yourself its only for awhile. My \"angel\" that helped me through all of this was my surgeon's nurse. I am sure you will find that \"angel\" to get you through your treatment. I always think of Barry Manilow's song....I Made It Through The Rain....with the others who got rained on too\" Judy",
