      "Content": "Wish it was clearer for you. As for the time, Donna's oncologist told her that most trials required starting within 12 weeks, so eight weeks (while probably longer than most oncs would want) would still qualify you for a study. Are they saying 2% better chance of survival or relapse? Your going to have to go with your gut; see which doctor you trust most and go with it. Of course you could always get a fourth opinion, but your going to drive yourself nuts. Good Luck with the decision. Bob",

And it's hard to post about the latest episode of some tv show or the latest baseball game... when life is not about that right now. So I am also tired of cancer. Hugs Bob",

      "Content": "She has had a very similar course to yours; Surgery was on April 20th; BRCA neg; 1.1 cm; two nodes neg; clear margins; trip neg (although pathology from biopsy showed er +). At her follow-up appointment on Friday, her surgeon drained a little fluid from under her arm which seemed to help her pain. She also got them to let her take ibuprofen instead of Tylenol which also helped. She's also doing a lot of crying and taking xanex. Everything I've read says that the survival rate is the same for masectamy vs. lumpectamy, what is different is the recurrence rate. I think my wife made the right emotional choice for herself, even though at the time we thought she was er +; I don't think she would have opted for the masectamy if we had an initial trip negative. I think your doctors recommended the best thing to you based on your condition; try not to dwell on second guessing their medical advice (easier said then done). I also read that BRCA positive woman tend to be trip neg as well as African American woman. I think this may skew the statistics for all trip neg woman. The BRCA gene increases the risk of reuccurance, and minority woman as a group don't get the same quality of health care. Also, the statistics are for all stages; you and my wife were stage 1. Does this make sense to anyone besides me?",

They are supposed to give her little pinpoint tatoos so that know how to position her for each treatment; figure out if they can do it on her stomach rather than her back; and give a fake treatment. Things we didn't know until we met with the radiation onc. include: the whole breast gets radiated, not just the lumpectomy area (then the last five treatments are the lumpectomy area only); the radiation will fry some lung tissue and may damage the heart; there is a way they can give higher doses and fewer treatments. And I'm sure I am leaving something out of this, but I don't think they said anything about a mold.",
