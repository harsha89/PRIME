The tingleing or itching ,whichever you want to call it, is the only problem I am having. I have tried just about everything I can think of. If any of you have had this problem, how in the world do you cope? Any and all ideas will be helpful. Thanks",

      "Content": "Like all the ladies here, I started losing mine about 3 weeks after my first chemo. Didn't really notice anything till I was in the shower. Then BLAM there I was with a handful of hair. Was wondering why my head was so sore. That lasted about a week then when I saw the hair I knew why. But now that it's gone the soreness isn't there. I used to wear my hair long and had it cut short before my first chemo. Thought it wouldn't bother me too much once it started to come out. But that night I did like most ladies here. Got outta the shower, told my daughter to get the electric razor my boyfriend used to trim his beard. After she trimmed it as short as she could the razor was next. It is about 1/2\" long right now. Can't bring myself to use the razor and make it slick! But I know that's the best way to go. When it's this short it does stick on the pillow at night. Like most said here, it's up to you when you deside to join us slickheads! But believe me, your head will feel a lot better after. And get ready for the tears, they will come the first time you look in the mirror. But when that happens just keep in mind, This is the one thing I have control over! Keep us posted on how it goes. My prayers are with you. \"HUGS\"",

Lived to be 93, no gray hair till she hit about 80. But I see the double chin,,laugh lines, crows feet,ect. And don't get me started on the mirror that USED to be on the back of the bathroom door! There should be a law about where you can hang those things. Very scary to open the shower door and see that old lady looking back at you!!!",
