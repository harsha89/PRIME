      "Content": "Hi, So glad that you were finally able to get someone to listen and get your appointment moved forward. I can't believe that doctors (or whoever does the scheduling) don't realize how difficult the waiting and not knowing is. You are in our prayers. Good luck with the test and keep us updated. Love, judy",

I'm lucky in the fact that my surgeon is also the one to perform the test so I don't have to worry about meeting a new doctor this time. My colonoscopy is scheduled for Mon at 7:30 a.m. Take care. love, judy",

They also mentioned a needle aspiration but I don't know it that will be done tomorrow or if I schedule that after the exam. Given my history of 2 years ago, this is a scary time. I'm praying the area in question will turn out to be benign and I can get back on an even path again. Thanks, Judy",
