      "Content": "Annie, you are always welcome on this site. Any info you can give wil be of help to someone. I am a breast cancer survivor. I am presently undergoing reconstruction. I had a bilateral free TRAM flap reconstruction in February of this year and yesterday I had the nipple reconstructed on my left breast and the right breast was revised. I have still one more surgery to go through. I was hoping this would be the last. Any help I can give you I am more than happy to do so. Please, keep coming back to our site. It is made up of people just like you and me and her and so on and so forth. Jane",

I had thick, nicely arched black eyebrows. I never did learn how to put on false lashes. Can't have everything. Jane",

      "Content": "Remember, Nancy and anyone else about to become bald, losing your hair really is not bad at all. No more shampooing, no conditioning, no blow drying, no worrying about a \"bad hair day\". Just slap on that wig, a scarf and or a hat and you're set for the day. Personally, I enjoyed being bald. Rarely wore my wig, only when my bald head would embarrass the person I was with, namely Kathy, my oldest daughter. I found out I have a very pretty-shaped head. no dents or bulges. I wore it proudly. I wanted people to know I was in the fight for my life and wanted them to think about it and maybe do something for themselves for early detection. The only hair I really missed was my eyebrows and eyelashes. No more shaving either. That's a plus. Jane",
