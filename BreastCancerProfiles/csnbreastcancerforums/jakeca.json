      "Content": "Has anyone experienced actual soreness of the breast, reminding me of post lumpectomy soreness only not as severe? My breast is tender and hurts if I bump it or lay on it wrong. Doctor told me that the radiation was irritating nerve endings that were damaged during surgery. It's no big deal, but I have never heard anyone else mention this. I do have some sunburn-like soreness on the tender skin between my breast and my armpit. Not too bad. I use a product called \"Natural Care Gel\" that the doctor recommended for that. I just finished treatment #20 out of thirty.",

      "Content": "I have had two treatments of Cytoxan and Taxotere, my third being tomorrow. I am fortunate and will only have to have four total. I assume there are different strengths or amounts of the drugs--my infusion only takes about three and 1/2 hours. Anyway, it might encourage you to know that I have had very few side effects from either of the treatments. No nausea. The steroids make me a little \"freaky\"--rubber leggy and hard to sleep. I do feel some fatigue--more the second time than the first and I expect that will increase again this next time. Anyway, overall, I feel I have nothing to whine about. I am very fortunate compared to others and maybe that is how it will be for you, too! God is my refuge and strength.",
