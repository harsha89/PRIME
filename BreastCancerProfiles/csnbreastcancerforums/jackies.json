    "Content": "Hi Sue, it's Jackie, replying to your sore dry mouth problem--been there, done that, got it right now as a matter of fact. I have discovered that in the middle of each cycle, at the point when my white count is lowest, is when I get painful sores in my mouth. They usually last 3-5 days, then, as my counts begin to rise, the sores begin healing. My oncologist gave me some prescription mouthwash, which gives temporary relief. It's a mixture of Mylanta, Lidocaine, and liquid Benadryl. I just swish it around and spit it out. I use it every 2-3 hrs. when my mouth is really sore. They also recommend using a salt water rinse after every meal. Sometimes, when the pain is really bad, I just take a percocet (or even 1/2 of one) and rest for a while. Hope this is helpful. And remember, this too shall pass! (I'm telling myself that as much as you!) Take care and keep in touch! Jackie",
