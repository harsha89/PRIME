When I called, I called attention to the STAT check, and said \"you are already in violation. I need an approval or rejection today so that I can decide what to do. I will say that, should you reject, I will be sending an appeal to HealthNet umbrella company, and I will certainly be pointing out your delay.\" I got a call 2 hours later that it was approved. It helped that the hospital/surgeon I wanted was already contracted with HealthNet, just not my group... I do need to say that I tried to be treated completely outside my insurance by City of Hope. When I spoke with a gal there, she said that even if I was denied by my insurance, the first round of treatment is pretty much the same anywhere. She suggested that maybe I should save my fight for out-of-network for the second time around, should I need it.

      "Content": "I am thankful for being able to post this....   10 years ago, November 27, I was told I needed to \"get my affairs in order, you have 6 months to live\".  I do not follow directions very well (although I DID get my will finished, trust for my disabled daughters established, etc) and so I come to this anniversary I was not expected to live to celebrate. My life was changed forever by these 3 words \"You have cancer\".  Over the years, as I continue contact with many, many cancer warriors, I reflect on how blessed I am to have so many that I am honored to call 'friend'.   I have needed to tuck many in my heart, as with those we have see go on this year, but they are safe there, and they still make me smile as something reminds me of them...   I have once again reconfigured my life, and live in 2 countries on a permanent basis.  I now can communicate in 3 (and a half...still working on Italian) languages, and I have, as a result of my living choices, sold my business, and, after the miracle event of a new heart for my beau last July, have taken up traveling to places I have only dreamed of. I have written a book, and smile at the wonderful responses to it. I still keep you all here in my prayers every night, although many of you I have not officially 'met'. Thank you for kindly reading my post, as many of you have not known me...and I wish the wish of each of you being able to post such as I do now....10 years after the menace cancer first made itself known to me!   I wish you all the happiest of holidays....Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and all of the assorted other greetings for my beautiful diverse set of friends!   BIG hugs, Kathi  *smile*",

I should be jumping for joy. Instead, I have mixed emotions. It's the turning of another page. I hope that the suit brought an awareness to the facility and their holding company...so that this won't happen again. I am relieved that I don't have to appear in court, but then, on the other hand, I feel badly that I couldn't tell the world what it lost when she died.

      "Content": "The lymph system is actually another circulatory system in the human body. The veinous and the arterial are well known, and pretty dynamic, since they interact with the heart. Their eb and flow are controlled by, to varying degrees, the pumping action of the heart. But the lymph system is a bit different. It takes care of providing the cushioning fluid between the cells, and the nodes have the behavior of a traffic round...more of a directional system, than a suction/pressure system like the other two. For instance, when you scrape yourself without drawing blood, and a fluid appears, that's lymph at work! The lymph system eventually empties into the veins. Once this sytem is compromised, like the sentinel node removal most of we lumpectomy/mastectomy patients have likely had (ask your surgeon), the 'traffic round' is removed, and so it is even harder for the fluid to get to and from the area around the cells. These removed sentinel nodes are special in that they are the first nodes connected to the breast, so it is a great indicator of cancer spread and determines treatment options. The next set of nodes removed receive more fluid from the upper arm than the sentinels, and so, if removed, are a bit more likely to cause blockage and swelling of the arm. There are other pathways in the arm that do not use this, and will, to some extent, shoulder the burden left by removal of nodes. The idea of the 'special arm' is because it is hard to determine whose lymph system will continue to work, and whose won't, as a result of the surgery and the radiation to the area. As others have said, you need to be cautious with the arm...limit blood draws, do not have blood pressure cuff useage, etc...just to cut down on the chance of this trouble appearing. Just like people wearing seat belts in their car. BUT, that said, ask your doctor for exercises, etc that ARE ok...or ask for a referral to a special therapist to keep the arm as good as it can get. Hugs, Kathi (Thought I'd post it as a new thread...got this from both my beau, who is a doctor, and my radiation oncology nurse)",

Then, Sunday last, I received a call from my mom (I was still in Holland), to say that my younger daughter (she was in a mental health facility) died unexpectedly. We are having an autopsy done, etc, to rule out medical malpractice. So, another angel is \"walking with God\". In a way, this was a good thing, because she had been not responding well to any medication used to attempt to stablize her, and was sleeping most of the time from the side effects. She was 22 on December 12. So, I don't think I will be celebrating the holidays of late 2006/early 2007. My effective family has been cut in half. But, I am doing the steps necessary, and will keep as good an attitude as I can, realizing that all things happen according to plan. Hugs, Kathi",

      "Content": "On a lighter note...*grin*....thought I'd share my typical European (the Netherlands) weekend...you might be surprised at the differences... It starts up on Friday morning, when we go to the market in town. This is a working market...stalls for everything from fruits and vegies, cheese and meats, fish, baked goods to textiles and clothing. We do our shopping for the weekend every week on Fridays. We greet and chat with many friends who are there, as well, and may go to a small cafe nearby for a cup of coffee. The rest of Friday is spent doing chores...and organizing all of our purchases...cleaning/debonning the fish, sorting the baked goods, preparing the fruits (the pineapple right now is sooooo sweet!). Friday evening we may go visiting to friends, or have them come for a glass of wine, or dinner (sometimes one leads into the other...*grin*...the living style is very flexible here). Saturday is usually a trip to a swapmeet or antique market. While we are there, the habit is to take a break and have frietes (french fries) or maybe a broodje croquette...maybe a cup of hot chocolate. This can take anywhere from 2 to 8 hours of our day. We then return home for dinner, either home or out with friends. Sunday is the different day. There are very few grocery stores open (if any), and no other types of stores, unless it is a special 'shopping Sunday'. 20 years ago, when I first started visiting, there was nothing open to buy things except the shops in the gas stations (think AM/PM market). This requires planning on Friday and Saturday to make sure that everything is bought for things to do on Sunday. Or, the restaurants are open...and, the biggest thing, other than the churches, that are open are the museums. We have a card that gives us free admission to most Dutch museums. My favorite, the music box museum, is a short train ride away, and they give docent-led tours that allow us to hear the actually boxes being played.  With all of this, we don't use our car very much. To the swapmeets usually, if they are far. Or to drive to the train station when the weather is bad. But, mainly, our normal mode of transportation is by bike. So is it for our friends. This only gets tricky when too much wine is consumed, and then the ride home in the dark can be a challenge (I have fallen more often than I like to think...*grin*...luckily the wine keeps me from too serious a fall). As I travel to other countries, I enjoy seeing the similarities and the differences in lifestyle. Spain, for instance, usually doesn't start dinner until 10pm. Greece, you can spend 3-4 hours at the table....eating things (as we did on Crete) as they became ready out of the kitchen, enjoying the company and the friendliness of the patrons around us. France...many places are closed between 1pm and 2pm for 'rest'. My beau and I seek out the non-tourist places to go...and will only think about the 'tourist menu' in a place where we can't read the language. But, even then, the small restaurant owners are usually so proud, they will 'speak' with us thru pictures and hand signals. Most countries the water served is ok, but we always bring Immodium just in case, and there are some of the poorer countries where we just order a liter bottle of 'still' water (without bubbles). So, that is a bit of my experience...I have learned to embrace the differences, but at first, I will say, I used to become overloaded and look for something familiar. In China, for instance, I ordered just white rice for dinner one evening...*grin*. My beau and I have learned that included in every trip is as least one 'rest' day...where we don't do anything too much, recharge and ready for the next day's adventure. We have met so many, many wonderful people on our travels, both the residents and fellow travelers. Sure, we have encountered some nasty people (EasyJet in Italy), but it, too, is just part of the experience. I wouldn't change my life for the world!!!! Hugs, Kathi",

My treatment center had a special program, led by the physiotherapist at the hospital, to teach us how to protect the 'special' arm, while resuming activities. But, as far as attitude...I agree!!! We can choose to stay sad, which isn't much fun, or embrace living as a result of being reminded by cancer that our lives can be cut short...I chose living life! Sure, I have my moments. I was sooooo glad, for instance, that I hurt my other arm...it swelled in the fingers because a brace was too tight...can you imagine if that was my 'special' arm? Thanks for your thoughts on this, I'm glad you are getting on with life!!! BIG hugs, Kathi And, hey, if you move to Germany, we'll be neighbors!!!! It's just a short train ride (or a medium car ride) from The Netherlands! I recommend Rosetta Stone software to learn German, if you need it. I used it, and my Dutch improved ALOT!",

Could be that you have just enough ovary function that it causes 'break thru' state of peri-menopausal, but not consistent enough to catch consistent hormone levels. Make sure your gyn knows.... Also, you MAY want to discuss changing to Tamoxifen, if truly things are returning...this is the only truly effective treatment to reduce breast cancer reoccurance in menstruating women... Congrats!

And now that my beau has a new heart, his immune system will be compromised for the rest of his life from the anti-rejection drugs...   The tips I share are: Take antibacterial wipes with you.  As you sit down, wipe down EVERYTHING...tray table, video remote, arm rests. If you are checking in with your smart phone....do not give it to the gate person to scan.  Better yet, for this time, print a paper boarding pass before you go....or if you are traveling with someone, hand them the paper boarding pass to hand to the gate person.  If you forget to print it, and need to hand your phone to the gate person, just make sure to wipe it down (the phone, not the gate person *grin*) right away.  Even with a totally healthy immune system, I caught a nasty cold/flu just this way once by surrendering my phone.  And my daughter did, as well.... If you need to use the toilet, wipe your hands on returning to your seat with an antibacterial wipe. Take a mask.  Or two.  If your seat next is occupied with a sneezer/sniffler/cougher, put it ON! If that same sneezer finds the need to share by sneezing in your food, buzz the flight attendant, explain the situation of active treatment, and request another meal.  I did this once.  I guess it wasn't enough indication to my seat mate that I was bald.  Sigh....she sneezed not once, but 3 times directly into my food.  In defense, I turned on the air and pointed it so it would blow directly between us (not on either).  She got the hint... Ask to pre-board so that you have the least amount of time in a crowd.  Share this early with the airline person at the gate, explaining that you are in active cancer treatment.  Speak up!  It's your health you risk! Resist the impulse to touch your eyes/nose with your hands....for the entire trip, not just the flying part! Wash your hands often. Make sure to do the in-flight stretching that they show.  Also, if possible, get up and walk around.  This will keep the blood flowing everywhere.   Hugs, Kathi",

I have learned, in all of my years, that there is a tendency in research to stress the findings that support whatever way the researcher wants to see it...in other words, take the same idea, and it can be used to argue on either side. My questions from the article would be...who was in the sample groups? Were the ages, ethnicity, prior survivorship, prior hysterectomy (hormone changes), matched in each group? Cancer is a sneaky devil...there may (hopefully!) come a time in the future that people look back and say how 'barbaric' our treatment methods are...but, IMHO, this is the best we have now, and if we don't fight hard, there will be no one in the future... \"They did not find that hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen) caused cognitive difficulties.\"...from the article....I can find another, quite easily, that says the opposite... Thank you for the link...all information is good...even if only to make us think...but to try to make our own treatment choices, unless we are as well informed as the treating professionals, can have significant impact on our longevity.

OK, so, here is a not-so-nice story: 2 weeks before our flight, I COMPLETELY pulled out my back...so bad that I told my beau that he needed to call the paramedics so that I could move...and MAN! Did I have to PEE!!! He silently handed me a Vicodin. Within 30 minutes, I had my normal reaction to the big \"V\"...hot flash of MAJOR size!! But at least I could struggle to the toilet. For 2 weeks, I really suffered, and we were not sure if I could go. I'm talking using a cane, and pulling myself up off the toilet... and you know what that means to a colorectal cancer survivor such as myself!!!! But, inspired by my fav chenheart, I sucked it up and said \"Hey, this is NOT going to ruin MY life!!!!\" I got on that plane, and did my exercising, but almost had to crawl off...my back seized!!! Pain killers and muscle relaxants got me on the plane to Barcelona, but it wasn't fun, either!!! Finally, 3 days into the cruise, I felt human again...but still took my Naproxin every 6 hours!!!

And I was told I was an inspiration (something that sort of rubs to this day....I didn't choose this to happen, any more than the death of my daughter...). ANYWAY.....my answer to 'Why?' was and is: Because. That's it. And whatever floats your boat as to how to handle it when it happens. As you may recall, I had a scare not too long ago that breast cancer had returned. In the other breast. My reaction? \"I will NOT take the chemo I had last time AGAIN!!! Even if it means my life\". I was later lucky twice...first, according to my onc, I can only have the 'red devil' Adriamycin once....too much risk for heart damage (which I did end up with);and second, the lump doesn't look like a threat at this point. I must agree, Jan, I have no answer to why, after fighting the good fight, with the strong attitude, sometimes it isn't enough. Again, because is the only answer I can offer.... Sadder yet, are all of these people that feel that other people's lives are not worth anything, and kill in cold blood. I am not afraid of death. I have faced it twice. My time now is a gift...I open everyday. I cannot answer the question...\"What do I have to live for?\" any other way than \"Do you feel your life has accomplished everything you want it to?\".

Day 2, morning I felt great, again...worked till about 1 p.m. Then got tired, went home. Day 3, I felt pretty rocky all day. Slept ALOT. Ate scalloped potatoes (STILL love them, to this day...lol!). Day 4, woke early, baked some crescent rolls. Ate 4 or so. Felt MUCH better. Ate special fried rice from a local place for lunch...after that, back to normal... Day 5, back to work. Normal except I craved protein, so I always treated myself to a BIG turkey sandwich for lunch. I think that knowing that it was almost over helped ALOT on day 3...the routine of it was, in a way, comforting. I'm rooting for you, sweet soul! Hugs, Kathi",

The big thing is to watch for ANY infection...THAT would DEMAND a call, day or night, to your doc.... I also used to take camomile baths (turn on the tub tap, hang a few camomile tea bags under the water, fill the tub, soak) for sunburn, maybe that would help..Again, call your doc...if he/she says \"It won't hurt\", then try it...that is always MY philosophy...
