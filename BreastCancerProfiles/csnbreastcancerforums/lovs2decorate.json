      "Content": "Hi Stephanie! My tumor was estrogen/progesteron 92% & 94% and was told I would do very well with the Tamoxifen as well. I discussed my concerns as far as being able to tolerate taking it with my oncologists. He has me taking 10mg every other day for a month (started 7/4). Then in Aug., I will go to 10mg everyday. In Sept., I will go up to 20mg daily. He is having me come in to talk to him mid September to moniter how I'm doing. Maybe you can discuss easing you on it as well if there are concerns of how your body will handle the medication? Justine I got myself this bc wine glass that was hand painted, I use it every morning with my meds . I figure I may as well take it with style!",

      "Content": "Hi Jo Jo, Did your Dr. give you anti nausa medication? My surgen gives me prescrption strenght dramimine and then the travel sickness patch behind the ear so I don't get sick after my surgery. The side effect is it dialates my eyes. I can't focus for about 6 days afterwards.(Of course he doesn't tell me BEFORE that this will happen!) I have had one surgery after my bi-laterial and the same thing happened. I'm going back in on Thursday for more surgery and already know it's going to happen again. Hope it passes soon! Maybe catch up on some videos? Justine :)",

      "Content": "I purchased mine from a site called creativemedicalid.com. I had it done in surgical stainless steel, it is link braclet with a heart charm on it and on the back of the heart is \"LIMB\" & \"TRAM FLAP\". My dr. advised me to have that put on, like you said, in case of an accident and you are unresponsive. I also carry a medical alert card in my wallet. The braclet wasn't cheep but I figured if I was going to wear it forever, I may as well get one I liked. Hope the site gives you some choices you like! Hugs, Justine",
