If mom lived longer than that, we needed some documentation from a doctor that they (Hospice) were still needed. When Hospice first came out, they needed documentation of what was going on with mom, in essence, why they were needed. They were kind, compassionate, and walked with us every step of the way. They're there to help YOU, the caregiver as well as your mother. Bless you, dh",

They say with some breast cancers that the long-term rates of recurrence are the same with lumpectomy/rads vs. masectomy. Most of that research, however, is done on post-menopausal women. BC that occurs in pre-menopausal women is often a different beast. I'm sorry that you're second guessing ... I just read today that breast cancer sufferers rank among the highest of all cancer survivors that deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. We do what we have to when we're diagnosed, we make the best decisions we can and then the emotional fall-out occurs months after we're 'done.' The decision was made. Second guessing is just going to literally drive you insane. I too think the support group will be a good idea. Hang in there!",

And if her diagnosis had happened now they would have told me to start getting them earlier. I had to pay for them myself - insurance wouldn't pay. This year, at 39, I felt something in my right breast. Mammo. showed nothing, ultra-sound showed nothing. But there were calicfications in my left breast. Couldn't feel it, gyno. couldn't feel it. It was DCIS. I'd say to your younger family members ... get them!!!!! Get the gene test, if it is positive, insurance may cover it. But get them! I've heard too what Mimi has said. It tends to be more aggressive in younger women, the earlier you find it, the better.",

This year, things were really tight and I simply didn't have the money, but felt something and totally went to my ob-gyn anyway and just thought I would charge it. They hooked me up with a program in my state that pays for mammos for women who don't have insurance. So ... there are programs out there if you need financial help.",

He said that becaues my skin is so thin that there is a possibility that one or both would have issues with healing; there isn't a good blood supply and heaing is compromised. He's seen it in other women who have thin skin. And when he said this, I thought of you and the problem with healing you're having. Do you have thin skin on top? Even though I had a skin-saving masectomy, I've had that issue. They couldn't expand me anymore because of it. He said that the skin where they do the nipple might turn black and sluff off ... that the nipple won't be as pronounced, but there would still be something there. Hmmmm ... not sure I want to go there. How are you doing/healing? Hope things are looking better for lefty and that mid-terms are coming up for righty! :) Blessings, dh",

I don't want to drink 7-up all the time because of the extra calories ... I have yet to try water with simple lime or lemon in it ... that may make it better. I think the Crystal Light would be fine ... anything, something to keep you hydrated. I don't know what's up with the taste either. I haven't had so much a taste problem, it just that nothing sounds good to me, except friend foods. I don't know what the deal is with the fried foods. Always during PMS I would crave such things, but now I'm craving that kind of stuff all the time. I've always been a disciplined eater, and this is all new to me. Hopefully, Pammy, this will get better with time. You just started the Tamoxifen again ... and maybe ... hopefully it will subside with time! Let's hope so! Love, April",

My B.S. did a skin-sparing MX and it helped achieve better results (I am thin and he did not have a lot of skin to work with). All of this to say ... seek other opinions if you need/want to and work with a P.S. that your B.S. recommends, if possible.",

From what I've read the one-step procedure is difficult to attain good results. I would listen to your PS. The one-step gets the best results with women who were small breasted to begin with. I had immediate reconstruction with TE placement and was stretched over a period of five months. I exchanged to 325 cc silicone implants and wear a 30D bra. They are wider and not as much projection as my natural breasts but I'm very happy with my results. They are not my natural breasts ... but I am happy. IMO, listen to your PS.",
