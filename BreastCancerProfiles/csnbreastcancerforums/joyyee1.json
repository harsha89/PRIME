      "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy almost a year ago and then chemotherapy which ended in August 2010. I'm currently continuing with Herceptin treatments until April 2011 every 3 weeks. My oncologist had me scheduled for a Bone Scan but then changed it to a Bone Density test. These are very different tests.... has anyone had a bone scan after breast cancer?? Should I ask to have one?? Or is the bone density enough??",
