    "Content": "I have had several rounds of Faslodex, first alone and now with Ibrance added.   I had very few side effects with Faslodex alone.  The shots aren't that bad but I did have some fatigue.   THe Ibrance has caused bad fatigue and now mouth sores that are keeping me awake.   I will get some magic mouthwash on Monday when they are back in the office.  ",
