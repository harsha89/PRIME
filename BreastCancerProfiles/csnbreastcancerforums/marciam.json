    "Content": "Hi all, I also had swelling when my drains were removed. My Dr. had to aspirate fluid at least 4 times. I don't think icing will help. Try keeping a thin pillow between affected side and arm. I received one from American. Cancer society. Also a sports bra helps especially at night. I could not wear any other kind of bra. My Physical therapist made me an insert to put pressure on the swollen area. It helped in between drainings. My chest was swollen all through chemo amnd radiation. It is getting more flat now which is almost a year since my surgery. good luck. I hope this helps you. Blessings, Marciam",
