      "Content": "I am scheduled to get a TRAM later this month so have just gone through some of this decision process. Have you seen a plastic surgeon yet? That may help with your decision. Make sure you are comfortable with the surgeon. The first one I saw left my husband and me with the feeling that there was no good reconstruction option for me. My radiation oncologist encouraged me to get a second opinion. We're glad we did, the surgeon I'm working with now took the time to explain the different procedures and why I was not a good candidate for some. Bottom line. Due to what the radiation did to my skin, he did not recommend an implant. Said there could be a risk of extrusion (the implant popping out through the skin). He walked us through the types of flaps available and why a TRAM would be his recommendation. See what type of pre screening the surgeon may want you to have. Mine wanted me to have a cardiac consult due to the chemo and a PET scan. The scan led to a breast MRI that identified multiple microcalcifications in the remaining breast. They can't say the calcifications are benign and there are so many that even if they biopsy a few and they are negative can't guarantee all are negative. So I'm now considering having a simple mastectomy done at the same time of reconstruction (if it's possible - still working that). Just found out about the MRI results 3 days. Why am I'm telling you all this? Make sure you are comfortable with the plastic surgeon. If he isn't willing to take time during an office visit how do you know he'll take the time in the surgical suite needed to give optimal results. If he doesn't offer, ask if he has before and after pictures of previous patients. Our second surgeon took over an hour talking with us volunteered to show us pictures. This is a big decision, make sure all your questions are answered. It is your body, do what is right for you. Hope this gave you some food for thought.",
