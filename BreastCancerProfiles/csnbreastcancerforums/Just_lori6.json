    "Content": "Hi Puffin, I've been thinking of you just about every day. I went in for my last chemo treatment on Monday & thought of how happy I was to be done & then I put myself in your shoes and thought if if meant not losing any loved ones in the future I would gladly keep doing chemo for a bit longer. It is scary not knowing what the future holds. Im so happy to hear you have so many kind people in your life. I know it is so very hard for you and I am amazed at how well you are doing. What great friends to help with the thank you cards & take you birding. I know it is easier said than done but if I've learned anything with this cancer stuff we just have to get through each day as best as we can & wait for it to be better. Just take it one day at a time~ I wish we all lived in the same area. We could all help you with the cards and just be with you through tough times or ugly crys.  Take care Puffin & know that you will be okay~ ♡ Hugs~ Lori    ",
