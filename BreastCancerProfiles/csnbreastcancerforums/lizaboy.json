      "Content": "Hi girls I saw my plastic surgeon today and discussed nipple reconstruction and reduction of his magnificent handy work. Nipple first-as my natural nipple is rather small, flat and altogether insignificant[poor wee thing] he has suggested tattoo only. As he said if I don't like it I can always get more done. As for my outsized right boob, he has suggested liposuction which does not sound too awful,lets face it there is not a lot of feeling there anyway. I have to go back in three months and let him know what I have decided. I'll probably go with his suggestions but I thought I'd ask all you ladies who have been here ahead of me what you think Thanks all love Liza",
