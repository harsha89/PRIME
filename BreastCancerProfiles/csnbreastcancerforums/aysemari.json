I HAD to get back to my size and be able to fit in my clothes again. But I would get so frustrated each time, when nothing fit and I looked awful in my old clothes.

Please be prepared for chemo, I don't know if you have someone to take care of you but if not then get your home ready. Prepare meals and put them in easy to open containers. Put some dishes on the counter to use, you will have difficulty reaching. Put out some clothes that open in the front out. I think that is enough for now.... I don't want to bore you -) Hugs, Ayse",

Arm yourself with as much information as you can, I found it is easier if you take an active role in your treatment. You will be surprised to see just how many women are battling alongside of you.

I had to do it with one of my rescue cats, he had a nasty disease called stomatitis, basically your gums are allergic to your teeth, he could not eat poor thing would just cry. I had all his teeth pulled, it did not help. And he was suffering, it was one of the hardest things I have done but I knew it was time and I had to do it. 9 years is a long time for that furry little stinker to grow on you, so I can only imagine how hard it must be for you. My friend's cat had cancer and it didn't want to eat my friend made her it and she did. Later the vet found cancer in her mouth as well. And he said that the cat must be in great pain and it is still eating nevertheless to please my friend.. that's how animals are selfless. I know you'll do the right thing. Love, Ayse",

This is a place bustling with smart and caring women, ready to help anyway they can. I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. My doctor put the expanders in and every week I got expanded. This was a painful process to me and I would recommend you take the valium they give you, helps with the muscle spasms. Then they put the real implants in. That was not a hard surgery for me. And now, not to ruin it for you, while I have amazing looking breasts, every doctor compliments me on them, I do find them uncomfortable and sometimes play with the thought of having them removed. But for now I saw enough doctors to last me for a life time and I am leaving it alone (: Good luck with your surgery and I hope you will have a very quick recovery. Hugs, Ayse",

Put aside your emotions, as hard as it will be with all you are going through, but the last thing you want to do is make this any harder on yourself. Look at your treatment time as a time to reflect and in your case to react. Make smart moves and eliminate anything stressful, be blissfully ignorant and turn the other blind eye. Go ahead and make a blue print, a blue print of your brand new life and let that be your focus. That and your health.

      "Content": "I went through chemo kicking and scream (even if it was just in my imagination). Prior to cancer I never took any medication at all, strong believer in rest, nutrition and physical fitness. So it was VERY hard for me to have them pump all these chemicals in my body. But as others posted before, I was clueless on what to do. But I knew one thing, my cancer was very aggressive and the tumor grew so fast, I did not have time to experiment. Am I experimenting now? You bet I am. I didn't during chemo, did not want to interfere with it. But now I do everything I personally think would be beneficial to me. I am a big advocate for juicing and I read and learn a lot about natural ways to heal my battered body. And some times I feel like I stepped on some toes when I posted on here. But I don't want to tell anyone how to go about their healing, I am just suggesting and sharing. Our bodies went through so much that I think we need to take EXTREMELY good care of them. I get that a lot, sometimes I felt like I asked too many questions but then again this is MY life and I have a right to get as much information as I can. I feel like my oncologist is not taking my side effects seriously. And I HATE, hate hate not getting an answer... as to why I feel so exhausted. It scares me... since the year leading up to my diagnosis, I went through similar things and at time also no one knew what was wrong with me. But I am still getting my ohm on when I can and I keep walking as much as I can. There's gotta be light at the end of the tunnel.. I just know it. Sorry for rambling on. I don't handle not being able to be active very well. Hugs, Ayse",
