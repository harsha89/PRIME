      "Content": "Hi Dawne, I know everyone is different, but if it helps any here are my \"two cents\"! I am a natural born redhead, with pale slightly freckly skin. I figured that I would be toast! I had 35 treatments including four \"boost\" treatments. My skin got real pink and sort of dry (like a regular sunburn). But no blisters, no open skin, and the pinkness went away after I stopped (about two weeks later). I used aquaphor, too. Best of luck! Hope you breeze on through it all! REST! Sybil",

      "Content": "Hi, so sorry that happened to you. I had an anaphylactic reaction to taxotere on my second treatment (of four). Throat closed up, could not breathe, rash, back and side pain. I got similar treatment, IV benadryl, IV solumedrol, etc. Then after some plain IV fluids, they restarted at a super slow rate. I had to take my other two treatments at a slower rate, but was able to tolerate the last two. That was so scary! Best wishes to you on your continued treatments... Sybil",

The side effects are not the easiest--bone pain, fatigue, sometimes insomnia, hot flashes, but I have made it through so far. I have thought of stopping the drug early on, but I am sort of adjusting... Best wishes as you make your decision, Sybil",

Although, I still wondered if I would be one (a survivor)...that was a year and a half ago...so far so good... Sybil",
