      "Content": "Amen and hallelujah to that! I also underwent a double mastectomy in Dec, finished chemo the end of May and going in tomorrow morning to have tissue expanders replaced with implants. For the last month I have felt so wonderful!!! Although I had a scare with my scans ( read the message I posted earlier about Miracle) now I feel like conquering the world! And somehow those little things like \"housework\" just aren't that important anymore...funny how that works, huh???? I'm so happy for you! I hope you NEVER settle down and stop playing! LIVE IT UP!!!!!!!!1 God's grace and love to you! Mel in Arkansas",

May 24th will be my last, then about 6 weeks will be finishing up my reconstruction of both breasts (yeah! I finally get my implants!). Anyway, glad you are able to get back to work and back to LIFE again. God bless you. You will be in my prayers. Mel in Arkansas",

      "Content": "Hi, all. Mel here. Just wanted to check in & say hello! Thank you for your thoughts on my emloyer problems. Margaret, I will try to get in touch with the \"I Can Cope\" folks. Thank you for the number. I am feeling much better today ( 2 weeks since my 2nd treatment). My hair is gone, my wigs ITCH, so I am experimenting with scarves & loving it! I have a creative flair ( artist) so I am having a little fun with this little \"pointy\" bald head of mine! As far as the boss, I am trying a new outlook. My minister gave a sermon on Sun. regarding \"love thine enemies\". You know, it is really very simple to love people who return that love. The tough part is loving those who do not love us ( and irritate the heck out of us!). So, Monday I decided that every time the thought (pardon the french) \"Screw you!\" comes to mind, I will replace that with \"Bless You\". I have found it very difficult to hold anger in my heart while saying the word \"Bless\". It has truly helped me. I am going to do my best to control my \"reactions\" to his actions and if he crosses the line I know that I will have to respond to protect myself. I love the company I work for & everyone else. It's just him. Well, must go & prepare for the blessings of the day! Take care everyone. All of you are in my prayers. Love , Mel in Arkansas",

      "Content": "Hi, Gayle! So happy to hear you are doing well! I will be joining everyone in prayer that your path report is good. I had a bilateral in December with reconstruction beginning immediately. They inserted tissue expanders and I had 2 drains on each side. I hated those things!!! After one week, he removed one from either side, then waited a week and removed the last 2. The removal was nothing, really. He talked my way through it and did it so fast I didn't have time to react! Mostly I felt great relief. Like someone else said, it was the best I had felt since surgery! The fact that you have not needed strong pain medication is a very good sign...YOU ARE STRONG! Keep us posted on your progress and I will keep you in my prayers. Love, Mel in Ark.",

      "Content": "Had nipple recon surgery this past Tuesday. They took the skin from my abdomen and right now feeling pretty good. Just extremely sore. Will see the Doc on Monday to reveal my new nipples. Right now they have put some very odd looking bandages on the \"nipple\" area and am feeling some sharp pains in my breasts. If anyone out there has had this surgery, I would appreciate any information you can give me on your recovery...pain, length of recovery and so on. You know how it is...you ask the docs and nurses and they give you pretty standard answers. I would like to hear it from someone who has been there! My thoughts and prayers are with you all...
