    "Content": "Ok, here is my story. I was diaginosed with Breast Cancer in September of 2002. I had 5 surgeries, chemo and am now on meds. for 5 years. My husband was very supportive through the whole thing. He was fantastic. The Christmas of my treatment my best friends gave me a trip to Disneyworld. We went and had a great time. Now I want to go back. I discussed this with my husband and he told me he was tired and wanted to stay home his two weeks vacation and do nothing. I told him fine, I would stay home with him those two weeks but I was going to disney with our daughter the week he went back to work. He is upset with me because he says we always did things together and I have changed. I have changed. This experience has changed me and I feel that I should do this because I want to and I need to think about me to. I offered to go somewhere with him, anywhere he wanted and he is concerned about my son getting a job and my daughter going to college. These things concern me too but I told him we have to think of us too. He can not understand this. I thought since all of you have been through breast cancer, maybe you can give me your thoughts on this. I am going to Florida with my daughter but I want to know if I am being selfish. I do not think I am. Thanks in advance. Ida",
