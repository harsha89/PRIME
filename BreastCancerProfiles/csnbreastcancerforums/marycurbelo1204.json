      "Content": "live in Florida.  Florida does not require  employers provide employees with Insurance. Hence no insurance.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can see a doctor without insurance.  SUSAN KOMEN... no good, I really don't know what they do there but they never, not once helped me in any way shape or form.  I was unemployed at that time so I had a mamogram which I paid cash, very expensive,  2 days later, the results.  That set me back, emotionally, lots.  I couldn't function.  Luckily, my 3 wonderful, sent from heaven daughters were able to do everything.  I was in a trance and they thought I wouldn't come out of it.  MAJOR DEPRESSION!!! They sent me to the surgeon and then Onco....  While I was doing that, my daughters were looking for help... MORE WAIT... I found the lump in August and October 25th had a bilateral mastectomy (finally found a grant from the American Cancer Society which paid Osceola Regional... That was awesome).  Then more wait to see oncologist.  Waited 3 more months until I received best news ever.  I was approved for SSA and medicaid which paid for everything.  Later I found out I am fully vested in my Pension.  I could have started getting paid pension around 10 years ago.  All in all, waited a long time.. About 6 months went by from when my saint of a dog , American bulldog monster, was the reason I found the lump (he was my lifesaver, bless him) until I started chemo.  I believe that the average person waits because a, denial and b, terror.",
