      "Content": "So glad it is going pretty well so far for you. I will be DONE with my 33 rads tomorrow!!! Yay! Very little burning through all of this. The Aveeno and cortisone cream helped. The area that I am getting the boosters (right where my lumpectomy was done) hasn't burned at all. It's barely even pink. The time does go by so quickly and you, too, will be done before you know it.

I also use Aveeno Body Wash and Daily Lotion which has kept my skin healthy. You'll do fine. You've been through the worst (chemo) and this is a piece of cake! Bonnie",

I have my RO follow up on September 12th and she will then give me my order for the first mammogram. Scary stuff. Saw my GYN yesterday since all hell broke loose last summer and she was amazed at how well I was doing and loved the new hair style. However, she did say that next year we should talk about removing my ovaries to hopefully prevent ovarian cancer if there is ever a recurrance. More surgery? Ugh... Bonnie",

      "Content": "We've all been down similar roads. I am HER2+ also. I was told I was having 6 rounds of TCH, three weeks apart. Ended up only doing 4 because of elevated liver enzymes. Had a lumpectomy with 11 nodes removed. Then went back for 6 weekly Taxol treaments with Hercepting every three weeks. Only had 5 because of the liver again. Then 33 rad sessions. You can do this. Just like others have said, you will find your good/bad days. Don't be a hero though. I had a hard time allowing others to take care of me, but you must. And take the anti-nausea drugs. They are you friends!!! I also kept hand santitizer everywhere and my family was great about using it. No one got sick. We are here for you so vent all of your concerns and fears. Bonnie",

      "Content": "So, at one week post-chemo, I was admitted to the hospital with a high fever and an apparent staph infection which caused an abscess to form at the site under my arm where 11 lymph nodes were removed. I had the minor procedure done, it drained, closed, and I am still on preventive antibiotics. Well, now (3 weeks later) the lump under my arm is back again. I have an appointment with my surgeon for Monday morning (4 days from now) to check it out, but today my oncologist was concerned. I am also supposed to start radiation in 2 weeks, which could now be delayed again. Has anyone else had anything similar occur? Frustrated and scared in Northern Virginia Bonnie",

      "Content": "I had my port put in last September and at the same time had the sentinal node removed. I had chemo and then my lumpectomy in January, which also included the removal of 11 more nodes. The margins were clean and the 11 nodes were also clean. Then I had 33 rad treatments. Having clean margins does not pre-empt you from having radiation, but as others before me have said, to each his own decision. My decision was based on my 16 year marriage and my 12 year old son. Did I want to do whatever I had to to be here with them? you bet. Was it hell to go through for the last year? You bet. Would I do it all again if I had to? Without a doubt. Good luck with your decisions and lumpectomy. We are here for you and will listen. The decisions are yours to make. BTW, rads were the easiest part of this entire ordeal. Bonnie",
