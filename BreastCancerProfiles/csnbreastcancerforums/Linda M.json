    "Content": "ditto on the caliber of this dude. An attorney is what you need, and then if nothing else you can tell your ex and his sleazeball lawyer not to make any more direct contact with you, just with your lawyer. That will be worth the price right there! the claims are ridiculous and designed to intimidate you before you even get into the fight. Don't beleive any of it. Also, I have been living with metastatic disease for 7 years now, and I'm doing fine. Any knowledgeable oncologist will tell you that the disease is not curable but it can be managed for years with various medications, like any chronic condition. You have my good wishes for strength to get through this. --Linda",
