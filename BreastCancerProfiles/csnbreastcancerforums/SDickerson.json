      "Content": "I was dx with stage 2 triple negative bc April 20th of this year, my 47 birthday. The tumor was so big they started chemo to shrink it, AC. After one tx my onc thought that the tumor had grown and they switch to carboplitin. It shrunk the tumor, but my blood count went to 0 and I had to be hospilitized. Something they gave me at the hospital damaged my kidney. Long story, my onc wanted me to go to surgery and have the turmo removed. I had surgery on 6/11, got clear margins, then went to radiation for 30 tx and now I am doing chemo, they have me participating in a PARP inhibitor study, which is cistplantin and PARP, a new medication for triple negative women. I love this discussion board because sooo many women are triple neg and are here to tell it and encourage us. I like my onc, but he talks to me like these are my last days. Even though, I do have good chances of NED. I don't no anything about Avastin, but I hope they keep it around. God Bless!!!!!",
