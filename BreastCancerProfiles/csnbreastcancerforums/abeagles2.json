    "Content": "I am 34 years old and recently diagnosed with BC. I have had surgery and, luckily, will not have to do chemotherapy. I do, however, have to do hormone therapy (Tamoxifen) for 5 years. I will also begin radiation next week. My onco tells me that I should not get pregnant while on this medication. This brings up several issues for me since I have no children at this time. But, the more pressing issue at this moment is that he can offer no good form of birth control while I am in treatment. I tried an IUD, but since I have not had children my cervix would not open enough to insert it. The gyno says he can surgically insert it. OUCH! The onco said there were injections I could get that would put me into menopause while taking them. But there's no guarantee it will come back and I will have to deal with the symptoms while taking the injections. Has anyone else had this problem? What should I do? Condoms are only about 70% effective. Adding spermicide only gives you about another 15%. That's not a real high number. This whole thing has been very overwhelming.",
