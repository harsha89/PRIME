    "Content": "Congrats! I agree, the port removal means the end of your treatment--back to your real life. I had my taken out one week after my last chemo treatment. I did experience a stinging or pulling at the incision location for several months after the removal. (By the way, it was on my chest just below my collarbone) It's fine now, 4 months later. The scar isn't beautiful, but I can't wear low cut tops any longer anyway so who cares? Good luck Friday! Gardengal",
