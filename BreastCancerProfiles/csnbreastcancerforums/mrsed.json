    "Content": "Hello everyone. I am new to the board and haven't even done my profile information yet. I was daignosed 3 weeks ago with invasive ductal carcinoma left breast. The first surgeon I saw wanted to do lumpectomy with radiation. The second opinion Doctor, ( who I am staying with)laid out options of mastectomy, mastectomy with implant, also mentioned Brachytherapy. I live and hour from any hospitals so 7 weeks of radiaiotn sounds exhausting to me. I saw a plastic surgery who would do implant or implants. I see a radiation oncologist on Wednesday, then back to surgeon on Friday to make my final decision. Right now I don't have a clue what to do. I've had fibromyalgia badly for 20 years. Because of the pain in my neck and shoulders I haven't benn able to wear a bra for some time. Just a soft tank top with some foam cups stuck in to give a little shape, but no lift. I am not large busted but being 61 and nursed some babies, I am sagging. I am seriously thinking about the implants because I then wouldn't have to worry about lifting my breats,(breast). In some ways it would be a blessing in disquise. BUT I am afraid the implant surgery would cause additional pain and just not sure what to do at this point. I also fear the radiation would cause even more fatigue than I already have, which is a lot. Sorry to rant on. if anyone has any experience with fibromyalgia or knows someon who does I would really appreciatie your input. Thanks so much. Mrsed",
