I'm not quite sure about the \"inner peace and calm\" since I'll probably have a tummy ache combined with a hangover. Everyone have a good weekend. Lola",

I would think it's too soon for the nose hairs to go. Maybe I should check in the mirror. Now picture that - a magnifying mirror and me trying to find nose hairs. Lola",

      "Content": "I have a question for the group. I've noticed that there are a number of women on this site who are under 40. Did you find the lump on your own or were you already getting mammos? I have been getting them since I was 25 (60 now). I started with the baseline several years after my mother was dx with BC and we knew her mom had had it too. Hey, I won the BC lottery for risk factor. Since my diagnosis, my daughter-in-law (who just turned 30) asked me when she should start getting annuals. No history in her family. After noticing how many younger women were diagnosed, thought maybe it wouldn't hurt. But she has found out that her PCP doesn't refer women under 40. Oner of her friends, with the same doctor, tried last year. This worries me. It's such a treatable disease if caught early. I actually told her if she really wants to get one as a baseline now, to tell her PCP that she felt something. What are the thoughts of the BC sisterhood on this topic? Are the doctors missing something? After my dx she is wanting to be on top of this. Thanks for the help. Lola",

I really don't want to be on alot of other meds to control the s/e. Lori, how did the Neulasta shot go. I get mine tomorrow morning since the clinic isn't open on Sat. If I tell them early enough next time they will arrange for one of the ER nurses to give it to me but I'm not sure how much more that will add to the \"bottom line\" bill. I'm feeling pretty good for 2nd day post chemo. I'm going to be at my daughter's a bit longer than I thought, my granddaughter is coming down with something so I can't go back there yet. Lola",

When I send for a student, the teachers have agreed to do a quick check to make sure they aren't actively coughing, runny nose etc. and won't send down any that seem questionable. I'll catch up with them later. I've only told a few parents right now. My case load is fairly small right now - 9 (It's been as high as 24 so I'm so thankful) Got my fingers crossed too. I'm already bored being at home and my supervisor just called to check in with me. Told her if I'm still feeling this good tomorrow, I'm coming in. Sounds like you have a supportive staff as well. Take care, Lola",

I did not intend that we show as east/west of the Mississippi but my scanner didn't want to cooperate. Now I'm struggling with uploading the 2 photos. I've tried to place them on my \"About Me\" page but the system isn't letting me \"browse\" to find them on my computer. I think I'm doing it right. Does anyone have any other suggestions as to where it could be placed for everyone to see once I solve the problem of the \"browse\" to find them? Is this just another of the glitches from this past week? Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Have a great weekend. I've got you all in my thoughts and prayers. Lola",
