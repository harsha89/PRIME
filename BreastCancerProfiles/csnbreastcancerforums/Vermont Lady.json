    "Content": " I finished 33 rad treatments in August of this year.  I used Aquaphor everyday after EVERY treatment.  I would just cover my breast (as greasy as it is) and then cover up with a sport bra.  I thought I had almost made it through untouched, until my last week of treatment.  That's when I noticed the burning starting to take place.  I continued to use the Aquaphor for almost a month after treatment was done.  My skin did peel (much like a sunburn) but the Aquaphor and a soft sport bra made it bearable. I think the most important thing for me was to not let the shower water hit directly on my breast.  I tried to shield the pressure of the water as much as possible.  I didn't experience any pain, just a mild discomfort similar to a sunburn.  And after my skin was healed the BEST was Johnson & Johnsons lavendar cornstarch!  Was a soft treat for my new skin!!  Good Luck. I hope this helps!   Deb",
