Give yourself the g i f t of complete down time. Besides you will be through with the treatment soon and back in the swing of your ordinary every day life soon enough. A year from now you will be kicking yourself that you didn't take some time to pamper yourself, to baby yourself, to be allowed to be a flake with no consequences. I say go for it. Give some good books, turn on the telly, sit in the comfy chair or better the big bed and let Joe wait on you hand and foot. Who knows when an offer like this might come along again. It will be good for you and it will be good for Joe. Because he loves you so much he wants only the best for you and he wants to see you well rested. So if you can't do it for yourself, do it for Joe. You have been through so much and been so strong but it does take its toil on us. If you get all this rest this weekend you will be super charged to complete your treatments and head home. So rest dear Moopy cause we're having a party when this is done and you have to be able to keep up. Stef",

I used to feel that I shouldn't complain because my tumor was 1 cm, no nodes, no chemo, only radiation and arimidex and a lumpectomy. No complications etc. But then I thought, wait, it was surgery, it was cancer, it was radiation. So no matter how much or how little treatment is involved, we are here with prayers and good thoughts and reassurances. So go into this knowing we all care and all will be in those rooms with you, crowding in to hold your hand and stroke you brow. Stef",

      "Content": "From what I have read, the breasts start the development process before we see boobs. It also involves rapidly dividing cells and hormone changes. Cancer is also rapidly dividing cells. I think that they said they said that she had both IDC and another form of breast cancer. If you have seen the pictures and videos of her, she is a mature 10 year old. I had a friend that at ten was wearing a 34 B bra so this little girl may have had enough breast tissue to develop cancer. It still sucks big time and it is still so rare that a child would develop breast cancer. Just like it is less common for a 40 year old to develop cancer than a 60 year old. I just think that it is so sad that a young girl who should be looking forward to her 1st bra and all that is having to deal with this instead. I remember the angst of puberty and I can't imagine what it would be like if I had a mastectomy and had to deal with all that involves. I had a friend who had a cyst removed when she was 8. It was just below her breast area and where it was removed left a large scar. This caused one breast to be noticably smaller than the other when we all started developing. She was also very self conscious about it so I can't fathom what this might do to this child. She is so upbeat and I hope that in addition to fine physical care, that her emotional needs are met. This may be easier for her to deal with now than later. At 16, she could actually feel the trauma from this more. I only hope that she comes through this both physically and mentally. She has a lot of support from her family, friends and community and that will be so good for her. My prayers and thoughts are with her and her family. Stef",

      "Content": "Cricket, I like Suzanne's analogy about cancer and a book club.  It's not that some people no longer care we have/had cancer but they didn't read the book. As for cancer lurking over your shoulder, those feelings vary among us.  No one way to feel is right or wrong.  We just have to cope with how we feel.  If it becomes overwhelming then we probably need to address the concern with our doctors.  It is never good for anyone to let something rule their lives.  But what you seem to be experiencing seems very normal.  You are not really that far out from your treatments and you have several issues that you are still actively dealing with.  They are physical reminders of your cancer.  It's like putting something on a shelf that's a little too small, it keeps fallilng off.  With time the shelf should get larger and you will be picking it up less.   It helped me to move on by not letting my worries about tomorrow rob me of today.  Someone here once said Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, enjoy today.  Not always easy but a good philosophy for me.    As far as the wigs, I can relate but not wig wise.  Mine is wardrobe related.  My weight has always flucuated.  Every time I would lose weight I would keep my \"fat\" clothes and it always seemed as soon as I got rid of them my weight went back on.  It actually went back on gradually but it seemed like a curse.  For good or bad, my weight is up and has been for years. I am okay with it but should I ever see 120 pounds again I am keeping my \"fat\" clothes as insurance.  So keep the wigs.  Think of them as your comfy blankie.  My sister kept hers cause they give her a sense of security.  Know that this site is a wonderful haven where you can ask questions, vent, rant, celebrate and share your knowledge.  Giving to others can really help you to deal with your own situation.  We have had some sisters who give love, support and advise while battling through stage IV, some right until they lost their fights.  Sad, yes, but also such an inspiration of their spirits and strength.  I hope that you find a place among us.   We hate that you need to be here but we welcome you as a sister.

      "Content": "One of the things that they do where I was treated is to send all patients who had nodes removed to a group lymphedema class. It covers all the basics. They show you samples of sleeves, gauntlets, and leg compression garments (for those with nodes removed from the leg & pelvic area). They show you how to do lymph massage, give you handouts, talk about flying, answer questions. The person that teaches the class is a lymphedema PT and if anyone needs to consult her because they are having issues they can make an appointment after the class. We were told at any signs of swelling or problems to call for an appointment. I found it informative and reassuring to take this class. We were also told that two sleeves and gauntlets are covered each year if we need them. Before surgery I was sent to a breast care specialist and she explained all the options for surgery, talked about sentinel node dissection, answered questions, gave me two heart shaped little pillows which were wonderful to use when driving or lying down, and set me up with 2 online programs to watch. The first was having lumpectomy and the second having mastectomy. They were informative and even printed out questions to ask at the end. It covered sentinel node removal, possible wire quided procedures. You could watch both or either one (if you knew which procedure you had decided on). I found that having these to help before and after not only eased my mind but answered many of my questions. My medical group does a lot of this type of thing. Diabetes classes, nutrition, PHASE (preventing heart attacks & strokes everyday), etc. The cost is low and many are free and they really help to clarify things and give you tips on things related to the issue they deal with. I wish more treatment groups did the breast cancer specialist visit and the lymphadema class after surgery. They were so helpful and I know many here would have appreciated them. Stef",

You don't want to wait too long to get treatmen as they can get serious. Do you also have a full feeling in your bladder? If it turns out not to be bladder infection or kidney, ask them to do an IVP in addition to any catscans etc. I had one done when I was passing lots of blood in my urine. It is a good test to take a look at kidneys, utheters, and the bladder. Much less invasion than a cystoscope but that is a good test also. Most of the time flank pain is related to kidney infections but you want to have them make sure that is all it is. Am I remembering right that you have had your uterus and ovaries removed? I will keep you in my prayers that this is something sorta simple. And I will eat some ice cream just for luck. I have missed you and Mimi and so many of the others. But I also have not been as active here. Keep us informed on what is determined on this and remember, you are not allowed to have any serious going on. Okay. Stef",

I forgot that not long ago I went to the ER with horrid flank pain, vomiting, and passing blood (how did I forget this). I was filling out the paper work and puking into a funny little bag they gave me. Then I had to pee in a cup, they put me in a room and gave me wonderful drugs to take away the pain. I was there for several hours. They did a catscan but couldn't determine anything but I peed several times with blood and pain and they felt it was possible that I passed the stone before the catscan. I went home after several more hours, no more pain and no more blood. So maybe a kidney stone. My pain came in waves, almost like labor pains, started dull and got sharper and then would go away. But what Joe said could also be he cause. Aren't you glad you have all of us doctors to help you out (read mislead you) with this. Hope the pain goes away and Joe is right, it is not cancer. Stef",

Chen was one of those people that if we are very lucky  we come to know.  She was knowledgable, caring, empathetic, full of humor.  When we would have debates that would occasionally get out of hand she was always the voice of reason.  She touched every person she met her in a positive way.   Everyone here who knew her is better for the experience and even when she stopped posting her advice was often brought up and passed along.  Her Hogwarts analogy is a classic and is just one of many.  She shared so much of herself and her family.  Some of you had the privilege of meeting her in person.  I envy you.  She was the original organizer of the ornament exchange and when I missed being a part that first year she sent me an ornament.  This was our Chenheart, Our dear Claudia, our 50 foot woman.  I hope her passing is as gentle as she is and my kindest thoughts and prayers go out to her family.  Stef",

Hoping if it has to be something it is the other because that would be here today and gone tomorrow or whenever. Glad you are enjoying life and wow two years has really gone by quickly. yes, there are some things that cancer has left us with, but some like hot flashes etc. might have been in the future anyway. I think that the most important thing that we can do for ourselves is to accept what we cannot change and live our lives to the fullest. We are only promised today and we should make it count. And that's what you are doing. I do miss you here but as long as you check in once in awhile it's okay. Now I must go look for some ice cream. Stef",

I have seen in other posts by her that she recognizes that these are real side effects and they need to be addressed. I don't think she was dismissing the use of medication to help handle these. I think what she was saying is that she is taking a proactive stance and becoming the person (well and strong) that she was before cancer. I have had problems with depression and used medication but I know that exercise and positive self reinforcement aid in this. She was talking about what worked for her and how it was helping her mood and mindset. Not all depression has to be treated with medication but certainly many do. Depression comes in degrees and cause and solution. Pitt was just telling us how well what she was doing was helping her. For those that are using medication, that is what they should be doing. In this journey we have seen how different it is for each of us and every suggestion that is give have some that will use it and be successful and for others a different suggestion or solution will work. I know you have your struggles and you are addressing them in the way that is working for you. Please don't feel that she meant to diminish your struggles. Pitt was just sharing what is working for her. My prayers are with you during this journey. It's a hard struggle and we each look for our own path. But I love that we all (including you) are sharing strategies for success. And Pitt, isn't it funny how a little elderly man you don't know can make your day? Stef",

Me, I only ever peeked once, it was a bride doll from my grandma. I swear she encouraged peeking as she only put things in a box and tied a loose bow around them. I reached in and felt it but didn't actually look. I only knew it was a doll, had real hair, a long dress and a veil but knowing even that spoiled it for me so I just never peeked at anything again.

She replied, \"I don't want to leave it alone I want to catch and show it to my children\". So he pulled his lunch out of his paper bag and they gave chase. They caught and mom brought it home for us to see and then we all returned to the park to release it. I am picturing you running all higgedity piggedity to safety. Arms waving and shouting loud explecitives at the top of your lungs. I also see you doing your job with a large stick in one hand to beat off any further encounters. I didn't know that St Patrick also got rid of the snakes from England. He must have been very busy. I wonder if Scotland has many snakes. Maybe it was a British Isles type of purge.

I have used them but often just refer to cancer by its name but I know for many it is hard to say that word. When I was first diagnosed 11 years ago I hated saying or thinking the word so in my head I substituted something I always disliked. This is going to sound weird but here goes, my cancers are black licorice. When a close friend developed cancer a few years later she asked how I coped and I told her my word so she chose her own special term. I am not advocating calling it black licorice instead of the beast because many love that candy. Just thought I would share this. Outloud I use the word cancer or \"this disease\". I guess what I am trying to say it doesn't really matter what we call it, it's how we fight it. I think that is how warrior evolved because we fight fiercely. But I am okay with whatever term someone uses and would be happy to hear other suggestions. It's like the term survivor. It's so subjective. But the bottom line is just what Janelle said To Good Health. Our hearts are with Claudia and Janelle expressed everything I would have said to her and about her. Thank you Janelle. Stef GO FIGHT WIN I just thought of a word phrase \"The Foe\".",

He saw the in home PT for the last time on Wednesday and Thursday we went to his doctor appointment (check up after the stroke) and he walked down the stairs with only a little assistance and from the car to the medical center and back and felt tired but fine. He is eating more soft foods but still needs the liquids thickened. He will continue to be followed by the nurse for his wound but it is healing and the speech therapist checks in weekly and will be with us for a little while longer. He can do outpatient PT but he really can do all his exercises here at home. If we opt not to do this now we have change our minds later and the doctor will do a referral. He needs help showering (we have a chair) but other than that he is getting around on his own. As awful as this was it could have been so much worse. On the 15th he goes for a vascular ultrasound of his legs to see if there is anything specific that is causing his legs to swell. This was ongoing long before all this. They recently took him off the blood pressure meds cause it was too low. They did up his betablocker to bring down his heart rate and that all seems to be helping. All in all things are going very well and small progress is celebrated. I have to go on the 15th to an diabetic care management to start insulin, which of course, I am delighted about. NOT But it's not really a surprise. I knew it was coming. My numbers are crazy lows and highs and don't stay stable. I am at the max on meds so this is the next step. I am overweight but with taking arimidex I am happy that I have lost even a few pounds and kept them off. I do exercise 20 minutes a day and now I do much more moving around and walking. I eat healthy and regularly. I know if my weight was way lower this might have been avoided but my doctor also said that over time diabetes can become more difficult to control. So I will do what I have to do and shots don't bother me at all. On the 20th I do my mammo which will be fine and then on the 22nd I see my NP for my uterine cancer check up. She is my fav medical person and I expect the visit to be routine. Next month, Den will go in for another check up and I go to the dermatologist to have my skin looked at for any new skin cancers (that will be good also) and in early October I do my cystoscopy for bladder cancer which I am less sure about being fine but will do whatever I need to do if it's not. One good thing is that if, and it's an if, it is back it will be small and low grade and we have a plan (one I hate) but a plan. So all in all life is good and I have my glass firmly in hand and am in a happy place. I have all of you, especially those facing problems of any type, in my prayers and good thoughts. Thank you for asking about us. I so appreciate the support of this board. Stef",

My dad always made the stuffing and it was always excellent. It was late and dark out and raining. It wasjust before our bedtime and dad was getting ready to prepare his stuffing for the next day when the electricity went out. My parents owned one pathetic flashlight and had only a few candles and no fireplace. My brother was 8 and my sister was 5 and none of us wanted to go to the back of the dark house so mom and dad had us all sitting around the kitchen table and while mom held the flashlight and we sat at the table by candlelight, dad put together his stuffing. He added the spices and celery and apples and whatever else he usually put in. It wasn't easy to see what he was doing. All the while he is telling us funny stories because we are all scared of the dark and imagining monsters in every shadow. When he was done we all grabbed hands and went into the living room. Mom got blankets from all the beds and we all settled in. I don't know when the electricity came back on but it was on the next morning. That afternoon Grandma and Grandpa Wright, Great Grandpa Wright, and my aunt and uncle and all the rest of the family arrived. When dinner was served everyone said that the stuffing was the best they had ever tasted. It really was. When they asked Dad what he did different this year he told them He was totally in the dark as to what made it so good. And we all laughed. And let me ask you ladies that are 50 or older didn't the turkey seem to take so much longer to cook. I can remember mom putting it in the oven in the morning and it wasn't ready until late afternoon. Stef",

You appear to have really great eyebrows that have a great shape and that you don't use much product on. You could practice now while there are still there. Great a couple types of brow pencils or cake style with a brush and trace over your brows. Use feathery strokes, go heavy with it and get the shape down. Do it several times a day. You can wash it off after. This should help you get the feel for your brows. Also take a picture of your eyes and brows to use as a guide. I have always had nearly non existant brows and it took awhile to get the hang of doing my brows so they didn't look like I had painted them in. Now I don't care because my glasses pretty much hide them. Also there are some classes offered by ACS that can help. Forget the name but someone will remember. I am sorry to hear about your mom and hope that she it is nothing but she is lucky she has you to help through all of this. I will keep good thoughts prayers for you and your mom. Stef",

      "Content": "The company I work for was part of their city's (Benicia) 1st Relay for Life this year. Our group took breast cancer as its theme for their tent. We had another woman from my job that made the most amazing quilt to raffle. Another did a great informational board on breast cancer. And we had cupcakes, nutrition bars to sell. We also had ties that one of worker's spouse had her 3rd grade classes decorate. All the ties were donated to the class and the kids used that puffy paint and decorated them with a cure for cancer theme. These were sold for dollar each and when I left the Relay at 11, there weren't many left. VEONA (Voices of Eve and Angels) is this incredible children's chorus in Benica (one of their former singers Holly Stiel at the age of 11 sang with Boticelli and Parvarotti) sang at the opening and led the survivor lap. They range in age from 6 to 16 (I think) and they were unbelievable. This relay surpassed the average for a 1st year relay. 1st year Relay usually total about 25,000 and the relay raised over 80,000. It is the 3rd or 4th year I have gone as a survivor, but my first year on a team. It, as always, for inspirational. But what I really wanted to share was a woman (a friend of a co-worker) I met. She is this tiny little woman who is in the middle of her battle with breast cancer. She walked the survivor lap, then the care giver lap and then the team lap. She is 3 weeks from her last chemo and said that 2 weeks ago she couldn't have walked at all and she was going for all she could. She starts radiation in a couple more weeks. Her head is still bald and she was wearing a cap, but when we were taking pictures she took it off so that we could take pictures of her head. Her grandchildren had drawn a ying/yang sign on the top of her head. She said that they love to draw pictures on her head and do it all the time. She also told me that when she knew she was going to have chemo and that hair loss was a given, she had them cut her below the waist length hair. She said one of them cut her side to just above her ears so she could put it behind her ears, but one other wanted to see how short she could cut her side so it was close to the scalp. She said that she didn't change it at all until she actually shaved it all off. She said that when she went out, some people looked at her a little strangely. I think it was important to her to honor her grandchildren. I think that was the neatest story I have heard about how to cope with the loss of hair. And she must have made her grandchildren so less fearful of what was happening with her. She was really an inspiration to me and I know that if I ever have to have chemo, that is exactly what I am going to do. The drawings on the head could be another alternative to scarves, hats, etc. I remember when I had my pelvic rads that I drew a shamrock above my radiation area on my belly for St Patrick's Day and the techs laughed themselves silly. They even had the doctors come in and take a look. So maybe head drawings would distract people from the shock of seeing a bald headed lady. On a humorous note, because I work for a construction company, I suggested (tongue in cheek) that we take a pair of hard hats, paint them pale pink, paint darker pink nipples and use them to decorate our area. But now that I am home, I wished I had gone a step further and suggested we do this and write the stats for breast cancer and survival rates and importance of mammograms all over hard hat boobs. Let's face it, it would grab people's attention and isn't that the point to all this. That's me, a day and a dollar short. Well, next year, I am doing the pink informational hard hat breasts. Stef",

I was wondering why did they do surgery on both breasts to take out the lump and why no path report? That would have been done on the lump, not by a scan. Did they address the coughing up of blood? You seriously need to get her to you. Germany will have treatment facilities and you can, as someone suggested, marry her. If you are a citizen then she should be eligible for assistance if you don't have finances. Again, my prayers are with you both. Stef",

We will be doing yearly checks for these and if I find any between visits I am to make an appointment and come right in. This is all part of the Muir Torre Syndrome which is a sub set of the Lynch Syndrome. They are setting up a colonoscopy and endoscopy after the holidays and I will be doing this yearly also. But the good thing is that they will do them together under light sedation. It's the same prep so why do it twice. Then I will be good for a year. And I still plan to dance with NED after my oncology visit cause this little skin cancer is going to be history and it is not something to fret about. So there! NED better get his tap shoes out cause I feel like doing an Old Soft Shoe. Tasha, did you really forget an appointment? I have done that and then I feel such a fool. So other than the memory lapse, how are you dear daft sod? Stef",

      "Content": "There are many reasons that you would feel this is worse than breast cancer. It's not you but someone you love. It's not something that will get better and that is so heartbreaking. Emotional abuse from whatever source or reason is still abuse and hard to deal with. You cannot control any of this. I think that dementia in a loved one is probably one of the hardest things to have to accept. You need to find ways to get assistance with your husband. Call in the friends, family etc. to give you time off from care giving (my friend's husband had several of us that would come over for a hour or two once a week so he could have some time off). Try to find a support group or online site that can give you suggestions on coping mechanisms. Practice breathing exercises and walk away if you can when he gets abusive. Say over and over to yourself, this is not him, it's the disease. Tell your doctors exactly what is going on and ask for whatever help, medical or emotional, they can give. And if things progress to the point that this is impacting your physical and mental health, then you need to seriously think through what is the best solution for all of you. You cannot jeopordize your health and I don't think your husband would want you to. This is just my opinion and it is not given lightly or I know it may sound harsh, but this type of disease affects the caregivers like no other. I watched my friend slip away bit by bit until there was no recognition left. And I watched the toll it took on her husband. He cared for her until it just became too difficult and when he was at the point that he needed to place her in a care facility she passed away from an infection I understand with Pick's that often happens). Pick's does not have the long prognosis of Alzheimers but it shows up much younger. We are here to vent to if you need to, but you need to investigate all your physical resources. Stress is bad for us with cancer but it is also bad for our general health. So find an outlet for your needs, be it exercise, a class at a local college, a evening out with friends, something that you do just for you and that relieves the caregiving and all that is going on. I wish I could offer more help as I know this is so hard and so unfair. We should have only one problem on our plates at a time. Stef",

I want to hold, cherish, enjoy and love my ornament from the second it arrives. So if you want it to be opened at the last possible moment don't mail it early. LOL It will join my beautiful shoe that Chen sent me last year. She is such a darling. We were going through a lot of turmoil with our house going into foreclosure and just lots of life stuff going on so I opted to not do the exchange. Didn't even know what our address would be. I so enjoyed hearing everyone receiving and loving there ornaments and lived quite vicariously through the others. I commented on how wonderful this exchange was and how much I was enjoying the excitement of all those that were participating. Chen, the dearheart that she is wrote and asked if she could have my address and send me one. How could I refuse? To say I was tickled, honored and just plain felt loved by a kindred spirit did more than she will ever know to bring joy into my heart at a time when I really needed a boost. So this year, I am participating and will be sending my ornament soon and I want my buddy to open it immediately and enjoy it at once. I can understand others wanting their buddies to wait but I just know I won't be able to. This exchange is so much fun and brings so much to each of us. It's having a little tangible something from someone who is linked to our hearts. Chen, you are embody the spirit of the season. Thank you for then, now and always. Stef",

Also for jobs that need bonding etc. I think it is too bad that an employer would assume because you have had credit problem that you would steal which is what these checks imply to me. One way that might help is to write to the various credit bureau and explain the reason for the bad credit, husband ran up bills, husband left, major illness etc. I believe that you have the right to have this information in your credit report as well. If not, then be up front with employers without giving specifics, just say that divorce and medical bills caused this credit problem. Some employers may not hire knowing this but some will. When I went for my job interview 2 years ago, I told them that I part of the reason for a gap in my work history was major surgery for cancer and it did not deter them from hiring me.

And you have met it with courage, strength, and while going through all this you have been here for everyone with solid advice, kind words and true caring. That sounds pretty perfect to me. And strong, smart, and stable. Yes, there are all the health issues to deal with but I know how hard you work at your health, exercise, and all the other stuff. You need to step back and look at your life through the same eyes that you view other's lives. Be kinder to yourself. This is a tough journey and it does have so many ups and downs, highs and lows. And it is very likely that hormone levels are changing and that would warrant a call to your doctor. This is a safe place to vent and I know that you will bounce back but sometimes we do need to just say that life is sucking the big one right now. As far as friends pitying you and being glad they aren't you, that could be true but then they have their own set of problems to deal with. I have friends with better health but I wouldn't be them with their family issues or job problems for anything. I always thought that I would like to buy old dishes and take them out to a big metal (has to be metal) garbage can and just throw them into it while yelling at the top of my lungs, maybe even swearing too. Love the crashy bangy sounds. It seems like it would be so soothing. Instead I get in the shower and cry while the water washes down my face. Then I can pretend I am not really crying, it just shower water. But most of the time, I try to look at all that I have that is good. Just know we are all here for you, it's okay to cry and vent and rant and rave, and that we so care for you. This too, shall pass. Stef",

A thought for the future might be to see if they do or can refer you for a virtual colonoscopy. It is the same prep (ugh but doable) and they have to put air in the colon so bloating might be an issue but you will know to wear sweat pants with a stretchy waist. Not sure if your pain was from the bloating but they can give you some meds now that you know you have the problem. But what is good about the virtual is that they don't pass the camera in you but do it from the outside. it would allow they to see the last part of the colon. I know with my syndrome that is often the area where the cancer begins. They have no trouble getting all the way on me and I don't know why but I don't get bloating. Some do, some don't. I do cut back all my food and especially fiber etc the day before the prep but that might or might not make a difference. Just thought I would throw this out there should you ever need another one. I know you said you wouldn't do one but if it became necessary it's a thought. Have they said what the blockage was? It is such a pain in the a$$ (pun intended) when they can't get the job done.

Not very cost effective, huh? I am not sure it is just an insurance thing or if it is a medical issue. Like not having excessive dental xrays.

      "Content": "Denise, You are definitely an old hand at this. I have had 3 and now will be doing them yearly. Poor Susan, that was just not fun but you are right most of them are without incident. Like Denise, I cut back the day before the prep. I have done two types of prep. The gallon plus of fun. Just so salty tasting. And once I did one with a small bottle of some kind of stuff. Drank like 4 or 6 oz with 7 up and two ducolax tablets and then the next day the other 4 or 6 oz. It isn't done much anymore because it is very hard on the kidneys but gosh it was so much easier than that gallon jug. TMI but I clean out very well and very easily for which I am grateful. And I never feel anything or have pain afterward. One time they did my cystosscopy and colonoscopy during the same time. And my last one they did the endoscopy that I will be doing yearly with it. I figure go in to as many orifices as you need to and cut down on the need to be put under. I find the dehydration the worst and they usually have to give me insulin because for some reason my sugars go way up. Then they go down and they give me juice when I wake up or maybe they give everyone juice. I will keep you in my prayers and good thoughts that all goes well and that it is without incident. Let us know how it turns out. Stef",

It's odd that he felt you needed the pain killers if you havn't had them before. I didn't have any with my last colonoscopy. Sorry for that set back. It's bad enough to have this stuff done but add puking after it and ugh. And yes, the vomiting can make you so weak. After all you have already fasted, cleaned everything from your body and are so dehydrated. Hope you are feeling better and that the results were good. My daughter's name is Denise also. I just love the name. Don't hear it too often. Stef",
