    "Content": "May I suggest asking him if he'd like to just go to the Disney \"area\" with you and your daughter during his vacation? He can rest and do nothing - sit by the pool, lie in the hotel and watch TV, maybe even take in a round of golf; while you and your daughter do the tourist thing. Don't bug him to go into the park, just let him enjoy doing nothing. I've sometimes gone to a hotel within miles of my home just so I don't even SEE the dishes that could be washed, or the floors that could be mopped, or the bed that needs to be made --- I just go to a hotel, bring a good book and get away from housework looking me in the face. He may enjoy it -- if he doesn't go, I hope you have a good time!",
