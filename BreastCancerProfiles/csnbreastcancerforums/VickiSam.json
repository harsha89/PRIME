You truly are suffering from chemo infused side efforts -- we are NOT numbers, our side efforts don't all fall within that 'Bell Standard' chemo side efforts chart -- which is decades old. Insist on speaking with your Oncologist - one, on one. If he blows you off, or dismisses your health concerns -- seek a 2nd, or 3rd opinion. ** Please get copies of all your medical records, chemo infusions etc -- before proceeding to a new Oncologist. This will streamline your first appointment, and provide some insight to your NEW Onco's course of action. This is your BODY, your LIFE. Strength, Courage, and HOPE for a Cure. Vicki Sam",

Bailey was potty trained (in less than 1 week) no kidding. She has always been MY dog, not the families. Since my lump surgery on 8/10, she now my shadow. I can not go to the bathroom without inviting her in. If I am upstairs cleaning etc, and Bailey is downstairs she will cry until someone removes the baby gate .. she just wants to be with me 24/7. She senses I am upset, and that something is up, and wrong with me. She has resorted to sitting on my feet (like now) whe I am on the computer, or in my lap when I am in the family room. Lap dog, yes .. however here in Corona,CA .. humid and sticky, even with the A/C blasting all day. She will sit and pant heavily until I say ok .. she gives me this look that is so hard to describe -- like .. will you be ok, Mom. Sadiness in her eyes. I feel she knows what the next year of so will be like for me battleing breast cancer. You might ask yourself, why the baby gate if Bailey is such a good dog .. Well, my husband and I bought a TeaCup Yorkie (2.4 lbs current weight) for our daughters 18th birthday. Alexandra loves her dog Emma Rose .. but like many teenagers, forgets to take her potty and potty training is not going too well... friends, shopping or on the phone. I plan on fixing this next week, when Ally returns to school on 8/31. Best of Luck with Patches and her training. Vicki",

Plastic stem ware helps with that metallic taste some of us Chemo Queens suffer from -- Baking soda helps with mouth sores, so I brushed my teeth daily using baking soda. Biotene mouth wash (alcohol free) also came in handy when my mouth needed soothing. Cotton caps worn at night to help with the cold weather. I also found comfort wearing them to bed. Hydrate before, during and after each and every treatment. It helps to add, lemonade, cranberry juice anything to water. Lipton or Crystal light supplement aids also do the trick!

Each day will bring with it new developments and tears, please find a safe place (like our site) to regenerate yourself and your emotions. Perhaps, Leslie may want you to write down a few special words to each girl, during her more lucid times - record her voice and words ... cherished memories.

Taste buds gone already .. so back to eating yogurt, cottage chesse, banana's, soup and my favorite . apple sauce .. Oh JOY. Taking Emend, so no throwing up or neusea-altho .. I feel a bit sick to my stomach for some reason, I have some green pill for neusea in my cabinet, so I will pop 1 tablet after signing off our board tonight. Nose drips started several weeks ago, first my right side, then my left 2 days later. Twitching of my right eye has continued for just about 10 days .. constant. My eyes have teared up first my right then my left .. I have tried several eye drops .. what has worked for me is Claratin eye drops and Vasoline 'Red'. I alternate between the two, and now for 3 days have minminal eye tears ... meaning I am no longer dripping from both eyes, all day long ... I am now waiting for my for my ears to start spitting out blood or liquid .. GEEZ can we all say it together. FYI .. I change my pillow case everyday .. I still have my nose hair, and southern region hair .. I continue to shave my underarms and legs, not as frequently. My eyebrows have thinned out, as well as my eye lashes, but I still am sporting both .. 10 weeks into 18 of my continuous chemo torture, oops I mean treatments.

Reaching up and grabbing heavy items -- will tear your stitches, as well as hurt your arms. Muscles and tissue in breast, as well as arm areas will be cut, moved and sewn back together. I tried to take a bath ..but hence could not pull myself out of the our spa tub, no muscles or strength in my arms after bilateral mastectomy.. It took my husband, and daughter some time to pull me out of the tub == without hurting me. Not a pretty time, or sight to say the least. So I opted to shower ...My husband removed our shower head, and replaced it with a flex hose type so I could shower maneuvering the flex hose from waist down, as well as place shower water under my arms. Lastly, please make sure you do your exercises as prescribed by Plastic Surgeon, and Physical Therapist. .......... Tissue Expander fills TE inserted at the time of my bilateral mastectomy. 3 weeks later, I had my first fill of 120cc per breast (my suggestion --- start of with a lesser dose of fluid). There is a pinch when the needle enters each breast -- and later there is a tightness due to the increase of fluids. Try try try 60 cc first go around to to gage what you will be dealing with. Just a suggestion. My health care insurance was running short -- so my fills, surgeries -- schedules, were fast paced. Ibuprofen taken 1 hours before fill helps, as well as frozen peas (lighter than an ice pack) placed on each breast to help with the inflammation due to fill. Ask Plastic Surgeon staff for tips!

You will be overwhelmed with information and jargon. With all chemo therapy infused drugs .. there are side efforts, and many of us WARRIORS .. suffer from 1 or 2, while others suffer a great deal. I had taxotere, carboplatin, and herceptin ... I did suffer with mouth and throat sores (Tom Natural toothpaste helped); the steroids and other meds helped with my nauseated before and during chemo .. after chemo infusions -- nausea plagued me for several days (everybody is different -- just my case, and my body) I did suffer with fatigue and bouts and constipation issues - please do not hesitate to call your Oncologist in attempts to find relief. Hydrate, rest, and hydrate some more. Small meals can often help with nausea. I also splashed / flavored my never ending water consumptions with crystal light, lemonade, cranberry juice or apple juice. Herbal tea worked in the evenings, for me. .. drinking plain water endlessly, got a little boring for me. Lastly, please put your Oncologist telephone on speed dial .. and call when any and all concerns - regardless of time of day or night! Strength, Courage and Hope. Strength, Courage and Hope.

      "Content": "  Port In medicine, a port (or portacath) is a small medical appliance that is installed beneath the skin. A catheter connects the port to a vein. Under the skin, the port has a septum through which drugs can be injected and blood samples can be drawn many times, usually with less discomfort for the patient than a more typical \"needle stick\". Ports are used mostly to treat hematology and oncology patients, but recently ports have been adapted also for hemodialysis patients. The port is usually inserted in the upper chest, just below the clavicle or collar bone, leaving the patient's hands free. How it works The catheter runs from the portal and is surgically inserted into a vein (usually the jugular vein, subclavian vein, or superior vena cava). Ideally, the catheter terminates in the superior vena cava, just upstream of the right atrium. This position allows infused agents to be spread throughout the body quickly and efficiently. A port consists of a reservoir compartment (the portal) that has a silicone bubble for needle insertion (the septum), with an attached plastic tube (the catheter). The device is surgically inserted under the skin in the upper chest or in the arm and appears as a bump under the skin. It requires no special maintenance and is completely internal so swimming and bathing are not a problem. The catheter runs from the portal and is surgically inserted into a vein (usually the jugular vein, subclavian vein, or superior vena cava). Ideally, the catheter terminates in the superior vena cava, just upstream of the right atrium. This position allows infused agents to be spread throughout the body quickly and efficiently. The septum is made of a special self-sealing silicone rubber; it can be punctured hundreds of times before it weakens significantly. To administer treatment or to withdraw blood, a health professional will first locate the port and disinfect the area. Then he or she will access the port by puncturing the overlying skin with a 90° Huber point needle although a winged needle may also be used. (Due to its design, there is a very low infection risk, as the breach of skin integrity is never larger than the caliber of the needle. This gives it an advantage over indwelling lines such as the Hickman line.) Negative pressure is created to withdraw blood into the vacuumized needle, to check for blood return and see if the port is functioning normally. Next, the port will be flushed with a saline solution. Then, treatment will begin. After each use, a heparin lock is made by injecting a small amount of heparinized saline (an anticoagulant) into the device. This prevents development of clots within the port or catheter. In some catheter designs where there is a self-sealing valve at the far end, the system is locked with just saline. The port can be left accessed for as long as required. The port is covered in a dressing to protect the site from infection and to secure the needle in position. If a port is used infrequently, it may be necessary to access the port, flush it with saline, and inject a new heparin lock every month to prevent clotting between uses. The surgery itself is considered minor, and is typically performed under both local anaesthesia and conscious sedation. Patients sometimes have a little discomfort after the procedure, and can be managed with a narcotic, such as demerol for 24\u201348 hours. A port is most commonly inserted as a day surgery procedure in a hospital or clinic by a surgeon or an interventional radiologist, under conscious sedation. When no longer needed, the port can be removed in the operating room.   Picc Line What is a PICC Line and Why Do I Need It?   A PICC line is, by definition and per its acronym, a peripherally inserted central catheter. It is long, slender, small, flexible tube that is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically in the upper arm, and advanced until the catheter tip terminates in a large vein in the chest near the heart to obtain intravenous access. It is similar to other central lines as it terminates into a large vessel near the heart. However, unlike other central lines, its point of entry is from the periphery of the body � the extremities. And typically the upper arm is the area of choice. A PICC line provides the best of both worlds concerning venous access. Similar to a standard IV, it is inserted in the arm, and usually in the upper arm under the benefits of ultrasound visualization. Also, PICCs differ from peripheral IV access but similar to central lines in that a PICCs termination point is centrally located in the body allowing for treatment that could not be obtained from standard periphery IV access. In addition, PICC insertions are less invasive, have decreased complication risk associated with them, and remain for a much longer duration than other central or periphery access devices. Using ultrasound technology to visualize a deep, large vessel in the upper arm, the PICC catheter is inserted by a specially trained and certified PICC nurse specialist. Post insertion at the bedside, a chest x-ray is obtained to confirm ideal placement. The entire procedure is done in the patient�s room decreasing discomfort, transportation, and loss of nursing care. A PICC line may requested for a variety of treatment options which include some of the following: -Prolonged IV antibiotic treatment; -IV access obtainable by less invasive and longer lasting methods; -Multiple accesses obtainable with one access line; -TPN Nutrition; -Chemotherapy;; -IV access related to physiological factors; and -Home or sub-acute discharge for extended treatment. PICCs are frequently used to obtain central venous access for patients in acute care, home care and skilled nursing care. Since complication risks are less with PICC lines, it is preferred over other forms of central venous catheters. A PICC is not appropriate for all patients. Proper selection to determine the appropriateness of this device is required. The PICC may have single or multiple lumens. This depends on how many intravenous therapies are needed. A PICC line can be used for antibiotics, pain medicine, chemotherapy, nutrition, or for the drawing of blood samples. PICCs can be inserted by radiologists, physician assistants or certified registered nurses. They are inserted using ultrasound technology at the bedside or ultrasound wit fluoroscopy. Chest radiographs are also used to confirm placement of the PICC tip if it was not inserted using fluoroscopy.  ",

Disposable razors can cut and nick your scalp, which can then cause infection. Please be sure to use sun screen when not wearing a hat, or scarf outside - remember to slather sun screen on the back of your neck, and ears as well. I went outside once to pick up dogie do (chemo underway), and I ended up with my ears and scalp = sun burned. Then again, I live in Southern California. T-Gel neutrogena shampoo helps with scalp soothing, and helps prevent new follicles to become clogged from sweat or other pollutions in the air. I also conditioned my scalp weekly, just to keep the peach fuzz soft and supple. I also wore, wool or knitted beanies at night to keep my head warm. I had several, so I tried to color coordinate with my pj's. LOL Best of luck .. Vicki Sam",

      "Content": "Taxol Generic Name: Paclitaxel Other Trade Name: Onxal TM Drug Type: What is Taxol? Taxol is an anti-cancer (\"antineoplastic\" or \"cytotoxic\") chemotherapy drug. Taxol is classified as a \"plant alkaloid,\" a \"taxane\" and an \"antimicrotubule agent.\"  (For more detail, see \"How Taxol Works\" section below).   What Taxol Is Used For: Taxol is used for the treatment of breast, ovarian, lung, bladder, prostate, melanoma, esophageal, as well as other types of solid tumor cancers. It has also been used in Kaposi's sarcoma. Note:  If a drug has been approved for one use, physicians sometimes elect to use this same drug for other problems if they believe it might be helpful. How Taxol Is Given: Taxol is given as an injection or infusion into the vein (intravenous, IV).  Taxol is an irritant.  An irritant is a chemical that can cause inflammation of the vein through which it is given.  If the medication escapes from the vein it can cause tissue damage.  The nurse or doctor who gives Taxol must be carefully trained.  If you experience pain or notice redness or swelling at the IV site while you are receiving Taxol, alert your health care professional immediately.  Because severe allergic reactions have occurred in some people taking Taxol, you will be asked to take medications to help prevent a reaction.  Your doctor will prescribe the exact regimen. Taxol is given over various amounts of times and in various schedules.  There is no pill form of Taxol. The amount of Taxol and the schedule that it is given will receive depend on many factors, including your height and weight, your general health or other health problems, and the type of cancer or condition being treated.  Your doctor will determine your dose and schedule. Taxol Side Effects: Important things to remember about Taxol side effects include: Most people do not experience all of the Taxol side effects listed. Taxol side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration. Taxol side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete. There are many options to help minimize or prevent Taxol side effects. There is no relationship between the presence or severity of Taxol side effects and the effectiveness of the medication. The Taxol side effects and their severity vary depending on how much of the drug is given, and/or the schedule in which it is given. The following Taxol side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients taking Taxol: Low blood counts.  Your white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily decrease.  This can put you at increased risk for infection, anemia and/or bleeding. Hair loss Arthralgias and myalgias, pain in the joints and muscles. Usually temporary occurring 2 to 3 days after Taxol, and resolve within a few days.   Peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling of the hands and feet) Nausea and vomiting (usually mild) Diarrhea Mouth sores Hypersensitivity reaction - fever, facial flushing, chills, shortness of breath, or hives after Taxol is given.  The majority of these reactions occur within the first 10 minutes of an infusion.  Notify your healthcare provider immediately (premedication regimen has significantly decreased the incidence of this reaction).  The following are less common side effects (occurring in 10-29%) for patients receiving Taxol: Swelling of the feet or ankles (edema). Increases in blood tests measuring liver function.  These return to normal once treatment is discontinued. (see liver problems). Low blood pressure (occurring during the first 3 hours of infusion). Darkening of the skin where previous radiation treatment has been given (radiation recall - see skin reactions). Nail changes (discoloration of nail beds - rare) (see skin reactions). Nadir:  15-21 days This list includes common and less common side effects for individuals taking Taxol.  Side effects that are very rare, occurring in less than 10% of patients, are not listed here.  However, you should always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms. When To Contact Your Doctor or Health Care Provider: Contact your health care provider immediately, day or night, if you should experience any of the following symptoms: Fever of 100.4° F (38° C), chills (possible signs of infection) Shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, closing up of the throat, swelling of facial features, hives (possible allergic reaction). The following symptoms require medical attention, but are not an emergency.  Contact your health care provider within 24 hours of noticing any of the following: If you notice any redness or pain at the site of injection Nausea (interferes with ability to eat and unrelieved with prescribed medication) Vomiting (vomiting more than 4-5 times in a 24 hour period) Diarrhea (4-6 episodes in a 24-hour period) Unusual bleeding or bruising Black or tarry stools, or blood in your stools or urine Extreme fatigue (unable to carry on self-care activities) Mouth sores (painful redness, swelling or ulcers) Yellowing of the skin or eyes Swelling of the feet or ankles.  Sudden weight gain Signs of infection such as redness or swelling, pain on swallowing, coughing up mucous, or painful urination. Always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms.  ",

I wish I had encourging words to make you feel better. \"Old and Tired\", is what I have felt since receiving my breast cancer diagnosis on Friday, 8/14 at 2:30 p.m. I am bumping into walls, just about killed myself driving over to my sister's house - 20 mintues away yesterday. It's all a DREAM, right? I am IN SHOCK. What I have been doing different today .. is spending 20 to 40 minutes researching, fighting my breast cancer in any possible way. I then allow myself 1 to 2 hours to take a bath, shower, or read a trashy book .. look at a vacation getaway package .. anything to get my mind off of the cancer. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, I just purchased a T-Cup Yorkie on line. Yikes!! I've decided to clean out my pantry, and all kitchen cabinets before having both my breasts removed .. sort of a cleaning phase. I have asked each family member and close friend to 'not' make every conversation, or visit about my breast cancer. I have pleaded with each one to 'lie' to me and tell me how great I look, even when I don't.",

Protein is needed to keep your body strength and White Blood Cells at good levels so you can fight off infections. My experience .. my body .. BBQ - chicken or steak - baked anything did work for me, or any tomatoe based foods. Hydrate with water, you will quickly get sick of just plain water - my suggestion as this worked for me is add a little - apple, grape, cranberry juice to your water. You may also try pink lemonade, crystal lite or lipton pre-pkg'd pouches. Mix anything you can think of with water. Herbal tea's is another great way to get water into your system. Best of luck and let us know how you are doing! Vicki Sam",

How odd that your roommate made everything, all about her. You have taken your first steps into adulthood by suggesting that you 'may' need a little help -- so please if you need help, ask for it. Asking for help does not make you weak, or less self sufficient - it just means that in this phase of your life, where a little help may be required. A good place to start is maybe with Mom. We enjoy taking care of our children when asked. Now that Dad is pulling 12 hour shifts, Mom may enjoy the distraction. You are a ROCK STAR, and all rock stars need assistance every now, and again.

To make matter worst - this is NOT your first time sporting this look! - I can not imagine what you are going thru emotional, and I am so very sorry for that. Please hold on to the fact that you are still Dee - except with less hair. I penciled and brushed on brown eyeshadow for brows, used same for a softer liner look over my eyes. Mac or Revlon - long lasting pencils are GREAT! My makeup stay on longer even with my watery, dripping eyes. I wore hats and scarves, which I match to my outfits... took time and energy, but I enjoyed the on line or in store shopping. 1Teresa .. I am so very sorry that your Mother is no longer with you and her family. Breast Cancer is a ugly and wicked disease. Cancer attacks us .. plain and simple -- it doesn't care if your 31 years of age, or 62 years -- it doesn't take into consideration you martial status, age of your children - or gross income level.

Believe me when I say, side efforts of fatigue - lack of zest for life is all too REAL. Be kind to yourself - spend time reading, watch tv, homework with your children from the comfort of your bed while resting or on the sofa. Remember all the women and men that have fought this battle before us - side efforts and all. We too, will win this breast cancer war. We are stronger and wiser than we think.

Did I mention that our scalp's are bald and we no long look like we did several months ago? Now even strangers know that we are sick and fighting some form of cancer. My opinion, only: It's the hair loss It's the hormones drugs It's the chemo treatments It's all the various sucky side efforts of chemo It's the waiting for phone calls from oncologist or staff It's the fact that we are unable to do all things we did before chemo treatments It's the fact that on most nights - I do not get more than 4 to 5 hours of sleep my list can go on .. but I'll stop here We are FIGHTERS and WARRIORS .. I found my teenager children are more quite about my fight and ask for hugs, my husband on the other hand is sympatic most days. But, he does forget and sometimes coops an attitude - I just go on about my business. I encourge Pete to read, and go to family care for chemo patients therapy as offered by St. Joesph's hospital. He attended 1 class, he may need a few more .. something we'll work on together in the next few weeks. I am humbled by the fact that you will be entertaining again so soon after spending several days with your daughter. You go Girl, and never stop being YOU. Love and prayers .. VickiSam",

My message to you would be, if at all possible, - to ask for some help - reach out to family (mom & dad do not live close enough), maybe have a family member, or friend  --- accompany you to chemo - or just drop by to see how your doing.  People LOVE you, and would be honored to be a part of your life, part of your support team.  It is so difficult to ask for help - or assistance -.

How many times have our children talked us into getting the largest puppy, or alley - flea bitten kitty??? But, an Iguana -- now that's a first in my book. Only you -- with your kind heart, gentle soul, and openness to love any creature - of God -- would this ever be possible. KUDOS to you C.C. for putting forth the effort of providing a loving and caring environment for, Fluffy --. I am sure it would of be so easy to drop him off at any local animal shelter -- but you \"stayed the course? -- Fluffy reciprocated with devotion and commitment to you --. You were his \"Mommy\", so he followed you around - like a little puppy. How special a story! I simply adore the photo of Fluffy 'sunning himself', while reading a book. Thanks for making my day.

You've have 999 posts since joining - December 2008. Considerate, stong willed, productive and consistent is what I pegged you as. Homones are wicked .. I've been on and off of them for 20 plus, as I experience thyroid cancer at very young age of 20. Because I do not have a thyroid, my body does not produce the HGC homone on its own, 6 out of my 7 pregnancies end in miscarriage. After 1 live birth, a premie .. I endured 6 rounds of IVF trying to conceive again, not luck. Homones are wicked. I get have my boy, and adopted a girl from Russia .. many years ago. Dreams do come true. And they will for you, my friend. I have a premonition .. YOU will become a ground breaking filmmaker, many of your films will have untones of personal struggles. You will make it to Sundance and all your sisters from this website will be with you to celebrate. Time is our Friend, anxiety & fear are our enemy.

Ibuprofen taken 1 hours before fill helps, as well as frozen peas (lighter than an ice pack) placed on each breast to help with the inflammation due to fill. small packages of frozen pea's also helped with my inflammation --- Ask Plastic Surgeon staff what they recommend.

Multiple pillows in various, sizes help with sleeping on your back. Please make sure the RN's teach you how to milk your drains before leaving the hospital. Just a suggestion. Please have cups, saucers, plates at arm level - as well as re-arranging your fridge for more commonly used items at arm levels. Tide/Downy small container sizes - also at arm level. Reaching up and grabbing heavy items -- will tear your stitches, as well as hurt your arms. Muscles and tissue in breast, as well as arm areas will be cut,moved and sewn back together. I tried to take a bath ..but hence could not pull myself out of the our spa tub, no muscles or strength in my arms after bilateral mastectomy.. It took my husband, and daughter some time to pull me out of the tub == without hurting me. Not a pretty time, or sight to say the least. So I opted to shower ...My husband removed our shower head, and replaced it with a flex hose type so I could shower maneuvering the flex hose from waist down, as well as place shower water under my arms. Lastly, please make sure you do your exercises as prescribed by Plastic Surgeon, and Physical Therapist. Strength, Courage, Hope and Speedy recovery. Vicki Sam",
