    "Content": "After a bucket of tears, hair is finally shaved. Thanks to my hubby and my daughter, they did an amazing job. There were lots of tears shed, a lots of hugs and kisses but I finally let them do it. The hair loss was just more devastating,like others said, it's was harder to see the clumps of hair falling.. I finally accepted that it was bound to happen anyways. I cannot say it was a relief because I think I still feel numb. Tomorrow is another day, I hope I will be stronger to face the mirror when I wake up. For now, I gonna go sleep with my bandana and try to digest it more. Another step done, a big step for me. I didn't do that bad after all! God is great.",
