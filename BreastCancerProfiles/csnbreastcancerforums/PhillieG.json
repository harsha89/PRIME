    "Content": "I am surprised to read your post and hope that you are just throwing the I'll never do another one again comment in jest. IF you need to do one because you're in a life or death situation, the chances are better toward death. Colon cancer is one of the easiest to \"cure\" if caught early. If you have issues that raise a flag for CC, do yourself a favor and get checked. If you think the colonoscopy is bad, wait until you get a load of the surgeries and chemo that follow...
