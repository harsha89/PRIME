At least now you have peace of mind that your cousin will no longer be physically abused by his own daughter and hopefully his daughter will get the much needed help she so desperately needs.

      "Content": "Shortly after receiving chemo (which ended in this May) I noticed the vision in my \"right\" eye has deteriorated to the point where everything is pretty much a blurr. I used to have good vision in both eyes. My left eye wasn't effected. I intend to go to an eye doctor in January (after my radiation treatments end). I am wondering if I have a cataract as I know this can be a side effect of chemo. I'm hoping it's a cataract and it can be corrected. Has anyone had their vision affected by chemo? What was your outcome? Thank you to all who respond. God Bless, Betsy",
