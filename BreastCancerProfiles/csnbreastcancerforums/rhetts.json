    "Content": "Breasts - Am scheduled to have a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction the end of July 2010. Had Ovarian cancer in 2007 with 6 rounds of chemo in going on my 3rd year of remission. The reason for my current surgery is that my mother passed away from breast cancer in 2009. Was advised to have BRCA test, which is a positive. Also, present is an inverted nipple, which is how my mother started. For now, they do not see cancer, but was informed, at time of surgery, they will be more sure. I'm not having the lymph checked for possible cancer ... I read up about Lymphdema ...I feel already compromised with other issues that I have ie, bursitis, tendinitis, fibro, neuropathy due to chemo. My question to all of you, what to expect, how did you cope with the surgery and reconstruction aspect of it. What advise do you have for me, would be most appreciated. Mar",
