    "Content": "Dear Kathy, I am heartbroken for you. I would do anything to ease this loss for you, but I know it is only time that will help. My sister is bipolar and I know that sorrow. Your daughter is an angel now as you said and not feeling the pain of that awful disease. No parent should lose a child. I'm so very sorry. My prayers are with you and your family. Sue",
