      "Content": "I'm sorry that I have to disapoint all you ladies about my trip to Chicago. The only exciting things I got to do was to roll June's mother(in a wheel chire)in and out of the house for 4 1/2 weeks. The rest of the time I just watched T.V. We did get to go shopping once at Guernee Mills,Guernee and once at the big Wal-Mart in Lake Zurich, but not at the same times. Gertrude(June's mother),who got to ride in a wheel chire, was more tired after shopping than I was. June's mom was having trouble getting around by herself after spending 3 to 4 mounths in rehab learning to walk and in the hospital for fluid around her lungs. She started out unable to stand up or move on her own without someone holding her up. When we left there after four weeks, she was getting up and walking with a cane without any help. She had Physical Therapy people come out three times a week to help biuld up her arm and leg muscles. I did get to go see three movies,when Gurt was taking her afternoon naps,while I was there, \"Battleship\",\"Avengers\" and \"Snow White & the Huntsman\". So, sorry again about not having any amazing stories or tall tails to tell y'all about. Robert",

The only side affects I've experanced from either form was weight gain. I'd gained about 25 lbs. since January. As far as any dpression, my doctors have me on an anti-depressent(40mg Citalopram: generic for Celexa)for that. Matter of fact, they started me on anti-depressents from day one. Started a weight-loss program for the \"extra\" pounds and seeing a psychiatrist once a month for the depression. Hope this helps you somewhat. Robert",

Blood work came back good and physical exam showed nothing new, other than minor aches & pains cotributed to older age. My Zometa infusion went well also. No Problems Here,Y'all! After we left the doctors office at 4:30pm, we had to go to our Craven County Relay For Life Ice Cream Social at a local church at 5:30pm. My wife and I picked up our Relay T-shirts and talked with some other survivors we meet there. They were to have two speakers there,but one of them had a problem at home with a loved one, so they opened the mic for people to tell their stories about being Caregivers. So I got up to tell about when my wife was diagnoised with Kidney cancer in 2001, she would have to go to the hospital once a month,for a week of chemo. She had nurses and me waiting on her hand & foot. What ever she wanted ,she would get it. So one day,after a couple of years of this, I jokeingly said that I wanted to get cancer so I could get some attention,too. Needless to say,\"Watch out for what you wish for!\" Six years latter I was diagnoised with Breast cancer, and I still can't get anyone to wait on me \"hand & foot\"! (Laughing Out Loud) Now,I have a week to have my T-shirt stencled with \"Male Breast Cancer\" across the back before our Relay on the 27th of April. The \"Male\" is in Blue and \"Breast Cancer\" is in Pink. I also have a \"PINK\" hat with M-B-C embroidered across the front of it. Can't wait for the 27th! Anyway, just wanted to let you all know \"what's up with me\". Praying for all of you and sending (((HUGS))) your way. Robert P.S. What was with all you on that Pink Bus? There was so much cheering,shouting & partying going on, I though I saw someone whipping their blouse around over their head. I told the nurses I had no idea who those loud,noisey \"Pink\" ladies were or where they came from, because I didn't want to get kicked out before I had my infusion.( LOL )",
