      "Content": "I have had 2 MRI's, one Dec 26th, the other Jan 15th.  The first was on my Thoracic and Lumbar Spine, and Tailbone.  It showed increased cancer.  Developed a white noise kind of like a low pitch sound like the old tv tuners where they kind of wistled as well as sometimes crackling noise, they come and go.  Told onco about it, thank you Linda,  thinking I had water in my ear.  My ears were clear, hence, he ordered MRI on my brain and Cervical Spine.  Got the results Friday.  Hw was surprised, my brain is clear!  However, cervical spine/clavical is covered with cancer over nerves,and ther is increased swelling which he is pressing the nerves and causing the noise.  I was just happy I wasn't hearing voices!! (laughing) I was approved for another chemo.  Xoleda and w/oral Herceptin.  He mentioned this 2 weeks ago and I spent 2 weeks agonizing over what to do.  I know, it seems like it would be easy, yes I want to live so I will do the chemo...  but in my case it is not that easy.  After 2 years on chemo, the cancer continued to grow, spread etc...  and with the 2nd to the last chemo, I started getting UTI's over and over.  I was on 10 antibiotics in less than 9 months, as soon as they would end, within days another one.  Cultures came back positive and a lot of blood in my urine.  So I was back to the Urologist who resectioned my bladder in 2009 (they initially diagnosed me with bladder cancer,biopsy of the resection came back, 'atypical, not yet cancer)'.  He suggested a low dose of antibiotics indefinately to ward off a septic infection.  I was told my body could no longer tolerate chemo.  They stopped the chemo the first week of September.  6 weeks later, my onco offered Afinitor and I agreed.  Within 3 days I had trouble breathing.  Chest x-ray said lungs were clear so they treated me for Bronchitis=another Antibiotic, cough syrup and Steroids. chest still got tighter.  Then itchy open sores from head to toe.  I went to Rite-Aide to get cortisone cream.  The phamacist looked at my sores and asked me what meds I was now on,  told him Afinitor and he made me call my doctor on the spot.  He said it was a serious allergic reaction to the Afinitor.  The onco on call told me to stop the chemo, and either buy Benydrl and double the dose until I could get in to see my doctor, or go to ER to get a shot or IV,  I told the pharmacist about the breathing and he said I probably had the open sores in my broncial tubes as well, that I could die from it.  Within 30 hours of stopping the chemo my chest was clear and the sores were healing.  For the last 17 of the 31 days on Afinitor, I was sleeping about 20 hours a day.  My onco again stated my immune system was no longer able to tolerating chemo.  2 1/2 weeks ago when he mentioned another chemo, I was totally taken a back!  On Friday when he told me insurance approved the chemo, I asked him why the change.  If my immune system couldn't handle any more chemo 8 weeks ago, why could it now?  I asked him the chances of having the same issues or worse with this cheno?  It would be taking a chance.  I decided after talking to my onco and family, not to do more chemo at this time.  However, we will keep this as an option for the nest 90 days!  This has been such a hard decision.  One minute I would decide to do it, then I would worry about this being what does me in.  Then I would decide against it and worry that maybe this is the chemo that might stabilize or even put me in a remission.   I discussed all of this with my onco and he agreed. He was not pushing chemo on me, he was giving me an option! Both scenarios are very real possibilities (although remission would be a stretch)!  2 years of chemo has not given me the gift of remission, but we both believe that chemo or Herceptin has slowed the progress and has given me 2 more years of life!!  As far as they can tell, the growth is the same on Herceptin as it was on herceptin and chemo, but there is so many tumors that they look at the whole area and see where increased cancer is.  I have to believe that the decision that I made is the right one for me!  For the first time in 2 years, food tastes good and other than increase in pain, I feel like there is some quality to my life again!  For the pain, I agreed to increasing the dose of Fentanyl, as I have been fighting that for months!  It took a few weeks to get use to the higher dose, but I do feel some relief!  Now if only there could be a way to really make this easier on my family!   Hugs, thanks and prayers to all, Carol      ",

Mine was really fast also, from the mammogram/ultrasound (radiologist told me then it was cancer) to the Mastectomy, was less than two weeks, so it was a lot of info quickly, but not a lot of down time which was good for me. As far as telling people, that is up to you. I told close family and a few friends, but waited until I was ready for the onslaught of well wishers before I let the info out to others. It was so much easier answering questions when I knew the answers. Be prepared though. I got calls from people who I wasn't particularly close to who had lots of questions and no filters! I learned quickly to say 'I am not comfortable discussing this', and would end the conversations. I still am doing that with some. Hopefully, you will not need any of this and it will come back benign! Prayers and best wishes. Carol",

He never did call. When I went to my appointment with my oncologist, he asked me why I didn't call the on call? Told him I did, he looked at me kind of funny, so I pulled out my cell and showed him both calls. He started making excuses and I stopped him right there. I had diverticulitis with a 102 fever, that felt the same as a blockage a year before that had me GI tubed for 8 days in the hospital. Asked him what he would recommended, he said he would have sent me to the ER. Then he gave me his cell for emergency. I have never used it, but seeings that he was my mom's, mine, and my 25 year old sons oncologist, I really expected no less than a cell for emergency. Don't think either is right or wrong, what is the difference if the er called him back or you. Sounds like yours was pretty close to when he called you, er would have woke him up much later! ~Carol",

None of the female cancers have much funding for research for advanced cancer. What women get when they have stage iv is palliative care. As I was looking at so many of the clinical trials, so few were for metastatic bc, and most were funded by pharmaceuticals which made me wonder if the reason for the low funding is because of all the money that they will lose if there is a cure. I have a friend here who is a researcher and was in Montreal working on what they felt could have been a cure, and they were able to go only so far and the contract was not renewed, but she said they isolated some gene, so where does all of this leave us?",

It was amazing how effective it was. I am so sorry that you are having trouble with your insurance company dragging their feet. Keep being persistent. I have been told that many of the insurance companies are denying so many claims because only about a quarter of those that are denied are challenged even though they are legitimate claims.

Company was in middle of merger, my position was being deleted.  Needed benefits and paycheck.  Then was told 2nd day back, New position was out of state.  Oncologist was not thrilled, I drove home every Thursday evening, back Sunday night for Friday appts.   Started exercising, walking right away, then he let me build it up.  Worst part of the surgery was the drain tubes, but that was a week. My surgeon had me walking the walls right away and never had any mobility or lymphedema issues.   Main thing to make healing easier, is put what you need at easy reach for the week or so after surgery.  Drink lots of liquid to wash everything through.  Have food handy for the days following so no grocery shop.  When you are in good shape going into surgery, the healing tends to be smoother and faster.  Just don't rush everything.  Give your body the time it needs to heal! For me, I was expecting the surgery to be so much harder than it was!  Had surgery Wed. Came home Thursday, took 2 Tylenal w/codeine when I got home. Didn't need any more pain meds after that.  Hysterectomy was about an 8 out of 10 pain level, Mast. Was more like a 3-4 out 10. Hope it goes well for you. Carol    ",

He said it will not help me at all, but could help my ssons, neices and nephews, cousins and their kids.

      "Content": "mind you not because you are tired, but I keep telling people not to come because I am too tired, but really I don't always have the energy to vacuum or cook. Sometimes I will tell them to call when they get here and I go out to their car. I thought I was the only one! A couple of months ago a good friend called and wanted to stop, I finally told her I hadn't vacuumed in 2 days and was too tired to, so if she wanted to come, not to wear black (I have a pug and boxer), (otherwise the house is clean, kitchen is always good to cook, and dogs don't go in the bedrooms). Now, she just stops without calling like she used to, and she has no problem if she see's I need help with something, she just helps. A couple of others have started this too. At first I was embarrassed, but not any more. I am glad for their company and they knew before all of this my house was always clean! I also will be sitting on my couch talking to people and the next thing I know it is the middle of the night and I am sound asleep with a blanket over me, or my son will come home and wake me to go to bed. The last I remember is visiting with people. They also know that when I tell them I am going to sleep or nap, not to come. I don't hear the doorbell or knocking, and they do respect my wishes. It took a while for some to realize that this is not like being tired because I didn't get a full 8 hours, this is a bone tired. When I first got sick, some ladies from work could not figure out how I could feel ok to go to lunch on Tuesday with so/so and not with them on Friday. Tried to explain, when I can I do, when I can't I don't!",

The marriage ran its course and as hard as it was we have both made satisfying lives for ourselves that we couldn't do together. Good luck to both of you. Life is way to short.

      "Content": "Mid August got a letter from SSDI that I was being re-evaluated for continuation of benefits, and they didnt get paperwork from the blood monitoring team (blood clots). They got it from the cancer center, but not from the Univ of Utah Hospital. Phone call followed that this could stop the payments if it is not received, this was around the 15th of Aug. 2 weeks ago I vot a letter saying they would reevaluate 8/17 There was a box ckd that said I would need to do a 9 month trial work period, and another box ckd staing that the doc who determined disability said condition waz improved. Followed by about 8 pages on getting retrained, how to do the 9month trial period, and pages regarding the appeal process. This was Friday eve when I read it. I panicked. Called Gagee, who laughed. The first paragraph said it was continuing , the 8/17 date was referring to 8 of 2017. There was an IF that I missed. GAGEE was laughing bcuz she went thru the same thing a few years ago. I was so wigged when I called her and thankfully, I didnt have to go the whole weekend. When I talked to Medicare, asked why it was so confusing? I asked if I would have looked for a job and worked, thinking I was following their directions, would that have messed up my SSDI? She said yes if I wouldnt have reported it! It could have resulted in me losing my SSDI. Moving on... Lastyear, I had a mix up w/company benefits and Medi are part B. Co. Said I didnt need part B as they weremy primary ins. This would be the case normally, but I worked for the phone company, and my long term medical was a contracted Cobra plan. The company was in the process of being taken over by CenturyLi k which wasin southern states and was not union. The rep that was asaigned to my longtem disability benefits was not aware, I had never been on long-term disability so I didnt know, and the medicare reps gave me a different answer with each phone call. Fi ally got that all taken care of. I needed Medicare pary A&B, my company would continue my medical (as a supplement), life ins., and a disability ck. I would continue paying the premiums on the medical and life ins until 2022, or my 65th birthday. It is in writing. On Tuesday of this week, I received a letter from my benifits that my lice ins ends October 3@, 2015. I called our benefits dept. was told that is correct, the letter from last year was an error. The new rep had made a mistake. They gave me the number and caze number for met life. I was able to sit down with the rep Wednezday, took my son with me. I waz told by my old employer that it would be the zame pri e. By law theyare requireed to let me keep the policy even with pre-existing which is gfeat. Because I am si k, have been diagnosed and freted for a hroni or ferminal illness in ghe last 5 yeats, it is not the same price. The premiums jumped fdom 115. A month to $435.",

If insurance is an issue, they may have connections for programs that work on a scale or may be able to get insurance to cover treatment due to the affects of alcohol and cancer. I wish you the best. I have a brother kind of in the same boat, except he doesn't want to quit now or do tx, but a few weeks ago he did. He was able to find a program though the University Medical center, but then decided against it. I realize how hard it is, and I just think that the best way to find out what is available in the area may be your oncologist and hopefully he/she would do everything they could to help you with this. I would also call your local chapter of the American Cancer Society. It is amazing how many programs there are for us that we don't hear about unless we specifically ask. Prayers and the best to you.

She said it was overkill, i would never get it back.  8 years later, i was stage iv.

The areas where the tumors are the worst had pockets of water that by the end of the day were putting so much pressure on my lower back that I had to up pain meds just to function. That seems to be somewhat better now, and I am drinking so much water and eating fruits and veges that should have a positive effect (all anti inflammatory).

      "Content": "Hi everyone.  Thought it was time for an update.  The radiation to the brain was the hardest, mainly due to the steroids and the radiation itself.  I have had whole body cramping since 2 days after starting the steroids, we lowered the dose, but can't stop it as it is keeping the swelling down.   Like finished the rads 20 days ago, had scans last Thursday, both a whole body scan and CT scans from throat to pelvic.  Will get the results Friday, which is an 8 day wait, then hopefully I will be weaned don't and off the steroids.  I am usually up by midnight and walking off cramping until 5-6 am.   Have taken extra ativan, zanex, potassium, magnesiun, and calcium.  It is the one steroid that works on the brain so I will continue as the side effects not taking a higher dose scared the living s*** out of me when it was cut back and I got a sudden headache and no vision for 3 hours in my right eye. I took the steroid that we cut out, and it did whatever it was suppose to do cause I could see again! Lol The radio tech doing my scan and nurse who accessed my port asked me where the pain was, it was the lower right side of the back of my head and it was swollen, I guess the swelling put pressure on the optic nerve.  So....   I have kept busy, it has slowed me down but not stopped me.  The scans were done to see the progression.  My oncology feels that the cancer is aggressive enough that it made it through the skull, linings, and into brain, which makes him believe that the other tumors throughout my body are most likely just as aggressive, so we will see.   I did the Suvivors to the Summit 2 weeks ago with The Cancer Wellness House, where you either hike other take the tram to the top of Snowbird Ski Resort, which as usual was an amazing event, and I took the tram.  Most activity from 8a-noon was at 8000 ft.  When I got to the top, I could not keep my balance 11,000 ft, so I missed a lot of the celebration but was thrilled that I was able to partcipate, and I do a 50/50 raffle which my goal was $1000, and surpassed it (This is a big fund raiser for the Wellness House).  Most thought I was so nuts when I said my goal, but we were ecstatic as the raffle tickets were $4.  My sister in law and I started it last year and almost doubled it.   I will know more by the weekend but don't know if I care to hear the results as so much of what's I have been dealing with is like a stroke, the headaches, balance, drooling, can't remember things, and trouble when I get tired forming sentences.  But still feel so blessed to even be here much less still being so active.   I may go to Park City next week to do a zip line at the 2002 Olympic Village which I saw for the first time last week.  They have a short one that accommodates all abilities.  One thing I have always wanted to do. One other thing, on July 25th we had fireworks here for Pioneer Day, celebrating the Mormon missionaries trek to Salt Lake.  They were only being done at one park here that day.  We took a gal who is 27 5 kids who has stage 4 cancer, her 10 year old who was visiting her had never seen real fireworks.  A lady walking behind us we moaning everyone was taking to long walking behind me pushing a big stroller, and dragging 2 more behind her said to her sister, I am just going, she rimmed the stroller into the back of my legs, I flew into a man ahead of me then straight down on my left ribs (3 fractured), rolled the stroller over my right foot.  The man asked if it was the bioch with the stroller, I said yes, he said she ran it into his 3 year old grandson right before that.  He started after her, I asked him to help me up, he tried by lifting on the ribs, I kind of yelled stop, then told him I needed his arm to balance and get up as people were almost walking on me, just as I got up, and a cop came who was going after her for battery, guess shots rang out, a little gang thing about 40 feet away.  This has been the weirdest month of my life. So 2 days later, a friend and I took a two night getaway to Nevada!  I sometimes think seeing humor in the weirdest places has kept me here all this time. Will let you know when I hear more Hugs and Prayers, Carol  ",

In Jan I went to primary doc for bron hitis and asked him to feel the lump, it hadnt gotten bigger, but it didnt go away like the first on. He looked at it, felt it and left the rrom. Came back within 5min and said I had an appt at 9a the ne t am. said he didnt like the way it felt. He said it was not a good lump. So at 11a next morn I had the mamo and US. called in the rad Dr from the U. He said 99.9% sure it was cancer, you need to find a surgeon! I waited 4 months bcuz I was told to. How was I to know the difference. So Glo, that is my reason.... did that time make a difference? I will never know.",

My body didn't tolerate it. August 2010, I had pain in my ribs/chest, went to er, had a ct scan, was told a pulled muscle. 2 weeks later had horrible pain in my pelvic region and lower back. I called my oncologist, he saw me the next day, I had a pet the following Wednesday. It lit up like a Christmas tree. Then a bone biopsy to my left hip. Positive for IDC. Biopsy on a lump under the skin in my back, positive for IDC. Started rads to my pelvic, tailbone, hips and lower spine. Started chemo in January 2011, and am now on my 3rd chemo and he added Herceptin as the other 2 chemo's didn't touch the tumors, and I was borderline her2+. I have been on weekly chemo for over a year, and a ct scan showed it is now in the soft connective tissue in my ribs, as well as lesions on my liver. Just had new scans to see if the third chemo did anything. For the first time since all of this started, I have no new tumors! Some tumors showed increased activity, some showed decreased activity, and some that are stable. I will stay on this chemo as long as it works. Then we will find another one At first, due to rapid growth I was given about 3-6 months, it is now 18. I still drive, walk, and enjoy every day that I am feeling good, and try to find good even in the days that suck! I do weekly chemo, so I have usually 2-3 good days, and try to make the others tolerable, if not, I go to sleep. This journey has not been easy, but when I was dx w/mets, it was already in most of my bones and skin. Was tired from not sleeping. I couldn't get comfortable. As long as my liver functions are good, I will not worry about them. I am tired but am able to nap when it gets bad. Cancer sucks, and stage iv is not an immediate death sentence. I have watched both my boys graduate from college, have been to California twice to see my family. I am now taking a ceramics class to stay sane and be social. You have come to the right site, these pinks are awesome and really do care. I can't tell you the difference it has made in my life. I have wonderful sisters and friends, but unless they have been there, they don't relate to most of my everyday life. Hugs and Prayers on your journey, Carol",

Pain Dr said it won't get better and it will take about a month for se to go away when they are this bad. Onco says should go away in 5-6 days, I tend to believe the pain doctor. Right leg is still 2x the size of left, from rad tattoo on calf to hip. Both say lymphedema and suggest a stocking during the day, cant even reach feet to put on socks. Will see what the le specialist says and will have to have someone come to put it on in the am. Was on Cipro for IUD, that threw off the coumadin levels, bouncing between 1.5 and 4.1, now testing 2x a week. Says there is no real science will need to keep changing dosage until we get it back to 2 -2.5. He says have to really watch for internal bleeding and blood clots, said it will help with clots but no guarantee that I won't get more as blood clots can come from the cancer, anti-hormonal meds, as well as inactivity. Was told to exercise, but keep off my feet because of the swelling, so I exercise laying in bed. Started Oxygen. Can't tell if it has made a difference. I am too worn out from fighting the pain. Trying so hard to be active, but honestly the only time I even feel good is when I am sleeping. I wake up happy, then try to get up and it all starts again. I keep trying to find community activities that may spark enough interest that makes me want to get up. I am working so hard trying to stay up! But honestly feel I am losing that battle too. He tried to get me in a Acupuncture trial, but I do not qualify because I am stage IV. He said research has come so far, I said not for stage iv! I explained the numbers, how less than 3% of the monies is going to stage iv research. He was surprised so I gave him some sites. ie. Metavivor.com He does research and comes from NIH. I asked him if he would help me find a trial. Currently there are none at this cancer hospital/center for stage iv. I agree overall there is a lot of recognition and trials for stage 1 - 3, but not so much for stage iv. This past year was a little higher, because money was committed prior to grants being cut. He cant find anything that I qualify for.",

Dr. would not chg to Arimadex bcuz it is thr brother to Femara and he felt the s/e would be the same or worse. So it was Aromason. I refused to start it for a month after stopping the Femara. Figured I wouldnt be able to tell if it was se from Aromason or still the Femara. I have been on Aromason for a year now and only se has been some dry mouth. My tumor Markers have gone from 500+ to 25 las week, so it is stabalizing the cancer. I am hoping that I get more years, actually I feel like I am on borrowed time for 4 years. I was told 3-6 months at onset of mets, didnt have mch good newsnwith chemo, biophosphatesnran theirmcourse, blood clots limited ither options so, I am thrilled with getting this time and keep praying that I get more time out of Aromason.

I no longer eat when I get home. I wait a few hours then have an iced drink, usually water, and move as little as possible for a few hours. Once the Decadron kicks in, sleep is not in the immediate fiture, It can be anywhere from 6 hours to 35 hours before I can sleep and I am wired but not sick until I get so exhausted, but the zofran in the morning and night wort alonf with the ativan. Best for me is I only eat what I am hungry for and only eat a little at a time. For some reason it seems to work. Keep us posted on how you are doing. Doris I will keep you in my prayers. You have every riht to not be strong all the time. This is not an easy disease and we have to allow ourselves days that we feel this way. bI hope it gets better. Doris, you cant be strong all the time, give youself pemisson to have some shi**y days. And do whatever it takes to get throuh them. You and your doc will find something that woks. Hugs, Carol",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy and went with implants. They were not right. First time, woke up in the morning and the right side (mastectomy side), was flat. Couldn't find the implant. Cracked me up. Called the PS, went in. He couldn't find it either. Assumed it popped! A week later he went back in. I was sporting my new boob in my armpit and back! Removed it. He placed a new one. 3 days later, went in took off the bandages, it was half the size of the left one. Rescheduled for a month later (fda was releasing a new implant for bc), had this one put in. It is better, have had it for 10 years in November, still not perfect, smaller than the left, but with a bra it is not so noticeable. Then had the nip done, it flattened back out in 6 weeks so just had more scars, no nip. It was quite a trip. Then went and had the whole breast tatoo'd, now when I get out of the shower I look at a beautiful hibiscus and hummingbird! Can you go back to the Plastic Surgeon? He should be able to make some minor adjustments that will improve the look and feel. Others who had the flap have said that it took close to a year for it to get to where it was going to be. But if you are not happy with it, I would go and get it fixed! Don't worry about complaining, our breasts are the reason for this journey, and we are here to support you! Vent anytime. Get back to the PS! Best of luck to you. Carol",

Only bad thing, was having to go in and get it.  Easiest treatment other than Aromasin for me. Wish you the best.",

I am going to have to ask why? I don't know about longer than a year, so far I have only been on each of the chemo's for 3-4 months weekly now, and the rest were 3x a month and the bone shot on the 4th week. I will have to ask some questions on Wednesday. Carol",

Normally I do take a Xanax, but didnt need it with the open air one. I could see the ouside (floor to ceiling windows on the one side). Only way to go! That last one was the only time I ever got hot like that! Try an open one if they are available.",

I hope you can leave all of what you have to look forward to when you get home, at home for the rest of your trip, it certainly isn't going anywhere. I think we do get your roller coaster ride. Enjoy this trip in spite of your geriatric co-passengers, they just dont have any idea how amazing you really are. I dont hink you are at all ungrateful. You have been dealt a pretty rough hand at a really ypung age and I am truly amazed at how well you are doing wih it. If you are doing a little hobbling along at times it means that you are most likely not pain free either. I hope the rest of your trip is amazing and you get to see and do as much as possible! Cant wait to hear all about the highlights of your trip and all the places you have been! Hugs and prayers, Carol",
