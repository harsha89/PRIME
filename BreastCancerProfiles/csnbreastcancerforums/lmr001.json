    "Content": "I had TC and herceptin and experienced problems with my mouth... My tongue would turn completely white and the inside of my mouth was very tender. Thrush is name of the problem. In any case, what worked for me was plain greek yogurt... I would hold it on my tongue for a few seconds then swallow. I like yogurt so it was no problem. The probiotics in the yogurt are supposed to help with your digestive system too. I was on medication for it also... some kind of anti fungal med. It would come right after a chemo treatment... it was bad for a few days... and then it would disappear over night after 4-5 days.",
