    "Content": "My sister was diagnosed with Breast Cancer 5 1/2 years ago, she went through a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. 2 1/2 years ago, they found cancer on her ovary and in her blood stream. She knew then that she was in a fight because of the cancer being in her blood stream, it was in remission for a couple of years. She is now dying at the age of 46, (her bd is Dec 11 and she will be 47) because the cancer is now in her liver and colon. She is in a lot of pain and hospice has been slowly increasing her pain medication as needed. My sister started planning her funeral arrangements when she was dx with the cancer in the blood stream. She has everything taken care of, she said that she did not want my nieces who are in their 20's to have to do this. She has even planned what she will be buried in. She has made her wishes know to everyone so that they will be carried out the way she wants them to be. I live in Texas and my sister lives in Illinois. I went to visit her in October at the suggestion of my oncologist, she said that I should visit while she was still feeling pretty good or I would regret it later.",
