    "Content": "Dear Friends; My Mom passed away the 10th after I had to watch her die from dehydration because she could no longer swallow from the alzheimers, and she didn't want tubes, etc.. I started losing my hair,(and my mind),the same day. I finally had a friend shave my head yesterday, just in time for my second cycle of chemo tomorrow. I am not feeling very pretty right now and definately not looking forward to the chemo. It is hard to be upbeat when you feel life is beating you up. Coming here helps a lot. Thanks to all the gals who are looking out for me here. God Bless You! I hope I can also help others here as they need comfort. ~ Milly",
