    "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here.  I'm 3 weeks post BMX, no reconstruction.  I've been having pain in my chest wall that feels similar to a the pain of a sunburn.  There's no aching, it's more of a burning, diffuse pain.  Has anyone else experienced this?  How long was it a problem for you? Thanks for any input you can give me. Dianna",
