      "Content": "I will be starting Taxol the 28th, plus perjeta and herceptin, of course.  I'll be doing it for 15 weeks, onco had said 12, but now it's 15.  No neulasta for some reason (she started out saying that but changed to none).  I did the taxoterene the 7th and was allergic to it, what a nightmare that was.  Anyway, any advice to ward off as many side effects as is possible would be greatly appreciated.  I drink a lot of water, I found that helped with the taxoterene.  Everyone on here who has been giving me advice have been just great and have helped ALOT.  Thanks all!",

      "Content": "I don't have mine numbed when being accessed, and I just feel a little stick, not uncomfortable, more like a sensation.  I wouldn't do chemo any other way and it does make it easier for blood draws and testing.  I have gotten used to it being there after just a few months.  Not uncomfortable for sleeping either.  Good luck!",
