      "Content": "The chemo is to go after any stray cancer cells that may have found their way to another part of your body via the lymph system. When you see your onco take a list of questions you want answered and take a friend as well if possible. You may get more information than you can digest and having someone else there to compare notes with later is a big plus. Or you can take a tape recorder and play back the info at your leisure. If you chemo is going to be for more than a few months, ask about a port. It is a small disc inserted under the skin in your shoulder which accepts the chemo via injection and is much more comfortable than multiple needle sticks into veins in arms or other locations. Ask a lot of questions about the possible side effects of which ever drugs your onco is planning on using, and also explore with him/her the available medications to control any side effects you might have. Sometimes our oncos won't bring up side effects, thinking they will scare us perhaps, or afraid too much information might 'predispose' us to react in some particular way. But my opinion is that it is wiser to be informed and know what to watch for and what to do in case any side effects do occur. Good luck and God bless.",

      "Content": "My ex divorced me after my 3rd cancer dx over a span of 10 yrs. He also (via his lawyer) made ridiculous demands, even asking for a portion of my inheritance from my parents, which I did not have yet because they were still living! It is just a way of muddying the waters when a lawyer thinks (or knows) he had a weak case. I ended up with: Half our assets (house was ordered sold by the court), him having to continue to supply me with medical insurance AND pay whatever medical costs I had that were not covered by the policy (I had been a stay-at-home wife and mother for 28 years - was 48 with no job skills or work history - and disabled by the cancer and treatments), AND I got half of the retirement he had built up during the 28 years we were married. Also alimony and child support. Also got full custody of our minor child because ex was not being a good moral example for the 11 year old. I can't promise that you will get the same justice I did, but if you can find a lawyer that will remain reasonable in what he asks for in your behalf and strong in protesting the ridiculous demands of the other side, your soon-to-be ex will come off looking like a prize idiot to the court. No judge smart enough to sit the bench is fooled by bullying.",

It needs to be managed carefully so that it does not become a permanent health issue. I became so weak after my first 10-month rounds of chemo that I was literally ill from fatigue and my onco was telling me there was nothing wrong with me. Fatigue doesn't show up in blood work or on scans, but it is real and must be respected and treated like any other phase of our disease. Just try cutting corners wherever you can, shorter work days, 10 minute exercise programs instead of 30 minute ones, etc. And ask for help more than you have ever done before with the necessary-to-life daily chores. There is no shame in being less than 100% efficient all the time. With some time and tlc your body, mind, and spirit will regain a lot of its former oomph and the aches and pains will become less of an issue.",

The 'sealant' they used acted like a bandage without having to be treated like one. It is gone now and my port is just a bump in the road to recovery. You can see it when I am undressed of course, but only me and one lucky guy ever does so....   ;) Like the other ladies said, wear open neck shirts on treatment days.

But, if you need to call your doctor and say, 'hey, time for some help here', just do it. There are several meds available for stress and anxiety. One will work for you if you need to go that route. And, don't forget, that you were moving about your day with a smile at one point while others were going through this, so the cards have just been re-shuffled. It is life after all. Concentrate on doing what has to be done to get back to the 'walking with a smile' kind of days in your life. God bless.",
