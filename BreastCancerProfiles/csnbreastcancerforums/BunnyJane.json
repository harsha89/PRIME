Like you, I can't believe how much better I feel. I saw the surgeon yesterday and she confirmed that exercise will accelerate the healing process and will improve long-term survival rates! Time to get the sneakers on! Jane",

      "Content": "I am half way through TC treatments (every three weeks) and a friend (who just completed chemo for ovarian ca) recommended accupucture. She indicated that the accupunture treatments helped her manage pain, focus on healing, and rid herself of negative thoughts. I talked to my onc. about it and she said that I could have accupunture on my 'good' week (week before treatments), but not during the two weeks following treatments, due to infection risk. I also practice yoga, another complementary therapy. I have an accupuncture appt. in a few weeks and will let you all know how it goes. Namaste- Jane",

My MD gave me pre-meds (steroids) and several anti-nausea drugs in my IV. The day of and day after treatment tend to be pretty easy, but days 3 through 5 are kind of rough, mostly due to fatigue and pain. I've used Tylenol to manage pain. It is very important to drink lots of water during and after your treatments!",

My MD indicated that most local recurrences of my kind of BC occur within the first 2 years, so I decided that I would wait at least 2 years before making any decision regarding reconstruction. I have no regrets at this point. Good luck with your surgery and healing. Jane",
