      "Content": "I'm sorry you are in such pain. I too have used the diaper rash meds, they seem to help. Would not recommend that you soak in a tub though, especially if you have a yeast infection. Nothing new to add, but letting the area get some air is a good thing. I wish you lots of luck, just be patient, this will pass. Hang in there! Hugs, Cheyenne",

      "Content": "I am 35 now, I had my first mammo at age 32. My breasts are very lumpy, and it was important to watch it. I had a biopsy when I was 32, because I had a large lump, but it turned out to be a cyst. When I was dx at the end of July, 2009, the tumor was in the same spot that the cyst had been in. I have no family history of breast cancer. My sister called her doctor to schedule a mammo last week, but because of her age, they refused! She is 28. I told her to switch doctors. I feel that women should have mammos at 30 or 35, not 40. It needs to be done earlier. Early detection is so important. My daughter is only 8 now, but I am going to insist that she be tested early on.",
