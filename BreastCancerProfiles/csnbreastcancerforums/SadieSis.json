    "Content": "I confirmed with my dr that HER2 does not trigger the cancer, but it is a protein in the cancerous cell that makes the existing cancer grow rapidly. HER2 is ONLY in the cancerous cells. Herceptin clings to the HER2 protein, makes it retreat back into the cell which in turn makes the bad cell starve/die off. Therefore, all the healthy cells in your body are left alone. It's nice to finally find someone else who is HER2+. I was beginning to think that it was so terminal that no one is left to talk about it! I'm just past my 1st 2 AC treatments, then I get 12 wks of Taxol with Herceptin, then 1 yr of Herceptin. How did you fare during the Taxol treatment. That one has me scared.",
