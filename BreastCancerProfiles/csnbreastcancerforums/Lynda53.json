      "Content": "and hope the new center will be better. I was asked about insurance in January as so mnay change the 1st of the year (I did) thanks for the advice about asking for records I will do that. I had 1 issue with being told that I had to get my mammos, crap I said, you had them, called my onco and he took care of that. All my info is on the pc, every Dr, it is awesome, esp w/heart issueseven my meds, hen asked, isay check my file for jan 3oth under dr Smith, they were updated then. Yes I am asked my DOB for everything including food trays but it is important that everything is checked 2x and 3x do that it goes to who it is for. The one time, I ws not asked before a heart proc, the RN was about to give me aspirin, when I said no,she persisted that I had to have it,when told to call my onco or approval,she backed off(one of my drugs interacts poorly w/aspirin, Onco had said \"UNLESS THEY JUMP UP & DOWN NO ASPIRIN!\" I am also on coumadin, dope, no aspirin, my blood gets any thinner I'll be leaking. So obv this facility did not read all my charts. They are all clearly noted as files, MEDS, Allergies etc. good luck Peace",

      "Content": "Your heart is tested if there could be issues. TAC is most common but not always are all 3 given. I do not have (The A)doxorubicin, which was originally called Adriamycin due to heart issues. Don't want the clicker quitting on me right now! I also was taken off all due to taxotere(taxol) reactions (not breathing is not good!) The T shrinks the beast Usually 4-6 cycles are given, ASK Different doses are also used, as are iv's and pills So I have the C (cyclophosphamide,also used for rheumatoid arthritis!) and aromasin (old lady drug)for now Write down your questions and concerns and ask them all Peace",

      "Content": "I am far from sayng it is the cure all for chemo rections. IF they can figure what chemo drug is making you so sick, there is a process done at some hospitals called desensitization. It is also used for diabetics who are allergic to the insulin. Basicaly, same drugs, just \"watered\" down and administered. It only takes once and your body is all set for whatever more they need to give. No clue if this is the case,if you want more info email me Peace",
