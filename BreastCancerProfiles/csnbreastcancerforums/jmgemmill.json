A week after my surgery I had a similar thing happen, spiked a fever, and my arm swelled to several times its size. My doctor gives me a prescription to have on hand, it always seems to always happen on a weekend. My doctors cautioned me about insect bites, scratches and fingernail care - watch the cuticle. Don't wait until Monday, try to call your doctor now. Good Luck - jmgemmill",
