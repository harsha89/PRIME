I have always felt that if you have a lump in your breast that seems out of the ordinary, get a biopsy to check it out. They can do a needle aspiration even in the office to take some fluid from it to see if it might be cancer. Or, even do a core needle biopsy. It is worth it to catch bc early. I hope you don't have to do chemo, but, if you do, you have a group here to support you thru your treatment. Good luck to you! Lex♥",

I also never commented on the post that went too far. It was like my dog is bigger than your dog child game. I admit, I hate caps too unless they are in a post where someone wants to make a point with that word. Most only use caps in the title to a thread once, not all of the time. It is like yelling or trying to really get attention. Let's just use the site for what it is meant for and be grown up about it. I think 99% of the time it is. So, let's all have a huge cyber hug and continue in our fight with the beast. Lex♥ p.s. do you think tinkerbell will ever get through that keyhole? LOL",

Heck, I read my own, thru help on the internet. There is a test to see if you metabolize Tamoxifen. It is called cyp2D6 and it checks your dna to see if you metabolize it. From what I understand, if you don't, there is no sense in taking it. And, I wouldn't take any further treatment until I got answers to my questions.

You shouldn't have to be worrying if your husband is off with some other girl, should you? Moving to NY to be close to your family sounds great.
