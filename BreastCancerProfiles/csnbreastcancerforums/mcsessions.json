    "Content": "My mom had a radical mastectomy and had NO PAIN at all, she was moving and lifting her arm hours after surgery, she got 21 nodes removed and spent 2 nights at the hospital. She also complained about the drains being a little uncomfortable but manageable. I bought her a beautiful camisole to wear post surgery that came with two pockets to hold the drains, these pockets have some velcro on them so they can be adhered to the interior side of the blouse that way you can also hide them. You can find it in a mastectomy boutique or you can make them yourself it's the simplest thing but very useful. She later found that she could adhere the pockets to all of clothes like sweats and underwear. Hope this helps.",
