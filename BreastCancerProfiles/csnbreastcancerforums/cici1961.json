    "Content": "Hey there, I just had my first round of Chemo yesterday after having a masectomy on my right side. The lymph nodes were negative but my doctor recommended Chemo as a precaution so that if any cancer cells did slip out, the Chemo should kill them. I agreed wholeheartedly. I would rather go through Chemo and hopefully never have to go through this again. I figured my doctor knew more than I did. I am not looking forward to losing my hair, but it will be worth it in the end. Good luck, my thoughts are with you!",
