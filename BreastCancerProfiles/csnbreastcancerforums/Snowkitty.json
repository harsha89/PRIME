Now, my nose hair just sprung up, and it's longer than my head hair. Arm pit hair is there too. Those 3 chin hairs have had babies. My face is fuzzy. Help....I'm turning into a short-haired gorilla! But, all is good. Cindy",

I had my mind set that I would have a BMX, since I already had HR/PR+ in the left girl in 2010.  This was triple- in righty.  I thought, nuts, might as well get both of them off, so this wouldn't happen again. My surgeon, however, had a different idea. He was insistant on a lumpectomy in righty, since it went way down from a golf ball to marble (aprox).  So I don't know what to think.  I am releaved not to have a BMX, but don't know if that's the right thing for me.  However, I don't want to cut off a hand for a hangnail. So, surgery, then rads. Cindy",

Once in a while I noticed it was in my field of view. O well, then stupid CA came along and I figured I would wait to get it removed. Then, sometime after 2nd chemo, I noticed it was...gone! Yeah me. Chemo did something for me. So, I mentioned this to my onc today and did her eyes pop open. She said if you ever get another one, get it removed immediately. It's a bad one that it responded to chemo. Just so ya know. Cindy",

Got 3 pinpoint tats, one between the girls and one on each side of my trunk. Everyday they re-draw cross hatches on them and make sure the lasers are marking the spot correctly. My magic number is 95.5 which is the radio station I listen to. (had no mold) Then this big machine starts at my left, and I could when rads are happening. Then it goes to my right and I can see the pins going into position, and count again. The only problem is, when my arms are up in the armrests, head turned to the side, I have itches on my face all over. You can't move to scratch them. Rads are not bad at all. Take care, cindy",

One nurse told me to drink 2-3 liters of liquid a day. I was never given a specific amount to drink.  That's a hell of a lot.  What a difference that made.  Started the day of chemo, and didn't let up on drinking that amount for probably 10 days.  Didn't have to wear diapers, but did have to wear pads, I had to pee so much. Drinks of choice:  flavored teas, pinapple juice, grape juice, fruit punch. Please don't give up. Take care, Cindy",
