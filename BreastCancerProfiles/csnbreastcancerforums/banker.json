Yes they will do tests, bloodwork will continue ( mine was monthly for 3 month), my onc. did chest xray , bonescan and CT scan of pelvic area. Visits to the onc. are on a 3 month basis for the 1st year , then 4 mo, then 6 mo. Lots of bloodwork inbetween incl. the CA 27.29 bloodtest. I am sure your doctor will do the same. I had a mastectomy in 1998,6 mo chemo, reconstruction (TRAM FLAP)in 1999, a new BC in the other breast last year in Feb., Lumpectomy, Rads and 6 mo chemo again. I am fine. Both my cancers were ER neg. I am 59 but who is counting?? You are doing great, hope I have answered your questions and helped a little, if you would like to email me my address is charmin@froggernet.com Take care, god bless you, love Emmi",

      "Content": "Hi KarenRose, welcome, glad you are doing well. At present I am going through chemo and I just went back to work part time. My chemo protocol is called CMF, 28 day cycle. I get chemo twice a month. Before they start ,I get an IV with Zofran (an anti nausea medication) and Decadron (steroid) also for nausea. This combination has helped me.I also take a Zofran pill 8 mg before I leave the clinic where I get my treatment and again 1 pill 12 hrs later. I get very tired after the treatment,headaches and some body aches, everybody is different and reacts different. My hair is thinning and I will shave it off soon. When I had chemo 3 1/2 yrs ago I had Adriamycin, all my hair came out after 10 days , depending on the meds , all have different side effects. Its a rough road, we all have been there, You too will get through this. At present I feel great, my next chemo is 7-11 and 7-18, I also have to give myself shots to get my blood count up. My Doc. is 2 hrs away, that's why I do the shots. So thereare good days and some bad once. But we have to deal with it. Think positive, if you have questions, just ask. God bless you... Love Emmi",

Somtimes I get the feeling from the people at work (I am off right now) they think I am having a great time beeing off. They only see me on my good days, not when I am sick right after chemo. I had one good weekend since my 1st chemo in May,I was sooooo happy and told them,so they figure I have a wonderful time. Yeah, I guess they expect me to just sit around and feel sorry for myself.???? I have decided not to stop in at work anymore. Now my Onc. has put me on antibiotics Cipro and Amoxicillin and daily shots of Neupogen to get my bloodcount up for chemo on Thurs. I give the shots myself cause my Onc. lives in the city 2 hrs away. So far so good. Sure glad I have a understanding husband who has been there for me. When I had chemo 3 1/2 years ago I did not need shots, so all of this I think is getting to me. Glad you girls are good listeners, had to talk to somebody. I think I will enjoy the day, the sun is shining the birds are singing and I think I feel better already. God bless you all. Thanks for listening. Love Emmi",

We all face reality but a little tact is always welcome. I would mention it to my doctor if I were you. I have just been diagnosed again with BC. It did not come back,it is a new cancer in the other breast which is again different. So I say the heck with all the statistics, cause acording to them I should not even have BC. Like you I deal with it one day at a time. Hang in there, God bless you, I will keep you in my prayers. Emmi",
