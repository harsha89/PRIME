    "Content": "I have stage one BC. Her2+, ER+, PR+. Node negative. I feel good and have a good prognosis for survival. I want to take supplements that will really help reduce my risk of reoccurrence. The trouble is I hate taking medicine and I often forget. Currently I am taking a multi vitamin, calcium with D, fish oil, vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium. I also add fresh milled flax seed to my breakfast. I am organically growing my own broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, peppers, carrots, lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, cantaloupe, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. I eat red meat only once every other week. I eat a lot of fish. I eat beans now instead of white potatoes. I avoid sugar, omega 6 fats, white flours and processed foods. I joined a gym and brisk walk for 30 minutes on the days I do not go to the gym. Is there more that you all are doing that you really believe in.???",
