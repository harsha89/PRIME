    "Content": "Oh, Kathi. I must have sensed something was up. Yesterday I was thinking of you and Hans and telling myself I needed to send you a pm to see how things were going. I was thinking about when you were taking care of Hans and things were difficult. It seemed like things had gotten so much better. I'm so sorry. Even if it really, really is the best thing in the world for both of you, it hurts. You've been together a long time and have been through so much together.. Please message me if you need/want to. *hugs* Gail",
