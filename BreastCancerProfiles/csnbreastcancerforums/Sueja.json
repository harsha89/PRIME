    "Content": "I had a double mastectomy on Dec. 5 2007, my plastic surgery put in expanders, the right expander flipped so he had to stop filling the expanders. On May 8, 2008 I had the expanders taken out and implants put in, during the operation the doctor found cloudy fluid and set it to be cultured and found it to be a fungus. My plastic surgeron set me to see a Infectious Disease doctor who put me on Fluconazole 200mg twice a day. I was fine the over the weekend I started to feel nasusa and dizzy. I been vomiting but not a lot, I called the doctor but he said it was not the medicine. I am suppose to be on this medicine for 2 months. Has anybody else been on this medicine? Please Help I am really confused and fell a little helpless.",
