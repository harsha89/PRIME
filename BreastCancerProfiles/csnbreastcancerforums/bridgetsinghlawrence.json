    "Content": "plz friends pray for my mothers healing,doctors say she has breast cancer,i beg u all to pray for my mothers pain and the big tumour she is having on her left breast.. plz pray she may be healed this moment,,i need her life. 30th September 2011 _______________________________ Thank u very much for ur prayers my dear friends, My dear friends,yesterday we got the report of PET SCAN of whole body,for which doctors had prescribed us to do,to see whether cancer has spread to another part of the body or not. So we got the report and i really felt like crying when i heard that by seeing the scanned reports they again suspect that it has spread to the spinal cords left vertebrae.. as we can clearly see the dark black spots.. So yesterday evening we did MRI test of my mother's spinal cord,which will reveal the final report today.. Please my dear brothers and sisters i beg u again to pray for my mothers report that it should come normal..otherwise doctor wont do operation of breast cancer coz they say operation cant be done if the disease has spread to bones.and she will suffer with the pain till her last breath.. i m really broken ,i m only child of my parents.i live in india.. my father does not love my mother as he is busy with his life.he has left her,he doesnt care about her,this situation is making my mother really weak..plz pray for my mothers life,and the test report . i know and believe if u all will pray for my mother from ur true heart,my mother will see a miracle in her life,and she will be healed soon.",
