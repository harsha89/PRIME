      "Content": "Dear Alane - The liver responds very quickly to the body & can show these high results. My oncologist said that it can mean either a lot of damage or a lot of healing going on. Unless other factors back it up he just watches them. Also pain killers containing paracetmol can do a lot of damage to the liver in large doses (more than 8 per day). Sounds like a case of a poorly communicating onco to me. If mine goes away he leaves contact details for a locum & even phoned from vacation in Wales to the locum here in New Zealand (where I live) when I had a bad reaction to a drug being used. You have to be a bit pushy with these docs to get the information you need. Remember it's your body & your life so get pushy. Hang on in there. I am holding your hand in the bad moments & the good. Pam from New Zealand.",

But hey I have had 20 very very good years totally symptom free so I am very grateful for my life & in those 20 years I felt normal (well as normal as I can be ha ha). It's a hard road but the support out there is truly amazing. There are a number of friends on this site who are very long term survivors so there's plenty of role models. Keep positive & any help you need - you got it. Love Pam",

      "Content": "Hi Flo Don't know how long it takes to grow back fully as it was just starting to grow in again when I started 2nd type of chemo. Yes unfortunately still on morphine. I have tried to do without but the pain just is too much in my back. I have managed to reduce the dose though. Had a MRI yesterday to see what is happening in my spine as the pain contradicts the reduced tumour marker results. I get 5th of 6 Taxotere tomorrow if white counts are high enough. I was put back a week as they were nearly zero last week so it was too dangerous to give me another dose. Hang on in there Flo. You will be amazed at where you get your strength from at times. As I write this my healing crystal is casting multi coloured prisms over my keyboard & I visualise them healing me. Every positive thought no matter where it comes from is a step in the right direction & every negative one helps the cancer to grow so kick out the negative & welcome in the positive no matter where it comes from. Love & hugs to you & hubby. Pam",

Sooner you get it done with the sooner you get a new head of hair. Talk to you doctor about the side effects you had & they can adjust the treatment & meds to suit so they are minimal.

She lost but she fought to the end. Jist go & kick butt butt like she did. Like me you have your family to give you the strength to fight & all of us here. I found the hormones are a great fighter for the lung tumours. You are on Femara so it should help to fight them. You have survived the breast & liver mets. Think of ot as just one more hurdle in the great hurdle race of life. I am thinking of you & pulling for you. Hang on in there Judy. Love & hugs Pam",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. They decided last week that the Adriamycin second time around was not working so after 2 doses have abandoned it. MArkers are rising to new highs again so they are trying Zeloda. I am given a 15% chance of it working. Side effects minimal so far (mostly nausea). I am having more radiation in left shoulder as tumour has flared there in shoulder joint. Also tumour in C7 vertebrae growing & causing semi-paralysis in left leg. Hopefully this treatment will knock it back enough to avoid the wheel chair option for a bit longer. This bloody disease is nibbling away at my quality of life but I will not give in. They will have to drag me out kicking & screaming. If I have problems I will get hubby John to post for me. He fell down the stairs last weekend (no not on the bottle) & is walking with a cane like me. We have one good pair of legs between us right now. Love & hugs to all Pam",

As soon as my marker levels start to rise before too long a new tumor appears. My onco says this is not always the case but I seem to be strongly indicative like that so he does my markers every week while I am still in active disease stage. When I have beaten it he will reduce to 3 monthly checks but will always include blood marker tests. Love Pam",

      "Content": "Usually chemo is given first only when a lumpectomy is scheduled. It reduces the tumour so that a smaller margin needs to be taked to be sure. Not usually done for infiltrating cancers. By the way infiltrating is the same as invasive. Your friend should ask the right questions & put on hold treatment until she is sure what is going on. It all seems wrong to me the way they are going about it. Try reading The Breast Cancer Survivors Manual by Dr. John Link. Very easy to understand & very very helpful with what questions to ask your treatment provider. Love & hugs Pam",

      "Content": "I went to clinic today & got CT results & 4th chemo. The lung tumours are definitely all gone - what a blessing as they were the real life threatening ones. Also my marker tests (which are done 3 weekly) are starting to fall again. They had gone as high as 170 before I started chemo & after 3 cycles are now down to 120. Oncologist says a level of 20 at end of 6 cycles would be wonderful but unlikely. He is looking for 80-90 by the end which would mean a 8 months to 2 years remission. It will eventually fail there is no hope for a permanent cure - failing a miracle & he doesn't discount those - but he has about 4 more chemo cocktails up his sleeve so we are looking at at least 5 years (I feel 5 years is all I can realistically hope for but I will fight for more) & who knows what cures or treatments are around the corner. I just know I get so sick of the constant pain & would give almost anything to feel pain free without drugs for just a few days. For all of you who include me in your prayers - THANK YOU. For al those new to the site I am living proof that you can survive cancer for a long time. 20+ years in my case so hang on in there and pray for new cures that may save us all yet. You are all in my prayers. Love to you all. Pam",
