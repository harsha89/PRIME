      "Content": "Hi, I finished chemo a little over 2 years ago (after single mastectomy and followed up by radiation). I've been in \"chemopause\" ever since. Was not even peri-menopausal before chemo, and I come from a family history of very hardy, long-lived ovaries on both sides of the family. Last September I had a period. Notified the onc, since I'm on Arimedex. Got in for a blood test for hormones, but they said blood test showed I was in menopause - couldn't be a period. Sure seemed like one to me - my face broke out and I had all the usual symptoms. Well - it's back again, with the usual symptoms, break-outs on face, some light cramping, 1 tender breast. Has anyone else had this experience? I'm confused about the hormone thing - how accurate is the blood test for this? On one hand it is worrysome because of my cancer type, but it's also sort of cool that my body might be throwing off the last of the chemo effects. jill",

      "Content": "hi! I worked the whole time too - I had dose dense treatments - 12 A/C (every week) followed by 6 taxol (every week). I worked in a cubicle that was pretty isolated and I kept my hands clean after being around others. I didn't have any issues except fatigue and pain toward the end of the treatments. No nausea or anything - I took every drug they would give me! I didn't have much trouble with the radiation either - just the changes in skin at the end of treatment, and I got really tired of going! jill",

      "Content": "Hi Vicki, My husband works in a grocery store and his feet hurt so bad he could hardly stand up or walk. We went to a place where they sell foot orthotics (I think that's how you spell it) They take a computer measurement of your foot - where the arches are, size, etc. Then they give you these insole things that match your foot. The insoles will fit in your regular shoes. My husband noticed a difference as soon as he put the insoles in his shoes at the shop. One thing you learn is what size your feet really are. My husband was wearing 11 1/2, turns out his feet are 10 1/2 WW. They will try to sell you shoes, but they will also tell you the different brands of shoes that are better for your feet, and not all are expensive brands (like sketchers has some good athletic shoes)The people that work in these places have some sort of certification (at least here in Washington state) so they have some training in feet. Some insurance plans cover the orthotics so it might be something to look into. I've just gotten new insurance and my feet hurt too! So I'm going to check out. I'm 2 years out from chemo, but I do take arimedex and I know that my feet have changed shape/size since chemo. My expensive danskos are killing my feet and they used to feel good! But if your feet hurt it pretty much ruins your whole day! hope you find relief! jill",

      "Content": "Hi, I've been on Femara for about 2 1/2 months. My shoulders, knees, wrists and hands are very painful. I've had a few weeks off (school is out for me right now) and I'm sleeping 12-18 hours a day. How do you handle these femara side effects? Ibuprofen seems to help the pain, but I have to keep taking it (and taking it) I feel like I'm 1000 years old, but I'm only 44! thanks, jill",
