I have never had trouble with depression or even feeling down..but there are mornings when I just don't want to start the day. I personally think chemo is the reason. I take industrial amounts of Vitamin D from my Diabetes doctor..butit has been shown that low vitamin D levels are very important to breast cancer. Many tests have also shown that men should be taking 1,000 units a day to ward off prostrate cancer,heart disease and depression..so maybe the larger amounts of vitamin D will help your feelings. I am thinking of you. I remember we started this trip about the same time and I have felt a little down lately..so maybe it's just another track along the road to being healthy.",
