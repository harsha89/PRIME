      "Content": "I stopped smoking in 1999. I used a website. Quitnet.org I'm not sure if it still viable, but it helped alot. I made cig soup...gross. I put ashes in a jar with water and buts. When I wanted a smoke I'd look at that or take a whiff. I also once ate a clove of garlic. Just don't smoke one. I quit cold turkey. Before that I had tried patches and gum. I smoked 2 packs a day. I'm grateful I don't smoke today. I know it is a challenge to stop smoking. I planned my quit date too. Good luck to you! remember just one reignites the cravings.",

      "Content": "Yes I was a grump for awhile. My son escaped to grandmas. I read somewhere also that when I was really craving to take deep breaths. The reason was that as smokers sometimes the only time we took deep breaths was to inhale. It seemed to help. If you want to email me you can. Having the BB to vent on and to talk to others it really helped me. I used a quit clock to see the time and $$$ I saved. Set a goal for what you will do with the money you save.",
