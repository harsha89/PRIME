I got the mammogram done and didn't even get redressed before the Doctor came in and told me it was cancer and that I needed to find a Surgeon. So maybe it is good news that they didn't have an immediate answer. But I would call every day or maybe even two times a day until you get an answer. I don't think Doctors truly understand how much not knowing drives us nuts. Hope you get a good answer soon. Take care... God bless...",

Mine went close to being as low as when they diagnois people with Congestive Heart Failure. I finally had to stop taking Herceptin. But the deal is if you have a low heart ejection ratio it takes a long time for it to return to normal. Mine took almost 1 year. This may not be an issue for you... but it is an easy check to do (An echocardiagram) if the Onc thinks this could be an issue. They have drugs that can help if this is part of the problem.

I hope that you will find someone here that has that type of experience. I know a lady (only vaguely) from my Onc office that has been Stage IV for over 10 years. She goes to M.D. Anderson in Texas for some of her checkup and uses them for protocols. I live in S.C. so it is closer and it is associated with the Medical Center that we have here. Johns Hopkins should be a great place to go. Getting a second opinion will at least give you more peace of mind. We all understand the fear. The beast has a way of getting deep in our heads... but with time... you can decide to kick it out of your head.... it is not easy... But give yourself a break you have just been given an extremely scary diagnosis and it takes a while to get your head around the trip. I just wanted you to know that you will be in my prayers.

I actually found that the taxol was not as hard on me as the A/C. It was still a trip. I stayed pretty tired the whole time from about the 3rd A/C treatment on... but I was able to work at least a couple days a week the whole time. The biggest problem with Taxol was that my fingernails go real sour and turned dark.. (I finally started painting them) and the tips of my fingers and my toes got a little numb (pins & needles). Most of that is gone now. I also gain a fair amount of weight and was puffy... 6-8 weeks after last Chemo, my body has returned to normal. I had another little surgery to do afterwards and I am now moving on to Radiation treatments and continuing my herceptin. And this week.... My hair started growing.... I know several ladies that are ahead of us. One has been in and out of treatment for 4 years. We are the lucky ones because herceptin was here for us when we needed it. For Ms. Betty she didn't get herceptin until she had a recurrence. Ms. Betty has now for the first time kept from finding a recurrence for about 6 months, she is delighted. It appears that herceptin is truly a wonder drug. My Doctor says that that one drug alone has cut my risk of recurrence by itself by 50%. I have every reason to believe that I will be around to see my son get married and to get to enjoy my Grandchildren....(he isn't even considering getting married yet...) so I think HER-2 is no longer nearly the problem it used to be.

With mine, the choice was made for me to stay on a drug called Herceptin for 1 full year. We actually started it at the same time as I was finishing the Taxol part of my Chemo. Herceptin is not a chemo drug but it is administered by IV. The good thing is that it only works on the bad cells so you don't feel bad while you are taking it. The best I understand HER-2 is that we have a gene that is not normal and the Herceptin actually repairs the gene so it can't trigger the cancer again. Don't know if this helped. Take Care.",
