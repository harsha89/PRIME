    "Content": "Hello. I stumble across this board as I am doing my usual google search on breast cancer, bilateral mastectomy and sentinel node, etc... I am a 39 year old wife and mom of three beautiful children. I was diagnosed with DCIS in SITU of the left breast on 6/22/12 after a lumpectomy. I am having a bilateral mastectomy with expanders on 07/24/12. Due to my dense breast tissue my cancer was only detected with lumpectomy. Mammo, ultra sound and MRI did not detect any presence of cancer. Reading your comment about \"crying the first time\" is my fear. This and me not waking after surgery keep me up at night. I am afaid of looking like frankenstein after. I can't imagine not having nipples. My girlfriend told me that I will be like Barbie and everyone loves Barbie. My husband is very reassuring and tells me not to worry. So much easier than said. I can deal with the thought of being in pain after I just can't deal with the thought of what I will look like. Any tips?",
