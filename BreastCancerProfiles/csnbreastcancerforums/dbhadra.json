I start Taxoxifen after my rads are done..around the end of September...I'm very grateful that I am ER+ so I can take something that will hopefully keep the beast at bay...but I am concerned about side effects. I;m also overweight (since way before diagnosis also!) and heard that this can cause weight gain. I;ve increased my exercise as it seems to help a lot with my anxiety/depression and hope that will at least keep me at the same weight level as before. I'm taking Effexor for depression/anxiety and that is also supposed to help with the hot flashes, I;ve been told. Also, is it true that Tamoxifin increases your fertility? (I've heard it called the \"anti-birth control pill). I;m in kind of chemopause since January but did have one period recently, not sure if that was a one month fluke or I am again going to be getting it monthly. Laura Laura",

      "Content": "Interested to hear people's reactions to this story: Sunday night, I started running a fever - fairly low - around 100 - but was rising and my throat was sore so I called the line for the on-call doctor. They said to call back if he did not call back in 20 minutes, so I did. Then he called me back and said that I could either (1) get a prescription at an all night drugstore or (2) go to the hospital and get evaluated as my WBCs had been very low on Thursday. At first I thought that I would get the prescription, but didn;t have the pharmacy number, so he then said \"call back the on- call line with the drugstore information.\" After talking with my husband, I decided to go to the hospital to get my WBCs checked and also to get the antibiotic via IV. So I called back from my cell phone, to the number the doctor had called me from, and left a message that I was headed for the hospital. I also called the on-call answering service and left the same message. The doctor then called me back and told me, \"There is no need to call my cell phone. My family may be sleeping. There is no neccessity to let me know you are going to the hospital as the hospital will let me know when you arrive.\" I was floored, murmured something vague about assumed that the number he called me from was a hospital number, and got off the phone. Was he out of line, or was I? Laura",

I know what you mean though about the seed of doubt. Sometimes I feel like I am always trying to read the body language and other nuances to find out what they are not telling me. Sorry that you felt upset after seeing him, just going to see the oncologist is stressful enough and sorry that you felt even more stress on top of that. Thoughts and prayers coming your way, Laura",

After a painful grieving process I'm now trying to see that as a potentially good thing...there is no doubt that I live in the moment, appreciate little things more, and get less annoyed with things that don;t really matter, than ever before. That's the good part. the bad part and the part I still grieve about is the loss of the feeling of security about life...even if that security was an illusion it was comforting and I have to admit that I do envy people who have not been through this life changing diagnosis. On my good days, I tell myself that it is what it is and I deal with it. On my bad days, I struggle with the reality of having this disease and all the implications of it. Living one day at a time , right now, I try to stay in the present moment and out of the future anxiety. Easier said than done at times! Best to you, Laura",

If you have symptoms of depression for more than two weeks, it's recommended that you seek treatment. I waited too long and then when I started calling doctors, no one could take me for more than 2-3 weeks. I decided that was too long and went to the ER, and they put it in to see the doc tomorrow. I was diagnosed 8 months ago, and felt sad/blue/crying a few times, very normal reactions to a cancer diagnosis and treament! But this last episode lasting a whole month has been totally different and that's why I decided to seek treatment for it. Wishing you the best, Laura",
