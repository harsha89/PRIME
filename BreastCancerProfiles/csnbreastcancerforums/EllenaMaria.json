Of course I hope no one I know ever understands this, I don't want any more \"sisters\". But for those of us who are bonded by this beast it is nice to know we are not alone. Whenever I hear a friend say they are having an ultra sound after a mammo I get so worried. I don't want to extend the membership to anyone. But they take comfort in knowing they can come to me now. Which is kinda why I think I got this, to be there for others. Getting it is so important.",

      "Content": "Best thing sinced sliced bread! I had mine put in under conscious sedation. Drowsy the whole time and cannot remember the middle part where they actually put it in. Removal was done in same outpatient center. They reopened the scar and pulled it out. They only used lidocaine, promised to do the c sedation if it was bad. I felt like such a baby, it was so easy. Using a port is fine. I hate being stuck. First time they iced it numb. Second time I didn't and it is barely a prick. I am thin, especially on chest. I too thought it was weird laying on that side at night. I kept mine after removal and it makes a lovely key fob. My husband rounds on dialysis patients. He was so excited to hear about me using a port, he only wished his patients could have them. He too recommended immediate removal when chemo was done. Most have no problem leaving it in, and some have to. But it has to be flushed regularly and there is a chance of infection. It is a foreign item in your body. Enjoy it. When they draw your blood, if before chemo, they hook the line up and then they tap into it for the blood. Then they untap it it is ready for the chemo. One stick. Before I had mine put in I went online to see what it was all about. There was a wonderful older gentleman who had step by step pictures taken before, during and after. It made it so easy to understand. Unfortunately by the time I saw his site he had passed away. It was so wonderful that even after he lost his battle he was able to give so much. Although I forgot his name I will never forget the gift.",

      "Content": "So when my nephew was about 8 my sis and her husband were exiting the church with everyone. They were all standing around outside when the crowd turned toward the side of the building. My nephew and the pastor's son were peeing on the building. My nephew says outloud, \"Now my dad says to shake it three times.\" Fast forward to 15. He is not allowed to be with his girlfriend anymore. Turns out the girl's mom was letting them have sex at her house, etc. He yells at my sis, \"You're taking the best sex I will ever have from me!\" He is now 25 and my sis loves reminding him of that comment. Now this is not funny but so like my lovely daughter. After my lumpectomy I was told to not lift anything for 24 hrs and then nothing more than 5lbs after that. The next day when I asked my daughter to do the dishes she replies with a curled lip, head bobbing, \"Why? It's been more than 24hrs.\" I knew everthing was alright with her. I would have been really worried if she had actually offered to help.",
