I thought that this poem was very appropriate considering all the love that I have seen written in the posts on the discussion boards. I hope that you all enjoy reading it. Love of a Friend Sometimes sisters are born to the Same family Learning to love, speak and act In much the same ways Sometimes sisters are brought together By God God knew from the start that we would One day need each other Be part of each other\u2019s lives He brought us through many of the same Circumstances and adversities Then He brought us together To stand by each other, to lean on To learn from and to love There is no greater love between friends Than the love of friends Who become sisters I love you My sister and My friend by beetle25(PC)",
