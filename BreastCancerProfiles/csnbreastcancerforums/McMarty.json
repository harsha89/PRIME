      "Content": "Carol, I'm speechless.  I think the hardest thing is watching the looks on the faces of our family members.  Sometimes there just aren't any exact right answers and this sure seems like one of those times. You really do have to make decisions that give you the most peace.  It's really nice to hear that you are feeling better and enjoying food again.  It's funny how much little things like that mean.  You are in my prayers and I'm hoping you have MANY enjoyable days and make some special memories with each one you care about.  Hugs to you, Marty",

Why can't someone send me a cupcakes cure cancer email?  THAT would be helpful! That boy must really love you!  He didn't just tell you about it - he made sure you HAD one.  Give him a BIG HUG and try not to roll your eyes in front of him :)",

      "Content": "I wonder why your dr took you off of Tamoxifen if it was still working?  Were there signs it was beginning to fail, side effects you were wrestling?  Or did the Dr just want to try some new stuff? Anyway, it sounds like there are lots of positives going on for you!  It's great that the bone scan showed no trouble.  Be sure to be real SPECIFIC and ask if that scan would show if there were cancer in your ribs.  I had that implant one time.  I didn't have any trouble with it but I just had them take out my ovaries so I wouldn't have to keep wrestling with those trouble makers.  Probably you just pulled a muscle or slept on it wrong!  I hope it gets better VERY soon and the good news keeps on coming your way!",
