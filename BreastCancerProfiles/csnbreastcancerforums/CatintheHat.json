    "Content": "I'm new to this site and I wish I knew about it when I started going thru treatment. I found my lump in the left breast and was diagnosed in Sept 08. I had chemo first then a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction followed by a lot of physical therapy then finally radiation treatments. I just recently finished all my treatments and the only thing left is surgery in Dec 09 to swap out the skin expanders for silicone implants. I want to celebrate in some way the fact that I survived treatment and invite all my family and friends that helped me thru it all but I'm at a loss as to what to do. I know it sounds like it should be a simple decision after all the difficult decisions I've made but I am just at a loss as to what to do - I'm blaming it on 'chemo brain' so I thought I'd put it out to you guys and see if any of you did something to celebrate.",
