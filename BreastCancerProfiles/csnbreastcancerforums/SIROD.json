      "Content": "Annie, As time goes by, you will forget all about the lost. I didn't believe the friend who told me she never thinks about it at the time I had a mastectomy. Today, I believe she was 100% correct. I never think of the lost breast. I work in a school, I remember a young man who developed osteosarcoma and had a cadaver bone graft replace the one he lost to cancer. He had one infection after another and finally agreed to have his leg amputated after a long struggle. There was a young lady who was briefly at our school and as I was helping her, I noticed her prosthetic arm. When I see how brave these young people are, those who struggle to adjust to their lost limb, dealing with other serious cancer or medical issues that require wheelchairs. My lost of a breast was easy to adjust. Not trying to diminish the lost of loosing a breast. In due time, it isn't the biggest adjustment one needs to make in life, we will all encounter lost which will make this encounter not so bad. I do understand how you feel as I have been there. I can write now from a viewpoint of many years. Wishing you the best on this journey, Doris",

Congratulations on the great news from your daughter.   I am certain that planning a wedding is just the most wonderful of experiences a mother can have.  Your daughter will be ok. I have had both.  My liver enzymes went to triple out of normal range and alk phos elevated enough for concerns but never had a real reason on why they went up.  We did scans and after several months, they settled back into normal range.  I could never figure out why and I don't believe my primary or oncologist did either. Hoping it is the case for you.  No matter what stage breast cancer one can never let down their guard as this is a very sneaky, sly disease.  I hate it more and more each day.   I wish they would find the cause now so they can find a cure.  I would be happier with the cure. Positive thoughts are sent to you and keep your mind on the wedding... sounds like fun. Doris  ",

In 1994, one year was considered overkill, I was given an option of two types CMF or CAF or I could join a trial for Taxol.  Now many I notice on here have chemo, surgery and more chemo.  In February, I was unable to Xeloda due to the fact I was taking folic acid with Methotrexate.  My oncologist suggested Taxol and that is what I'm doing.  Stage IV, doesn't have a chemo \"end date\".  I envy those who do now. Hormonals such as Tamoxifen when I began in 1995 was for 5 years.  Then they added an aromatase inhibitor to the deal, adding more years.  In the past few years they have suggested Tamoxifen be used for 10 years.  When Tamoxifen came out back in 1970's, Rita Arditti who I am fond of saying she lived 30 years with mets, used Tamoxifen for 17 years.  When it failed, she went on an aromatase inhibitor. When I began Tamoxifen in 1995, aromatase inhibitors was in the future.  When Tamoxifen failed me, I began Arimidex which had just came out a year or two before my recurrence. Things change a lot and I don't believe there is a book that says, you must do it this way.  I believe at a METS conference last Fall it was mentioned how widespread everything is, no pattern, no fast and hard rule to follow. Ms. Davis best bet is still a 2nd opinion from a qualified oncologist.  I agree with you Roz, her oncologist sounded as though he just made an off the cuff remarked. Best to you, Doris  ",

Santa can't bring us all a cure, because he would need scientists to be working on metastatic breast cancer which is not very well funded. Out of the billions raised only 2% goes in research for MBC. Komen, the best funded of all the groups, designate a biggest profits raised from \"Race for the Cure\" to awareness not research. I am irate for women like you because your only option is chemotherapies. So you are not crazy. Can you not find another oncologist, one that will see you? I refuse to see the NP. I am paying to see the oncologist, so are you. I appreciate the knowledge of NP but for stage IV, it should be the oncologist that you see for your appointments. If your stable on the next scan, why can't you have a break from treatment?\" My oncologist stated that \"breaks are needed as they were not here to torment us\". Ask to see you oncologist and ask when you can expect a break from treatment. Thinking of you and wishing you some hope for a little joy. Doris",

I am against profiling, but.............. it's time at our airports. The Fourth Amendment is being violated. For our safety, but............. is there a limit to what we will put up with in the future, is nakedness next? I'm with you Carkris, I have no problems after all these years, to take my prosthesis out and dump it in their bins. No one is going to take me to a private room to feel me, especially non medical people. I use my prosthesis when traveling as a bank. I keep my money, credit cards and a copy of my passport in a little pocket tied with a pin to the cover of the prosthesis. I keep only the money I need on hand and one credit card in my purse, along with my passport. On year, I had a ct scan the day after returning from a trip. I had forgotten to remove the little pocket. The tech said, you have some metal on, and then I remembered. I reached in and hand him the prosthesis. He always remembers me when I go for a scan. We joke about it. I am certain that he had never seen a breast prosthesis up to that time. My primary doctor hadn't either and I showed her what it looked and felt like. After 9/11, at the Washington DC airport, I was picked along with a young boy (blond, blue eyes) around 8 years old. I didn't carry a purse. I only had a paperback. My bag had been checked in. I said very loudly, \"now I really feel safe on this plane!\". No one needed an explanation. The article: Israeli airport security skips scanners, favours profiling By Jeff Abramowitz Apr 12, 2010, 6:07 GMT Tel Aviv - Israel's Ben Gurion Airport is considered one of the most secure in the world, even without passengers having to pass through an obtrusive body scanner. Simply put, the security in place at Ben Gurion is based on the premise of 'find the attacker, and you prevent the attack,' or what Rafael Ron, a former director of security at the airport, calls, 'the human factor.' 'Without a person who intends to do harm, an attack will not take place,' he says, explaining a system which - although obviously alert for weapons - concentrates on people, questioning them and, if deemed necessary, subjecting them to further interrogation and even physical searches. Critics say this method is racist, since it involves racial profiling. Arab passengers, or non-Jews, for example, are routinely subjected to greater questioning than are Israeli Jews. Backers point out that the system works. The last time an El Al Israel Airlines aircraft was successfully hijacked was in 1968. Moreover, no aircraft has ever been hijacked out of Ben Gurion Airport. The terrorists who took over an Air France flight in 1976 - the hijacking which culminated in the Israeli army's rescue of the hostages in Entebbe, Uganda - boarded the plane during a stopover in Athens. Although airport officials insist that 'we do not give any information regarding our safety procedures and methods,' enough is known of Ben Gurion's security practices to ignite the debate whether other airports in the world should 'Israelify' their security. It's a debate which has become more urgent since December 25, when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to blow up an aircraft en route from Amsterdam to Detroit. Advocates of the Israeli method say he would never have been allowed onto an aircraft leaving Ben Gurion airport. The multi- layered, not always obvious, security in place would ensure that he would have aroused suspicion, and been stopped, questioned and arrested long before he boarded his flight. The first security layer manifests itself at the entrance to the airport complex, a good distance from the terminal. Every vehicle entering the airport is stopped, and the passenger asked a seemingly innocuous question: 'Where are you coming from?' In most cases the answer is not important. But the way it is delivered is. Questioners are looking for signs of nervousness, or stress, or evasiveness. The second and third layers can be found outside the airport terminal, where armed guards scrutinize, often seemingly casually, passengers as they alight from their vehicle and move to the building. At the door to the terminal, more guards are stationed. These sometimes stop random passengers to question them, while looking for signs of suspicious behaviour. The 'hard' security begins inside the terminal, on the way to the check-in counter. Each passenger is asked some standard questions, such as when they packed their luggage, was their luggage with them all the time after being packed, did anyone give them anything to take on board the plane with them. At the same time, their flight documents and passports are examined. This often leads to profiling. Most Israeli Jews are waved though to put their luggages on the X- ray machines. Arabs or non-Jews, on the other hand, are subjected to more intense questioning, and sometimes checked physically. Advocates of the system maintain that the profiling is not solely ethnic, religious or national, but it based on factors which include behaviour and attitude. 'If you are a bona fide passenger, you answer the questions in a normal way. If you have something to hide, there will be physiological changes: People become white, their Adam's apple jumps, they get angry and jump up and down,' Isaac Yeffet, a former El Al security chief, now a security consultant in New York, told the Wall Street Journal. Another 'hard' security layer, comes after passport control, when hand baggage is X-rayed and passengers are asked to pass through metal detectors. And finally, passports and boarding cards are checked just before the passenger is allowed onto the aircraft. The Israeli method has been scrutinized and even proposed for adoption, especially since Abdelmuttab's aborted attack, but its supporters acknowledge it may not be suitable for worldwide implementation. For a start, Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main air terminal, handles around 11.5 million passengers a year - a paltry figure compared to other major airports, but one that makes the Israeli system relatively easy to implement. The cost of training enough staff to handle all the passengers who pass through a major airport could also been seen as prohibitive. Even beyond that, lies the problem of social mores. Whether it is called 'behavioral recognition,' or some other euphemism, the spectre of complaints, pr even possible court action, is likely prevent its implementation elsewhere.",

When I had recurrences, I did the same thing and found it helpful not to dwell on the negative and find the right combination of drugs to help me.  I have as I just past my 18th year mark last summer. You received good advise from many ladies here to ask your oncologist for a little help and some depression medication.  That is good advise.  Also changing your name from  \"Unhappy\"  to something positive might be helpful. We are all here to help you on this journey you didn't want to go on.   Wishing you the best,   Doris",

You were diagnose with breast cancer and again you don't state the stage or the kind.  If you were diagnose with stage IV, you will be treated and perhaps if ER+/PR+ or HER2+ will be given some other form of treatment and go on with your life. 70% of women and men never have a recurrence and there is no reason why you should not think yourself among them.  it is hard to think that positive when going through treatment.  That I do remember of my time in that mode. I can't walk anymore due to a medical problem but when I did, walking was a wonderful stress reliever.  I hope it will be the same for you.  It was my kind of depression medication.  Walk, walk, walk... and I would feel 90% better.

I believe everyone should have these \"end of life\" directives in order to avoid the confusion that happened when your sister-in-law went to hospice. What was done to your sister-in-law to withhold food and water is what I would like to have done along with pain medication when it is my time. I have stage IV breast cancer also..

Lymph node dissections are worse, but they don't do those these days unless they find more lymph nodes with problems. I hope you won't have to have one of these.

She is dealing according to your post to a recurrence from her new cancer of 2004. Chemotherapy, surgery and radiation should take care of her cancer. Her prognosis should be excellent. There is however, no 100% guarantee to anyone diagnose with breast cancer. You don't mention the stage but you posted that there isn't any cancer that was found in any other area. Her recurrence remains a local one as it is in the area of the breast. She is not stage IV which is only when cancer cell go to the bones, brain, liver, lungs or some further area away from the breast. Following is a web page explaining stages by the National Cancer Institute. http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/Patient/page2 As I said, there are no guarantees, but I would say that your mother should have every expectations to live out her normal span of years.

They will keep you coming as long as you want. I always thought of it as steady income for them. I always take the initiative in telling my doctors, I think we can begin seeing each other on a yearly basis from now on. Some I just say, until there is a problem, thank you and hope to never see you again. I do say \"in this setting\". I go on to say, it would be nice to see you in a restaurant, museum, play, concert or mall or where ever else people gather. Best wishes, Doris",

Use to be when they began giving Tamoxifen to women, they were afraid of endometrial cancer when so many had thickening of the uterus lining. Though it happens, it is a rare. I had lots of bleeding episode that is why I had so many endometrial biopsies. That is all my then oncologist at the time and my then gyn/ob doctor could come up with instead of thinking outside the box. The thickening was always notice in my ct scans long before the bleeding episodes as were cyst on the ovaries. I was off Tamo and on Arimidex when the bleeding had started and had been in chemical menopause for 6 years. What it turned out to be was polyps in the uterus. A D&C took care of it all and never had a problem since that time. I was offered progesterone also by gyn/ob doctor. I was 50% progesterone + and 95% estrogen +. I went to a doctor whose specialty was gynecology. I am not certain why they would offer progesterone when your cancer is hormonal positive. Best wishes for a benign outcome, Doris",

I also dealt with toxic shock from a staph infection which I wasn't expected to live.  I am a tough old lady and I kept going.     I had 2 more surgeries in the next 4 years, one of them was related to cancer, it was a regional recurrence.  Radiation killed my saliva gland and I lost all the teeth on the side that was radiated. Then they found mets to 2 ribs.  Arimidex kept me NED for 8 years.  Then a more serious recurrence in both lungs, pleura and pleura effusion which needed a VATS biopsy.  Prior to finding a returned of the cancer, I had one surgery related to cancer, 3 more that were not.  I developed fibromyalgia and inverse psoriasis.  Sometimes, I wonder why this all happened to me.  There really isn't any answer.  I have good insurance and do take good care of myself and enjoy life when I'm in between these happenings.   Sometimes, the surgeries had complications and I just deal with it hoping things will work out and they usually do.  I am almost five years out since the recurrence in 2008, I have had 4 progressions which needed a change of drugs.     Again, one has to play the hand that is given, it's not fun, it's not for the timid at heart but you will find that deep down you have the right stuff to pull yourself through another ordeal that you wish you hadn't had.    I have had both cataracts remove from my eyes.  Due to my uveitis, the lens clouded up and I needed to have them lasered.  It took a while due to finding a time when the inflammatory cells were quiet enough to allow them to be lasered, one at a time over several weeks.  I can really see again! I don't need reading glasses any more and use my glasses only to drive.  When your better, go have those cataracts removed.   Wishing you the best in having a good surgery with a recovery that is uneventful.    Another traveler on a journey I didn't want to take and neither did you,   Doris  ",

I did suffer burns in my neck but they did have a solution.  A year later, having the saliva gland killed, I did loose the bottom half of my teeth on the side that was radiated.  I needed a bridge. Even given that, I would never hesistate to do radiation.  Of course, I wouldn't seek it out either.  I found it easier than surgery, certainly easier than chemo and easier than hormonal therapies I used for 18 years.  If you fear it don't.  It looks scary on your first visit but one gets use to the equipment and how good the techs are. It was time consuming I had 36 treatments and given the holidays, and etc. It seem to go on forever.  They were the best organized of any medical group I ever encountered.  I could almost time how long it would be except for thetimes I saw the radiologist..  I did have 1 hour ride one way and another hour back home, those were the big draw back.  I worked throughout radiation, leaving 15 minutes early each day in order to make my appointment.   Good wishes to you and may you be among the 70% of people who never have a recurrence Sk12.  I hope you enjoyed your trip to Miami.  Wonderful in March if you come from the northern parts of the US.

Now scientists say vaccines could hold the key\u2014not just to a cure but to wiping out cancer forever. You can read the whole article to large to post here at the following website: http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/12/11/could-this-be-the-end-of-cancer.html I read the article while waiting for my doctor. This paragraph caught my eye, especially about the two new drugs for metastatic bc out last week. :( After four decades of largely unfulfilled hopes\u2014Dec. 23 marks 40 years since President Nixon declared war on cancer\u2014scientists have hit on a potential cure that few thought possible a few years ago: vaccines. If they succeed, cancer vaccines would revolutionize treatment. They could spell the end of chemotherapy and radiation, which can have horrific side effects, which tumor cells often become resistant to, and which often make so little difference it would be laughable were it not so tragic: last week, for instance, headlines touted two new drugs for metastatic breast cancer even though studies failed to show that they extend survival by a single day. Vaccines could make such \u201cadvances\u201d a thing of the past. And they could make cancer as preventable, with a few jabs, as measles. \u201cCould\u201d is the key word. Cancer vaccines are still being tested. Patients, doctors, and scientists know only too well that seemingly wondrous cancer therapies can flame out. But progress is accelerating. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever tumor vaccine, called Provenge, to treat prostate cancer. Scores of other vaccines are in the pipeline. Over the summer, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania unveiled what they call a cancer \u201cbreakthrough 20 years in the making\u201d: a vaccine against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that has brought about remissions of up to a year and counting\u2014and which its inventors believe can be tweaked to attack lung cancer, ovarian cancer, myeloma, and melanoma. Vaccines against pancreatic and brain cancer are also being tested. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d says Disis, who has a $7.9 million grant from the Pentagon to develop a preventive vaccine, \u201cclinical trials [of cancer vaccines] are demonstrating anti-tumor efficacy in numbers of patients with cancer, not just one or two unique individuals.\u201d Keyword is \"COULD\" as in all these \"hopes\". This is no different than the post a few months ago by Skipper54 on treatment breakthrough\". Wonderful to know but, reality will be when it is here. Doris",

I needed to learn what was Femara pain and what was the pain for my PTTD in my foot. After 3 weeks, the severe Femara pain went away. I remain off of it for 4 more weeks. Then I rebooted Femara giving myself another 7 weeks back on the drug before scanning. The pain returned 24 days after starting the drug. The tumors showed a slight increase and the next scan (6 months later) they were back to where they were before the vacation. Seven years ago, I was on Arimidex (in remission from bone involvement) and fell. I developed three vertebrae compression fracture. I gave myself 6 weeks off the drug to allow my body to heal. I didn't develop more metastasis until 3 years ago. I would say you are very, very safe. I hope this relieves your mind. Best, SIROD",

They will probably need a biopsy of the cells in your spine or liver to see if you are still ER/PR positive and if the HER2 status changed to positive. What they give you depends a lot on age (your young) and what it is now, positive or negative. Usually with lesions in an organ they do chemotherapy even if you are triple positive this time around. I am in my 17 1/2 year since diagnose. When it recurred for the 3rd time after a long period of actually being NED since my 2nd recurrence, I did have a biopsy. This is to make certain the cells were the same and mine were. The 3rd time, I had tumors everywhere in both lungs and lining along with an effusion. I was given a choice and I am in my 6th decade, so I decided to try another hormonal therapy. I have since had 3 progressions and my next scan is this week. I expect good news. One can live many years with this disease. I hope this is helpful. Am very sorry that you have to return to this journey. I wish you well. Best, Doris",

There is so much to see.......from d'Orsay, the Louvre, Versaille, Moulin Rouge, Giverny and etc. I would love to go back, but walking is such a problem these days. I speak French so the language was not a problem for me. I think if you try, like people everywhere they are helpful. In Rome, I couldn't speak a word of Italian. This bus driver who took pity on me, understood what I wanted and even drove me to the street (or Ally) gave me sign language direction to the Pantheon. It totally amazed me how one can communicate in that manner. The food is out of this world, especially the pastry. I had to force myself not to go back for seconds. Walking does burn it off and one does walk a lot. Planning was a lot of fun, figuring out when and where to go. I did buy my \"Metro Pass\" online and it was waiting for me at my hotel, along with passes to major museum, d'Orsay, the Louvre and etc. It really helps and there is no line to wait as you show the pass.

Antinausea drug never worked in the past and I wonder if I suddenly hit a wall.  I am not strong but a weakling that wants to run away from this all.  Maybe I choose the wrong one.   There is no fun in life anymore.... needs some gumption not to cancel out on Wedneday.  My 3 treatment in cycle 2.

I had thickening of the uterus for over 6 years before it really was really necessary to perform a D&C. My cells were turning into cancer. What does the pathology report state? Are the cells normal or are they in the process of changing or have they changed? Perhaps your oncologist can prescribe an aromatase inhibitor for you instead of the drug Tamoxifen. A lot of women do go on AI's after a time on Tamoxifen. I would think this would be a better solution than having an invasive procedure such as a hysterectomy. Have a second opinion from another gynecologist and certainly include your oncologist before proceeding. Best to you, SIROD",

Even stage IV breast cancer can't be compared to pancreatic which doesn't give a good prognosis at all. The umbrella cancer is about the only thing they have in common. Enjoy your little granddaughter over the holidays. Remember all the good times you shared with your father. Best, Doris",

      "Content": "Dear Kat, One thing we do know is that we are the first to realize when something isn't working, were all so in tune to our bodies. More so when the signs are visiable. I am sorry Kat that xeloda isn't doing what you had hoped. I worked as a tour guide for some years for cruise ships that came to my area. The majority of people were over 40, a good many of them 60+ and although there were some people your age, it wasn't often. Those older people are probably more empathetic towards your situation that you realize. For those who stare, that is inexcusable. To be able to visit new places and take advantage of what the cruise offers can be a lot of fun. Working on those ships I imagine can be fun depending on your position but, a lot of it like any other job can become tedious. I always looked forward to a new season but, when the last cruise ship sailed off for that year, I was glad it was over. I often would take a tour or two when I travelled to a different place. I've been on both sides sides of the aisle. Much more fun being the one taking a tour, than giving a tour. Vacations are like that, it makes us always want this form of bliss to be forever. In this life, it always ends and we go back to the reality which we don't like. You are being cheated out of the years that is allocated to so many and everyone on this board grieves about it for you. There is no answer for the why. Please don't be so hard on yourself and you are not ungrateful, just a realist. Enjoy your time in paradise, knowing we all do understand that roller coaster you are on. Best, Doris",
