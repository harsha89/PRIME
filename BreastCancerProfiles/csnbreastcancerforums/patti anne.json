Anyway...insurance denied the removal and my plastic surgeon told me that legally, they had to pay to make my breasts symmetrical. I would definitely look into it further. That really ticks me off. Sorry. Patti (I ended up reconstructing the left side and when I did the nipple surgery, the PS lifted my right breast)",
