    "Content": "Hi everyone - I am brand new to the network. I was diagnosed in July 09 with breast cancer. Expected due to the high family incidence (mother, sister, 5 aunts). I underwent bilateral mastectomies, sentinel node biopsy and so far 4 of 6 chemo treatments. Chemo has not been unbearable but suffer more with the mastectomies incision site. I also have Lupus and Crohn's disease. Wondering if anyone out there experiencing issues because of these diseases and the cancer treatments?",
