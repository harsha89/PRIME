      "Content": "I take multivitamins and my onc didn't have a problem with it, but he didn't want me doing a bunch of other supplements and as I mentioned in an earlier posts, didn't want me trying to purposely eat a lot of antioxident loaded food. He didn't ask to see the vitamins, so now i'm a little worried too. lol if only we could channel our worries into energy. Lots of things have antioxidents, so if you drank green tea, but didn't eat a bunch of berries, maybe it all evens out. Just lay off the green tea until you ask your dr., but try,, and i can't believe i'm saying this, try not to worry. I hate when people tell me not to worry.",

      "Content": "I work for surgeons at one hospital and get my chemo and rad at MD Anderson (a different place). Both places told me that antioxidents stop the chemo from binding with the cells chemo is meant to kill. So, antioxidents if you are healthy are good because they keep the radicals from binding, but when you get cancer, you need to let the cells bind so the cancer can kill them. I'm not wording this exactly right, but my drs all said this is not the time to do anything but eat a normal healthy diet, do not add supplements. I was going to eat a lot of antioxident filled food and they said, just eat normal healthy meals.",
