Yes her story was sad, scary and everything else that we facing cancer can ever imagine. Pray for her, you and everyone on this site. We all will beat this. Have faith and believe. God bless, Babe",

Since i've been talking to people such as yourself Joyce I have felt more support and love via this site than i could have ever gotten from a live group of people. This is working fine for me. If people find that sitting in a filled room with alot of people talking about thier experiences with this disease helps them deal then much luv to them. I'm staying right here. Welcome home Joyce!!!!",
