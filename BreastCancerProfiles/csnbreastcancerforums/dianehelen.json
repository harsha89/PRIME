      "Content": "So, where are the new improvements? Still slow to load, still no direct way back to this board after looking at your profile, can any one point out anything that has changed other that a very slightly different look to the list of posts? You cannot respond to posts, it lets you preview, but when you hit submit, it just loops back to the preview And what happened to the link that was on the side bar for private messages (called csn email) *edit* ok now csn email link back, but all previous messages are gone And what's up with the formatting tips below the post window? It assumes everybody who participates here is a web programmer. I was hoping for better, I guess.. Oh well",
