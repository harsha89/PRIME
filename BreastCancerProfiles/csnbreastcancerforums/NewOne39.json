    "Content": " I am so confused I am told that I will have to have a Port or Central line or a Pic line but I don't know anything about them.  Has anyone with TNBC with mets, stage 4 had to undergo this treatment? If so which did you chose and why. I am in a study and at first they did not allow a line of any kind but now they have agreed to allow me to have one.  I really don't want one because it just scares me. I am also hearing that I will die fom TNBC with mets it may not be this week or this year but I will succumb to this disease.  I am really down now just hearing this comment. I have been going through the chemo and recently had a \"stereostatic\" treatment (my chemo was stopped during this time).  The radiologist told me that he would not do a PET scan because the last PET scan did not show any uptake so I will be scheduled towards the end of February for a CT scan.  questions  for . . . everyone with TNBC mets are you on chemo?  I am on Taxol, Avastin and (?) undisclosed study drug. Have you been told that you will be on chemo for the rest of your life?  Will chemo ever stop for those of us that are TNBC with mets. state 4?  ",
