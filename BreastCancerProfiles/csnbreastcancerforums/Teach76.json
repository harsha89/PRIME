We have had so much rain in PA in May, so it's hard to go out and purchase sunscreen when you still have the heat on in the house! Enjoy your vacation!",

D3, etc. may depend on age, weight, and why you might need these supplements.  I completely agree with Beepositive that movement plays a huge part in dealing with side effects.   If I sit too long, or find myself standing through a double class period, my body lets me know that I either need to move or need to rest a few minutes.  With some experience, we all come to recognize our personal signals.   Kathy",

      "Content": "Hi, friends!  I am almost 11 months out of treatment, and I do have multiple appointments scheduled in about 2 weeks (once school is over.).  the last time I saw my surgeon and had mammogram and US, she said a lump I was feeling was just scar tissue.  I am scheduled for a follow up mammogram and US before I see her.  I worry because after my neoadjuvant chemo I was congratulated that my cancer was \"gone,\". Then after surgery I was told that there were 2 areas of cells that had remained.  Praise God that I decided to continue with the surgery. My concern is that I feel the area of scar tisdue has grown larger.  Is this normal?  If the tests ordered do not conclusively prove this is just necrosis, what further testing should I request?  I have been under a tremendous amount of personal and professional stress, and I know that is not helping my perspective about what is going on physically.  I keep telling myself that 10 days from now I can begin to relax, but that is also when the onslaught of doctor appointments will start.  Oh, why did I do this to myself?!?!?  I was due back in May, but the end of a school year is no time to be taking off, and substitutes are difficult to find.  ( Sorry, pity party over now.)   thanks for letting me vent and for any advice as to questions I need to ask for my first annual appointments.  You are all terrific at thinking of things that seem so obvious, but when we are in stress/fear mode, we can not think.   Enjoy the sun if it passes your way today!

      "Content": "Being on Letrozole for 14 months I am still finding out effects that no one mentioned.  I realize the Internet can be a terrible, frightening source for us sometimes, but it can also be a source of information that we do not get elsewhere.  Over the last 6 months I have been placed on Lipitor for cholesterol, my blood pressure continues to be high, and now Lexapro has been added for anxiety.  Online research shows that Letrozole affects all of these.  I did not experience these issues initially. In September I had stopped the Letrozole a month before my daughter's wedding so that I could enjoy the day without joint pain and looking as though I needed to borrow a guest's walker or cane!  I had wondered what my SE would be once I resumed meds.  My hands were terrible - especially overnight, walking after sitting longer than 20 minutes was painful, and the anxiety began.   PCP wanted me to go back to Onco or surgeon to see if I could stop the AI.  Since I was told 10 years, I responded, \"No way will they let me stop.\"  Then I mentioned the research as to how Letrozole lowers seratonin in the brain - BINGO - take another drug (Lexapro) to combat that.  Is it all worth it?  Well, I am here.  Might I be damaging something else in my body? Maybe, but I have to function for my family and job.  We make many choices for our treatment, with the unknown always in the future. Accepting the gift of today, and always hoping for a better tomorrow! Prayers and peace for all, Kathy",

Many talk about joint pain after Neulasta - I did heed their advice and took Claritin for at least 7 days.  Maybe that made me sleep, too.  I'll take a Snow White/ Sleeping Beauty day if I can.   I also suggest documenting SE - I found through my 6 treatments that the SE surfaced on the same days (1, 2,3,etc).  Documenting them helped me prepare for the next treatment. ( things like metal taste days 3 - 9,  itchy bottom, days 4 - 8). May your discomfort be minimal and your support be great!   Kathy",

Be sure to ask for anti nausea medication (it is usually given through IV before the chemo drugs).  I found with them I did not need to take any of the Rx once home.",
