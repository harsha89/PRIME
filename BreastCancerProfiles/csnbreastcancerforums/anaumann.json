      "Content": "I had my drain removed five weeks after masectomy. Now I am having fluid buildup. Dr removed fluid yesterday(4 days since drain was removed) and today the swelling is almost as bad. Can anyone offer tips about what may help. It is uncomfortable especially with a bra. Should I do more or less excecise? The tightness at my incision is like it was soon after the surgery. I feel like I'm going backwards instead of forward. Also I start chemo thursday and my port on the other side -put in 5 days ago, is still sore. ann",
