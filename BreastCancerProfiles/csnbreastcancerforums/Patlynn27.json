    "Content": "I am new to this group.  I was diagnosed with DCIS, stage 0 on 1/9/17.  I am scheduled for lumpectomy on 1/31 and will follow with radiation tx.  Feeling some pre-surgery nervousness.   I am feeling need for support from others.  ACS has made referral to their Reach to Recovery program, but still waiting to be matched with someone. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.  I am trying to take this journey one step at a time.  I am also trying to prepare myself for radiation tx. and gather information about this experience, side effects, etc.",
