    "Content": "Hi Maureen, I had 4 treatments of AC starting last January, and the night of my first treatment I threw up for 12 hours straight, and felt pretty sick for 3 or 4 days after that. I heard about acupuncture to relieve nausea, so the morning of my next treatment I had acupuncture done (my treatments were in the afternoon), and I did much better. I continued having acupuncture throughout my AC treatments, and by the 4th one I didn't throw up at all and I was eating the next day (a huge improvement). After my AC was finished I still would get treatments every so often to boost my energy level, and it also helped a lot if I was feeling anxious. I finished all my treatments in Aug and I continued with acupuncture for a month or so to help the energy level. I would highly recommend it if you can find a good practitioner. I became totally convinced when I went in for a treatment one day after I had had no appetite for a few days and was feeling very anxious, and after I was laying on the table for about 20 minutes with the needles in, I became famished, and I went home and ate like a pig! It really settled my nerves and stomach! Good luck and let us know how it goes! Lisa",
