      "Content": "Three opinions, three ideas. I had DCIS and IDC in one breast. Both of these tumors were tiny, 0.2mm, and 0.3mm, node neg., clear margins. I don't think they were checking for vascular involvment, because I can't find that in my path. report. Had two oncs., and both said \"no\" to chemo. The big difference here is age. And, since I am older than you, I didn't get chemo, no herceptin, but did get an AI. I agree with what someone said here, and that is because of your age, I'd lean a little more towards chemo. I really wanted HErceptin, but because I had a mastec. and no chemo, there was no Herceptin. 8 weeks is not to late, your doctor will ask for your decision when it's time. Whatever decision you make, you can't look back. You'll drive yourself nuts....you have to know that YOUR treatment is right for you, and believe that you will once again be fine. Here's to hoping that you get your answers quickly. PS--SUSAN, I absolutely LOVE your attitude!! That's the picture I'm striving to paint!",

Here's something to make you feel a tad better, I HOPE: A friend had to go onto dialysis, and after a period of time, her kidneys were able to take over, and she wasn't on it. Could it be that they just need a \"rest\" from all the trauma of chemo? Here's hoping that the meds do kick in, and that whatever the problem is is quite short-termed. (((Lolad))))) Jennifer",

I am thinking that when I finish Femara, I may get an ultrsound on that side. Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe no. My pcp has said that she will do any scan I wish for. Gotta love her! By now, the deed has been done, and you are a little more at ease. Here's hoping for good results! Jennifer",
