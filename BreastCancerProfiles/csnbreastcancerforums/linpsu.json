      "Content": "Jean - my eyes were very watery and were often glued shut when I woke up in the morning. I thought I had pink-eye but came to learn that it was a result of the chemo (A/C and Taxol). I read on here that the drippy nose was because there are no longer any hairs in our noses to keep the mucous inside the nose, so it all dripped out. Made perfect sense. Too bad the doctors never told us that. Linda",

      "Content": "Maddie - I came home with a wonderful camisole from the hospital - I loved it! It was soft cotton and opened up the front with velcro. It had pockets inside for the drains. It was kind of bulky b/c of the fabric and velcro, but I just wore loose fitting shirts over it that buttoned up the front. I never would have been able to get anything up over my head (left side mastectomy and 18 nodes removed). It was so comfy that I wore it long after I needed it - several months actually to sleep in. It had a puffy form inside that you could take stuffing out of if it was too big. Later when I needed to go back to work and wear nicer clothes and was having radiation,I switched to a nylon-Lycra type camisole. That one was much smoother to wear under clothes, but it was a slip-on style. As I had (have) trouble with arm limitation, I would slip it on feet-first rather than over my head. Other than for about one week when my radiated area was oozing (I wore a man's cotton t-shirt then), I wore that camisole all the time, and am still wearing it 3 months after finishing radiation, even though I have bras with prostheses. My insurance covered the camisoles and bras.",

Then 2 years later (last Feb.), I had a recurrence under the mastectomy scar. This time, I had chemo first (4 A/C, 4 Taxol), then surgery to remove the implant plus more tissue and 14 nodes (1 positive), then 28 rads. This is a great site to learn about what others have experienced. Obviously, we are all different, but we are all willing to share what our own course of treatment has been. Hugs to you! Linda",

Vet is recommending that we euthanize him before it gets much worse. He doesn't seem to be in too much pain yet, but vet is afraid he will go into seizures and it could get ugly. He is not eating, is very lethargic, and has an awful cough. If we knew he was in pain, we'd have it done sooner rather than later, but can't bring ourselves to do it quite yet. This has been such a horrible day, to know that his life is in our hands. How do we know when it is time? I am crying just writing this, I am so upset. Linda",

Today we all wore green clothes, accented with leprechaun pins, green sparkly necklaces, shamrock bobbly headbands, socks with shamrocks on, etc. The \"leprechauns\" come to the classrooms while the children are in the gym and mess up the rooms, turning over the chairs, scattering toys and books, and hiding gold coins (chocolate) in their shoes (which the children have taken off and left in the room, as per the leprechaun's secret note (part of a treasure hunt). There are tiny green footprints in the halls, as well as green glitter, for the children to follow for the clues. All of the kids make leprechaun traps out of shoeboxes and various other items - some of them are quite intricate and imaginative - candy for bait, trapdoors, ladders, strings that pull down the box when (if) the leprechaun goes into it for the bait. The treasure is a large pot of gold (lots of chocolate gold coins). I think St. Pat's Day is my favorite holiday at Preschool! Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the leprechauns put green food coloring in the toilet tank so each time a child flushes, it is green. They think the leprechauns peed in the toilet before they left!",

Most food tasted awful. Taxol was very different - no digestive problems at all, however the body pains were awful. Vicodin was extremely helpful though. I know most people get Taxol every week for 12 weeks, so they don't get as much drug at once, so hopefully that will lessen any side effects you may get. Like another poster, I had very teary eyes, but on both A/C and Taxol; mouth issues (helped by a special prescription mouthwash), and burning hands and feet (mostly on A/c, but continued on Taxol). I'm having some neuropathy with Taxol. I've had 3 blood transfusions due to low hemoglobin (8.0 and even 7.4 one time), but that was on both A/C and Taxol. Hopefully you will breeze through Taxol! Good luck to you!",
