She was told if the treatment didn't work, she had only approx. 6 months to live. Fast forward to today, she is happy and healthy - no recurrence.

But, I truly believe that everything happens for a reason, even if we have no idea what that reason might be. I know I have such a different outlook on life than I did before and I appreciate all the little things I used to take for granted. I also believe that God doesn't give us more than we can handle, although sometimes it does seem like it's way too much to handle. You have such a wonderful positive attitude - keep fighting with all that you have! I second your Thank You to our awesome Pink Sisters, even with wonderful support at home, the women here are awesome...they just \"get it\" and have been a Godsend to us newbies. Hope your 1st day of chemo went as well as mine did last week. Keep us posted. Hugs, Debi",

Even though I know it was much stronger than over the counter - I have no desire to ever see it again! Hugs, Debi",

I had the choice to have additional surgery to remove more nodes or just to leave them alone and let chemo and rads do their job. I opted for surgery - had 13 more removed last Friday. Figured I'd rather be safe than sorry. The additional nodes were negative, but I didn't want to take the chance - wanted to fight it with everything possible. Wishing you the best with your decision. Hugs and Prayers, Debi By the way, I also was scared about being \"deformed\" after my lumpectomy, but have to say I am very pleased with the results - it's barely noticeable.",
