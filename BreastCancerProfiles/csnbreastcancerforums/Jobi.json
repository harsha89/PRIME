Even so, I was able to take my A/C drip without a problem. It was just a pain in the butt. I have been dabbing it with peroxide and keeping it covered since, because when my clothes rubbed against it, the wound kept reopening. I hope this helps!!! Dorene",

      "Content": "Hello dear friends.  I must first apologize for not getting on this site in a long while.  Even so, you have been in my thoughts - especially Linda.  I am saddened by her news. Since I last visited, I finsihed chemo, got a divorce, started writing a book, and bought a new house.  My battle with cancer however did not stop.  Almost a year to the day of my initial diagnosis, last November I found a lump in my left breast (my right breast had been removed a year earlier).  I went through worries and tests and it was nothing.  In March, it happened again.  I had to make the decision to remove my breast.  June 13, of this year I had my breast removed.  I had tissue expanders put in, and that hasn't been a walk in the park.  They are painful at first!  The pain got so bad that I literally could not get myself out of bed; a friend had to help me.  I think I only have one more office visit before setting the next surgery date.  I just can't wait for all of this to be over.  I will keep you updated.  Jobi",
