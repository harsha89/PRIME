      "Content": "Oooh, I know just how you feel about being clausterphobic. I will never have an MRI unless they give me IV Sedation! I did have a CT when I was hospitalized but it was the abdomen, the machine was an open donut and it didn't take but a couple of minutes and I was pretty sick. I've only had chemo and no rads but I have thought about if I ever do that I would have to take a ton of Ativan to get thru it. Which brings me to my suggestion, before I have any procedure (including a port flush) I take an Ativan cause I'm relaxed. Maybe something like that would help get you thru. Your center sounds wonderful and that will be a help. If this is the first time you cried, you needed it. It hits me every once in a while that I'm a cancer survivor and although I'm thru with treatment, I'll never be thru of \"it\". I've cried 100 times and more. Only a couple of times a real boo-hoo but lots of tears. It's a great release and nothing to be ashamed of. We don't get extra bonus points for not showing any emotion so when the mood strickes, let it go and come on this board and we'll all give you cyber hugs. Keep everyone posted with your progress... Hugs, Judy :-)",

Interview, reference check, network with friends cause maybe someone knows of a good surgeon, the whole nine yards. You can't do both chemo and reconstruciton at the same time (as far as I know, I didn't have reconstruction) so you have plenty of time to find someone. You have to live with this doctor's work a lifetime. You are having to process a lot of info and decisions in a very short time, you are doing a terrific job and you bet you are scared. Just slow down and take your time and don't let anyone rush you. We are all here ready to listen and wish you well with your decisions... Hugs, Judy :-)",

I had it buzzed about 3 days later. My hairdresser left about 1/4 inch. I also had C/T chemo. Yes, my head was sore and hurt just before the hair started coming out and after I had it buzzed it stopped. It was actually a relief to get it buzzed. I felt I had faced it, conquered it and was ready for the next hurdle. Everyone is different and there is no way of knowing if you will be like me or have it start falling out in clumps. If it's like me you can wait til Tues., if it starts big clumps have your friend buzz you. It's a big step, but you can do it...remember, we are pink warriors and can do anything! Hugs, Judy :-)",

I'm finished with chemo (Dec 11) and now that hair is over half inch long (a few are about 1 1/2 in. and are sticking up, looks kind cool)and it's a thrill to feel it and be able to see it. Other new hair has startded to grow but is barely there. If you still have hair you can use a lint roller to take away the loose hairs but maybe some may stay. Give it a shot.

My biopsy report after my mastecomy came back no cancer cells found in remainig breast tissue (Sentinel Node biopsy earlier was clear nodes). Yes I had chemo, C/T. Why? It was not a difficult decision, I wanted to do everything that was possible to prevent a recurrence. You just said it yourself, possible a rogue cell broke off and is going thru your bloodstream...well, that's the whole purpose of chemo, to kill any cell floating around somewhere. If you skip chemo, you skip that chance of killing rogue cells. Because of my biopsy report, I did not have to have radiation. If you do not have a good rapport with your onc...get a new one. You should have a great relationship and trust. Thee are so many wonderful, caring onc's out there and it's important to find one that meshes with you. For me there was no choice, I wanted to do everything that was humanley possible to kill this beast and not have to someday regret my decision of not doing a treatment because there is a recurrence. There are no definites and if it recurs, I will at least know I did everything possible. Chemo is a small price to pay for health. Cancer makes you much sicker than chemo ever could. And chemo made me sick but it's over and the hair is growing back. I hope you can find an onc you have faith in to help you with your decision. Hugs, Judy :-)",

I used the shampoo and conditioner but only used the Folicle Booster in the area that was thinning. Are you going to use it on your whole head? But now my hairdresser has me using a product called Enjoy. It's a shampoo, conditioner and \"stimulator\". The stimulator is a foam that is used after you are out of the shower and towel dried. I have been using it for about a month on the top of my head where the hair is slow coming in. It seems to be doing ok and I have lots of new growth. My hairdresser started using it on customers last summer but I didn't bother cause I was going to be getting chemo. Enjoy is a little cheaper than Nioxin. Are you going to use it all over your head or just in bare spots? When was you last chemo? Keep me posted on how it works for you. I still have Nioxin from last year, I could always switch back.

My surgeon and onc just automaticaly give me a copy before I can ask for it. Both docs spend a lot of time going over these reports line by line. I raced ahead of my surgeon on one biopsy and read on the second page I was a Triple Negative. I don't mind being asked the same questions, although I don't have to pull out my ins. card in the hospital cause they have it on record. But the Driver's License is a must to prevent insurance fraud and someone getting treated using your insurance. I am happy the doc pulls out his steril marker and initials the area to be operated on..no wrong breast being removed. I am happy in pre-op I was asked my name by everyone giving me drugs..don't want some one else's that could give me a bad reaction. Same with food trays, go ahead and ask away, what if I have food allergies and I'm given the wrong tray? I'm pretty sure much of this is to protect themselves against lawsuits but in turn in protects me too. It's frustating and miserable for us because we are scared of the procedures, afraid of possible more pain and hate having this horrible disease and having to put our lives on hold for a while plus all the other aggrevation we go thru and then we have to put with some clown asking the same stuff over and over. I hate just having to go thru all of this I am trying to cope and understand why it's done. Grrrrrrrr. Hope it get's better for you and will soon be over. Hugs, Judy :-)",

I will be happy to finally have the mystery solved of how much chemo etc. But of course am scared to death. I am hoping the mastectomy pain won't be much worse than the surgeries I've had so far, the reexcision took out a huge amount of tissue. I feel so enlightned hearing first hand from all you wonderful people, it's easy to get the facts online, but you guys are wonderful. What are these scarves?

I'll bet there is no such thing as a new question or thought posted here that hasn't been posted many times before. Some of the ladies here that have been here for several years can probably back me up on that. In fact I have a new thought/worry that popped into my head a few days ago, I've discussed it with my surgeon a couple of days ago and will discuss it with my onc when i see her next month. But I'm going to post it here to see if anyone has expereinced it. In the meantime, keep gargling, the antibiotics and whatever you have to do to get well and let us know what your doc says tomorrow. It seems our thoughts (and imaginations) always run way ahead of our normal thought process about this and it's probably a good thing because it keeps us on our toes and asking questions, which is a great thing because we always have to be watching out for ourselves. Get some sleep tonite and let us know, Hugs, Judy :-)",

I first felt the lump, June 6, 09, my first excisional biopsy, July 6, re-excisional and Sentinel Node biopsy, 8-3 and mastecomy on 9-11, no MRI and Triple neg IDC, Grade 3, very agressive and I was fine, nothing grew (of course it was removed with the first excisional biopsy) but what I'm trying to say is your tumor grade is low, you'll be ok. You're probably right they are going to want to wait until that infection is gone. Waiting is sooooooooo hard. But it will be ok. Just concentrate on taqking care of the thrush. This may be a little delay but you'll get there. Many of us don't have MRI's and a week or two is not going to make a big difference or no difference at all. Talk to your surgeon tomorrow and she will tell you the same thing. Good luck tomorrow and keep us posted. Hugs, Judy :-)",
