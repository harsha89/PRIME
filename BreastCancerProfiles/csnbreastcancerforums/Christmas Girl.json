I'm simply impatient, and don't want to take the time to actually learn the more advanced stuff. I can (just barely!) work the DVD player; but, was much more proficient with the old VHS. However, when you start talkin' IPOD - honey, I'm right there WITH ya! (I just don't \"get it\" - any aspect of it, whatsoever!) And, you are weaving a magic spell to fool your loved one into thinking you're using it? HA HA!!! Too funny! Yes, I use postage stamps, too. And firmly believe there's nothing quite like a handwritten letter or personalized note card via \"snail mail\" - especially nowadays, when mailboxes are stuffed full of never ending bills and way too much unsolicited junk mail. Pay my bills online?!? WHAAAT??? Are you kidding me? And put myself out there for some nutjob to steal my financial/credit identity? (This may be an irrational fear - because not sure ANYBODY would want it!) Of course, the cell phone. Gotta love TEXTING! No Facebook, MySpace, Twitter... Nope, none of it. Just here. Our safe zone. Our special place of TLC. Kind regards, 12/25 (a/k/a Susan)",

      "Content": "Honestly, I did not watch the program. But, via other (credible) news media - I understand that her situation is very dire, terminal. Which, of course, is very sad. It always is when cancer cannot be beaten back into submission. Your reaction is totally understandable. Personally, I try to avoid stories like this - actually, ALL sad stories, of any kind. I won't even watch a movie if the family pet passes on. I figure I've had enough real sadness in my own life - I don't want any in addition, if I can at all help it. There's enough that happens that I simply cannot avoid... Yes, cancer is horrible - beyond horrible, really. And, it certainly doesn't discriminate. But, we ARE survivors here - all of us. We are amongst the fortunate ones. Each morning brings another day of survivorship. And although the threat of recurrence looms, when I find myself getting a little too \"crazy\" over that fact - I tell myself there are risks all around me, every day. Each time I get in a car, an accident is possible. Every time I walk the dog in the forest, a tree could fall on me (or her). Depending on where we live, natural disasters are a threat: tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, earthquakes... The list goes on and on. Nevertheless, we don't stop living. Because life goes on. Time moves forward. Fear is paralyzing. I try very hard - and, admittedly, some times it's not at all easy - to allow myself a \"moment\" to ponder; and, then let it go. As if it passes through me, and away from me. This is just my way. And, it took me a long time to figure this out for myself. I hope you're feeling at least a bit better today, Ohilly. I'm thinking of how you recently volunteered to reach out and help a new BC patient with her journey. I was so touched to read your post about it. And as a fellow BC survivor, so proud of you. What you're doing is a perfect example of living for today, and for the future. Making a real difference in someone else's life. Kind regards, Susan",

The worst possible. Thank you for your commitment to this group. I believe it's important & encouraging for us 'old timers' to be here. Inspires hope, which we all need to survive.

Sunday - Celebrated my Dad's 80th birthday with family. This Week: Friday - Adjustments, marking (permanent) & simulation #2. Saturday - 35 Years High School Reunion. Didn't attend the 10 & 25 Years - committee couldn't find me (nor many others). The internet has made a big difference for this one. Should be fun. :-) Sunday - ACS Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk for awareness & fundraising. The one cancer-related event I vowed - long ago - to participate in each & every year, as long as I'm able. This year, I & my little group will register as \"Team Moopy23\" - in memory of my dear & precious friend, Lisa. Next Week: Monday (the 17th) - Rads treatment #1. It is what it is. Am now anxious to get started, in order to finish. And just in case anyone is wondering... Openly & honestly... No, it's certainly NOT \"easier\" to face this a second time. At least, not for me. I've been a cancer survivor for 8+ years. Haven't yet quite adjusted to my new status as a two-time cancer survivor. And am constantly reminding myself that this could've been so much worse...

You are utterly amazing. dear RE - Your heart is so big it's hard to believe your body can contain it. zah & dear RE - Your survival of recurrences provides me with hope I simply did not have before I knew you both. So, thank you. Kindred Spirit - Our journeys and their timeframes are so very similar, I feel as if we walk side by side. Thank you - my pink sisters, personal heros, role models.

Because that is the title of her own homepage here, which I first read long ago - and only once - but never forgot: I Will Not Be Broken. It got her through her first battle - I will hope, and pray, it will get her through this one, too.

In other words, your words: does the \"may\" outweigh the \"may not\"? Or, vice versa? Surgery alone may not \"buy\" you the 13 years you mention.

Claudia has little time left here on earth - several days, maybe weeks. At this time, she is not using her phone, nor the computer. Normally, I do not 'speak' for others. In this case, I have permission from a very close family member to communicate Claudia's status. They ask for privacy. And for continued love, support & prayers to be sent Claudia's way. They understand how much we all love her - and how much she loves all of us here. And it means a lot to them. I know how I feel, many here feeling the same... I cannot possibly even begin to imagine the overwhelming sadness being experienced by her beloved Reggie, Siobhan, all of Chen's family, those closest to her. And Claudia, herself. She's been fighting, so hard, for her life. For so long... Claudia had been undergoing chemo for two years... I lost track of how many different protocols, there were many. None were competely effective for all her mets. One worked on this; but, not that. Another worked on that; but, not this. It's been a long & difficult road. The chemo took its toll on her 'general health' - now, the cancer overwhelms. Despite her upbeat, as usual, online posts (though increasingly less & less frequent), Claudia has not been doing well for quite a while. Her 3-year-old granddaughter, Aliyah, has been a bright light for Chen. A loving & snuggly little girl. Just a few weeks ago, Claudia & Reggie welcomed their first grandson. My heart is not merely broken - it's shattered into a billion tiny pieces.",

So, only your own doctor can provide your own personal statistics (based on your DX, stage, etc.). Me, for example: am now almost 9 years out from first DX. And I remain at 20% risk of recurrence, which is where all treatment (surgery, chemo, rads, oral meds) got me. That 20% risk does not begin to diminish until 10 years - after which it'll reduce by only a fraction of one percentage point annually. Am currently 54 years old; therefore, will remain at relatively high risk for the rest of my life. Again - this is different for each of us. Kind regards, Susan",

We should never, ever measure ourselves - in any way - against our beloved BC sisters. 5+ years since completion of all invasive treatments (lumpectomy, chemo & rads) - I still tire very easily. And when I exert myself - it takes much longer to recover. Specifically, am not tired all the time - my complaint is what I describe as stamina. I have very little. Lack of stamina has been my consistent complaint to my onc over all these years, and his consistent response has been: \"It's better than the alternative.\" A gentle reminder, certainly not a sarcastic comeback. Lingering/permanent side effects, the meds... a combination thereof. Yeah, I was \"ticked off\" for a long time, too. But now, and further out from you - I've simply learned to accept and adjust accordingly. Wish it wasn't so, yet it is what it is. And by the way, I do take very good care of myself - exercise, nutrition, etc. ... Just being honest. Kind regards, Susan",

Not mincing: cancer is a lethal disease. Left unchecked, untreated, it is deadly. It pains me to type those very words - because this close-knit group has lost three members over the last several months. Trish, Heidi, Lisa. All were esteemed warriors. Fought hard - without guarantee. Personally, I'm still grieving. Deeply. And there are many - like Meena, Libby, MamaG, Kari, Chen - who are, once again, fighting - yes, fighting! - to survive. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, tests, oral medications, etc. are the weapons used. The beast, the damned evil beast, warriors, princess warriors, pink princess warriors, the pink sisterhood, the rollercoaster ride, the journey/path, holding our flashlights at the end of the tunnel - this is our language.

Following surgery, my risk for mets was 60% within 3 years. Chemo reduced that risk by half, to 30%. Rads decreased the risk by another 10%. Therefore, following all invasive treatments - my risk was brought down to 20%, where it remains nearly 8 years after DX. The oral meds I continue to take \"hold\" me at that 20% risk level. We are all different, and our decisions are ours alone. However, if something comes along that would help me reduce my own risk by even just another 1% - I would do it. With best wishes to you, Eva.

A bit of good news for you, Linda, was long overdue. :-) Yet, I am also very sorry - heartbroken - for all that you're facing. Sincerely wish it wasn't so. However, as many of our always caring and wise members have already written - I hope you find the inner strength to continue to fight back with everything you've got and every medical treatment currently available for you. Although I've not experienced a secondary cancer/mets (at least, not yet) - like Moopy, I live with a very high risk. My own 20% risk for recurrence/mets does not begin to diminish until 10 years after original diagnosis - which was now six years ago. I sincerely hope that our supreme warrior sisters here who've experienced more than one bout with cancer, of any kind - like fauxma/Stef, RE, Jeanne, and several others - help to instill the same hope for you as they do for me. And,yes - no matter what your journey entails, nor how long it may take to travel... We will walk beside you, each and every step of the way. You are not, and never will be, alone. Not as long as you are here with us. Sending you my heartfelt hopes that the coming new year, though difficult - no doubt, will eventually bring to you good health, steadfast remission.

However, I don't believe it's REALLY \"nothing\" - there's a reason, and sometimes we just can't identify it. You're a breast cancer survivor, Lisa - you have darned good reason to cry any darned time you feel like it! It's not a sign of weakness, it's simply a release... I once read that our tear ducts create two distinctly different types of fluids, for three different functions: (1) The tears that keep our eyes moist all the time. Every time we blink, these tears are released to freshly wet the eyes. (2) The tears that \"flood\" our eyes in order to help dislodge a foreign object. For example, a grain of sand on a windy day at the beach. Note: (1) & (2) are the exact same tear fluid, just released in different amounts. (3) The tears we cry. A different fluid because these tears contain stress-related toxins. So, when we cry - we're actually doing something healthy for our bodies! I now look at crying THIS way: it's a SURVIVAL mechanism!!! And lord knows - we here know how to survive! Hope this helps, even if just a little bit. Kind regards, Susan",

I also totally understand the exhaustion aspect of shopping for shoes, specifically. A couple of tops & a hoodie - simple! You know your size, pick a style & color off the rack, pay - outta there! Easy! Joe, you gotta help her. Moopy - you must get to a real shoe store/shoe department where there's STAFF to assist you. Don't go to the \"self serve\" places - too tiring right now. Pick a WHOLE BUNCH of styles, then sit down in a chair, and have the staff bring the shoes to you! Might be good to start with a good pair of walking shoes... Moopy, dear - you really DO NEED a new and GOOD pair of shoes! Especially if you're gonna start walking with Joe & the dogs again - you know, getting out & about a little more. Best of luck to you, as you take this first step (lame pun?) towards RETAIL THERAPY! Then, on to the sofa shopping!!!

I ask because many chemo drugs do NOT cause hair loss. When the time comes, and you're fully informed, only you can make the right decision for yourself. Please remember, though, it's about YOU.

Could've been a placebo (\"sugar pill\") for all I knew. In fact, at one point I asked my oncologist if it was actually \"working\" or doing anything for me. (Of course, it was.) As always, it's important to ask questions & have a thorough discussion with your doctor upfront. And, IF you begin to experience side effects - contact your doctor accordingly. Now, the Arimidex... That's a completely different story for me. Even so, after surgery/chemotherapy/radiation - I'm not going to allow a tiny white pill to end my ongoing battle to fight recurrence. Best of luck to you, Jeanne. Hope you do OK with it. Kind regards, Susan",

You are just beginning your journey. There will be numerous extremely difficult decisions to be made, and lots of waiting for results in between steps. And only you can make those decisions for yourself. Certainly I don't mean to frighten you further: however, of the very few people I personally know of who refused surgery/treatment... None of them are still living, perished from the disease. Cancer doesn't \"go away\" by itself. There are many of us here who are currently enduring/have endured the entire gamut: surgery, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, anti-BC oral prescription medication, etc. ...
