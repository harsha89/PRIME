    "Content": "I finished my 25 3D radiation treatments on 6/9/11. I thought I would get pretty red because I am so fair, but I didn't even get pink! I had no reaction of any kind. I used Biofine a few times, but forgot to most of the time. My doctor even said we'd forego my 2 week post radiation follow-up appt, and for me to just call her if I did get a reaction I was concerned about. She said she had NEVER done that before. She was amazed. I still haven't had a reaction. So you may not. Good luck!",
