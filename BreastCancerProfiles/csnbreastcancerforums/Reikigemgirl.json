I had to have insurance that wasn't paying for all of the copay, a certain income level (don't know what that was)and a diagnosis that fit into their criteria. Breast cancer was an accepted diagnosis. If you have a way to get a fax, they will fax you the info instead of mail it. I applied through my oncologists office. They faxed the info over for me so that it would happen quicker. I also posted these 3 numbers awhile back. They are the ones that my primary care doctor gave me to try. Hope this info. helps someone else. Love and Light, Vicki",

The patients in the doctors office can even see you when they are walking by. No privacy. I want to be prepared with plenty to do too. They are putting benadryl in my cocktail too so possibly I will drop off to sleep. They said I will be there two and a half hours. I am happy it is such a short time, that is why I was only bringing crackers! But it makes sense to eat a hefty lunch. I am also going to take candy to suck on for the metallic taste like someone else suggested. You cracked me up when you said you looked like you were going camping when you got to your doctor's office. That will be me. Did they have extra room for someone to sit with you? In mine, they don't and I am bummed about it. Thanks for the info for us both!! Love and Light, Vicki",

Whoever replies, did your oncologist tell you to take this? I want to have everything in my medicine cabinet, ready to go incase I need it. I have a dreary chemo room to where they don't serve any food or anything and they won't let my fiance come in with me because they don't have room. So guess I am going it alone. I am taking a magazine, a book, a hand held electronic game to play and some crackers to eat so far. Sorry I wasn't to much help but I am feeling the same thing you are going through. We will make it through it, I'm sure!! Love and Light, Vicki",
