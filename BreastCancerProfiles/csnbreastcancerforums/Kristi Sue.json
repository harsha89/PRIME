    "Content": "Hi! My name is Kristina. When I was diagnosed I was not brave enough to reach out. I wish you all the best and hope my story helps you a little. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 IBC in July of 2006. I was 27 years old and has a 2 year old little girl. The first oncologist I saw said the cancer was too progressed and would not treat me, only give me meds to \"keep me comfortable\". A second opinion, chemo, radical mastectomy, more chemo, and radiation later I am happy to say that 3 years after my final treatment I am still getting clean scans. My doctors did not even give me an option at the time of my surgery of having an expander placed. I was too concerned with living that I didn't think to ask about reconstruction at that time. After treatment, when I started exploring the options they told me that the expander could have caused problems with my treatment. So, when I was finished healing from radiation I started looking. It took 4 plastic surgeons telling me they wouldn't touch me due to the extensive damage caused by the radiation for me to end up at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. I was so fortunate to find the BEST plastic surgeon. She reconstructed my breast from my tummy! I have no artificial parts in me. There will be no need to redo in the future, and there was no worry about the damaged skin because it was removed during the surgery. Dont' give up if the expanders do not work there are still options, there are always options. Good luck and keep smiling!",
