But, you will get thru it, as, we all have and still are going thru various treatments. As far as HER2 -, it is best to talk to your oncologist as to what that means and how it will affect you. I am HER2 +, so, I can't answer about what it means. I do wish you the best of luck! Please post and keep us updated on yourself! Hugs, Kristin",
