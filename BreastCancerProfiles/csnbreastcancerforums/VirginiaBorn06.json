    "Content": "I'm so sorry you feel so bad. I had surgery before chemo and believe me the surgery was much easier to take than the chemo, but I was fortunate that I didn't have to have it as long as you did. I can't imagine 16 treatments. I know it's hard to do, but try to remember that this stage of your treatment is over. Be sure to take whatever medication you need to to make the symptoms better. I'll be thinking of you and wishing you better days ahead.",
