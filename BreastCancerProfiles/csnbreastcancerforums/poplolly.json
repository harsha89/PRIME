I think it's important for you to be vigilent when cancer is in your family. As far as self-exam--do that, but what you'll be able to catch with that is something that's fairly large if you have no other symptoms. I'm like you; I was always so lumpy I couldn't tell if I had a problem or not. That was until I found a lump in my right breast. Be in tune to your body; if you feel something is wrong take the time to go to your physician. By doing all the above you should be able to feel pretty certain that you are ok. hugs, Judy",

I discovered that my oncologist talked very quickly and matter-of-factly while I was panicking after her first sentence. I found that her nurse was easy to talk to. I also wrote down everything I wanted to ask and, again, the nurse answered most of the questions. Maybe he didn't literally mean you have cancer in your body now, but that the cancer cells can be other places in the body undetected which can lead to a recurrence. The way it was explained to me was that the chemo would kill quickly growing cells which is what the cancer does, so undeteced cells would be zapped. On the other hand, you may want another opinion or to switch oncologists for one that might make you feel more comfortable. I will pray for you and keep us posted on how this goes... sending positive thoughts your way--Judy",
