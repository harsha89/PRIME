    "Content": "Dear Kathi, I too am so sad and sorry to hear about your daughter. No matter the circumstances, losing a child of any age is a terrible thing for a parent. I lost a daughter (she was 30), too. This is something you never really get over, just learn to live around. You and your family will be in my prayers. -shelley",
