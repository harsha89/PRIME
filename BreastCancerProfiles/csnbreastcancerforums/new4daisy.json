    "Content": "Hi debv,   I am so sorry you are having to make these decisions.  It is extremely overwhelming when you are diagnosed and face so many choices ahead.  I was diagnosed last June  with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  My surgeon suggested a lumpectomy (and I trusted his opinion).  I had the lumpectomy in July.  They did not get clean margins at the time of the first surgery (which happens, I found out after getting pretty upset about it). So, I went back into surgery 2 weeks later to get clean margins. My oncotype took about 6 wks to get results (with insurance approval and all), that was very hard to wait for those results.  It came back that I had a score of 18 which is the lower end of the medium range.  My oncologist (which I also trust) suggested chemo. Her advice was that I want to do everything we possibly can to keep this cancer from recurring.  I did chemo (6 rounds), which I started in Sept. and finished in Jan.  I went on to have 33 radiation treatments and finished that in March.   The only advice I can give is trust those doctors that are caring for you, if you feel they deserve your trust and follow what you and only you feel to be best for your body.  You are so smart to reach out to this website!  I wish I would have turned to it a year ago for support.  I'm sending hugs and prayers your way for peace and strength in your journey ahead.  Blessings to you  ",
