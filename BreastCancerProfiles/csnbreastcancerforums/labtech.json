    "Content": "oh i am so sorry milly. please know your mom is in a better place and has no more suffering. My mother is starting with Alzheimers disease as well she is 80. My sister and i feel fortunate that she is at this age since all her family started in their 70's. I start my second round of chemo on Wednesday and not looking forward to it, i am seeing the docotor tomorrow and asking for the cream to put where the port is so i have less pain. I know how you feel about your appearance, but know this is temporary and we will get through this, none of us feel very pretty when we have to lose our hair but it will grow back and maybe even better. I bought a pretty head scarf and the wigs they have now are really nice. as long as you have support and friends/family you can survive anything. you are never alone we love you. tracey",
