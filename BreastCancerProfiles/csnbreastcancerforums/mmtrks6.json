    "Content": "I just finished 6 treatments of taxatere, the main thing I found with taxatere was the aches and pain that came about two days after treatment, it felt like you had the flu, the other was I had to take decadron before each treatment, because taxatere can make your legs and hands tingle and become numb. I know that it made my toenails all turn black, (I didn't lose them, just look like I was trying to wear black nailpolish.) I do know how you feel about being in a dream world, I had just been to the doctors in July of 2001 and had the normal blood checkup and overall by the onocologist and all was ok, but in September of 2001 I found two lumps one on each breast in new site (I was first diagnosed in October of 1996 with one lump) this time it was also in the lymph nodes. Of course everyone keeps asking me how does it come back All I can say is How is the h____ do I know. God Bless and Take care",
