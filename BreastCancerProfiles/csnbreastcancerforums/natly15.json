I had to let them know that I was a big girl, I had qualified doctors, and I was doing eveything I could to follow all the doctor's expert advice. 4. Be sure to come back here often.

My body reacted adversely to the taxol so they switched me to taxotere. This was done after 2 surgeries. My tumor was small but aggressive and had already invaded the sentinel lymph node. We are all so different and so unique as is each oncologist. So many factors figure in to our individual treatment. Based on age, stage and several other factors my onc deemed it necessary for me to do the 8 rounds. Wishing you the best as you become a chemo chick.",

I had 4 rounds of A/C, 1 1/2 rounds of Taxol, and 3 rounds of Taxotere. I couldnt take the taxol. My last chemo was march 30, 2010. I then had 33 radiation treatments. I was 66 when this all started and now I'm 68. We are all individual with different side effects, treatments and recovery. I just started beginning to feel like my old self again about 2 weeks ago. I'm sure age has something to do with it. I started juicing veggies and fruit in the fall of 2010 and just joined the gym 2 weeks ago. I still get fatigued but nothing like it was. I've noticed that I'm not as puffy as i was when i was going thru chemo. The numbness can last for a while, but you have been thru one of the more difficult forms of treatment and believe me IT DOES GET BETTER IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S TIME. Hugs to you.",

I made heart shaped pink iridescent earrings for each gal and we will celebrate and enjoy each other's company as we share friendship and love. So now I'm forced to get my butt in gear and do some dusting, straightening, and mopping. That is the downside, however an upside is that I have the energy to do it.
