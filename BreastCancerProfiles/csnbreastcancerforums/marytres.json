      "Content": "Hi everyone! Can we stop talking about death and think about living? Yes, I know it's something to think about and that it'll happen sooner or later but better later. Now let's get on with each new day so we can be ready when God calls us to Him. Let's think about this day, Valentine's Day. I wish all of you lots of love, a long life to live and love and may you always be loved. Always. In this world and in the next. Hugs, Marie",

Boy, by the looks of it, we're all in some kind of pain!!! God help us all. I also take celebrex when I have a headache etc. I have chronic gastritis so I have to be careful. Hugs and love to all, Marie",

I can't tolerate zoloft either and want to try St. John's Wort too. My onc said I could but it's mild not strong as zoloft. I'll let you know how it goes. Marie",
