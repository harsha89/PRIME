Just checking in with you baby...  I am 60 now and am a 5 year survivor breast cancer.  I have onco appnt on Thursday as I've been diagnosed with IBS and I think the onco may want to verify that its not mets.  Also it may be time to come off arimidex as its been 5 years.  Life is vey tough for me.  Severe depression and anxiety over my son, my finances and a possible cancer recurrence.  I know my Mom is up in heaven and I will see her and all of my loved ones one day...just not ready to fight again.  Cancer sucks.  Mine was stage 2b, locally advanced IDC, ER- PR+ Her -  I have the gene mutation BRCA1 so have had bilateral as well as hysterectomy.  This cancer was over 6 cm.  Always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Had a bone scan yesterday ordered by my rheumatologist.  The onco will have the results.  Please pray for me that its not time to go through this again.   Prayers to everyone, Sharon",
