Just wanted perspective on others who may be experiencing this problem. As always, thanks for your help. Gayle",

      "Content": "Well the bilateral mastectomy was Friday - minimal pain and only a few lymph nodes needed removal. Initial surgical opinion is very encouraging - will receive path report on Wednesday. Question I have is regarding removing of the drain tubes - one in each side. I had little no pain post-mastectomy - how painful is it to remove the tubes in the office. So far I've managed to use primarily Tylenol - should I expect more? How long does it take the remove the tubes? Thanks for your \"experience sharing\". Gayle",
