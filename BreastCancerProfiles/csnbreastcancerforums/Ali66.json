    "Content": "Good morning all. Newbie here. Â Stage2/grade3 bc with lymph node involvement. i have 2 more of 12 taxol/hercept & perjeta. So far so good. Moving on to AC & nervous about fatigue. Still working with no problems. All nausea meds preordered so I am ready as I can be, just hate the unknown I guess. I am hoping since I handled these 10 weeks so well that I can handle the AC as well. Yes I know everyone is different, but still hoping. Take care everyone & God bless. ali66",
