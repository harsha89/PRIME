    "Content": "Hello All, i hope you all are doing well! I am happy to report that my husband has only one taxol to go! His last taxol is on Tuesday next week!! Oh, what a relief!!  We saw his radiation oncologist this week. He said that my husband is going to have 3 weeks break after the last one and then radiation will start right away. We are super happy!   One problem with him is that he has been having troublw sleeping on the first and sometimes following one or two days after his chemo.  He would sleep for about 3-4 hours during this nights even though he takes sleeping pills. Is there anybody who had same the problem?   He always has sleeping problems as far as I know him. But this one is very persistent and always happens on the first day of chemo.    Thank you all very much. ",
