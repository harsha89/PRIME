My oncologist did say it was aggressive and they were treating me aggressively. They called mine ductal carsonoma.

I thought stage 4 was if they found it in other places besides breast or lymph nodes. I had to wait a month after surgery for more chemo. Then 6 weeks of radiation. The surgeon did give me a treatment plan after biopsy but changed it slightly after the surgery. All I can do is tell you what treatment I got but my circumstances are different. When you go to the oncology appointment maybe you should ask why you weren't told of a treatment plan sooner? Write down everything you want to ask.

The nurse sat and watched me the first time to see if I had a reaction. I did and they had to slow down the drip. So what should have been fairly fast (like an hour) turned into two or three.

I knew I'd also need radiation but after surgery I was told I'd need 4 more rounds of chemo which were Taxotere. I was very upset because I didn't want 3 more chemo rounds. After the surgery I was decreased to 2A. I got thru it and then had the radiation. Radiation was easier but you have to watch the skin and make sure you aren't getting burned. After each radiation treatment ask the doc to check the area. Mine didn't and I got burnt and had to take a break till I healed. When I was on radiation I got very tired.    The way it was explained to me was radiation kills any cancer that is in the surgery site. Chemo kills cancer that is in the body. but chemo doesn't absorb well in the surgery site. That is how it was explained to me.  I went through treatment 2003-2004. I did not have reconstruction and only had one breast removed. They found 5 lymph nodes (it's been a long time and this is what I remember) with cancer out of 15 they removed.     ",

I would feel fine until 30 minutes after and would bearly get home and start throwing up. All the rest of that day I couldn't keep anything in. The next day was better but still nauseous. It would take about a week to start feeling better. I started wearing a shirt that I didn't like to treatment just incase I developed an aversion to it. They must have thought that is the only shirt I had. When I got home I would put on a bathrobe. The problem was I got sick after I got home and had the bathrobe on. It was new but after treatment it still made me nauseous so I gave it to Goodwill. I had other minor problems but I remember the nausea the most. It did with each treatment last longer but also I would think how much closer to being finished I was. I was also very tired and could fall asleep watching tv. I am a five year survivor and lots of the bad stuff is fading from memory. I did like eating Chinese restaurant fried rice. It seemed to make me feel better when I could eat. The oncology nurse told me to eat a cracker or something if I felt nauseous. She said something in my stomach would make me feel better.",

When I get like that I don't feel like posting either. Wish I could wave the magic wand and make everything right. This feeling will pass and you will be all the things you want to be again. Hugs.",

I didn't know about this board at the time and had limited knowledge. I healed fine from surgery. I thought about getting reconstruction a year after treatment but my surgeon had a heart attack and I decided I'd just not go with someone else. Sometimes its hard living with just one but I'm 59 and it doesn't bother me as much as it would someone younger.",
