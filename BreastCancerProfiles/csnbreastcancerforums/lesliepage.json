    "Content": "Many people feel anxiety when they are ending treatment. You're life has been consumed with a multitude of doctor's appointments and multiple treatments, then suddenly it's all coming to an end. It's a scarey feeling, and very normal. And, I understand that it passes in time. I also only have 4 radiation treatments remaining, and I'm feeling a little vulnerable.

In fact, I have an appointment scheduled with one at my hospital. Good luck to you!",
