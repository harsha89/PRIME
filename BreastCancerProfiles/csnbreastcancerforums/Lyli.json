    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 weeks ago. I have always been having problems with my husband, he is an unemotional jerk. The only credit I can give him is that he has financially been supporting me since 1997. But I cannot get this******** to open up to me and reveal his true feelings. He is extremely protective of his cell phone. He goes to Houston every Friday night to to take care of his car business. I could not leave him in the past because I had some other health issues & for financial reasons. We have a beautiful house together & I have been make it a very comfortable home for him, which has made a lot of people jealous. But now i am faced with Cancer . He was gambling when i received the news from the radiologist, i called him he didn't answer, i called him again an hour later he said why am i calling too much. When it was time to go learn about my disease, he showed a slight support . I am still waiting for surgery, I had a bad shoulder pain the other day. I ended up in ER. While I was being treated he went out of the room, he was on the phone with one of my new girlfriend whom has been kinda trying to get his attention . Days prior she was asking my husband to buy her a car, brought $ for deposit,because of this reason they exchanged phone #s. So while I was in the hospital she called him . He says he called her to let her know I was in the hospital. Either way I said the calls shouldn't have happened I needed him to be by my side not on the phone with another women. In any case,Cancer is opening my eyes more & more about him. I got rid of her as a friend & asked her to never call my husband again. I am thinking that I haven't had my surgery & started treatment and he is acting this way ,What will he do next??? I am planning to sell my house & divorce him & move to New York to be close to my family. One of my sister has breast cancer in NY too. I need help making this tremendous change in my life. Please Advice! Lyli",
