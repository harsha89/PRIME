      "Content": "I am with you......same 6 chemo/rads and they want me to pass on tamoxifen and go on to aromasin...less sides effects. But who are we to believe? Doctors have over 10 years of research on Tamoxifen and yes there are sides effects....but aromasin is new....but I haven't seen much on research that I can get my hands on. It is such a tuff decision to make......5 years on this stuff! Tamoxifin or aromasin? Which is better?",
