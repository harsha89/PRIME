      "Content": "I have a friend who had Hodgkins in college and breast cancer in her 50's. Just like jeanmcmici said,my friend also had to have a mastectomy because she couldn't have any more radiation and they wanted to be sure they got it. She is a four year survivor. Go for it and get it taken care of.",

      "Content": "I need help too regarding Femara. I have been on Femara for 1 1/2 years (after 1 1/2yrs on Tamoxifen) and am seriously considering quitting because my joint pain is so bad. I already had some problems with arthritis before going on Femara but it seems so much worse now. I keep thinking going off the Femara will help determine if Femara is the cause of my increased pain or if my arthritis has just gotten worse. On the other hand I'm scared to stop the Femara for fear of cancer returning (I was stage I, clean lymph nodes, estrogen positive,in 2001). I don't want to return to Tamoxifen because those side-effects scared me even more!! I'm so sick of hurting I don't know what to do. Walking is especially bad. I'm 61 and like all of you feel 100 on some days!! I'm open to suggestions!! I see my onc in Nov and want to talk to him about this.",
