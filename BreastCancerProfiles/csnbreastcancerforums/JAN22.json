    "Content": "Dear Hummingbyrd, I found out about COQ10 about seven months ago, when I went to a natural health person ,to find a more natural way of dealing with my cancer, even though I was clear of it after surgery . I found that COQ10 , is a natural form of tamoxifin, and is a (CURE ALL) FOR ALOT OF PROBLEMS , but is NOT looked at by doctors. The two reasons I started to take it was #1 the cancer, #2 my heart, I have mitro value prolaps, and my other health problems that run in my family. Since I started taking this, I tell people about it , and surprizing enough there are alot of people that already knew about it. I guess if we were more into natural health, we would have been on top of it sooner. Natural med's are not excepted by the doctors,and they need to research it better, to inform there people, of alternative treatment. Take care ,and good luck with everything, I hope it works well for you. Lots of love JAN",
