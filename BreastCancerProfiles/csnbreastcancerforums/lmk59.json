    "Content": "Have you had your hemogloban/iron levels tested? Mine had dropped really low when I was diagnosed with breast cancer and then during chemo they went lower. I was really tired all the time. My oncologist had me take iron pills and if that didn't work to raise my levels I was going to have to have IV iron. I'm not quite up to the normal range but am getting there just taking the pills. 2 1/2 months out of chemo.",
