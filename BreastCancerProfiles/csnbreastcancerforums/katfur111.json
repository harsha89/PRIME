    "Content": "im on faslodex and Ibrance, on my 3rd cycle of Ibrance and have had faslodex injections today and this is my 4th, the shots hurt and are sore for about a day or two but nothing crazy, i am very fatigued and nausea is a beast but i still work full time 12 hour shifts at night. Zofran is amazing for nausea and no S/E and i might throw up one or two times when i first take the Ibrance but i feel great on the week off of it. no mouth sores or hair loss . thank you Lord. just fatigue and nausea. good luck.",
