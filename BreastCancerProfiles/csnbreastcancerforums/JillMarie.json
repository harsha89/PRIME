    "Content": "I'm trying to find out the name of the drug that was used for pregnant women in the late 70's who chose not to breastfeed. It was an injection in the arm just after giving birth and it dried up your milk. Seems to me many women, including myself, who have been diagnosed with breast cancer recently had that shot. I'm just wondering why it is not used anymore and if anyone ever did a study to see how many women with cancer received it. Anyone know the name of the drug I'm talking about?",
