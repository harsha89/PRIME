    "Content": "Teri - I've been trying to find someone who is also part of the same Clinical Trial of Ixempra and Avastin! I was so excited to read you posting as I now have someone to talk to who has is having the same experience. I was signed up to complete 18 treatments (6 cycles of 3 treatments), but completed 17 due to high blood pressure and neuropathy issues. Had Ixempra every week for 3 weeks and one week off. Avastin was the first and third treatment of each cycle. I didn't lose my hair, but had a lot of thinning. The tingling/numbness in my fingers and toes was the worst side effect that increased with each treatment. Now that I'm almost 3 weeks finished with the chemo, the feeling is slowly starting to go away. How are you feeling? How has your experience been with the Ixempra/Avastin? Look forward to hearing from you! Hope you are doing well! Lindsay",
