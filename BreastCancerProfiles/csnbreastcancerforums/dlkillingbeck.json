    "Content": "I just wanted to say that being diagnosed with breast cancer is scary however, if you surround yourself with a good team of doctors you can get through it easier.  My cancer was stage 1 with no lymp nodes involved but I had 3 tumors.  2 in the left breast and 1 in the right.  The team during surgery was my breast surgeon, the plastic surgeon and the radiologist.  I was able to have radiation, under the skin, on my right breast so after the breast surgeon was finished with the lumpectomies the radiologist did the radiation.  After she was through, the plastic surgeon rearranged my breast tissue around to make sure that my breasts looked like a normal breast.  I understand, from friends who have had lumpectomies, that this is not always the case and that they have \"dimples\" in their breast.  My surgeon just happens to have a plastic surgeon in his office but if yours doesn't ask about having one there for your surgery.  I can't see that a surgeon would refuse a patients request for that. Also, don't be afraid to get a second opinion.  The oncologist that my primary doctor recommended wanted to do chemo on me.  I was blown away by that because my tumors were stage 1 with no lymp node involvement and they were quite small and slow growing.  One was 1/8 of an inch, the other was 1/4 of an inch and the 3rd was a little over 1/4 inch.  After her recommendation, I walked over to my primary doctor's office and asked for a 2nd opinion referral.  The second oncologist spend an hour with my husband, daughter and me, after his work day was over, and went over every test and lab result with us.  He could see no reason to recomment chemo.  That was a weight off of my mind and now I will be starting the radiation on my left breast tomorrow. We have to be advocates for ourselves and do research for ourselves so that we can not be afraid to ask the questions that apply to us.  Everyone's breast cancer and treatment is different but when we are diagnosed, we need to get out of the fog in our brains and take action so that we can be participants in our treatment.",
