    "Content": "Maureen, I'm scheduled to begin chemo (TC) in about two weeks. I've been looking for an acupuncturist in NH as I've heard that the acupuncture works really really well to mitigate side effects of nausea and pain. My mother has a friend who received treatments the day before chemo and had virtually no side effects. Even my oncologist said that acupuncture is the complimentary therapy that seems to work the best in dealing with side effects. Good luck with treatment.",
