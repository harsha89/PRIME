Even when I put all my make-up on, I still feel like I look weird. I've tried to pencil in brows--I'm not good at it. I've thought of getting fake lashes but haven't yet. With no lashes, there's no way to make your eyes \"pop.\" I'm interested in any advice as well. Hang in there, girl--maybe they'll come back longer and fuller! Renee",

I agree with Doris above--I'm Stage 4 as well and I feel that's important enough to see the doctor and I personally see my oncologist once a month when I have my treatments. It's funny--many of us have the thoughts like you do--could this be my last Christmas? I recently had my first grandchild born in July. When I was rediagnosed at Stage 4 in January of this year, my only thought was, \"Please God, let me know my grandson.\" I am very hopeful and optimistic about my situation, but it's only natural to feel this way. Cancer makes it so you don't take anything for granted--especially time. But, it's hard for our family and friends to deal with this--especially if we say it out loud. But, in our minds, it's there. Glad you came here to talk about it. I'm really hoping and praying that your treatment works wonders, is kind to you and you feel peace and comfort. Hugs, Renee",

The fluid just seemed to keep coming and coming and I was getting mighty discouraged. My surgeon said when I had 3 days in a row with less than 30 ml. of drainage, it could come out. It felt like forever. But as my nurse said, better to leave it in and let the fluid just naturally come out than have to keep coming in every other day to have it drained. It's now about 4 months past that time, and I'm dealing with a fair amount of swelling and fluid still. I'm working with a lympedema therapist to disperse the fluid, so hopefully this will resolve in time. I feel your pain and frustration. Hang in there--it will get better. Renee",

I can only relate my experience--but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I had imagined. I am so afraid of drugs--I think about 20 minutes before I even take an aspirin so the thought of that chemo going directly into my port and into my bloodstream was terrifying. I'm not super religious, but I am spiritual, so I decided to just totally put myself in God's hands. And, you know what--he took care of me. The infusions went very well. A few days later I had periodic diarrhea/constipation (for which there are many remedies), most foods tasted pretty yucky, and I had some bone pain and body aches from the Neulasta shot which I had the day after chemo to raise the white count. My hubby came to every chemo. We usually talked, laughed and carried on with the other wonderful people who were in the same boat. I never vomited from the chemo--ever. I was pretty tired out with the last 2 treatments and since it is cummulative, they were a little rougher than the first 4, but all went well. I got through them and you will too. You sound like an upbeat, positive girl and that will help so much. When people offer their help--take it. They need to do something--let them feel loved and useful while they nurture you. Rest when you can, eat whatever you can tolerate (my onc. wouldn't let me eat any fruit or veggies raw that couldn't be pealed to try to avoid any food-bourne illnesses)and know you can do this. Please check in often--with any questions, problems, reports or just to say hi. Hugs, Renee",

And, in my opinion, it's wrong for any of our medical professionals to give us a time line. Also, when we hear \"no evidence of disease\" it's really just at that moment--during that scan. The very next day--one little cell could change everything. Being that there's no cure, for me, the best thing has been to try to live in the moment. As Doris has said here, we Stage 4-ers are very happy to be living with the \"stable boy\"! Hugs to all, Renee",

Not seeing the sun for days at a time can really affect your mood. I've been on an antidepressant since I was diagnosed--back in Dec. of '09 (Zoloft). I've thought about letting the doc begin to wean me off it, but we've both agreed to have me on it a little longer. I've done really well on it--most days I feel pretty darn good. I don't know if that would change if I go off it or not. I've also been on the Arimidex since July of 2010. I feel I've had a few minor side effects with that--a little joint pain especially in my feet/ankles/knees once in a while, and not much of a sex drive. But, I also know it's imperative (to me and my onc.) that I'm on it. Sue--I really hope you get to feeling better soon. Good luck with that doctor's appointment and the lab tests. If you need a nice long weekend in the sun, consider yourself invited to see me in Phoenix! I'd love to have you. Hugs, Renee",

I'm gonna put this under the category of \"life is too short to worry about calories\"! I can rationalize just about anything! This sounds so yummy. I'll just have to try it. Hugs, Renee",

Since my port was removed 18 months ago when treatment finished the first time, I am now portless. Chemo sure was easier with the port and my good arm only has only puny little vein. Has anyone had a port put back in? Does it go right back in the same spot? I discussed it with my surgeon and he said he would definitely do it for me if necessary. Just curious to see if anyone's had to be \"re-ported\"! Hugs, Renee",
