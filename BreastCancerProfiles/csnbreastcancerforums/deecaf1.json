    "Content": "Hi there....well, you all have heard the story of my \"jigglers\" and how I finally have an awesome prosthesis! Well....I should have \"listened\" to my surgeon and not rushed it....I didn't consider three months rushing it....however...after only a week with my new cool awesome prosthesis I am in PAIN!!! Started hurting a bit here and there and then YEOWWW!!!! Had to get the darn thing off right NOW! So, I'm letting my new cool awesome prosthesis rest in the fancy box it came in and I'm \"letting it all hang out\" so to speak! I always was a slow learner. However.....you won't hear about me telling my surgeon I did this....no way! I don't have to see him again til June and I'm planning to be better by then. It's bad enough listening to my husband tell me....\"He told you so!\". Anyway, have a great week....just wanted to share my latest adventures with you all. God bless,Dee",
