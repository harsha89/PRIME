      "Content": "Dear Karen, I had taxotere for 4 cycles. My oncologist suggested rubbing them with tea tree oil morning and evening before bed. I also had to take a Vit B suppliment for the nails. I also had the hit with the hammer feeling. I did not loose any nails during the chemo only after did two come off, but not short enough that it was a problem. I also was told to polish the nails a dark color, whether to hide the discoloration or to block the sun light I am not sure. God Bless. Sandy",

      "Content": "bunnie, my hair started coming back in February just peach fuzz. I finished chemo in August. My hair was long enough by about end of June. That is when I went with out the wigs. It came back very gray and boy was I shocked. My friend told me to get some Loving Care. I did die it one time a temporary color, but since then, it is back to my 'normal' color. I am almost 43 so gray was not what I wanted. I havenot gotten it cut yet, waiting for my birthday and going to go and have the works done. Hopefully by then it will be long enough to style. I heard that tamoxifin causes hair to grow in slower, so maybe that is what is happening to me. Jesus bless you. Sandy",

Well a year of chemo and radiation later, I am here to say that I am probably better now than before. I am eating healthier and started exercising. I have 4 kids too, one just starting college at the time of DX. She was able to be home for my surgery and take care of me. What a blessing. Husband was pretty good too. Just take it one day at a time. If you have made it to 3 weeks you can do one more, then before you know it you are finished. Will be praying for you. Sandy",
