    "Content": "Some history. My mother was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1988 at the age of 47. She had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. She was diagnosed the second time in 2004 (age 63). It was not a recurrence but a \"new\" cancer in the same breast as before. Treatment was a mastectomy only. It was caught early. Fast forward to June 2011. She noticed a hard lump on her chest right in the middle. This turned out to be a recurrence of her cancer from 2004. She had scans done that was negative so it did not spread. She went through intense chemo once every 3 weeks for about 4 months. Then surgery. We got a copy of her pathology report which showed clear margins BUT a small tiny piece remained. 0.08 cm. I was surprised that the chemo didn't take care of it all. She is now having radiation daily for 5 weeks. What I want to know from her oncologist is due to this bad news, what is her prognosis? I am going to ask at her appointment in January. She has always be a strong person. She is my best friend. Without going into a whole other non related story, she is my reason for living. Literally. When she goes, I am going to have to also. Sorry for the book. I am just super stressed and worried. ( I am on anti-depressants and anxiety medication) Have been for 20+ years. Thank you for reading. Any thoughts on my mom's situation would be appreciated.",
