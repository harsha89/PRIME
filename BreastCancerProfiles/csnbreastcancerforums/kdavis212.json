    "Content": "Oncoligist wants me to do 6 rounds of chemo, but said he would be happy if I complete 4. I have completed 4. When I asked him why he wanted me to do 6, he said there have been studies showing benefit of 4, but would like to see me do 6 on the concept more is better.....not sure I think that is a good enough reason to continue? Â  Also, surgeon suggested that once I have mastectomy (which I am having hard time getting head around) that reconstruction is fun...WHAT? Did anyone feel it was fun??",
