      "Content": "I am with sherria49. Had my bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction on 10/30, went home the next day. Sure wish I would have stayed that extra day in the hospital. I felt like a truck hit me. I have 2 drains. They better come out tomorrow. I needed a lot of help getting out of bed. I acutally felt better when I was in the recliner. The first week I was in a lot of pain. Each day is getting better. I am not doing Thanksgiving....",
