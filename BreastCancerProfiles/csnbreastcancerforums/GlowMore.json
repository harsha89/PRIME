My Surgeon told me that if it was only one tumor...and if it was under a certain size that the statistics were showing that the survival rates were the same with lupectomy vs masdectomy overall.    I was a Widow so my choice was not because of cosmetics..........but simply because of his recommendation looking at the statistics.  Went into it hoping that it would be only lumpectomy and then radiation.........but it had spread to the lymph nodes so had to do the chemo.  Early in the process I decided I COULD NOT live in FEAR.........so I let it go and took it all one step at a time and so far I think that God has given me a Miracle.   However...I still worry and still pray it won't show up some other location. You are in the right place for sharing and caring and learning...........we all understand.  ",

UNTIL I began to have a rash underneath the saggy one & the cream for it costs $40 a tube.... YUK    So after a lot of years I found a bra that worked...it is the Bali Revolution and is stretchy itself and has a very thin pad which covers up my different shapes and the nipples that are in the wrong place.  I found this bra at a store but then ordered the rest of them online.  I hope you can find a solution and so sorry for your pain.  Prayers for strength and courage.   Glo         ",
