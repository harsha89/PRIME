      "Content": "I have had chemo before surgery. I finished 12 weeks of Taxol last week. This week I start FEC for a total of 4 cycles. Today I was told the tumor is responding. However on yesterday the surgeon says a right breast mastectomy is my best option because of the size and location. I will be tested for BRCA. The surgeon says if BRCA positive I should have a prophylactic mastectomy of the left breast. OMG. This is so overwhelming even though it was expected. I will have my surgery in January. So, now I am freaking out. Not only one breast but possibly both. My mother had breast cancer at 41 so I am pretty much convinced I have the BRCA gene(until proven otherwise).I am ready and willing to go through with the surgeries I need to fight this disease. But, I have anxiety about how I will react to seeing myself without a breast(s).",

      "Content": "I am so tired of feeling bad. Chemo changes your body. For me it feels as though my body is no longer my own and dammit I want my body back. My last chemo was 2 weeks ago a total of 16 treatments. I am tired of nausea, vomiting,constipation,hypersensitivity to smells, and bad tastes that linger in your mouth. Now the next thing is surgery followed by radiation. I will have a right mastectomy on January 13th. I will be traveling 2 hours away to Houston,Texas for surgery. The day before surgery I have to have a lymphoscintigraphy (ouch).I am so tired of going through all of this. I know I have to but it is so draining. I am nervous about surgery and my body is just tired. It is great to have people tell you things are going to be OK but that's easy for them to say. They have know idea what I am feeling.Cancer sucks!!!! I just need a break from all of this but unfortunately its not an option.",
