The fatigue has been diminishing each year, this year was actually the best year for me since I finished chemo and rads in '07. During the summer, I never work for more than 2 hours outside (in years past, it was much less, so this is a sign that I am becoming healthier). :D Some of the things that I have done while at work: Like a couple of you, I would get a large cappichino before and/or after work. The problem, or course, with this idea are the calories (a few extra pounds, ugh) and the caffeine effect for when I want to go back to sleep; taking several breaks, if you are able to sit down at work, and still be productive; a warm bath right after work to help me to relax; small meals and energy bars, or protein water, as needed during the day; and nibbling during the day (trying to eat healthy foods to munch on between classes). I have gained some weight, but that's probably due to the caps :(. Since I did not have the option to quit work (I am the main provider for my family-hubby is on SS), or retire (I am late starter), I knew I had to find a way to stay employed. It hasn't been easy, but sometimes things in life simply don't come by easily-who would know that better than us! Good Luck. dmc",

Since it takes about a month, as per my understanding, for the meds to leave your body, when I return to taking them I have just finished cleansing my system. Of course, this means more years on meds. My onc has also suggested every other day, but my memory is so bad that I doubt if I would be able to remember if it's an \"on\" day or an \"off\" day.

      "Content": "I have what is called, Factor 5 Liden. It's a tendency towards blood clots and it's genetic. Anyway, I had two clots prior to bc, one during chemo, and one after chemo. The one during chemo was caused by an overdose of Neulastin. My former onc, I quess, did not believe me when I said I react strongly to meds. He prescribed to much neulastin and my white blood cells in my leg coagulated and caused a clot. As for warfarin, kin to coumadin, I did not respond effectively to it. Yet, when I prescribed coumadin, I reacted to it and had to stop. While pregnant, when I had DVT also, I was given heprin for six months. Now, to reduce the chance of a blood clot recurring, I take an aspirin daily (when I remember, I'm really bad about taking my daily doses). The challenge with blood clots are two-fold: one is reculating the meds. If you find that you are bruising easily, call your dr immediately. It may mean that you are taking too high of dose. Two, once you've had a clot, your tendency to have another is increased. It doesn't mean that you WILL have one, it only means that you now need to take precautions. Precautions such as: don't cross your legs, don't sit on your legs (I still do this and pay for it later), don't be sedendary for long period of times (even sitting on the commode for a long time can cause a clot). While on meds, I'm sure you were told, don't take a multi-vit that contains Vit-K (most vits have K in them, so be careful), don't eat leafy greens, green tea, or another other foods with an anti-oxident in it or Vit K. This is another reason I stopped the blood-thinners, as a vegetarian it limited what was I able to eat (then, take away the soy I started dreaming about soyburgers! That's another story). Also, stay off your leg. Hints: When I started to walk again on it, I used a cane on the opposite side of the clot, this allowed my weight to be on the cane and not on my leg. I slept with my leg elevated above my heart (it's not the most comfortable, but I made do). Lastly, ask about a compression sock. Your insurance should cover them. They are not very attractive, but they are another precaution. I used these prior to buying some that were a bit more stylish for work. Even now, 3 years since my last clot, I wear compression socks if I am going to be doing a good deal of walking or activity (I buy them at Walmart and they look like dress socks, but just thicker). Keep yourself hydrated. One of the compounded causes of having clots is the lack of sufficient fluids, as well as inactivity. 5 mgs is a considerable amount of blood thinner (but, if I remember correctly, warfarin required a higher dose than coumadin because it's a generic). I would consult with your dr about the dose and be sure that you need to take much. It seems like over-kill if you are also giving yourself shots (I assume heperin), but I'm not a dr. Oftentimes, the drs start the meds high to act quickly on the clot, then cut it back. I think I would ask. Blood clots are scary, but if they are kept under control and monitored closely they are easily cured. Hope this helps. Sorry you have to go through this, too. dmc",

I'll try to remember to start another thread so it will be easy to find. Good luck to all of you soon be on chemo and to all of you who are scheduled to start in the near future. I do remember that, while I was at chemo, I drank a lot of water with ice (sucking on ice supposedly helps reduce the occurance (sp? never could spell this word)of mouth sores--it must have worked because I didn't get any :). The water, of course, keeps you hydrated--a common effect of chemo. I took food to eat (a picnic lunch really) to share with my driver/friend, because I knew that I would eat little to nothing for days afterward. I didn't have excessive pain from the Neulasta shot, but was given too much (I'm very sensitive to meds and prone to clots) and it caused a blood clot. Make sure the effects of Neulasta are monitored closely. That's all for now, until I get some info from my dr on Monday. dmc",
