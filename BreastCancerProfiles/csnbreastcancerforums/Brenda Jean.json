      "Content": "Hi Mimi I am new to this board but have been reading for over a month. Thank you so much for the info on these beautiful scarfs. I just hung up with Lisa ( Not Laurie) and she was very helpful as well. I was dx in June with triple negative and have already done the lumpectomy, MRI's and today I had my port put in. Tomorrow I start chemo. I am anxious to get it started. I will have 4 mons of chemo (AC then T) every other week then 4 weeks off then 6+ weeks of rads. Everyone on this sight is so wonderful and I hope they know that there are a lot of people reading like me before I felt comfortable joining in! It has really helped me learn so much and emotionally has been a god send. Thank you as well as all the other wonderful women on the board. Brenda",

      "Content": "Hi Mimi, Zeeza, Pat, Aurora and all the other strong women fighting the beast! I am happy to report the I had my port put in yesterday and completed my first round of Chemo today! It went very well. My nurse George at the Rozwell Cancer Institute in Bufallo, Ny was fabulous!! He really put me at ease. My oncologist met me first thing to go over the procedures and give me a hug!!! The best part of the day was that I also had an appt with the genetics clinic to get my results back. They came back negative--- the best words I have ever heard. I lost my mom and grandmother to bc and one sister dx 5 years ago is doing well. All I could think about was my children - daughter 21 and son 18. Now it is time for me to beat the beast! And I will! One complication to all my treatments--I am a Type 1 Diabetic-- can not have all the steriods June 24 dx bc July 21 lump lymp nodes- 2 neg, 0 pos -- tumer size 2.7cm, clean margins, Triple Negative Stage 2 grade 3 Invasive ductal Carcinoma left breast Aug 13 port placed Aug 14th Day 1 of Chemo Plan -- 4weeks of Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and Cytoxan Then 4 weeks of Paclitaxel (Abrazane) Then 4 weeks off then of to Rads for 6 1/2 weeks Mon-Fri At this point I hope to be filling my dance card with NED!!!!!!!!!!
