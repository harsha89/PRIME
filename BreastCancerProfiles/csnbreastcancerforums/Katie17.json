    "Content": "Hi - I was diagnosed with DCIS a few weeks ago and am scheduled for a double mastectomy next week. Although the diagnosis is DCIS, the area is too large relative to the size of my breast to do a lumpectomy so they have recommended a mastectomy. Because I am not looking to do a big enhancement, the plastic surgeon has given me an option of either having the reconstruction all done during the same surgery or having it done in a two-surgery procedure with expanders over a course of 10 weeks. She is advising me to have the expanders and second surgery because it will give me a better cosmetic outcome. Obviously, I would prefer only one surgery but feel that I should go with her recommendation. Has anyone had either of these surgeries and recommend the pros and cons? Does the two-step procedure make the recovery time a lot longer? I have two young boys (9 & 10) who are active and am trying to figure that in to my decision as well. Very nervous as I am sure you can all relate to! So appreciate any advice! Katie",
