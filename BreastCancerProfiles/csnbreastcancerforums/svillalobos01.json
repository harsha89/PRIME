    "Content": "Hi, when I was doing the chemo, I only had to have the shot the last two times, both times my nurse suggested I take a Claritin D pill like 30 min. before the shot. My body still hurt but it could of been worst without it, I don't know. For the nausea, I took EMEND, it's 3 capsules, you take one before the chemo and then 2 more the following 2 days in the morning. Besides EMEND, my oncologist also prescribed ONDANSETRON for the nausea, I only needed one extra pill every cycle. Make sure you ask your dr. about these medications, they worked great for me, but you know that every system is different. EMED is very expensive, but my insurance covered it. It's not going to be easy, but you so are gonna make it. I am all done with my treatments. My life starts to feel kinda normal again. Take this journey day by day, you soon will be at the end of it and most important of all, do not loose your faith, that is what kept me going and the support of my family and friends. Don't even bother thinking that they are doing too much for you, they do it because that is probably the only way they can show you their love and support, so take care of yourself and just do what your body ask you to do, rest. Keep your energy for all those other treatments that are coming, as i said, it soon will be all over. Anything else you need, we are here for you.",
