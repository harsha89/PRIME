      "Content": "Surprisingly, I've always looked at other women's breasts because I've always been small chested. Yes it's been envy! I only had a cleavage when I was nursing. So...I had a double lumpectomy, on the smaller breast and now, I'm very lopsided and very conscious of it. I know it doesn't measure up to those of you that have had mastectomies but that's where I'm at. I went down 2 bra sizes after going through several different types etc. Oh well! I guess I've got to get used to it like everyone else. I'm better about it than I was early on. Thanks for listening! Karen",

      "Content": "I am 3+ months out from my last chemo and I was feeling my neuropathy had decreased since I started Gabapentin a couple of weeks ago but it has gotten worse in the last couple of days. I have slowly increased my dose like I was instructed. I added a pill this morning and we'll see if this helps. The Gabapentin has dramatically improved my sleeping - it had been ages since I slept as well. Has anyone else had their neuropathy increase suddenly. If so, what helped? The pain can take my breath away - it's a sudden shooting pain in my hands - particularly, my right hand. I've been having a hard time cutting my food and writing. Please help! Thanks for listening to my venting and your help. Karen",

Our sons and daughter-in-laws live in the Chicago area and due to jobs won't be able to come a see me. But the excellent news is that we're anxiously waiting for the very soon arrival of our first grandchild - we're just waiting for the call! Needless to say, we can't wait! We'll be headed to Chicago when he makes his appearence. My heart overflows! I hope all you mom's have a blessed day! Karen",

Real caring people understand. We all get what you're going through - bone tired, no sleep, nauseated... We're all a visit without the hassle. Also, you can't possibly keep up with the house cleaning - try to not let it get you down, other things are way more important! Rest up and remember this is all about you right now and your needs. Hugs! Karen",

      "Content": "I had my second lumpectomy about 2 weeks after the first one due to narrow margins - I was pretty disappointed to be going back in for more surgery but I wanted to do whatever I could to get rid of any possible cancer cells that might still be there. I had Triple Negative Invasive Ductal Carcinoma - Stage 1 and grade 3 - so my cancer was a different kind than yours. Our situations are different. I had chemo and radiation too. I did everything I could to eradicate this menace from my body. I hope the best for you and know that you're in my prayers! Karen",

      "Content": "Welcome to the sorority of people who know what you're going through or at least, have an inkling. I know you would rather not need to be here but none of us would either. I also am a TNBC. I was diagnosed last June (2011) and am on this side of treatment. What an experience!! I found AC to be the most difficult on me physically. It depleted me! I have to say Taxol wasn't as bad but I was exhausted all the time. Antinausea meds and pre-treatments meds got me through. I am so grateful to whoever came up with all of them. Radiation was no big deal, as far as the treatment went, tho I had skin problems and huge fatigue but I got through. I'm so sorry your family has been going through all this. It seems so much harder to see other ones we love go through these issues too. I hope you know we're all here for you. Don't be afraid to share your situation with us - we are all ears and feel better if we can help someone else. Prayers and hugs! Karen",
