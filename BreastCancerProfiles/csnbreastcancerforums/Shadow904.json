    "Content": "Hi Scarlett, I've been on Arimidex for a year now and I too, am experiencing joint pain (lower back and upon waking, my feet). The lower back is constant but I am now learning to tolerate it. I exercise (walking/dancing) and take supplements, fish oil, glucosamine/MSM, VitaminD, and eat healthy. It is very difficult and at times I just want to stop taking these pills. I figure, if I made it thru AC chemo, radiation, two surgeries, I can do this if it will help to prevent recurrence. My Onc suggested an injection of Zomeda, for the bones, but I refused; VitB6 will also help. I don't want more chemicals in my body; so I chose supplements, and lots of Kale, broccoli, dark greens! I know what you women are going thru; I also had neuropathy in the hands, but that disappeared after about 3 months of being on it. Stay strong and believe me that having a healthy diet is huge in counteracting any side affects from these drugs. Take Care and God Bless.",
