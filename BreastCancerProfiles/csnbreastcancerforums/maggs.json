I think it is something we should be able to talk about, since it is unavoidable for everyone, anyway. I have side effects from each drug I take, AND my markers are slowly increasing...chemo almost killed me, so I might be running out of options unless I want to risk it again. Is there anyone out there who is not afraid to die? What do you believe about it, or have experienced from the death of others? I know it is a difficult thing to talk about, but I don't think we should be afraid to support one another even in the face of death. Our society really doesn't talk about it much...",

I am not as concerned about my appearance as other women because for six months or so I didn't wear a bra at all, and I think I shocked a lot of people without even realizing it because I was so grateful just to be alive! Sometimes I still wear a slightly smaller, less expensive lightweight prosthesis and if it is a little off, well, I wear loose-fitting sweaters and tops anyway! Hope this helps!",
