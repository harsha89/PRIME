      "Content": "Hello! Not sure if you have already contacted me, you've left us no name... just in case it wasn't you... *grin* It's a personal & individual decision to make. I know happy and unhappy people with trams and implants. I chose the Tram as I was uncomfortable w/the possibility of rupture, w/having to potentially have them replaced in 10 or so years (according to my plastic man)- though now I read Iris' post and see that's not such a big deal.. I just didn't want to be cut into any more than necessary after this initial surgery! I was hesitant to use silicone (as the fluid or as the \"packet\" itself) because my immune system was already compromised in college after a bout of Chronic fatigue/Epstein-Barr. I also worried about having a foreign body in me and it's potential effect on my immune system. Oh! one of the deciding factors for me was the fact that the Tram gains and loses weight with you. It's your fat in there. Seeing as I was weighing more than I wanted to before surgery, I didn't want to end up with my natural breast losing weight with me and a turbo-boob that it would never catch up with. My remaining breast was well-loved & well-used thru' breast feeding and I knew if I had an implant, I'd be very lopsided (I am a \"b\" cup, rolled up!) and again, I didn't really want an implant in the remaining breast to even them out... So.. TramFlap it was. I had a single mastectomy immediately followed by a Tram on July 22, '02 (this summer) The whole thing, including installing a port, took 6.5 hrs. The first 2 wks out of the surgery I was a very unhappy person. I hated being waited on, being needy, being disabled. I wasn't mentally prepared for that. I wasn't prepared for the stretch marks (they are fading beautifully). I wasn't prepared for temporarily losing feeling down my midline! I wasn't prepared for being a patient. I am a caregiver by nature! Silly me. It's been nearly 3.5 months now. \"Babette\", my Tram, is doing well. There are odd things, she's a wee bit bigger/fuller than the original. After chemo is done, I'll have a bit of fat taken out. I had a spot of fat which died (necrosis) which will be removed at the same time. I know, I know.. more cutting which I was trying to avoid.. *rolls eyes* Life goes on! I am comfortable with the tram now, we are great friends, we go everywhere together, she listens to all my deepest fears and such... It's natural to the touch, it moves like my other breast and in all, it's nice to have a very flat stomach... I am glad that I chose it! Go with what you feel most comfortable with... I had trouble deciding until I had all the information I could get my hands on. As others have and will say again- be comfortable, ask questions, go with the surgeon you trust! Research them!! A good plastic man/woman is worth their weight in gold! Feel free to contact me- zenhound@cac.net ... Be well, take care, have fun! Marty in Michigan",

      "Content": "Hello Chris, Well, I did not have to take Tamoxifen as I was not estrogen positive... It is my understanding that after having ER+ breast cancer one is not the best candidate for pregnancy as pregancy is reliant on estrogen and ER+ breast cancer is also reliant on it... that is why one takes drugs to suppress the estrogen. When I became pregnant- not at all expected nor planned, I called my Onc. who immediately asked me if I had been ER+, when I said no, he said he gave me his blessing. He told me that earlier the same week he'd counselled 2 other women who'd been ER+ against pregnancy... Of course, this is current thought in the medical field... things may change at any time but... Have you contacted your Oncologist yet to ask about this? Please do a goodly amount of research before you attempt to get pregnant. I know that several years ago during my own surgery/chemo. my husband chose me over our first pregnancy. Be realistic, be well informed and follow your gut a bit as well. Hopefully you will receive more guidance. Be well, ~marty",

      "Content": "Hello! I was 37 when I got the diagnosis (nearly 3 yrs ago now) Well, I never did wear a wig. Rarely I wore a hat or bandana(when I got cold, my adventure was through fall & winter). Of course, I should say that I have been known to give myself a buzz cut or colour on a whim.. college and high school throwback I guess. *smiles* My attitude has always been \"it's just hair, it'll grow back.\" Of all times to be invited to weddings, which is very rare for me, I was invited to 3 while bald & yellow from chemo!! I found some lovely liquid eyeliner in shades of purple to go with my outfit and drew spirals all over my scalp. It was rather nice, really! When my hair started growing back in after the chemo, it was fine, thin, fluffy and grey. My normal hair had been dark brown, wavy and thick. We shaved off that precursor hair and soon my \"real\" hair started coming back in, as thick as it'd been pre-babies, dark and curly, with a few greys for highlights. Again, no hats or covers and I too had rave reviews for my short 'do. Compliments from complete strangers who had no idea that I didn't cut it that short, it was my \"chemo-cut\". By the way, it stayed wonderfully curly 'til I cut it off at shoulder length. I buzzed it off for the summer post-chemo and now it is growing back in with a bit more wave than I had pre-chemo. For me, being bald was an opportunity to talk to others about what was happening with me, to show them that I am not (too) scary. *smiles* We only go 'round this time once, have fun with it! Enjoy! Do what makes you happy and comfortable. Take care of you, inside and out! Be well, ~marty in Michigan",

      "Content": "Hello Marilyn! I had my sub-clav port removed while under general anesthetic. Told the surgeon that I couldn't cope with feeling or hearing anything! *wink* Having it on my chest, just below my left clavicle, I have a horrendous scar now. That area moves much more than one would suspect... The Plastic Man even revised it (Oct. '03), the revision is no better- stretched horribly as well. It has (hopefully) ended up 2.5 inches long & wide, red and puffy. The sensitivity of the scar is calming down now, after months... Most people get the port in the upper arm- if you happen to have a sub-clav, be sure to keep that area as still as possible. Wish I had known in advance... but hey, I look at it as a war wound. Rather shocking when seen in an open neck, etc.. but something to remind me of what I've gone through. *shrugs* I've never heard of anyone else mention and pain after removal.. surely you will be fine! *smiles* Facial hair, as others have said, will likely go it's way and your energy will return. Suddenly, one day, you may realize that you feel great! I personally felt better than I had in years- the cancer had been quite a drain for some time. Life is good. Best wishes and celebrate your port removal on Friday! Be well, Marty",
