      "Content": "Last weekend I woke up with a fever and my chest had turned red and purple around a burn I received during the first surgery. Nobody knew how I got the burn in the middle of my A week ago yesterday, I woke up with a fever and saw that my chest was becoming red and purple - particularly around a burn I had received during my first surgery right in the middle of my chest. I had asked all the residents and the nurses how they thought I got burned on my chest but no one knew or would cop to doing it and now it was infected - cellulitis. I called the on-call doc and he told me he thought I had to go on IV antibiotics. 9 hours in the ER and four more days in the hospital. Finally they decided to send me home with cepro (oral antibiotic). I took two doses of the cepro and broke out into a rash. I've never been allergic to an antibiotic but I guess my body had had enough. The doc just said stop taking them. The next morning I woke up with blood all over my shirt and sleeve. About 1 1/4 inches of my surgical site had opened up and was leaking all over me. I called the doc and he gave me the option of putting a bandage on it and seeing him Monday morning (this was this past Saturday morning), or going back to the ER. Really??? I decided on the first option. Fortunately we have a very good friend who is an OR nurse. She put me back together and sent me on my way. I saw the doc this morning at 9 and he thought it looked good. He told me that he thought the cellulitis caused the tissue to weaken - hence the split. Seriously??? I didn't cause the cellulitis in the first place - they did by burning me in the operating room. Sometimes I get so frustrated by the measures they go to for CYA. (sigh) The good news is that I'm home, feeling pretty ok, and looking forward to healing completely so I can play in the garden, spend Easter with Andie, my children and grandchildren and enjoy this beautiful spring. Actually I really am a lucky girl. Hugs to all Pam",

      "Content": "I am just recovering from invasive Loblular Carcinoma - stage 4. I had it 27 years ago and now again. I had 9 months of chemo and then a mastectomy. I feel truly blessed because the margins were very wide and clear. The chemo worked wonders and I feel great. I had a second ductal carcinoma 17 years ago and had a mastectomy and reconstruction the same day. Had I known all this would happen I would have had a double mastectomy 27 years ago. But things were a lot different then than they are today - we have much better treatments today. Just do the next right thing. Breathe all fear and anxiety out of you - every 5 minutes if necessary, and share as much or as little information as feels right with other people - any other people. This is all about you and you get to make your decisions with your husband and whomever else you want on this journey with you. God bless you Pam",

Andie and I had an invitation to go to the Cathedral of St John the Divine in NYC - one of my favorite places in the world - to the annual Paul Winter winter solstice concert. It was an amazing experience. We will have Christmas Eve at my daughter's and Christmas Day at my son's. I got to take my three granddaughters shopping for their parents and then my three grandsons went with me this past Wednesday. The boys did notice I wasn't as energetic as usual but they seemed to be happy to be with me. I am truly blessed this Christmas. This last chemo treatment kicked me a bit. Two more and I think I'm done. Then surgery. But not today - today it's all good. Merry Christmas and Happy Hannakuh to everyone! Pam",

I have stage 4 recurrence lobular breast cancer but I just can't think about the number. I wake up every day and each day I feel better because I'm off the chemo and on the anastrazole. and for that I am grateful. You are one of the people who gives me hope and inspiration. I will keep you in my prayers and in my heart. Take good care, Pam",

      "Content": "I just celebrated 25 years of continuous sobriety December 11th - coincidentally Bill Wilson's AA birthday. I was not sober the first time I had breast cancer 27 years ago. I was sober the second time 17 years ago and I cannot say enough about what a different and more positive experience it was. Alcohol is a depressant and I didn't need to be more depressed or anxious than I was. Also I knew that alcohol and drugs lower the immune system and I sure didn't need that. I also have to say that each day I know, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that I want my sobriety more than anything in my life because, if I didn't have it, I would lose everything I so dearly cherish in my life - family, friends, work I love, and most of all my connection with my Higher Power. After my mastectomy 17 years ago, I didn't want to take pain meds. My doc told me that if I didn't I wouldn't heal. I did take some home with me but the first time I took one and felt stoned, I threw the rest away, and switched to Ibuprofen. That worked just fine. If you haven't been to AA, try it. If you don't believe in a Higher Power, use all the energy in the \"rooms\" as your high power. Overall my pink sister, you have to want your life and your sobriety more than anything else. You deserve both. Love, Pam",

      "Content": "Last night my lungs started to burn. I didn't have any asthma because they were dry but I still couldn't stop coughing. I was really surprised because I'm still on 50mg of prednisone. I call the onc doc today and he called me back saying I may be reacting to he chemo drugs. He's only seen this happen about 4 times in his career where it affects the lungs so badly but it does happen. We thought we'd wait a few days to see if it cleared up but it's worse tonight. He wants to do a ct scan and see what's going on - then probably switch the drugs. I can only imagine what he'll come up with. I think I'm really a little scared but I trust my onc doc and my breast surgeon so we'll see what happens tomorrow. One day at a time - sometimes one hour at a time. Anybody else have reactions to chemo where they had to switch out? Thanks for your input and support! Pam",
