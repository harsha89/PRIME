    "Content": "well my girlfriend found out today she has infilterating ductal carcinoma. bilateral masectomy awaits. that means both breasts, right? i've read about \"invasive\", but not \"infilterating\". what the hell is that? tomorrow is cat-scan, bone-scan, and blood test. find out friday if it has metastisized. but, they said she's not a gone-er after all, though. whew! starting chemo tomorrow, also. so you see, we are just starting the adventure! thanks all for listening. eric",
