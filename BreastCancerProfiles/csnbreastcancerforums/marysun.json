    "Content": "Hello all. I saw my surgeon last week for my 6 month followup. He said \"see you in one year\"!!! So he is pleased with my progress. The soreness at the surgery site(s) that I complained about was deemed to be within his expectations and he allowed that it might be sore for a while longer. We discussed lymphedema and he certainly made it sound that very few patients developed the condition. I know 2 ladies who said to me \"I wasn't careful enough\" when talking about their lymphedema and they both wear full arm compression sleeves. I had 21 nodes removed and of course I am concerned about the lymphedema. I am wondering if anyone else has had problems with lymphedema. I myself have had no symptoms, but it is just one more thing to stress about within the Big Cancer Picture.",
