      "Content": "I say lets start the New Year off right - in UNITY - This sight has been a blessing to us all -giving us a place to explore different options allowing us to share all of our highs and lows-Communicating with others going through the same things,checking out how others fair through their treatments and/or trials.This site should remain just as it has been ,an Open Forum.We are all intelligent enough to know right from wrong,and act accordingly. When I originally came to this site it was to look for CANCER INFORMATION-thus it is at the top of this page,I just stumbled on to the DISCUSSION BOARD. I'm so glad and thankful I did-my gratitude is inmeasurable. Right now my Sister is going through ovarian cancer,this is her 2nd battle with cancer,so besides checking things out here I jump to different DISCUSSION groups to find information,get support and/or give support.I sure hope we can stay as we are -I would really miss everyone and all of our freedoms of communication.It really would be a shame.

      "Content": "Dear Bunnie, I have to agree with everyone else,unless there is a medical reason for you not to make the trip I say go for it.How often do you have the opportunity to take advantage of a trip like that.My husband has been to vegas I haven't but with a city that goes 24 / 7 arrangements can be made to accomadate all.Besides I'm sure your husband ,your sister and brother-in-law will understand breaks for rest when needed.Alot of fun and memories will be there for the taking,so ease up on yourself,take it one day at a time and get plenty of rest between now and then---and stop worrying,that will take alot out of you in itself.Save that energy for Vegas!! May God bless you with peace of mind and a heart full of joy and happiness.",

      "Content": "It's sooo hard to wait-a gazillion things go through your mind.On top of everything else you are going through right now - so much pain..I too had the AC but only 4 ,no radiation(had the radical mastectomy)I finished in January this year.I still have problems with my lower back and lower ribs,they've ran test-couldn't find anything.So I figure it is something I have to live with???I don't know,but my heart goes out to you. My onocologist told me that the treatments that I recieved could cause another cancer to surface later-I love how they wait until you're half way finished to let you know this.I had specificly asked about this before I started to no avail everyone I talked with acted like they had no knowledge of this.I guess it's the lesser of the two evils,if I hadn't agreed to treatment and it came back I would've felt like I didn't do everything possible to survive and be with my children and husband,the Dr says the chemo probably saved my life-this could be true-who knows.I guess we make the best decision we can under the circumstances-please try and keep your spirits up,be strong and take extra special care of yourself and try and find things to occupy your mind.You are never alone ,I hope everything comes back pleasing for you--keep us posted!",

Take comfort in Your faith and cherish time spent with her. I will keep You in my prayers and remember our purpose is yet to be.God Bless You! ((hugs)) Sue",

      "Content": "Dear Penny, I'm so sorry to hear about Your Mother!My heart goes out to you all.I don't know why things happen the way they do,one thing for sure is that once You have cancer - the chances for reoccurences are higher,with or without chemo.We all just try to do the best we can,make the best decisions possible with the information available.As for the chemo---while it's in there killing the cancer cells unfortunately it is also killing off good cells too! Your total immune system takes a big hit-making You more suseptable to a whole array of infections and bacterias that under normal circumstances we would even flinch. There are alot of medications out there to help bring things back up-neulasta is one,I can't think of any others at this moment but there are several. You should talk to the Doctor,actually when they do blood work they should know this. I've never had that combination of chemo (I had a/c)but they are all chemicals,thus not anything normally put in our bodies.Be sure when she goes back to the Doctor to make a list of all of Your concerns.If Your Mother continues to not tolerate this combination well the Doctor should either come up with something to make it better or if it gets bad enough to switch to another combination.There is no doubt that chemo takes its toll on our bodies and mind-sometimes we have to look at the bigger picture,at what is at stake.Your Mother is still with us,that means there is a purpose that she has yet to fill.Take Good Care of Her-and be good to Yourself too!Cancer takes its toll not only on the one with it but the family,friends and the caregivers.There are many Ladies here who have been through this more than once. Their strength and wisdom are abundant.My thoughts and prayers are with You and Your Family.",
