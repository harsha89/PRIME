A diagnosis of cancer, or the fear of one, is what puts us here. And we all share the good and the bad and the ugly. Whining is permitted here. Worrying is accepted here. The only rules here, as far as I can tell, are: 1)honesty, 2)compassion, and 3) unconditional acceptance. So...........no apologies are necessary. With love, Debi",

I know that doesn't help much, but just know that there are many here, including myself, who hold pity parties regularly, and who are holding you, with love, in their hearts. I hope things start improving for you. The suggestion about asking for help is also a good one. Sometimes people just don't realize how much you need them. And sometimes they're afraid they're \"bothering\" you. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Hoping for fast improvement in your life, Debi",

I am going out to walk my dog in a little while, along the Swan Trail which runs along the Swan River which is starting to swell and rush with spring run-off. Even though it's a bit cold and dreary today, it's still a beautiful day with budding trees, lots of robins hopping around, and daffodils in bloom. There's new snow up in the mountains. There's a lot to be thankful for. Enjoy life! Hugs, Debi P.S. I am only at the very beginning of all this -- surgery is still 11 days off. I am sure I will learn a lot more before all this is \"through\" (although I guess it's never totally \"through\"). Thanks again for all you do here, Moopy and Aortus,",

Althoug I am lucky to have a wonderful sister, my mother died of cancer 20 years ago, my stepfather is useless, my Dad is toxic, and my Uncle is all about \"I hope you get better because you have to take care of ME....\" My half-brother went on a tirade about how I HAD to go to the Cancer Treatment Center of America when I first got my dx, I set my boundaries explaining it was my body and I had to make my treatment decisions, and I haven't heard from him since... I have also been the caregiver and compassionate family member (remember the discussion we once all had about the fact that all of us here tend to be that person in our family???). Personally, I best express myself in writing, so I send letters or emails explaining how I feel to people/family members whom I can't seem to get through to in any other way. I get to go over and edit the words, make sure I'm expressing my feelings in the best possible way, and I can go back and see exactly what I said after the other person responds. You're not a *****. And you are entitled to your feelings. But you need to feel them and then move on so that they're not hurting YOU. Have you ever heard the expression, \"Resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\"? Much love and compassion, Debi",

      "Content": "Mike.... So far you have not been diagnosed, and yet you are jumping to surgery and follow-up treatment. You need to start at the beginning...all this other stuff is a waste of time and brain energy. 1. Go to your family doctor (as Jadie said). 2. He/she will either: a) send you for a mammogram, or b) send you to someone who knows more about male breast issues; 3. When you get the results of the mammogram, the radiologist will decide where to go from there, i.e. a)is it something suspicious that needs to be biopsied, or b) is it something benign that you are needlessly worrying about? 4. If the radiologist decides it's suspicious, then he/she will get you to the ultrasound tech, and then they will decide whether or not to biopsy what's there. 5. THEN, if the biopsy comes back as carcinoma, you go talk to a surgeon. Right now, and for the past several weeks, you're just worrying about possibilities. Stop worrying and start acting on the things you need to do to follow through with this. It's time to sh*t or get off the pot, as some would say... Practically speaking, Debi",

      "Content": "I'm just wondering if any women on this board, or even Bill, had to wait 16 days to get a first mammogram on highly suspicious lumps? Also, I looked back at your posts from earlier, Mike, and you mentioned awhile back that at your Relay you had met some other male vets who were bc survivors...surely, since they have been through the VA system already, they might have some ideas, right? If it were me, Mike, that's where I'd start looking for more specific support. These guys live in your area, are vets, and are bc survivors. You can probably find out more from them than from anybody here, simply because they have been through the system and have come out the other side. We all know this is a great place for support and love, and it is given freely by all. We have all been through, or are in the middle of, bc experiences. But one thing we all do for each other, as well, is give frank advice (remember the woman with the daughter who was bleeding from her nipples?). And there have been other people here who were either procrastinating or wondering what to do with a close friend or relative. We have all been very blunt and straightforward when it has been necessary. I believe, Mike, that you should use ALL of your support options. This discussion group is one; the ACS resource centers are another HUGE place to go for information (cancer.org); and your new-found vet friends would seem to be THE most supportive group of all. All I'm saying is, use what you've got at hand. And, again, wait for the mammogram, then the diagnosis, then the ultrasound, etc., etc. This whole journey is about one step at a time. Hang in there, and don't jump ahead of yourself. Debi",
