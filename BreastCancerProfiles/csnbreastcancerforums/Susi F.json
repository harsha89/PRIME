    "Content": "You'll both start feeling better soon. It's a shock to suddenly lose a part of your body.  I felt like everybody was looking at me after surgery.  I have a vest that holds breast shaped pillows on my chest that helped me to feel \"normal\" again.  Check with her oncologist's office for resources.  There's a lot of help out there. I had a friend tell me that it isn't one person that has cancer it's the whole family.  Your \"job\" will be as hard as your mothers...as you both focus to get her healthy again. ",
