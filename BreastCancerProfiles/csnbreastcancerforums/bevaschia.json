    "Content": "Good advice from everyone here.I didn't have expanders.  Bilateral mastectomy.  I stayed one night in hospital.  Could have gone back to work immediately, but opted to just rest a few days.  Took vicodin pain meds for at least two days per the doctor...but then switched to extra strength Tylenol and it was adequate.  Drains were in a week and a nuisance but doable.  Removal of drains was a piece of cake for me pain wise.  On no pain meds now.  Things are just numb.  Had to wear a compression bra for two weeks, didn't care for that, but they said it was a necessity so I followed the direction.  I was really surprised that the entire surgery and recovery has been relatively easy for me.  Worst part was having to sponge bath for a week---advised no shower until drains come out.  I wore zip up sweatshirts, but have good range of motion.  Good luck to you.  You can do this!  Please keep us updated.    ",
