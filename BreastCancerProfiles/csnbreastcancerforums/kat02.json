      "Content": "Tara, I am SO VERY GLAD that you finally found a doctor to listen to you. Many doctors just don't realize the agony of waiting not to mention the fact that you are sick and need to start an appropriate treatment plan. I am sorry about the colonoscopy prep. I must admit that I hate it more each time I go through it. Stay strong and make your doctors listen. You are in my prayers. Laura",

      "Content": "Tara, I don't know what I would have done without sites such as NCI or the University of Pennsylvania Onconolink. They have provided invaluable information that my doctors often don't have time to provide. I also have found the more controversial information beneficial. The information that I have discovered has enabled me to be more informed when I meet with my doctors. This in turn has opened up more treatment options for me. The web has been very positive in my experience. I am thrilled that I found this support group in November. I was not physically or mentally up to attending a support group. This online support has been amazing. Doctor's never fully prepare you for treatment or surgery. After my surgery when I was having difficulty with my drainage tubes and various sensations, I found this site. I asked for help and received almost immediate support. It was incredible. Since then this site has provided me with inspiration to keep on fighting. Everyone here is amazing. You can't receive support like this from any other sourcs. Best Wishes with your presentation.

      "Content": "Hi Grandma, You are in my thoughts and prayers. I was wondering how your first treatment had gone. I have a terrible time eating. Nothing tastes right and I feel sick all the time. I have been eating a lot of vegetable soup. I also seem to be able to eat Stouffers \"Chicken ALA King\". I have never been a big meat person and the \"Chicken Ala King\" is mainly rice with chicken white sauce and a few small pieces of chicken. I seem to be able to eat it. I hope things improve for you with the next treatment! Love, hugs, and prayers, Kat",
