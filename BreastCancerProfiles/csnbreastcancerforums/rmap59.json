    "Content": "Joycelouise, I have enjoyed reading your post and the replies. It is interesting that all cancer patients dont utilize this forum but I have told people about it and they never felt the need to use it. I have been on both sides as patient and caregiver. I was dx with colorectal cancer and hang out mostly on that forum however, my Mom was just dx with breast cancer and that's why I have been hanging around with you guys some. You have provided me with much useful info and support Thanks! I too love animals, 4 dogs and 3 cats. I love the great outdoors, I am very practical and a giver. I love Jesus Christ, my family and friends and people in general. I am reserved to an extent and I too believe knowledge is power. When I am faced with a difficult task I will get all the info I can on the subject, then I feel ready to take it on. I am not an artist but love artistic things such as music, paintings, photos. I hope that everyone here gets as much out of this as I have. Robin",
