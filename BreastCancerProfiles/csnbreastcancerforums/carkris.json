I know I have to take this pill to stave off the disease and I dont like it. I will probably be on an extrogen blocker for the rest of my life. My disease was not great. I find exersize helps alot, I am stiffer without it. it sounds counterintuitive but the pain will improve. I try to decrease salt. I am the type who swells easily with it. I just talked to my onc and he said the 'chemo brain\" I experience could be from the tamoxifen. I can be such an airhead and it really frustrates me as I wasnt that way before. More blonde or senior moments than I like. so now I have to compensate for this. I will say the side effects have gotten better or more tolerable. As far as amy depression I take an antidepressant and I think it helps. I had CMF the first time I had cancer, It was more tolerable than the recent chemo I had. I didnt lose my hair although it thinned significantly. No chemo is great. As Chen says 'we do what we have to do so we can do what we want to do\" tough choice we will support you either way.",

My PS was going to replace the drain and I begged him not to, so he had drained 180 or so cc 's then wrapped my chest(bilat) and I kept it on faithfully, took it off to shower and for a one hour break. it never came back. My regular surgeon was amazed as she was expecting on my check up to have to drain me. This will resolve, but I know it is hard waiting. now it seems like a dim memory.(they did tell me some people have the drains for many weeks)",

      "Content": "Ok first take a deep breath. You are experiencing anxiety because everything happened so fast.Now you are not in panic mode you are second guessing yourself. There are many women on this board, some choose lumpectomy and rads, some choose mastectomy. some it is chosen for us. We make the best decision at the time. I am not sure why your docs recomended bilateral mastectomy. perhaps it was your pathology, or you expressed a desire to not have to deal with it again. With BC there are no guarantees. However, my first BC was node negative, 8 mm, estrogen negative. I had a mastectomy because of DCIS.in 1994 at age 34. in the interim had biopsies, negative or precancer. I became very anxious and was seriously looking into propholactic mastectomy. Although the docs did not agree they did say it could be done. no emergency, I was planning it for the fall, but unfortunately in May got diagnosed with BC again. more advanced. It was not detected on mammo. and was even inconclusive on MRI. I really wish I had bilateral mastectomy from the get go. I would have avoided a lot of anxiety and misery. Of course hind sight is 20/20. My chances may have been less but when you fall on the low side of the percentages, its little comfort. Hard to say where you would fall. Nobody knows what causes this or who would recur, I guess I am one of those people who makes BC. I do believe it makes sense that if you have less breast tissue, there is less to get cancer. adding tamoxifen lowers your chances. I know the stats say mastectomy vs lumpectomy are the same. but I think it depends on why you get cancer and nobody knows that. (just my opinion) Perhaps Heather Belle will add something, she is a young woman who made the same choice. Mastectomies are hard, no doubt. Like i said we all make our choices, none of them wrong. I hope I have not offended anyone, I support any ones decision. In fact this has been difficult to talk about as it makes me really sad, but I wanted you to know that there are people who wish they had made your decison. To bring you comfort. God Bless! P.S. I had a second mastectomy without hesitation, turns out I needed it anyway.",

We need to be mindful of what we say and the affect on others that read our posts. WhenI was diagnosed the first time at 34 it was tough, I didnt have an online community or a computer for that matter and this forum has been helpful. But one problem is in this type of forum is we dont know each other, and the details of their lives, and what we say can be far reaching. I know progress has been slow, but we have made some progress, with estrogen blockers, and her 2. people are living longer with stage 4. and diagnosed earlier. More needs to be done. But I feel hopeful with every new advance. Breaking the human genome has been helpful and we are starting to understand why cancer is so hard to eradicate. it is my opinion that cancer will become a chronic illness. One great treatment for leukemia Gleevac has saved so many. anyway... I have to have hope in my life for my family and all my sweet sisters.

Many people have to deal with life altering physical changes. people who have lost limbs in the war etc... accidents, fires, Not judging you, it is something I have to tell myself. It really sucks, and I am sorry. I hate this sneaky disease. One thing that gives me hope is perhaps there are new less radical treatment down the line. Ones that you can use a milder form of chemo and a new drug so you can keep your hair. when I first started there was no herceptin, tamoxifen was just started to be used, aromatase inhibitors etc... So although it seems like for always perhaps not.The PARP inhibitors are showing promise. I think its great your family doesnt agree with you. means they love you and want you around. Means they love you just the way you are. However we are here and we get it. I think some of it is accepting that cancer has come back, but beat that monster down!!!!!! HUGs!!!!!",

I wanted the second mastectomy as I was tired of biopsies. just happened I had a lump prior to being able to schedula a propholactic mastectomy. I think the first ime I was 34 and a deer in the headlights. I had dreams about it after and had thoughts about my femininity. but never one to be into \"looks\" helped. believe it or not I feel more symetrical now. I had one large remaining breast that was impossible to match with a prostheseis.and dressing was hard I had a reconstruction the first time but had to have it removed because of a local recurrance and radiation a year later. This time the radiation oncoloogist wants my expander removed. too complicated to deal with here. ANYWAY, have you consisdered reconstruction? is it because the tissue has been already radiated? I dont find it such a big deal. the surgery went well I was out of the hospital in 24 hours instead of 2 days had minimal pain, I dont have alot feeling but its not unpleanant and no real shooting pains. The tightness can be helped with stretching and moisturizing. I have to admit to feeling a little weird if I go out with womwn and they start talking about their boobs alot or bras. Sometimes reality hits and women dress more open these day and I think about what I have been through, but not too long, would I dress that way prob not I am pretty conservative. Not to minimize but it can be part of the battle. your mammmos will go quicker. anyway you are normal to feel this way, but you will be ok. Hugs to you and hoping your surgery goes well/",

(i see now through your post it really doesnt sound that way) and it is a common problem. I returned very limited to work in Oct and have just felt drained. I hurt all over from being on my feet. I also have neuropathy which makes the effort more. But I think if I wasnt so drained that I could overcome the other things. (hopefully) . Which then leads to depression. I know for me being tired and NO ENERGY really affects my mood. and after going through treatment, and being ill, it gets real old. I talked to the NP and she said, it hasnt been long enough, she said it is a year after treatment is done, and that radiation has delayed effects. I think its a vicious cycle, and another new normal. But I too feel that I work and then recover from working. I am setting a short term goal of the one year mark to re evaluate. You also did not have adequate time to rest, with the weekend care of your parents. What I tell myself in my good days is to be patient and give it time. Then everything will come together. But my computer, my bed, and my couch are really my best friends. LOL plus I dont think this winter has been to good for us, as far a getting out, getting exersize etc.. Hugs I am sorry that you all are going through this, but am glad its not just me!!! also then NP said the tamoxifen didnt help either!",

I have a new primary but that is not the subject at this point. Life will never return to normal but you will have a \"new normal\" I remember thinking i would never be happy again and I was. It's not something that happens overnight it is a gradual thing, where you realize you dont think about it all the time, mostly at appointments or that odd pain. Even then you can put that in perspective. My doctor called it tincture of time. I am a crazy worrier too. So not someone who is easy going at all. You will be happy again but your body has to adjust, and you have to regain your energy. It will be a gradual process but it will happen!",
