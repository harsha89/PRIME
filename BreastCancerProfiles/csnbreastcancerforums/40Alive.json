    "Content": "I have been taking Letrozole since August 2017.  The first few months I really didn't notice much for side effects except for losing my hair (thankfully I had a lot to begin with) and stiff hands.  However since December, the stiffness has spread to other joints but my hands aren't too bad now.  Do you see the side effects come and go and change the longer you are on the medication?  I'm just beginning my journey as I will have surgery and radiation in a few months as the onc and surgeon wanted to do Letrozole first to see how my tumor responded.",
