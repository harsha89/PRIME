    "Content": "I too was faced with this question in January of this year. I had to think about the emotional fact of looking down and nothing there.  I decided to do the partial and had to have my nipple reconstruction because of where the tumor was. I had my surgery on January 23rd of this year, was very blessed with a well behaved cancer so I only had to do radiation therapy 30 of those.  I will have my first mammogram since surgery in august and kinda nervous about that which I'm sure everyone is at that point.  I am taking letrozole for the next 5 years and my hot flashes are terrible. Stay positive , pray and let God help you. Missy love",
