    "Content": "Beautiful ,I too have found that cancer, chemo and treatments in general do change you, I also strayed away from former friends, because I now realize life is so precious and don,t want to be around those that don,t feel the same way. I know something spiritual happens to US who go through such as this cancer thing, so we can,t stay as we were, and when U survive as long as I have then I KNOW it is GOD and that I have something left to do and I know this is what IT IS (HELPING OTHERS ) get through ALSO. GOD BLESS U ALL. msphil",
