    "Content": "Hi everyone....this is just the perfect topic for me...I had my last chemo on July 2010. Had a prophylactic mastectomy on my right breast in Sept 2010 (I had double mastectomy). My cancer was Stage 1 with no lymph nodes involvement. 5 weeks ago I had my final reconstructive surgery. 2 days ago, i notice a small lump in my right breast (the cancer breast was the left breast). The lump is on the lower part of my breast. I can even see the lump buldging a little on the surface of my skin. its rounded, moves a little and no pain...Its like its stuck to my silicon! I am gonna see my surgeon tmrw. Its been only 3 mths since my mastectomy and 6 mths since my chemo. What if the lump is cancerous??!! How can this happen again! I am praying and hoping its just a scar tissue and a fat tissue! Marina",
