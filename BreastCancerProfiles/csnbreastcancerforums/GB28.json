    "Content": "im newly diagnosed this year and post surgery have only been on Tamixifen for about 3weeks. My sisters and I decided a break from all of this was in order, so off to the Florida gulf we went!  After one day on the beach I felt 'itchy' but thought little of it. After day two I had a raised, itchy, bubbly poison ivy type rash all over! I did use sunblock, and I'm generally a 'dark tan' skin type but it looks like my days of relaxing in the sun are limited and change is in order for the next five years :-/  one search in google brought up multiple links to 'tamoxifen and Sun Senditivity' ",
