      "Content": "You are NOT a rotten mother. First of all your children are old enough to understand a little of what you are going through, they are not babies, they are young adults. Secondly, they have two wonderful role models. Between you and your husband they need to follow along with the way you are dealing with this hard time in your life. I have never gone, but it is said that the support groups, which are in just about every city are wonderful. Counseling may help them as they are surly not alone with their feelings. I personally just knew I was going to be fine. Come to find out I was the only one that thought that way. My husband and kids thought I was a goner. They never pitied me but were there when I needed them and did what they could to pick up the slack. I would suggest that you do whatever you can for as long as you can, we all know how tired we can get, and your boys will adapt to your schedule. Remember it's not the quantity of time it's the quality of time that counts. Nancy",

      "Content": "I was going to PT for a \"frozen right shoulder\" when my breast cancer was diagnosed. I agree with what has been said, the pain was so bad that I had to quit my job. They gave me all the usual exercises. As soon as my chemo began the \"frozen shoulder\" disappeared and hasn't returned going on 4 years. The explanation my doctors gave was that even though the cancer was with my left breast the tumor was on my chest wall and was interfering with the motion of my right arm. I had chemo before surgery to dislodge the tumor and chemo after surgery plus all that radiation we get. I am now back in PT as there is so much scar tissue from the radiation my ROM is in no way as good as it should be and my muscles are so tight. I was sent to a pain clinic and was issued a TENS unit which hasn't helped. Just seems kind of funny that we have all had the diagnoses of frozen shoulder. And why if anyone knows, does it seem that 9 out of 10 women develop breast cancer in the left breast. I hardly ever hear of someone having it in the right breast.",
