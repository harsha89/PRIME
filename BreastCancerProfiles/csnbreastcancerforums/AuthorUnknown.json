      "Content": "Hi Wendy, I was diagnosed in May with DCIS. My tumor was 7mm, yet the receptors were positive for estrogen, progesterone and Her 2. I was also told that it was 85% benign calcifications before the needle biopsy results were in.I was told in mammography that they were 99% sure it was benign. I also had the blue dye, I did not pee blue nor did my breast turn blue. I did 33 radiation treatments this summer and I will see my oncologist in two weeks to start aromatase inhibitors and Arimedex. I don't know if I am spelling these right. I am scared. I hate the nature of the tumor. It was aggressive even though it was very small. The did not recommend chemo for that.",

I have a website that you can go to to find out some very interesting stuff about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, indigestion, weight loss, and why it is proven to be the best in the world. It is made from whole foods, and is the most complete, highest grade, and most absorbable vitamins, minerals(amino acid chelated), enzymes, and probiotics known on the planet ALL IN ONE CHEAP BOTTLE!! It has everything you need to nutritionally support your entire body and it's all for $40 bucks. Some of the ingredients cost more than that for a single ingredient, not to mention that most of what you buy in the store can actually cause cancer, heart disease, and more. Just read the label, if it doesn't say words like carrots, wild yams, and other vegetable words that you know, then they are synthetic and they could be hurting you, and even if they're not they not doing you much good either. Please for you and everyone you know, share this website- it's www.dontforgettotakeyourvitamins.com/wiley15427",

You can make your own \"night guard\", something to put over your upper teeth to provide cushioning while you sleep. Just get an athletic mouth guard like the boys use for football at the sporting goods store and follow the directions. That is what I use. Mine is just as good as the one the dentist made and cost only $4.00!",
