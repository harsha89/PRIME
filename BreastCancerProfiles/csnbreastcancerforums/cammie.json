    "Content": "Ballons are falling from the sky!!!!! Yea no more chemo. I have been finished with chemo since April, I need this site more now then when I was in chemo. I found out that once my chemo stopped, I was more depressed. I am currently on my first week with Zoloft. (So the effects on the meds have not started yet) Now that you can breath, you might start researching and finding out more information about your cancer, which can be pretty frightening. You are not alone. You have done the best treatment and the most aggressive path. Best wishes to you! Smile Cammie",
