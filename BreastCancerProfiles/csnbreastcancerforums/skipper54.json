She still has the wound vac but it will hopefully come off on the 28th. She really aprreciated all your support. On another note. I just referred someone else to this board yesterday who had a bi-lateral last week. Met her cousin at the store and passed along the info. Here's hoping she'll look us up!!!!!!

My PS wouldn't consider reconstruction until after rads. I saw him last when I still had 10 days to go (back in March) and he scheduled a visit for the end of August. He'll look at skin integrity at that point and decide what to do. I've heard of women having problems with reconstructed breasts if that is done before rads. Everything is your decision but do some more asking.",
