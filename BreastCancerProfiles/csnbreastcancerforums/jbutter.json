    "Content": "Hi i had double mesectomy with stage 2 breast cancer with lymph node testing positive with immediate reconstruction done and i have fybromyalgia. I dont half to have radiation but i am starting chemo next week. I got through the surgery and it was tuff but with the pain meds it was managable. The reconstruction with the expanders in is very uncomfortable and when they fill them it is painfull of about a day or two but again the pain meds help. I you went through surgery and didnt have the reconstruction at the same time and half to have radiation you really need to talk to the plastics about the healing process with radiation. I sometime wish i hadnt had the reconstruction done now its is added pain i think you would only know how much you can take, having fibro for 10 years now hasnt been easy i know what you go through on a daily basis this was my worst worry with surgery is how long it was going to take to get back and now with the chemo and then another surgery ahead for the implants is alot to think about right now. Just take a day at a time you only know your body, maybe after all the radiation is done and you are healed you will feel you can tackle another surgery. I wish you luck and hope you will find your answer for you. HUGS, Jan",
