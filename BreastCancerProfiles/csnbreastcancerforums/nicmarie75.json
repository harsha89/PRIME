    "Content": "I have never personally had cancer, I participate in Relay for Life every year, I have several family members that have had Cancer, my grandma surpassed her 5 yr mark after a lung cancer DX in 2004, my other grandmother had BC back in the the late 70's she is now 80. Her BC was caught VERY early and she had a Mastectomy on the one side and that was it. No Chemo or radiation etc. My grandfather passed away from a head/neck cancer. My mom died at 42yrs old from Kidney cancer.....I FEAR cancer. I read all these stories of BC in women in their 30's but mammogram isn't done until 40. I had my annual visit at 34yrs old in 09' she did my breast exam and prior to starting she said to start Mammograms at 40, then halfway through she said I should start at 35 and by the end of my exam she said well, why don't you go soon and I did. My report was clean from my mammogram....Should I be doing yearly mammograms? I try to do self exams and I can't seem to tell what I am doing, it feels lumpy all over if you ask my unprofessional opinion. Then I read about IBC and that scares the crap out of me, there are no lumps with IBC right? I hate living in fear that I am going to get Cancer someday, I posted something similiar in the Kidney cancer forum but thought I would post here since my grandma (fathers side) had BC...so far she was the only one in my immediate family. Though my grandpa (moms side, the one who had head/neck cancer) had several sisters and one that I know of had many children and lots of her family died from Cancer in general. Sorry if I am rambling....",
