      "Content": "I took eight weeks of Taxol and found them to be fairly easy. I did continue to feel tired, but the other side affect was pain in my joints. The pain usually started in my neck about 2 days after by Taxol and the shot and then the pain went into my shoulders. I really never had any pain in my lower body. I could control it with Aleve. I do have some tingling in my fingers which is normal. It did take longer to receive the Taxol-about 3 hours because it must be administered slowly. You can do it. Blessings, Cindy",

      "Content": "Take someone with you to your initial appointment-your mind will be spinning. Take someone to each chemo treatment. I always get benadryl which makes me sleepy so I can't drive home. I think it is Very important to practice good dental care. I have always flossed and I also brush 3 times a day. I had no mouth problems. Eat what you want when you want and if it tastes good-keep it on hand. Take a nap daily if you can. My counts have been extremely high and I believe my naps have made all the difference. Best of luck. Cindy",

      "Content": "My doctor approved ginger tablets. I used the 250 mg. tablets and starting taking them 2-3 days before my treatments. I took 2 the first day and 3 the day before my treatment. I only threw up one time. I also had a prescrption from the doctor which helped in the 2-3 times I needed it. For my taxol the doctor told me to go to the vitamin shop and get glutamine powder. I took 2 teaspoons 3 times a day 2 days for before treatment and continued this for the day of treatment and 4 days after. It seems to have really helped with joint pain and tingling of the extremeties. The Taxol has been much easier in general. Hope you do well.",
