    "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with lobular breast cancer that has spread to my bones. I currently am on Arimidex with no plans for either surgery or radiation. My oncologist says this is the best treatment for now. I live in Baltimore and am trying to get a second opinion from Johns Hopkins hospital soon. I am 55 years old, scared to death, and the list of unknowns is endless. I am also despressed and can't seem to shake the feelings of dread. Is there anyone else out there that has been diagnosed with this type of breast cancer (lobular breast cancer that did not even show up on a 12/27/06 mammogram). My only symptom was back pain. I'd love to hear from someone who can give me insight on how to get from day to day and live my life again. My husband has been great - it's me that can't seem to find the energy to even get out of the house.",
