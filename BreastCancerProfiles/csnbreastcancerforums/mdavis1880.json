    "Content": "Hi all. I was diagnosed Dec 1, 2000 and have just finished my 3rd A/C treatment. I had lumpectomy, stage 1 to 2 tumor with no lymph node involvement. My biggest concern at the moment is my hair. I know that sounds shallow but I can't help it. It has not yet all fallen out. Did anyone else have this experience. Also I wonder if life will ever seem normal again. It seems all I want to hear about are long term survivors. I just need to know it is possible. Also I have changed my diet. No meat, no dairy, no sugar. I go to accupunture, am seeing an herbalist, and do yoga and meditation. Are there others out there that have went to these extremes. Thanks for any responses.",
