    "Content": "Hi Gloria, I'm Sara and I just started my rad treatments on Feb 11, 2010. When I got up on Feb 12, 2010 I was nausea. I'm not sick from a cold or anything like that. Had my second treatment in the afternoon on Feb 12, 2010 and that night I felt sick again. I asked the ladies who administer the rads and they say that nausea is not a symptom, but for me I believe it is. I will know after I take my treatments next week. Good luck.",
