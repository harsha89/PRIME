    "Content": "Kathy, I am currently on the same treatment regimen as you. I just had treatment number 2 two days ago and so far feel pretty \"OK\". Maybe a little more tired. I did find it helpful to journal my day to day symptoms after my first treatment. It will help me know what to plan for each time thereafter. I am a bit of a control freak and seem to do better if I know what it coming. Every one responds so differently to their treatment. I feel blessed that I have had only minor side effects. Mostly fatigue, manageable. Some body aches, also manageable. The actual infusions are uneventful for me. My oncologist gives me a pretreatment infusion with steroids, zofran and benadryl. I pretty much sleep thru the chemo and then go home and nap. My husband is there for support. Anxiety is normal. I think you will feel better knowing what to expect after your first treatment is done. Until then, deep breath and know we are all here to support you! Michelle",
