    "Content": "I'm currently on a weekly schedule of Taxol. . .I have FAC after the taxol treatment is done. I haven't had any nausea. But, I think the weekly schedule just kind of wears a person down - or at least it has for me. I have intermittent neuropathy - but nothing too terribly bad. I don't get any type of shot after the taxol - but the hospital does admin some type of steroid for the first 15 minutes of my drip - then the taxol for 1 hour.",
