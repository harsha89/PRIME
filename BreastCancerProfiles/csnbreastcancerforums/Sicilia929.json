    "Content": "I did NOT want chemo. I agreed to it because my sister had had breast cancer 16 years ago and she had chemo. I agreed because the people I love the most wanted me to do it. I should have listened to my own head and heart, BUT...as it turned out, my body helped make the decision. I had one infusion Oct. 2nd, 2009. Lost all my hair 17 days later. Went to my second infusion Oct. 23rd - the one the nurse had referred to as the \"easy\" one (her rationale...you had one, know what to expect, but you haven't acquired all the cumulative effects yet). Well, after the zofran and the steroid drips went in, the taxotere hit my body and I went into anaphylactic (sp) shock. This was a Friday. I saw the doctor on Monday. He asked me to give him a week to figure out something. I agreed, but my decision was pretty much made prior to seeing him. I saw him the next Tuesday and he proposed 'desensitizing' my body. I said no way. My body spoke and I listened. I finish radiation on the 11th. Then I have to make the tamoxifen decision. Only you can and should make this decision. I made the right one for me, of this I am certain. I didn't stop because I couldn't take it. You do what you have to do, but I turned it down because I believe it would do me far more harm than any good. Good luck and God bless.",
