    "Content": "Hi, deep breath and do some yoga breating to relax. I had bad mamo JUne 2008, the machine for the biopsy...broke and my biopsy got delayed, twice to you believe? I ended up with 3 lumpies, (I have DCIS) and did not start rads till almost Oct. Made me wackie for sure. But was my outcome changed due to delay? no. Did my BP go up? yeaper Now over all the rads, doing femara and this month it will be 2 years from the start. Start your own list of relaxation things. It will help. Since I have a mamo upcoming I also have a massage, facial planned for the weekend before the mamo. DCIS has a hi level of successful treatment so thing only strong thoughts. Next recommendation...stay busy during all the testing. Go take a hike! Really, you will make it girl~~",
