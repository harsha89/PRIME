      "Content": "I just finished my bilateral masctomy three weeks ago and im getting ready to start 4 rounds of Taxol. My mom had a lumpectomy eight years ago and we are both BRCA1 positive, from what I understand they will just keep a closer eye on me and my daughter who is 15mths will be tested when she is 18yrs old. It increase you risk of developing bc and overian cancer but it doesn't mean you will. And you already have bc so you have beating the gene. I agree with what everyone else says at least we know and can prevernt reoccurance. Heather",

      "Content": "I went to see my ob-onco, I was nervious but after revewing my histor and curret CA125 numbers the only option she could offer was a complete Hestorectomy, with removeral of overies and falopion tubes. Iam very nervous not sure what to expect after surgery, I cant take hormones, I just finished AC-T with a bilateral mastorectomy, I had a stage 3 tumomer in my right brest with stage 1 in my left breast, 3wks ago I had my expanders taken out and sicilocon implants put in and still havent had tatoo or nipple flaps done. Also Im 34 with a 22mth old going through a divorce, husband couldnt take cancer diagnoses or treatment. Any advice on what to expect, menopause and such, my nieboor had one and she is suffering from painfull side effects and hormone problems and hers was done 4mths ago, she did have endromethioes,sp* removed and nerve damage. Thanks, Heather",
