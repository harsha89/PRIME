It has helped me a lot reading all the blogs I am not as scared about the treatment like I was this morning. I called today and I am getting fitted for a wig. I have long hair I guess I will donate my hair for someone like me to have a wig I will pay it forward it will help me I think Get the hair cut before I loose it and it won't be so bad knowing I can help someone else. You all really do help it is a very scary thing the unknown ....thank you",
