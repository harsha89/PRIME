      "Content": "DW- I totally get how you feel and think you should go have a great time choosing a wig. My Onc said she had one patient who got multiple wigs in every color under the rainbow--some not even found in nature! She looked forward to her patient's appointments to see which version would be showing up. I got a short, pretty natural looking wig and then splurged on a long and vixen-ish one. Needless to say, the vixen has spent most of her time on a shelf in the closet--it just didn't go with the decidedly unvixen-ish rest of me! I probably ought to give that to my cancer center to share with a younger survivor. Looking forward to seeing you on the 30th. I'll be looking for the woman with the fabulous hair! Chickadee",

      "Content": "I had bilateral mastectomy 4/29/10. My doctor removed my three drains within the first three weeks (two the first time, the last one later). Afterwards I had fluid buildup on the non-cancerous breast side-no lymph nodes removed from that side. Over the next several weeks I had to go to the surgeon weekly to have fluid needle-aspirated from that side; up to 60ccs at a time. When I went into surgery to have my port implanted for chemo the surgeon inserted another drain. We're now 2 weeks past and I still have around 20 ccs of fluid to drain a day. Has anyone else had this?? If so, how long before it resolves? It doesn't seem to fit the category of lymphedema I read about in another post and my doc hasn't mentioned that. No swelling anywhere else.",

I am blessed to be able to stay home from work; don't know that I could function at a level required by my job. Next week you will feel great!",

I take it about 30 mins before bedtime and it really helps. My onc knows and recommends it as well. If I have any issues now, I take 1/2 a low dose Xanax along with the Melatonin; that lets my mind slow down (I find the million thoughts per minute to be the thing that keeps me awake when I have trouble falling asleep)",
