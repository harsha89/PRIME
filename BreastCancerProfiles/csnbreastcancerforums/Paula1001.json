      "Content": "I expected the fatigue with everything else over the past 9 months, but didn't really expect it for the radiation. I had number 21 today, leaving 4 more. I can barely stay awake or walk the dog some days - like today. However, sitting around doing computer stuff for hours makes my legs tense up, and I keep getting keyboard impressions on my forehead, lol. Is there a particular type of food that would help? Should I force myself to walk more? Any ideas would be appreciated. And any words of wisdom re Arimidex? I just started that 3 weeks ago? The Herceptin hasn't seemed to cause any difficulties.

      "Content": "Ask about side effects and the best way to handle them. Bring someone with you so they can take notes. Listen to your doc and ask the nurses about side effects also. They can give you information from the patient's side of things. Drink lots of water and eat multiple small meals per day versus three regular meals. Have Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash on hand. Good luck. Paula",

      "Content": "I started out Stage 3A, 5 tumors, 3 in lymph nodes, all large, HER2+, E+ & P+. After 4 rounds of A/C, double mastectomy with lymph node involvement, and 12 rounds weekly of Taxol/ Herceptin, I'm officially done with the chemo! Yay! I'll continue Herceptin every 3 weeks for 9 months, begin Arimidex soon for 5 years, and I start radiation in one month's time for 6 weeks. We're going camping with the boat and the dogs next weekend to celebrate. For those of you who are early on in this process, remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel and the view is your future. Each stage is frightening in its own way, but this too shall pass. Every stage gets you closer to completion. Good Luck all. So, it takes about a month for the Taxol to completely purge from your body? Can I then blow my nose without the nose bleeds? Can't wait to be close to normal again. :-) Is there anything I need to know about radiation to help it be as easy as possible to endure? Has anyone had side effects from the Herceptin alone? Thanks for your input. Paula",
