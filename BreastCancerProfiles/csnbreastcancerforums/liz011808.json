      "Content": "Hello Everybody, This afternoon while watching the news, they show Hannah the 10 year old girl with cancer. It is true and it is very sad that a very young girl will have to experience the pain (physical and emotional)of going through the surgery and treatment. I am really sad and also angry that cancer is so vicious that whoever get it is getting younger and younger. I hope she gets better. God bless, Liz",
