    "Content": "I had the brachytherapy radiation after lumpectomy 3 years ago and YES I have the same diagnosis.  The pain is excruciating and so far I have found no relief from any pain medication.  I have tried accupuncture, massage, I am getting a tiens (or tens) unit and looking into cold laser therapy.  I would love to hear from you as I am told it is rare too but I have a feeling doctors are not reporting this.   This has changed my life and I'm sure yours too.  Would love to hear from you.  nancepowers@yahoo.com",
