      "Content": "How did you react when you got the news of the reoccurrence? Was it as hard as the first diagnosis? What treatments did you have 10 years ago? Some things have changed in 10 years. I did 4 AC treatments and 4 Taxotere. The Taxotere was different but no worse than the AC. I took steroids before during and after to counter the side-effect of pain in the joints. It helps some. My head was sore like a bruse a couple days after each treatment. My hair actually started to grow back during the Taxotere treatments. I gave control of my treatments over to my doctor. I went through the motions ... then when treatment was done I was really scared ... and I was not at all in control of my body. I gained weight I looked awful ... got depressed. I'm better now. Hang in there! Let us know how you make out. Jamie",

      "Content": "LaVerne I am 10 months out from my last radiation. I was really tired with chemo and worked through the chemo and radiation ... for some reaseon the radiation was less tiring for me ... the whole thing is a huge energy drain to begin with ... so it's not one item it's the whole mess!! I was very depressed so I went to a therapist who hooked me up with a Phyciatrist and I take 75 mg. Zoloft made a huge difference in my mood. I also had my thyroid checked ... I'm telling everyone this ... and it was low ...after about 6 weeks the aches and pains I thought were from the Taxotere chemo and the Tamoxifen were gone. I am out of shape but basically back to my old self. I gained a lot of weight and that wares me out but energy and aches are under control. I think checking with a mental health care professional if you GP won't prescribe is the best idea. My Oncologist even prescribes anti depressants and anti anxiety medications. The same drugs don't work the same for everyone ... so the Psychiatrist was the best bet for me. As for your boss you need to tell him/her just what you said in your message \"you have a lot to offer your department ... your staff understands ... and no one else would do as good a job as you\" plus if you performed in the past ... it's obvious you're just going through the healing phase ... right? You hang in and be tough!! Lots of luck to you!! Jamie",

However now I have read that it can decrease the effectiveness of Tamoxifen. I'm afraid if I tell my Oncologist he'll tell me to stop taking it. Has anyone has experience with Tamoxifen and St. John's Wort? What are the Oncologist's saying?",

      "Content": "Hi Melanie - I live in Frederick MD and know Hopkins very well ... my daughter works for Hopkins. They do have a great reputation. I do not have lobular BC but I do have mets to the bones. I was DX stage 2 in 2000. Thought it was gone ... 2005 found spots on my spine and hip. I was taking Tamoxifen and then my Onc switched me to Atimidex. Since I am HER2/Nue positive (meaning an agressive gene) it didn't take to that. I switched to a couple other things and then put on Herceptin. Herceptin alone slowed everything down but still didn't stop it so I started Xeloda (an oral chemotherapy for advanced BC) and my bone scans are clear. I should mention I also had radiation on the spine and hip. I actually didn't think I had back pain but when I completed my radiation my back felt really good so ... I guess the cancer was effecting my back. Maybe radiation will ease your pain. AND I have been on Zometa since the very beginning. Zometa is a bone strenghtener. Patients with Osteoperosis take Zometa. I think the key is to get all the pathology factors .. like is it estrogen positive, her2/nue positive. Then they can find the best treatment. I am very sorry that you have to go through with this ... I'm glad to hear you have a good supportive husband. Mine is too. I have had to stay on anti drepessants in order to maintain a normal life ... and I believe they really work. After all ... who wouldn't be depressed! So if it is any consolation ... I've been at this for 6 years ...I'm 49 and expect this is my new way of life ... I am treating it as a chronic illness ... because I am not disabled, never missed more than 2 weeks of work (for original surgery) and expect to be around to retire ...just like everyone else. So ... get as much care as you can ... JH is great ...my Onc uses the same protocals. If you want to email me directly ...please do ... my home email address is jamie112357@adelphia.net.",

It takes at least three weeks to get over the hump ... then it may be months to start running again. It can get depressing but it does get better. Are you going to take radiation? That could make you a little tired but nothing compared to the chemo ... at least I didn't think so and I worked through the chemo and the radiation. Good luck to you. Let us know how you do ... and when you feel better ...TELL US ...it's good to hear good news!!!",

      "Content": "The Dr office left me a message that I had a fibroid on my uterus and a cyst on my right ovary and there wasn't anything we could do about that. Well... the fibroid I was aware of but ovarian cysts are not common after menapause so I don't like that answer at all. I put in a call to the Dr saying just that ... and reminding her of my high risk for ovarian cancer. This is just my GP not the Oncologist. Should I pursue more tests of the cycst or should I except that it's okay. Has anyone had a cyst after \"chemical (chemo) menapause\"? Thanks for listening. Jamie",

AND...days before my final chemo (4 AC, 4 Taxotere) I had a bleeding problem that my Oncologist got so concern about that he had me have a colonoscopy immediately!! It turned out to be diverticulum and hemmorroids ... not serious. I had a lot of digestive track irritation from the chemotherapy. Anyway ... he would have ordered the colonoscopy as a follow-up test for me and I got it over with early. I'm assuming you've never had one. The test is the easy part ... you get put into \"twilight\" sleep... the prep is what got me ... the stuff you have to drink!!! Anyway ... get the test .. and be worry free. Peace to you, Jamie",
