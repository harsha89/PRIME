      "Content": "1.A little more on what to do to prevent kidney cancer.As I mentioned above broccoli.And it says only 1/2 cup serving 2 times a week.Not much.Cuts your chance of kidney cancer by 44%.WOW!!!! I forgot that on my above post. 2.People who drink 12 or more cups of fluids daily are 50% less likely to develop kidney cancer than folks who drink 5 or fewer glasses of fluid a day. I suspected this.I am GUILTY.I don't drink enough. 3.THE BLADDER.Bladder cancer is often overlooked because doctors think you have a bladder infection but it very well could be cancer.I agree.I was tested for cancer after a few other things didn't work.First I didn't have a infection, then I did and then didn't.So it was over a month before the urologist tested me for bladder cancer.It was negative. Then I was tested for kidney cancer with the slight trace of blood.Kidney stones.So it can be passed off by doctors.I was a mess with worry.Only been dx 16 months with BC.Then took awhile for tests,doc appt meds etc till I found out stones and cyst of the kidneys that caused my slight bleeding. Another guilty thing for me. I hold my urine.You MUST go to the bathroom more often to flush toxic compounds in urine out of the body.So urinate often to flush the bladder.Good point and it makes sense. So I have been guilty of all.Never knew about the broccoli but was very aware of drinking but thought 64 ounces a day would be fine.8 glasses but we need 12 glasses or more.I don't drink alot. Good post again from Love Baby Jesus.I just wanted to share some things I just HAPPENED upon yesterday when my husband had tests. I have some heart things too but will start another post.Hope I can read my writing. A note.I've never heard of heart cancer till several years ago. I know of a lady who had heart cancer.A tumor on the back of her heart.She was in her late 60's early 70's. She lived one month after dx. Her daughter-in law is my cousin.First heart cancer I heard of. Shocking. Lynn Smith",

      "Content": "I hope your test turns out fine.Maybe you won't have to worry and make decisions on what to do.Sounds like that doctor isn't compassionate.I am sure only seeing 2 patients like you mentioned he may not be busy. I've had delays on (biopsies) that have upset me terribly.Also had doctors know I have a problem.I asked one not to push where I hurt.He did anyway so he's GONE.This could have caused a bowel obstruction but he pushed anyway.I know some of his patients and they are feeling the same way.Also had a doctor who knew I had bc but all he wanted to do was X rays that are dangerously high in radiation.I found a doctor who does less invasive test and minimal radiation.Fired that one too.So 2 down for me and it was a matter of a few months.One doctor I had for 5 months and the other for 25 years.See what BC does to you.Makes you wake up and not put up with BULL. Wishing you the best when with your results the coming week. Waiting is very hard.A Couple week ago I had to wait 2 days and I was very worried.The tumor was found 3 weeks earlier so I was in a panic. Get it out or do a needle biopsy. Did a needle biopsy.It was benign.I wish that for you. Lynn Smith Lynn Smith",

I also have to agree it is in the cards also. I look at my friend.She did everything right.She is living after 16 years.My mom well she did fair with her lifestyle(foods stress etc) and she lived 60 years.My niece(double mascetomy)is still living after 6 years.Her and her husband smoke constantly but they respect others who don't.With my niece only being 36 I hope she will realize she needs to quit smoking.It could be lung cancer next. The bladder thing seems right and what we should do.Keep the bladder flushed and drink alot.That makes sense to me. I wish I was a better eater and ate alot of meat and protein but I don't.My blood works comes out good everytime.At least I never hear anything about it being bad. If you are dx with a invasive cancer I don't think things would be easy.You don't know what to do. You feel it is lurking and just waiting to come out.Even me with non invasive cancer I think about it. As we all Hear.Early detection saves lives. Lynn Smith",

I never smoked but there are things I would have a very hard time stopping. Drinking caffeine free coke or pepsi. I wish you the best.If like anything else going cold turkey be careful.I went off Caffeine(coke) cold turkey and I had palipations.I never thought that would happen.I just quit drinking caffeine coke and my heart was racing. I had to call my heart doctor.He thought I might be having some other episode and ran tests. But 6 months later I realized it was going off caffeine cold turkey.I am sure cigarettes could be the same way.You possibly could have withdrawal symptons. It is best but just take it slow.You will feel better.My husband is short of breath alot and I know if he quit it would make a big difference. Keep us posted on how you're doing. Lynn Smith",

I have osteoporosis.I have no problems.Also had a total hysteroctomy which helps me in not getting uterine cancer or other problems that occur with the uterus.My friends took Tamox and are doing great after 16 years and 6 years.One friend took another drug after tamox and she wishes there was soemthing else.AND she is like me hates taking meds.She wants the security of taking something that keeps the beast from returning. Seems my doctor mentioned something else after tamox.Can't remember.If so I will take it.My cancer was non invasive(Stage 0) but still so many other cancers I can get and even another type of breast cancer. For Hair loss there is some but my hair was already thin.I do shave my legs but not often.What I am hoping after I am off the tamox my hair gets thicker.That is my dream. Lynn Smith",

I'm depressed.I want to be bigger more than ever now.It's teh cancer thing. I guess I would also feel kinda put off when someone lets it all out and working with breast cancer patients.I don't think I ran into that yet.I would think she was rubbing it in.Esp like those who've had masectomies.Those of us who've had lumpectomies feel it too. I think the one place I've noticed the workers letting it all out is the supermarkets.I am shocked the mamagers let these ladies and younger women show so much.The stores were I live let it happen.Where my husband works it got so bad with low cut tops all of the men and women MUST wear tee shirts and all dress the same tops.It was because women were letting it all hang out.

I was at my last paragraph.Here comes my husband.I put paper and pen in my purse.Leave and realize I forgot my keys.So back to the X ray area. Now I am catching up around the house but want to share with my Pink Sister a few things I learned.I just need a bit more time.One thing I found was our kidneys need broccoli.2 times a week.That and brussel sprouts are my favorite veggies.The kidneys did get my attention though. It was saying we MUST take care of them. After my dx I had tests done that showed kidney stones and a kidney cyst. Oh and it said that the broccoli helps prevent kidney cancer. I sure learned something new and sharing it with all of you now. I will share other things later but got to work around here for a few hours.That kidney info I wanted to share with you now.Because I worry about my organs and esp my kidneys since they are already affected in some way. Thank You a bunch for the reminder.I also worry about all my organs.It is a major thing for me but honestly am not the best eater.I was eating broccoli a couple times a week but slacked.Gotta go back to it.The reason I was eating it was because of the antioxidents.Now I see it is better than I thought for me.Kidney cancer preventer.

My breast surgeon and the surgeon who did my hysterectomy had a serious discussion about me taking hormones.Years having benign tumors and mom being a bc survivor my breast surgeon told me NEVER take them.My gyno doctor said YES.So they had a talk about it and my gyno  never told me to take them again. I knew after talking to my breast surgeon he meant business.It's the welfare of his patient.If I followed my gyno I probably would've had breast cancer much earlier than 62.   Honestly I think gyno's tell you to come but my other doctors know I don't have anything left and don't seem to think it's necessary.They usually ask Did they take the cervix???. Another lady told me she had a hysterectomy over 25 years ago and never had a check up since.She said she didn't need one.She's in her 70's and  I think in her early 50's or late 40's she had her surgery.  Denise I'm sure your doctor will tell you to come in every year.

When I hear these things it makes me more alert of my surroundings.I've been in some sticky situations but managed to be OK because I was alert. Lynn Smith",

This weekend my husband has another day off.Tomorrow(Sunday) and we were going to a concert tonight.That's fizzled.I'm now sick with a cold/nausea.Started less than 2 days after my grandson was here.Never believe it takes time to spread.It happens sooner than what doctors say.All week I've been dragging.TODAY I will be at Urgent Care. Vicks usually knocks this out but not this bug.No fever but worn out and gaggy/coughing all the time. I don't even want to sit in the waiting room to get seen. I Never get colds.It's been over 5 years.I avoid sick people.My X daughter-in-law knew he was sick but sent him anway.As soon as he walked in the door he went to the bathroom and puked. Going to make myself chug to Urgent Care.Don't even want to drive but have to. Lynn Smith",

Like you I've had a few other things going on.Some testing and some scares but things are fine.That is if kidney stones and a kidney cyst pass as being good.At least those things are better than tumors.Just that after my first year seems all these other things started.I will deal with it. I hope you don't have lupus.My sister in law has had it for many many years.She of course takes meds and has spells at times.None lately.Seems the older she gets and the longer she has it things are better. I am like you.Ice Cream in my diet.I am wanting to gain a few lbs I lost.I get the ice cream that has lots of calories. Of course I wonder about my kidney stones but I have a wonderful uroglogist who agrees I need the ice cream for my bones.YEAH.Hey he is the kidney specialist. I haven't been on the Board long but the time I have I've learned so much.Doctors can't tell us everything. Don't stay away so long. Check back with us and let us know how you are doing. Lynn Smith",

From that day on I never missed appts. Then in 2009 a tumor and cyst were found.The Radiology doctor and nurse came out and told me I had a tumor and a cyst(the radiology doctor wasn't worried about the cyst). Almost 6 weeks later the biopsy was done( my new doctor delayed it). Cancer for the tumor.The tumor plus a benign tumor(found when I was getting prepped) were removed.The cyst was never mentioned BUT every mammo now I get a letter saying there is a place that APPEARS to be benign.So I have to trust in this and say it is a cyst and cysts are benign UNLESS they get bigger in size.Then they should be tested. With the 2 cancer surgeries(the 2nd surgery checked margins) the cyst was left. Not mentioned till I get my letter from the Breast Center with my mammo report. Lynn Smith",

It is hard to build bone loss back.Once it is gone it is gone,I believe.

      "Content": "First and foremost find other doctors.We are our own advocates.It happened to me and I about lost it after months of tests.Senseless the way patients are being treated(or should I say not treated) now. I got FED up and went on my way a few times.You should too. I've been going through tests for 3 months now.Last year(FEB 2010) I had a CT scan.It was a bowel problem.I go to my gastro doc.He tells me I have a bowel problem BUT failed to say I had kidney stones and a cyst.A few months go by.Then July 2010 a trace of blood in my urine.My family doc found it but didnt say anythinbg till my Oct appt.Then she said another urinalysis needs to be done.She does it and still a trace of blood in urine.Told me to see a urologist. See him. A trace of blood but now I have a infection.I felt a bit more comfortable. Take that med(antibiotic) go back and trace of blood but NO infection.He decided to get my CT scan taken the year before and check me for bladder cancer too.As i was having the cystocopy done I asked him about the CT scan.You have kidney stones.WHAT I had no idea and a year later???? My bladder was fine but he wanted to do another CT scan.NOT ME I don't want anymore radiation than need.I have bc. He said yes because you have a cyst.EXCUSE me you didn't tell me that.He said yes it is in the report(CT SCAN). I was ticked again.Why didn't he say you have kidney stones and a cyst.AND tell me how many stones too. Needless to say I got rid of the gastro way back at the beginning of 2010 but not because he didn't tell me about my stones.It was time to go.Had him many years but he was getting more and more belligent and not caring.I had no idea when I saw him it was the thing to do..Then I got rid of my new urologist with the CT scan and not telling me about a cyst and how many stones.His reply you have stones. Not how many stones or mentioning the cyst.I was beyond ticked by then. Then I get my 2nd urologist.A KUB was ordered.Still radiation but eventually I broke down because it is minimal.Then he looks up my CT scan that was taken over a year ago.He said I had 8 stones.Now how easy was that.All the other 2 doctors needed to say and maybe I wouldn't need all the test and hassle and firing. He toldme about the cyst but not to worry about that. Just 3 weeks ago all this ended but started in Oct. What trauma you are going through.Unreal. Get rid of those doctors that are letting things go by.It is your life and IMO they aren't caring.Doctors don't ignore things.Funny just the last 2 years I've realized this happens after many years of medical problems.AND you see it too.No reason at all but neglect.Maybe they have to many other things that seem to be more important than their patients.Things are happening like this more than we know. Find some good caring doctors and I wish you the best of care in the future.Get things going. Lynn Smith",

You know the sad part about this is we've both been done wrong(many others too).With cancer dx we are told over and over that stress can be BAD for us.Then the doctors who are treating us for cancer and other conditions are causing us the stress. I'm not taking things off doctors or anyone else anymore. I am going to do things the way I want to do them. I was very very worried after all that time.A year and I would have even if it was a couple weeks. Time means everything to us who are fighting this disease or any other disease. This has upset me knowing what I went through too and now hearing your problems .I have a hard time understanding how these things happen. You are in my thoughts.Will be thinking about you.If you do change doctors get in ASAP.I was fortunate and did.Helped not waiting weeks and only a few days. Lynn Smith",

But I know of a young girl (21) whose hair came back darker(black). Everyone seems to be different I am 64 and still have light brown hair with a touch of gray here and there. It all blends in.BUT sometimes I wish it would all get gray. Not salt and pepper. I have trouble breathing the hair dyes so I will never be able to color my hair. I bet you feel so much better about yourself.After all you went through you are getting back to normal. Lynn Smith",
