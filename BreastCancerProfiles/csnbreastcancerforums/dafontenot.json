    "Content": "Hi, I am the daughter of a brest cancer survivor. My mom had a mastectomy two years ago and has had problems getting her prosthesis to work properly, or should I say \"wear\". It weighs practically nothing compared to the brest she has remaining (44DD) and as a result, her bra rides up which makes it difficult and uncomfortable. Is there a special bra or better prosthesis out there? She doesn't wear the prosthesis anymore and is self conscious when she goes out in public. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Deb.",
