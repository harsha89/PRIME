      "Content": "Mike, If you are worried about being negative and not supportive, you must be a giver in life. The other side of that, though, is letting other people give to you. If you had positive thoughts about bc, you would not have sought out this group. You of all people have reason to feel negative. Allow yourself your be held up instead of being the beam. I have not noticed you being negative, actually, nor have I found your posts discouraging. You suffer from bc and at this time need to be supported. Others are at a time and place where they can be supportive and encouraging now. But even then, there are times when everyone needs a shoulder to lean on. When people encourage you and try to get you to think happy thoughts, they are not making a comment on your attitude or anything. They just hurt for you being in the place you are and want to make it better even though words can't do that. I hope you continue to express yourself in that honest way.",

I know of a few men--some related to me-- that have had bc. Quite a different set of emotions along with the normal ones. I will be hoping for you, and for whomever it is you are caring for. Double whammy, man! I feel for you! Life sure can stink sometimes. (Can't appreciate it, though, until it comes time to smell the flowers.)",

      "Content": "The arguments your husband has given you here as to why you should lose your assets is bogus. He is just trying to bully you and shake your confidence. Any good divorce lawyer is going to be able to help you. Ask any friends who have had divorces who they recommend: or if they got the short end of the stick, ask their exes who they had. Either a good divorce or family law attorney. And it is not true that the more you pay an attorney, the better his services will be. Call around and see what the going rate it. Those who charge way above or way below the average are bad news. But get a good lawyer ASAP and let him deal with your ex and his attorney. Do not let them rattle you. They figure you are in a weakened state and they can bully you.",

      "Content": "Hi, Lady Di! In your post double negative and femara, you mentioned that you were getting chemo. I have the same hormone \"configuration,\" but my doctors told me no chemo this time. (Did the first time, but that was ten years ago before the AIs were the primary line.) Did have surgery, AGAIN, on femara, and will do rads. What kind of chemo did you get and for how long? Did you lose your hair? I am wondering if I should ask my onc about this. Thanks for your input. BTW for those of you who live in fear of recurrence: I am living through a recurrence and my prognosis is good. I am amazed at the amount of progress science has made since my first occurrence ten years ago. I am not afraid of \"it\" coming back again. If it does, I'll just beat it again and there will be more weapons to use. Just like this time! The possibility is always on the back burner of your mind, but it doesn't need to consume you. I like to think of myself not as a survivor, but a VICTOR even though the beast is trying to come alive again. I am just beating it down again, this time harder than before.",

      "Content": "Rae, That scary feeling is so bad, isn't it? Unfortunately, I am afraid that scariness is going to rear its ugly head a lot. That is the \"scar\" bc leaves on your psyche. Chances are the ultrasound is to rule OUT recurrence. But that doesn't do anything to alleviate your fear, does it. I think writing about it to people who understand does help you deal, though. So please continue to express your thoughts. Those of us who are not so gifted in the expression of ideas department gain strength from those of you who do. Have you made an appointment for your ultrasound yet? Please keep us posted. I want to celebrate when you tell us everything was okay! (Don't let that scary feeling drown out your hope!)",

      "Content": "Thanks for the suggestions dmc! I teach, too, and the energy bars and protein water are a great idea! (Original cancer ten years ago and I never did return to my pre energy level--age or cancer treatments? Hard to tell.) I worked through chemo last time--a mistake--and this time, though I am having surgery, rads, but AIS instead of chemo--I am taking all the time off I can! Fortunately, my state gives the teachers disability pay. But when I do go back, I will pack those bars and water! Thanks again! Another question, dmc: after the summer break, do find it takes a while to \"retrain your bladder\" to adjust to the can't-use-the-bathroom part of teaching? I usually can do it in a week, but I worry about how long it will take after a looooooooong break.",

I was told I could not return to work if I had any restrictions at all, like \"use a cane\" or refrain from lifting x pounds. (I work for the state, so I guess they don't want to worry about workmen's comp should I get injured on the job when I had restrictions.) I have the disability from the state, but wonder if anyone ever had any restrictions and if so, what kind. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Barb, I would be concerned that the mammogram would not give the information needed. Did you have an implant put in when you had reconstruction? I can only offer you my experience. I never had the reconstructed side imaged with mammography because it really isn't that effective when you have an implant. Last summer, though, I noticed the scar appeared different and that tiny modules appeared along side of it, and DID appear to be stitches. Then a rash appeared. I do not have much feeling in that side, so I didn't feel any pain until the rash went around to my back where I do still have sensation. The GP thought it was just scar tissue and suggested I see my plastic surgeon. Being ten years out, I had been released from the oncologist and the GP did the follow up as far as blood tests, scans, etc once a year. She wasn't too worried, so I wasn't too worried. Well, I put off seeing my surgeon even though the area now felt \"heavy\" and was starting to hurt somewhat. Then in March, I got shingles--not relevant to the cancer, but I believe it was heaven's way of intervening so I could get the help I needed to diagnose this cancer early. I went in and asked about the rash which had appeared to have spread onto the flap skin of the reconstruction where it eventually turned into hard lumps that did indeed appear to be scar tissue. The PA I saw was concerned and sent me back to the GP who referred me to a local plastic surgeon. The plastic surgeon said she had never seen such a rash and sent me to a dermatologist who was convinced it was an infection of some type. She took a needle biopsy of two separate areas. Both came back as recurrent breast cancer and all the docs were floored. As it is rare, I think it would really take an experienced eye to suspect it. A third biopsy was done to determine hormone status and thank goodness it was estrogen positive. I was put on Femara which is working beautifully. If this were not a recurrence, I do believe I could get by on the Femara alone! But since it IS a recurrence, I will have to have the reconstructed area excised and radiated. (Due to kidney surgery decades ago, I will have to have skin grafts to cover the area as they cannot stretch the skin to cover the hole.) Then six weeks of radiation. That way, I can maybe zap it out for good. Long posting, but my point is when something does not occur very often, even the best might overlook it or attribute it to something else. My story is going to have a happy ending but only because Somebody intervened so things would fall into place and my recurrence would be found early. I do not blame anyone--not even myself--for thinking my \"spots\" were just scar tissue or a rash. Most of the time, that is exactly what it would be. No doctor can know it all. I am just lucky I got Shingles (whoever could imagine that illness could be \"lucky!\") and the ball got rolling: left up to me, I still would not have contacted my plastic surgeon as he is in the opposite side of the state and I would not have made the effort. (And even though he is one of the best in the business, there is not guarentee even he would have suspected.) Insist that you want to know for sure. I think the best way to tell if you have a recurrence or not is a PET scan, but you have to check with your insurance as that is really expensive. On a final note, and this is almost spooky: Once I saw that PA, the rash of the shingles remained, but I never felt any more shingle pain at all! And anyone who has had shingles can tell you, that is a miracle unto itself!",
