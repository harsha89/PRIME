    "Content": "Well I am right there with you, my husband just shaved my head lastnight. It was very freeing to know that I was a head of the chemo treatments I am going to be starting this friday 8/06/10. I had breast cancer and survived that and now I can survive this too. Plus my mom shaved her head also with me for support and she had really long hair. I had cut it short when I found out I had cancer to begin with. Brenda",
