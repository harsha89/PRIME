      "Content": "I had breast biopsy 4/7/10,on 4/15/10 MRI, then on 4/20/10 I had SONO node biopsy in office and DR hit my rib cage...OUCH (least it was not my lung)which was all NODE Neg.Then Blue dye breast injections on 4/22/10 and then on 4/23/10 I had surgery...lumpectomy and 2 nodes removed in armpit. Dr called on 4/27/10 (Our 19th Wedding Anniversary) with results that they got \"clear margins, and both nodes were negative. Tumor size was 1.1cm by .07cm. StageI no nodes, brac I and II are negative, but I am triple neg. /grade III. (should I have had a bi=lateral mastectomy?) I am going to my first post op appointment in the morning, and get my appointments with my Medical Oncologist & Radiation Oncologist to get my treatments going. They are saying i will be getting chemo and rads and will be inserting a port? It is normal for me to be so sore still in my armpit and breast? So how soon will my Chemo start? Any ball park ideas, ladies? I am getting scared again and find myself crying and sad worrying about the next 6 to 9 months during treatments? I had to start taking my Zanaxx more often..He's my BFF right now, my get up and go juice. lol Ironic since it makes you sleepy. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "I have finally made all the scans, biopsies, lumpectomy and port cath installed and now I have made it thru my LAST round of AC!!!!! I feel like I finally have hit a big marker in this long journey. My Onc says I can take 2 or 3 weeks off before I start Taxol, I chose to take only take 2 weeks off, I am ready to get these next 12 weekly rounds of Taxol done. I talked to a lady today that has got me freaked out about taking Taxol, with her allergic reaction she had during her first few infusions, and she is having vomitting and weak, aches and tired and had to go on dissibility at work because of her Taxol? I have continued to work all thru my AC treatments other than Fridays after so every other Friday I would take a sick day, when I went back in for my Neulasta Shot (which will be tomorrow......LAST one of those too) then I worked from home on MOnday and Tuesdays then worked Wednesday thru Friday, I work 5 or sometimes 6 hours a day. My job has been very supportive and accomidating about my sugeries, chemo and doctor appts. What can I expect with the Taxol, My Onc seems to think it will be a lot easier on me, since i did so well on the AC?",

I think i need to get a external hard drive for the laptop for adding more music. WTH? This morning i was having a bad day waiting for my zanaxx to kick in and a little sad and I also cook breakfast on Saturdays. Which i did not today....for may obvious reasons...I told him we need to go out today and do something fun, or even go to SAMS and get stuff. Central Market for some fresh fruits and veggies, bowling, movies anything. Because I was having a bad day emotionally. He says, urrrggghhh, you didn't cook breakfast and you were suppose too. I said I am sorry, i was having a bad day, and said OK I will get up and make something now. Never mind, he says. MEN....I love him but I don't know how he is taking all of this cancer news> I am having a lumpectomy next week, right now from my sono, MRI and core biopsy, Dr says it still looks good, stage I IDC, with in grade III cells. Then onto Chemo and Radiation. doing a sonogram on my lymph, cuz they look a little different, the they look the same on both sides and MRI shows small 1.3cm tumor only on one side, it is not worried, he just wants to look before surgery. How long will i be out of work with a lumpectomy with a few lymph removed?",
