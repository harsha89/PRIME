      "Content": "I had just lost close to 50 lbs when I was diagnosed in July 2015.  But part of my treatment was, of course, steroids!  And due to the steroids and lack of energy, 40 lbs of it came right back on! Yuck! My onco said it would come off as soon as I stopped the steroids, but it's not happening!  I have my final Herceptin treatment on Oct. 26th...Oh well, back to Weight Watchers next month!",

      "Content": "Grandmakath...I'm having the same issue!  The only way I could describe it to my onco was I felt like it was a very intense itching feeling, but more like I was being stuck with needles all over my arms and abdomen.  It started exactly 2 weeks to the day of my radiation.  He looked at me like I was crazy and said that should've happened while I was on chemo, not 2 months after my last chemo.  He's scheduled me with a dermatologist to see if I've developed any allergies from chemo, but from what I've been told and read, it's neuropathy of the nerves in my body.  Usually Gabapentin is prescribed for this.  I'll wait and see the dematologist, but from what I've read, I really should see a neurologist for this problem.  I'll keep you posted!",

      "Content": "Hi Grandma...Lol...I had a rash only one time!  It happened July 4th weekend!  It had been a year since I had had a drink.  It was hot here in GA that weekend and my husband was drinking a beer, which looked wonderful!  So, I grabbed me one and about 5 minutes later my husband looked at me and asked if I was ok.  I told him I felt like I was on fire.  He said I was bright red, and about 5 minutes later, my arms were all splotchy wherever I've had the \"itching\" problem. It was just my arms and only that one time.     ",

      "Content": "Hi mjord1...My lump was small (right at 2cm), but it turned out that I was triple positive, ER+/PR+/HER2+.  My oncologist said that since it came back HER@+ he wanted me to do chemo and radiation.  I was told before my lumpectomy that my chances of it coming back were between 10/12%, but when it came back HER2+, my oncologist told me those chances went up to between 30-35% of a recurrence.  I ended up doing chemo, radiation and just had my last Herceptin treatment on 10/26.  It's you body, your choice.  Ask your doctor if it was his wife, would he suggest the same treatment course to her.",
