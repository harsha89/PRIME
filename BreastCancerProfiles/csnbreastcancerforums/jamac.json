      "Content": "Hi. I was diagnosed with extensive multifocal DCIS last fall. One web site that I've found extremely helpful in helping me understand the disease and treatment options is Oncolink. If you click on cancer types you can get to breast cancer info and go from there. There is a lot of info about DCIS. Maybe you've already seen this site. Hope it helps you - it sure helped me. Take care. Julie",

      "Content": "I am almost 2 years out from my bc diagnosis and bil mastectomies and close to 1 year out from finishing my reconstruction with saline implants. I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what I'm feeling between my skin and my implants. Does scar tissue shift around in there? This feels like my scars but is not close to the external scars. ??? Last year I found a BB sized bump which turned out to be a bulge in the shell of my implant. I'm trying to be vigilant about doing BSE after being scolded for not doing it. Have any of you had the same experience? How do you know when to pay attention and when to wait and watch? I'd really like to hear from anyone with suggestions. Thanks in advance. Julie",
