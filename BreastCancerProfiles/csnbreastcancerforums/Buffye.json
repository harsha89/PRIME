    "Content": "I recently lost my mother this year, on July 24th. 2015, It is so hard for my family, hard for me, and the hardest part is finding out how to cope. My mom was my befriend, my baby, my Guardian Angel, and I miss her more then anything in this world and beyond. I never thought that I'd loose her this early in life... I always thought there was more time, closed my eyes and see her there for the Birth of my children, see her there for my wedding, but when I lost her, I close my eyes now, and I can No longer see those beautiful images. It kills me that she isn't here because it doesn't seem real, like I'm living someone else's nightmare. I don't and can't understand why me, why my family, why??? Everyday that I wake up its a struggle, a struggle to carry on with the day or even start...... I feel many days that I hate this life, and just want to sleep for the rest of this life. I think about the memories of my Mother, and never do I have a dry eye, my heart is tierd and my soul is sad. But somehow, with the depression and anxiety, and all other feelings, I feel this comfort in the day to get up, hoping and praying its my mom saying, \"get up baby, get up\". An with that I do, I rise for her, and I rise for my family. I've been taught so much by my parents, but Not have I ever been taught to live without them.... How do you do  that????  What Now????",
