      "Content": "I had a double \"skin sparing\" mast. (saved the nipples). If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have saved the nipples. They are just in the way. They are pretty much uncontrollable so you are at their mercy! It limits the bras I wear and some of the shirts I want to wear with the more comfortable bras. Just my opinion, but I think they just add another hassle.",

      "Content": "You sound just like me! I had terrible leg pain and took pain pills at night for them. My legs were weak also and I had a hard time getting up from a squat or even walking without looking funny! The hot flashes were terrible at night. HOWEVER, I have been on it for about 4 months and I have none of those symptoms now! I wasn't sure if the leg pain was residual from the chemo or not but I believe it was the Tamoxifen (I was a couple of months past chemo). So, for me, it was a little rough at first but now I'm not having a single side effect. Hang in there! Karla",
