      "Content": "Sandy, I agree with your point of view. It comes down to, \"Do you trust your doctor or not?\" When you read such different ways of handling what appears to be the same situation, it makes you wonder if your doctor was \"right\" or was the other person's doctor \"right.\" Could be that both are right. There are so many variables and each of our bodies are unique. It's unlikely a doctor is purposely doing something that he knows is \"wrong.\" Malpractice lawsuits are too prevalent in this country for a doctor to disreguard a patient's welfare or do something that differs radically from standard U.S. practice.   Unless that little voice inside starts to tell me something is wrong, I choose to believe my doctor is doing the best thing for me at this point in my treatment. That doesn't mean I blindly follow everything with no questions. No indeed. Each time I see him I have questions about something I've read about. I want to be a participant in this cancer journey and to learn as much as I can, but I have no problem speaking up if something is puzzling. I will also have no problem looking for another doctor even at this stage of the game if I have reason not to trust my doctor in the future.  ",

      "Content": "How do you support your drains? Many hospitals put you in a soft bra with pockets attached for the drain bulbs. If you aren't wearing the bra anymore, there are lots of ways to support the bulb and tubing so the drain doesn't pull against the suture site. I used several methods. You can use dental floss to make a LONG loop around your neck and attach the bulbs with safety pins. You can do the same thing with a long piece of flat wide elastic. (It's a little more comfortable than the dental floss for some people.) You can make your own pockets for the bulbs. Take a pair or two of socks, cut off about three or four inches from the toes and you have pockets that will hold drain bulbs. That way you don't have to unpin the drain itself, just take it out of the pocket to empty.  If you can find some baby diaper pins, they are perfect for pining and unpining the drains. The tiny thin ones are harder to deal with. I also bought some summer bandeau tops that were like comfortable strapless bras. I pinned the drains to them sometimes. Also been known to put the bulbs in my jeans pockets and tubing in my underwear. While they are always uncomfortable, they shouldn't hurt when you move unless something is pulling on the skin where the suture is. Do you wear a bra? Does it press on the suture or rub against it? How long is the tubing from your skin to the bulb? Usually it is very long, could be down to your thighs and can get hung up sometimes so the tubing pulls against the suture. Do you hold onto the tubing next to the suture while you are \"milking\" the drain? If not, it's easy to pull on the suture.",

The last drain finally came out at 21 days so I feel your pain! When you read other's stories, you see how different doctors are. Some take drains out quickly, others take them out even though the drain is still cranking out much more than yours or mine. Keep the faith...the drain WILL come out soon.",

      "Content": "Do you mean that 3 nurses tried to access a vein? Or do you have a port that malfunctioned? As someone who is a \"hard stick\" I sympathize and understand how you could be in tears. During the last hospitalization they tried 25 times...yes, 25 failed sticks, including in my feet. It was agonizing. They kept bringing in people from the ER and ICU, each claiming to be the best and promising they would be successful. I finally refused to have anyone else try and asked to see my surgeon. He agreed and ordered a PICC line to be placed. It's perfect, has two ports, one for IV's and the other for blood draws. As long as it is kept clean, the PICC team says you can keep it for a year or more. I've had mine two months. After about a month I got an occlusion in the line. Two nurses tried to draw blood but couldn't get it from either port so they said they would have to try to find a vein in my hand. Nope...two sticks, two fails...and those sticks in the hand really hurt. I was so upset, my blood pressure was sky high, and tears running down my face. Finally I asked to see the PICC team and sure enough, there was a substance they could use to unclog the PICC line. They were so sympathetic and said from now on I should come right to them whenever I needed a blood draw or dressing change. I would love to keep the PICC line forever but my PS wants it out since I finished with IV antibiotics a couple weeks ago. But I'm quite anemic and the oncologist ordered an iron infusion in a week so I'm allowed to keep it for now. My husband flushes each line with saline twice a day. Could you ask if they will place a PICC line for you? I have two more surgeries coming up to finish reconstruction as well as several blood draws in the meantime as we work on fixing some blood deficiencies. I was already dreading life without a PICC. The PICC line team told me this week that I should request to see them before any procedure in which I will need an IV started. Using the same technology as when the put in the PICC, they will use ultrasound to find a vein and start the IV. They can use it for simple blood draws too. I can't tell you how relieved I am. Could you request something like that too? With everything you are going through, it may seem odd to others that you would get upset when it took an hour to get an IV started. Those with \"good\" veins should thank their lucky stars. The last thing you need when you feel like crap is to have to go through that miserable process again. Wishing you good luck and no more unnecessary pain to add to your burden, Sandra  ",

      "Content": "My large regional military hospital uses both ports and PICC lines. Most chemo patients get ports, but not all. I've had a PICC line twice because I have developed terrible veins. After developing a bad infection, I had 25 unproductive sticks (even in my feet!) after my bilateral mastectomy. They brought in people from the ER and ICU to try but these \"uber-confident\" people fared no better. At 25 tries over 2 hours, I put my foot down, said NO MORE and demanded to see my doctor. My doctor agreed with me. She was mad that the nurses had put me through the torture of 25 sticks. She ordered a PICC line for IV antibiotics and blood transfusions. I went home after a week still on the IV antibiotics for a month. I kept it through a second surgery (because of damage done by the infection) and then two months more for continued IV antibiotics and for iron infusions due to anemia. I would have liked to keep it a month longer for my third surgery, but my plastic surgeon was worried about infection and preferred that I have it taken out and then replaced the day before surgery. The PICC team nurses told me a PICC line can stay in several years as long as it is maintained properly but we had to go with what the doctor ordered. I had the PICC line for several weeks after surgery 3 to get more IV antibiotics to avoid another infection. I'll have surgery 4 in March and will get one again the day before surgery. For me, they are wonderful to have and easy to maintain, once you are taught. My husband learned how to do the IV antibiotics and flush the lumens (I had two - one for antibiotics, the other for blood draws.) It's easy. Getting one put in is not a big deal. They do need to be put in by a specialty nursing team using sterile techniques, but you don't have to be in an operating room or be sedated. They use an ultrasound to find the bracchial vein inside your upper right arm, then give you a little shot of lidocaine, mixed with saline so it's a little short sting, not a big one. The soft PICC line is fed into the vein, up to your shoulder, across your chest and down towards your heart. You get two sutures to hold the line in place. They do an x-ray to make sure everything is in the right place and that's it. The dressing needs to be changed by the PICC team at 24 hours and thereafter once a week. I did have a series of visiting nurses every other day at home for blood draws and two of them did dressing changes. I did not think the last one did a good job and was suspicious of her sterile techniques, so I chose to go back to the hospital's PICC team each week for perfect cleaning and dressing changes. They were happy to do it. I had to go for saline fills in my tissue expander each week anyway, so it was no trouble for me.  It is to be kept away from water so you have to wear a waterproof shower sleeve, which is mildly annoying after a while, but no big deal. There are companies that make PICC line covers in an assortment of colors and fabrics since most people have them for months and months and get tired of the white stretchy mesh the hospital gives you. It doesn't hurt AT ALL to have it or get it taken out. You don't feel it. You will have a little scar from the two sutures and a tiny dot scar from the PICC line itself, but they fade quickly.",
