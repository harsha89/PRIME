    "Content": "Hello, ladies. Question for you. I have been taking Tamoxifen for almost 2 years now. I developed bleeding (just once) and the lining of my uterin wall thickened by 3x. Doctor said Tamoxifen can do that. I see him (Dr) Monday and he will be asking if I want to change this medication. Has anyone else had this happen to them? I noticed some discussion about Tamoxifen use. I have night sweats all night, waking me 5-7 times each night. Also have sweats during the day. I take Vit E twice a day. Needless to say, fatigue is a real issue. I also still struggle with cognitive challenges since chemo (finished 2 years ago). Memory is a real problem at times. Anyone else still struggling with that?",
