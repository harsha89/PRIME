      "Content": "I cannot begin to imagine what that family is going through. To watch a child go through treatment would be harder than I could begin to imagine. When I see a commercial on TV about St. Judes and they show children with Cancer, they give me so much strength. I pray God will give peace that passes all understanding to that family and to all who knew him. Isnt it amazing how many lives that little boys life touched in just 6 short years? It makes me want to be the best I can be, and to appreciate every day. God has given me 51 years so far. Now I want to do something good with every minute. Carter is an angel! He is with his heavenly Father, no more pain, no more tears, no more sadness. He will be greatly missed but NEVER FORGOTTEN!",

Keep positive thoughts, smile, and know that the strength that brought you here and the compassion and determination that kept you here to encourage others, is the same strength, and determination that will get you through this again. You may have mets but they dont have you! Our prayers, go with you. As many have said before, there are no words to tell you what you have meant to all of us, and I truly beleive if it were possible, most of us would physically come to your side. You have given Sooooo much...... in my heart, you represent the CHIEF WARRIOR! Lots and lots of good thoughts, prayers, hugs, coming your way..... God will never take you to, where he cannot take you through.",

      "Content": "I have not been on here to post for quite sometime. I have been able to read posts once in awhile. I lost my Dad last Monday the day after Father's Day. He went from doing better to loosing him within about 10 hours. They originally thought he has until around July 15th, but he only lasted about a week. There was no indication that he was declining and I CERTAINTLY DID NOT EXPECT TO LOOSE HIM SO SOON. I miss him dearly, we were always very close. This past year has been quite the battle. I was diagnosed with BC at the end of November and my Dad took a turn for the worse the week before Christmas. He spent most of his time in a chair. He stayed about the same and then Hospice was called in about 2 months ago. Dad never thought he needed hospice, but my Mom needed some help. No one ever said, he was terminal. However, Beginning in April my schedule has pretty much been, Treatment, work and going to my parents. I am still going through radiation and am about at the half way mark. I have eating really bad due to all that has been going on. In the midst of all of this, actually the day of My Dad's viewing I find out my Husband has been writting love letters to another woman and was barred from going to where she works while she is working. If it were not for my faith in Christ, I hate to think where I would be today. You all have been on my heart and in my prayers and hopefully I will be able to be on here more. What my Dad had, if he had it today he would take antibiotics. Because what he had happened in the late 50's he had a lung removed, and a blood transfusion that infected him with Hep C which caused cirrosis of the liver (he never drank alcohol), which ulimately took his life.",
