    "Content": "58 years old woman - breast cancer - (after 4x AT chemo, radiotherapy, surgery - breast and lymph node removal, ER+ tumors). Today, after a year of being cancer free, she has ovary and bone metastasis, and is taking nevalbine (vinorelbine), zoledronic acid, and arimidex (anastrozole). Last time she was in the hospital to take NVB, the doctor told her to stop taking arimidex. I have no idea why, are there any interactions between ari and nvb? She is responding to the treatment well, and is in good overall condition. I am asking, because cancer treatment conditions in Poland are horrible, and I don't trust medical personnel here. It turned out that they ignored the meta-tumors that were visible on tomography for like 5 months before restarting the treatment, and they totally don't care about the patients. Thanks for any attempts to help.",
