    "Content": "Hi, I am 37yrs. old and recently diagnosed at stageIII b/c. I am totally frightened of what the future holds and I am finding great comfort on this website. I guess I am reaching out to see if anyone has been diagnosed as Her2+++. It seems to be a stinky situation to be in. (as is all b/c diagnosis.) Thank you to all you women who have given me the courage to actually be able to want to talk about this.",
