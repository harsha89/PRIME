    "Content": "The doctor told me that Taxotere was less agressive so I did not need the nausea drugs. I expected it to be easier to handle. Don't let your wife fall into that idea. Chemo is cumulative so I found Taxotere to be just as draining. What I did find to be different was that I would not get the side effects til 2 days after treatment. The side effects lasted a little longer. For taxotere, there is heartburn and finger numbing. Other people experienced worse side effects than that. I also found that my eyes became weepy. But, the good news is that its only for a short while!",
