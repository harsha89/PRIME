You deserve a better quality of life - pain free. Hang in there. We will all be thinking of you on Monday night when you have to drink the aweful stuff. One thing about the test, the prep is the worst part. God Bless, Kathy",

      "Content": "Hello, I can't help you with the chemo question, but I can empathise with the recurrence. I made it almost 9 years, when I was rediagnosed in 98. Stage IV this time. Going through treatment takes over your life for awhile, but I refused to let it define who I am. You will get your life back. Concentrate on the good things around you and your support system. Keep your attitude up as best you can, but cry when you need to. My husband has been the best and we are closer now than ever, having weathered this storm together. Talk to someone about your feelings. We are all here for you. You will find at least one woman, but I bet several, that you will just click with, and make a lasting friendship. I'm usually on the site everyday, except weekends, so feel free to contact me. God Bless, Kathy",

      "Content": "Hi Cathy, I went through the same thing earlier this year. I've been on tamoxifen for 3 years, almost four now and am pre-menopausal. My periods used to be regular, but now they come and go. Earlier I had a month where I was spotting every week, so they did the biopsy. I think it scared my husband more than me when I went home and told him, but everything was fine. I have asked for a hysterectomy, but neither my gyn or onc will approve it. Right now my period has stopped for awhile again, but when it comes back, it usually comes back with a vengenance. Oh, the \"wonders\" of menopause. I can't wait to get through it altogether. Hang in there, we're all in this together. Hope this helps. God Bless, Kathy",

There are plenty of survival stories of those of us who have beaten cancer multiple times, but it does everyone's heart and faith good to hear it one more time! It keeps it fresh and alive in our minds that if you can do it, then so can we. God is a mighty God and faithful. May He continue to richly bless you. God Bless, Kathy",

      "Content": "Tara, Whatever information I get on the internet I take to my oncologist and discuss it with her. If not for these sites, there is info out there I would never have had access to. Your doctor cannot possibly give you all the info. We, as patients, have to be our own advocates of our health. I believe knowledge is power. The more you know and understand the disease, the more you can decide what is right for you. There is information on the web, that the medical community wouldn't agree with, but after speaking with your doctor, I believe that ultimately it should be my decision on what care treatments I opt for. Medicine is still a science, therefore, all the research has not been done and all the answers haven't been obtained. This site lets me know that I am not alone in this battle. I've been a part of support groups. They helped me, but this site I can log onto anytime of the day or night, in the privacy of my home, and find help. That is so positive! I've made many good friends here. Friends I would have never met in my usual walk of life because of distance. Our shared experiences know no distance. We are bound by them. God Bless, Kathy",

      "Content": "Hi Linda, That is such a personal decision. Talk with the doctors and ask for the low down on survival of hormonal therapy vs chemo. I opted not to take chemo and I have to say, my cancer did return with a vengenance (StageIV) but I opted again not to do chemo and I am very healthy and coming up on my 7th year as Stage IV with the tumors gone. Praise the Lord. However, I will say I am the exception to the rule. Most women opt for the chemo and get through it with the help of family and friends. Let your heart be your guide and do whatever is the best for Kerri. God Bless, Kathy",

      "Content": "Leenie, Welcome to the site. I found my lump right before Thanksgiving when I was 35. My husband was out of town, I was feeling great and was going to dismiss the whole thing. However, when my husband came back the next week, I asked him to feel and see if he felt the same thing. To make a long story short, he made me go have it checked out, because I was just going to watch it. No history of cancer in my family, etc. When the diagnosis came back, cancer, it was harder for my husband to accept than me, for the fact that I was so healthy! He said if I had been sick or if there were any other symptoms, it would have been easier on him than to watch the doctors make me sick in order to cure! Right now it is normal to have the feelings you are experiencing. We have all been there and we can tell you time will make it better, but it will be a gradual process. You mark time in small increments. When you can increase the time in between visits to the doctor, then when you have passed the six month marker, then the year, etc. Right now time seems slowed down, but it will speed up again very soon. Your energy will come back and you will run a marathon again, if you choose. In the meantime, allow your body to heal and savor the downtime. Life does go on and you will make it. God Bless, Kathy",
