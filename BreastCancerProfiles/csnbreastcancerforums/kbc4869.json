    "Content": "Hi Joyce, You already know a little about me, but here goes: I enjoy writing and am probably a better writer than I am a verbal communicator. I have a tendency to be a bit abrupt in real life because I'm inpatient and always in a hurry to get what ever it needs done. I'm half practical and half creative. I enjoy playing the piano, gardening, decorating, and cooking for my family and close friends. I have an endless to-do list and like organization. I'm an introvert and really do prefer the time I spend by myself or on a one-on-on basis. Large crowds and socializing sap my energy. I'm a bit fiery when it comes to protecting the ones I love and I'm a very loyal friend. I have a strange sense of humor, and come from a close-knit family. I have been married for two years and am the mother of a two year old little girl who is a real handful. I work full time in a corporate environment, in which I will probably never excel at because I am far too honest and not a good *** kisser. And that's ok with me. Look forward to chatting to you soon! Thank you for your interesting questions. We sure have sparked some great discussions lately! xoxo, Kim",
