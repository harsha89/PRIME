      "Content": "I don't know if I can be of much help with this . . . if she goes to an \"out-of-network\" place, would she be paying a higher amount, or would her insurance not cover anything (unless she can talk them into it)? I would definitely want to be at the place where I felt I would be getting the BEST care! I was unhappy with the first surgeon I talked to - and within hours, was already talking to someone at a different cancer center where I did end up getting my care - so glad that I did that. Do you think the American Cancer Society site may have some links to someone who could help with pursuing that? Hope she gets to the place where she feels that she is getting the best care possible. With thoughts & prayers, ♥ Lynn ♥",

I'm at the point where I don't feel like I should keep talking about the emotions and all that linger on . . . and I'm also on Arimidex for the next 5 years, so I don't know if I'll see side effects from that or not. But . . . this is where I can come to talk about all the things that stay with me - emotions & all - and know that all of you have those same issues that you're dealing with . . . just what we've been through, what we're dealing with now (even if it seems to others that, for some of us, we're past the \"being sick\" part of it all), and not knowing what the future holds . . . and just keeping each other in our thoughts & prayers . . . means SO MUCH!! I know that we're all at different places in this journey - but that doesn't matter - what matters is that, like Ayse said, everyone cares so much about the others - this truly is a wonderful site!
