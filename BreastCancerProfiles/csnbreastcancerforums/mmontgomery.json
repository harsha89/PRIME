    "Content": "I had a mastectomy also after a lumpectomy in July 2001. I researched all the possibilites for reconsturction. The only option for me was the Tram Flap. I'm very active and very independent and those first few weeks after surgery was nasty, but a year and half later I have results that I can live with for the rest of my life. It is very natural looking. The scars took a while to get used to and so did the numbness, but for me it was the right choice.",
