      "Content": "Jean Well side effects can be different for each person, here is my experience. I was on taxotere, carboplatin, and hercepterin. I just finished my last on June 17th (6 total). The sleeplessness due to steroids only lasted the 3 days around chemo. Then, I slept pretty well through the entire course of treatments. For the most part, the side effects were similar every time. Around day 4, nausea, dizzyness, overall fatigue. this would last about 1 week, then i would start feeling much better. Food was not appealing the first week, but I learned that yogurt and fresh fruit always tasted the best (and believe me, i was not a yogurt, nor fruit eater before!). I also indulged in ice cream when nothing else worked. My taste buds are coming back slowly. The effects were definitely cumulative as I felt much more fatigued after treatments 5 and 6. I have bounced back quite rapidly (it has been 12 days since my last treatment); however, I think it is the joy of knowing I have no more! Just hang in there and remember the effects will go away and you will not always feel like this. Question for all - anybody have alot of discharge from eyes about 1.5 weeks after each chemo? i have this constant stream of \"tears\".",

      "Content": "I have been using Nioxin products throughout my chemo - ever since most of my hair fell out 3 months ago. My hairdresser recommended and told me to use even if I had no hair. I did not lose all my hair, but it is pretty sparse. However, the hair that I have has grown from about 1 mm long (from when we first shaved it off) to about 1/2 inch long during my chemo treatments. I am on taxotere, carboplatin, and hercepterin. I was told these drugs often do not cause total hair loss - so am not sure if the hair growth is due to nioxin, or the fact that my hair would have grown anyway. One more treatment to go, then I anticipate having a luxurious mane of hair again :)",
