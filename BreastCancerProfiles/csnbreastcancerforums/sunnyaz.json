    "Content": "I am going to take advise from all of you. I will do more with my family. Show them more appreciation, call them more and let them know how much I love them. I will exercise more regularly and eat more healthy too. This year I will raise twice as much money in the Relay For Life to create more birthdays for the American Cancer Society. I will lead my Team Captains to a Victorious event experience and touch as many hearts as I can. But most of all I vow to Live, Laugh and Love..... while I still can. Blessings for a Happy Healthy New Year to all of you, Julie-SunnyAZ",
