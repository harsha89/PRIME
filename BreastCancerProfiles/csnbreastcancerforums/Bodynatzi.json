    "Content": "Wondering how many of you have a larger breast in the one with the lumpectomy?  I had a lumpectomy and radiaiton a little over 2 years ago and my breast is still tender and larger than the other one.  My surgeon said it is not uncommon.  Sorry all of you are having the same painful problems but I'm not as worried about it now.  Just wondering how many of you have a larger breast along witht he pain?  Most people I know that have been thru this have a smaller breast! Going to be hard buying new bra's.  Thanks for any input......",
