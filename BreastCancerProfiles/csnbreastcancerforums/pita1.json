      "Content": "I was diagnosed with BC in March, had a lumpectomy and then 7 nodes removed. I have 5 more radiation treatments out of 33 to go and my onc wants me to go on tamoxifen...(I am seeing him tomorrow to discuss this). I am considering not taking it...I can't stand the thought of depression (and more drugs for them!) and more hot flashes (had a hysterectomy in 1989, I was on premarin for 13 years) (And MORE drugs!) My onc printed a baseline prognosis from MayoClinic.com based on my information. The estimated 10 year survival rate if NO adjuvant therapy was given, is 81%. With Tamoxifen, 85.4%. It seems like a small percentage considering all the side effects I would have to suffer through. I have never tolerated drugs well and feel it might not be worth it, to take a drug for 5 years. Any thoughts? I'm confused and scared, with no real support of any kind that I can discuss this with. Thanks",
