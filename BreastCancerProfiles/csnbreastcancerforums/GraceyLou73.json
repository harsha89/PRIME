      "Content": "My diagnosis was a punch in the gut like I've never felt before.  I've learned a lot going through 6 rounds of chemo, surgery, and now radiation and continued chemo.  Lots of side effects but can be managed if you know what to expect.  The nurses and the ACS website were great but found some other sources to help.  Happy to share or answer any questions you might have.  It's all still really fresh in my mind.  ",
