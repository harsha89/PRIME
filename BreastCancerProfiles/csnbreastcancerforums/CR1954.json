      "Content": "I watched my father lie in a hospital bed in our living room for 6 months, dying of lung cancer. I was 10 years old. Back then, the idea was DON'T TELL THE PATIENT THAT THEY ARE TERMINAL. It was in fact, rare for doctors or family to break the bad news to the patient. So, as a kid, I watched all of this going on around me, and was admonished repeatedly not to tell Dad that he wasn't going to make it. I watched and waited and kept my mouth shut, not fully understanding everything that was going on. I'm sure he knew though. How could he not? I don't think I care to watch anything like that again, even on television. I would rather watch a sit-com......... CR",

As far as the split skin, they told me that it was not uncommon to have the burned skin actually split and create an open sore. They warned me that it might happen so that I wouldn't panic over it if it did. Thankfully, it did not. Also, on my last day of rad, they gave me a \"diploma\" tied with pink ribbon...lol!

The next time I went, four months later, there were obvious outward changes to the breast and then I was basically treated like....why didn't you come in sooner? I almost said \"I told you so\"!

Inasmuch as the weekend is now here, and it will be a couple of days before I can have anything done if it gets extremely uncomfortable, I am looking for suggestions.

They then placed a metal \"marker\" where they had done the biopsy and said that they wanted to do another MRI in 6 months to see if anything had changed in the area. This was close to the chest wall, and I know that the facility that I go to has one of only four MRI breast coils in the country, that allow a good view of lesions which are close to the chest wall. So, I am not sure...only going by what they told me at the time. This did not show up on mammogram. But it did on MRI. CR",

It hurts that she appears to go the other way when she sees me now. And it hurts that even her emails have stopped coming. But even though it hurts, I think that her reaction is out of fear. Fear that it could happen to anyone. I can't imagine any other reason for her reaction. So, if and when she ever decides that she wants to re-establish that bond again, I will be here. CR",

Has gone to chemo with me and even went clothes shopping with me after my mastectomy to help me find tops. I have another sister who has severe health issues of her own and is basically housebound. She did try to stay in touch by phone, but I stopped having conversations with her because frankly, it was too depressinfg hearing about her health while worrying about my own. Another sister, the closest in age to me, stopped calling or asking about me, when she saw me with \"tremors\" and not looking so great during chemo. If I should run into her anywhere now, she simply says hi, then walks away. I think in her case, it's fear that keeps her away. I don't know. My brother and his wife...the STRONG ones in the family, and the man who took over basically, when my father died (I was 10 at the time) were in constant contact with me and very encouraging. Which I really needed. I needed him to tell me that I COULD DO THIS! And he did. Well, about halfway through chemo, I stopped hearing from him. I get the occasional email joke yet, but nothing else. I'm not sure if he and my sister-in-law have their own life to deal with, if they lost interest or if they just figure I don't need more encouragement or whatever. I guess you just never know how family, or friends for that matter, will act and react. I'm very thankful for the help and love that I have had from one sister, but I'm kind of bewildered by how the others have acted. It makes me doubly appreciative of my husband and my grown kids. CR",

I'm not sure what motivates your sister to act the way she does. Maybe Jackie, she thinks that you are too strong, too capable, invincible? Whatever the reason, maybe you could sit down and talk to her and tell her that you have needs too...that you could use some help, both physically and emotionally.

I did not know what to say anymore. I had no help to give. And worst of all, the fear that I felt just seemed to overwhelm me when I came here. The more afraid I became, the more deporessed I became, until finally, family members asked me not to come here for a bit...until I could regroup. So, I stayed away, although I kept in touch with some sisters whom I met here. Many of you are my friends on facebook, where we were/are still connected through CSN, but we could have fun and go for long periods of time without thinking about cancer. And it was working. I was feeling much better about things and the constant terror abated. Then someone I have known since childhood, passed from cancer this past summer. And the terror returned. Over time, it subsided and I could get it out of my head for awhile. Then a dear sister here developed mets...and my terror was not just for me, but for her. She has been doing very well, thank God, and the fear subsided again. Another family friend, age 51, was then taken by cancer. She was such a brave warrior, right until the end. But all I could picture in my mind, was myself in her place. It was just horrible. And the overwhelming fear almost did me in, this time. And the losses on this board. Incredibly painful. I have been able to finally push past the fear and the sadness each time. But it always seems that just as I am moving on with my life, BAMMM! Here it comes again. Someone I know or care about is stricken or dies. As I just told a sister, it always loops around and I am right back where I started...terrified. At any rate, I THOUGHT that by staying away from the board, I could forget and \"get on with my life\". Stay away from the unpleasantness of cancer and of losing those I care about. Stay away from all of the things that cause me such terror that there are times when I can't catch my breath. What I have, in fact discovered, is that none of us are let off the hook that easily. That no matter where we go or how far we run from it, we will never again have the peace in our lives that we took for granted before we developed cancer. For me, the fear will always be there. The sadness will always be there. The reality of this hideous disease will always be there, whether I frequent the board or stay away. CR",

They didn't know, but said that we would know when it was time. We agonized over when to have her euthanized. She then filled with fluid and her heart gave out when she got up to get a drink. From when she let on that something was wrong and was dx'd, she was only with us for 3 more days. My best advice, from someone has who had many, many wonderful dogs, is that even though it is so terribly difficult and one of the saddest things that you will ever do, let your sweet Bodhi go before it gets worse. Especially if that is what your vets are saying (and you trust them). I say that because retrievers are very good at keeping pain to themselves. They will suffer in silence and you will not know just how much Bodhi is going through. And I say with all sincerity that our Samantha had been suffering for quite some time before we ever knew that something was wrong. She never let on until the cancer was so advanced that she suddenly filled with fluid and couldn't breathe. How we wish that we could have ended the suffering that she had to have been goung through sooner...but although she shared our home and our family, she just never acted sick. If you decide to wait, ask the vet for medication to make him as comfortable as possible, because I can guarantee you that he is in pain. Whatever you decide to do, God bless you, your family and Bodhi.... Hugs, CR",
