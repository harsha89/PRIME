      "Content": "I'm having the Taxotere with my Adriamycin and Cytoxan, so I'm not sure if it's the whole combination or what. But, I think it's the Taxotere that gives me muscle aches or bone pain that makes my muscles ache. It's usually only in my lower back and legs, and only lasts for day 3 and part of day 4. I have not experienced any numbness yet, and I'm now going through my 3rd out of 6 cycles. I also have the heartburn from day 5 through day 8. Tums helps me through that, so far. Tell her good luck and she's almost there!",
