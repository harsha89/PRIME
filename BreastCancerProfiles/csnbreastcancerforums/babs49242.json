      "Content": "Well, I am opposite than the women who posted. I do a lot of things by myself. I am a born again Christian,Loving spouse, Mom, Nana, sister. I enjoy volunteering one on one, artist in music,gardening and needlework. I do not talk much, more of a listener, so I keep a lot of things to myself, I keep a journal. I love large dogs and told hubby that if the Lord takes him home b4 me I will get a BIG dog. I do enjoy camping in the rough...no modern conveniences. I love to travel esp Ghana, Africa. Such a simple life. I am happy that I found this forum, I think I have been here since I was DX in 2004. I'm pretty laid back, not much bothers me. I love the ppl here..so open and loving. I think NOT being face to face helps me if not others to express ourselves. Have a wonderful Easter :) Cindie",
