    "Content": "I had Neulasta 4 times after A/C treatments. I didn't have any significant bone pain or headaches. I did have very bad bone pain and muscle ache while on Taxol and having to take Neulasta with that. It was extremely painful...I had to take pain medication for it and it lasted longer after each Taxol treatment. I am guessing it depends on the chemotherapy treatment...at least that's what it did to me. I hope you feel better soon. You'll soon grow to count on the great people this board. They have been a huge support for me. LorettaB",
