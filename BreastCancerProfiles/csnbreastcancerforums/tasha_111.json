But they said my breasts were too dense for the mammogram. Call me a wuss but that mammogram nearly did me in, and that was BEFORE I had all this surgery, chemo and radiation. I am sure that I will not be able to stand it as I am still very lumpy and VERY tender there. And it won't show anything anyway. What is the point? Can I get away with NOT doing this?
