      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy on Friday and sleeping on my back and breathing deep hurts. Has anyone else had this problem? I can only sleep on my right side and even that hurts. I have to lay my arm on my incision and of course that hurts also. I know that I am the world's biggest whimp (no lie! I have a very low pain tolerance level) but I didn't expect to have trouble breathing.",

      "Content": "I was put on Tamox. in January and besides hot flashes have had no problems until this summer. I have had migraines for almost 30 years and take medicine for them. This summer they just got so bad and so often that I called my onc. 9 days straight with no end in sight. I went off the Tamoxifen for about 4 days. When they still didn't go away I went back on it. I had about two good weeks after that where they stopped for the most part. My onc. thought it might be a sinus infection and I had an mri and saw a neurologist. Nothing on mri. Then they started again and lasted for a month I stopped tamox. again the end of August and have felt \"normal\" again. Now the onc. wants me back on tamox. and the neurologist is putting me on topimax to help the headaches. I have never had a problem taking medicine but I have to say that I am very apprehensive about taking this again. Anyone else have problems with migraines and tamoxifen? What helped?",

My heart is heavy with the thought of losing you even though we've never met face to face. I can only be comforted by the fact that you will be out of pain and that there will surely be another angel in heaven to watch over all of us kindred spirits. It's time to spread your wings and fly. Be at peace Chen. You will be sorely missed!! Helen",

I would not be worried about it being hard except it isn't hard where they took the lump from. It's even higher than the incision and below it. There is no redness or oozing from the incision. It's just started to get more tender and sore these last 4-5 days. The lump was small and they didn't have to take out much more than the size of a grape. Anyone else have this problem or know anything about it?",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed 3 weeks after my mother-in-law died. For about 8 months my husband kept blaming me for getting cancer. \"I haven't been able to mourn my mother because of this.\" Like I asked God to give me breast cancer right then. He told me this at least once a month. Then he lost his job right before my mastectomy/reconstruction. I had the TRAM flap done and was home for 2 1/2 months. About 5 into my healing process he hurt his back and I wound up taking care of him. Then he decided to havg out with his buddy until 3-4am. He would wait until 10pm and the kids and I went to bed and stay out in our garage until 3-4am. Sometimes I would come home from work and he would still be in bed from the night before. We started therapy and I told him that this guy was like an affair. He thought it was ok because he was home and he waited until we go to bed. Took me a year to get it through his head that this guy he was hanging with was bad news and I didn't want him around my house. My hubby is an alcoholic and a very weak person so this guy can lead him almost anywhere, he started drinking again but only a beer now & then. I'm very scared he'll get back into it. He already started smoking cigarettes again. So things have been better between us for about 2 months. Then my father died very unexpectedly 6 weeks ago. This hit me extremely hard. Hubby was there for my for about 2 weeks then he started back in again with his friends. He knows how much I dislike this guy J so he started to hang out with G (who used to hang out with the both of them). Only now he has to go to G's house and doesn't get home until 3:30am. He will only text these two guys and then makes sure to erase those texts so I can't read them. Yesterday I took my daughter to softball practice and when I came home J was at my house. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. I know that he's selfish and it really hurt me that he wasn't there for me during my diagnosis and 6 surgeries. He even admitted in therapy that he was there physically but emotionally he was gone. In December on the 1 year anniversary of my mastectomy he asked me when I was going to get over it and said \"I thought you'd be happy to be cancer free for one year.\" I told him that I was cancer free in October when I had my lumpectomy, that this was the anniversary of me losing part of who I was as a woman. He just doesn't get it and I can't find a way to make him understand. I'm fed up and sick of all of it. I've had enough loss in my life lately but I feel like I'm being pushed to make one more big move, this one is pushing him out of my house. He ws out of work for 16 months and I was the one looking for jobs for him, submitting resumes' and looking online. I'm not sure how I feel about him anymore, I try to feel love but it just seems to be harder and harder to find. Thanks for listening to this rant, I feel a little better now.",
