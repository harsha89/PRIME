      "Content": "I have not ordered from them, but have used another web-based supplier, after buying from a local shop several times. I think it best to buy at a shop first, so you can see some of the products and get some advice (remembering that it is still \"sales talk\") from the clerks. There are several places on the net that sell a wide variety of supplies. I think you'll find a few major brands, sold by a number of suppliers. Prices do vary, so shop around. I used Metro Medical at metromedicalonline.com. They had great customer service and good prices on what I wanted, with a pretty wide selection. I was trying to match a prosthesis, as I am \"bilateral\" and had one of my two spring a leak. I also found cheap, weighted foam ones for swimming. They are not great, but will do. Anyone know of cheap ones that are OK to swim in and don't take days to dry?",

      "Content": "Houston, Texas, has two \"chains\" of stores that may also exist in other cities that carry mastectomy supplies. The one I've shopped at is Women's Health Boutique. I highly recommend them. The other is Second Silouette. Our local ACS has a list of mastectomy/lumpectomy/wig, etc. supply stores. Contact your local office and see if they have such a list.",
