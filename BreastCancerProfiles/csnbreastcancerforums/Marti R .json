    "Content": "Loved your story!! It reminded me of another one I heard, similar scenario... Same beginning, although the little man is a little bit bigger (six inches instead of three). A man walks into a bar and says, \"Bartender, give me two shots.\" Bartender says, \"You want them both now or one at a time?\" The guy says,\" Oh, I want them both now. One's for me and one's for this little guy here,\" and he pulls a tiny six inch man out of his pocket. Bartender says: \"Wow!\" The man says, \"You haven't even seen what this little man can do!\" He takes a miniature piano from his other pocket and says: \"He plays the piano too!\" And sure enough, when he puts the miniature piano down on the bar, the 6 inch man immediately begins to play, and beautifully!! The guy sitting next to the first man says: \"Hey that's amazing! Where ever did you get him?\" The first man says: \"I was out in front of this bar, and I simply turned around 3 times, made my wish, and presto...there was this little man in my pocket!\". Second guys says: \"Wow that's worth a try!\" So he runs out of the bar...he is gone for about 90 seconds, then comes back in, looking all dejected. First guy: \"What's the matter?\" Second guy: \"I did what you said! I ran outside, turned around 3 times, and wished for a million bucks! All of a sudden, the sky was full of ducks! Not bucks...DUCKS! I wished for a million bucks, but got a million DUCKS instead!\" First guy: \"Well, you don't think I wished for a six inch PIANIST, do you?\"",
