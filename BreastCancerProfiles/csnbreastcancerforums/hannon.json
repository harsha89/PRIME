    "Content": "this is my first time using a chat room, i am desperatly trying to find out how to have myself and my five year old tested for the breast cancer gene. I lost my mum at christmas and her older sister died a few years ago from the disease. Another sister has just had her second breast removed. I would like to find out if i have this gene or if my daughter has it. There seems to be little information on the subject in ireland. Any help would be greatly appreciated..",
