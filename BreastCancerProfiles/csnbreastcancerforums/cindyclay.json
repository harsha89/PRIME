    "Content": "Hi Gayle: I had a bilateral mastectomy in September. We started the reconstruction at that time, so I had the latis. procedure. Using my lat. muscles in my back and bringing them around to my chest. I had two drainage tubes in the front and two in my back. I did not even feel it when they took my tubes out. I think it was about four days after surgery that I got my tubes out. Are you having any reconstruction done? Good Luck - Cindy C.",
