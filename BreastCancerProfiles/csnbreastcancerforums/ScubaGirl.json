    "Content": "Today I had my first chemo. Three of my girlfriends gave me a ring this morning engraved with the most beautiful passage. It reads, \"what cancer cannot do...steal eternal life...conquer the spirit...suppress memories...kill friendships...cripple love...corrode faith...shatter hope...destroy peace...silence courage...invade the soul\". It is the most touching gift I have ever received from a friend and I am grateful to be blessed with the friendship of these fantastic women. I hope that all of you have a Pam, Amy and Jami in you lives.",
