      "Content": "Hi there Wendy, I had a craniotomy a full blown skull base surgury done that lasted 11 hours and I was able to post a week later. So try to relax it can be done lol. Your head in general will not hurt where the inecsion will be but your face may feel a numb like youve had a shot of novacaine at the dentist. I had from the top of head side of face and tounge but its very workable. And hey your having it done at one of the 2 best locations in the world did you know that.=) Are they going to give you Proton Beam therapy after surgury or have you discussed this yet. If you have any questions im ill be more than happy to talk with you about the surgury. I know as having Brain cancer as my primary cancer it can be a bit hard to deal with. But it can be done and overpowered sooooo hang in there and know im out here thinking about you and your family and wishing you wellness. Belinda",
