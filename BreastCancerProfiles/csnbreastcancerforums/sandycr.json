    "Content": "I had a double mastectomy on 10/6/09 with reconstruction, with 2 drains on each side. Keep the pain meds consistent to keep the discomfort under control. You didn't mention the type of reconstruction you were having but that is where I felt and am still feeling the most discomfort. I have the Tissue Expanders.I had family caring and cooking for me for 2 weeks then tapered off by the third week. Husband has been handling household chores including cooking since then, what a great man I have. Driving, I started on my 3rd week but very limited because of the limited range of motion in my arms. A positive attitude and lots of prayers will get you through. My thoughts and prayers are with you and will be with you on Thursday. On the morning of surgery imagine yourself wrapped in a blanket of love made up of all of your new friends. Sandy :)",
