      "Content": "i have just read your posting and feel for you. i have had a similar situation. i am finished with my treatment so i am beginning to get over some of my cousins and their non-interest in my cancer diagnosis. just as an example, my sister in law did not call me once during my chemo or my radiation and she is a nurse! my brother called me once. yeah, it really hurts. i have come to think that they are not intentionally being jerks they just don't think or know any better. so that still makes them jerks, doesn't it? it was always interesting to me what friends and family came forward when i was sick. as one person wrote, it is their loss. it is not you, it is them. your immediate family sounds as though they have been a wonderful support to you. give yourself permission to moan and groan and carry on and get it out of your system. you are obviously a very caring and loving person and i know will continue to be a joy to your family. you obviously are not alone in this problem. love, peggy",
