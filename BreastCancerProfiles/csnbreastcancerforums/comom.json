      "Content": "Hello everyone, I have been frequenting this site since last fall and have found a tremendous support group. Although I have not gotten to know anyone personally, I have read many of your posts and have responded to several. There has been an influx of new people on this site over the past several months. I have felt lately, that there have been occasional posts that do not ring true. I realize that anyone can sign up and post questions to this group, however, I would hope that people using this site, are not falsely presenting themselves as breast cancer patients. Up until now, I have thought of this site as kind of a sacred place where I can come every day and read and share. I want to express thanks to all the woman who have helped me over the past 10 months. My prayers are with each of you every day. I want to ask everyone who uses this site to respect it and the woman who need the support that this site offers. Thanks for listening.",
