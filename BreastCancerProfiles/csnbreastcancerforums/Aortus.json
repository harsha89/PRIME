It now looks like Moopy's rads will be done on Wednesday. That's because the hyperthermia machine crapped out for three sessions last week, and Dr. Taylor is bound and determined that Moopy is going to get all the treatment she came up here for. Who are we to argue? Moopy also had her first meeting with the Physical Therapist, Dr. Ivens, who specializes in helping mastectomy patients with all the issues that occur. It went extremely well, and Moopy was quite impressed with her both as a person and as a doctor. As Moopy says, we sure have the A Team up here. She has another physical therapy session Thursday morning, which will give us time to round up the pooches and take them back home. If you ladies wouldn't mind, I would appreciate it if you would gang up on my beloved wife and belabor her into taking it easy this weekend. Moopsy always says she's going to relax and catch up on her rest, but somehow she really never does. She won't listen to me because I'm a guy and, more than that, her husband. But I hope she will listen to her fellow women. Thanks in advance! Joe",

My brother has never been a chemo patient, but he has suffered for years with a condition which is pretty much like you describe - hardly any sleep, and almost never any uninterrupted sleep. The doctors he's been to don't know what causes it or what to do about it, but at times it makes his life a hell. Doses of anti-depressants have helped, but he doesn't want to stay on them because \"he's not mentally ill\" (although everyone else in our family is). I really, really hope you find something that works and helps you attain the rest and recovery you so deserve. Joe",

She thought it was a kidney infection. When it got annoying enough, she decided we should go to Urgent Care and get on an antibiotic. Hah. The UC doctor, who was very kind and very serious, ruled out the kidney infection and started scanning away. Two scans and an X-ray later, Moopy had 1) a growth near her right lung, 2) a cyst on her pancreas, and 3) what looked like an obstruction in her bowels. Great! Moopy decided to make an appointment with her regular PCP, the awesome Dr. Hee-Sun Kim. Dr. Kim was already booked, but she switched patients with another doctor so she could see Moopy. She came in smiling as she announced her diagnosis: Moopy was full of poop! As Moopy's PCP, Dr. Kim knew that Moopy has had regular issues with \"regularity.\" Dull ache? Check. Feeling of fullness? Check. Moopy got a stern lecture on hydration and diet, and we were on our way. Resolving the concerns about the cysts took another couple of weeks and an endoscopic ultrasound, which neither of us even knew existed. We were supposed to consult with a pancreas specialist in St. Louis, but the EUS guy in Joplin said he could check it all out. Both were benign, and the Moopster (or should I say the Poopster) was good. The point is this, Pammy: what you are experiencing sounds like exactly what Moopy had going on last fall. It may well be a question of poopativity. Even if it is not, it is probably some other tweak or twinge. It is *not* cancer - that's what everyone was telling Moopy back then, and everyone was right. Now I am telling you the same thing. I look forward to hearing from you that I am right. God bless! Joe",

Once he woke up, Aortus took the pups for a walk while Moopy started some laundry. Then Moopy caught up on some correspondence (with pen and paper, no less) while the pooches snoozed. Meanwhile, Aortus changed some burned-out light bulbs and dusted the ceiling fans. As all of this was going on, they talked to each other about stuff like open houses and the glory of Swiffering. Later on, Moopy and Aortus will grab a little brunch and then do a little shoe shopping. Like it or not, Moopy needs new shoes, and Aortus is going to make her buy some. Not exactly the most exciting Saturday morning in the history of human existence. But it is a precious blessing from God nonetheless. Moopy and Aortus appreciate it as such.

Look at all of the unfair things that have happened to you in your life - the loss of your mom and then of your first husband, for example - and you just pull up your \"big girl panties\" and go forward. No complaining or sniveling - just your conviction that life is worth living and you, for one, are going to live it. I had you pegged the first time I ran into you on this board. You reminded me exactly of Moopy's big sister Jackie, who is exactly the same way as you: a kind, generous, fun person blessed with tremendous courage and a great joy of life. Sometimes Moopy's sister gets walked on because of her eagerness to be there for other people, but over the years Moopy has coached her in avoiding the emotional black holes of other people (read: her two whacko daughters-in-law). So there is hope for you too - since you're part of our family now, I'm sure Coach Moopy will give you the same family discount she gives her big sister! Love, Joe",

But my department head, who is not only a great administrator but is also a dear old friend, has shared with me her own feelings about her divorce nearly ten years ago. She helped me to realize that any dissolution of an intense, long-term, relationship is a sort of death in and of itself with its own sorrows and necessary grieving rituals. I wish both you and Hans all the best as you both move forward with your separate lives. BTW, my department head is now very happily married to a guy who is crazy about her (as she is about him, but he definitely chased her). Cue the obligatory \"the odds are good, even if the goods are usually odd\" speech... Best, Joe",

Neither of these facts are her fault or your fault. Please do not hate yourself! You are doing everything you can by consulting the doctor in Germany. I am not an expert, but I would offer a couple of options. One option would be getting your fiancee to Germany as soon as possible. No doubt it will be hard for her to travel, and hard to be away from Nigeria. But she will have you by her side and she will have better treatment in Germany than she would in Nigeria. In the meantime you might investigate which German hospitals would be the best. Another option would be traveling to the Johns Hopkins Breast Cancer Center in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. It is a world famous cancer center, and I believe (although I could be wrong) that they will see anyone who comes to their hospital. Their website is here: http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/contact_us/ In any event, I hope and pray that both your fiancee and you will get through this together and be well. Please come back with any more questions. God Bless, Joe",

But you have more than three - way more than three - reasons to keep up the fight. Ever since I left your doctor's waiting room and broke your news to Moopy, we have been talking about how bravely you have been handling the crap that life has given you. We know it comes with a big effort. Moopy even has a good idea of how big an effort it takes. But we also know the will to fight back hard - the will to really LIVE - is not something you have to conjure up. You have it, Linda. In spades. It's so obvious that even a guy can see it. A couple of weeks ago I was sitting in the oncology waiting room Moopy was having some blood drawn. I started talking to this retired couple. I assumed the guy was the patient - but when the nurse called HER in, he and I had quite a conversation. Lucy (that was her name, either that or something else) was five years out from her colon cancer and in her second year of being treated for liver mets. To see her laugh, and tell tall tales, and talk a mile a minute on her cell phone to everyone she knew, nobody would ever have guessed she has been on Tykerb and Xeloda for more than a year. I'm not trying to say that you should really be charging around the house yelling RAWR! at your daughters. But there definitely is a life after mets, and I know this because I met a woman who is having one. A wonderful life. Again, I realize it comes with a big effort. But you, Linda, are precisely the sort to make that effort. It comes to you naturally. Yours will not be an easy race to run - that much is clear. But the Moopster and I know what kind of person you are. And we're both betting on you to win. God Bless! Joe",

While we were driving home - it's a nice, sunny, fairly warm day - Moopy observed that getting out was a reminder of what our life will be like again. Actually, I had a really nice time as it was. I mentioned this thread to her - the common wisdom that the first is the worst because of the uncertainty and the rest is more of the same, only more so.
