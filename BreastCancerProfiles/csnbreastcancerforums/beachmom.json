    "Content": "So glad that you have received that good news! It seems you and I were diagnosied around the same time. I'm waiting for my oncotype tests (I asked that both tumors be tested) to be completed. Reconstruction has certainly been the slowdown in the recovery process! Finally had one drain out yesterday, hoping that this other one will come out tomorrow.... Have a wonderful Thanksgiving, we have so much to be thankful for. Keely",
