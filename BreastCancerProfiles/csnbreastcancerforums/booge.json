    "Content": "I elected a bilateral after finding a lump in my left breast. I had reconstruction done, however, the expanders are very very painful.I too was very small breasted. The expansions took us a lot longer to do than normal, but that was due to the pain. I am very glad I did both sides, even though I've had a lot of pain with the right side and that was the noncancer side. I just had my second surgery for my implants. I am very pleased how they look and feel and I am now a c cup. Never expected this. However, if I kept my right breast I would have had the other one lifted. My friend actually had one of hers reduced and is very pleased. Mammograms did not detect my lump due to my small size and I would think since you had cancer they will due ultrasounds on you..atleast that is what they should do to your healthy breast. Anyway..just another opinion for you. You are in my prayers and I hope you beat this other cancer. take care...booge",
