    "Content": "Hi Elizabeth. I am new to the chat room. I am stage IV breast cancer. I am still getting neupogen injections to keep up white blood cells after chemo. My family practice doctor prescribed a pain killer called \"ultracet\" for me. I discussed with my oncologist since she was prescribing vicodin and it makes me sick to my stomach. Ultracet works within 30 minutes or so and does not make me drowsy or \"out-of-it\" like most pain killers. My oncologist agreed to let me use it if it works for me. Also, some friends gave me these aromatherapy neck roll heating pad and eye-cover from Bath and Body Works. You heat up the neck roll in microwave and works just like a heating pad. I use it normally on my lower back as that is where I get affected by nuepogen first. Then I get the knee and calf pain. But I take ultracet and prop my legs up. Hope this helps. Julie",
