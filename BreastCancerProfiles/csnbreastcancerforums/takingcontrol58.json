    "Content": "I am from the uterine discussion board. After being diagnosed with Stage 3 endometrial cancer (and removing all my female parts (hysterectomy),two months later I moved to Stage IV metastatic, growing 34 NEW tumors (spleen, liver, rectum). Told I had four to six months to live. My integrative oncologist put me on metformin after two chemo infustions of taxol/carbo. After the 3rd infusion and one month on metformin, 88%of my tumors were gone. I had the remaining four infusions of Taxol/Carbo. Still had 2CM tumors left after the chemo. I said no more chemo. WIthin 6 mos of starting the metformin, I was in remission from a death sentence. Have had no chemo since then. That was last August 2015. I remain in remission to this day. Since the day I started metformin, I have had no recurrences. That seems to be what you most fear, as do we all.  Personally, since your tumors were so small and not life threatening, I would avoid chemo at all costs if it was me. Chemo is poison.  An acquaintance of mine had her tumors double in size after she got chemo for her TNBC. If you can try something else that is not toxic I would try it first. You can always get chemo. I don't know why people rush to get chemo when it doesn't stop cancer. I would definitely get a second opinion and find an oncologist who is a metformin supporter. Most won't. I think they want the revenue from the chemo.  I think it is good your doctor doesn't want to give you chemo right now.  Maybe you should ask him first about the metformin before getting a second opinion. Metformin kills cancer stem cells which cause cancer and escape the chemo.  If you can take a simple pill (it is normally prescribed for insulin reisistance-which I had-, diabetes and PCOS) and keep your cancer at bay versus taking poison, I would take the metformin and see if it works for you in preventing a recurrence.  And the drug is cheap. Metformin has also had good results with TNBC. Look up the many articles at http://www.pubmed.gov. It is the database of the national institutes of health. Good luck Takingcontrol58  ",
