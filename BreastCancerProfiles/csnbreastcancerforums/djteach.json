I'm like you, I'd have to email everything to Aortus to have him do it, or my niece when she finishes the school year. I've seen an ipod and I've seen people use them and that is the extent of my knowledge. As most of you can tell, I don't even know how to get rid of the edit signt after I post. I am the quees of the technolocially challenged. I think I need to add spelling to that list also. Love and hugs, Donna",

I had about a week of strange dreams but that went away. I am also able to adjust slowly back to my normal sleep times and patterns. I was a morning person for 48 years and I hope to be one again soon. At 52, I'm ready for something to go back to normal, even if it is just my sleep patterns. I wish you luck in your quest and hope you find a resolution soon. Not sleeping sucks! Gentle Hugs, Donna",

Their health is starting to fail and we are needing extra help around the house. Never once, has he asked, what can I do, do you need anything, etc. My father has stage V kidney disease and will start dialysis very soon. My mother's back is in horrible shape and she's been diagnosed with Lupus and Fibromyalgia and is having trouble with that. Yes, I can understand how you feel my fellow sister. Hopefully we can train them to look around at someone other than themselves and start showing as least some empathy. One can always have hope! Love and gentle hugs, Donna",

Sadness is normal and you can usually talk yourself out of it and it doesn't consume you. Depression, is a medical problem that can be treated with meds. and/or therapy. I know many, many, myself included, women that have chosen to have their depression treated with medication. Please call your dr., family, onc. whichever and check with them. Tell them that it is starting to interfere with all aspects of your life. You deserve to feel happy and safe again. This may help. Please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers.

Now we don't have to blame it on anything or explain it period. It's just the way we are. I always feel so much better after a good cry and it's one of the most intelligent ways to express feelings!

The silver lining is that no matter how aggressive the disease, there's a medicine that is just as aggressive. I don't know what kind of support you have at home, but you need to have someone go with you to all of your appts. Grab pen and paper and start writing down questions that you want to ask the drs. Having 2 people there helps you remember everything that was said and explained. It can be hard for us to focus when our brains are in overload. It will help you to have someone there as moral support. Don't forget to ask questions and have them explain in a way that makes sense to you. Remember that they work for you, not the other way around. Welcome sister warrior, we will all be here for you. Love and Gentle Hugs, Donna",

I can't complain though because it has kept a tumor in my lung from growing for 3 months. My outcome is worth the side effects for me. But remember, we all react differently to different medications.

I haven't posted my history yet, but I will when I get the energy. You appear to have a very supportive group and that is what I'm looking for. Thank you for reading this. Gentle Hugs, Donna",
