I just got home from a 3 month check up (surgery in Sept 2012) and all is well. I will keep coming on here for years to come, I hope. I think it's important to remember to pass on the support, so let's stay connected ladies!! Thanks again and have a wonderful year full of health and joy, Anna Â ",

We have to be very careful with our arms on the side of surgery to lymph nodes. I hope you see a doctor soon and find out what's going on. Good luck to you.",

As far as I know, it is used only in early stage breast cancer at the beginning to decide whether chemo/radiation is needed. So I don't think you have to do anything about it. I'm sure other ladies who have had it done can tell you more. I get the same marker test as you do plus they give me the one for ovarian cancer and the more general CEA one. Best, Anna",

Could you possibly take a break? My surgeon says that if I change my mind at any time, I can get surgery done and I don't rule it out at some point. Maybe your body needs some rest. You should certainly research the problem and find the very best care you can afford to avoid further troubles. In the meantime, try not to feel less of a woman. My prosthesis is so good, nobody can tell but my husband. I find I take more care with dress and make-up than before I was sick. That's what real femininity is all about. Being warm and joyous makes people want to be around you. Not many people care what your body looks like after all. Good luck to you, Anna",

Not only can vitamins (incl supplements) ruin your chemotherapy treatment, they can also actually feed your cancer and make it grow. So while I was doing treatment, I kept to a very bland diet making sure everything was clean and fresh to avoid food poisoning. After treatment, I was able to slowly go back to my very healthy fruit and vegetable based diet. I still do not take any supplements in pill form just in case. I would not eat apricot seeds if I had an active cancer in my body. It's important to avoid processed foods, sugar and too many animal products. This protects you from heart disease and diabetes as well. But everyone is different, so ask your oncologist what he recommends.",

I had a huge entwined double tumor and another two tumors in the lymph nodes so there was never any question I needed Herceptin. I credit it with saving my life (I'm at 4 years now) However, we have all heard of women with small tumors who ended up getting metastasis elsewhere in their bodies, so I would take the HER2 diagnosis very seriously. I hope I'm not scaring you, and it is very positive that you caught this early. Still, I think a second opinion is in order. If you do have to take Herceptin, you should know that it is very easy and nothing like traditional chemo. Best of luck to you!",

There is no way I could have paid this in a country with a minimum wage of 680 euros a month. I had to pay part of the surgery/radiation fees, but I can even go back for reconstruction on the state if I choose to.

The only annoying thing I remember was very fragile fingernails that would split. It helped to use a nail strengthener. The best thing was regaining my sense of taste again.
