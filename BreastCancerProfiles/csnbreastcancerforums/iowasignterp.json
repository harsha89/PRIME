      "Content": "Sending you lots of hugs, meena. You have been so supportive with so many other people. So what are you going to do with all of this time, well spend more time here on the boards with us, of course! Otherwise, have you thought about taking a cooking class through the local community and adult education centers?? It would be a great way to get out a night for yourself, meet some other people, and be somebody besides just a cancer survivor (heck, you don't even have to tell them if you don't want to). Or take up scrapbooking or journaling or make a cookbook to leave behind for your kids to inherit. (my kids would get the manuals to the oven and microwave, grin). Most people have good intentions about getting around to doing that stuff but never really do. definitely indulge your taste in good food and once you have got it all mastered, just set up an invite and we will all come over and eat at your house. I hope you have lots of seats at your table!! Speaking of which, go see the movie \"Eat, Pray, Love\" which I think would be perfect for you at this time. I haven't seen it yet but it sounds really good and everyone on these boards are wishing you to do just that: eat well, pray much, and feel very loved. take care!!",

      "Content": "i had a picc line but i won't do it again. I am writing this as i am recovering from a port surgery again (recurrance). the picc line was easy but it is like a constant iv sticking out of your arm. i had several strangers ask me what was wrong with my arm, i was already bald at the time, wearing wigs/scarves, and it was just another question that i did not want to deal with. if it is during winter so that it can be covered under long sleeves, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. the picc line also had to be covered while in the shower. it was a pain, plastic sleeves meant for arm casts or saran wrap and tape, uggh. check how often the picc line needs to be flushed out. the port needs to be flushed every month but i think the picc line is more frequent or it needs to be changed completely on a a regular interval. in the right hands, a port is much easier to maintain and much less noticeable. one downside is that not all nurses know how to use them. at the e.r., the flight nurses are the only ones who know how to use my port. i have had a lot of good luck with my surgeon. check with other doctors and nurses to find which surgeon they would recommend. especially check with nurses in the surgical area if you have it narrowed down to one or two. they won't always tend to volunteer recommendations but will usually volunteer good comments about a surgeon they would recommend. up to you, of course. a port is a one day recovery but i am not as concerned about my veins being busted. I am HER2 positive so i get lots of iv treatments. i know of a couple of people whose veins were ruined by chemo treatments.",
