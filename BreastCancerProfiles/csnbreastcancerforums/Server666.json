    "Content": "I have been on Tamoxifen for three and a half years and i am so over it!! I have gained 40+ pounds since i started. I have literally tried everything to lose weight and my scale hasnt budged. I also had a complete hysterectomy in Dec. 2015, which hasnt helped the situation. What are the risks of stopping the Tamoxifen or does anyone recommend a good otc diet pill, not that i want to take another pill but im at my wits end here! Â ",
