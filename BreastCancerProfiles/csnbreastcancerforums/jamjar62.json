      "Content": "Hi...I started on 4 cycles of Taxotere 3 weeks ago. I had my second cycle today. My nails got little blood blisters under them and were very sore and just plain looked weird/wrong. They have pulled away from the nailbed just a bit at the top. My oncologist suggested I try nail glue to hold them on. Has anyone tried this and did it work? All I can say is Thank God my ears and nose are permanently attached because chemo seems to go after anything that isn't! Karen",

      "Content": "I've picked out the songs for my funeral and married off my husband! I thinks its normal to go there at first....almost necessary in a way. Once you've considered the WORST possible future, then you can pull yourself up and say Okay, now I can face anything. The hard part is to not stay in that rut. I slip back into it once and awhile, feeling very sad for myself. Stay on your doctor's office. No reason you should have to wait 10 days for lab/xray results. That's ridiculous. I always call and ask the nurses to call the lab or imaging center to get a verbal report especially if a weekend is coming up. You'd think they would understand our panic and expedite these results. Whatever you hear, you remember you are strong and brave. You've gotten this far and you CAN do whatever you have to do. As my grandmother says though \"Don't claim it til you know it\". Blessings, Karen",

      "Content": "Hi...I also had reconstruction about 3 years ago. I don't have back pain but I have several places in my breast that continue to be sore. I know that a few of them are scar tissue because I have seen them on my mammogram films. I did not have a tram flap. I had.....can't think of the medical name....but it consisted of having abdominal tissue removed and then sewn into place via microsurgery. I had a doppler moniter in place to make sure the tissue took (that it continued to have a good pulse) and the place were the doppler was inserted is sore to this day if I put pressure on it. I finally decided to quit worrying about it because my scans and mammos are clean and I seemed to be the only one worried about it!",

      "Content": "I agree that a 4.4% increase doesn't sound like much on paper. But if you think of it in terms of 4 more women out of a hundred would live then it sounds significant...especially if you are one of the four! My radiation onc wanted me to radiate my neck nodes and I resisted because of the \"measly\" 7% increase in survival until I started thinking of 7 more women and I want to be one of those 7! We all want to hear survival rates of 100%; at least I do. But even life without cancer is no guarantee of living another day. Grab onto that 4% and go for it! You can always change your mind if the side effects are too much. Blessings, Karen",

      "Content": "Hey girls....finished radiation 2 years ago this past July. I had my neck nodes radiated at the suggestion of my radiation onc since I had positive nodes in the underarm. My dilemma is this: My throat seems more sensitive since then. Scented candles burning, Plug-Ins, perfumes all make my throat tickle and make me cough. Forget about it if I eat something cold! I'm coughing my head off! Has anyone else noticed this? I seem to remember my radiation onc saying something about this but I'm not sure. Thanks! Karen",

      "Content": "Hmmm..wonder how many docs that suggest exercising through chemo have actually ever been on chemo and tried to exercise??? I found that I tired very easily. One day I went out to pull weeds and I ended up so tired I could barely walk back up the driveway. I say you have to listen to your body. If it says rest, then rest. If it says exercise, then exercise but don't expect too much of yourself or get disappointed if you don't go as far as your used to be able to. I salute you for even trying! 1.75 miles is a good distance and I'll bet even Copper and Roxie were tired!",

      "Content": "Hi Tara...since your legs were achy before the tamoxifen, I'm betting its the residual effects of that darn taxotere. My hands, knees, legs and feet ache almost constantly and my second toe on my right foot is numb. It feels like I have a tight toe ring on it. When I get up in the morning, I feel like an old car that has to warm up before I can run properly. I haven't noticed that my aches are any worse on tamoxifen than they were before. Hope this is the case with you as well! Karen",
