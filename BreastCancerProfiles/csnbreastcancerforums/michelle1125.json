      "Content": "The strange thing is that my doctors and nurses all told me to avoid raw foods as much as possible during chemo. They told me to cook vegetables thoroughly and peel the skin off other vegetables and fruits and wash vigorously if I do eat them. But they stressed trying to eat only cooked foods. Something about viruses and the chemo weakening my immune system. Were you told this?",
