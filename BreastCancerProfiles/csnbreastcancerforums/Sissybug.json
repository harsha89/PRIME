    "Content": "Dear Pink I just completed one year and three months of Chemo and Radiation this past Friday,I experience pain 24/7 around the breast area and rib cage, my arm is still swollen and feels like a log sometimes.I feel the most pain during the night,I can't seem to get fixed in the bed just right to prevent this pain,any position I sleep in just doesn't work for me.
