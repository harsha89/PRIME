My cousin and her sister both chose to skip TAM after their surgery for very early BC and they are 10 and 20 year survivors - both got cancer around 40. S",

      "Content": "Congratualations- I'm living in the Minneapolis St. Paul area. I've have \"cobbled together\" soome onderful post treatment providers and in the process meeting other survivors. One of the groups I work with is a Group that has worked so hard to bring Gilda's Club to the Twin Cites. I see that there is a group in D.C. doing the same thing. Here's there webpage http://www.gildasclubgreaterwashington.org/ They look like they are still in the development stages as they are in Mpls/St. Paul, but I contacted the board of Directors when i was first diagnosed and offered to do whatever I could to help because we need the kind of support that they offer. Now I am one of the voices for survivors. The doors may not be open yet, but there are plenty of people working on helping those that are living with cancer (that includes your family and friend traveling this journey with you. I think ACS is another good place - they should have a listing for your area. Support in all its forms, hypnotism, physchologit, massage, excercise for br cancer survivors are helping me so much. The people i have with me not only heal but bring great laughter. My bigget joy. Hope this help - there are so many things that can be done that make living with cancer easier - Sometimes it takes a lot of research and traveling around the metro to find the groups and individuals that works for you. What I'm finding is that now that I have a \"team of post-treatment\" together the quality of my life is vastly improved. Hope this helps. She",

I referred to them as nodes the other day and freaked out my radiologist until he realized that I was talking about nodules. They have been watching them for 4 years. Each year I have a couple new ones, but they don't do anything. They never show up on the chest x-ray - just on the CT scan. She",

      "Content": "I don't buy it at all. I'm pretty expressive and don't tend to carry anger or resentment. I also have a genetic cancer syndrome in my family that is responsible for the colon cancer and that gene seems to have caused cancer in a lot of different personalities in my family. I do believe personality can affect how one handles having cancer and that in turn can affect life with cancer, but other than that I think its a waste of precious time for people to spend too much time with wondering if they \"caused\" their cancer. I think that once diagnosed with cancer, if one hasn't learned already, it's a good time to learn to play the cards you've been dealt, let go of the traits that Dr. Brodie describes and enjoy the life you have!

I wish I had an 88% chance of living - mine's about 20% with a 96% chance of recurrance. I'm hanging on tight to that 20% chance and doing everything that improves my chance for survival including excercise, diet, massage, friendships and hanging out with other survivors that are upbeat. I also hang on to the words of those who post on this board who have similiar diagnoses that are still signing on to this board 10 years later. Laughter no matter what the prognosis is still the best medicine and other than those situations over which I have no control, I only hang out with people that can laugh about cancer and talk openly and comfortably about life and death issues. Hope this helps -She",

      "Content": "I don't think that it's morbid at all. It's all a part of the journey. I think about this stuff all the time and usually end up laughing with friends. My dad and grandfather both died of cancer within a couple of months of dx, but that was long ago. It just about killed me but it was probably good for them. Enough time to talk but not a lot of suffering. My mom did everything the doctors suggested - too afraid to go. My sister fought until she met her goals and then said it was time to go - no more treatment. I think when the time comes I will follow suit. No hairshirts for me. I feel great and am very hopeful that I will be around for awhile and that's why none of this feels morbid to me. I'm also selective in choosing the people I talk to about it. Go figure, some people don't find it as amusing as I do. I started my obituary (with my cousins help) about six months after my diagnosis - It's a very fluid document and I only work on it when I or my cousin or friends remember a funny story. They've promised to publish it because no one in my family ever would = they are way too proper and my obituary isn't. I too want to be creamated and I want Meatloaf to sing \"I'm Still Alive\" and \"A Real Dead Ringer for Love\" for the men in my past. Doubt that will happen, but I'll try. Problem is I don't want a church funeral and don't want my sister to control the tone (she's really serious) so I'm still working on that and I have time - unless I get hit by a bus. My ashes are going down the Mississippi - a few with my parents and my sister and the rest to Ireland!! So, yeah - I think and plan and think that its a good thing. As my grandmother told me 36 years ago \"death is a part of life\", so I want mine to reflect me - whenever it happens. I doubt I could get anyone to wear the diamond, so I won't even try! She",
