    "Content": "Hi.....On Monday I am having a bioptsy to determine if my b/c has spread to my bones. Is it a painful procedure? And if the test is positive can there be treatment? My bone scan showed hot spots near my tailbone and towards my right buttocks......my MRI was good.......I even had an xray to be sure. I lost my right breast, 2cm and one node last March.......Thankyou for any advice or just plain experience. Carol",
