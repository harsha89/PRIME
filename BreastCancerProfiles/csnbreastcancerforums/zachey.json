    "Content": "I have been a breast cancer survivor for 1-1/2 years now. I had a lumpectomy, radiation, and was placed on tamoxofin. I am 58 years old, had a complete hysterectomy when I was 39, so the combination of being suddenly taken off estrogen, plus taking tamoxofin threw me into a hot-flash tailspin. I was given medication to help with those, and I can live with that part of it. Thbe part I couldn't figure out was about six months into the medication, I started feeling sad, mad, and any other emotion you can think of, plus I cried if you looked at me. When I went for my six-months checkup with the onco in Jan, he said it could be the tamoxofin, so we stopped it for two months to see if that was the problem. Apparently it was, because within three weeks I was back to my old self -- mostly happy, and able to handle whatever curves daily life threw my way without having a \"meltdown\" like my 3-year old grandson! I am now taking Arimidex, have been on it for five weeks, and the emotional rollercoaster seems to be starting up again! I was just wondering if anyone else has this problem with this medicine, or am I just going nuts! I feel so silly about all this -- I've never been in a \"chat room\" before, but I don't know who else to ask. Thank you. My name is jeanne.",
