      "Content": "Hi Mike - Thanks for the welcoming message. I have seen a lot of posts and started to reply and then realized I might be sounding like \"mine is worse than yours\", or my problems are worse. We all get tired and angry and negative at times, and being scared is one of the many emotions women (AND MEN) feel with this. A man I worked with also had breast cancer, many many years ago, and he is doing great. Hang in there friend, we are all in this together and you have our support as you start your own journey. You do not need to be forgiven, we understand. Pat",

It was raining hard when I got home and found my neighbor had brought my mail to me (our mailboxes are across the street from the house). So I was thankful to him for that, and then I saw the little red envelope. You and my ornament sister are my first cards this season. Thanks and Merry Christmas!!!! Hugs - Pat",

      "Content": "Today is my pity party day. Its the kind of day where I cry every hour or so. My sister who passed away had three children. (I never had children). 2 live in Virginia about 3 hours from me, and one in Philadelphia, about 2 hours away. All I've gotten from them are a few notes on Facebook saying, hope you feel better, glad the treatment's over. Oh well. Not a phone call, and not a visit during the holidays when they were up to visit their father. It hurts when they don't care enough. He was not there to raise them, I helped my sister raise them. Now he reaps their love and I get squats. I've told their father that I am very disappointed in them, they were NOT raised that way. I realize they are young and have their own lives, but come on! A flower or a card or a phone call would have been enough. It hurts. This also goes for my niece in NY and two in Florida, one being my own Godchild. Sorry about the poor me post, but a recent post made me realize just how selfish my own relatives are. Only one calls regularly from Florida, she and I are more like soul sisters. She is the only one who resembles me, and fights the same weight battle and love life problems I had at her age. But there is no excuse and my heart is broken because I've lost all respect for them. I gave them so much when they were kids. Oh well, we don't always reap what we sow! Its just been my Mother and I going through this. She is 88 and almost blind, so there wasn't much she could do for me. She'd get upset when I got out of bed to cook or help with laundry. She has no patience with me if I fall asleep in my recliner. Its been more me helping her than her helping me. She has never had patience for illness and this is no different. I honestly feel like I've been fighting this battle mostly on my own. I have a mobile home that is literally falling apart. One bathroom doesn't work and the flashing has come off the front corner and I've had birds and squirrels living up there. I have neighbors who are in the construction business and for 2 years they have been promising to fix it for me and never do. I cannot afford to get a professional in to do it, so it just gets worse. I guess when it collapses I'll move out. I just want to run away and hide, I know it sounds juvenile, but its what I want to do. I'm sorry - just needed to vent a bit. Pat",

I love this little poem and want to share it with you, and know that my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family, and especially for your lovely, loving wife.

I was going to go to work and go straight to the radiologist, but due to lack of sleep and a sick stomach from nerves the night before, I didn't make it to the office. I took my Mom with me (as she was with me last September with my first diagnosis) and found out that my long-term mammo doctor had dropped my insurance. They did the mammo and a sonogram for free, can you believe that? Anyway, (getting wordy here), they did the mammo, then a magnification of the new lump, and while I was waiting for the results the technician came out and asked me if I could wait while they called my primary care physician. She said he wanted to do the sonogram and needed an order from the PCP. So I waited and then had the sonnogram. Dr. B told me that the mammo showed a suspicious area which looked very similar to last year's in the other breast. The sonogram showed something different. It showed a lump with fluid in the center which could be a cyst or hematoma, but he did not like the peripherals or the sack containing the fluid. Lucky me! I have to have another biopsy and will find out on Tuesday when I see the surgeon when it will be. I really don't want to go through this again so soon, but if I have to, I have to. At least the fear of the unknown is not there this time, I know what I will go through. Funny how calm I feel today. Last night I wanted to stand outside and scream at the top of my lungs \"Bulls*&^\" but kept my cool. I feel like I'm in a fog. Here we go again! Just pray with me that it is not the beast and just a bump in the road. Love ya all! Pat",

Thanksgiving dinner had some flavor, but by Christmas everything tasted like cardboard. I tried to eat a couple of hot dogs on Christmas day, but they wouldn't go down. I lived on home made soups and jello the rest of the winter. Anything I didn't need to chew, which made it worse. The soups had veggies in them which I'd swallow whole, just to get the nourishment. My last chemo was the beginning of March and it took about a month or so for the taste buds to reappear and since then I have just been hungry. I lost 50 pounds (which I needed to lose anyway) but at this point, all I want to do is eat. I am always hungry and that's bad. LOL Enjoy what you can while you can because when the house smells of good comfort food durng the long winter months, and all you taste is cardboard, it gets hard. I remember over the holidays when my brother and his girlfriend were down from upstate NY, they went out and brought back Chinese. It smelled soooo good and all I could eat was the wonton soup. I wanted to cry, but at least I knew they were eating and I wasn't cooking! Let us know how it works out. Hugs - Pat",
