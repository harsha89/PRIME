    "Content": "Hi Karen, all your symptoms seem right. I had neck radiation 15 years ago. I have the same sensations you do plus decreased saliva.The worst is cold food, I have to drink everything at room temperature or hot stuff. I also have to drink alot of fluids when I eat or it gets stuck in my throat. Make sure your doctor follows up with thyroid stuidies. My thyroid was damaged due to the radiation (even though the shielded it.) About 2 years after completeling radiation I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I hope this helps. Karyn",
