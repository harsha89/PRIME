    "Content": "TODAY is my first \"every other Thursday\" that I am not having chemo (so it sounds like I am a week ahead of you) and I feel crappy too! Right up there with the worst days during treatment. I am trying not to let it frustrate me by reminding myself that I still have to suffer, at least, two weeks of the usually side effects that occurred during treatment. Starting tomorrow it will be new territory for my body. We do have to keep in mind that the doctors say the fatigue is cumulative, so it would make sense that we still feel like crap now. We also have to face the fact that it has been six months of trauma to our bodies (it has been 6 months for me between the surgeries and chemo). So, I figure it will take a lot of work over the next year to \"really\" feel good again - lots of rest, exercising as much as possible while trying to to overdo it, good nutrition, lots of loving family and friends and lots of humor! My body has been through more than I would ever have imagined. It is sh*tty. But, thank goodness chemo is over and we can start the healing process! My thoughts and prayers are with you and all the others out there going through this.....it is a long, long, long road to recovery, but we are going to do it! As my precious neighbor told me when I was first diagnosed, \"Chin Up, for now\"!",
