      "Content": "I am undergoing chemo (taxol) after bilateral masectomies in June and just found out my seven year old daughter has precocious puberty (early puberty). She is to undergo a mri to rule out a brain tumor soon. I am a single mom working full time. I feel like I have made so many mistakes! I brought her to the dr's last year for some small breast enlargement and she thought it was nothing. My new pediatrician refered us to an endocrinologist who did further tests. brain tumors are a rare cause though and they just want to rule it out. there is medicine that can help slow puberty down too. she may need shots every three weeks. please pray for us! When it rains it pours! God help us get through all this. I truely am exhausted!",
