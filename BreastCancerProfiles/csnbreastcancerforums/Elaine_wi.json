      "Content": "I received excellent support from a mentor from an organization called ABCD (after breast cancer diagnosos). Here's their website:Â https://www.abcdbreastcancersupport.org/ They will match your family member up with someone who has gone through a simlar situation. I got a second opinion and more imaging done from a different hospital system after my diagnosis. I liked the second team much better. They were more compassionate and more thorough. I did a lot of research on the internet about my cancer. I do not leave my healthcare decisions up to my doctors. I want to know exactly what is going on within my body. After educating myself, I felt confident proceeding with my treatment options. I needed a lot of emotional support along the way. I had a lot of ups and downs. Sometimes I just needed someone to listen without giving advice. Sometimes I just needed someone to hold me while I cried. I'm very glad you found this forum. Keep us posted. There a many people here who really understand. My prayers are with you and your family member. Just take one day at a time.",

      "Content": "I had a routine mammogram through the hospital that my primary care physician is associated with. I later switched all my cancer-related medical care to a cancer center that a relative recommended. I had another biopsy in the other breast and more imaging. When I got to the point of needing a surgeon I got more particular about who I chose. Remember you can always take the results of your biopsy to another team of medical professionals for a second, even third, opinion. I wish you the best Old Beauty!",

      "Content": "A biopsy is just a tiny sample taken with a needle. They numbed the area first so I didn't feel a thing. It is not visible to the eye. The radiologist uses either ultrasound or an MRI to guide him to the area. Really just a simple procedure. Don't worry.",
