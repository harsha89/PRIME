    "Content": "Hello Girly Girl! Positive attitude and keeping the faith. I finished chemo in September and the horror stories that I heard before starting chemo petrified me. Everyone handles chemo differently. After a couple of treatments you see a pattern. I will tell you that I never got sick from chemo and I never missed a day of work. The third day after chemo I was tired but I wasn\u2019t going to let it get me. It really is all about keeping a positive attitude and keeping the faith. Good luck! Keep us posted.",
