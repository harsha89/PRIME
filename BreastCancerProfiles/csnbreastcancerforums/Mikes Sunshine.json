      "Content": "Hi Friends, Today I had my Port put in. I am so tired so this will be very short. I am having my first infusion tomorrow at 10:00 am. I guess they know what they are doing but I can't imagine them trying to press around on my chest to locate the port and insert the needle. It is preety tender. Actually it hurts more in the neck area I think that it were they hook the port to the vien. I guess I will meet the red devil for the first time. I am going in with the attitude that the drugs are the warriors that will help me battle the beast. (Thanks Moopy) This has given me such a feeling of power. All the encouragenment I have received on this site has changed me from someone who was scared to death of the thought of getting chemo. Now I feel like bring it on baby!I will get back on as soon as I can with an update. Love,Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Moopy, I agree with Joe,go out and buy yourself some new shoes. I know how hard it can be to find just the right kind. I have very wide feet, I live in New Balance sneakers. Mine even have a little pink ribbon on the tongue. I bought them long before I was diagnosed kind of wierd huh. You can even buy them online if you choose. New Balance and Easy Spirit are the only brand I can slip right into and wear without weeks of trying to break them in. Good Luck. Love, Nancy",
