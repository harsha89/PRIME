I requested one when I thought I would be having chemo (even got the port implanted). Well, it may still be in the future, so I have it put away until... Hugs to you all. Gracie",

The members here will share all their best wisdom, advice, comfort and support. I had lump and lymph node removal in July. My discomfort was minimal, compared to what I've read that others have endured. Prior to the surgery I had lots of energy and ambition for making plans. However, I was exhausted for weeks afterward, I think in large part because of the anesthesia. I could not have traveled, even if I had wanted to. I wanted to stay in my own comfort zone, surrounded by familiar things, sleeping in my own bed. You should probably ask your doctors if traveling will be okay for you, especially if you are considering flying. I hope the surgery goes well for you. Please keep us informed of your progress. Hugs.

Tomorrow morning, I'll have another equal portion for breakfast. For my sisters in pink, who may have to use this liquid, the description says \"pleasantly flavored\", and actually, it's not too bad. Not nearly as chalky as I expected, and I can face tomorrow without the same aprehension as I was feeling before taking the first dose. So, cheer up ladies. The barium cocktail isn't awfully awful.

So even with ports that have some metal in the composition, a magnet is not likely to have a response to it. If stainless is used, it would have to be medical grade, which is probably unlikely to have magnetic qualities. I'd love to hear some opinions about this. Gracie",

As soon as I knew I'd be getting chemo, I scheduled an appointment with my dentist, for complete exam, cleaning and x-rays on my 7 natural teeth. That was today. The technician recommended a deep cleaning, and she managed to have time right then. Not pleasant, and my mouth is sore now from the needles, the scraping and all. But this was important to my peace of mind. There should be no surprises during my treatment. I'm also trying to get as much information as I can about possible side affects, what supplements I can & should take, as well as ones to avoid. Stocking up on \"comfort foods\", and also coaching HubbyDearest in the fine art of taking care of his most treasured possesion. I haven't much advice for you, as this is uncharted territory for me as well. But I have found this site to be a great source of information, support and comfort. Hope to see you again. Gracie",

      "Content": "This past Friday I went for my first Zometa infusion. I had to have \"training\" first, to learn about the possible side affects, and what I can do about them. (Zometa is a drug that is used to strengthen bones against the affects of Femara) It seemed to go very well, and I went out of there feeling very good. I'm thinking \"I must be one of the lucky ones...no side affects.\" Well! What I wasn't told in the training is that the side affects don't show up until the next day. Saturday I awoke feeling like I'd been beat up, then shoved in front of a bus. Every muscle, joint & bone ached. I had chills, fever, nausea & headache. All day, all that night, and all day Sunday. Today I have a lingering headache. I hate taking pain meds, so I'm toughing it out and drinking lots of water to flush out the toxins. Now, I was told that only about 10% of people on Zometa experience side affects this severe, and that is usually only for the first treatment. I'd like to hear from others who have taken Zometa, or are now taking it, for what I might reasonably expect to happen following each monthly treatment. God bless you all. Gracie",

      "Content": "Today I awoke feeling old, used up, worn out. Maybe it's all catching up to me, and I need to not think about it so much? How do you not think about the THING that has consumed your mind? Everything seems to revolve around IT, instead of anything else. Even when I'm doing other things, I think about IT. I don't like that IT has derailed my train of thought, and highjacked my life. Is this the 'new normal' I've been told to expect? Does everything have to be about IT now? I'm tired of the tests. Tird of repeating the same information to person after person. Tired of hearing the same canned responses from people who don't really understand. Tired of the well-meaning friends who now look at me with new, sympathetic eyes. And tired of telling myself how much worse it could be. I'm a very healthy person. At 67 I have no heart disease, no diabetes, no arthritis, no liver trouble, excellent lung function, no kidney trouble, I take no prescription meds at all...heck, I'm the poster child for senior vitalilty...except for IT. Do I have a right to rant like this, when except for the cancer, I'm a very healthy person? The cure for the cancer can actually take away all my other good health in the process. Maybe I'm scared, and the fear is making me tired?",
