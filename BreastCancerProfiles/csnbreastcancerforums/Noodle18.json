    "Content": "Hi! My sister had just been diagnosed w/ breast cancer and has decided upon a double mastectomy. She is currently undergoing all tests need so that her surgery can be scheduled. She lives half way across the country and being so far away from her I am wondering what my family and I can do to best support her and her family on her journey. My parents will fly out for the surgery, we've discussed having family members fly out to care for her and her family, etc. I need to know what would be best for her, what should we do, what should we not do. Thanks so much.",
