      "Content": "Blessings, I too have older children, 23 & 19, and often feel guilty about not doing things when they ask (they both live on their own). I worry about them if I die of cancer because they just lost their father last september to brain cancer, he was 43, I'm 39. Every day seems a struggle and I just keep putting one foot in front of the other. God bless, jhope",
