    "Content": "I went yesterday and had another ct and they marked me with red ink. I was shown the room to wait in and i have my very own cubby for the punk gown im to wear. I never cry and i think that it hit me yesterday that i have breast cancer. I hate ct scans!!! For some reason Im clausterphobic or paniky or something. My doc was there to run the machine and everyone was very nice, but I suddenly realized this is not the club I wish to join and am suddenly frightened. This place is pretty awsome. It offers free weekly massage and yoga and tai chi at no charge. A lending library etc.,but i never cry and did at least ten times yesrerday. Also have cording so three timees week to pt. There also great. Took me off tamoxifen yesterday for one week due to side effects. Just need a safe place to share my feelings. The marks i dont like at all.",
