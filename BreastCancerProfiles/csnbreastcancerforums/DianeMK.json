    "Content": "Dear All: It is with a saddened heart that I wanted to share with you the news that Heidi's journey here on earth ended last night. Heidi had mentioned to me that she was part of this great network. And, I can only imagine how much she appreciated having all of her angels there supporting her. She was a brave warrior during her journey and definitely gave it her all. Please continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers. God bless all of you always. Thank you. Heidi's cousin, Diane",
