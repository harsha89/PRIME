I recently worked on another blog post regarding new clinical trials that are trying to overcome cancer resistance to hormonal therapy http://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/forums/blogs/cancer-research/archive/2009/11/06/research-aiming-to-overcome-resistance-to-hormonal-therapy-in-breast-cancer.aspx Participating in these clinical trials won't be for everyone either, but this may be an appropriate option for some people. I don't know if these would pertain to you. John Facebook ID: John.Hayslip",
