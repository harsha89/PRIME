I started Femara in August 2008, and my body just wouldn't let me take this med, so I was changed to Tamoxifen in December 2008. Today, my hair is still thin, and I continue to lose more and more each week. The beautician said you lose 10-18 hairs a day normally, so a little loss is expected. However, I, like you,don't see any new growth. I just keep it short, and it seems to cover the bald spots better that way. Scalp massage will help to \"rejuvenate\" the hair folicles, so maybe you can try massaging your scalp at night while reading or watching TV. The more massaging, the more awakening, according to my hair beautician. I have also started using Tea Tree Oil once a week, and do see some improvement. Overall, I am just happy to be alive to deal with this hair issue. If I wind up bald, then the wig goes back on. At least I am breathing, and enjoying a \"hairless life\". I hope you get some answers next week on your test for folicles. Hugs, Judy",

      "Content": "One of the major assets I found as I was going through treatment was the assistance of a nutritionist. My cancer center has one on staff, and they were good enough to sit down and give me advice on what to eat, and when to eat, which, believe it or not, is very important. Even during chemo treatment, certain food types are helpful to give you more strength and energy. This was a big help for me, and I would suggest an inquiry at your oncologist's office to see if you can have access to this. I believe at my center that the nutritionist is available, but only if you ask for assistance. (Seems like it would be beneficial for everyone, but sometimes the system only works if you know how to use it.) Vitamins are a good source, but the \"real thing\" is better. Hugs to all. Judy",

Because of my size, (I am small across the chest area, and not much meat there either) it was a bit uncomfortable when I laid on my right side at night. As soon as chemo was over, I had it removed about two weeks later. It was removed under local anethesetic (again ?), and I was wide awake in the doctors office. Just didn't want to \"go under\" again. It was simple to come out, and didn't hurt at all. I would highly recommend a port to anyone undergoing chemo. Hope this helps. Hugs, Judy",

Noah was born early (only 35 weeks gestation), but weighed in at 5 lbs 1 oz. and is very healthy. Both Brittany and Noah went home yesterday (Friday) after being born on October 24th.

These are associated with Michael DeBakey, a world renowned surgeon. This is only a suggestion, but the website does have names of surgeons that you might contact to see where they have privileges. Dr. Debakey performed open heart surgery on my father many years ago, and we always trusted anyone he was associated with. Good luck with your search. Another possibility would be to call M.D. Anderson and St. Lukes to get a referral directly from them. The Medical Center in Houston is one of the best in the world, and I am sure you will find a suitable surgeon. Your own oncologist or PCP would be a starting place also.

It reminds me of my first marriage, which lasted 18 years, and how when it came to an end I literally exhaled for the first time is many years. Your relationship is yours to make decision on, and believe me when I say that if anyone can do what is right for themselves, it is you. Your strength has allowed you to not only fight bc and colorectal cancer, but care for Hans when he has had his own medical issues. This takes such a toll on a relationship, although we don't mind being there for the one we love. Time does make changes in how our relationships develop, and we become complacent to things that would normally be small issues. In my own case, I was drifting through life, raising three children, and drifting further and further away from what should have been my main priority.....maintaining a healthy relationship with the one person in my life that should have been there through all that life threw at us. In the end, I knew I had made the right decision when I called him at his office, told him it was time we seriously sat down and talked about divorce, and he was silent for about 30 seconds (while I am hearing rustling in the background.) He finally said, \"I think you are right....how about next Tuesday\". Well, you can imagine how comfortable that made me feel. We lived in the same house, ate at the same table, attended functions with the children for the next seven days, and he finally \"fit me into his schedule\" to discuss ending our marriage. What I am trying to say is, only you and Hans know what truly takes place behind closed doors. Your decision is one that only you can make, and given that you have really faced reality over the past few years, you need not deprive yourself of true happiness in your life. I am in your corner, and know you will do what is best for you. Who knows, the beginning of your next journey may bring you to an even better place than you have ever been.

      "Content": "One thing you might have your doctor check for is shingles. Depending on where the rash is located, some times this is a side effect of radiation. The immune system is compromised during chemo and radiation, and this is one of the more common problems that develop. I thought I had been bitten by a spider, as I broke out at my waist on my back. Because I couldn't see is very well by myself, I was relying on my husband to keep an eye on it. After about three days, I developed little blisters, and these turned into the shingles. A quick look by your doctor can tell what it may be, and if you catch it within 72 hours of breaking out, you can receive an innoculation that causes them to be much less harsh. Hopefully this is not what you are experiencing, but it never hurts to check it out. Good luck. Take care. Judy",

      "Content": "Hey Donna. Welcome to the best board on the net...one which includes all stages of cancer. This site is by far the best source of any kind of information you may seek, and lots of inspiration and hopefulness. If there is a question, someone on this board has been there, done that, and are perfectly willing to share their own personal experience. Like Moopy said, there is a site that has a thread specializing in Stage IV breast cancer patients, and it is helpful. This will primarily let you hear from ONLY Stage IV patients. The site is www.breastcancer.org. You might try there also, but please come back to this board when you need to talk, vent, scream, laugh, and be comforted by the real people who experience your pain. We are here for you. Hugs.

Although I was also out of pocket for a couple of weeks, and just returned home yesterday, I had you guys in my thoughts every day, as well as all of the other members of this board. I know you are glad to have the tx behind you, and definitely glad to be back in familiar surroundings. Isn't \"home\" a nice place to be? Moopy, continue your recuperation, and take good care of yourself. Don't rush out to mow the lawn, or anything more strenuous than making yourself a nice hot cup of tea and lifting a book to sooth your spirit. As far as the \"whirlwind\" trip to all of the 50 states, that will come in time.....and I am envious but smiling. After all, we all look forward to doing those things that we postponed before starting this journey. Now it is time to get at making plans to be a part of the rat-race again. Hugs to you both (and the dogs of course). Judy",

      "Content": "Hey Mimi...After returning from our two week vacation I have wondered why I couldn't find posts from you. Yours is always the first ones I read when I have missed a few days, and you were truly missed when I returned. The dulldrums are typical after completing all tx, especially the first two months following the end of rads. My onc told me that my body was trying to \"zap back\" to its normal potential, and the tx had put it into a state of not knowing what to do from day to day. Some checks in your blood levels could lead to an explanation of why you are down right now. Vitamin D3 was my culprit, and after getting on a regimine of a good D3 my body started responding. Maybe a call to your onc and a visit to have blood work done is something you need. Also, if you are taking any kind of meds, these will affect your moods. (I think they don't have you on an AI or Tamoxifen because you were ER negative). Any kind of sleeping aid, pain med, etc can cause depression, and can account for your mood. Enough rambling, but at least give these things some thought. We are all in your corner, and venting sometimes is just what you need to get back on track. Also, a good spa day wouldn't hurt. I am sending all my positive thoughts your way, as I am sure are many others. You are an inspiration, and deserve to be listened to whenever you have a need. Chin up, my girl....you are a winner, and things will get better. Hugs Judy",
