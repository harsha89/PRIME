    "Content": "Hi, I have been taking Arimidex since November 2009. I talked to my oncologist two weeks ago and she said the pain that I was experiencing was from the Arimidex. She gave 800 motrin because I do not want to take pain killers such as loratab. I have hurt so bad the last three days, I have considered stopping the treatment. I can't imagine 5 years of this pain. My hands are tingling and my ankles, feet, toes, wrist and thighs are in severe pain. My thighs hurt so bad to raise my legs last night. I could not sleep either. I will be seeing my oncologist for my herceptin on the 27th. I will be asking her to help me find another treatment. If you hear of some new information, I would like to hear it. Vanashell",
