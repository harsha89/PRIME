    "Content": "Hi everyone \u2013 It can be awful losing your hair everywhere \u2013 on your head, from your eyes, and yes, your eyebrows and eyelashes. I know it was personally devastating for me when I was sixteen and going through chemo. Remember, just because you are battling cancer doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t look and feel beautiful \u2013 I think doctors often forget this! Love, strength and survival, Britta",
