    "Content": "Dear Kelli-- I am new to this site. The past two years I have battled both breast and cervical cancer. I have had chemo and radiation with the radiation implants. I go for my mammogram the 10th of June and I am nervous also but my last one came out good and they advised me to have a mammagram every six months. My prayers are with you and stay strong. Keep looking up and keep the faith in your heart. love Sallyj",
