I once a week or so wrap the fingers and hand as shown how by lymph pt...and I also use the Kinsio Tex taping wrap on hand/fingers too. The tape stays on for a couple days/nights. But, no more sleeve at night which is nice. The arm feels achey at night...but does not swell...in fact it seems to drain. I do the pump first thing in a.m., then if I am home midday, and always an hour before I go to bed. Good luck with your pump........I am sure you are counting the days til it arrives. BTW, mine is set at 40/30/20 now.",

It is wonderful and has helped tremendously managing this since MLD alone did not....and wrapping 24/7 is not practical as you said. I still wear my sleeve durijng day and a glove. I run my pump at least 2x a day.......it is soothing, relaxing, and it works! Takes a bit of schedule planning in the mornings..... Good luck with your machine and the treatment!",
