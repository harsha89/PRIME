      "Content": "Tara,in response to your question....regardless of the information that we get,or don't get, there is just no substitute for talking to others who are going through the same ordeal when we go through treatment for cancer. Even if our doctors keep us well informed there are a myriad of small questions and fears that can be addressed by fellow sufferers rather than taking up the doctors' valuable time. Then there is the simple matter of comfort from others as we go through the trials of chemotherapy, surgery and recovery, at all times of the day and night. And there is nothing quite like someone who has lost their hair telling you that yours might come back curly, as theirs did!! Can there be ANY doubt about the value of cancer sufferers being able to keep in close touch, and support each other through their illness? Love Susan",

I was reading up on it, and it looks as if I am going to have it for the duration. So if anyone can give me some suggestions on how to prevent,and how to soothe i would be most grateful. worst is, it keeps waking me in the night, and the research indicated that this is the major problem. thanks for anticipated input. susan",

You and your husband are having a really rough time. I'm not the praying type, but know you are in my thoughts. Just take it one day at a time and you will get throught the chemo. Love Susan",
