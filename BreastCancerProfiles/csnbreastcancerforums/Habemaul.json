      "Content": "Hello Nancy, I just want to let you know my state of information: There are studies on clodronate by Diel (the one I have handy right how is \"Reduction in new metastases in Breast Cancer with adjuvant clodronate treatment\", The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol 339, but there is also a newer one, but I can't find the copy in my mess here right now)which seem to suggest that it is beneficial to add such substances to hormone therapie. At least there seem to be no serious advers effects, and it helps to keep the bones strong. There are also newer drugs of the same family which are more potent, but which have so fare not been studied to the same extend as clodronate. The other thing wich is disturbing me right now is the ongoing ATAC study (\"Anastrazol alone or in combination with tamoxifen ..\", The Lancet, Vol 359, June 22, 2002) which suggests that Arimidex is significantly better than Tamoxifen with respect to recidives and mets, but with some adverse effects to the bones. I will also try to figure out if I can do better than with Tamoxifen (which I had for one year now). Maybe you could let me know what your oncologist thinks? Good luck, Hugs, Ulli",
