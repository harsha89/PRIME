    "Content": "Traci, Sorry you are going through this.  I had two seperate mastectomies, hysterectomy, oopherectomy in a three month time when I was 47.  That was in 2001, so I am looking at this from a pretty different perspective. The oopherectomy was absolutely the worst!  I found little folding fans at the dollar store and carried them with me everywhere for at least a year.  I was put on different medications over the next few years that resulted in me gaining 70 pounds.  I still have those 70 pounds.  I hate it.  I wanted my \"old\" me back.  That weight gain has been, and continues to be, my biggest obsticle.  In hind sight, watch your weight.  Exercise daily!  Look Good, Feel Good!  I do not regret any of my decisions.  I feel better today than in 2001.  I totally agree with \"feeling like an old lady\" over night, but that passed rather quickly.  Pretty soon, you too, can get a laugh from all the commercials for hormone therapy! Hugs, Crystal",
