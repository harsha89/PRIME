    "Content": "So far so good, until now. I was diagnosed May06, did 10 cycles of chemo, had mastectomy, ovaries removed, radiation complete then began Herceptin. Took test for heart last week showed decrease in heart function. Now we have to determine if decrease is from Herceptin, maybe radiation. Will see doctor tomorrow and take ekg to get to bottom of it all. Not discouraged yet, but I have to be honest when I say that through it all I don't have the same horror stories that some of us have. Chemo didn't mess me up too bad, I think it killed some memory cells, made me a little sick in the morning only, as long as I took my meds I was fine the rest of the day. Had a couple mouth sore, but nothing to go to the doctor about. Herceptin and other meds have not had any adverse effests. I have been truely blessed. Now we face this. I'ts just crappy how the things that are meant to help you possibly cause other problems. Pray for me as I for you.",
