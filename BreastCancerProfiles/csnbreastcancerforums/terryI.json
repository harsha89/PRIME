    "Content": "I finished my chemo jan 5, 2004 and started going without my wigs and hats sometime in march. The reaction I received is the same as everyone else. People thought it was just a very short haircut and my hair was very curly (never had curly hair before) and to tell you the truth I really liked it. My hair is back to being straight again and sometimes I miss the curl. Wish you well, be brave and don't worry about what other people think. love, terryi",
