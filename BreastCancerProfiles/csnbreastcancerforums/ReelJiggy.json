      "Content": "Mary- First of all, you have to have faith in your doc, if you don't, you need a new one. Make him sit down and explain everything and don't let him go until you UNDERSTAND everything. Nobody will care more about your care and prognosis more than you and the ones who love you, you are in charge of saving you life! Did you have an OncoType DX test done? This is a test of the breast tissue, it can tell with relative certainty what the chances of cancer recurrance is. I would imagine your age has everything to do with the agressive treatment. Go for it, all in! NO REGRETS! It won't be easy, but nothing worth living for is! Take your daughter out to help you find a nice wig, and be picky, there are some really nice ones out there, worth the extra money, your insurance may even pay for it. Do this before your second treatment, because you will need it. I was very upset about losing my hair, I got over it, you will too. Get your church, your kids school, neighbors involved. I had meals coming for 4 days after each chemo, now is not the time to be shy. I was the one who helped everyone and anyone who needed it, volunteered up the wa-zoo. I promised myself that I would accept EVERY offer for help! You are up for the fight of your life, the prize is worth it! You can and will win this one. I have a good friend who is a cancer consultant, I couldn't have done it without him. If you are interested in talking with him I could message you his phone number via email or FB. I will try and get web site info and post. NO REGRETS, NO REGRETS, NO REGRETS! There are no Do-over's in this game. Good luck and keep us posted.",

I am sure your husband will want to go with you at least your first time. Mine wanted to go everytime, but I found he was keeping me up!",
