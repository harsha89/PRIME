    "Content": "It will be three years next month since I had a Lumpectomy on my right breast. For the last year I have been suffering with a severe pain in the rib cage area, that is like an extreme muscle cramp. I need to know if anyone else has experience this? Reaching, bending, coughing etc. can bring it on, I even went to Urgent care once to be told, well your cancer may be back, but I saw nothing in an x-ray. The problem being I have no health insurance, he thought I needed a scan. Any feedback with be helpful. Thank You, M.",
