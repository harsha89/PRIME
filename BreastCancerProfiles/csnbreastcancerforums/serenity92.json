      "Content": "My oncology appointment is three hours from now. I gotta say I am really nervous. I have been off of any breast cancer meds for about six weeks now. I couldnt metabolize the tamoxofin, so had the ovaries out and started arimidex. Unfortunetly after just six weeks on it I was forced to stop because the side effects with my leukemia chemo were so severe. When I called a few weeks after stopping the arimidex and told them I was scared not to be on anything his nurse told me they had to consider \"quality of life\". So today we hopefully set the next plan in order. Its exhausting with the leukemia, all the surgeries for the breast cancer and reconstruction, the emotional toll, being a single mom, trying to keep working full time...etc... Please send me a little good juju that there is something else that we can try and that due to quality of life...I wait for the mets to pop up somewhere. Ugh I wish it was already bedtime...lol.

      "Content": "Hi my name is Jayne. Six years ago I was diagnosed with leukemia (cml). I have been in treatment ever since. I am on my fourth kind of a targeted chemo treatment. Three weeks ago during my regular oncologist appt. I mentioned a change in my breast I had noticed. Because of my pre existing cancer he immediately sent me to Piper for a mammogram. Well three hospitals, four mammograms, two ultrasounds, a breast MRI and a MRI guided breast biopsy later and my oncologist calls me on thursay to say my 'messy breasts' do indeed have cancer. I didn't hear much after that.... I was standing at the service counter of my job when he called. Now I see a surgeon on Thursday and my head is swimming. I am a single mom and the sole support of my family. I do not have a caregiver and I work full time, plus. I am already so exhausted every day I just have no idea how I am going to handle this new challange. Overwhelmed, exhausted, scared and just needing to vent.... I dont want to scare my little girl.

      "Content": "Hey there, my name is Jayne and if you look at my screen name it is Serenity92...thats when I got clean and sober. Getting sober with cancer is the same as without it. You have already taken the first step by recognizing you have a problem and reaching out for help. The other replies had some good advice. I found myself a community of sober people like the one mentioned in a previous reply who were there for me so that I did not have to take that next drink when I wanted it. I live by some very simple rules...One day at a time...keep it simple...Dont let your head hit the pillow at night without thinking about three things you are grateful for and do the same thing before your feet hit the floor in the morning. Sometimes the things I have been grateful for were as simple as a good parking place at the grocery store and sometimes they were bigger like my leukemia labs are measuring good and so I dont have to have a bone marrow biopsy done for awhile. Dont stop with this post...reach out. People are seldom successful when they try to battle addiction alone. While we may be able to stop using we still need to deal with the issues that make us want to use. Best Wishes..",
