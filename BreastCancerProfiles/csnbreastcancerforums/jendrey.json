      "Content": "This dr. most certainly could've handled the situation better. Like, what part of 'on call' doesn't he get?!! My wonderful plastic surgeon explained to me a little about this... she was concerned after one of my surgeries and told me if there was a problem that I should go to the ER. And that the ER would call her first thing but that the ER may not alert me to this fact. But that calling her would be the top-most thing they'd do. I did doubt the ER would actually call her but I didn't have any doubts that she believed they would call her. If that makes any sense. I, too, think that the dr. should've restricted his number especially as it's a given if you call anyone from your cell that they then have your number. It might've been his umpteenth on call patient but it was YOUR first and a little bit of empathy from his side would've gone a long way.",

My usual response is hey, with a little chemotherapy you too, could have the very same hairstyle. But this clerk knows about my breast cancer and we conversed a bit more..I left in a good mood. For most people I tell this to, it is a great 'shut-me-up'!!! A lot of the time they are just speechless. And you know what? I couldn't care any less. =)",

I'm gonna wait till the middle of the night when it's way cool outside and give it another try then. I'm working on that 'heat expands, cold contracts' type of theory with this idea.

      "Content": "Minka - sorry you have cause to be here but glad you found us. I don't know why doctors really don't go over the gritty details; it sure would go a heckuva long way towards soothing the unknown! Yep, it sure does seem like things are happening at lightening speed and afterwards it may seem like everything has suddenly gone into slow mode. (waiting for your drains to come out) I had a ultrasound guided biopsy, breast conserving lumpectomy along with a 'sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure', chemotherapy, and finally a mastectomy with delayed-immediate reconstruction. Also about 8 weeks of radiation therapy. I have never felt any pain from any of these things; not even the fractured rib! (from I don't know what...but suspect the radiation treatment! =) Your 'mileage' may vary. ;D Ask your doctors anything and everything and as many times as it takes for you to understand the answers. It's sometimes difficult to remember what it was you wanted to ask when you're in front of the doctor, myself I take a 5x8 notebook everywhere with me and write questions as they come to me and also especially when in the waiting room. Sometimes, a doctor will see that I've got a laundry list of questions and ask if they can just read my notes and then systematically go through and answer everything! I suppose what surprised me most about surgery was the numbness of my arm. It took months for the numbness to go away. But it did go away and now I have complete feeling back just as before. Are you going to have reconstruction? Please try to see a plastic surgeon to explore ALL of your options BEFORE your mastectomy. It gave me great peace of mind that tissue expanders were placed at the same time of the mastectomy. It wasn't sure that I'd be having radiation and I think that's why they went ahead with the delayed-immediate reconstruction. I have two other friends that their doctors each are reluctant to consider doing reconstruction due to the radiation therapy. Consequently they may not have reconstruction (not with their current doctors anyway) even though they want to. I'm just sayin'.. It's not at all selfish to want your family near you when you need them most. Take the plunge and ask them if they (or maybe just one of them?) could possibly come out for a few days. A little moral support would be such a great relief! Tell them you need someone to drive you home from the hospital and you'd rather it be them?!! Are your grandkids teenagers (maybe young adults?), ask if they'd consider if one of them might give you a hand after surgery by keeping you company so that you won't be all alone in this. Last but not least and this is the most important...ask your doctor BEFORE anything else what number your should call to reach him or her should you have a need to do so. They may tell you to just go to the ER if you have any complications and that the ER will then contact them. Which, IS true but for your own sense of security and for that not-quite-emergency-status situation you'd STILL like a number in which to reach someone for whatever. Better to have a number to call for answers and not need to than suddenly find otherwise. I'm just sayin' Please keep us updated we will all be wanting to know how your surgery went and how you're doing. =) You are not alone in this journey for we are all right here beside you. We are your sisters in pink! Come here anytime and for any reason. We so get it here. sorry if double post exp. issues today!!",

Personally, I think it is all of the stuff in our surrounding environment and that some people just have a genetic predisposition and/or are more susceptible than others. Regardless of whether or not a carrier for the BRCA gene. I hope that in some way you can come to terms with this beast and are able to move past the why me part. Myself, I haven't experienced this particular aspect and I really don't know why not; as it's perfectly understandable to question why me... However, I do know how it feels to be stuck, so to speak, in an seemingly never ending emotional void with no apparent end in sight. It sucks. It really and truly sucks. What helped me --and may or may not help you--¹ is that I sat down one day and just ran through every conceivable scenario of the worst outcome I could ever imagine. I thoroughly explored each and every situation and how I might respond. Then taking it a step further I tried to imagine how everyone around me might act or react. I guess once I was able to see the worst I was no longer afraid, no longer questioning why/what/how...it just was; with no real answer or reason. I will never know the answer and whether or not I did the right thing. I did what I could do, and it wasn't even the best that I could do at that. But, you know what? It doesn't matter. I'm ok, and that's what matters. You're ok too, and that's what matters. Maybe a little worse for the wear, but aren't we all?!! =) (((Hugs))) ¹Your mileage may vary!",
