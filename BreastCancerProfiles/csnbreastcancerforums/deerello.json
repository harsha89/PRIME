      "Content": "Yes, I notice them too. They are everywhere! Even the ladies that work in my plastic surgeons office have had theirs done. (Is that a perk or a prerequisite of the job?)I had a bilateral in 2/2012. My hair and my breasts were two of my best features, and they are both gone! My hair will grow back..... Anyway, I am looking at a long road of surgeries in the future but I plan on beating this cancer and getting back to some semblance of life as I knew it, and that includes breasts. My plastic surgeon does not talk about size because that is a ways down the road, but finally he told me he would make them as big as he could. I would like to at least have the size God gave me, although I can't imagine what they will feel like. It was my choice to have mine both removed as the chances were good the cancer would return. At least they will match, but I still miss the old ones. Amazing what you wake up every morning and take for granted!",

      "Content": "I haven't posted in a while. But to recap, I had immediate reconsruction after my bilaral. Neither implant wanted to stay. My body, I guess, had had enough abuse and it did not tolerate intruders. The first one came out in May. I was still on chemo, and the hole still has not closed. 2nd one in July, skin is messed up. I am doing radiation on the axillary but the doctor wont start the chest wall until the site heals and I want to say \"Dude it is not gonna heal\" so that puts radiation off until doomsday or thereabouts. And, of course, my PS cant do anything until after. So my life is in limbo. I am walking around with two oozing holes where my breasts used to be, and I understand it takes what it takes, but the longer I am away from my life-financially, mentally, I don't know if I will be able to come back with it. And I also know that there are a lot of pink sisters out there worse off. I am still trying to understand what message God is trying to give me, but he remains elusive. I look in the mirror and I don't even recognize myself. I am so done with it. I am just so pissed. And SAD",
