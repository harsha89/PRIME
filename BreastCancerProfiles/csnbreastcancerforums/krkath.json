      "Content": "Hi Kath, Glad your back and safe. I'm so sorry to hear about your sister. I can relate. The very first day I started chemo, I got a call from my neice saying the paramedics took my sister to the hospital. She died while I was hooked up to IV's! I went directly to the hospital after chemo and she was brain dead, so we had to make the awful decision to \"pull the plug\". (They said accidental overdose, but she also like your sister was on a lot of meds for Bi-Polar Disorder) But you're right, they are our Angels in heaven. I know she's still with me because sometimes I get these wierd feelings and she comes to mind or seems like she's trying to tell me something. I dearly miss her. Hope you and your family here are doing well. And Happy New Year to you and hoping things WILL get better. Prayers to your sister. Kathy R.",
