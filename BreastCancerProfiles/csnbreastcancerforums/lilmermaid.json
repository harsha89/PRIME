    "Content": "Hi everyone it's lilmermaid (Sylvia). I am from upstate New York and I just returned from vacationing in south Florida for 15 days. It was 15 days of heaven. The weather was perfect except a few days of rain. I was in the pool almost every day. My sister has a condo down there and when you walk out her back door you walk into a beautiful court yard with flowering trees and beautiful palm trees and a beautiful pool. If you walk out her Front door and go across the street there is the ocean. It's my favorite place in the world to be. I feel I have a new lease on life and I feel I can come back and face chemo again. Tuesday Nov. 20 is my chemo day, I will be two weeks late getting my chemo so I have a little bit more energy. It feels great. I will be going back to Florida around the end of March and I'm looking forward to it very much. I guess we all need a break. It does us a world of good. Love and prayers to everyone. Sylvia",
