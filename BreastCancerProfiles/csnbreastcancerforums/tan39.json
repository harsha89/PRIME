      "Content": "Hi Everyone Now i am well known for doing 50 things at a time and running before i can walk!!, i am 4 weeks after my last chemo (no rads needed), have taken up Yoga and am back to work, trying to keep active as much as possible, but am finding my body doesnt want to do what my brain does, popping plenty of Nurafen Plus to keep my aching body going and my right side where i had mastectomy aches quite frequently. My question is, when does your body feel as keen to get on with life as your brain does?? Am i overdoing it (as my husband likes to tell me) or should i be doing more to strenghthen everything up .. Your opinions would be greatly appreciated.Tan xx",

      "Content": "hi kit, i had right breast mastectomy in February, lymph nodes removed. My stay in hospital was only 2 days but some of the other women in my ward had to stay a bit longer because of swelling and their drains were not emptying enough fluid, i think it depends on the individual person and how quickly they recover, but good luck to you Kit.",
