You are a strong woman who has survived a lot. This too shall pass. Having lost a child I can honestly say that. It may not be soon, but you will heal. Love and blessings, toni",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Well the first Chemo really easy. I went in at 11:00 and left at 2:30. This is day 2 Saturday, and I have had no nausea, no tiredness. I feel just fine, except for a weight gain from the steroid, and some blurred vision for a bit today. I have a question for all of you today. I go again in 3 weeks, and I am wondering if this one was this easy, do the rest get a bit harder or do they get a bit harder??? And for all the suggestions I thank all of you, and I am drinking drinking and drinking. Mostly flavored water and green iced tea. Thanks again friends. Toni",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Just a brief note for all of you. Don't know if you have a Gilda Radner Club in your area or not, but I strongly recommend it. I joined the club here in Pittsburgh last week. It is a completely free organization and is first class. You meet and have time with Cancer survivors, and fighters for activities, lectures, support, classes in meditation and other activities that are too numerous to mention. They even had a Bongo drum club. They supply the bongos! I met so many new friends, all with different forms of Cancer and different outcomes. It really is a great place. I am so fortunate to have found one here in Pittsburgh. There are only 51 in the U.S. If you have one go visit. My hubby is having a reverse of his colostomy in June, please keep him in your prayers. I on the other hand start some retesting. Mammo's, Paps etc. I kind of feel a bit scared, but I have faith and I trust nothing will happen that is not supposed to be. Hope everyone is enjoying Spring, and for those who have had not so good news, BLESSINGS TO ALL OF YOU, YOU ARE IN MY PRAYERS. Toni",

      "Content": "I don't feel angry, but I got upset when the morning show gals were made out to be such heroes in their fight with breast cancer. First of all I did not see them lose their hair from chemo, and although I tried to keep myself high in spirit, their attitude seemed just a bit too high. I don't think they give false hope, but I believe they make gals who are not surviving this beast very well feel low. I wonder who their doctors were? I too have my faith, and I believe that God will help me thru anything, even if it is facing my death, which we will all do someday. I watched him help my son face it with such courage that I cannot possibly doubt his care for us. He did not want me to have cancer, but we live in a world that we created with carciogens, and pollutants, and so many other poisons, that we humans had a hand in. He gave us all free will, and sometimes we don't do a very good job with it. I am a positive person and I will live what time I have as a survivor. I have had to make some decisions about after treatment. I have stopped the Femara, and I am refusing Tamoxifen. The side effects were not pleasant, and I don't want to live feeling horrid. My decision again, not God's will, but my FREE WILL. It would be great if some magazine took notice of the posts on this site and gave a true picture of the struggle we all face. It might lead a lot of other cancer newbies to this site and the support all of us can give them. Honest answers, and a feeling of I am not alone. I don't think the stories are false hope, but surely they are not about the majority. Blessings to all, Toni",
