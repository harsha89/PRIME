      "Content": "Hi All, Well, it's been almost a week since my nips were constructed and I'm doing great. Had to recreate the \"monopoly hotel\" cover (thing protecting the nip on all sides all the way to the top) on my own by sterilizing a sponge and cutting a hole in it but other than that it's all good. Like a lot of you I had a major reaction to the tape and switched it out for paper tape which was 1000 times better! Heavy bruising on the tops of both but the pain is minimal. I change out the gauze and put neosporin on them daily. I have to be careful not to \"smush\" them or they could collapse so sleeping is a little less delightful lately. I'm told this will be the deal for the next 6-8 weeks. Still a lot less harder than what I've been through already! Love to All! xxoo, SamuraiMom",

      "Content": "Hi All, It's been a while. I've been on the job market online at night so as you can imagine that sucks the life right out of ya after a long day's work at my existing hell hole. ;) (any yes I'm glad to have any hell hole paying me at the moment but I've got to find a new hell hole! ;) This could take years in this wonderful economy!) OK enough boo hoo job stuff. Hmm. How do I describe this...Righty is all healed but I'm feeling like she's a tad too \"tall\" and not shirinking enough. She's the size of an eraser if you pulled it out of a new pencil. Hmmm. Hoping she'll shrink to more of a \"mid-semester\" already whittled down eraser size. Lefty, well Lefty is just the right size but still not healing. Every day I change the gauze there's still a little crusty stuff that comes off. (sorry to be gross) They were done in June (I think) and I've never had anything take THIS long to heal. Implants were put in March and I still have pain when I overdo it. i.e. carrying in heavy groceries, etc. My tatooing is set for September 11th. I'm hoping my ps's confidence is right so that by then they'll look exactly as they should. Ah the impatience of what we endure!!! Love you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! xxoo, SamuraiMom p.s.On a positive, exciting note... I made it to the voting portion of the Pepsi Refresh Project online to maybe win a grant for my website!! I need to be in the top ten by August 31st to win the grant!vote for me if you like at: www.refresheverything.com/mymastectomyonline If we can't find the cure just yet we CAN help keep getting the word out!",

Anyway, I kept seeing this strange large \"thing\" that resembled a large vein moving aroud the top of my boob. I thought I'd better tell the plastic surgeon before he cut. Turns out it was just the \"rippling\" of the silicone implant. I'd never noticed anything like this until recently. I think it may be because my pectoral muscles are finally starting loosen up and you can see more of the implant. Just wanted to share in this new development. Maybe I'll only gain five pounds this week! ;) xxoo, SamuraiMom",
