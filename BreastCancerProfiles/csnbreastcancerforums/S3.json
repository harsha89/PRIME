    "Content": "I have to wait 4 weeks from chemo for surgery, or until my blood work is okay for surgery. In regards to surgeon v/s oncologists is concerned, mine disagree and I feel it is their job to explain both sides, than I decide. I have no tumor, cancer showed up as a lump in my nodes in armpit and spread to the muscle under the breast by the side. Onc wants me to have a mastectomy with axillary clearnce. Top breast surgeon in the area recomends node dissection only because there is no tumor and radaition will take care of what little cancer is in the breast. I decide on just the nodes.",
