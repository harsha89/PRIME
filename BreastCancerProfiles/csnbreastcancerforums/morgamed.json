      "Content": "Take the words out of Donald Trumps mouth and say \"You're Fired\"!  I had similar experience with an oncologist, oncologist surgeon and a hospital.  They all got fired due to poor service and I wasn\u2019t putting up with it.  I finally found a great surgeon and things worked out much better.  You are paying them.  You should demand and get the respect you deserve.  It\u2019s all a numbers game to them and they like the good paying insurance companies over the less ideal companies.   I started taking with me blank invoices with my name, home number and address pre printed on them.  If I had to wait more than 15 minutes for the Dr then I started my own billing system against them.  I charged $200 a hour.  That was $50 dollars for every fifteen minutes they made me wait for them from my appointment time.  Once I had to wait for an hour and a half for my oncologist and I handed him a bill once I got to see him for 250.00 and he was speechless.  Needless to say that visit was FREE never charged on my insurance and I got several apologies and a hand written thank you note for bringing this matter to their attention.   You have to do what is in your heart.  If you are upset with their service if you can go find someone that will work for you.  Not you work around them. We should not be back seat drivers in our cancer care we should be behind the wheel honking the horn all the way!  I will keep you in my thoughts.",
