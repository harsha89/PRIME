    "Content": "My surgeon, herself, just called and was so happy to tell me that she wanted to give me the good news herself. There was absolutely not one lymph node that was infected on the final pathology report. Also, the tumor was actuallly smaller than what she first measured (which would have made sense since she measured it from the outside). I will see her Monday to get checked and hopefully some of these annoying drains out, as well as a plan of action. There aren't doctors these days that will actually call themselves and news, good or bad. I'm so happy!!!! Maryann",
