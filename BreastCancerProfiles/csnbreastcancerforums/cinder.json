I am now on Arimidex, I didn't hesitate when they told me it was back I said what do we do next? I didn't have enough problems with any of things that I had to go thru not to try again, who knows maybe I'll get another 10 years. Best of Luck in whatever you decide. Prayers, Cindy",

      "Content": "My breast cancer is back in the same breast after a lumpectomy in 1993. I now have fluid going into the pluerel cavity and it has collapsed the lung once. The first time they drained off 3 liters of fluid. The second time it filled they went in and put a chest tube in for 6 days. Before they removed the chest tube they put some kind of sealent into the tube to seal it so it could not fill up again. I just found out yesterday it did not seal and I will have to go every so often and have it needle drained for the rest of my life. It has been 21 days since they removed the chest tube and I can feel my lung filling up again and I know it's about time to have it drained again. Has anyone else ever had this happen to them and had to go through this? Is there any other way to go other than having it drained about once a month? They have not mentioned a mastecomy to me but I'm beginning to wonder if that would take care of it seeing as how they say the fluid is coming from the breast? Thanks for any help or just listening.
