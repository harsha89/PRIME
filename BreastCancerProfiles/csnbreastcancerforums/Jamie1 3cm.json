    "Content": "I had my breast MRI on Wednesday. I watched a YouTube video ahead of time, so I knew exactly what to expect. And I had the added bonus of the radio headphones. But I was HOT, and u fortunately, I am extremely heat sensitive. I faint, throw up, or have diarrhea, not necessarily in that order! I did keep telling the tech that I was really hot, and she turned on the fans that I think are part of the machine to try to keep you cooler. But it wasnt enough for me. By the time we finished, I knew the minute I got off the machine and sat in the chair right beside the machine, that I was going to faint. But before I could say anything, the nurse looked at my face and just said, \"uh oh.\" They started packing me in ice. It took just a few minutes of that to make me feel much better. when I was back to rights, the nurse said my entire head had turned the brightest shade of red she had ever seen. Indeed, I had a an angry red rash on my chest the rest of the day. But all that ice really helped. So I was wondering, why can't they put ice on the backs of your knees or something like that to keep us from getting that hot in the first place?",
