    "Content": "Hello everyone...my sister in law is going to be starting treatment for breat cancer soon and i was talking to her about when she gets her port put in.  She was telling me that she has decided to not get a port or picc line in becaue she finds it inconvenient that it has to get cleaned by nurses at your home or has a high risk of infection.  This is all true but isnt it alot easier to do treatment with one put in.  also its very convenient if other tests have to be done also right?  any idormation would be greatly appreciated so i can pass on to her the pros and cons.  god bless you all!! pem",
