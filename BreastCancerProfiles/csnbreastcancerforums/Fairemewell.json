      "Content": "Hey all, I had my last weekly Taxol Monday. Although I am glad to be done with that, at least for now, admittedly I am nervous about the bilateral mastectomy in about 3 weeks. Depending on how that goes and what they actually find in my breast post removal I may be finishing the last three weeks of Taxol and/or having some radiation. Anyway, my surgeon thinks it will all go well. Hopefully I will be able to get some sleep. Darn steroids have been doing this to me every week! Can't say I will miss these side effects. Good thoughts and wishes to anyone who stumbles by here. I hope you are having a good day. Thank you, Tyler",
