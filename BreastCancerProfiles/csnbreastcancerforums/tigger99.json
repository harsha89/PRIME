    "Content": "My nipple was created 3 weeks ago. The skin was taken from the breast area, to left and right of the nipple. He didn't refer to it as \"purse string\" but rather he described it as a technique \"sort of like origami\" folding/tucking the skin and sewing it back down. It was not painful at all & is healing nicely. I just had to wear a \"donut\" of gauze to protect it for the first 2 weeks, so that the new nipple wouldn't be smooshed flat by the jog bra.",
