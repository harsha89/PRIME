      "Content": "Hi Linda, I too am a teacher of 27 years. I teach high school and college students. I started my breast cancer treatment last February after having a biopsy and a lumpectomy. I was totally honest with my students right from the start. I needed them to know because I never miss school. I needed them to know that I would look different and may act different. My administration, faculty, and students were absolutely wonderful. My kids got to pick out which of my wigs I would wear. My high school calculus class even secretly sent me two different ones. My high school also raised $5000 for Susan G. Komen in honor of me. I ended up having a bilateral mastectomy in July and started school this year, leaving during my planning periods for 38 radiation treatments. The entire school celebrated my last radiation day on Oct. 20. They are now behind me again because some of the cancer cells have gone into my back bones. I have started chemo again and this is probably the last week with my own hair. Again, I have been honest with my kids and they have let me know that they are there for me. I can only tell you that the support you receive helps as much as the medicine. Let the kids help you through this and, God forbid, if any of them face this in the future, they will use you as their shining example of Grace Under Fire and know that it is doable and nothing to be asahmed of. I wish you nothing but success as you start your journey. If there is anything else I can possible help with, please let me know. I go back for treatment #2 this Thursday. Keep your chin up and let your kids share your journey. Kathy",
