      "Content": "Diuagnosed with IDC and had a partial mastectomy this past Monday. Received only partial results of my pathology report, as doctor was out of office. Was informed the margin area was negative, which is good, but am grade 3 of 3. Was told the Stage and the T size would be give at time of oncology appointment. I have been told I will probably be having chemo, radiation and some form of pill. What concerns me is the Grade 3 of 3. My tumor size was approximately the size of a quarter. No lymph node involvment. So far, does this all sound pretty positive outcome?",

      "Content": "Just diagnosed with Stage 2 IBC---meeting with ocologist on the 15th to find out what course of treatment I will need. No lymph node involvement. Whew! Did I read someplace on here that you need a pap before your chemo treatments? Also, due to some severe anesthesia reactions in past, have never had a colonoscopy...will I need to get one before chemo? Thinking of all the appointments I will need just to begin chemo. Just had a partial mastectomy last week......so ready to begin the treatment.",
