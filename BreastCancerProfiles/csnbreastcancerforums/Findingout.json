      "Content": "So it's 13 days since my first chemo and my hair is supposed to start falling out soon. I keep checking but so far, not... except maybe a little extra in the shower. They say not to order a wig until it really starts to fall out, but there are other items I wonder if I should jump on. Like - the net to catch my hair in bed? Once that starts happening, it might take a few days to get the order online and meanwhile... what, hair all over the place? (I hardly want more house cleaning; changing the bedding is enough exertion.) I guess I'm pretty sure it's going to fall out (having AC now) Dr. and nurses said, it WILL fall out. It helps me to prepare. What was your experience? Did you get the net in advance? Did you shave it off or let it fall out bit by bit? (I guess that would be really messy) I did survive the first chemo and starting exactly on day 9 felt human again. :-) Thanks again for your expertise, & hugs, LynD (I read the warning about protecting our identity in our comments so I'm signing a little differently but it's still me)",

      "Content": "Hi Kathy, I welcome your rant. Just having started chemo last Thurs I too have doubts; how can something this bad be good for me? By \"this bad\" I just mean that it's killing cells and making me feel lousy. I too question everything but had a fast growing tumor that HAD to be Gone. I'm right there with you, with doubts. I just don't know what else to do. Someone suggested chanting the cancer away. I just don't feel confident enough not to do chemo, and yet have doubts while doing it. It's the biggest catch 22 of my life for sure. I wish I had answers.",
