      "Content": "Glad to hear that you are talking things over so well with your doctor. I have had a laprascopic hysterectomy, but we left the ovaries in. We should have taken the ovaries, but at the time it was what you said, if it's not broken don't fix it. My cancer was hormone positive, hindsight says we should have taken the ovaries out. Anyway, my recovery was so much easier then women I had spoken to who have had the surgery done abdominally. I could do so much more then those women. I just recently finished taking 2 years of Lupron shots, it wasn't fun. I only did the shots because in my case they didn't want to operate and take the ovaries. Given that your body has experienced menopause before maybe the change you experience because of the surgery won't be horribly drastic. Myself, I wish I could have had surgery.",

      "Content": "I don't come here often, today was a good day to be here after reading your comments. I am the patient everyone fears, so it gets lonely and some articles do bother me just like you had stated. I had breast cancer once and did all the things I was told to do, \"charge, bring on the fight\". I got breast cancer again and did everything I thought was possible to keep my cancer away. Now I have mets in 3 bones and had thyroid cancer too. I have done everything possible, I was strong, positive, listened to the doctors, and even kept my faith. Strength is something that I have only a few days a month, positive attitude comes and goes with mood swings and hot flashes, my faith is unwavering, but I find it hard to go to church. I won't allow people to say \"remission\" anymore because it is a \"false hope\". I say, \"for now the cancer has stopped playing PacMan on my bones\". \"God's Will\"? I don't think God willed me to have cancer almost continuously since Jan 1998, I would hope not. As for my destiny, today I have nothing to lose for there may not be a tomorrow, so \"bring on the fun\" screw the war. I ordered a meal in a restuarant that I frequent, so they know me. I asked the waitress to order me the easiest meal to eat because I was just too tired to work at eating that day. She laughed and brought me a bowl with mashed potatoes, peppers, onion, cut up filet mignon, and gravy. I could eat the whole thing with a fork. Until they can bottle strength and put it in my body I will find ways to improvise. Sunshine, vibrant colors, my family, and friends are my strength when I don't have any strength of my own. Thanks for the articles and input, it really made my day.",

      "Content": "I read the other women's recommendations. I agree aquaphor is wonderful and aloe is also great. I have had breast cancer twice, once each breast. I peeled both times, however the first time I had the same time burns as prayerangel and the couldn't give me a break, my husband had to take a week off from work to help with the kids. My radiology nurse gave me burn pads, they were soothing if put in the fridge first, they really helped. Hospitals use these pads for burn patients, you can just lay them on the problem area and relax for awhile. Hope this helps, glad you got a break. I used deodorant every day after a treatment, didn't really need to shave much, nerve damage from lymph node dysection. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi, I wholeheartedly agree with the other women. You need to have an Oncologist that you have confidence in and who will take care of you. As for your feelings, I can relate to them. I have had 2 breast cancers, thyroid cancer, and Mets. We move around a lot so I have to get new doctors every 2 years or so. It is a lonely and fearful not knowing who your doctor is going to be. I cried once when one of my doctors quit, it's okay. I feel the same way you do sometimes, I want to know there is a safety net. My body is a train wreck, I need to know my doctors are there for me. So, I say take charge of your own medical care, even if it is scary. Once you get the doctors you want you will be able to settle down. Keep a log of all your procedures, treatments, and medications. Our last move I didn't have all my records in hand, however I was able to had my Oncologist my own medical log, he was impressed and able to work with me without having all my records. Oh yeah, we are moving AGAIN the end of May. I was only diagnosed last March with the thyroid and METS so I am not happy to be moving again and finding new doctors. Fortunately my doctor here is going to help hook me up with a doctor in Vegas. My husbad retired from the Air Force and has job in Vegas of all places. He is there for 4 months without me, our son is graduating High School this year so I am staying behind. It sucks, but I don't want to move our son 4 months before graduation. My husband left last week.",
