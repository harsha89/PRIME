    "Content": "I have stage IV breast cancer and I am participating in a study where I receive ixempra and avastin once a week for three weeks, then one week off. I just finished the second round and I am having the worst week yet of side effects. I anticipated some side effects being cumulative in effect, but not stuff like diarhea, nausea, chills, stuff like that. Has anybody else experienced an increase in intensity of side effects as treatment goes along?",
