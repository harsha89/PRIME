I am a little prejudiced because I have a son who is a flight controller for the space station in the area of life support and his wife works in the heart lab for NASA --I am so proud of them so please forgive me for bragging a little on them but they are \"good people\" and have been so supportive of me with my BC too. These programs are in so much jeopardy now because of budget cuts and it pains me to see our nation turn its back on the sciences. Being from Houston...you are one brave lady to go out in 2F!! This place would freak out if we ever felt 2F!!! We bundle up at 50F; you would laugh at us. We are pitiful!",

Just type in a search engine something like Chemo caps and scarves and lots of sites will come up. Regular caps you just buy at the store seldom cover enough for me but some people put a scarf under them to make-do. Since I can sew a little bit I have actually made some of my favorite caps with little ties on them at the back or side. I made the pattern after looking at a couple I bought and realized how simple it would be to make them. PM me if you would like my self-made pattern and I can send you a copy. It only takes a little material and about a half an hour to make one. Guess you can tell I went a little head cover crazy :) but I like variety. Love from Pink.",

My hair was about midneck length and I kept enough of it through the next week so that I didn't need to wear a cap or scarf. By day 18 I decided it was time for a cap or scarf. I had a wig on hand and I am on week 6 of chemo and still haven't worn the wig so think about if you are the wig type or not. The caps and scarves are just more comfortable and secure feeling to me. I haven't shaved my head and doubt I will. Just don't care about it that much and I sort of like the little fuzz I have left. I figure those poor little hairs made it this far through all of those drugs so they can just fall out when and if they want to. We all have our own take on this. I never used a net at all.",
