    "Content": "Hi Marilyn, I cry alot also. I had a bad day yesterday and got myself so worked up that I was a complete wreck! I called my husband at work crying and I know that upsets him. I told him that I wanted a test that I read about called an amas test. Antimalignant antibody serum test or something. They say that it can detect cancer cells 18 months before the standard tests can. I am my own worst enemy here. I can convince myself that the worst is coming. My daughters friend's grandmother just passed away last weekend from bc and that got to me. I hear about someone passing and I get so depressed. You are not alone! We just need to channel this energy somewhere else! JoAnne",
