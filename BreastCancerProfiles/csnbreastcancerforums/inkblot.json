(not during chemotherapy, however) It is also one of the few \"natural\" approaches which the NCI condones. If you go to: www.nci.nih.gov and go to alternative/complementary treatments, you'll find some great info there..from studies, etc.. According to their info, CoQ10 has proven to be particularly beneficial for those with breast cancer. GOOD STUFF TO KNOW. Love, light and laughter, Ink",

      "Content": "Hi rose: I'm assuming that your itching happens after chemo? I never had itching anyplace else on my body, but my forearm, while being infused, turned red and itched incredibly. It happened mildly during the first infusion of AC. During the 2nd infusion, it was much worse and was scarlet red and began to swell too. My onc told the nurse to stop infusion and I was given a large dose of Benadryl in the IV and treatment resumed. It was, she said, a local allergic reaction, so I always received the Benadryl prior to the remaining treatments, in addition to the Decadron. Quite a trip! Did you mention this lingering itchiness to your onc and if so what did he/she think? Perhaps ask your doctor about trying Benadryl at home to help control it? Just a thought. Hoping you find relief soon! Love, light and laughter, Ink",

      "Content": "Hi Maggs: So good to hear that our sharing about death and dying was helpful for you. That's what we're all about here. I too found the discussion interesting. Some of the ladies here are highly religious in the Christian fashion (as evidenced by frequent biblical quotes, open prayers to Jesus, with amens and hallelujah's). I believe that whatever gets one through life's greatest challenges is a good thing for them as long as we remember that there is no one single philosphy which we all embrace and therefore, maintain sensitivity for everyone here, regardless of religious persuasion. Strength is found is many beautiful places and we're all forutnate when we come together here to share, find strength and give strength, just as we are, without any prerequisites based on color, creed, national origin, religious/political affiliations, sexual orientations, etc.. Just us bc survivors, living, laughing, crying, caring, sharing and supporting one another. Geral: Good for you in becoming an organ donor. Was that before your cancer? I'm wondering if that program carries any of the restrictions that donating blood carries? (Once you've had chemo, you're no longer able to donate blood. If one has radiation only, then one can resume donating after five years have passed. This according to the Medical Director's office of the Red Cross) About free Last Will & Testament: You can draw up your own but must have two witnesses sign it and it must be notarized. That standard is accepted in most states, but check with the Clerk of Court in your own state to find out if there are any additional requirements when making your own Will. There are also some good books available to help you make your own will, which explain some of the commonly used terms such as \"devisee\", etc.. Hope that helps. Hope everyone is staying well!

I'd imagine that you're both in a period of absolute disbelief and confusion. It isn't easy but your fiance will find ways of coping while supporting you as well. His getting educated about breast cancer can also be very helpful.

      "Content": "Hi Ellison: I know how upset and frightened you are right now. At least part of that misery is unnecessary! Here's why: Doctor should never tell someone: \"I don't like what I'm seeing\" and then not elaborate at all on the statement. That she concluded by saying if you didn't hear from her, to keep your next appointment, is ridiculous, since it's some time in the future. Here's how it could have gone better, with a bit of caring and sensitivity on the docs part: \"Your right side looks like arthritis but I'd like some more studies on the left side...we'll get some films and labs tomorrow and I'll ring you as soon as we get the \"stat\" results. How difficult is that? When I refer to stupid doctor's on this website, how yours handled this is an example of what comes to mind. A complete lack of sensitivity by our doctor and we can go bonkers in 24 hours or less! Leaving you to imagine and conjure up vile images of the worst is not kind or thoughtful at all and it's completely unnecessary! Scenario: Say I'm your long time good friend and neighbor and we know and trust one another. I ring you up at 3 a.m. on a dark, foggy night and tell you that I think I see a prowler on your porch but go on to say that I think you should just go back to sleep and that we'll call the police a week from Thrusday! You're my friend who was robbed and assaulted in your own home, just the previous year, so what kind of thoughtless person am I and how terrified and nuts are you going to be by the time the sun comes up, the fog clears and next Thrusday gets here??? After all, the possible prowler isn't on MY porch! Dramatic analogy, but isn't this doing the same thing to a cancer survivor when a doctor rings us up and says things like this? It's cruel. It's no mystery that you've planned the funeral!!! My thought is that you should ring your doctor's office and speak directly with her. Ask about the status of the labs and films. It's time to advocate for yourself. This is your body, your life and your decision. Unless you're ok with it, you don't have to sit around for an extended period of time, in pain and scared beyond words. Not knowing is worse than knowing the worst and you have the right to insist on getting to the bottom of it in a timely fashion. Not at someone else's convenience. My heart aches for the position you're in. We've all had to wait for tests, etc. but your waiting seems overly long, particularly after the doc saying she doesn't like what she sees? Following chemo and/or rads, our bodies can do some strange things, so all pains, even one's lasting a long time, are not cancer. One of my early bugs was having several of the tendon sheaths in my body become inflamed. Specialist said this is not really uncommon following chemo. Oncologist, (you guessed it) said she'd never heard of this happening before! I had some persistent hip pain on the right side and after x-rays, MRI's, nothing was there, just some mild inflammation in that tendon and sheath. It finally healed, thank goodness. My right wrist and hand weren't so lucky. After over a year of trying bracing, injections, pills, cold, heat, physical therapy, etc., I finally submitted to surgery and that fixed it. The next summer I took a spill on the pool deck (trust me, you wouldn't even want the details of that fall) and again found myself braced, on crutches, wrapped, a cast on one ankle, a broken great toe, a torn ACL, things sprained and strained and naturally, my tendons chose this time to flare again, just to compound things. It was quite a trip. So, when I have aches or pains, I haven't a clue if it's the result of damage from the fall, the chemo or if the cancer is coming back! Know what I do? If it isn't excruciating, I continue with light Yoga, rest overall a bit more than ususal and just wait and see. I prefer to think that nothing is cancer, rather than everything IS. If it ever is cancer again, then maybe I'll have a good reserve of energies to deal with it because I'll have spared myself fear and worry ahead of time. It's just what works for me. Thoughtless doctor's can certainly impact our resolve and our ability to remain calm and focused though. All the more reason to advocate strongly when necessary and fight to keep our emotions balanced, while we wait. Try to listen to the \"facts\" in what your doctor's say and put less emphasis on what they may \"muse\" about in their thoughtless approach. I noticed that you've got yourself going into chemo again already. First, it's YOUR decision whether you will ever have chemo again, even if it's indicated. No one can dictate treatment to you. In retrospect, when I think of my own chemo experience, I wouldn't be ready to walk out the door tomorrow and have another dose of it either but if I felt that it was in my best interests to go for it again, then I likely would. I'd want no one pushing me in such a decision though. I know I'd have to decide for myself. Any decision would depend upon quite a few factors. None of us can know exactly how we'd decide until it's before us really, so why try in advance? Probably a good idea to cancel that chemo appointment you have in your head! LOL Try to ease your horse back in front of the cart for now and since you've already envisioned the worst, try to envision the best. Can't hurt and may help you feel better while you're waiting. Hoping you get those results SOON! Become a demanding \"QB\" if you have to and please keep us posted on how you're doing in the interim. Love, light and laughter, Ink",

      "Content": "Hi Maggs: I'm sorry to hear that your markers are increasing. Do keep in mind that these markers are still a somewhat new tool for the docs and they're just really learning how to use them. As explained to me by my doc, after I finished chemo and learned that checking them would be a routine part of my follow ups, she said: the tumor markers are not exact and we are just learning what they mean and how to use them as an evaluation tool. She further explained to me that things other than cancer can effect the numbers and that unless they get up there and remain up, only then do they begin to look for a reason, with further testing, etc.. If a person is having symptoms AND the markers are considerably up, then they begin looking for a reason immediately. She told me that often, no reason can be found, particularly when no specific symptoms accompany the rise. In other words, we can't yet hang our hats on the marker numbers alone. For whatever that's worth, I wanted to share it with you. About dying: I think for most people, it's more a fear of the unknown. Notwithstanding whatever belief system we choose to live by, when it comes time to die, and if we have the time to contemplate it, none of us knows, for certain, what's out there or what happens to that \"essence\" of us...our souls or spirits, if you will. When we're relatively young and have not had a full life span, the very idea of dying seems a big cheat. An unfair thing to have happen. Perhaps we're not ready to say good bye to our loved ones and our lives here. Maybe we're not \"finished\" living or loving yet. But when we're older, maybe we are more accepting of this natural conclusion to our lives here? Less afraid of that unknown and more ready to say our good byes and let go. Maybe this isn't always related to \"age\" and the time we've spent here but there seems to be a connection. We utilize such a tiny fraction of our brains in a conscious manner and so many times, it seems to be that our brains take over and save us extreme fear and anguish, when death is near or in any time of great emotional pain. Most of us have heard of someone, who is dying, actually having conversations with very dear ones who passed away years and years before. Many people attach a religious and/or spiritual reason to that happening. Much of science attaches other reasons. A scientific explanation is that when we are experiencing extreme stress, the emotional centers of our brain create or return to the more satisfying experiences of our lives and that can often involve someone we loved very deeply and dearly. A sort of \"protective\" mechanism. It makes sense to me that if we also have a particular religious/spiritual belief system, this also comes into play and may explain why some people who are dying may say that a particular loved one has \"come for them\", etc.. We're such complex creatures and it's absolutely overwhelming what our brains can do and create. Extreme grief/bereavement can also cause us to \"see\" our deceased loved one visiting us or bringing us messages and the like \"from the other side\" or we feel their presence strongly. The reverse seems to happen too. When we lose someone dear or experience extreme emotional pain or shock, we can again suffer effects of all our previous losses and hurts in our lives as our emotions sort of tie it all together in some way. Like people suffering PTSD or disassociative disorders, because it's just all too much and one event seems to sets it all in motion. I have friends who are believers in traditional religions, eastern religions, agnostics and athiests. With this eclectic group, the subject of death comes up and we've had more than a few conversations on this subject. From that, it does seem that there is a direct relation to what one believes in and what one experiences at death. There is also a difference in how different belief systems effect one's preparation for death. The only thing I haven't decided for myself is whether or not it is preferable to know that death is coming or to have it come suddenly and unexpectedly. I think there are benefits and negatives to each. I would say, today, that I am not afraid to die. Yet, if I had weeks or months advance notice, so to speak, would I remain unafraid? Would I live any differently, if I knew my time to die was within a certain time frame? Probably not as I live in a way that if I died tomorrow, there wouldn't be anything important left unsaid or undone. Yet I can't know for sure until I find myself in that position. The raw truth is that from the day we're born, our bodies are dying. Not unlike a vegetable garden plant, the seed becomes the plant, which grows in a certain, genetically prescribed fashion. It will likely thrive and produce fruit but not if fungus or certain other diseases attack. A spring hailstorm can kill the plant before it ever has the chance to bloom. Genetic and/or environmental factors can shorten the plants lifespan or it can thrive, survive and die a natural death with Fall's first frost, just as nature intended. I think we all want to live until our time of frost and so we have the surgeries, take the drugs, fortify ourselves with supplements, healthy diets and healthier lifestyles in an effort to live longer and live well. Yet, as survivors, we know better than many, that there are no guarantees. The tough part is in learning to live in a way that reflects that fact, without constant fears and worries which sap our strength and debilitate us emotionally. Again, the root of so much of our fear, seems to be the fear of dying. Those of us who have been through a lot of physical pain, side effects and complications, also have fears of experiencing that kind of pain again. That fear is well justified too! We are faced with so many questions and so many issues and the truth is that the answers can only be found inside ourselves. Only we can decide how long we want to fight, how far we're willing to go in order to continue living, what risks we're willing to take. Only we can decide when we're willing to say: OK, enough, I'm going out in my own way. No one else can make that decision for us. No one else should ever try. As you said, Maggs, we're all going to die at some point. It's a natural conclusion to living. The only question is when. I think the majority of us though, tend to live our lives with little or no serious thought to our own dying, which places us in a bit of a fantasy mode of living. If we could think more often and deal more often with the fact that we're all going to die, we may live better and more completely. I agree with you that as a society, we don't discuss it well or often and mostly avoid the subject. Yet it is a very real and undeniable part of our living and I think its a good thing to acknowledge it and kick it around a bit. Yet we cannot develope a perspective if we do not think about it or talk about it openly and honestly. A thing which happens sometimes is that some people who do know they are dying, have many regrets about this or that. I think that's probably the saddest thing of all. To die with regrets about one's living. Yet, if we talked more about it and got rid of some of our fears about it, perhaps we'd be less likely to have regrets about how we chose to live. Many will say they just didn't realize or know and that their lives seemed to go by so quickly or their children grew up while they were so busy with other things in life and they missed out on a lot, which suddenly seems important. Sort of a day late and a dollar short realization. I think I fear that kind of scenario more than I would ever fear dying. Yet if I went about my merry way with no thought to the fact that my lifetime is indeed limited, I'd likely end up with regrets when my time arrived. Seems logical to give some thought to the fact that death is indeed coming...through a fall down the stairs, on the highway, a sudden fatal heart attack, disease, illness, syndrome or condition (and less often, drowning,suicide or murder)and none of knows when it's coming or how painful or quiet the passing will be. Particularly, we don't know if we'll have time to say any goodbyes or have a second chance to try to repair any regrets we may have. Better, to my way of thinking, to see to it that everyday is well lived in loving and giving and leaving no doubt in the minds of your loved ones that they matter a great deal to you. If it sneaks up on me, then I'm good to go, so to speak. Not that I'd want to go, if given a choice, but I'd be OK in the knowledge that none of my life's stones had grown moss and that I did my best not to fiddle while Rome was burning. It's a tremendous subject and one I think we could benefit from discussing more often and more thoroughly and I'm not uncomfortable talking about it here. As we strive to live better, it seems only natural to me that we also strive to find perspective about and a more conscious understanding of the fact that we're all going to die. To share our thoughts about it. Another way to support one another. I think it's great, Maggs, that you've opened a dialogue about it. It has been said many times, that nothing is taboo here. So, amidst the sermons, our sharing of experiences, pain and gain, pain and disappointment, triumph and newly found strengths, we can also certainly share our thoughts and feelings about death and dying and perhaps benefit from it in the process.

Although it is not noted for causing hair loss, etc. and most people have fewer side effects compared to A/C, it is, nontheless, quite a potent drug. Most doctor's order a MUGA scan (cardiac screening) or an Echocardiogram, prior to beginning Herceptin, something you may want to ask your doc about. You can go to: www.nci.nih.gov and go to \"breast cancer\" and then to \"types of treatment\" and you will find quite a bit of info re Herceptin, which may be beneficial to you.

When we lose a friend to the same disease we have experienced, it can serve to heighten our own fears, and we may find ourselves thinking, \"that could have been me...why did hers come back and mine hasn't\". All normal thoughts, I think. I've had them myself. You are right though, there are no answers to why. Why me? Why her? Why any of us really. Science cannot unravel the mystery on a scientific basis and we can't seem to unravel it on a mystical/religious, practical or logical basis.

I am sure that in the months to come you will draw strength and inspiration from your friends battle, as you remember her, as well as how she chose to live her life and fight her disease. That is a testament to her strength and example. I believe this is something we can all hope for: that when we're gone, our lives, who we were and what we were about will continue to serve someone, on some level, which is positive and good.

Any unusual bruising or rashes should always be looked at right away. Just guessing that the rash could be any number of things. Irritation from soaps, deodorants, shaving, etc.. Keep in mind that the irradiated skin could remain sensitive for quite some time and may require special attention. The bruising, in my thinking, is of greater concern and I wouldn't wait a month to have onc. check it out. Your counts should be checked asap and proceed from there. Sometimes we bump ourselves and don't even really register it and that could be all it is but it's wise to get to the bottom of it. Keep us posted and enjoy the New Year!

Since you carefully wash these raw foods I'm not aware of any reason NOT to eat these goodies from nature sans cooking them. (I lightly steam a lot of stuff, as I find it really makes the flavor pop) I have several friends who are seriously into \"juicing\" and they put every veggie imaginable into their juicers and drink every drop, several times daily and it causes them no problems and they swear by its benefits. Actual foods are the prefered method of getting one's vitamins and minerals. Research has shown that some nutritional elements are not nearly as well absorbed/utilized from supplements as they are from the actual food product. Example: Licopene. It's a great element but is only well utilized when actually eaten as cooked tomatoes (tomato sauce, ketchup, tomato paste, tomato juice, stewed, etc.) Many supplement manufacturers have jumped on the Licopene bandwagon and market it heavily, but it's practically worthless in a manufactured form, according to the research. I'm a lifelong ovo-lacto vegetarian and as such I routinely consume some strange combinations of foods. Necessary to get complete proteins and because I really like them in whatever combinations. I also take those supplements which I believe in and which have proven helpful to me. I'm hooked on fruits and veggies...preferring organically grown when available, and I like them both cooked and raw. One thing I do take the time to attend to, however, is the removal of seeds from everything possible. Reason is that chemicals such as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, etc. are more concentrated in the seeds of fruits and veggies(cucumbers for example). To take that one neurotic step further, even organically grown veggies are not certified as grown in \"chemical free\" soil...foods may be organically grown but the soil they're grown in could have well become contaminated years ago...so there you have it. Peels are also to be removed, even though they often contain some of the higher concentrations of vitamins/minerals. Reason: they absorb very high amounts of contaminants (particularly root veggies such as potatoes, radishes, carrots, beets, and onions, etc.) I prefer my whole grain breads processed. I make some of my own and buy some as well. Healthy eating demands some thought and time commitment as was already mentioned but I beleive it's an effort well worth the benefits for those so inclined. I say do what works for you and whatever you have the strongest feelings about. You seem well versed and informed about what you're doing. Info is critical when adopting a non-mainstream diet and I'm sure you have that under your belt. So, just two words: Happy munching. Good luck and my best wishes for a complete recovery with many healthy years ahead, in which to enjoy and expand upon your raw foods lifestyle. Love, luck and laughter, Ink",

Your doc could do with a swift kick in the you- know-what for not following protocol with the MUGA'S/ECHO'S to track your ejection fractions and I know you're just the lady to give it to him! Most all the literature states that Adria. alone can cause some to have heart problems, as can Herceptin, and that the two combined, can increase the chances of cardiac problems. What was he thinking? And you're so right...we have to advocate for ourselves, try to stay on top of everything imaginable and then tell our docs not only what we think we need but justify it as well. You did great in pressing your doc to do the right thing. I'm happy to know that you've responded well to the new meds and hope the level of improvement continues and that you're already feeling more energetic. What is the plan re the Herceptin now? A temporary hiatus until the fractions improve? So good that you had a much-needed rest while in hospital. Wondering if the hospital you were in offers those new \"gourmet\" meals yet? They're touted to be absolutely delicious so hope you got to sample some of the latest, greatest hospital cuisine. Keep the faith and keep us posted! Love, light and laughter, Ink",

      "Content": "Hey lynne, I had Sentinel Node Bx. Healed quickly with no complications. (Yoga definitely helped with regaining range of motion) It is my understanding that the advantage of SLND is that it can spare more nodes while also reducing risk of lympedema. In my case, (lumpectomy) both a dye and radioactive tracer were injected prior to surgery. My surgeon used the light as well as a different device to trace the radioactive agent. Three nodes lit up and were removed for immediate preliminary pathology. My surgeon got the info back from the lab (while I was still under)that none of the 3 nodes showed evidence of cancer and so he didn't remove any additional nodes. I was pleased to learn that upon waking up from surgery. Not the end of the story however. My nodes were pathologically investigated later, using a more sophisticated test, different from the preliminary tests. One of the 3 nodes taken (in my case the node determined to be the actual Sentinel Node) had precisely 7 micro (immature) cancer cells. I saw the slides and could actually count them. The other 2 nodes taken were clean and I remained happy with my decision to have SLND, as did my surgeon. (You have the right to have your path slides sent to any other examining facility you choose...or you can pick them up and take them with you, for 2nd opinions) When I was going through second opinions, (re adjunctive treatment, as I'd already had surgery) the surgeon I consulted with said that she would have wanted to take more nodes, due to those 7 micro cells, even though it would have required an additional surgery. I, however, would not have wanted more nodes removed on that basis alone, due on my research, talk with other surgeons and my gut feeling) I saw a team at one of the 2nd opinion facilities (surgeon, radiation onc. and medial onc.) The medical onc there was also more aggressive-minded and his advice was more aggressive chemo, with more rounds and even a trial! I was Stage 1, one cm tumor. That felt way over the top to me. Just proves that not all great minds really do think alike! LOL Education, tempered with a bit of caution and taking a bit of time to get the info you need, is important. I ultimately had 2 second opinions before feeling prepared to make my best decisions. If you've talked with your surgeon in detail about nodes, then you may already know that the nodes are inside what looks like a concave sponge. Axillary nodes are quite small. I know because my surgeon showed me some nodes. Some are embedded deeply into the dense, spongy tissue and naturally, the trauma of removing them can present more risk of nerve damage and future pain, etc.. Removing the entire sponge they are in, is simpler than poking about to locate and remove a few. For the surgeon, that is. Still, many women who have practically all their nodes removed, don't experience any complications. Decision making about this can seem a bit over-whelming but my advice is in line with what the other ladies here have recommend: Research and get all the solid info you can prior to surgery. I strongly recommend at least one 2nd opinion. Then, make whatever decision feels most right and comfortable for you. We are all different. Our anatomy is different and our gut feelings are different. It's important to feel that we've made the most informed and best decisions for ourselves and have no regrets. Re your question on what difference it makes anyway, if you've already had chemo, prior to surgery: I have no idea. My chemo was post surgery. I would venture to guess however, that chemo pre-surgery would be an entirely different scenario and that is an important question which should be addressed with your doctor(s). Getting answers to such questions is paramount to being able to make your most informed decisions. It is our doctors responsibility to answer all of our questions to the best of their ability. If they don't want to be bothered or cannot, then that's probably a red flag. Don't hesitate to see your doc, armed with your questions written down. Jot down the answers as you go. Or if your doc is comfortable with it, take a voice recorder along. Whatever works best, but don't make decisions without having your questions answered to your satisfaction and in language that you can understand. Anything less from a doctor is not, in my humble opinion, a good level of patient care. Warm hugs and good wishes for getting the chemo behind you and having an uncomplicated, smooth surgery! You've found a good place for sharing information, concerns and issues. I hope that it will be as helpful you as it has been to myself and so many others. Love, light & laughter, Ink",

      "Content": "Hi Jean: Sorry you've been going through an angry period. Sometimes though, just giving the anger expression is purging. No sense in pretending it doesn't exist when you're in the throes of it. As you know, I too was strongly Her/2neu but want to remind you that there is no standardized test for Her2. You can get different numbers at different laboratories. Too, we have to realize that Her2 was around during our Grandmother's time...scientists just weren't aware of it and had no way of recognizing it. Many women, even today, are not tested for it. I had my own tests repeated at different facility and still came up with a 3+. Do I trust that 100%? Of course not. Yet I don't dwell on it. We still have ordinary aches and pains. Pulled muscles can take weeks to heal well. Arthritis still plagues people. Tendonitis still besets people as does the flu and other maladies. It isn't easy after having had cancer to figure out when we need to have some speicalized testing done. We can only listen to our bodies, which we know better than anyone else ever will, and follow our instincts. Which is what you did. Doctor's don't have a crystal ball either. Yet if they don't order tests when you intuitively know that you need one, then it's time to bid that doctor goodbye. We cannot advocate for ourselves if our doctor's don't truly listen to us, since we don't have the authority to write a script for a test or drug. So, try to lighten up on blaming yourself Jean. Following my dx, I had a big go with anger. During that time, I blamed everything I could think of and then some. I was on a tear about it big time! I just had to let it go and sling left and right and get it out I suppose. I didn't feel ashamed about feeling angry either. I surmised that I had the right. It dissipated, as I recall, after about a week of rolling round in it. Just something I had to go through I guess. The best we can do is decide how we're going to manage what we truly can manage, adopt an attitude which serves us well and go with it. Full speed ahead. I'm with you on the no looking back and no backtracking. Forward is the only way to go. Self blame or system blame doesn't net us much. We CAN choose to \"fire\" our docs though when they are not providing the level of care we need and deserve. Factually, women who are strongly Her2/neu positive and those who are negative, both get mets/recurrences. I've yet to see anything supporting that Her2/neu women get mets, recurrences any sooner or more often than non-Her/2neu women. There's no rhyme or reason. For what it's worth, my doctor says that doing \"routine\" scans, MRI's, etc. doesn't really help them to find mets any sooner. Typically, a \"search\" is based upon patient pain and/or complaints. Otherwise, one could have a bone scan and be told everything is fine, only to have a metastasis ongoing in the lung, liver or elsewhere. My doctor as well as the doctor's of some friends with bc, say that neither tumor marker tests, scans or anything else really helps them find a met any sooner than they typically find it on symptomology. The nature of cancer is one big grey area as best anyone can seem to determine. And as difficult as the drugs are to take, as arduous as radiation can be, it's the only thing we've got available and we must be grateful for it. We have to make our choices and carry on, hoping for the best. As for advocacy...well, ACS is a self proclaimed advocate, as are so many other organizations. All of them, however, can only provide info to us that already exists. As for the money...All that fund raising has to end up somewhere and so it goes into research, programs for those diagnosed, undergoing treatment, etc.. Some of it, of course, also goes to salaries as well as to policical lobbying efforts, etc.. Cancer is a multi billion dollar business and although we don't like that fact much, we have to accept that this is part of the equation. Without the \"fringes\" and profitability, research would come to a screeching halt. No one would be exploring anything new, innovative or promising. It's a big wheel and those of us with cancer are just one spoke in it. The quality of our lives only matter in the aggregate to researchers, drug manufacturer's, politician's and on a certain level, even to our personal physician's. They all expound \"stats\", which we all know are meaningless when applied to any individual. Just makes it even more important that we take the initiative and DEMAND when we need to, if that's what's required to get the medical attention/treatments we need. A real \"cure\" is probably out there, somewhere, but in the meantime, we must focus upon prevention as much as possible and take the best care we can of ourselves and those we love. Share info about health hazards in our food, air and water, clothing, cosmetics, OTC drugs, household fabrics, factories and farms and thereby, hope to keep ourselves informed, so that we can take steps to avoid all that we logically can, in order to try to stay healthier. I'm so happy that you're feeling better! That's what really counts in the right here, right now scheme of things. A day with less pain, a day with more joy, a greater sense of spirit and knowing that we can share it all with not only our loved one's and friends, but here, with our sisters. Hang in and trust me, \"venting\" is good! Love, light and laughter, Ink",

      "Content": "Hi Tara: Happy to see you're still posting here. It's been forever since I've been on the site and popped in yesterday to see how everyone is doing and found sooo many great new people posting. About this contamination thing: Yes, there's no doubt that our environment, including our air, water, foods and soils are contaminated and not just a little. Depending upon where we live, some areas are worse than others. So many chemicals all around us and in our bodies, it's more like an invisible soup we swim through ever day. So, not surprisingly we see more diseases and conditions arising in each generation. While some of the toxins we're exposed to cause cancers, others cause nerve damage, mental dysfunction and a whole array of medical anomalies. Some take many years to cause symptoms while exposure to others can produce illness faster. There are a few things we can do to try to cut down on our exposure to environmental toxins, including becoming an educated consumer, but no way to escape them completely without leaving the planet. Our best bet is to join with reputable enviro groups and contribute whatever we can in the way of activism to try to effect positive change. We can never stop working to this ends. I have been involved with several environmental groups for many, many years and we stay busy with letter writing to our legislators in the US as well as addressing environmental issues abroad. Once in a while, we actually win a small battle and that feels terrific but mostly money talks and everything else walks, including those of us who work to try to preserve our lovely little planet. Greed and thoughtless action are the wheels which drive our economny (health and safety don't get much, if any consideration) and that spells disaster for us all. Animal species are going extinct at an alarming rate, worldwide. Our rain forests are slashed and burned, farmed for 2 to 3 years and then become deserts as the nutrients in the soil are depleted rapidly and the farmers move on to another newly slashed and burned area. Some whales are so very toxic that they are handled as \"biohazards\" when they beach themselves, die and must be removed. This should tell us something? The big business public relations spin doctors employed by the biggest offenders, including our own governments (you know...those public servants entrusted with watching over our collective welfare) never sleep so we must take care in what we're willing to believe when we're told \"not to worry\" about this or that. It's up to us to educate ourselves and decide how much \"public relations pablum\" we'll listen to on any given day. Often times, we're afraid and really WANT to believe the upbeat, no-need-to-worry reports (\"it wasn't as bad as we initially thought and we've got it under control\" they say with a broad smile) but many times if we can just read between the lines and have knowledge of the issue, we know better than to buy it. Environmentally speaking, Pandora's Box is flung wide open and while little can ever be put back into that box, we can work to stop more from coming out of there! But back to the health consequences: Go to: www.ewg.org/reports/bodyburden2/ This is a report done by Environmental Working Group which can be an eye opener to those of us who may still believe that all is well in paradise. Far from it! The report speaks for itself. Hope that may shed some light for anyone interested in a more indepth look at what's happening in our environment. There are many links for more info from the above referenced site. Love, light and laughter, Ink",

Perhaps he'd feel \"left out\" if you go with your daughter when he doesn't want to go? Hard to say. You know your mate better than anyone else and only you can decide what his needs are and how to balance that with your own needs. Sometimes, it's just difficult for those closest to us to adjust to our life-changes and attitude changes, post cancer. I'd suggest talking with him to make sure that he understand how much you appreciate and love him and that you aren't leaving him behind, but rather, doing something good for yourself. If YOU don't feel that you're being selfish, then proceed accordingly...if, however, you're having doubts about it, then take the time to rethink it and in the end you'll make the choice which is just right for you while taking your husband's feelings into consideration as well.

Just rest up and take good care of yourself in preparing for the upcoming chemo. For me, it wasn't so difficult. Many women get through it really well. The hair loss is typically inevitable but with the anti-nausea meds, etc., the majority of women just don't experience nausea as much of a problem anymore. If you can keep up some daily walking and/or some type of light exercise regimen, it will really make a difference. Yoga was something which wasn't overly taxing but was really beneficial for me. It also helped me to heal faster from surgery and restored my mobility very quickly. Find whatever works best for you and stick with it. Keep that great positive attitude and good luck.

Common sensical dietary/health habits, together with supplements which you've discussed with your Mom's doctor's, is always good. However, be very cautious regarding anything making unsubstantiated/unproven claims about curing cancer. Some so-called non-convential, miracle \"cures\" for diseases can actually be harmful, in addition to failing to do anything positive aside from gobbling up your money. Consult a good Naturopathic Physican and/or Nutritionist, in addition to your Mom's doctor, before trying anything not regulated. In the US, items not regulated by the FDA are pretty much a \"buyer beware\" scenario. If you're outside the US, then your Mom's physican should be able to direct you to the proper agency for more info. Stay strong and good luck. Ink",

      "Content": "Hi Marilyn: I never had the port, so can't respond to that part of it, however I don't recall anyone saying that it was a particularly painful experience. I didn't get real facial hair, following treatment, rather a kind of fuzz going on just in front of my ears where my hariline ends. About an inch down the side of my face, I'm guessing. It wasn't there before and I was a bit concerned and wondered what on earth I'd do if it became dark and course or grew all over my person. Perish the thought! No one else could see it but I could, especially in the light of my makeup mirror. It went away about a year after treatment and just when I was getting used to it! LOL I actually no longer noticed it or worried about it as it hadn't seem to change at all. Hoping that some of the other ladies here can offer their experiences to reassure you. Re your tiredness: It seems that it's been about 10 months since you completed chemo. I'm assuming that your counts are checked regularly at your onc. visits and are normal? I ask because some women's counts never return to pre-treatment levels and if they're borderline, it can contribute to a lack of energy. If you haven't been checked for this, I'd advise doing that as soon as possible, just to know that everything is ok. Another reason may be that your body just needs more time to recover fully. We're all different and some of us need longer to recover than other's. If your fatigue is interferring with your routine and schedule, I'd definitely discuss this in detail with your onc. Also, do you take a daily vitamin or any other supplements? This can often help to rebuild our system following chemo as well as keep our bodies better balanced/maintained. Exercise is another important thing to do for yourself. Just a 15 or 20 minute routine each day can really help in rebuilding the stamina. Maybe start with 10 minutes/day and build up from there. Even a short bike ride or walk is great. If you're eating well and getting adequate rest and your counts are good then it's likely that your body needs more time yet. Your doc should be able to figure out the reason for it and put your mind at ease. Please keep us posted. Good luck with the port coming out! I know you'll be sooo relieved to part company with it.
