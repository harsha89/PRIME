      "Content": "I have received Taxotere with Adriamycin for 6 cycles and my 7th cycle I got on 4/2 was Taxotere alone in a higher dose. I never noticed any problem with my nails until this 7th dose. My fingernails got really sore like someone had hit them with a hammer. Also started looking a little bruised just above the \"moons\". They didn't pull away from the nailbed like yours, but they started cracking like they were made from glass. Aventis, who makes Taxotere, suggests using nail stregthening polish to help the nails stay healthy. I would say try anything that keeps your nails on and if that includes nail glue - go for it. Just keep thinking about when your all done with chemo and everything grows normally again. Keep your eye on the prize (no cancer). Good luck! Ryley",
