    "Content": "Hello Ladies, Funny I should find this post! Long story short: Lumpectomy in 1992, tamoxifen for 5 years, hysterectomy in 1998, recurrence of cancer same breast 2002, mastectomy & reconstruction, back on tamoxifen. Hot flashes will not go away! Surgeon put me on Effexor (anti-depressant). Did not help flashes. Tried to go off and started crying all the time. Was at the Doctor's for something else and told him about crying jags and he said you can't go off cold turkey, you have to be weaned. He also said that it is so mild that I could stay on it indefinitely so I am on it. Oncologist took me off tamoxifen and put on arimidex. Having flashes more often than before. Can't win! I told my family that when I die, please put a fan in the coffin. Sorry for the black humor. See oncologist in May and will ask him if I can take something specifically for the flashes. Good luck and God bless. Kay",
