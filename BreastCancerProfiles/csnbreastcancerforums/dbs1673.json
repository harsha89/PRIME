      "Content": "I was very itchy during my radiation. My Dr had me take an over the counter allergy pill ie benadryl to help with the itching. She preferred this over some of the prescription creams as she didn't want to temper the already tempered skin. I also had an over the counter hydrocortisone cream that I would keep in the freezer. What instant relief with that coldness! Hope this helps!!",

      "Content": "I know there have been may reconstruction questions lately but here is where I'm at. I 've had implants put in for the second time since April. 1st time, not so good with rippling issues. 2nd time (August) MUCH better as more volume helped the problem. I had radiation on the right only. The surgeon feels that working on the left side is no probem for nipple and tatooing but discourages the nipple on the right side due to the effects from the radiation (skin very tight). I was on the fence about this anyway so part of my dicision just got easier. I'm not going to nipple one side. My only decision now is whether or not to tatoo and put a \"finishing dot\" to this whole ordeal. I am very happy now with the implants and appearance. Not sure the anxiety of what it will look like is worth it. Need some feedback on how the \"tatoo only\" really looks for you and if you think it was worth the extra step. as always thanks! dawn",

      "Content": "As I read some of these posts I'm convinced we come from the same family! Seriously, with the exception of my younger brother and his wife, my other siblings and mother are useless. My mother had breast cancer and I had asked her to have the genetic testing done 2 years before I was diagnosed. She refused and told me I need therapy if I'd consider it. Well when I did have the testing done (without therapy) it was negative and I never told her. 2 years later when I was diagnosed all she could think about was did she give this to me. She and my sister were more concerned about keeping their trip to Disney as scheduled 3 days after I came home from my mastectomy. My older brother is a medic and his wife an ER nurse who live less than 2 miles away....never a phone call in the last year. My little sister is the classic complainer about how \"things are so rough, you just can't imagine\" as she seems to go from vacation to vacation. The constant slaps in the face seem to sting even more because they all live within 5-10 miles of my house. I had surgery again in April and all they were worried about was \"you are making the Easter candy, right\"? Their reactions do not surprise me any more but what the head knows does not heal the heart. I'm sure they view me as strong so now I, like many of you, just need to be strong enough to care for ourselves. dawn",

What did help with the relief was getting some over the counter hydrocortizone cream and putting it in the freezer before I applied it. The coldness and the cream itself did help. My radiation oncologist also had me take an over the counter alergy pill to also help. Some people have used stronger prescription creams but my doc didn't recommend those so as not to damage the skin any more. Hope relief finds you soon.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the update Re. So much to consider. I had my expanders removed in April with silicone implants. Had some rippling problems so had them redone 2 weeks ago. I'm much happier with the results. I was small to begin with but it seems a little more volume helped this time. I am so conflicted about the nipples. Maybe it's just too soon to think of another proceedure right now even though it wouldn't be for months until my new girls are ready. I know they will never be \"twins\" but I do want them to be good \"bosom buddies\". It's been 15 months since this started and I never would have guessed the saga would be this long. Then again, maybe getting the nipples is just the \"period\" I need to end this story. dawn",
