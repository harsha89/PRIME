    "Content": "Completed 36 radiation treatments 1 1/2 years ago. Used a crystal deorderant.You underarm hair will never grow back! I bought a cream on line reccomended by Harvard can't remember the name. But no burna and I am very fair. I did all treatments on my lunch break . Considered the treament time as a time in the day for meditation or prayer and that made it a lot easier to bear. Usually more tired after treatment but able to work the rest of the day. Hope this helps.",
