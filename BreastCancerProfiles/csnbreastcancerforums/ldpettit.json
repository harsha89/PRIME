      "Content": "I understand completely. I had my first chemo 6 weeks ago. At week 3 my hair was falling out in clumps and so I went in to have it cut down... I ended up having to shave it as the hair just kept coming out. As I watched each step I cried... and cried... It sucked to say the least. It isn't because I was so connected to my hair or it was that significant, but because now I wasn't just a cancer patient, but now I looked the part too. Now the looks come, now the pitty comes (or so I feel at times from some people)... I have had 2 chemo treatments... I have 54 more to go... taking me well into next year. I bought 2 wigs and a half wig (for hats). I have worn them a few times... mainly because it's too warm to put them on at times. I find I wear the light head coverings more. However, when I wear a wig.... I feel close to normal. If that makes sense. I wish you luck on your shopping adventure. Take a friend or two... make them try on some as well. Make it a fun experience... I did... and it helped. Good luck!",
