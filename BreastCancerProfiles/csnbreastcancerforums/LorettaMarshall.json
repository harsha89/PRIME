    "Content": "Hey Pat \u2013  I\u2019ve been praying for you, but missed your update on your surgery.  I\u2019m Loretta from the Ovarian as well as the Peritoneal Cancer board.  The \u201cfatty lining\u201d is the omentum!  Now I never knew before that I had a \u201cfatty lining\u201d inside my abdomen that could be removed.  However, unfortunately, after surgery, I still had my fatty layer \u201coutside\u201d.  As a matter of fact, I now have a very heavy feeling stomach.  You will remember in our conversations that I had my ovaries, fallopian tubes, gallbladder, spleen, omentum and sections of my intestines removed.   You had the same incision that I had, and sounds like you had Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS), like me.  I really didn\u2019t know what your surgery was going to include.  Good that you were only in the hospital 5 days.  My incision broke open and I had a major infection.  I was in the hospital 42 days!   And boy, did I hate to see those \u201cphysical therapists\u201d pop their head in my hospital room door with a great big grin, and say, \u201cReady to go for a walk?\u201d  Oooohhhh Noooo I wasn\u2019t, but I managed to pull myself off the bed, and with the help of some strong men, I was able to get up and go for that dreaded walk.  And if that wasn\u2019t torture enough, they came in one day, and said, \u201cDo you have steps at home?\u201d  \u201cWell yes I do\u201d was my answer.  So again with a grin, they said, \u201cWell today we\u2019re going to practice going up and down stairs!\u201d  ---- YIPES.  Moreover, riding in an automobile was no easy task either.  I felt every \u201cbump in the road\u201d.  I found that riding with a pillow held tightly to my stomach helped a little.  But \u201clittle by little\u201d I recovered, even though at first I wondered if I would ever be the same again.  Well, today, friends say, \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you have cancer.\u201d  I still have a \u201cfat stomach\u201d.  My weight is steady.  Actually, I \u201ccounted my last calorie\u201d the day I was first diagnosed with \u201cPeritoneal Carcinomatosis.  With a 2nd opinion that was \u201cupgraded\u201d to Ovarian cancer when tumors were also found in my ovaries as well.  So now, for treatment purposes, I am getting the same chemo combo that is often prescribed for Ovarian cancer, although my cancer wasn\u2019t limited to my ovaries.   So check in with us as well.  I must have missed your post, but am glad to know you\u2019re doing well.  I identify totally with the long incision from between the breast to the pubic area!  I long ago exchanged my bikini for a woolen bathing suit that covered the knee.  But I don\u2019t even wear that one now.  Moths have eaten a hole in the knee.  And my knees aren\u2019t exactly what they used to be when I was \u201cthin and young!\u201d  As a matter of fact, I\u2019m lucky to be able to get back up when I get down on my knees.  Hey things quit working as well at age 77, what can I say?  But I\u2019m alive and enjoying a great quality of life for the shape I\u2019m in.  I give God the credit for allowing me to remain sane and I still love to laugh with my family and friends.   Okay, Pat, keep on \u201cgetting\u2019 up\u201d and let us know how you get along with the chemo regimen.  If you haven\u2019t experienced life with chemotherapy, I could share with you some tips that I learned along the way.  I had my first series in the Spring of 2013, then Cytoreductive Surgery on July 1, 2013\u2014and completed my second 6-treatment session of Carboplatin/Taxol on September 25, 2015.   So keep the faith\u2014there can still be a good quality of life after CRS and chemo, even if \u201cfatigue\u201d is your companion!   Love Loretta  Peritoneal Carcinomatosis/Ovarian Cancer Stage IV  ",
