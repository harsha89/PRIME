      "Content": "I have a friend that started xeloda about four months ago. She has bone mets. So far things are looking good. The hot spots that she has are getting smaller, and there haven't been any new spots. The side effects are not as bad as chemo. She is also getting a little more of her energy back. I asked her if there is a limit to how long she can take it, and she said for as long as she needs too. That's all I really know. loulou",
