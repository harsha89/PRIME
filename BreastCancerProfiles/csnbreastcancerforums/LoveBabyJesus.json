      "Content": "Hi -- I am one who loves my organs and wanted to share this with you. We get caught up in beating this beast up that we forget about our organs - sometimes. Well, I just want to say that remember to drink A LOT of water as these drugs are very hard on our organs and they too deserve caring. Our Oncologists forget about them and gives us all kinds of drugs to be comfortable with treatments and emotions, but remember we have a big team in our bodies - our organs. Not only the drugs are doing the job, but also them. So if we can tolerate some side effects, let's help our organs and deal with them (especially for liver and kidneys). Let's also eat the right healthy things to help them process less things. Though we want this beast OUT of here, we also want to keep our organs happy and healthy. Just wanted to share with all of you.",

Do you know if the statistics for getting gynecologic cancers - such as uterine- have been recorded to specify timing? For examples, are the risks higher while taking this pill or years after done with treatment? Are there more cases recorded for women years after they're finished with the pills or during? Has there been any recordings of such data? Thank you all. Hugs",

I needed to get away from all of this, and work, and stress, and just enjoy myself. And I did. I thank God for this gift. Went for my checkup (markers) and got a 15. Not sure what this means, but its within the \"normal\" range. So I take it! So I am on a break until Oct. when I go for my mammo. I hope you are all doing well. I will check the most recent posts to catch up. In the meantime, how are my beautiful pink sisters (and brothers) doing? Hugs and a big kiss to all of you! <3",

I was dx at 32 last year and had a lumpectomy. I'm not the same because I always worry about getting new lumps. If I was well educated (and less nervous) about my diagnosis, I would have probably had a mastectomy. But I was scared. Plus I needed to start chemo right away, since I needed additional time to harvest my eggs. I guess it was the right decision at the time. However, if I'm faced with this again (and I pray I never will), I may remove them. This is a very personal decision though. Lynn gave you great advice! It is what feels right for YOU in your heart. I understand that surgery + radiation has the same results as the removal of the breast. Whatever you decide to do, I want to wish you good luck and I will pray that this is your LAST time dealing with this. Please keep us posted. We care.",

Doctors see a lot everyday so they are not always consistent with their behavior. They also worry our state of mind because they see everything. And sometimes patients are emotionally unbalanced because of the diagnosis, treatments, etc. I believe it is your right as a patient to know everything that's going on with you. Doctors can't keep anything from you. So if he had something important to tell you, I think he would. Perhaps he knows since you're going through this again, you need the support, and more so than before. He can't guess what you're thinking, but after all, he sees everything. I also suggest you tell him how you feel. Just be open and ask questions. I hope you feel better.",

Yet, it is so difficult to stay positive sometimes. How I wish he can talk to us like he used to talk to Moses and others. It would be nice to hear his voice and tell us that everything will be OK. And I do believe that everything will be OK for the simple fact that I know things happen for a reason, and he has a Plan. But it is difficult to understand that plan. What I keep telling myself is that yes, I have this, but I don\u2019t know when and how I will leave this earth! Also, everyone is mortal. I also ask myself, what am I really scared/sad about? Is it dying? Is it because I hate cancer with all my passion? Is it because I am too young? But then there is always a story of someone who has gone through worse and this is when I realize that I am lucky, after all. (Why not me?) That\u2019s why we are all here, for support and caring. We can also relate and understand what we are going through. It\u2019s tough! But, maybe this means we are tough too? Like people say, God doesn\u2019t give us a cross we cannot carry. And this one is a heavy cross, but we are still here. Living each day gratefully. I pray we all get the strength to overcome this, not only physically, but also mentally. With God\u2019s help.",

As you go through each process you will see how the fear of the unknown was bigger than the actual experience. You'll also notice how fast the process will go. And most importantly, you will recover. When I feel anxious I pray. It is important to have faith when going through this process, and to always remember you are not alone. We are here to listen, and we care. This is the right place. You will find understanding and support here. We can relate so we understand. Please let us know as you go through each step.

Of course, we\u2019re happy to know you\u2019re trying your best and that your dad is recovering. I am sorry things have been challenging and slow for you. I honestly don\u2019t know how you can try to do it all! I have some thoughts to share - I think you need a break to concentrate on your health. I have no doubts you can do it all, because you have been doing it all. But at some point the body will need extra rest because it has been through so much. I know it helps you mentally to live a normal life, and I am all for it. But your recovery and physical strength comes first. Please, if you can, try to give yourself a break. You can still go out, hang out with friends, go for walks, exercise, etc..but if I were you, I would take some time off to myself. Of course you do what\u2019s best for you and I am sure you have put things into perspective. But remember to be good to your body when it needs the help. School, jobs and friends will always be there. About your roommate, I agree with some of our sisters. This is a huge thing \u2013 although we have been through it already, and are now familiar with it, and perhaps we don\u2019t see it that way anymore\u2026but the truth is, it is. Not everyone is prepared to deal with this, especially someone who is not your family. It can be disappointing to see a \u201cfriend\u2019s reaction\u201d like the one you had. Of course it would bother me too. But unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t always turn out the way we wish it would. And this is the kind of situation that only a family could understand and have no regrets helping out (sometimes\u2026). You keep on doing your thing! I think you have a great support system so you don\u2019t need anyone to tell you anything that might hurt your feelings. You are above all of this. Just focus on your recovery and keep those who love you and care close to you. Glad to know you are back! XOXO",

My job was to help identify tables that were bidding. There were a few celebrities, like Kim Kardashian, Naomi Campball, among others. It was a gala event so it was fancy! I had fun. They raised 3.3 million dollars for cancer research and the money will go to Memorial Sloan-Kettering, my hospital. I was excited when I saw how many people donated their money for this - I know they're rich, but they could have used up their money for something else. I still think we need more support and we definitely need money to go to the right places. Gabrielle was a young women (26) who died from leukemia 15 years ago. And her last wish was to celebrate life. To read more about this go here: http://www.gabriellesangels.org/ For a video of the event go here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CJlrCm7v9Q I got to walk away with a nice gift bag with tons of products in it.

They will keep checking them for you and sooner than you think, those will be gone as well. I hope you\u2019re feeling better and your fever is gone. When I had my surgery my blood pressure was really down. And it has stayed low since (I had my surgery in Feb.). Don\u2019t worry about that too much \u2013 it should either go back to normal or that will be your new normal. Just happy that surgery is behind you. One step at a time. And remember, we\u2019re always here. Hugs!",
