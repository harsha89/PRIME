    "Content": "Hi, I had bc 10 years ago. I was 31. I had a 2cm tumor. Out of 12 lymph nodes, one was positive. I had my right breast removed on September 8th, 1999 and chemo started on October 25th. Under my arms was tender for a few weeks. I was very scared, but it does get better. Try not to think about all the chemo treatments all at onnce. Take each treatment separately. I know it is hard right now, your on a roller coaster of emotions. Take each day, one day at a time. You WILL get through this. Try to be positive and Try to be thankful that your breast cancer was found. Each day you have is a gift. :-). I only had one breast removed, I wear a fake \"boob\" and no one can tell. I can't advise you on having both removed or not. My suggestion is to talke to your doctor and get their thoughts. I only had one breast removed beacuse I hated surgery, and the side effects. There is Life After Going Through Breast Cancer.",
