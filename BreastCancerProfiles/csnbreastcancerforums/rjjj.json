But on the other hand it brings her own story to the media and not all of the other bad stuff that the National enquire etc. printed about it. And made others aware of the cruelty of the beast. As Re stated though..this is not our journey and we need not dwell on it. Yes its the scariest thing we will ever do. But we have come so far with new treatments..and have so many survivors to look up to. I am going to try to distract myself by doing fun things that i enjoy. I just hate that little nagging voice in the back of my mind, I hope it gets better with time. my best to you Jackie",

It is an anti-depressant, the DR. as i remember said that by getting a good nights sleep (REM) depression is lifted considerably, plus it has the anti-depressant qualities for the brain. Like a sleeping pill and anti-depressant all in one. I remember i really liked it but thought it made me to sleepy (i didn't want to sleep back then,) so i switched to celexa (just an anti-depressant) Thank you Jeanne for the reminder. I am going to ask Dr. to switch me back. Hugs Jackie",

I also will be taking some kind not sure yet of estrogen blocker for 5 years. I guess sometimes i tend to dwell on the thought..already..of reoccurance. I think this is the cause of most of my depression. Hopefully when gardening time comes and spring..i will be feeling better about things. I need to find the joy in life again. I know i can do it. I know you can too. You and Joe are taking positive steps for a long life together..I am so happy for that. hugs Jackie",

That is why like you i will do anything i can to reduce my chances of reocurance. I asked my Dr. about any clinical trials and they didn't know of any for my type of cancer. I also asked my surgeon at the last minute to take off both breast even though only my left had CA and they told me it was to late. And that we would keep a very close watch on the other breast. But i still wish i would have had a bilateral just to reduce chance of reocurance. You may need something to help you sleep as Moopy pointed out ativan and zanax is what they gave me. I only need the ativan for about the first week-10 days once in awhile. But my treatments are 3 weeks apart so i have that extra week to recoup. I will be praying for you that all tests come back good, and that you get the rest you need to fight and conquer! Hugs jackie",

My Dad had to work to pay the bills ( i guess that is understandable) but i was the one taking her to each apt. and her sole care giver, i informed the family of each new problem and tried to handle it all.. driving her when my tummy wouldn't even fit behind the steering wheel, I was 9 mo.'s pregnant with my son Jase. Anyway today my youngest sister called I have heard from her shortly once since I had my diagnosis. She carried on bitching about a fight that she had with her boyfriend/father to her child.. on and on.. Blah Blah Blah!! Not a question about me.. she is burned out at her job takiing care of old people (which I do as well) and can't take another demand (Blah Blah) She feels trapped in her life.. this is when i said I feel trapped too, and something is burning on the stove! gotta go. well my family NEVER calls me and expects that i will call them, They don't even know I am going to Rads or what that means.. I am very hurt and sick and tired of holding everyone up! Isn't it time they cared for me??? well they say you can pick your nose and pick your friends but you can't pick your family!!

We have been through so much together, and I am looking forward to many many more happy posts from you both. I bet it feels wonderful to be back home.

I love them all and hope and pray someday there will be a cure for both these deceases that steal so much from us. I know there is a special place in heaven for your mom. She is wrapped tight in the arms of the angels. It seems so cruel that you have to loose your hair at this time. But there will be regrowth and a renewal of spirit as well. Keep your chin up and you will see the sun coming at the end of the storm. It is very hard to be upbeat when life is beating you up. But you don't have to be upbeat when you don't feel like it. Take time to grieve. It's ok to cry and even to be angry. Like our other sisters on this board have said, be good to yourself. That's what your mom would have wanted. That is what we want also. We all are looking out for each other here, and that support has been invaluable to me ..as it will be for you. I am saying an extra prayer for you tonight. May God surround you in His love. Jackie",

What I'm trying to say is I know how you feel. It seems we will never get back to ourselves again. I toally agree with what all of our sisters have said. You are strong, intellegent, beautful, caring and have helped me so much since we found our way here to the boards. I know you will comeout of this funk even stronger and your desire for film-making will return. You have such a zest for life, and this will pass. I do agree with Judy also, The hormonal and vitamin deficiencies could be knocking usboth down. I know you will check with your Dr. for things to help this, as I will also. Maybe an injection of Vit. D to boost it right away? I am thinking of you and thanking you for being my friend always. Love, Jackie",
