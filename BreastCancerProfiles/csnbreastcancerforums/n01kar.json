      "Content": "I had a \"take it off party\" the saturday before my 1 st chemo session. My hairdresser came over to the house and gave me a \"g.i. jane haircut\". Now that i look back, i am glad that i did it before chemo. My hair started dropping about a week after my 1st session, by 2 wks, it was all gone. There are very few things that we have control over during our cancer battle , but in my eyes, i was going to control when/where i lost my hair. Like you, i also had taxotere and cytoxan. Its a personal decision, but if your hair is long, you might want to cut a couple of inches off, so its not too traumatic to see your hair on the ground. karlene",

      "Content": "The dreaded \"C\" word. A lot of people will tell you they can imagine what you are going through, but no, they cannot unless they have walked in your shoes. Every relationship in your life will be tested, whether it be with your spouse, friends, relgion and anything/everything you ever held sacred. But it will get better, you will meet a lot of \"angels\" during your journey. Take 1 day at a time , ask lots of questions even though it sounds stupid, be an informed patient and dont be backed into corner. You dont have to make any decisions immediately, it can wait until tomorrow and when in doubt, get a second opinion. As far as lumpectomy recovery time, 3 to 4 wks",
