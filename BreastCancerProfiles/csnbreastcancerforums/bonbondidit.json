      "Content": "Puffin, I am so very heartfeltedly sorry for your loss. I didn't know until today that this happened. I'm beside myself for you and what you have had to deal with lately. We both started our journey only a couple weeks apart from eachother and I always enjoyed when you talked about Lew and I remembered crying with love tears when he shaved your head for you. I thought what a couple, definetely for better or worse, in sickness and in health. My husband never commented on here but at times would ask me if Lew was doing anything that he may learn from and do for me. I believe my husband reallu looked up to him even though they never met. I have been helping my daughter with her new baby over the past two months and have been a bit out of touch. From what I just read he had an accident and I am amazed at the journey you have been dealt and are handling gracefully even though you may not think you are being graceful, you are! He just seemed like an amazing man and boooooooooy did he have your back and likewise.  You will always be the couple we as a couple look up to. He made an impression on my husband and I and for that I am so greatful! My mom lost her husband to cancer in January of this year and I have been watching her adjust after 30+ years of marriage to him. She is doing MUCH better now and has made peace with it all. She has started swimming again and now a group goes swimming with her at the nearby indoor pool. Getting out and enjoying people and company has won the race for her. I wish you all the healing the world and beyond has to offer.  FYI - you are also my organizational hero.  Man you really get things done! Gentle hugs, Bonnie",

      "Content": "I have to say that I haven't spoken of this here but one of my son's best friends who I was very maternal over helped my son dig the healing pond for me while I was going through treatments. He dug and laid rocks and helped mow the yard to make me smile. His name was Hermon. A few days after radiation, a few bad influences had apparently took their mom's car out over night and came by and convinced him to get in (6am.) We dropped him off at his house around 11pm the night before. They lost control of the SUV and rolled. Hermon was ejected and killed instantly. He was asleep in the back seat and never knew what happened. He was 13!  I never could have imagined HE would die before me - sigh. I love my pond, he helped build it for me and to know his hands personally placed those rocks where they are along with my family's hands does help me. After the funeral I asked for his mom Sharon to come see what her son helped build, he said it was a healing pond.  I couldn't believe it when she came, I took her back there and her face lit up in a happy way plus greatful tears. I feel like she could feel his presence there. His hands were on those rocks and she was very impressed! She worked a lot of hours and he was home alot so we had him over at our house many times to keep an eye on him. Anyways it was and is hard. Make the most of everything. It's a struggle to regain your legs after a traumatic event, but it is totally doable.  My mom and her husband had two weeks of knowing he was stage 4 at diagnoses. He had blood cancer and was 87. He chose not to treat and died two weeks later in their home, in their bed.  She lives alone in Oregon but her best friend is around the corner from her. They do everything now. Galavant is their middle name. I'm quite certain they have gone to every different restaurant on the Oregon coast. My mom has filed taxes (never did in her life before) handled the 401k like a boxing champ and mowed her grass to perfection.  She is finally happy again and you can see her coloring come back and looking healthy again.  I wish this for you - you will get there ;) About your sickness - sounds to me like you are not doing well with sweet things. Fruits, gaterades. This may sound strange but I think you should go to your closest good mexican restaurant and order Caldo. Beef if they ask. Looks prehistoric but honestly cures anything. Small sips of the broth and tid bid bites here and there saved my life many times.  Also you may do the concauction of pepto/mylanta cocktail. You don't need much for it to start working.  I hope you feel much better soon.",

      "Content": "Goodness that would be a drastic changefor sure!  I LOVE my breast reduction. I miss my nipple area for the look of them and miss those sensations but the flip side is I LOVE not having the back ache and going braless. My left side is a tad bit smaller than my right but not by much at all. My left side was a  radical removal whereas the other side was a profalactic approach yet both were done with the skin sparing technique.  I actually thought about putting a couple little flower pasties on them to see how my mood would feel looking at my body :)  At this point I'm just rediscovering myself for what and who I am today. It can be a bit fun when I allow myself to feel joy again :) I can wear shirts that I could never get away with before. I was always stared at no matter what I was wearing. It's not that that's a bad thing but it made me stand out from the crowd and I didn't always need to have that attention. I just wanted to wear cute sun dresses. When I would wear them though, it looked like I was just showing off the girls. To each there own :)",

It wrapped from my left breast area under my armpit and down in inside of my arm to my elbow. My chest wall took a long time to stop being sore. I would say at three months it started getting much better.  August 5th will be my one year BMX anniversary.  DO you get it all the time or when you move?",

      "Content": "I don't know about you but my chest wall or pecks where quite sore and darkened for a while. It looked very dark and I thought they would stay that way. I am happy to say that I have zero discoloration now on my peck muscles. Getting used to washing my hands and seeing the muscles move reminds me of when weight lifters move their pecks to show off. lolol. I had to get used to that for sure. Your upper body , chest area will change over the next year in shape and color. My breasts now (I calls them breasts still because they still look like small breasts to me, I had the skin sparing BMX) look way better, the scars look way better. I did not have reconstruction. I'll do that later down the road. I am very happy I made that desicion because I developed a small lump in my chest that wasn't cancerous but was removed about a week after chemo was done and it got infection. That travelled to my scar area on right side breast and turned into three abcesses that had to get packed for 4 weeks. Had I had the reconstruction it could have gone horribly wrong.  They warned me about this and I'm SOOOOOOOOO thankful I listened! Others have had zero trouble with their reconstruction so it was a \"me\" thing but it was a THANK GOD moment. It could have seriously compromised my reconstruction tissue had I had reconstruction after mastectomy.",
