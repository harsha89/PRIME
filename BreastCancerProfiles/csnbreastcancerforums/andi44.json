      "Content": "Wondering if any of you lovely ladies have had/heard of others having breast cancer in the opposite breast? I had a left breast mastectomy 2 years ago, and a nightmare of surgeries trying to reconstruct that side...Now, I get hit with the possibility of this on my right side...I am scheduled for a mammogram and ultrasound on Monday (4/27) to check what my doctor felt today...I\u2019ve had a chronic cough that the doctors can\u2019t figure out...and, for about a week now I have had pain on the right side \u2013 it hurts every time I cough, sneeze or laugh - thus my visit to the doctor for the umpteenth time...I wasn\u2019t expecting news about a lump on the breast.  Anyway, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to come back as a cyst or something\u2026But, was just wondering if anybody had any news of cancer on the opposite side - and if it hits even harder than before... Thank you for listening, Andi :)",

I thought, wonderful - I won't have to go thru radiation...wrong!!!...2 surgeries later, the doctor still couldn't 'clear margins'. Therefore, I ended up needing radiation......Today was a bit 'bitter sweet'...I've gotten to know the nurses & rad techs - and now I won't see them except for the doctor's appts...Anyway, cheers to me. (holding up a fake glass of wine  )...Though I haven't posted much, these discussion boards have been a great place to go since you all know how I feel and what I was going thru...It has been a great help...So, thank you all so very much - you lovely ladies out there...Cheers to all of us!!!
