I put the name I use here on these boards in the \"search\" box on facebook and at the bottom of the search results it showed links to these discussion boards with thngs I had written in the past about my lymphedema and breast swelling. To say the least, it was unsettling... since what I openly discuss here on these boards is not what I would so freely disclose to my coworkers, acquintances and neighbors. Has anyone else tried this on Facebook and found the same thing? Since my user names are similar on these boards, I guess it is possible that someone could make the connection. Thought I'd just let everyone know about my finding. It won't stop me from posting but I will be more mindful of what I will wtite. In hind sight, it would have been better to pick two totally differ names for Facebook and these boards. K",

Just need to acknowledge the past: loss, pain and suffering, stay in the moment ( We are now cancer free) and find something to make ourselves feel better (ex: lunch or dinner with friends, a movie, fun with the family or helping others). My one year anniversary comes early in the New Year. I don't plan to commemorate it however I will probably become \"aware of it\" as the day arrives. I have done this with anniversary dates of my best friend's death and those of my parents. Hang in there and enjoy life in the moment. Hugs, K",

The only other SE I have experienced is some blurred vision from dry eye that is now under control since beginning the OTC, Genteal lubricant drops once or twice a day.I have maintained my active lifestyle-lots of walking and working long hours (full time). If you have questions, call your Med Onc's office. You don't have to wait until your next appointment. I am told that there are supplements that can help with the joint pain and stiffness. It was recommended that I do daily walking for at least half hour perods (I normally do much more than this.)My nutritionist also suggested I start the vitamin B100s the week I started the Arimidex.

My Med onc mentioned this as a possibilty when she first spoke to me about the Arimidex saying that at this time, the research suggests five years although future investigations may support a longer course of this treatment to decrease the likelihood of the estrogen positive cancers from returning. As to your question about the rate of reoccurrence in those taking the hormone receptor blockers, I wonder how many of those reporting reoccurrences are really reoccurrence of the same cancer or a new cancer occurrence.

We ended up taking the shorter walking course for \"Survivors\" because my husband's hip was bothering him with the damp and wet weather we had that morning.I was a little disappointed that I did not get to walk the full course, as I have done in the past, before my diagnosis. I decided not to let this disappointment interfere with my enjoyment of the experience. The sun came out and the \"Survivor parade\" and \"Survivor Group Photos\" were powerful, emotional experiences. The size of the group was huge. Dr Oz made a lovely and inspirational presentation about the growing number of survivors and the improvement in early diagnosis and treatment over the last twenty years.He of course stressed the need for research to cure the beast. Afterward, we went out to a great place for brunch where we were treated with lots of special attention and care by the staff who recognized my team cap (the hospital where I work and receive my treatment) and the very obvious \"Survivor\" label on the crown. The best part of the day was the satisfaction that I acheived my donation goal and was able to \"give back\" to others who are currently receiving treatment and those yet to be diagnosed and treated, not only by walking to increase BC awareness but by my involvement in Komen sponsered research on quality of life in BC Survivors. Hope to post some pictures by the end of the week when I get time after work. Hugs, K",

I was offered the standard treatment of approximately six weeks of radiation or the more intense 21 day schedule with boosters. I believe that the shorter, more intense course of treatment is done more often in Canada, some Brazil and Europe. This shorter course of treatment has become standard practice in several countries. Several Cancer centers here in NYC have been offering it for more than 10 years. I checked the research and the results appear about the same as the longer course in regard to prognosis and side effects.Speak to your Oncologist about it. Differences in machines, your doctor's clinical judgement and the facility's protocols will also influence what choices are available in regard radiation treatments. Hang in there. All the best.
