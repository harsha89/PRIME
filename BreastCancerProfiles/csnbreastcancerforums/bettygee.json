    "Content": "I know you are absolutely NOT a rotten mother, you have raised two sons while fighting your own battle against cancer. I think you are a very brave person. I hope you will not be offended if I ask if your son who is clinically depressed and on medication is receiving ongoing counseling for his depression. If he still talks of suicide after being on medication, he may need a different medication, there are so many available and some work better for some people and others for other people. I am not a mental health professional, just another person who has been extremely depressed and had to try several different prescriptions before my doctor found the right one to keep me stable. I am so grateful she did not give up until we found the right one for me. Love and best wishes for you and your lovely family. Betty",
