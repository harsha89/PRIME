I did 6 rounds of chemo before my surgery.. no radiation. I am sorry you have to deal with this, but this a great group to be a part of, you will get more info here than other place! Good luck, prayers and positive thoughts for you. Sandy",

I had a bi lateral mastectomy and did not have too much pain other than trying to get out of a chair or off the potty.. no constant pain. I think you check with him/her about this. I am sorry I can not answer your questions, but again get this information from your doctor.. if they say no, ask why no follow up treatment..be satisfied with ALL your answers before you leave the office. Good luck. I hope you start to feel better soon. Sandy",

If friends and family want to visit tell them great come on over and see me for an hour. After the hour is up just tell them you need to rest. If anyone doesn't like the dog toys maybe they will offer to clean. As far as not wanting to head back to treatment, I remember that well! Push through, you can do it!

      "Content": "Tina, I will be getting nipples at the time I do my exchange. Talk to your plastic surg. and see what can be done. I think for me the way I got past the ugly was to see the beauty. The beauty is that this surgery can now be done leaving minimal scarring. Years ago, women were not as fortunate as we are to have the options we do. I also look at my scars as my battle scars, and I won the battle. I will live to see grandchild #5 born next month and hopefully more will follow. I hope to live to see grandchild 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 get married! I fought hard to be able to do that. I wanted to do everything possible to assure I did everything to get rid of my cancer. Talk with your surgeon about your fears. Is their a specific reason you are afraid you won't wake up? I had one surgery before this and that was to have my tubes tied 22 years ago LOL.. I was a little apprehensive but both my surgeons were so helpful I was totally relaxed when we got in the OR. Most of the time our fear of the unknown is much worse than what actually takes place. Have you viewed medical pictures of people who have had bi lateral Mastectomy? I will be happy to answer any other questions you have.. just PM me! {{{Hugs}}} Sandy",

I have scoliosis so my PS is making it so if you look at me my breats appear even. If I look down..whoa what a difference! I am just trusting he will know what he is doing! I am sorry you feel so poorly about your self right now. I know I cried the first time I got out of the shower after my bi lateral and saw my stitches, the drains hanging out, the horrid bruising. My hubby saw me crying and asked what was wrong and when I told him I looked like some kind of monster (I am overweight ss well) he wrapped me in his arms and held me and told me it was all going to be ok. He didn't think I looked like a monster, he said he had a hard time looking because it made him hurt so much that he could not take away my pains. Of course he was the one to take care of my incisions etc. and I soon accepted that I didn't care what I looked like. I am thankful to be here, to have him and my children and grandkids. I pray I never have to experience this again. I know your flap surgery is much more invasive than what I went through. Please talk to a professional about your feelings, whether it be your surgeon or a counselor. If you need anti depressants don't hesitate to take them! You have been through somuch!Talk to your husband.. I just bet he thinks your more beautiful now than before. Prayers and positive thoughts for you! Sandy",
