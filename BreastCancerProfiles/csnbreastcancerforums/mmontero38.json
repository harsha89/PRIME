I also take a multi-vitamin every day and my calcium. I exercise 6 days a week now and do some weight lifting for strength. You're mediterranean and so am I so following that diet should not be difficult and we reap many benefits from it. The article meant to say that we shouldn't replace with a pill the benefits of eating the actual vegetable or fruit which is the natural source of the vitamin. You are doing the right thing by eating healthy and once you are done with ytour treatments and start feeling better, you'll have more energy to do some excercise. Hugs, Lili",

I was also diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in June, 2007. My tumor was a Grade 3 which makes it very aggressive and luckily I had clean lymph nodes.

I haven't had my ovaries or fallopian tubes removed but going through chemo made me go into menopause overnight. I am also on Tamoxifen for the next 5 years which causes other problems. I have experienced hot flashes sometimes a little on the extreme whereby I am drenched and the operative word here is DRENCHED in sweat. The symptoms were worse in the beginning and it happened more often and now I don't have flashes as often. I know it will be hard for you but you need to realize that if having the hysterectomy improves your chances of living longer than go for it. You have that precious little girl to live a long life for. When I did my reconstruction, I did the tram flap which means you are cut from hip to hip. I will not lie to you and say it was easy. The first 2 weeks were rough but it got easier after that. Did the ob say if you could qualify for a laproscopic procedure or do they have to cut you open? It's a hard decision, but it will improve your chances. Wishing you all the best, Hugs, Lili",

If you do desk work buy a jug of lysol wipes and wipe every surface down everyday. Especially the telephone and keyboard if you use a computer. Your first week after treatment try not to get to close to outsiders and avoid crowded places such as movies and malls. I use to go very early to get my shopping done so that I wouldn't be exposed to many people. I didn't need to have radiation since I had a mastectomy but I was told you get very tired about half way through. Schedule the radiation for the end of the day and not in the morning, if you do get tired you are going straight home after that and into bed. Good luck to you and keep us posted as to your progress.

I know he's done miracles because I was totally concave when we started out and that's why I went for the tram. The breast surgeon had removed way too much muscle and there was hardly any there to hold up an implant. I don't know yet if I will do it. I guess I just don't want to face more surgery unless absolutely necessary. There have been too many procedures since June 2007 when I was dx and had the mastectomy. I think that right now I'm asking for peace of mind and I think it will come soon. Thank you for your kind words. Wishing you a happy and peaceful new year also. Hugs, Lili PS> And yes each day that passes is better than the day before. Thank you Cathy.",

I'm happy with my results for the most part except for an indentation above the breast which the doctor has filled in with fat. This last procedure was the tattooing of the aerola and to fill in that indentation again. I like you was just a little disappointed that there is still an indentation there so when I went for the post op even the surgeon said we need to fill in again. I guess my disappointment was the fact that I wanted everything finished with since it's been 1 1/2 years already since I started this journey I never wanted to embark in and I didn't want to start off the New Year facing another surgery. But, it wasn't in the cards and I will once again have to go in for one more procedure. I am hoping to be done by March 2009. The important thing for me was getting some semblance of normalcy, which I have accomplished. I hope you are doing well also. May 2009 bring you health and peace. Hugs, Lili",

I was given 8 rounds of cytoxan, adriamycin, and 5FU. Now, that I look back, I don't recall reading anyone being on these meds for so long, and maybe that's why I got so sick towards the end. Maybe 8 rounds was way too much. I don't know, all I can say is I'm glad it's over. Just ask your doctor for nausea meds before you start your treatment and take it before you go for your infusion. Better safe than sorry because if you do get sick, then it's hard to get a handle on it and no matter what you'll take you will be nauseas. Good luck and hugs, Lili",

They cut out a flap and then use microsurgery to reattach the flap. This procedure can take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours in the or. Tram uses the muscle and the flap is tunneled through inside your body up to the chest area. That's the surgery I had. I was in the or for 5 1/2 hours. I was very happy with the result. I then went back in August to do the nipple reconstruction, and I will now be going in on Dec 17th to tattoo the aureola and to do some fat injections in the upper chest area since it still is a little concave.

The incision goes from hip bone to hip bone but low right above the pelvic bone. I don't feel I have too much scar tissue because my surgeon had me massaging both my stomach and breast about 4 weeks after the surgery so that the scar tissue wouldn't form. My breast is as soft as my other one (I only had the right side) but honestly, I don't have much feeling there. When I was looking for a plastic surgeon, I actually went to 5 different doctors until I found this one. They all recommended the silicone gel, I just preferred to have the tram done instead. If you were to choose the silicone gel, how much would you have to pay out of pocket? It might be worth looking into. You have to do what will work best for you Cathy. Personally, I think either one would look good. Today the doctors are great at reconstruction. Hugs, Lili",

The nurse at the hosp, taught me how to drain the tubes and luckily had them removed 1 week later. I went through 8 rounds of adriamycin/cytoxan and finished chemo in NOvember. They removed 7 lymph nodes and all were negative so I didn't need to have radiation. I didn't do my reconstruction right away. I waited until this past February to have it done and decided to do the tram flap. I am very happy with my decision and will be going back in August to finish the reconstruction.
