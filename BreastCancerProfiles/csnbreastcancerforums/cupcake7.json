      "Content": "Hi Girly Girl: No you won't feel anything, they will go slow to make sure you are doing ok. If you do have a problem, most don't, then they are right there to make it right. Yes I have a port and posted a picture because someone else ask me. If you are not having a large round, I had 6 months of chemo, you probably won't need one. I'm sorry if I come on first time out the gate, but I wear my heart on my sleeve and jump right in. I remember well how scared I was and after made a promise that if I saw anyone going through that I would reach out to help them not be so afraid. I spent two years at breastcancer.org web sight and it was a lifesaver for me. You will most likely have some meds in the form of steroids. This helps you fight off the results of the chemo for a couple of days, then, for most, the third day you will not feel so well. Be prepared for that. Drink lots of water before hand, but eat a light meal before, nothing sweet, greasy or spicy. The first few times your ONC will see how you are doing and adjust the chemo for you. If you get sick let them know and they can change your medicine. Some swears by zofran, but didn't do anything for me but when I got on Amend it made all the difference and never got sick again for six months. Nausea that is. Tired, yes very much so, but you will begin to see a pattern and you will feel better everyday. Just about the time you are feeling good they hit you again and you begin the same routine. Everyone is different but you will see your pattern. The worst is the unknown, after a few times you will be in here helping some newbie scared to death.",

      "Content": "Hi girly girl: Just joined and your my first contact. I am a veteran chemo taker and my first advice is to take a deep breath and relax. Grab a cup of coco or coffee cause you and I are going to become good friends. I remember my first and I was scared to death too. I thought I would start throwing up in the chair...I didn't know....It is a breeze it really is...day 3 now is a different story but you will be home and can deal with it. I will walk you through if you want. First day you will be at wonder...maybe take someone with you to share the experience. Later take a portable DVD player so you can watch movies or a good book if you like to read. Good time to catch up on a letter if you still write.",
