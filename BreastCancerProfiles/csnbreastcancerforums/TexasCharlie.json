      "Content": "Hi all;  I am very curious if there are any out there who suffer or have suffered from neuropathy in your hands and if you were successful to ANY extent in dealing with it. Medications, excercise, diet, whatever worked, if even just a little. I REALLY want to get the feeling back in my left hand so I can play guitar again. Playing has been a large part of my life since I was 15 and since my left hand has gone about 70% numb there is a huge empty spot where music had been.   I am dealing with it but want to become more pro-active and see if I can bring it back. Any help or advice would be well appreciated. Thank You Charlie",

      "Content": "believe it or not Eleanor I feel for you. For me it wasn't the hair on my head so much as the facial hair. I had hidden a scar on my upper lip all my adult life with a mustache and I had had a goatee for over 20 years. It was all a shock and I cried in private as I have done many times since the beast started changing my life. After all, I am a man and accepting this breast cancer and the treatments hasn't been real easy from my point of view. Ultimately, my trust is in God and His plan for me. Yes, God IS great!",

      "Content": "O.K. So I was so excited over being able to taste I failed to remember to mention something that is important to me. I first knew something was wrong with my body when the cancer expressed itself through my nipple. Being the ignorant male that I am, I let it go until the nipple started bleeding and wouldn't stop. It was at that point that my wife delivered the ultimatum that I go see a doctor. I had dealt with this bleeding for many months and into the chemo. Yesyerday was the 1st day in I don't know how long I have gone all day without a bandage. It healed! That is how I know the chemo is working. The tissue around it is nice and soft too. Too bad I'll lose it anyway. But that's the price we pay to exorcise this Beast.",
