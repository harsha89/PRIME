      "Content": "In regards to having lumpy breasts...I always recommend to young women that if they don't understand what they are looking for, ask your doctor to go over it with you...DEMAND your doctor to go over it with you. I never did self exams but I accidentally (although I don't believe anything is an accident) found the lump (lymph node) under my arm. When I initially went to the doctor to have it looked at, he asked if I did self exams and I said no and that I was never sure what I was looking for. I will always remember what he said to me, \"It seems pretty obvious now, huh?\" And it was! If you get to know your breasts and all of their lumps and bumps, you'll notice changes and that's what it's about. I too have a ton of cancer in my family...and my mom's sister died of BC and they told me 40, 40, 40. If I had one earlier, it may not have been so advanced!",

I quit about a week before my mammogram because I had this weird feeling I had lung cancer...as it turns out it wasn't my lungs. BUT, the week leading up to the day I quit, they just weren't tasting the same to me, so I just stopped. For me I never looked back but I had quit in the past and gone back and craved and all of that. This time for some reason I had none of that. Fast forward to a few months ago. My husband chewed snuff...he quit with Chantix. He says that he still has cravings...not as badly though (but he also stopped taking it a few weeks after he quit.) I hope you are having lots of success...I love that your husband is supportive...I should have been more so when mine was quitting chewing. Gum, walks, etc. Somebody (I hope this wasn't mentioned...I didn't read very thoroughly) told me to put a paperclip in your pocket and to pull it out and play with it when you want to smoke. It's a good \"occupy the hands\" thing. Yea for the first week!!!",

I would certainly think that 17 years would make you a little more grateful. None of my family members got that much time. I will remain positive...even though you think I'm upset.
