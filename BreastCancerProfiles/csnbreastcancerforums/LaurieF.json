    "Content": "I do not have diabetes, but I have some experience with the stresses of what you are encountering. Stress in and of itself will drive up your blood sugars. I started checking my blood sugars four times a day before my last breast reconstruction surgery and noted a distinct difference in the elevation of my normal levels. There are also drug to drug reactions that can occur, also driving up your blood sugars. You may find that you will only have to use insulin during your chemo. and then when things calm down again your levels will likely return to their previous levels. In any event keep your oncologist and primary doctor involved in your diabetes. Check blood sugars often. Best wishes.",
