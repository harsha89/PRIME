    "Content": "This is the scariest thing ever. I first started seeing stars, and I was able to tell my husband something was wrong. Then I sat up and felt my back spasm and my throat close up. I had cheese its in my mouth and knew I had to spit those out. I had a sense of impending doom because of my throat closing up. My husband got help fast and they gave me benedryl and steroids. You can't help but feel anxious after something like this. They restarted the taxotere at a slower rate. I will get premedicated with benedryl and steroids for the next time I get chemo. Knowing that this might happen again scares me.",
