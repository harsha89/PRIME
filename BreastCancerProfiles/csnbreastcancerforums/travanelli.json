      "Content": "Hi just had my laparascopic hysterectomy 6 weeks ago and it's going great. Tamoxifen increases uterus activity and causes the heavy bleeding...I had the same problem. My cancer was estrogen positive so I needed the ovaries out as part of my cancer treatment. I did get Lupron shots to ease the heavy bleeding and was fine with than...glad to be able to leave the house. My surgeon who is on the board of ACS suggested having the uterus removed if I was having the ovaries out because of the complications from Tamoxifen. Healing was easy and had no pain. Glad I did it. Good luck with your decision.",
