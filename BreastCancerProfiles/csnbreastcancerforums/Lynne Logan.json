    "Content": "I had a port for my first cancer and hated it!!! It was directly below my collarbone and when I used my arm I'd get pain that radiated into my shoulder. I think it just rubbed. To add insult to injury I developed an embolism during the removal and was rushed by ambulance to the ER. I have been diagnosed with a new breast cancer and after mastectomy will once again go through the chemo/rads. I was dead set against another port until I researched. The port is probably the wisest choice. I talked to my surgeon and he promised to put it far enough below my collar bone so I'd have no trouble. That was supposed to happen this morning except the OR's imaging machine went on the fritz so I'm in a holding pattern right now. The PICC does require help (a third hand) and maintenance. Best to you with your treatment, Lynne",
