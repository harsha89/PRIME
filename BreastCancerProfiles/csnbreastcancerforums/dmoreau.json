    "Content": "I have had implants after tissue expander reconstruction - bilateral. I am experiencing horrible muscle tightnes and \"knots\" or trigger points throughout shoulder, neck, arm and chest areas. The pain can become intolerable. I have sought relief through phyysical therapy, massage, chiropractic, accupuncture and pain management without much relief. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Does anyone have any other ideas for relief? (such as removal of the implants). I need help, this has been going on for over a year.",
