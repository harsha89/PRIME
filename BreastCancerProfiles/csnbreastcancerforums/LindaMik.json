    "Content": "Kerri has just had a mastectomy. The tumor was ductal, about 1.5 centimeters. We opted for mastectomy instead of lumpectomy because Kerri had an aneurysm 8 years ago and had dementia, we all felt she would not lay still for the radiation. The doctors thought it would be too dangerous. They removed the tumor and 10 lymph nodes, there was a \"little bit\" they said in one lymph node. Her2 is not present and it is an estrogen receptor. We have been given the choice of the hormone pill for 5 years or chemo. We are very concerned about how sick she will get but she wants every chance that she can get so it does not come back. Any suggestions, experience etc. will be appreciated.",
