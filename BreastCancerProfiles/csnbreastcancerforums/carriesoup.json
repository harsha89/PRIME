      "Content": "hello everyone! i just had my 6th taxol yesterday. i'm happy to say, that side effects for me have been very minimal. i hope it keeps on going this way. still have 6 more to go! finally felling like myself again now that the A/C is completely out of my system (haven't taken colace in 3 weeks!! lol) my hair is stubbly, food tastes fine, bowels are flowing and i have all my finger/toe nails! life is good! i've been posting on facebook a lot. we have a group on there as well. so if anyone is on facebook send a friend request to me and i'll add you! (carrie sue smurkowski) Happy Holidays!!! *hugs* carrie :)",

      "Content": "it's a scary thought! you never know how you're going to feel until it's done. after i had my lumpectomy this summer, i wondered if i did the right thing. i still look in the mirror and wonder if i did. should i have just gotten the mastectomy? i'm uneven now and my right side is quite a bit smaller than my left. and, that's just my own brain, because my boyfriend thinks i look fine. i don't know if any solution in the \"right\" one. our breasts make us womanly. it's hard not to want them around! IT DID TRY TO KILL YOU THOUGH! lol. ;) (how long do you have to wait for reconstruction after a mastectomy?) *hugs* carrie :)",
