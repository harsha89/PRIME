If I remember correctly the chair has a rounded bottom so you can swivel around easily. I forgot all about the chair until I found this picture but recall that I liked it a lot.",

Question: Any of you rad girls experience being nauseated and/or light headed from rad treatments. I'm not on any BC meds and not in chemo but I felt that way this morning. Not sure if I can blame it on rads or if I am coming down with something.",

I have natural auburn hair ... okay now it is natural gray but I still color it with over the counter products and get it as close as I can to my old auburn color which I only leave in for 20 minutes. When looking for this product is it in a box like the other hair colors or in a smaller package? Am I looking for a tube of powder? Thx for your help.",
