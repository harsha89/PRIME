Anyway, I'm glad you are doing well and totally agree with the snappy retort, however, I usually think of them after the fact, lol. Best Wishes.",

One guy said that I was a brave woman to be willing to be seen like that. (very short hair). He was speechless when one of my other customers told him I was braver than he knew, that I had just finished chemo. Only a few people knew as my wig was a good match for my pre chemo hair. In all fairness, he didn't know, but he's stilla jerk!!! I have heard him say ignorant things to others also. Sometimes you have to consider the source. Congrats on being able to go topless. It's a great feeling.",

      "Content": "My breast surgeon put the port in the day before I started chemo. It's quite easy and painless. Some people get the port in and go right to get chemo. No worries there. I had a breast exam and some blood work, but I saw the onc. even before my Onco score was back. The onc came in on my second visit and said, \" based on your onco score, you need chemo and your hair is going to fall out\". Short and sweet. She was very reassuring and explained everything about side effects and didn't steer me wrong. Everyone's experience is different but I'm sure you'll feel much better after it is over. My onco score was 22, and my onc requires everyone over 18 to get chemo. You will be fine, you have a great attitude. Best Wishes.",

I have been seeing med. onc. every three months and will have six month check with rads onc. My confusion is I was told in April that my blood work would be done by the breast center where I get my mammo and sent over. However, I have found that they don't do blood work. I called med onc office and they said, there is no order for blood work so I must not need it. Do you all think this could be tue? Does anyone still on 3 month checks with onc not get blood work? I, personally think this is a mix up. Can anyone enlighten me? Thank you.",
