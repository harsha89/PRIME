      "Content": "I regret to say that I spent most of last week needlessly worrying about my first chemo treatment. What would it be like? How would my body react? etc. The first thing that I found very helpful is that the oncologist prescribed something that I could take 1 hour before my treatment to help calm my nerves. I met with the oncologist who answered all of my questions and then gave me a blood test. I then went to the treatment center where their goal is to make you as comfortable as possible. The actual iv treatment took a while (but I am having 3 different medications for my chemo.) during that time I watched tv and ate snacks and talked to people. The atmoshpere was very relaxing and I was pleasantly surprised to find that all of the worry I did before hand was for not. Good luck!",
