    "Content": "Your oncologist will probably recommend chemo due to the fact the cancer was in lymph nodes. You will probably not have to have radiation due to mastectomy. I too am triple negative, stage II..not in lymph nodes. I am currently undergoing chemo adriamycin/cytoxin and will follow with taxol. If I choose to have mastectomy I can skip the radiation otherwise will follow chemo with 6-7 wks radiation. What my oncologist told me was....the reason for chemo is just in case in any cells did manage to get past the lymph nodes and implant somewhere else ...she also said in my case the reason for radiation is because with lumpectomy blood flow is interrupetd and the chemo can't get to that specific area. I will say that I \"interviewed\" more than one oncologist and they all had the same \"recipe\" and length of time for chemo. I too questioned why chemo with a good surgery....hope this helps. Good luck and God Bless! Ceanne",
