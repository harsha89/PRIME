      "Content": "It is hard for our families to hear us talk like that. Mine is the same way, they look at it as negitive. I look at it as realistic. For me just writing about my feelings and see it on the screen helps me so much. I have a friend I can talk openly with and she doesn't try to hush me up. Sometimes we need to get that off our chests. I wish you all the best. Marianne",

      "Content": "When my hair started coming out I went a week dealing with all the stands in my hair brush, on my shirts, on the floor, on my pillow and in the shower drain. It was so hard to deal with! Then I finally got the courage to have my husband shave it off. Then at least it was short hair all over rather than long hair! Losing my hair was probably the hardest part to deal with in this cancer fight. I don't know why, I thought I was so prepared for it. Now I love not having hair. Not getting in my face, don't have to worry about fixing it and so on. Just a couple of weeks ago I finally put away my curling iron. I went a month with it just sitting there on the counter. I have a couple of really nice wigs, in cute hair styles and I would rather just put on my hat and go. My husband says he isn't going to let me grow my hair back he loves it like this. I may just wear it short when it comes back. Believe it will be so nice to get that part over with, I wish I would of shaved it off sooner!",

I have weakness too. If something falls on the floor either I leave it or someone has to pick it up for me. Once I go down it is very hard for me to get back up. I am also so tired I sleep most of the day. I was hoping to go back to work now that I am starting radiation and thought I would be feeling better but I am feeling worse. I have joint pain too that is so bad at night I have to take pain pills to be able to fall asleep. I have been in contact with the onc regarding these symtoms and he has make some suggestions but they haven't helped! I have an appointment to see him on Monday and I have a list of questions for him! He too didn't give me a choice on taking it or not. He said I had to with my type of cancer. I am hoping we will be making some more changes next week at this appt I can't live like this for 5 years. I would rather not take it and take my chances. Marianne",
