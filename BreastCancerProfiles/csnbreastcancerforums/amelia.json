      "Content": "I devoloped frozen shoulder just before I discovered a lump n my breast a year ago. It came on very slowly at first. Like hummingbyrd said, it hurt like h*ll. When I would reach for something, especially to reach behind me, like getting my purse out of the back seat, the pain would take my breath away. The pain would start off slow and keep getting worse to the point I would have to hold my arm and my breath until it would slowly go away. Doc said therapy first. did that for three months with no improvment, so he operated and it unfroze it, but I'm still working on getting the strength back. It is important to keep it moving as best you can. It is also important to at least see a therapist to get proper intruction on how to move it. Good Luck, Amelia",

      "Content": "Jan, thank you so much for saying what I think we are all feeling, but not knowing how to say ourselves, (or too scared to admit). Takes a bit of weight off my shoulders. ;-) You mentioned you seek solice in nature. It works for me!! After chemo and radiation, the boyfriend and I took off in the fifth wheel, with my cats too, and traveled all across the whole U.S. I soaked my bald head in the steam from yellowstone, (which I am sure helped my hair grow faster), and hugged the huge Sequoia's in California (which gave up a small bit of thier energy to me) and also walked in the amazing church of God in the Redwoods at Cresant City, (it truly is a spiritual experiance) and inhaled the healing salt air of the Pacific. If any of you have not done these things, find a way. You will be amazed at the healing powers and the strength you will feel ( to body and soul) when you get home!! I am sure the Atlantic and area's of the East coast, or where-ever you are also have these same powers. So get out there in the sun and find them!! God Bless all, Amelia",
