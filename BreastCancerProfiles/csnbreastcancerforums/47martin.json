    "Content": "It is not at all painful to have the drainage tubes removed. I had 3 of them myself last June which were removed about a week after the surgery (modified radical mastectomy with reconstructive surgery). The doctor just said to take a deep breath and while I was concentrating on that he removed them. No pain! I didn't even need any Tylenol or any pain reliever. You'll do really good. 47martin",
