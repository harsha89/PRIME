    "Content": "I use www.cpmart.com and after mastectomy used the Reconstruction Recovery Camisole which worked perfectly. It comes with soft poly fill form that you can easily adjust to match the other breast. It was soft and made me not lop-sided all through the healing, during the drain tubes, and after chemo, I used it during radiation when the skin should not have anything tight on it. Now I wear a prosthesis and bras, also from that site. I would like to find a regular retail store that has camisoles or lots of bras that I could try on right there. With one real breast and one prosthesis, sometimes its hard to get a good fit. I travel to most major US cities so if anyone knows of a good store - please let me know.",
