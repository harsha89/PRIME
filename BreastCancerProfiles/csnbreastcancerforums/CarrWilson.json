      "Content": "Boy, I wonder if we went to the same MD??? Probably not, but my nurse coordinator was horrible. I totally loved the MD and he had a great reputation, but could not see myself going where she was for every appointment. She actually told me I could not make an appointment unless she went over my records to make sure I \"really\" had cancer and then she would have to OK it. I got a second opinion and felt very confident in the second MD. I am also a nurse and was shocked at how I was treated like a child. I know I was shaking and upset, but very accepting about my diagnosis. The way I was talked to was almost insulting. I received one of those survey questionnaires and did not hold back! I knew the MD personally and let him know how upset I was, and felt bad when he just said, \"yeah, I know\". Once you have someone in that position it is hard to get rid of them. How frustrating for all of the patients! I just wanted to say welcome to this group, you will find a lot of support. Don't feel bad about asking the ACS for help, and hopefully the phone support was helpful. We have to stick up for ourselves. This is our body, our decisions, and we have to go with whom we trust. Best of Luck with these tough decisions! - Carrie",

      "Content": "I thought Chemo was supposed to make you thin. I am constantly eating and when I am not eating, I am thinking about what the next meal or snack will be. I was told part of this is the steroids, part is the anxiety, part is loss of control of your life, and part dealing with your diagnosis. Right now everything tastes soooooo good. I also find myself craving food, especially sweets. I have gained about 10 pounds. It is such a bummer to have to deal with weight gain as well as cancer. Also, I have not been exercising as much as I used to. I know what I am supposed to do to lose weight, but I just can't make myself do it. I still have 3 more treatments, and I can't take another 30 pounds! I may have to post my weekly weigh in also! LOL. P.S. My hubby loves that I am baking and buying more goodies now.",

Some may have small areas of stainless steel or titanium in them. www.bardaccess.com/port-powerport There are multiple kinds, you need to check with your MD what kind you had put in. Glad you can wear you nametag on the right side! What the heck is a bakkugan? LOL - Carrie",
