      "Content": "My port was put in about a week before my first chemo. I don't really remember terrible pain but it was worse than the mastectomy because that area is still numb. Having lost 30 pounds I'm sort of skin and bones so my port really sticks out. (Nurses love it- no searching). Between chemo every 3rd week, herceptin every week, 25 transfusions of various types, and 2 seperate weeks in the hospital with constant IVs the Port has saved my life. Currently doing 4-6 weeks of daily IV Vancomycin along with Herceptin every 3rd week. They are keeping th port accessed for this daily routine. EMELA cream is great stuff too. It does get better as it goes along------ well actually I went up and down a lot---- but am through the worst of it. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Bill",
