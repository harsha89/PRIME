Being ER-, there is nothing for you to take.Don't worry about this at this point. Get thru the node biopsy and then see what the next plan of care will be. Good luck! I will be praying for you.

My nipple was made from tissue they removed from within the reconstructed breast(I'm not sure how they did it!) I had a hard dressing over the nipple for 1 week to protect it from any trauma,or pressure. I had a 2nd procedure to make the nipple smaller, then the tatoo to give it color and will have another procedure on Thurs. to fix the nipple. It is receding into the tissue so the definition isn't as good as it should. None of these procedures has caused any discomfort at all. Good luck. I'm sure you'll be happy with your final results.

I do get checked 2 x a year by my Gynocologist for uterine cancer via internal US. After 5 years I switched to femara for 8 mos then Aromasin for 1 1/2 years and that's another story! Good luck with the Tamoxifen. It's very doable! HUGS!! Cathy",

I think I would want to pursue it a bit beyond There's nothing to do. If the GYN agrees, then I would be a bit more comfortable but would keep a close watch on it. Good luck! Keep us informed about your decision and the end result! HUGS!! Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi Lili! I had my mastectomy and reconstruction 8 years ago. I had a tram flap so therefore, about 7 or 8 procedures. I had my nipple and areola reconstructed and then had my nipple fixed again as it flattened out. Guess what? It flattened out again. I had a dent above my new breast and had it injected with a filler which didn't work so I had a fat transfer from my posterior thigh. Guess what? I still have a dent. I decided it wasn't something I really needed to fix. It wasn't all that obvious to others as my clothing pretty much covered it up. Yes, when I wear my bathing suit it can be noticed but I decided I wasn't going to let this bother me. There are so many other things bigger than this to bother me at this point in life so I put it on the back burner. My husband never commented on it. My 23 yr old daughter noticed it for the first time over Christmas this year but that was ok. Would I like it to look like the other side? Of course,but I decided I had enough surgery and this was not a major health risk. Of course, you do what you feel is important to you. I just wanted you to know that I have a similiar problem but finally decided to stop trying to look perfect and just be happy with me.Good luck with whatever you decided. I'm sure you will be happy with your decision. HUGS!! Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi Gramma44! Why wait till Nov. to speak to your Onc. if you're so uncomfortable? Maybe he could suggest something to help ease the pain. There are so many good medications out there. I'm also concerned about the Femara. I will be starting it in a few days just finishing my 5 years of Tamoxifen. I can't really say that I've had a bad time on Tamoxifen other than the hot flashes and night sweats. I also have some joint pain in my hands , elbows and shoulders but have been on meds. for a week and notice alot of improvement. I was stage 0, Estrogen +, Mastectomy and Tram Flap Reconstruction. I am willing to try the meds to prevent recurrance but if the side effects are bad, I'll just have to hope I don't get the BC back. Hope you're feeling better. Let us know what the onc. says. HUGS!!

The only thing I really can't do is do a situp and I did notice I had a little trouble going backwards for an overhead shot. My balance was a little unsteady as I didn't have my abdominal muscles to stabilize me. You learn how to compensate for the muscle loss. One thing that is important is to be aware of your back. With weak stomach muscles comes a chance for back problems.I was terrified of the surgery but never once regretted it. Please feel free to e-mail me here and I will answer any questions I can help you with. HUGS!! Cathy",
