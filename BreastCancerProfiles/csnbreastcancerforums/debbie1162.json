      "Content": "I am a single parent with an autisic son. I did not think I could handle Chemo, being sick, losing my hair and the cost. BUT I HAD TO BE HERE FOR MY SONs. I have finished in June. I was sick about 10 days the whole 12 weeks and I did lose my hair. Now I have curly hair and have a payment plan with the hospital. So it was worth it. Trust yourself. But don't base your decision on money or hair. Good Luck with your decision.",
