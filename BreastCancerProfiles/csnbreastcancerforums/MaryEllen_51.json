    "Content": "I'm skeptical about the poster who is promoting \"hard money loans.\" I especially noted the link provided.....hmmmmmm. Bad advice if you ask for my humble opinion. Yikes! Employers who run credit checks do so when the position involves handling money as an indicator of future job performance - banking, retail, accounting, et al. There are also employers that run credit checks simply as part of their process to determine future job performance - organizational skills, detail, etc., if they have validated this process as a true indicator. Let's face it. People can say whatever they please about their skills, but it's not necessarily the case. That's why a credit check may also be used. However, if a candidate can show (which is near impossible) that discriminatory practices have taken place in the selection procedure (any part of it), then the candidate would have to take further action on their own. Most candidates do not truly know the reason they didn't get hired. Is bad credit an indicator that a person would steal? Not necessarily. I have to admit that if I had a retail business and ran a credit check that was poor, I probably wouldn't hire the person. The guise is that there are many pieces to the selection process, with one being a credit check if that's part of a company's protocol. But reality is that an employer may stop \"looking\" at the other pieces once a bad score on a credit check is documented. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires an employer to state in writing if they are not hiring someone due to an unsatisfactory credit or background check. This would then allow the candidate to explain or correct the problem. I doubt there are many of these letters being written. If an employer \"offers you the job\" on the contingency that you \"pass\" a credit and/or background check, then I believe they would have no choice but to notify you in writing if they withdraw the offer. But if you are authorizing a check before an offer of employment, you probably won't ever know if the results of such reports were the reason you were no longer being considered for the job. One of the posters said that many employers \"don't tell you\" they are running a check. This is not true. In order to run any type of check, they must get your written authorization to do so. There are so many people who think certain actions are in violation of privacy law. If they are thinking of questioning some action, they should check into it before commenting on the legality of it. There are many factors to consider when you are trying to land that job. There's always a chance that you can muster up some points in other areas, especially if someone who knows your past performance knows the employer and is a credible reference. All selection practices should follow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) guidelines. Does this occur? Not in reality in most cases. But it's an ethical company with upstanding practices that will do their best to do so because their reputation, both internally and externally, may be at stake. Who wants to work for an employer with a nasty reputation? The only way an employer is snagged for behaving badly is when a candidate takes action against them. Again, not an easy feat. Most people think that simply filing a claim with the EEOC will do the trick. With the increase in claims filed over the past two years (the highest being age-related claims) coupled with lack of information on the part of the claimant, a large percentage of claims are thrown out by the EEOC before they even take on a life of their own. An employer is notified that a claim has been filed and then notified when the \"case has been closed.\" An employer can readily pull together their defensible documentation to be claim ready. If they are functioning under the guise of \"best practices\", most likely they are solid in their documentation. In reality though, they very well may have altered an existing law to their advantage. I agree with the poster who said to keep trying. You never know what will happen. And if you don't continue to try, that's when you fail. Good luck!",
