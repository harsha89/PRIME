    "Content": "LOVE MY PORT!!! I was very sore too the first time I had treatment. The nurse said to close my eyes and take a deep breath. I did and she told me to let it go slowly, very slowly. I did and next she said, \"That's it.\" It did not hurt one single tiny bit. Couldn't believe it. After that, I wasn't afraid any longer. The only thing that really bothers me is wearing bras. If I wear one, it seems to push right where the port is. Doesn't hurt, just feels strange. Then I thought, shoot, I'm 64 years old, who needs a bra. No one's checking out my boobs anyway. And that's the end of it. My sister got me these pasties which cover the nipples so I'm not self-conscious when I wear a sweater. Works great and SOOOOOO much more comfortable. Good luck with your treatment.",
