      "Content": "Hi fighting4five, I just wanted to share with you that I am 43 now, was 42 at diagnosis. I had 2 tumors (2 and 3cm), lumpectomy, sentinal node neg, weekly Herceptin, 6 rounds TCH every 3 wks, 33 daily radiation, then continued with Herceptin every 3 wks for 1 yr. My last herceptin was 4/2011. So this is all so fresh for me and I can totally relate to how you are feeling. I was offered the added Adriomycin but declined. I've heard bad things about that drug and the effectiveness was something like 10% better by adding that to TC-not enough to convince me to add it. I'm not a doctor, but I THINK your doctor scribble means....T=Taxotere, H=Herceptin, A=Adriomycin (sp?), and C=Carboplatin. The 12 weekly treatments would be only Herceptin, that's a weekly infusion during chemo (12 weeks) then Herceptin changes to every 3 weeks up to the one year point-then you're done. Usually chemo is 3 weeks apart which would be your T, A, C. Of course on the every 3rd week you would also get H. I hope I'm making sense to you. Point being, if you haven gotten a port, I HIGHLY recommend one. You will be getting lots of pokes and ports are so easy to deal with. You can get one put in and have your infusion within days. I also recommend getting elma cream (prescription). This numbs the port area so you don't feel the stick. Also, your doc may also want you to get a MUGA scan every 3 months. Don't worry about this either, it's to check your heart (from the Herceptin) but it's a painless process. All in all, my experience was not too, too bad with chemo. A few rough days after chemo then gradually gets better. No side effects from Herceptin, and a little sunburn from radiation. This whole experience IS very scary, you are not alone. But once you go through your first chemo, each trip should get easier mentally. You CAN do this! You will find strength you never thought you had. You WILL get through this. I wish you all the best!",
