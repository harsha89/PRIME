Depending on what comes out of the confrontation, you either work it out or kick him out. That is what you owe yourself. My thoughts are with you. Eva",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I just realized that my, primarily nightly, sweating might be hot flashes. I am on cytoxan/taxotere and have been told there is a 20% risk this will put me in permanent menopause. Do you think this is what is happening to me? I have a vague memory of reading about \"temporary menopause\" caused by chemotherapy. Can I be going into this temporary menopause? If there is such a thing. I do want children and the prospect of having gone into menopause scares me. However, we have 13 frozen embryos that could help us should this have happened. I am grateful for any thoughts you could share. Eva",

      "Content": "Must love Chen's comment! Especially loved the coffee enemas reference. I don't know anything about deodorant causing cancer. However, I recently discovered the wonders of coconut oil! I have eczema, and my husband strongly believes that my strong eczema creams (stereoids) stunted my breast development as a young teenager. As my eczema has gotten much better (after I learned what foods cause it!), my breasts have grown from an A to a large B cup in a few (adult!) years. My husband believes this is because I have used less cream. So since my cancer diagnosis I threw out my eczema cream and have learned to control my eczema 100% only with coconut oil! Now finally to the point that can help YOU, I learned that some even put the oil under their arms as it is antiseptic. I have done the same and not used deodorant/antiperspirant in two months! It works! Only side effect is that you walk around smelling like a coconut :) Eva",

I buy my coconut oil at wholefoods in the oil section, its about 10 bucks, but Im sure you can order it online, just do a search on amazon. Be sure its organic and extra virgin. Let me know how you like it! Eva",

      "Content": "Hi there, I got diagnosed with BC early March, and am just going through fertility preserving treatment (I am under 30 years old). My chemotherapy will probably start as soon as my eggs are taken out next week. I just learned about the VAP. I have not met with my medical oncologist to ask about it, but I was wondering if someone here knew when it is used? My chemo will be four rounds of taxotere and cytoxan every three weeks. I can only get IV in one arm (the one not impacted by surgery), but have two good veins in that arm. Does anyone have experience with my treatment regiment with or without the port? Any comments are helpful. Eva",

I have tried acupuncture and it worked initially but does not seem to work anymore. I take my tamoxifen at 7.30 pm everyday. During the night, I wake up every two hours like clock work. Is it better to take the pill in the morning? Are there other ways you have found to minimize your hot flashes? All comments are much appreciated. Eva",
