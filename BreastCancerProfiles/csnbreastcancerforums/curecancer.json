      "Content": "Hi there, my name is Patty and I have been having Zometa for the last 6 years. Sometimes I feel alittle low the next day however, normally I don't have any side effects. I used to have it every month, now I get it every 3 months. I sure hope the next time you have it you will feel better. It truly is a wonderful bone strengthener. I call it my bone juice. Take care~ No fun having cancer thats for sure. Sincerely, Patty",
