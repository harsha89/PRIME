      "Content": "Hey Everyone, It has been a while since I have been here. I see there are alot of new people. Welcome, even though the reason you are here stinks. We are glad you found us. I do have a question, if anyone has any information. I finished taxotere and cytoxin (6 treatments) at the end of August 2010. I really did not have any \"bad\" side effects. I did however have a bladder infection afterwards. Recently, my back where my kidneys are has been hurting. It seems to be worse at the end of the day. Wondering if it could be a kidney infection or kidney failure assoicated with chemo. My onc. visit is in 2 weeks. Please let me know if you have any information. Thanks, Rhonda",
