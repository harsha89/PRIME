      "Content": "I had the same decision to make - bilateral/unilateral? I chose the bilateral, ultimately, and I'm glad that I did. I had LCIS, which was not discovered 'til the final path report. As far as surviving the wait, I think personally that the waiting is the most difficult part of this to deal with. Seems I was always waiting for this result, that result, this appointment, etc. Then the final few days before surgery - very difficult. You WILL make it through. I got a prescription for a mild tranquilizer, personally, and though I rarely actually took the things, just having them there \"in case\" was good. I need to lose about 30 pounds. A medication I was on caused a LOT of weight gain in a short period of time. Unfortunately, being only two weeks post-op, the exercise part of the equation is difficult, but I am definitely eating better and trying to do what I can. LOTS of fiber, really helps. Keep your metabolism going on high by moving, eating something for breakfast. Walk. Get support from others trying to do the same thing (I'm here!). It really helps. I did get the tissue expanders and will have implants. Right now I'm just hoping to get the drains out! :-)",
