    "Content": "Hi Jamie, I just joined today and I just want to thank you for sharing with me your courageous fight. I am amazed at how much we can handle and endure. I believe, that we all have something to fight for and life is the greatest of all. Someday, Santa will find a cure for Cancer, maybe not in our lifetime, but in someone else's and that's alright with me. I hope that Santa brings you smiles, hugs and love from Family, friends and everyone here online. I'll write again. Thank you for being you, Dakota128",
