    "Content": "Hi I also had DCIS and I have read everything I can get my hands on. From everything I have read and from what I have been told by drs is that the most important thing is clean margins. I was not comfortable at all as following the biopsy I had close margins, so I had the surgeon go back in and take more. I am now about done with 30 radiation treatments, they are very tiring and I am having some burning but I figure there are side effects with everything and it is not anything I can't live with. The hardest part for me is dealing with the emotional part and I find during treatment there is no resource for that at the cancer center - this site helps a lot and I have joined a support group. You have to get as much info as you can and make a decision that works for you. Best of luck and if you want to talk further I would be happy to - samarisews@aol.com - good thoughts coming your way!
