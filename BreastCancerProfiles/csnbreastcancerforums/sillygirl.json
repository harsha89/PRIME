    "Content": "My last chemo was Sep 5 of last year and I don't think a day goes by that I don't still think about it also. I see my oncholigist every two months because I am estregen negative and can't take tamoxafin. However, I am hitting my year mark of my last treatment and feel that with every passing day, I am one more day closer of releasing some of that axiety. I've gotten into other things like school and claimed my life back which has helped. To me having cancer is something that happened and I can let it control me or I can say NO you will not control me, I will control my life. It's been hard and I've also gotten into counceling and my counselor is also a breast cancer survivior, which has also helped me. Good luck on your journey and know we are fighters and survivors!!!!!!!",
