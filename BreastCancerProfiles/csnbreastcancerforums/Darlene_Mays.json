    "Content": "Hi...I too, am new to this site, having been diagnosed w/triple negative breast cancer in December, 09. I had sentinel node surgery, lympectomy, etc. Just had a port put in yesterday (great fun). but, I also have ulcerative colitus..not quite Krohns, but related I believe. I am 62. How are you tolerating all the \"stuff\"? I mostly do ok, but there are days when it's all a bit over-whelming. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
