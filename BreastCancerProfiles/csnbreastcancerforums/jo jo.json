      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your mom and your cancer. I had a bilaterial mastectomy in Nov 09. The breast surgeon removed my breasts and my plastic surgeon was right behind her putting in my expanders and somewhere in the process they removed my lymphnode to see if it was positive and if it is they remove more until they are all clear. When i woke up i had 3 drain tubes which i really did not like cuz you have to keep empting the fluid and measuring it...which isnt hard just an inconvience, but they buldged out from under your clothes...everyone thought i looked about 3 months pregnant! Then i went thru 6 rounds of chemo. Now my doc said they have to wait for at least one month after chemo before they can do any surgery. In the meantime we scheduled step 2 of reconstruction...exchanging my expanders for the silicone implants...I get this done July 14th...i cant wait cuz the expanders are hard they feel nothing like boobs but thats not there job, there job is to stretch your muscles and skin and i guess they cant be soft to do that? For months after i get the implants then i can have the nipple reconstruction. Now as far as coping with the surgeries...for me it wasnt that hard cuz i just focused on one thing...I get new boobs!!! I think alot of people will agree with me that after your mastectomy see a physical therapist especially if you have lymphnodes removed cuz they can help a great deal of getting your ROM back and with lmyphedema.",

      "Content": "Sorry this isnt BC related...but im stressed out over a situation and need to vent and maybe have some input of reassurance that i did the right thing. So here it goes. My cousin Georg (Stacys brother) was diagnosed with a very rare terminal disease about 4-5 years ago called stiffmans disease...roughly only 130 people have this in the world. From what they know about this disease they usually dont live more than 5 years. It is a horrible, nasty disease. Their muscles pull themselves away from the bones and their body becomes stiff...this just is a small part of what he goes thru and its very painful and he can hardly walk and hes very weak and he is only 41 years old. He has a 12 year old daughter that lives half with him and half with her mother. The mom lets her run the streets and do whatever she wants when she wants. The mom is an alcoholic and drug addict. Georg just got his daughter again 3 weeks ago. Now that ive set the stage now i can tell you what happened. Yesterday about 5pm i got to his house and found he was having another massive attack from his disease he has swelling on his brain so it triggers some bad side effects and with the muscles attacking his legs to were he couldnt move his legs and in severe pain. I called the ambulance and off to the hospital we went. With his disease these attacks are brought on by high stress. We were in the ER till about 11pm. He was actually sent home cuz the docs have no idea how to treat his disease...Georg is the only case that i know of that the docs ask him what should they do cuz they have no idea how to treat him. Weird i know but there are only a few docs that know how to treat it...so usually he tells them what they need to do and it usually works till he sees his doctor. Yes hes in the ER alot. While i was in the ER with him I found out that his 12 year old daughter has been physically abusing him. She would punch, kick and bit him and would draw blood. His body cant take that and hes to disabled to stop her visious attacks. So me and my sister set her up. After leaving the ER we left her alone with Georg and during this time he had his cell phone on so i could hear everything that was going on (of course she didnt know this), later 911 dispatch was also listening in without her knowing, cuz she was getting to the point that she was going to get violent with him ...thats when i walked back in cuz i was never very far. Shortly after that the police show up and she was admitted in a phyic unit. Georg was very upset about the situation cuz he didnt want to see his daughter go thru this and hes a good dad but he lost control once she figured out how much she could get away with cuz he couldnt do anything and she took advantage of the situation and him. I couldnt believe her actions after just taking him to the ER she was willing to put him thru more abuse like that. Once she leaves the mental health unit she will be going to a detention hall cuz i refused for her to ever be alone with him. Georg knows it had to be done but i just kept telling him hes got to show her this isnt normal and had to do a little tough love. Please tell me i did the right thing cuz last thing i would ever want is to split up a family!",

      "Content": "I dont like complaining about my surgeries and the care that goes with it cuz i really do like my team of doctors...and i dont want to sound petty but this is what happened. I got great care all the way up to going into the surgery room, once i got into the room (yes i was still awake and alert at this time) the nursing staff was very cold and unconcerned and treated me like i was just a body on the table and not a person. They made numerous mistakes by not reading my chart and alert braclets...they tried putting a BP cuff on the arm i had lymph nodes removed (WITH BRACLET ON SAME ARM SAYING...LIMB ALERT), and they were actually prepping the WRONG side...they were going to operate on the right side and it was my left side they were supose to do...luckly i was still awake to point out these very important mistakes and got treated like i was just a know it all tryin to tell them how to do there job. Plus i told them i wanted to know before they were going to put me out...well of course a nurse sneak in behind me and gave me the knockout drug and thats all i remember. Now after surgery im in recovery and im not really with it (at that stage you really dont remember much afterwards)but the pain is so intense thats all i do remember. Later i find out i was in recovery for 4 hours in great pain cuz they couldnt find my doctor to give me a stronger pain med. and they wanted to admit me cuz of it but they finally got ahold of her and i got the drugs i needed and home i went. Even though i shouldnt of been in that much pain in the first place. I woke up the next morning with the worst drug hang over i have ever had...i didnt know there was such a thing! Then of course the vomiting started...with fresh wounds that was no fun! Now two days into it i was still waking up with a drug hangover and i didnt even take my pain killers they sent me home with. Plus i tried to blow my nose and nothing but alot of dried blood came out...it was from the tube they put in your throat once your out plus it explained why i couldnt eat or swallow and i felt like something was caught in my throat. Fast forward to today...i was so excited cuz it was time to get my drain tube removed. They had a new girl and she was going to be removing it...great im her genny pig! I was preparing myself for them to start pulling it out...and i about jumped off the table swinging...my inside felt like it was on fire...i was not expecting this much pain from past experiences with it. They repeated this 3 times and each one was worse than the first ...the pain was so intense i thought i was going to pass out. Finally the regular nurse did it and it came right out. The new girl said it was stuck but it turns out she was trying to pull it out way to slow. Most of you know the feeling of having tubes removed ...some pain with a bubbling feeling...Not your insides being on fire and wanting to pass out from pain! Now tonight my whole left side just hurts, like i got the heck beat out of me and normally after its removed i feel better. This has just been a really bad experience for me this time but on another note...they operated on the side the were suppose to and i didnt end up with a swelled arm from a BP cuff and i havent really had to use any pain meds since ive been home and i can eat and swallow again and my drain tube is gone and i woke up from this surgery...wooo hooo! Sorry i didnt mean for this to be so long i guess i had alot of venting and the worst part is i still havent got a good look at the new boob lift yet!",

I have gained over 15 pounds, i know that doesnt sound like much but to me thats alot and its frustrating to try and put my regular jeans on that use to be kinda loose on me, to now referring to them as my skinny jeans cuz i have to literally squeeze into them and lay on the bed to get them zipped and tuck in my muffin top! Well my point of all this is that i didnt take my Tamoxifen for almost a week and boy did i get some effects from that ...good and bad. The bad i got very emotional...as if i couldnt make up my mind how i was feeling...one minute i was happy the next cryin or mad...we all know that rollercoaster, but the good was i lost almost 3 pounds...i couldnt believe it, yet depressing i have over 4 years to go on this stuff and 4 more years of who knows how many more pounds! So i think its safe for me to say that i know for me that Tamoxifen is what is causing my weight gain. Cant wait to get off it! :)",

I have been doing some research on nip reconstruction cuz i am approaching that stage as soon as my implants even out. Yet i decided i dont want any skin graphs and it seems talking with my PS about it theres really no getting around it so i may be just going to be getting the 3D tattooing. Im undecided right now on what to do but hearing positive things about it is a good thing for me to concider.",

I never realized just how bad of shape im in since this whole cancer thing...I really need to get crackin on exercising or something. We went to the mall of america...lots of SHOPPING!!!! We rode the lightrail to downtown Minneapolis and walked forever on the skywalks and did more shopping! We went to the muesum in st paul to see King Tuts mummy and his artifacts...they are on tour right now and it was really neat to see...very interesting if you like that kind of stuff. We had to park almost a mile away and walk to the muesum cause it was so packed and go up and back down 10 flights of stairs...no elevators in that parking garage and it was really cold too. But we did have alot of fun and im going back up sometime this summer and if everything goes ok we are going to fly to Paris or something like that. It was just good to see my daughter...shes such a sweetie! I dont think she has a mean bone in her body! For those of you that get on facebook my daughter posted pics on my page...sorry but i look really terrible in the pics...dont mean to scare anyone..lol! I just gained alot of weight and a few more wrinkles and got a little soft around the edges!",

      "Content": "I told all my doctors about the ablation and they all never said anything about it so i assumed it didnt have any affect with the BC treatments and of course mine was 3-4 yrs ago and yours is pretty recent. I do know that having the ablation puts you in premature menapause...i think i had my first hotflash after about a year after the ablation procedure. Now since the BC treatments like chemo and tamoxifen...while i was on chemo the hotflashes werent to bad for the most part (they did get bad at times -but it wasnt consistant)...then when i got on the tamoxifen they were tolerable for the first month or two...now holy cow, my hotflashes are in full force...they are worse than they ever been. IT SUX! They are more intense and last longer. My doc said i need to have a pap once a year to check for cancer along with an ultrasound cuz one tests for uterine cancer and one tests for ovarian cancer. When i had my ablation done i do remember him telling me that the lining can get thick again in rare cases...but i dont remember the details of it...its been to long ago and my brain doesnt function well enough to remember that far back. I do remember that i spotted for a short time after the procedure but once i got passed that the doc said if i ever spotted again that was a bad sign and to be aware of it. It would be interesting to know what your gyn says about it and youll have to fill me in on it and once i get my insurance again maybe i will bring this up to my docs as well. I know what ya mean about dressing in layers and its funny when your out somewhere you cant take off your layers...like being in a car with your seatbelt on its not worth all the trouble to take everything off only to have to put it right back on again cuz after all the sweating and being outside the sweat turns cold and the next thing you know your freezing....beside when im in the car i just stick my head out the window to get some relief...just like a puppy would do...hehe!",
