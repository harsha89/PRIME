      "Content": "My last chem was the end of November and I stopped wearing a wig the middle of February. It was really short but really thick. It felt so much better than the wig. I started taking prenatals in February and I am still taking them. It may be all in my head, but I think it helps. My doctor said it didn't really matter - but it wouldn't hurt.",

      "Content": "My hair was really straight before chemo. It came back wavy, but went back to straight after about six months. I really liked it wavy. I used a hair mouuse that had color in it until it came back fuller. I then used the color that was a shampoo that only lasted 28 washes (lasted alot longer for me). Bobbie Jo",
