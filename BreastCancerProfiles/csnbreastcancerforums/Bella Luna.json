You are a true, loving friend who cared enough to step in and protect your friend from further harm. His daughter is in dire need of help. Hopefully, the intervention she is getting will give her a much needed wake up call. I am glad Greg has you as an advocate and a dear friend. Your friend Greg is going through some serious challenges in his life. It's not easy, but I am sure having family and friends such as yourself helps ease the heavy burden some. You did good kid. Much love and hugs to you, JoJo.",

There was a patient at the infusion clinic where I went who had a pic line(?). I remember the patient sharing with the nurse about how her pic line occasionally snagged on her clothes or the friction irritated her arm from time to time. I also remember the lady had some attachments that suspended from her arm. These attachments were secured to her arm when she was done with her infusion. I think they bandaged her arm afterwards. I don't know if showering was an issue as well. Best of luck with your decision and your recovery.",

      "Content": "Morning All, Am feeling a bit antsy as I have been told by my oncologist, yet again, they might have to delay my chemo start up date on a account of a skin infection that developed on my lumpectomy incision. Note to others... don't go to the gym even though the doctor clears you ready for exercise. I was on an antibiotic, Keflex, and had an allergic reaction in the way of hives! I found out the hard way that I was allergic to the med after taking Keflex for about 9 days. I broke out in hives shortly after the 9th day. On Wed, Sept. 9th, I called the oncologist's nurse and was told to stop taking Keflex and see my surgeon about my situation and to take Benedryl. Luckily, I was able to squeeze in an appt. with my surgeon who, in turn, agreed that, yes, I am allergic to Keflex and referred me to an Infectious Diseases Specialist! On Thurs, Sept. 10, I went to see the I. D. doctor, lovely man with great bedside manners, and he agreed with the others about it being a classic case of an allergic reaction to a drug. He said my infection is probably a STAPH infection and, therefore, I would require another antibiotic, Avelox and Hydroxyzine, to further treat the infection. Just as well as Benedryl was not doing a thing for the hives. On Friday,Sept. 11th, I met with my cardiologist and filled him in on the saga. I was referred to a cardiologist as I am going to be on Hercepin. He will be following me up while I am on chemo. He is a another wonderful doctor who happens to be a cancer survivor! My 9 year old daughter, by the way, started school on September 9, 2009. I was very happy for her as she is starting 3rd Grade. Even though it was beautiful day, I wore a sweater over my shoulders as I didn't want to bring further attention to the lovely patch work on my arms and hands. Thank heaven, her 1st day of school was wonderful! I need to say that, yes, my daughter does know I was diagnosed with cancer and about the chemo treatments. Over the summer, I took her wig shopping with me and found one that is similar to my hair color. The organization gives free wigs and hats to women battling cancer. A wonderful program! My daughter helped pick out hats and was given one of her very own! Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that I have a port insert scheduled for Tues. Sept. 15th. I was told the antibiotic will not interfere with surgery. Now, I must call the oncologist once again to see whether we can keep the Sept. 24th date for chemo as the antibiotic is only for seven days. I will keep my fingers crossed all goes well. Prayers and good wishes much appreciated. I feel I have been caught in limbo, yet again! All this drama is not good. Have to see the lighter side of things; otherwise, my nerves will get the better of me. If nothing else, I will get to keep my black locks for a longer period! Best to all! God bless you too.

I didn't bring a camera, but Debi and Olga took plenty of pictures.

      "Content": "Morning All, I had a bone density test done yesterday. It was a snap! It took about 10 minutes. It was so much easier than an MRI. My doctor recommended I have one on account of the treatment I received( chemo, rads, Tamoxifen) over the course of time. I am 45 years old, premenopausal, and had two lumpectomies. I have to say my monthly has not come back. Just a suggestion... you might want to ask your doctor about the test if it hasn't come up in conversation. I know each Survivor is different. I am just saying. Take care, God bless. BL",

      "Content": "He mentioned that he was in Japan last week and saw the devastation. While he was there, he caught an infection and was on antibiotics. At the advice of his doctor, he canceled several speaking engagements, but was able to make yesterdays event. He has a peaceful, kind, and happy aura about him. He also loves to laugh. Unfortunately, the acoustics weren't so great and he speaks with a heavy accent. I was straining to listen to what he was saying. I caught pearls of wisdom here and there. One of the things he mentions is the TEMPLE( Mind, Body, Soul). He didn't say temple, per say, but makes reference to bettering your mind and body. He said that individuals should strive to work at reaching their potential, and how everyone has potential. He also said to have a happy earth, you have to have a happy community. To have a happy community, you have to have a happy family. To have a happy family, you have to be a happy individual. It starts with the individual and carries out to others. To me it seems that he choices to be happy. It's a state of mind, I suppose. It's a simplistic analogy, but one that is easily understood. They had a question and answer period followed by a few quotes. One of the Dalai Lama's quotes goes like this...\" My religion is kindness.\" Another mentioned was by Abraham Lincoln, \" When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad.\" Simple and practical. Just so that you know, I am not a Buddhist. I do, however, respect his person and teachings. I am not advocating a religion or way of life, just a share for those who might be interested. Take care, God bless. Ines",

You have gone through so much and continue to do so. It's not easy and I feel for you. Real life might be awaiting you back home; but, until then, you have time to play in the sun and drink in the sights, people, and all that Europe has to offer! I am happy you are sharing this experience with your parents and your boyfriend. I may only know you via CSN but I love you, Kat! You are a beautiful young woman. You do your parents PROUD and all your Pink Sisters and Brothers! Big Hugs to You.",
