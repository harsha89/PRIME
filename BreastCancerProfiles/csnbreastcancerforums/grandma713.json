    "Content": "My sister-in-law recently was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has had her breast removed and lymph nodes and the lymph nodes were clear. However because it is a very \"nasty\" type of breast cancer they are starting her on chemo, ACT, I believe. One is Taxol and the other two I cant be sure of the names. My question is, do you have any \"tricks of the trade\" to help her get through this treatment as easily as possible? Any suggestions I can give her? She does not have a computer and cant post for herself but I am a frequent visitor of the \"semi-colons\" because of my own cancer battle. I know from there what help all of you can be by sharing your experiences. So, thank you in advance... Franny",
