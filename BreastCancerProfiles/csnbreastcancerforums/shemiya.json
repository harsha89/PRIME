    "Content": "Goodmorning wsmsilva, I finished chemo 23rd Dec.2003, by the middle of January I got rid of all my coverings. My hair had covered my head and it looked as if I just had a really short haircut. you would not believe the compliments I got about my hair cut. I'd just say thanks it is not my haircut its my new hair after chemo and I'm so proud to have it. It also came back curly. I got it trimmed for the first time about 3 weeks ago. It is shoulder length now. Good luck to you and do whatever is comfortable for you. Shemiya",
