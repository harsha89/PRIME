    "Content": "I'll be taking my first dose of Femara in about 2 hours, right before bedtime. I already had bone changes, detected in a scan before my cancer diagnosis, and my PCP had me on calcium and vitamin D. When my blood tests were done for the oncologist, she saw a vitamin D deficiency and, along with my Friday Night Femara, I'll be taking a mega-dose of vitamin D once a week for 12 weeks. The doctor will test again at one of my monthly appointments. I intend to keep taking the calcium, too.",
