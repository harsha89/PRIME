    "Content": "I know this is a personal choice. My surgeon gave me the option. I was BRCA negative. I asked him what he would advise his own wife and got my answer. When you have a mastectomy you sever all the nerves between the skin and muscle. The tissue between the two is removed as is the nipple. You keep no feeling no sensation nothing whatsoever and this is permanent. I decided to not live in fear of a maybe cancer down the road. I kept the other breast and at least have that erogenous zone remaining. I am glad that I did. I can still always change my mind but once it is gone it is gone forever and you can't get it back. I had reconstruction using tissue expander and subsequent implant and while it looks natural in clothing, it is not a breast. It doesn't behave like a breast. You do not get a new breast like some celebreties would have you believe. It just isn't true. Just my 2 cents opinion but with the knowledge that it was the right one for me and many others have made a different one and are happy. Just go into it knowing everything there is to know. You cannot reverse it.",
