    "Content": "Does anyone know if increased bruising is a concern on Tamoxifen; (I've been on it 4 months) I have 2 large bruises that showed up yesterday, one on my leg, and one on my arm, and I don't even remember bumping myself. Is this common, or is this something to report? Also, I have a rash under my arm along area that was subject to radiation. Looks like prickly heat - raised bumps, doesn't itch. I noticed it a few weeks ago, only a few bumps, but now there are quite a few more. See onco Dr in a month. Anyone see this before? I tend to think it is a post-radiation thing, but will call radiation oncologist tommorrow.....P.s.. I hope everyone had a nice Christmas holiday yesterday, and I extend my wish for a Happy and HEALTHY new year to all on the site...!",
