    "Content": "Hi everyone. I am considering a mastectomy after a lumpectomy and I am thinking about the Tram Flap. I am not sure if this is a good idea and would like feed back on your surgeries. Is it worth it? Would you do it again or do you think implants are better for reconstruction. I have read a lot of negative things from women who have had bad experiences with this type of reconstruction. I worry about recurrence so that is why I am considering a mastectomy and reconstruction. Can't wait to hear from you.",
