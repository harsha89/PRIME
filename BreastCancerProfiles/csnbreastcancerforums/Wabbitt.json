    "Content": "I love this site but I get more confused about what is best. I had bil mast on the 25th.  Microinvasive DCIS ..tumor size .06. Neg to lymph node. HER2 - neg Margins clear overall score 3 (not sure what that means but sounds good) Here's my dilema, at first follow up surgeon's PA was thrilled at how nothing involved, great progress and said I would not have to do any Tamoxifen, chemo or radiation.  They called back after discussion with surgeon and would like me to go on Tamoxifen only from the stand point that one cell could always have gotten away even though the invasiveness was so small.  I don't understand the turn around, are they just going through the normal motions?  Is it really necessary? I am going to get a second opinion from an oncologist.  What has been others experience on Tamoxifen or other estrogen blockers.  I all ready have osteoporosis and have been post menapauesal for over 20 yrs.  I am 61.  ",
