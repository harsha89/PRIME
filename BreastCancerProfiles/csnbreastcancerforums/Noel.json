I am sure that between him and you, you will come up with something that might help quitting. I had a girlfriend that kept carrots always on hand, tootsie roll pops, anything that she could eat or just put in her mouth to prolong her lighting a cigarette. And, when she wanted to smoke, she would just put it off for maybe 15 minutes or so longer, and eventually, she was not smoking for hours in between. I know it is difficult to quit, and, I am so proud of you for trying. I am sending you lots and lots of will power! Hugs, Noel",

I will certainly ask my radiation oncologist before I use anything else, but, I just wanted some options. And, my skin feels so tight, especially at the top of the radiation on my throat. And, this is weird, but, my nose has been congested ever since I started radiation. They say it isn't possible that the radiation is doing it, but, it started with my first treatment, gets better on the weekends when I don't have treatments, and then gets worse when I start again.

It says that it SHOULD be used in conjunction with mammography, MRI and biopsy's. They compliment each other it states. No where in any article does it state that it can show up microcalcifications, which is a big part of what alerts tech's to the fact that there is something going on in a breast. A mammogram shows this up. This thermography was very helpful, but, shouldn't be the only test you have for breast cancer, as, it can miss cancer. It also states that over 23% of all breast cancers are found in women under 49. That was kind of shocking. They kind of alude to the fact that it is because of the estrogen. Which, I think, we all know is a huge factor in breast cancer.",

My chest was elevated so that my boobs kind of hung down in a thing. When they put the stuff in me, thru the iv, it made me feel weird, but, it only lasted a few minutes, maybe seconds. You have to lay perfectly still. The machine is very noisy. Also, the techs keep talking to you thru headphones and you can listen to music if you want. Hope that helps you! I took a nerve pill beforehand to help me to relax. Good luck!",

If you want to add someone as a friend, just click on their name, a screen will come up asking if you want to add them as your friend, and, click on yes or add if you want to add them as a friend. I think that is how it works. You can try it with me if you want. And, I like your funny bear, or, I guess it is a bear. lol ♥ Noel",
