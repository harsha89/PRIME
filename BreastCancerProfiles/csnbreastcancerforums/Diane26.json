    "Content": "Congratulations!! I'm so happy for you. It's nice to hear that it does come to an end of sorts. I too use this board for my support group. I am just coming out the other side of my 3rd of 8 chemos. They seem to get harder to rebound from. I thought once I got through one I'd know what to expect but they have all been different. I hope you are doing something very important to you to celebrate. Stay well, Deb.",
