    "Content": "Hi! My oncologist has not done any scans or baselines and does not suggest it. I was early stage 2 (bilateral), estrogen and progestogen positive and her2neu+ with 2 positive nodes. I had a double mastectomey, 4 AC, 4 taxotere and 28 radiations. I just finished last month, and I don't think I'll have any markers done. I am beginning to feel stronger and if I feel OK I don't see the need. But, I will probably have my ovaries removed before the end of the year to prevent any chance of ovarian cancer. By the way, I am 41 with 2 samll children. Let me know what you decide - I am on the fence about this, but I trust my onc. and am so fed up with doctors... I'll ask about the tests again at my 3 month visits in September. Best of luck. Dakota",
