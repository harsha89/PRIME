      "Content": "Hi- i 35 and was dx in 4/02 with Stage III Breast Cancer, I took Tamoxifen for approx 2 years and am now on Aromasin. I started Actonel after I was dx with osteponenia. But in 2009 my bone density test showed it was Osteporosis. I continued on the Actonel, but recently had the Reclast infusion. I no longer have to take Actonel and hope that my next bone density test shows that the Reclast has helped. Reclast is only approved for Osteoporosis so you may be a candidate. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I was taking Actonel and Vitamin D and Calcium but did my first Reclast infusion in Jan 2010. I was also worried about the side effect seeing I had numerous reactions to other drugs/chemo etc, but I had NO problem with the Reclast. The infusion took about 20 minutes, I still take Calicum and Vitamin D daily but no longer have to take the Actonel. I am hoping that the Reclast will build up my bones, I will find out next year when I have my bone density test. Karen",

      "Content": "Hi Lola, I was 35 when dx 7 years ago and never had a mammogram until that dreadful day. I did find the lump myself and called my OBGYN. It was an 8cm tumor and it seriously just was there. Had 2 Dr appts months before and nothing was felt by them or me. My sisters immediately went for one, I have 3 sisters, at the time they were 37, 33 and 32. Because there was now a family history they are screened every year. We had no family history of breast cancer or any cancer so we didn't get a mammogram before my dx. I did the BRCA1 and BRCA 2 gene testing and it was negative. Hope this helps. Karen",

I was in a clinical trial and the results are amazing! So happy I did it and didn't have any problems with it. It is truly saving lives.",
