My mother died in a head on collision 4 yrs ago down from my kids high school (she was picking them up). I hope the family is able to find reasons and get closure for this. The mental trauma can last years, if not a lifetime. I don't know if the forum has pm, but if it does, feel free to write. I will and have prayed for you and the family... Angelisa",
