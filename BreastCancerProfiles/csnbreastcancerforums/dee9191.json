    "Content": "In response to Jane who said \"I have not been getting Tylenol or benadryl with my Herceptin. I am wondering why\". Most of the ladies at my clinic don't get the \"pre-meds\" unless they show some symptoms during/right after infusion. I get the benedryl because the infusion causes me to ITCH ITCH ITCH! I also infuse over 45 minutes instead of 30. It's kind of fun sometimes. The nurses try to remember who is a Tylenol/ benedrl/ 30; who is just Tylenol/30; and me just a Benedryl/45 :) Btw, I have been on weekly Herceptin for close to two years now. Aching joints, fatigue, and a dropping EF as shown on my MUGA's are the only side effects I experience.",
