      "Content": "Hi Tulsa, with my first meeting, all I did was cry, he listened then told me everything that I needed to know. He left a great impression upon me as being a very caring man.All we did was sit and talk and then he did feel my breasts, that was all he did. My second appointment took place because I wasn't feeling right with the rude and uncaring way my surgeon was handling things, so I went to see my oncologist again, so I sat there and cried in front of him one more time, he said he would take over and take care of me. The following day I had an appointment with a plastic surgeon because my oncololgist pulled his weight and got me into his office, the next day I had an appointment with a new surgeon, the oncologist said he would take care of everything and he has. I am getting a port put in me on Wednesday and later that same day I am getting my first of 12 chemo cycles started. And this is all because of the new surgeon and my oncologist and myself agreeing that \"let's get this show on the road\". This coming spring I will have a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, from there I don't know exactly what happens next. But I have been lucky, and blessed to find this wonderful dotor. Ask everything, and they whould tell you the answers to your questions. Love Ronda",

I had breast cancer back in 2010, my right breast, I did the chemo, the lumpectomy, the radiation (which was the worst part I might add) and almost got to 5 years when crap here it was again. I got this crap again in the same breast, only this time around it was IDC, first time it was ILC, what fun right? I went with the DIEP, I now have 2 breasts, they're a lot smaller than my originals but hey I'm still here to talk about it, huh? It is what it is, you face this crap again, you do what you have to do, you don't really have a choice unless of course you don't want to do anything. Stay strong, be brave, you'll get through it again. I have put it all behind me and everyday I move forward. Â ",

Then the following day went back and they gave me a ct scan, a lady marked a couple of spots on me with what looks like a black magic marker and then when the scan was done she asked me what time I would like for the treatments. I told her mornings were fine. That's it, it took all of 10 minutes. Today she called and said I start on Monday at 11:15. Okay then what is this simulation I see others mention. They never put me in a mold. It didn't take 45 minutes like some of you have said. What did they leave out?",
