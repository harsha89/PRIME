I just read your discussion on the board and i like if you want to know about your treatment and experience so I can help my mom. they only gave her one chemo because she is so weak and the gave her the chemo pills and she don't want to take the pills. Is like she gave up without triying.  And I'm desperate.  hope the best for you. Thanks        Norma ",
