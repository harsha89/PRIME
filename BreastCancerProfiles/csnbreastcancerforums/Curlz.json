      "Content": "Everything you all are expressing makes total sense. The good (???) part about new people joining these boards is that they can 'meet' people who have been where they are, can learn from their experiences, and maybe ease their own fears a bit. Those of you who have been on these boards longer than us 'newbies' have connected with each other in a way that some of us haven't yet. Let us lighten the load where we can while you all mourn--it's part of the cycle. Very sorry for the loss of our sister--the rest of us need to continue to be strong for ourselves and each other!

      "Content": "We're all on this board thanks to the ACS, and they have a wonderful program called Reach to Recovery...if there's no office close to where you live, there are still volunteers who will call and talk to you by phone. These are women who have had breast cancer and gone through extensive training to become R to R volunteers, and it's exactly what they do! I just went on the purple Find Support and Treatmen tab off www.cancer.org (ACS's home page), followed the links to find locations in your area, and this is the first one that came up (but there were others): Portage (877) 499-4673 PLEASE call them...the program is FREE, and as a former ACS staff member (can you tell?!?) I can tell you that even with the knowledge I had from working there, I found my Reach volunteer to be a tremendous help!",

      "Content": "The other thing you might do is call the ACS' general 800#; the people who answer that line are doing nothing but talking to patients and their family members. I'm betting that if you explain to someone there that you were mismatched w/your original Reach volunteer that they'll work to find someone whose experience and Dx aligns more with yours. If nothing else, they can look outside of your area--phone calls and emails don't have geographic boundaries! As for your 'friend,' I'll share an experience that I had this year with one of my closest female friends...she was going through a lot of sh*t in her own life, and although I'm usually the person everyone turns to for support, I reached a point where I literally didn't have it in me to deal with her any more. When we did speak or email, she always asked how I was, I'd say that I was okay but ridiculously tired, and then she'd launch in to her own drama updates. Little by little, I stopped communicating much, which is VERY rare for me. Once I was finally over the hump of radiation and starting to feel like myself again, we really talked about it. She thought I was pushing her away and didn't WANT her support, and decided that I didn't want her friendship (HER issue, obviously). I just kept saying \"You're not listening to me...the ONLY person I gave any energy to was ME. I barely had enough to do that, and that's how I went to work and treatment every day. But that was all I had. I had nothing left for anyone else.\" Once she really heard me, she realized that SHE should have pushed more and should have realized that for once, I actually NEEDED others to be there for me. Sometimes those of us who are generally strong are afraid to admit that, most especially if we're functioning on the surface. This is my long-winded piece of advice: be open to help, be willing to ask for it, and if you're sure you're being clear about it and you're still not getting what you need, move on to find people who DO get it. Even if they're on this board vs. physically in your life! There are call-in support groups too. Make YOU your priority as much as possible right now!",
