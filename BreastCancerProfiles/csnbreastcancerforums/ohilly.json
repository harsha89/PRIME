It's not even the same type of cancer, but I have been SO depressed since hearing about this. I had stage I cancer, but BRCA positive, but after listening to the Farrah Story, I keep on thinking how this could be me in a couple of years. I don't want to think this way, but just wondered if the story affected anyone else. Cancer is so horrible, and it could happen to anyone. Ohilly",

      "Content": "I just went thru a mastectomy in February (I have invasive intraductal, did not spread to the lymph nodes with a 1.1.cm tumor). I am currently going thru chemo, but just today found out that I have the BRCA 1 gene. I am so depressed that I have this gene: I listened to what my doctors said - which was that it does not affect my survivability as long as I go forward with my plan to have a prophylactic mastectomy as soon as my chemo is over - but I am just depressed anyway. I was just starting to have a more positive attitude and now I feel like for sure I am going to die. I also read on the internet that BRCA 1 carries a worse prognosis than BRCA 2, but then the doctor (head of a genetics program at a major teaching hospital in Chicago) told me this is not true and that my survival is the same as any other bc patient. Can anyone else tell me something positive about having the gene. I am really down. Ohilly",

      "Content": "This is an issue I can definitely relate to: I was upset for a long, long time (as other people on this board can attest to given my numerous posts on the subject) because my hair came back thin. I wasn't upset during the chemo when I actually lost my hair because I was so sure it would come back exactly the same way. It was when it came back thin that I got upset. But I want to tell you that there was a happy ending: after figuring out that it was the Femara I have to take that thinned my hair, I went to a hair stylist who styled my hair and was able to camouflage it so well that people constantly tell me my hair looks great and even better than before. I got it cut layered and with highlights, also lightened up the color which hides the thinness. I also use a product that is made of keratin fibers that you sprinkle on your hair and it hides the thin spots - its called Toppik and there is a website: www.toppik.com or it is available at Sally's Beauty Supply stores. Hope this post will help you. Believe me, I understand how upsetting hair loss can be. But I am telling you the truth that it no longer upsets me and I look fine despite my thinner hair! Ohilly",

      "Content": "I had a complete hysterectomy in 2001 for fibroids (this was longer before being diagnosed with breast cancer). It wasn't that bad, and I'm really glad I did it because I have since found out I have the BRCA 1 gene, which means you can get ovarian cancer as well as breast cancer. It also lowers your risk of getting breast cancer if you have a hysterectomy. After my hysterectomy, I had virtually no bad effects. I feel fine. I say: go for it! Ohilly",

      "Content": "I have invasive intraductal cancer and had a mastectomy on Feb. 21. I am hoping someone can say something encouraging or at least help me to put into perspective the results of my Oncotype test. Until I got the results this past Monday, I was actually pretty hopeful: my cancer is estrogen positive, the tumor was only 1.1 cm, and it did not spread to the lymph nodes. I am considered Stage I. However, the Oncotype test gave me a score of 28, which is in the high intermediate range. I am definitely going to do the chemo which will lower my risk of a distant recurrence to 12%, but ever since I got that score, I am so down. The way I look at it, it basically means I have a 12% chance of dying from a distant recurrence. I realize this also means I have an 88% chance of living, but I just can't seem to look at it that way. Did anyone else have a relatively high Oncotype score and how did they deal with this? I also try to tell myself that this test is very new and only represents probabilities, but it is disheartening. Thanks. Ohilly",

I don't know about stage IV people being on this board, but one suggestion I have is to call up the American Cancer Society and ask them about Metastatic Cancer survivors organizations. I am from Chicago and I believe there is one locally. Again, welcome! Ohilly",
