    "Content": "Dear PDV, First of all, I still hope that it is not cancer! It was just a month ago that I was where you are. After the biopsy, I called the nurse from the diagnostic center to find out the results. At the time I was at work, and was expecting to hear that it was cancer. Even being \"ready\", it took my breath away to hear the words. The wise nurse told me one thing first -- BREATHE. Even when it is scary, you still remember to find the time to take full, healthy, cleansing breaths. Since then I had a partial mastectomy and a port. I begin my first chemo on Friday. One thing that doctors will go over with you is a computer generated \u201dstatistics\u201d of people with your specific tumor. The statistics are shown with and without adding chemo. We had friends who advised us to think carefully about chemo, but when I saw the numbers, all I could think of was having a greater chance to see my sons wed and playing with grandchildren. Just think carefully about your choices and what you ultimately want from your life. You will make the best choice for yourself. My first chemo is Friday. I am nervous but strong. You can do this also My best to you, Lisa",
