      "Content": "I had Cytoxen and Adryiamicin(sp?). Mouth sores where a very common side effect. My oncologist prescribed and special mouth rinse to use twice a day whether I felt them come on or not. It helped a lot. I only got on small one throughout my chemo regimen. Don't hesitate to ask your doctor about any concerns you have. They should be more than happy to explain things to you and I believe the mouth rinse is routinely prescribed for people when their going through chemo. Best, Sally",

They usually start you on 37.5 mg. for about a week and then double it the next week. 75mg. is usually the \"standard\" dose that people stay on. Though there are those that go up to 150mg. But that's usually for people that are having major depression. I'd definitely try a lower dose. You may well get the same benefit of lessening your hot flashes without all the bad side effect. Good Luck, Sally",

Of course you are going to feel bad as your body has been fighting a war with all the drugs in your system! But in the end, you will come out the winner!! You're almost at the finish line!! Just keep reminding yourself that \"this too shall pass\" because it will! You're hair will grow back. You CAN lose the weight you gained from chemo. If your breast still bothers you in several months, you can always choose to get it fixed. It's just gonna take some time to feel better. We live in a \"want it NOW\" world. And unfortunately, recovering from cancer takes a little bit more time! Remember to be good to yourself! Get plenty of rest. Try to go for walks if you can and do stuff that you really enjoy and that feeds your soul. You may not get back exactly to the way you were, the boobs will always be slightly skewed! LOL. ANd...having cancer does change a person....for the better I believe. We get to experience the mundainess(sp?) of life in a whole new prespective and truly understand what is really important in this life. That my friend, is a gift! God has a purpose for all things. Even you getting cancer. You may not know the hows and whys in this lifetime, but on the otherside, God will reveal to you all the good that came out of it! Anyway, sorry for rambling! I think your feelings are totally normal. I would think something was \"off\" if you didn't go through an occassional pity party and crying fest!! It's the healthy thing to do!! Hope the coming days are better for you! Glad you could find comfort on this board with the rest of us \"sisters\"! Blessings, Sally",

      "Content": "Candace, Dealing with BC, no matter what stage you're diagnosed with, is REALLY hard! I think we all at one time or another, second guess ourselves. Truth is, none of us know what tomorrow will bring. We can only do our best at making decisions that we \"think\" are right for us at the time. I initially had a lumpectomy. It WASN'T better than having a mastectomy, which I was initally up for. My doctor ended up taking half my breast to get clean margins. I lived with the disfigurement for 4 years before opting to have a mastectomy and Lat Flap reconstruction. I wish I didn't wait so long. I also decided to do it for the \"extra\" insurance of having the cancer not come back in that breast. I know it's scary and you're dealing with a lot of emotions right know. I think it's GREAT that you're looking into joining a support group. They really do help! You may also want to talk to your doctor about anti-depressants. It's VERY common for people to go on them after such a life altering experience. You said you wanted your life back. Well, you still have it! You are just a little different. One can't help but change, grow and become a stronger person after going through cancer. We may not ever have our old \"selves\" back (or our bodies), but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Give yourself time. It takes awhile to process everything you've just been through. Life does get better and there will come a time when you won't think about breast cancer 24/7! Be thankful they caught it early. The fact that the nodes where all clear is HUGE! People with lymph involvement are much more likely to have to battle recurrances. Hang in there. Vent as often as you need to. Things will get brighter eventually!! Hugs and Blessings, Sally",

I didn't try it again until a good 3 years later. I figured since he was still buggin' me about it, I'd try it again. I still had side effects, but they didn't seem to be as bad. Amazing how your body changes after a couple of years! So, I kept going. I now have 1 more month and I'm done! Whoo-hoo. I would at least give it a try. Everyone's side effects are different. Actually, I didn't feel much different until the 3 or 4 month on the stuff. And things just have ebbed and flowed. I'm now having really hot \"hot\" flashes that I haven't had before. I'm also getting older, so it could be the start of the \"real\" change. Anyway...I know as much as I hated being on it, I gave myself the best chance NOT to have a recurrance! So, I can look back and know I did all I was suppose to do:) All that is to say... I'd at least try it. You can always stop it if you think it's not for you!:) (sorry, I'm kinda of winded in my responses!:)LOL.) Sally",
