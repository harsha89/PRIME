    "Content": "My mother-in-law is having a mastectomy today. She is in Kansas and I am in Arkansas but my heart and thoughts are with her. We are expecting a grandson anytime so she wanted us to wait and not have to make two trips. I have four sister-in-laws, so she has plenty of support.It is still hard not to be there, though. She found out about her cancer on her 71st birthday. Great present, huh? I'm not sure if it makes it easier to deal with since I know what she is going through or not. It probably does. She has always been so healthy and active, so I know that will benefit the way she handles this. Please keep her in your prayers. Her name is Rosemary. Sherry",
