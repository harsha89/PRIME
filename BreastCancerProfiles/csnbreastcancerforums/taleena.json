I know how that can play on your psychy... Look at in the sense of the words true meaning... love.. people care enough to donate to causes that help others who come into a difficult time... at one time or another each of us has been or will be there. I agree with an earlier post, contact ACS they have programs available to assist people with getting their medications. Also, talk to the social worker at the hospital where you receive your treatment. Call your local Department of Social Services office..(you may qualify for assistance with medical as a supliment).. I did some research this morning.... and made some calls... here is the web site that I went to: I called the National Number for Medicaide.. depending on your income (I explained that you work only part time) you may qualify for state medicaide the number for the state of Florida is 888-419-4356 .. depending on your income, you may qualify for this even though you have \"some\" medical coverage and I use that word lightly.... Another number they gave me for Florida is an Agency caled Eldercare:.. Now don't get discouraged it is not solely for the elderly and I am not implying that you are \"elderly\".. however they have a wonderful directory available for organizations in \"your area\" that can help you find what you need... please give them a call and they can give you further information... their number is 1-800-677-1116. Scratch that number.. I called and got the number for your local office.. (had to go back to the \"where are you from post\".. yours is in Fort Meyers, FL their number directly is 239-332-3049. They weren't open yet this morning so I couldn't get more information for you.. but do give them a call and explain your situation. Both of these numbers were given to me from the information number on the web site I gave you.. the gentleman I spoke to also suggested the number to ACS and offered me the number.. I assured him we already have that one.. lol Looking up this information was no big deal.. I'm off on Fridays so it just gave me something to do!.. I hope some of this helps. Best wishes... & hugs ~T",

I remember the first time I ever heard about it... about being careful after lympth nodes were removed... it was after my surgery, after the drains were out... after being sent down stairs from my oncologists office to the lab for a blood draw... I stuck out my left arm (bad side) and she put on the tourniquet and ouch!! I jumped because it hurt and she asked if she pinched my skin... I said... \"No my arms just sore from my surgery two weeks ago they removed 13 lympth nodes\"... she had that tourniquet off in a flash and proceeded to tell me no no no... you can't have blood draws on this arm... No one had told me anything about it... so I came home and jumped on line... to these boards... and I asked all of you...my wonderful warrior sisters... and you all came to my rescue and educated me where my surgeon failed miserably to do so!! Thanks for posting this Kathy... some of us really have no clue...(like me)..lol... and knowing that we can sometime down the road ... just kind of forget.. well... it's a day that I look forward to with much anticipation!

I'm glad the neighbor helped you get it into the house...lol One of my very favorite Christmas memories, (though not real funny at the time) was when my children & I picked out the perfect tree...it was all the way in the back of the lot...we all thought it was perfect... well, we got it home..into the house and low and behold it took up 1/2 the living room.. then there was a big knot on the base of the trunk so it took twice as long set in the base... after the lights and decorations were put on and we were all tucked in bed fast a sleep a crash came from the living room.... our cat had tried to crawl up it and the base & knot were just too much and down came the tree... lost some ornimants that year including a couple the children had made... :0( that made me sad ... but fear not, they made me more... and we had a wonderful Christmas.. and thought we still had the most beautiful tree around!! Wishing you & Jake a very Merry Christmas! Hugs, ~T",

I am 42... becuase of family history (my mother had breast cancer twice, once at 38 and the second time at 42 which she opted for mast. each time 28 and 30 years ago)... because of her history, I have been having annual mamograms since I was around 30. The doctor thinks that I my cancer was present several years ago... thank goodness it was grade one and very slow growing... Though there was an area of concern for over a year and a half, which by the way they never biopsied, I ultimately found it myself when it had grown enough to be felt standing up in the shower. It was the same area the breast clinic had been \"watching\"..... Because of this experience, I am an avid believer in teaching and telling our daughters and granddaughters, nieces and friends, to do self exams... we need to know our own bodies, and when we sense something changing we need to speak out...",

My son woke me up at 11:30... my little sister (who is around the same age as my oldest two children) was on her way to the hospital, her water broke... I called my brother in law and he told me she was asking for me... so I threw on some sweats and was out the door... Daddy slept mostly through the night in the converted \"daddy chair/bed\" as I coached my little sister through labor... at 8:30 this morning I woke him up and with him on one side of her, and I on the other... we helped her focus as little (5 lbs. 9 oz / 18\" long) Abigale Rose entered into the world.... Now, I'm here at work (shhhhh... don't know if you can tell, but I'm whispering)... tooth picks keeping my eyes open, as I sit in awe of the miracle of life... Hugs, ~T",

Though my appointment was much earlier, I also had that wonderful girl appointment today... just couldn't make my day any better...lol... The rad treatment was painless... ackward... and nerve racking.. .but I made it through it... The most interesting thing about my day was my new gyno... as I was sitting there on the table (first time meeting her)... she said \"this maybe a little unprofessional, but I want to show you something\" and unbottoned the first two buttons on her shirt to reveal her own tattoos from radiation.... my new girl doctor... is a fellow survivor... talk about tears of relief... she got it... she got me... she understood... and then she buttoned it and gave me a hug.... she talked with me about the Zoladex and Femera... she talked to me for over an hour... glad I was an \"end of the day patient\"... Add to everything else that I have only had 2 cigarettes today... and seeing as I have always been even up to yesterday a pack and a half to 2 pack a day smoker.... I am a wreck... an nervous bunch of energy... bit**y... moody... you name it... but mostly I'm emotionaly exhausted.... I am going to kick this habit... if it kills me or the rest of my household..lol..

My mother was a bingo addict...I remember her heading off with her dabbers...Cancer is not new to my life, however this is the first time I have been dealing with it from the front line. I cared for my brother last year who passed away in my living room from lung cancer he was only 51. My step father several years before him also from lung cancer. My mother is a breast cancer survivor, I only wish she viewed herself that way, rather than a victim. When I heard those words I thought the air had excaped my lungs. Sure is different when it is \"you\". I think that is why I hold on to this group so tight through this.. I choose to be a survivor, and not a mere victim. The influence of this group has been not only inspiring but also helped me to pursue my treatment with a warrior attitude... Yes we can! Hugs & Prayers ~T",
