    "Content": "My real question tonight is about bras. Have left mastectomy and use a regular weight prosthesis. However, during the day the bra band drifts ever so slightly, and slowly, in the diection of the remaining breast. So, after a few hours the strap over the remaining breast is falling down-I pull it up, falling down, etc. The band of the bra drifts so slightly that it is not noticeable to others. I have tried fastening the band tighter, but it ends up difting all the same. Anyone have any ideas? Anyone else have this problem? I go for mammo tomorrow and if a second mastectomy (is recommended, then this may be a moot point. Thanks for all suggestions, Gerry",
