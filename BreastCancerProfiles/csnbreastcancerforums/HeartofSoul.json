      "Content": "I wanted to share this with everyone here in CSN community. This is for everyone who dedicated their time, wisdom, feelings, fears, compassion and support for one another, either as survivors or caregivers. The post below is for breast cancer but also applies equally to each human being diagnosed with cancer and their pricless and indespensible caregivers. Ive seen so many people come to CSN newly diagnosed with cancer who ask for help and soon they reach out to help others. There is a spirit here that brings out the very best in human beings. Most of us have a small inner circle people who are loyal and can be counted upon to be there for us once we get diagnosed with cancer. If were fortunate, our inner circle expands to more than our spouse, child, and parents. Once I step outside my door early in the morning to go to work, im amongst colleagues, strangers, acquaintances, and the general public. On the weekends the only thing that changes is that my co-workers are not in my presence. Since being diagnosed with cancer over 2 and half years ago, I may have been more open about my diagnoses to others beyond the inner circle. Today I think hard and twice about telling anyone about my diagnoses and in fact there are 7 words I do not mention in public or on the phone because of how they are received by others who are not cancer survivors or caregivers. I\u2019m sure you know the body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice of someone who hears the word cancer. First you see their eye lids stop blinking, then they grasp for words but fumble their way to a coherent sentence, and then pivot another direction in a hurried manner. Still others say the right things and appear to care but the next time you hear a \"how are you\" or see them at your front door is the day after forever. I find myself while in public avoiding 7 words that have the power to scatter people like an outbreak of a deadly flu virus. You ask what those 7 words are? The first is Cancer, followed by chemotherapy, radiation, malignancy, tumor, metastasis and oncologist. When I was writing this post to share with others here on CSN, my first thought was to show how cancer can infiltrate our lives, create distance with the world around us and sever the close bonds with those we once called our friends and loved ones. Then without any hesitation, my heart whispered to me in a comforting and reassuring manner. What did my heart say? My heart spoke by holding my hand as he walked beside me with purpose and grace. My heart then took the lead and I followed in his shadows as we walked until we came upon this charming community. This community had this humble but gracious reef of blooming, vibrant flowers as it was held high in the calm blue skies by thousands of supportive hands. Each pair of hands had a human being who softly sung a tune with lyrics that were so touching, I began to cry. At that moment, I realized what my Heart wanted to show me. The name of this community my heart led me to you ask? \"CANCER SURVIVORS NETWORK\" and all of its caring survivors and caregivers who call it their second home. You want to know the name of the song and its precious lyrics that brought tears to my eyes? Its called \"Somewhere\" by Phil Collins lyrics are below and the song done live is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqfNi9BqH94 Lyrics There's a place for us, Somewhere a place for us. Peace and quiet and open air Wait for us Somewhere. There's a time for us, Some day a time for us, Time together with time spare, Time to learn, time to care, Some day! Somewhere. We'll find a new way of living, We'll find a way of forgiving Somewhere . . . There's a place for us, A time and place for us. Hold my hand and we're halfway there. Hold my hand and I'll take you there Somehow, Some day, Somewhere! Heart of Soul, Everybody, Thank you for being here from the bottom of my heart, especially for others.",

      "Content": "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38324215/ns/health-cancer/ Panel wants Avastin withdrawn for breast cancer Health advisers say the popular drug's risks outweigh its benefits A panel of cancer experts said Tuesday that the government should remove its endorsement of Roche's drug Avastin for breast cancer, after follow-up studies failed to show benefits for patients. A Food and Drug Administration panel of experts voted 12-1 in favor of removing the drug's approval for use against breast cancer alongside chemotherapy. The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its panel, though it often does. The negative vote is the first major setback for a blockbuster cancer drug that has racked up approvals for half a dozen forms of the disease. Avastin is also approved for colon, lung, kidney and brain cancer. The panel's ruling only pertains to Avastin's use in breast cancer. The FDA in 2008 approved Avastin for breast cancer patients based on a trial showing it extended the amount of time until the disease worsened by more than five months. The decision was considered controversial by some cancer doctors because the drug had not been shown to extend patients' lives. As a condition of approval, Roche was required to conduct follow-up studies to demonstrate the benefits of adding Avastin to conventional chemotherapy. But two follow-up studies recently submitted by the Swiss drugmaker did not show the same degree of delay in cancer progression as earlier studies. Additionally, patients taking Avastin did not show a significant improvement in lifespan, the gold standard of cancer treatment effectiveness. Roche scientists argued Tuesday that patients taking Avastin experienced improved quality of life as tumor growth and other symptoms are delayed \u2014 but panelists were not convinced. \"The study shows there's very little benefit to patients with significant toxicity risks and no clear survival benefit,\" said Natalie Compagni Portis, the panel's patient representative. Panelists said they worried the drug could do more harm than good because of serious side effects, including high blood pressure, fatigue and abnormal levels of white blood cells. \"I think the burden of proof is that a drug is helpful, not that it doesn't make patients worse,\" said panel chair Dr. Wyndham Wilson of the National Cancer Institute. \"We have definitive evidence that Avastin causes harmful side effects and we've now seen a number of well-done studies that show no advantage to lifespan.\" Breast cancer is the second most-common cause of cancer death among U.S. women, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Last year more than 40,000 deaths in the U.S. were attributed to the disease.",
