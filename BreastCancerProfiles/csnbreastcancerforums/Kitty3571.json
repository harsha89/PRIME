    "Content": "I agree that the most agressive approach is the best - You also have to take your health decisions into your own hands and make sure YOU are getting the best possible treatment choices - Yes, listen to your doctors, of course but also trust your decisions from within and hopefully that will help - In the end I found that even while hitting this beast with all I could, it could still return. I assume you are Her2 because you mentioned Herceptin. That means it's aggressive. I also did the A/C, Taxol & 52 treatments of Herceptin along with 36 of Rads - Unless you experience mets, that is the longest you can remain on Herceptin (thank GOD for Herceptin) As least that is what my ONC told me - Couldn't finish all the Taxol though due to some problems...Plus if I had to do it all over again I might have opted for the mastecomy instead of just a lumpectomy. Now as I just finished treatment and had my port removed last week, I am now falling into the \"worrying if it will come back catagory\"!!! They took only 5 nodes from me during my sentinal node biopsy - It was very tender for a long time. All will get better with time and I will continue to have hope (that always helps) I wish you the best of luck with the rest of your treatments and will pray that your surgery, whatever you decide will go well Kitty",
