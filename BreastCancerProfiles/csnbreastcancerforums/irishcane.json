    "Content": "Hello. I am new to this board. I have a question about Neupogen. I have been having terrible side effects from this medication (i.e. bone pain/headaches). So bad in fact that when my nurse called today to tell me to start another 3 day dose I started to cry. Has anyone ever tried Neulasta? How do the side effects compare to Neupogen? I have a phone appointent with my hematologist tomorrow and I plan to ask her about Neulasta. Any information would be appreciated. Thank you so much.",
