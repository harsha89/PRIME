    "Content": "Hello, I'm a regular on the colorectal board & I have stage IV colorectal cancer. I'm on the breast cancer board now, though, because I know that several of you may be on or have been on Gemzar (gemcitabine). I am in the unusual position of having \"used up\" all the chemos for colorectal cancer and I am now on a combo of Gemzar, 5FU with leucovorin, and Avastin. This was recommended for me to take based on a clinical trial with it for colorectal patients with some decent outcomes. I've now been on it for a year and will be continuing to take it for awhile probably. Anyhow, I have developed something recently that may or may not be related to Gemzar, but I'm thinking it might be. I've experienced the usual side effect of Gemzar with my platelet count going low (although it's been very good lately- totally in the normal range, which I'm very pleased about). What I've experienced lately is similar to something I used to have happen when I was on oxaliplatin- that is, I get a tightening or squeezing effect in my throat when I swallow something, for both food and water. This has just been happening off and on over the past month, with it happening at least half the times that I swallow food or drink this past week since my last chemo infusion. I don't think it's like an allergic reaction or anything, but it's very uncomfortable. It's like when I swallow food or drink it hurts for a few seconds and I have to just wait for the few seconds until it passes. Some of the time the feeling will last for a few minutes. *Have any of you experienced this sensation- either on Gemzar or not? I've already talked to my oncologist and the chemo nurse about it- they both said they haven't heard of this happening to anyone on Gemzar, but I know that it still may be possible that others have experienced it. I'm just wondering if it's related to the chemo or not and what can be done about it. I've been eating less lately because I don't look forward to this sensation. (I'm actually wanting to lose a few more pounds, but would worry if it kept going too much). Any input would be appreciated- thanks! Lisa",
