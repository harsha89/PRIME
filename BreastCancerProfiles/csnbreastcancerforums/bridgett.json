    "Content": "I felt the same way. I was healthy, happy, and I have never been one to be sick. Life was great, and then the awful news right befor x-mas, 12/16/02 they told me it was breast cancer. I was in total shock. No family history, and I am only 28yr old. I kept thinking this is impossible. The year before I had a needle aspiration done and the results were benign, so I waited a year to have the mass removed, thinking it was nothing but a fibroid cyst, it didnt hurt so a year later its removed and I find out its cancer, stage 11. So now I have had 4rds of ac and 3 taxtol, one more to go then a bi=lateral mast.(my own decision), they say I dont need rads, but the more I read, I may ask for them to be extra safe. God Bless All of you Bridgett",
