      "Content": "So many reasons to be thankful, which I am but yet... I am a Stage 1, invasive breast cancer survivor, two years out from surgery, chemo and radiation.  Some side effects aren't going to disappear, sore, sensitve tongue, neuropathy in both feet, and small amount in right hand,  two years into taking the oral anti estrogen medications.  So many reasons to celebrate each day, yet feel that cancer is lurking just over my shoulder and going to strike again at any minute.  I have two very nice wigs, which I really should donate, yet can't even get myself to open the drawer where they are stashed.  Guess, I just feel like I can't let my 'guard down' for even a minute.  I have tried my local support group, just didn't feel like a fit.  At my medical teams suggestion trying this, perhaps one of you has shared the same feelings?  And can offer some better suggestions than, but, you don't have cancer now.
