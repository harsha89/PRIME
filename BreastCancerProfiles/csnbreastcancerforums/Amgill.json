They found that there is an area of tissue growth and they want me back for another MRI in 6 months...I guess they want to watch that area... Thank you everyone for all your help, thoughts and prayers while I walked this scary road! All of you are fighters! I will be praying for all of you!Â  God bless you all! ~Amanda",
