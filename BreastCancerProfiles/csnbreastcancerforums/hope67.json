This waiting has been pretty much hard, sometimes making me wondering if I made the right decision. I feel I had, after having ILC and IDC in one breast I would never feel safe, especially with knowledge that ILC is so hard to detect and that it often goes to the other side. The main reason why the waiting was hard was that it was postponing the end of all my treatments. I want to get this expander out and continue with my life, I want to run again and play pingpong with my son and go on with my normal life as much as I can. I hope nothing unexpected happen until Wednesday. Funny, it seems that I am more worried about canceling of surgery than of surgery itself. I know what to expect and I know it won't be fun. Wish me luck and take care, Carmen ",
