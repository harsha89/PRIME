      "Content": "Butterfly, I would start with the American Cancer Society in your area, they usually have a list of support groups for family members. Their grief is as different as ours is, and they need to vent to. My surgeon's office had a list of resources also, but I had to ask for it. When I asked why it wasn't offered they said everyone is in different stages so when you ask a question they give you the lists(Wigs, support groups, herbals etc.) I suggested that they leave the literature out and available because not everyone will ask.( I see all the info out now!) Hope this helps. Good luck. Know that there are plenty of us out here living after treatment, good full lives. (I ended chemo 5 months ago) Hang in there. Prayers and Hugs! Lynne",

They gave me steroids in the IV for the nausea as well as Zofran. Compazine did nothing for me either. Believe it or not the treatment does go by and pretty soon I hope you will be looking back on it. I ended mine 3 months ago. Hang in there!",

Docs find no apparent reason for this but I now am having a stiff neck also. No reason to believe it is related to the cancer yet I had none of this before my cancer. RN massage therapist says it is stress that the cords in my neck and muscles in my shoulders are as stiff as a board. Has anyone else had these symptoms? Any feedback would be appreciated! Thanks ladies! Lynne",

I got 1/2 the steroid dose and my BS only was its highest at 300, bad but still better than close to 600. How old is your Mom? Any questions about the diabetese feel free to e mail me.

My hair is 2 inches long and I've already colored it. I read on these boards not to but there is no basis for this. Hair is dead material as soon as you see it, and if your hair has come back finer, coloring it will roughen up the cuticle and give it more body. Just my 2 cents worth! Good Luck, Lynne",

I went to the dentist for X-rays and they couldn't see an abcess, but my jaw is tender to the touch and it hurts down into my ear also. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or not. I am 6 months past my last chemo A/C. Thanks Lynne",

For some ladies it goes away others claim they nair it or wax it, Mine has lessened somewhat but it's still not back to \"my normal\". I'm exhausted too. The only answer I've gotten is sometimes when you gain your stamina back and go back to life as before about 6-7 months or so later you get the 2nd wave of exhaustion. Not everyone experiences this but it is common. I noticed that I got my stamina back, started exercising again and life was good. Now I'm exhausted again. Don't know if this helps, but at least you know you're not alone! Hugs, Lynne",
