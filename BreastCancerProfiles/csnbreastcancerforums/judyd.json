I am usually afraid to say anything except on those rare occasions when I have finally had enough. That is usually the time I should have been quiet. Oh well. You are such an inspiration here. Don't know what we would do without your humor & strength here. Have a great day. Judy",

      "Content": "Good morning everyone, first I want to thank you for your prayers for our nieces. I really appreciate it. I talked to my sister-in-law this morning. They did surgery on our great niece yesterday evening to work on her arm & cheekbone again. They will have to go in again tomorrow. Our niece is not doing so well. They are having trouble keeping the fluid off her lungs. Yesterday her heart rate dropped very low twice. They had to give her a shot to get it back up. they checked her legs & feet again, still no feeling there. This is so hard for us all but my sister-in-law is really having a hard time.Our daughter's are within a couple of months of being the same age. I have grandaughters also. I just know her heart is just breaking for them. Please continue to keep them all in your prayers. Thank you. Judy",

I will continue to keep you in my prayers. I definately believe in miracles & we will just keep believing in one for you. I pray that your pain will get better. We don't know when it is going to be our time to go so just keep hanging in there. There is new drugs & new treatments in the works all the time. Love, Judy",
