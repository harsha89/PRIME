      "Content": "Try to stimulate your hair growth by brushing your scalp with a very soft brush and massaging the scalp. My hair was originally staight but came back curly. My surgeon said the curly effect would last about 8 mths and then begin to relax as the effects of the Chemo leaves my body. I enjoyed my change of color and texture and curl. I called it my \"Chemo Permanent\". It is as though the saying \"It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature\" is true. Mother Nature will surprise you when it starts coming back in. Hope this helps. It helped me when I was wishing my hair would grow again. Take care, Susie",

      "Content": "I finished treatment about 9 mths ago and the fatigue was horrible and I was having muscle and joint pain. I went to my Oncologist and was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia which he said was a common side effect of Chemo and Radiation Treatments. He said that the effects should last about 12-18 month or up to 24 mths. and then I should begin to return to my baseline. You might check with your doctor to see if you have these. I hope you get to feeling better. Take care, Susie",
