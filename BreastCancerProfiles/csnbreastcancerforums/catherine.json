    "Content": "Dear Susan: Regarding the sore month and thrush, I suggest that you can eat KIWI fruit 2~3pcs everyday or use 4~5 pcs of orange to make the orange juice. Besides, take 1 tablet of Centrum(complex vitamin) and 1 tablet of Vitamin C(500mg) everyday. All the methods above can improve your discomforts you mentioned. There is a kind of medicine named \"Activan\" can provide you a very sweet sleep. I remember when I took the Chemo Therapy, I can't sleep till midnight or it's very easy to wake up in the midnight. My oncologist perscribed me the \"Activan\", it really works! Activan provides me a very good sleeping quality. I used the above methods to conquer my uncomfortable symdromes, I hope they are also effective to you. Everyting will be fine and the discomforts will go away. I'll pray for you. God is always with you. Love & hug Catherine Chen",
