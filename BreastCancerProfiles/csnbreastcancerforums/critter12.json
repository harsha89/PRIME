      "Content": "i just wanted to say thanks so much for the encouraging words. i sure appreciate every one of them! i will be looking forward to that peace and joy hanging out with me every day. i know this wonderful man who i talk to sometimes. when things are tough he always tells me that God has good things for you and you will see blessings from this. it is nice to know that God is hanging out with you and that He only wants good things for us. today is much better. it is friday which means i get to sleep in tomorrow. that always makes it a good day! i go back to the doc to get \"drained\" again. i usually don't mind, but last time i got a little sick so i am a little nervous but it will be alright. good news is that my \"special\" breast (i read that phrase and really liked it) is getting better so i hope to get back to radation soon so i can be done. hope you all have a great weekend - thanks again critter",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies - I haven't had radation in about 3 weeks because they have been draining my breast - once that gets under control I will finish my radation. I have felt so good this week I kind of dread going back - anyway, this morning I noticed my breast is peeling - icky!!! I don't really know if it is from my breast going from huge back to small (because of the fluid in it) or if it is from the radation. What I do know is yuck and am looking for advice on what to put on her to help her. They had told me at radation No deodrant (can you imagine, I live in TX), no lotions, no shaving, etc... But since I am not in radation at the moment, what do ya'll think? Thanks in advance :) hugs and prayers critter",
