      "Content": "I definitely feel you did the right thing for both your cousin and his daughter. One day she would have to try to live with the fact that she hurt her father when he was defenseless. Not a good way to go through life, I would think. Also, you are amazing to care so much for your cousin. I wish you and your family peace.",

      "Content": "Hi. My oncologist made it very clear that if my onco/dx score was over 18, I would take chemo. I came in at 22. I guess I'm the type to be told what to do. It must be a tough decision. Whatever you decide is what is best for you. I had 4 rounds of chemo, once every three weeks. My hair fell out, and it was no picnic, but totally doable. Good luck and best wishes on your treatment.",

      "Content": "Hi. I had the same cocktail almost 2 yrs ago. I was soooo scared. I think everyone is. I had a port and that was fine. I received Neulasta the day after, and felt just fine until about day 3, so I really can't say if it was the chemo or Neulasta. Even at that, I never had nausea. Had some diarrhea regular as clockwork on day 3 or 4 and had meds for that. All in all, I really did ok. Lost my hair and also had taste issues that got better as time went on. You should come here with each and every question you should have. I thought some of my questions would seem too small, but was never, ever, made to feel that way. Good Luck and Best Wishes on your upcoming wedding.",

I had chemo.  It's been almost 5 yrs and everyone is different, and I'm sure any decission you make will be best for you.  Warmest wishes for a good journey and recovery.",
