      "Content": "It's not uncommon to feel depressed after treatment. I think while you're going through all the surgery, chemo, and radiation, you're just too focused on surviving all that you don't even think. I finished everything except I'll be on letrozole and herceptin indefinitely (stage IV). Got great news on my last PET scan that I was NED, which should have made me ecstatic, but instead, I became depressed. My father passed away about 3 months before my NED news, so my doctor thinks everything just piled up on me and I was overwhelmed. She put me on an antidepressant and it has made all the difference for me. I'm back to being my usual self (with occasional periods of grief missing my Dad, which is normal). Perhaps you should talk to your doctor about getting on an antidepressant.  Hope you get to feeling better soon. Gayle",

      "Content": "I would think you will discuss all your options, mastectomy vs. lumpectomy. Those decisions will be determined by size of tumor, whether there are mets, etc. I originally thought I was going to have a lumpectomy, so started chemo first to try to shrink the tumor. Then we found out I was BRCA2 positive, so both my oncologist and surgical oncologist wanted me to have a mastectomy (I had a mastectomy with reconstruction 20 years earlier for a previous tumor in the other breast). So, once I finished the chemo, I had a mastectomy. ",
