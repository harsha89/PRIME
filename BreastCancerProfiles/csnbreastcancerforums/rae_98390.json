      "Content": "Hi, My name is Cindy. I have found this discussion group so helpful. It is so nice to hear you are doing well. Glad to hear the initial opinion from your doctor is very encouraging. That helps alot to hear encouraging news. :):) It has been two years since I had my right breast removed. I did not find the tube removal really painful. It is a bit uncomfortable but goes quickly and it is so nice not to have the tube there anymore. It took about 5 minutes to have the one tube removed. I will be praying for good news for you on Wednesday. God bless you. Cindy",
