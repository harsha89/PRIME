I voted to go with the established treatments - but if I get to the point that the traditional treatment isn't doing it, I will try it. It is not expensive nor is it difficult. You do have to take the liquid every six hours - even one at night - but she (my chiropractor's wife) says it has taken care of her stage 4 breast cancer. It is called Protocel - it was developed by a chemist. I didn't think I could following the dosing regimen working and all - but you might want to try it. I don't think it is contraindicated with our regular treatment. Check it out. Lori",

I answered there questions honestly - at their level (I have preschoolers through sixth grade). My hair started dropping during the Thanksgiving break - so I came back to school in scarves and hats (I hated the wig!). The kids all wanted to know why I had a hat on. I said, \"I have no hair!\" They were shocked! Some had had experience with cancer patients - and they would relate their story. Many wanted me to take off my hat - but I wasn't quite ready for that. I had pictures from the \"shaving party\" - where we gave me a mohawk, etc. - so I showed the pictures. It was emotionally easier if they said \"Oo Yech!\" to the pictures than to my bald little head! I still get strange looks in the halls - out school has a \"no hat\" policy - but I'm an exception! :) Good luck to you - as others have said - the kids can be quite supportive and kind. Lori",

I've had a twinge here or there . . but nothing at all to complain about. I am lucky enough to have a couple of cancer centers around here - so they found me one closer to my home than where I get my infusions . . .so it made that part easy. Sorry to hear that your little one is getting sick. I guess we have to be so careful. I just sent my principal an email. I'm proposing sending a letter home to my students' parents explaining the situation, and telling them that I will have masks and hand sanitizer in my room. If there child comes to speech class with a cough, dripping nose, etc., I will give them the option to wear a mask or go back to class until they feel better. We'll see what she says. I think it sounds reasonable. It would be hard for me to wear the mask - I have to model their speech sounds! I'm feeling fortunate - keeping my fingers crossed! Lori",

      "Content": "No Kathy - I'm right there with you. I looked into some natural or alternative remedies - but either wasn't sure I could comply with the regimens or trust that they really worked - and fearing that if I didn't do this whole chemo/rads/tamxafen thing I would be risking my future with my daughter. So I have decided to do a combo thing. Tomorrow I am going to see a naturalist who does Meridian Stress Analysis who says they can support me with homeopathic means to help my immune system improve and withstand all this other stuff. There are others who have been helped - the hard thing is that the medical establishment can give you facts, figures, studies, thousands of people having gone through it and X amount came out X - whereas the naturalists are one of here and there - no large studies that show long term benefit. . .I think that is what got me. I guess there is no one way - no right way - we each follow our path. I agree that the Dr.s I have are sincere and are not out to do this just for $$$. But I can't help thinking that somewhere up in the AMA and definitely the drug companies, there are people who would squash things that weren't conducive to their bottom line. . .just how is one to know! It could drive you crazy. So we each have to go with what our inner voice tells us and be positive and channel all good things. That's my approach anyway! Lori",
