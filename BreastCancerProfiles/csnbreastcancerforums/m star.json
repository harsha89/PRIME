I never lost my hair with my chemo and i had 6 months of it for HL! Good job i never got moni buzzed in advance!!! lol Also,a good hairdresser will give you a nice,short,trendy style as opposed to a manly buzzcut if you ask them. We have done it on numerous occasions at the salon i work in.It helps maintain some femininity while still taking control of things.",

You can find plenty of info on it online if you do a search. I wanted to start it up again but i have been on Thyroxine for the last 2 years and the pharmasist said you shouldnt eat grapefruit or drink the juice when on thyroxine as it can prevent it from working properly. Having said that,i bought some yesterday (first time in 5 years) and i ate half a tin 1 1/2 hours after my tablet this morning.But i think i may switch to eating it at lunch to give my tablet time to absorb first. Bye the way,when i asked my Dr about grapefruit interaction with drugs he said there was none! You really need to ask a pharmacist as they know more about the drug than a Dr. good luck",

Yes i hear you cannot eat it if you take Warfarin or other blood thinners too. I am just trying the grapefruit again slowly as i've gained a few pounds since being off work with my surgery. I think for me,it will be a short term thing.Once i lose weight it stays off pretty well but i find it real hard to lose it. I think i will move to eating it before lunch and dinner rather than breakfast when i take my thyroxine. But the rest of my diet will remain the same.I dont do the 'proper',800 cals a day diet as its ridiculous and unhealthy.",

I found if i tried to sleep on mt back,not only did it hurt my lower back,but i used to end up rolling onto my sides again anyway. The firm pillow behind the knees really helps, It stops me rolling over and it pushes the small of my back into the bed more-re-aligning my spine so i dont wake up with a bad back. I also found that with laying on my side,my hips and pelvis suffered alot of pain. If you really cant sleep on your back and have to sleep on your side,again,put a firm pillow between your knees to keep your pelvis aligned. I know its more the drugs that are causing your pains,but it may help a bit by altering your sleeping posistion and trying the pillows. I too have cried in the night cus i've been in so much pain. I usually sit it out too as i hate taking pain med's unless its unbearable. Hope you find a solution soon (((Hugs)))",

I dont have alot of skin to stretch as i had very small boobs anyway,but it does feel tight after an exoansion. I've had 3 up to now and if i'm honest.its got more unconfortable each time. I went every 3 weeks but its only 2 between my last one and next one.I had 60ml in each side in the 2nd and 3rd expansions. Not sure if a can hack 60ml on my 4th one. Had 3rd one done last thursday and its still tight and the chest muscle under the whole expander is sore. Pulling myself up out of bed hurts,but its easing up slowly. It may be that im nearing the end of my expansions if i wont stretch much more. Taking pain med's helps and something to relax your muscles before bedtime for a night or two after a top-up will help.I take a Codeine pill. If you are still having problems getting out of bed,instead of straining and pulling yourself up,roll onto your side a bit and roll out of bed almost! best of luck",

Have they checked you for infection?? In the Uk, drains HAVE to be taken out 7 days post-op cus of causing infection inside the surgery site. Even on my 7th day,i was still draining about 25 ml but the body will absorb any excess and it was better the drains were out. Once those drains are out you will be amazed how much better you feel. seriously. both physically and psychologically. Hang in there.I know its tough as im only 7 weeks post-op myself.I would def question the amount of pain you are still in at this point though. It may be that you are doing too much and this is hindering your healing time.If you are doing too much with your arms and upper body,the drainage tubes may be moving around inside too much and preventing the tissue from healing, hence, stopping the raw tissue from mending.This may also be why you are still draining. If you're not happy with your surgeon/MD, change them You're health needs to came first. wishing you all the best xoxo",

Thats the only thing that puts me off a little. I want to never wear a bra again so the no-nip thing is appealing. But then to look like a 'normal' breast when im in the buff,i need nips!

The lady asked me if i would be willing to take part in some voluntary research they were doind and i agreed. Before the surgery,i had to have my arms measured using a machine which takes images and 'draws' up a computerised image of your arm,along with all the vital measurements. I also had to have an electrode put on 1 foot and both hands. An electric current (which you don't feel) is passed through your body and times are recorded as to how lond it takes the current to pass around your body. Then i have my middle finger circumference, and all 4 fingers circumference measured. Each time i go back,i have all three of the above tests done. As some of you may know,i have been videoing my expansions,and so when i went last week,thought it may be useful to also video the lymphedema testing. I had to upload them to youtube in order to get links for them. If anyone is interested in seeing the UK's research,please feel free to take a look. (**apologies for the shaky camera work! It was my daughter doing the video's!) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFfvdgr-ex4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxCZsKzbGbc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltiYhHWEbhs I think you'll have to copy and paste into your browser as im not sure how to create a direct link.
