    "Content": "OK, so I got my purple power port this past Wednesday and I go for my first chemo treatment this Thursday. To say that all of this has been going quickly would be an understatement. And I'm just bursting with questions. I have all my meds for home set up, including clairitin, numbing cream for my port, 2 anti-nausea meds and some good old Klonopin (because honestly my nerves are shot) Does anyone have any other suggestions for me? Luckily I have 2 daughters (18 and 14) who are amazing helpers around the house, so that's not a major concern for me. I do plan on trying to work as much as possible (desk job and I've been cleared to work from home as much as I need) But I honestly NEED to work, not just for the income but to be able to take my mind off all of this, even if just for a few hours.  What if anything will I be able to do during the chemo infusion? I'm getting dose-dense AC every other week and the nurse said it should take a little over an hour each time. Are the meds going to hurt going in to the port? Will I feel sick instantly or will it be the next day or so? for the neulasta, we're doing the on-pro delivery that attaches to my arm and then injects it later on a timer, so that I don't have to go back to the clinic the next day. Has anyone else used that, how was it? also, I have had a deep vein blood clot 17 years ago resulting in my having a vena cava implant - I'm going to give myself lovenox injections during the chemo treatment in order to hopefully head off any possible blood clots forming. Has anyone else had to do this or have experience with this?   ",
