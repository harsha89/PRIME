    "Content": "I finished 4 rounds of Ac which was a nightmare for me. I am now doing 12eeks of taxol which i have finished 3 tratments so far, they premedicate you with meds to decrease allergic reactions. I received decadron, pepcid, and benadryl IV. I have had no allergic reaction. I have been having some joint bain 3 days after treatment and lasting for 3 days. My onc prescrbe me a non narcotic drug called Tramadol which is wroking great so far. Taxol is so much eaiser then Ac. I can make it thru these next 9 weeks alot better then I could have with Ac. The only thing is I get very sleep during treatment with the Benadryl but when its over I am refreshed and had a nice nap during the trearment.",
