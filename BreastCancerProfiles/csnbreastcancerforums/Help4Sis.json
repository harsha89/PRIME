      "Content": "Has anyone here had any luck getting approval to be treated in an out-of-network cancer center? My sister was (2nd sister in 10 years) diagnosed last month. Is trying to get treatment in an out-of-network center with WAY more experience than the local or other in-network centers. Is she just chasing her tail? Or can she actually win this appeal? Thanks in advance!",

Onc said he won't worry about it until it reaches the 1000 (1 million) mark. Has anyone experienced this and what was done for it? Thanks.",
