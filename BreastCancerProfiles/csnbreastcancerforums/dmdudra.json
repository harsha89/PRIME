      "Content": "Dear Eil, I know what you are talking about I started chemo treatment in January of this year and for me to get a good nights sleep is next to impossible. I got a total of 3 hours last night. I have so much going on my my head at night that it is hard for me to relax. Like how the heck am I going to afford to pay all these bills. When I am a single mom and trying to get caught up on the bills I am behind? Also do I have enough life insurance if things do not turn out good? Also should I maybe at age 46 think about having a will drawn up? and who should be in charge of my estate if something does go wrong?? I am hoping that when all this is over in July I might get a full nights sleep. If not then I am going to take some relaxation classes. I wish you well and no offense but maybe seeing a therapist might help.. take care and I wish you luck.. D",
