    "Content": "Hello everybody. I am new to this forum, so please forgive me if I might not be clear on everything. I am looking for an oncologist for the second opinion. I have been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. Had my chemo, mastectomy, more chemo, and radiation. I was good on femara and Lupron for 3 years till they found \u201cold\u201d cells on a tip of my lung last November. I had a biopsy on those cells, and they proved to be cancerous. But they were negative for HER2 and estrogen (while my original cancer was positive for both). My doctor decided that they did not get enough fluid for the biopsy and they considered that this is but a new cancer, but rather old cells that survived. My femara medication was changed to herceptine and faslodex. More PET scan followed to see if the new medication works. I got scan back in February that said that the cells are growing. I had a cold prior to the scan, but my doctor said it does not matter. After I got the results, I did some research and realized that it does matter. So, I asked for another scan. I got it last week. It was a CAT scan instead of PET. It was compared to the scan I had even before my chemo started and it shown no changes. I asked my doctor what it means with the biopcy and all. She was explaining something, but the main line is that she would not change my new treatment. But I don\u2019t even know if I need this treatment or need femara. Or maybe they are new cells, not old. Please, if you know a good, thinking doctor who can help me out to understand all this, please let me know. I leave in NY. My doctor is in Memorial Sloan Kettering, so I cannot have another doctor there. But anywhere else is fine. Thank you all",
