    "Content": "I had reconstruction of both breast 3 years ago June 30. I am still having a lot of pain around my breast and around my back. I have been to several Drs here and no one has had a patient with the same symptoms.They have no answers so I have to take pills to help with the pain.I don't want to take pills forever. Has anyone experienced anything similar? I am desperate.",
