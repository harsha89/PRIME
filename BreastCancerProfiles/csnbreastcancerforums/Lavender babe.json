    "Content": "Greetings all, just joined this network and wanted to introduce myself and tell my story. It has been 10 months today that I had a lumpectomy for triple positive, stage II, class III breast cancer.  A PET scan showed that the cancer had not metastasized anywhere else in my body.  The biopsy on the removed tumor indicated that there was LVI, which meant that it was systemic. The pathologist did discover that I actually had two tumors in one.  Inside the IDC tumor was a DCIS tumor. The lumpectomy did not include any lymph node dissection or removal and I chose not to undergo the \"standard of care\"; chemo, radiation or drug therapy. I am cancer free today and have been since at least January (two months post surgery). When faced with cancer of any type each and every one of us has our own choice as to how we proceed, and I would like to say first and foremost that I honor everyone's choice and clearly realize that the path I took and continue to take is not for everyone. I had made the choice long before diagnosis if I ever had any kind of cancer diagnosis that I would not follow traditional treatment because I know my body and how it reacts to normal drugs; not good or \"normal\". Upon receiving the diagnosis my husband and I went into heavy research mode.  We are talking hours upon hours on the computer.  As someone certified in nutrition and lifestyle counseling I had a pretty good idea where to begin.  It was with a raw food diet.  I had \"tried\" it before, but without the motivation I simply could not stick to it. I proceeded to immediately cut out ALL processed foods, sugars; even natural and gave up my very dear friend wine!  Raw for 45 days was honestly no simple task, especially when considering I had the lumpectomy three days before Thanksgiving.  I made it through \"turkey day\", Christmas and New Year's quite nicely.  I was rewarded with cancer markers in the low 20's on all five tests on January 20, 2013, just two months post surgery. I did not follow any diet or protocol, I made one that worked for me, based on hour upon hour of research.  I did coffee enemas for 30 days; which I feel was highly important.  The dead cancer cells must be removed from the body as quickly as possible, this cleans the blood as well as the liver and bowels very effectively.  It is easy, and once you get over the mental/emotional conditioning of your your rear end being off limits is not any different than cleaning every other part of your body.  I used a far-infrared sauna three times a week, started exercising daily, meditated and put my faith in God to deliver on His healing promises. After discontinuing the raw food I became a vegan and still am to this day, and expect I always will be.  Happily so! I believe my continued health depends on this lifestyle.  I love the way I eat now, granted I have had daydream moments of being like everyone else again, but it just isn't going to happen. I am always astounded by people who tell me; I could never give up.... chocolate, beef, whatever.  The bottom line is, it is a choice.  You can give up anything and everything you want if you want it enough.  The quality of my life is so much more important to me than any food I could ever imagine eating. I have the same scary moments, hours, days that everyone else has about recurrence and then I remember that we have been conditioned to think this way and I generally shrug the doubts and fears off fairly quickly.  Life is one day at a time and sometimes even one minute at a time.  Someone is always more than willing to try and scare the bejesus out of me, but I always have the choice of what I will believe.  I believe most of what we have been told, taught and conditioned to think about cancer is a lie.  If we take responsibility for our own health and how we treat our bodies they have been created to heal themselves.",
