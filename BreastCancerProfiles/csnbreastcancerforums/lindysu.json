    "Content": "hello, the body is an incredible instrumant that has been designed to heal itself.Most reserchers believe that we have microscopic cancer-causing carcinogens in our bodies all the time but our immune system attacks them and eliminates them.When our immune system is depressed or in a weakened state is when they think it gets out of control and a cancer developes. the chemotherapy will not eliminate all the microscopic cancer cells in our body, the goal is to eliminate it to such a degree that our own immune system can take care of whats left. So after chemo the best course of action is to do all you can to boost your own immune system and keep it healthy. your doctor was right about having happy thoughts, because reserch shows that negativity, stress, anger,depression, etc. have negative effects on your immune system...while laughter,love, and letting go have been proven to boost your immune system. exercise has been proven to improve ones immune system...there are many things you can do to improve your health and participate in your own wellness.there are many cancer fighting foods and vitamins etc. that you can suppliment your diet with, along with meditation and other stress reducing therapys. Just finding joy in life and loving what you do can heal a weak immune system...you don't have to stand by and helplessly wait... you have the power within you to make a difference in the outcome. get some good books on keeping your immune system healthy, read some of bernie siegals books like love,miracles and medicine,it feels good to feel like you are doing something to fight back....love lindy",
