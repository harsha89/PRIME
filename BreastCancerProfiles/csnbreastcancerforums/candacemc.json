    "Content": "I am finally arming myself with bits of information about my situation. I froze at diagnosis and stayed that way til now. Here's my question: I had a double mastectomy (one radical with the loss of 8 or 9-jeez lymph nodes that were all clean) at the first sign that one breast had 2 microscopic calcification crystal based tumors. The sum was less than Stage 1. The other breast removal was recommended as a prophylactic measure. Since mast. I have had a full body scan of organs, bone scan (both clear) and the genomics test that showed I have an 8% chance of reoccurence. HOW is that possible if I have no breasts/tissue/skin? WHY do I have to take Tamox for 5 years if I have no breasts? One last bit of information --- I had my first mammogram (the one this year) at 45 years of age. I had gone 13 years without a pap smear, but have never and still don't have any problems in that area of my body. However, the doc used the 13 year period as the reason that my \"breast cancer could have jumped the lymph nodes and went straight into my blood stream\". Sooo... does this mean that it can live dormant somewhere else in my body for a while and then reappear as a secondary cancer? What am I missing here? Every single doc that I have seen (and I love them all, in the Houston Med Center) recommended that I have the double mast. to \"end the drama\". So, I took this drastic measure to now find out that the drama will never end?? I cannot wait to meet with my onc to get these questions answered.",
