      "Content": "hahahahaha I had bi-lat 2/16/2011. For a while I would type breast instead of best, tit instead of it, etc. Let's face it - our society is SUPER breast oriented and tells us in movies, TV, print ads that feminine beauty is defined by our breasts. That is not actually TRUE, however! They are simply the most obvious physical representation of our femininity. You know, I hope, that you are so much more than breasts! chin up, hon - you're on the right side of the grass! Melanie",

      "Content": "I had done some extra physical labor Saturday so initially I put down to muscle strain some pain I felt Sunday morning. I ached ALL over my body so that made sense. As the day progressed I was FREEZING and just felt bad. I came home from church and decided to lay down for a while, took some tylenol about 3:30 and woke up at 5 pm. I felt bad enough that I didn't even take a shower and I went to bed about 8:30! Some of you may understand (may?)-- I don't really look at the bi-lateral mastectomy site unnecessarily but I did yesterday and while I had thought it felt inflamed Sunday - and I really felt too tired to think - it WAS inflamed! My left site (what the heck do you call it???) is reddened, swollen, inflamed and tender. I called my GP and he wants me to come in today. The left side is where I have my port, but it is higher up - about 1 1/2 inches below my collar bone, and it looks fine. This is weird!! Obviously, I should have more to report later this afternoon. I'm just wondering if this will mean I need to postpone my scheduled Herceptin infusion Thursday? I only have two left!!",

      "Content": "In addition to the excellent advice given by other responders, you may have hypersensitivity of your nerve endings. My wonderful lymphedema specialist advised me that treatment of both hypersensitivity and hypo-sensitivity (lack of feeling) are the same; gentle (and I do mean gentle) stimulation by lightly stroking the area from right to left ideally with four different textures for 30 seconds each. For example, 30 seconds with your fingertips, 30 seconds with a feather, 30 seconds with a dry washcloth, 30 seconds with a damp washcloth. No extreme in sensation or temperature (avoid heat or ice). Do this several times a day. It will not instantly get better. It will, however, get better.",

      "Content": "My understanding about Herceptin was you take it for a full year of treatment (I was Taxotere, Carboplatin & Herceptin) and that was the full amount of it. You might want to go to herceptin.com and there you can find out more about it. They will even send you a kit that has information about Herceptin treatment - free. I wouldn't think you would take Herceptin indefinitely as it does cause damage to the heart. This is recoverable, but for a lifetime?? Now I WAS told at Moffitt Cancer Hospital that I would take Arimidex (or one of several other drugs) for at least 5 years and that new studies indicate that it would be wise to take them for the rest of your life. Arimidex, by the way costs $200 a month and above except at Costco where it is $20.79 a month. You do NOT have to be a Costco member to use their pharmacy. Good research, girl, and good luck. I finish my Herceptin at the end of March. WOO-HOO!",
