No family history of breast CA. I have a daughter who is 20, her insurance will pay for her to have a mammo now that I have a dx of breast CA. Your right some PCP will not order a mammo before 40. Thats an idea for women, say they felt something or complain of breast pain. Deb",

Ive just began chemo, my onc says mastectomy will come after I finish chemo. My lump is very large (PET scan says 10cm)with liver mets. I fear that what if the chemo doesnt work and cancer also spreads to my lungs, ribs. Thanks for your input. Prayers to all. Deb",
