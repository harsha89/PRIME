I still dance for exercise but I changed dance styles. I do stepping, line dancing and salsa. One of my instructors gave me the name Ballerina because she got tired of telling me to get off half point when I should have been dancing with bent knees.",

My breasts look wonderful. I am 54 and my breast look 23, per husband and friends. I'm not bashful. However, if you do reconstruction make sure you have a great surgeon do lots of research. Best of luck to you.",
