You will find a great deal of love and support on this site. There are women here that have gone thru the gamut of treatments/therapy. There are number of survivors that post regularly as well as some spouses (which is wonderful!). The beauty of this site is that the women here understand that each of us makes the decisions about treatment that are right for them. You will find posts from women who have decided not to have recommended treatments/meds. I don't have a lot of answers, but I did want to welcome you to the site and let you know that you will find support here. You may want to post where you live, in case someone in your area does know of an evening support group. God Bless... Julie",

It was also negative! Thought possible chemo in my future, but he assures me that the tumor was so small, oncologist will not give me chemo! I had my simulation done yesterday and expect to start next week. Will have 30 + 5. I'm thanking God for his blessings thru this. I've been fortunate to be able to march right thru the process and haven't had to wait as long as others on this site to just begin the process (diagnosis received 12 Nov). I'm still working thru the process emotionally, but am certainly feeling blessed and thankful. I appreciate all the posts and am comforted that I can come to read and share and know that others have been where I am. Julie",

Remember to just take one day at a time and realize that everyone reacts differently to the radiation. My simulation wasn't all that long, though i planned for at least an hour...felt like i was in and out though they did the CT scan and i got my tats! I had read about casts, but didn't require of those either. Hopefully, the sim will go quickly and you'll be done w/rads in no time. Do a search for radiation questions and answers for a string w/lots of good info! Remember...lots of lotions!!! Blessings... Julie",

I agree w/the comment about open communication, though you definitely need to consider time/place and circumstance. I found this website in one of the many brochures i received after my diagnosis. I shared it with my husband, though don't know if he really spent any time there.

There are women who opt for different types of treatment and how far they want to go. Take your time w/big decisions and make sure you are well informed before hand.
