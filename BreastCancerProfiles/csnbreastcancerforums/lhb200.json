    "Content": "My surgery has not been scheduled as of this date, but will probably be next week. I have had all the test and am ready for the mastcetomy and reconstruction. I chose to have immediate reconstruction. I felt if it had been a double I probably would not have had reconstruction but with a single I chose reconstruction. I had a lumpectomy and lymp node extraction in 2004 and the cancer returned in the same breast last month. I had cemo and radition. This was such a surprise for my oncologist and myself after 6 years of no signs of the cancer returning. But, we do what we have to do. I am so sorry about your condition. It does hurt to know we are losing a part of our body and to me I feel like this is a monster in my body that I despise and want gone!! I feel violated and out of control. I am a Christian and believe God will heal me and that is where I put my trust and that is where I draw my strength. If I can be of any help to you please feel free to cry on my shoulder. We can get through this together!! please keep in touch and since our surgeries are so close together. We can talk each other through the rough times!! LInda",
