      "Content": "I was taken to the hospital. I started to have seizures, in and out of consiousness, vomiting, diareah. I couldn't speak, couldn't understand what others were saying, blurry vision. Memory loss, it took a few minutes to know who my husband was. My skin started to peel off, and finger nails were coming off. Couldn't stand, it felt like something was crawling thru my body. I thought I was going to die. My dr. gave me a break, and wanted to try again this time with half the dose. Heck NO! I refused Taxatere. Told her to order a PET Scan I was done with chemo, no more! The lump was no longer in breast. Took PET and it came back ALL clear. No signs of cancer. I still had surgery, lumpectomy, followed by radiation.",
