      "Content": "I would ask your surgeon to contact your oncologist to discuss the course of action. You are the customer and should feel comfortable and informed about what they are doing to your body. A re-do isn't really an option. I would think you might even be able to set up a conference call...where you could be on one end too. Jenn",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I've just had my 2nd round of chemo and am feeling down. I am trying to be positive,but I just feel blah. I'm also on my period and it's a gloomy day. The new anti-nausea meds are helping, but I feel tired and sleep all the time. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather sleep than be sick. Yet, I feel like I'm missing everything. My kids are quiet, not talking a lot, and I know they are affected by my health. Also, I keep thinking about the what if's. I know...nothing in life is certain...but I just hate the thought of going through this again some day. I know many of you are in this boat, and don't know how you manage day to day. I have a very supportive family and friend network, lots to be happy about, but just feel blah. Jen",

Everything was fine though...and I asked to have the doctor palpitate on the mastectomy side...even though my onc. does it too. I guess it just made me feel better to have another set of hands checking. Let me know how things went. Jenn",
