    "Content": "Chessie, interestingly enough, I have also noticed a bit more bruising than normal on my legs since I started on tamoxifen a couple of months ago. AND, I developed a rash (raised bumps, but unlike you, itchy) on my legs a week ago. As of today the rash has started to clear up, so that is good. I have not been exposed to anything different in my life, so the only thing I can equate it to is the tamoxifen. The bruising may just be from the \"holiday rush\" of shopping and bumping! However, I have an onc appointment soon, and will discuss at that time as they both should be reported. I agree with Ink to contact your doctor sooner than a month away to make sure all is well. Wishes for a safe, happy, healthy New Year.... Kathy",
