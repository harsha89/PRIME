      "Content": "I went to Kroger's the other day to buy toilet paper and seen Quilted Northern is donating $.50 of your purchase to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. I thought that was great. Then I go up front to check out and seen the new pink and white M&M's also. I purchased both. I wish the companies good do better, but I know they are to make a profit as well so something is better than nothing.",
