    "Content": "Hello Sylva, I'm new to this site and wanted to share my experience. I had Breast Cancer 12 years ago and have been cancer free since Thank God. I have had my share of scares. In July of 2008 I was helping to lift my mother and pulled a muscle in my chest (pectoral muscle). Went to my doctor and he did an MRI to see if I tore the muscle, but found a mass under my arm where I had the cancer. I had 9 nodes removed but only 1 was infected. No mastectomy. Chemo and Radiation. Well, he sent me for a Pet scan and it was hot where they saw the mass under my arm, so they removed it. It was benign scar tissue. Then March 2009 I was having pain again so they did another pet scan and the mass came back under my arm twice the size and it was hot. My doctors felt it was the same scar tissue because this type grows back, but to be safe my doctor removed it, and again it was scar tissue, both time benign. He said this type of scar tissue has large benign cells that always show up on a pet scan. Well, I went back last week because my arm (I have lympedema) was more swollen than usual so they did a doppler to make sure I didn't have blood clot, and behold, no blood clot, but another mass bigger than the second one that was removed. Another Pet Scan last week showed it was hot again and larger. My oncology doctor says he does not think it's cancer, he thinks its the same scar tissue but I have to see my surgeon next week. He said this is an aggresive scar tissue that grows back fast and bigger each time they do surgery, but they haven't been able to get it all because it's attached to the main artery in my arm. He said as aggresive as it is, if it was cancer, it would be showing up in other parts of my body, which it isn't Thank God. All three times it's only shown hot in the same place. I just hope they can figure out how to stop it from growing. I'm hoping my doc is right and it's just scar tissue again. Of course I won't feel great until they take it out again and biopsy it, but I can't keep going for surgery every 8 months. Has anyone else out there ever heard of this happening? Thank you for listening, Anne",
