      "Content": "Dear Trav - I want to also encourage you to check out ALL your options before making a decision. There are some great websites that explain the various tissue transfer surgeries -- if you have trouble finding them, feel free to email me and I will drag some of the websites to my reply to get you going. I also encourage you to go to the DiepSisters website -- there they maintain a list of recommended (by happy patients) drs all over the country who successfully do the tissue transfer surgeries. Perhaps you will find other drs who will tell you that you can have a DIEP or GAP (both of which are less invasive, have less complications and are easier to recover from) instead of a TRAM. Remember that it is generally best to take your time, research out everything you can and ask every question (there is no dumb question when you are considering surgery). Regards, Linda",

      "Content": "Other help is: 1 - trigger point massage which you can do for yourself with tennis balls or high-density or high bounce rubber balls (there are a number of books that show you how -- I can look them up if you need them) -- you may need to check on adjustments for your lymphedema but I would think this still can help you as most of the pressure points are in the neck and upper back/chest area if I remember correctly -- to reach the muscles on your upper back/neck you put the ball in a knee sock and sling it over your shoulder 2 - epsom salt baths -- long soaks 3 - not carrying a shoulder purse anymore 4 - resting your arms on arm/bedrests as much as possible when sitting 5 - doing gentle stretching exercises after warming up the muscles (with a heat pad -- see #6) -- there are several websites that list exercises for the muscle groups of the shoulder/upper back/neck that are very helpful 6 - using heating pads to get the tightness out of the muscles followed by cold pads for pain before sleep (you will need to buy 2 so you can do both hot & cold) 7 - sleeping on the \"good\" side with a foam pillow between your legs to take pressure off the bad shoulder/neck area 8 - not using your arms for anything strenuous -- have someone else push the vacuum, move the furniture, lift heavy things I have similar troubles that have worsened and must remove my implants. I hope your troubles do not progress to such an extent. It is important to have a doctor who listens to/takes your complaints seriously. If you continue to have trouble and want more tips, feel free to email me. I hope you get relief soon.",
