    "Content": "I can so relate. My border collie was just short of his 15th birthday last summer when he had a stroke. I had hopes that he would recover, but after 5 days of watching him not being able to get up, taking him outside by pulling his rug out the door and using a sling to get him up to go to the bathroom and several trips to the vet I put on my big girl panties and stayed with him while the vet put him down. I'm glad I had those last minutes with him looking in my eyes, but it was sooooo hard! Then 2 days later I had biopsies done and the rest is history. I'm thinking it may be time for another dog, but haven't quite gotten there yet.",
