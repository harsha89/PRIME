      "Content": "I had a double mastectomy with implant reconstruction on April 29.   The implant reconstruction means that the surgeon placed what are called \"expanders\" under my chest muscle wall.   Once you are over the surgery, you will get \"fillups\" of saline to expand the expanders.   This stretches out the skin.    Somewhere down the road, you will have another sugery to get your \"real\" implants.  Some ladies have the surgery where your own tissue is used instead of implants.  I have to have that surgery since I am having to go through radiation after my chemo. Let me tell you - the April 29 surgery was no picnic.  I won't lie - it was painful.   If you take your pain meds, you will be fine.....just make sure you eat something before you take your pain meds......  After about 4-5 weeks post-op, most of the pain was gone.   The first few weeks are the hardest. That oncologist had to have been making an attempt at sarcastic humor.  This surgery was not fun but I wouldn't consider it unbearable either.... Good Luck  :O)",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am interested in hearing your opinions on swimming in public and/or private pools while you are a chemo patient?   What has your oncologist said and have you had a bad experience after swimming in a public pool?   I know about the issue with direct sunlight.   I would have an umbrella for that.  I just wanted to know about being in the water or not?   Thanks so much!    ",
