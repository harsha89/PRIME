      "Content": "I too have had bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction started. It is not that bad. You do need to take it easy for a while and not try to do too much. Your body will definately tell you when you have. The drains are the worst but if all goes well are not in too long. The tissue expanders are a little uncomfortable for me but it gets better each day. I wish you all the luck with your surgery and hope that it will be easy for you.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with DCIS in right breast in March. Had double mastectomy in April with reconstruction (preventive for left breast). I will be doing my exchange in a couple of months. I was so lucky that I was in stage 0 and not invasive so therefore I have not had to have any treatments of chemo or radiation. So someone asked me the other day a very good question. Do I say I \"have\" or I \"had\" cancer?",
