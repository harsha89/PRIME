    "Content": "My oncologist has prescribed Arimidex for me following lumpectomy and radiation.  I am 68 years old and my breast tumor was Stage 1 Grade 2 with no lymph node involvement and wide margins.  I have rheumatoid arthritis and also osteopenia.  The oncologist gave me a grace period before I needed to begin the medication, but the time has now arrived.  Are there others that have been scared to begin because of SE and if so, how did you get over your fear?",
