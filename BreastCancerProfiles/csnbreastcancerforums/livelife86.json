    "Content": "Hi Just thought I would add my current experience. i had HL in 1989 and 2003, half mantle radiation in 1989 and ABVD in 2003. I now have grade 3 stage 3 breast cancer. I have had a mastectomy am having chemo but am also having some radiotherapy as there was no clear margin to the tissue that they removed.The initial plan was for no raditherapy. With my 2003 relapse of HL my tumours reduced by more than 50% but did not disapper- the decision was made to not radiate the main one as it was too near my spinal cord- these tumours have been in active since but one of them turned out to be breast cancer and was not treated or investigated as it wsa presumed that it was one of these inactive lymphoma sites- that had calcified. i have read about another person with a similar experience on this site. A prophylactic mastectomy is planned for the other side.",
