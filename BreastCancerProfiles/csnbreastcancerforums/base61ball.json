      "Content": "Chris, contact the American Cancer Society and the social worker at the hospital where you had your treatment. There are several agencies that can get you some help but you have to apply. It takes some work and time on the phone, but apply for absolutely everything you can. My heart goes out to you - things are tough for me too and its a struggle but you can get through it. This is the right place for support and help.",

      "Content": "My biggest fear is that I will be unable to work. I have scheduled my treatments for late Thursday afternoon. From what I understand, Friday I will be tired, Saturday more so. Since I live alone, my job is crucial to my survival - some of the blogs talk about taking a lot of time off from the treatment - my job won't sustain this (small co doesnt fall under the federal rules) and I don't get paid if I don't work - anyone else out there in the same predicament? I had lumpectomy and 14 lymph nodes removed 9 were cancerous. Peripherals were clear. Will have 4 c/a treatments 2 weeks apart, then the toxitere 4 treatments 2 weeks apart, followed by 6-1/2 weeks radiation m-f. After that, I intend to rent myself out as a night light as I am certain I will glow in the dark! Thanks for listening.",
