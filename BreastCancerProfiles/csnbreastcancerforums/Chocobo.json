    "Content": "The neulasta was horribly painful for me 3 or 4 days after the chemo. They will take you to take claritin to help the bone pain. It does a bit but in my case not a lot. If you're prone to bone pain (if you're young it's usually worse, im 32) ask them to prescribe some real anti pain meds like tramadol, just in case. Also, one thing that works great against that pain (at least it did for me) is CBD oil (endoca is a good brand).",
