    "Content": "I'm really at a loss as to what to do/think....I found out in February that there were sclerotic legions on my 4th and 5th ribs. This is the same lump that I mentioned in my other thread. Apparently they showed up in Decembers CT scan but I wasn't told about them till I went to the ER in February. I've been told by my oncologist for the last 3 months that he wants to do a biopsy on them. When I last saw the thoracic surgeon she didn't mention them (I had had both a CT scan and a bone scan)and since then my oncologist has been trying to get a hold of her but she doesn't respond. Considering I've had cancer twice in less than 3 years one would think that they'd move a little faster....because of this thoracic surgeon I didn't get a cancer diagnosis for 3 months because they didn't get the a mammogram booked till July/09 and I had last seen her @ the end of April/09 (she figured what she saw on the CT scan was silicone so didn't push for an earlier mammogram.... Today I saw my oncologist and he noticed it had gotten bigger but again said he wants to do a biopsy....I'm in pain all the time because my family dr doesn't want me to take more than 2 percocets a day....I feel like no one is listening to me.....and are just giving me the brush off. I'm so tired of all this.....and feel like giving up......",
