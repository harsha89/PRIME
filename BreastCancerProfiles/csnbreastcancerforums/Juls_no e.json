    "Content": "hi everyone. I am looking for what to expect from the 4 rounds of chemo I will be starting on Friday. I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, no node involvement about a month ago. I also have Multiple Sclerosis, and Neulasta is not being ordered because of that. Any ideas on what/when I can expect, is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!Â ",
