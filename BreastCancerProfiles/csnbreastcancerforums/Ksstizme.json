    "Content": "I got up this morning feeling fine and then not. It started as indigestion and now my back hurts. I took my nexium and I walked alot to ease the indigestion, so I don't know if that caused the back pain. I'm not running any fever, but when my WBC was checked on Friday, I was at .02, so I am worried about infection. I am on an antibiotic and have been careful. Do you think it might be something to call my onc about or just watch it? I have only had one chemo treatment and one neurlastic shot and that was last week.",
