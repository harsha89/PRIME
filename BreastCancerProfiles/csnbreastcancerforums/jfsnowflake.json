    "Content": "Julie: In 1995, at 33 I had a mastectomy with a saline implant. I too asked that question as their was weird feeling things : ) under my skin. My surgeon reminded me to become familiar with the breast and be alert to any differences. Well at the base of the implant something I thought was muscle tissue seemed to grow.....in my case it was a recurrence on the chest wall. It was caught as a local recurrence and I have been in great shape for almost 3 years now. Be alert to changes and NEVER think you are asking too many questions or for too many checkups!! In my case all looked fine in May, but was 2cm by September. This isn't ment to scare you, but to applaud your diligent BSE! Jane",
