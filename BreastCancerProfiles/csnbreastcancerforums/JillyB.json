    "Content": "Vet, You are right, if you told your animal patients what you were told and then ended up with this outcome, you would have no practice left. Have you talked to a lawyer? It really sounds as if you have gotten screwed adnd your Dr's are the type that treat patients as Chart Numbers, not individual people. I personally, not just being a BC patient, but also a Chronic Pain Patient, have a HUGE problem with Doctors who treat people like that. Correct me if I am wrong in assuming this is how you are being treated. I get this feeling from the way you say you feel you have no voice. I know that feeling, and it took a long time to find the right people to work with. I don't know what advice to give you, I just wanted to say I think I may know how you feel like you are being treated and it can really taint your view on the medical profession in general. And the anger it brings out in you can be so draining. And yes, the anger is not productive, and I am sure you know that, but when you get this treatment, it is so frustrating that there is almost no way to control the anger. I have said things to Pain Specialists I thought I would never hear come out of my mouth, but it becomes so insulting that it's like the wire from your brain to your mouth in these situations has been temporarily disconnected! I am completely empathetic to the situation you are going through and hope you find a way out soon. xo, Jilly And like someone said, vent all you want, we are here to listen and try to help, or at least identify with you so you don't feel so alone!",
