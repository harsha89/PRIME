    "Content": "Cherryblssm you got this!!! I too worked from home once I started chemo to avoid coming in contact with folks who were sick and may further compromise my immune system. I got my treatment every 3 weeks on a Friday and was off Sat-Tues., returned to work (from home) on Wed. to finish out workweek then worked Mon-Fri until my next treatment. It kept my mind off of my condition, made the time go by so fast and it kept my mind sharp-chemo brain is real! The anti-nausea meds really helped + Zyrtec for bone pain. I also experienced dry mouth and metallic taste in food/water.  my husband made me wonderful protein / fruit smoothies when i wouldn't eat and I used Biotene dry mouth oral rinse to combat symptoms. Stay strong!! ",
