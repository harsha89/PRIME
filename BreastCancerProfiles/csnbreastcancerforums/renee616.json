      "Content": "I've never had a reaction to taxotere during treatment, but my treatment was postponed a week because of after side effects. Right now I'm 2 weeks out from last treatment and I have a red rash all over my hands still & I'm super tired! I also have a few sores that have popped up. my chemo's all done now so hoping this will go away soon since I'm doing rads now. Good luck with the A/C. I would recommend starting the nausea pills a day or two ahead. I also developed acid reflux with A/C & got a prescription. Renee",

I look like a Frankenstein project with implant, scars & tatoos all over the left side & boob reduction scars on right side! Tomorrows my last Rad appt and I bought some Anthony Thomas candy & some fruit to make a basket for the girls. I wasn't sure how I would feel, but I'm so ready to move on! I guess we will be having a long term relationship with several professional men for years to come! I just wish that they were at least \"paying\" us! :) Glad all went well! Renee",

      "Content": "Hi I'm glad you are seeking a second opinion! If you didn't care for your gyno in the first place, then I'm sure you don't trust his opinion. In our office there's a Male & female gyno. I asked for the female but the appts for her were farther out and everyone highly recommended him. I saw him and liked him. I hope you will get great results and continue to get healthy! Also congrats on the 30 pound weight loss! I'm just biding my time waiting to get started on radiation & see how that pans out, before concentrating on some weight loss myself. I'm glad things have calmed down with your daughter. I did the best I could do raising my two girls, Tried to stay on top of things like the internet, friends, social activities etc. kind of like a Private detective. Then I held my breath and hoped & prayed they didn't fall into bad things like the site you're talking about. I would monitor the computer & sites visited and although she could get on on somebodies else s computer, I would not be opposed to not allowing computer usage if She wasn't following the allowable sites rule. I have a 30 yr old daughter and a 17 yr old. And I have a know it all ten yr old granddaughter who likes to act like her 17 yr old aunt!",

      "Content": "Hi Minka I'm so sorry you joined this club! Yet glad at the same time that you have some people to talk to that know exactly what your going through! I had a mastectomy in Dec of this year. My biggest pain in the butt was the drain tubes. At my hospital, the breast care specialist nurse gave me a bright pink snap up gown with special cut outs for the drain tubes, I had two on one side because I had an immediate implant put in. looking back, The mastectomy was not so bad. I didn't need much help at home. Just had to do things at my own pace. Chemo and radiation followed, All were tiresome but doable. The mastectomy wasn't the worst thing in my treatment plan. The smaller things annoyed me more! You can do this! Emotional support is more needed than physical support. Good luck! I will be watching for updates from you! Hugs & prayers Renee",

      "Content": "Oh my goodness! You just totally wrote exactly how I felt! I told my husband the same thing pretty much! I went through chemo, radiation & 4 surgeries....Did everything they said then boom....Neared the end of radiation and fell apart! I was happy, excited, thrilled....yet so emotional....I think I went through all the motions of doing what needed to be done and finally all the pent up emotions came flooding out! Its been a week since my last radiation appt and I'm starting to get things under control! You wont be able to feel sad too long because theres always something else to do....I got a toothache of all things and was more of a cry baby than everything I've been through in the last ten months then to top it off, I think I have an infection in my breast from my recent breast reduction surgery! I had two Dr appts today & two tomorrow. What I would really like is a get away! A cabin or hotel for a few days would be AWESOME! Maybe to go into the woods and scream....then relax with a book and some peace and quiet, reflect where weve been and where were going from here! I think it keeps getting better! Hang in there! Hugs, Renee",
