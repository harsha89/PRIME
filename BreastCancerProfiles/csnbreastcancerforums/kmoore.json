    "Content": "i had neulasta the day after my last 4 a/c treatments, the bone pain wasn't more than i could handle, i just switched to taxotere and had the neulasta the day after, that was thursday, i am still in so much pain i am in the bathtub every 2 hours. i thought it might be a little bit easier, but i guess not. some times i wish God wouldn't put so much trust in me, you know....won't give me more than i can handle. thanks for letting me vent",
