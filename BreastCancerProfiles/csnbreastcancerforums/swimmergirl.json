    "Content": "This is my first question here and I'm afraid people might think I'm crazy, but here goes anyway. I had a double mastectomy on January 24, 2018. Expanders were put in at the time of surgery and have been filled a few times. Before surgery I was barely an A. I already look bigger than I was before all of this, and it's a little disconcerting. I almost feel like I should tell the plastic surgeon that I'm done and we can do the permanent implants now. But another part of me is thinking \"now is your chance!\" I'm worried about regretting not going a little bigger. And I'm worried about going too big. I'm athletic, and I swim competitively. I like the look of an athletic body with small-ish breasts. But my former breasts weren't awesome (small, and breastfed 2 kids!) Any advice?? My PS keeps asking \"well, how big do you want to be?\" and I don't know what to say. Any advice from someone who's been through it already?",
