      "Content": "I had the same cocktails, 4 infusions of adramyacin/cytoxin every two weeks and 4 Taxol every two weeks. The adramyacin was harder for me than the taxol. I felt a little foggy for several days after the infusion. I kept a journal which helped to show a pattern of how I would feel. I had a hard time sleeping the first couple of days due to the steroids. The fifth day was usually my worst day. I just had to rest more that day, and had less energy. I would take the anti- nausea medication before I felt nauseous. The medication worked and after day three I had no need for it. I actually had a big appetite on chemo, due to the steroids I believe. I was still able to do most things on chemo, just rested and took more naps than usual. I am lucky to be a stay at home mom, so I didn't have to work. I would start feeling more \"normal\" than back to chemo I would have to go. It is frustrating, but we do what we have to. Taxol was much easier for me. There was less fatigue and no nausea. There was a little bone bone. Like everyone said, drink lots of water. I tried to do moderate exercise when I could and that helped. Try to eat a balanced diet. The only thing I couldn't stomach was coffee, and I love coffee. I traded it for hot tea until I was off chemo. Good luck with your treatments Cindy",
