    "Content": "I took Carboplatin and Taxitear chemos and my lungs felt like they were filling with something strange, but it went away. When I mentioned it to my onc. he said that it was normal for the hair folicals in the lungs to ... do something - I forget, but it DID go away... whatever it was. I hope yours goes away too. Please be careful in the ER. Go ahead and ask for a mask and a private room or corner to sit and wait in. No matter what the price, you certainly don't want to catch anything while waiting your turn in the ER! One time I had to go to ER and after a long wait, I phoned my onc on call and he spoke with the ER clerk and I was brought back to a private room where the ER doc finally saw me. I had a fever and severe cramps. They gave me an antibiotic that didn't seem to help, so, I took an acidolpholus capsule and the pain finally went away. Best of prayers are being sent your way for your protection, your healing, and wisdom for your docs. Hugs, because I never got enough when times were a bit scarey. You WILL have better days!",
