    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy in Jan. 2013.  I just finished chemo (yea!!) and will be starting radiation in a couple of weeks. I need some input about my future decisions.  I can't decide if I should have reconstruction or live with the prosthesis.  I am 62 yrs old.   Don't know about the extensive surgery involved.  If I decide not to then I would have to go in and have the excess skin left for possible reconstruction removed (minor procedure) Any thoughts?
