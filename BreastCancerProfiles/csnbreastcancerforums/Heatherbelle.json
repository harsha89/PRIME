It was covered by my insurance - my nurse told me most of the time they are covered. I never even wore mine - i wore mens hanes undershirts most of the time (it was very hot then though!) and pinned my drains to the sides of the shirt. *hugs* Heather",

      "Content": "Bob- Your comment really hit home with me. I had my 5th chemo this past Thursday, 1 more to go. My mother in law had both of our girls this weekend so my husband and I got to spend some alone time this weekend laying around, watching football & movies, napping on the couch. We havent been able to do that in forever -either because of my pain, or from him being at work. His whole life is either work or cancer. He's self employed, and I'm a stay at home mom, so not only does he have the stress of being our only provider, he has to take care of me also. And he does, very well. I can see the stress wearing on him, I can see the pain in his eyes, as much as he tries to hide it from me to spare me from getting sad. I dont know who i'm more relieved for that I'm almost done with chemo - him or me. It must be doubly hard on husbands/partners/caregivers - because for us patients, we have all this support, all the walks, all the websites, this cameraderie & sisterhood to help get us through. I applaud you for all that you do for Donna-im sure she feels as lucky to have you as I do to have my Tim. I stopped and really thanked him this weekend for taking care of me. I'm also sick of cancer. *hugs* Heather",

      "Content": "I had cancer in my right breast, and in July I had both of them removed. At 34 years old, it was probably the biggest decision I've ever made in my life. I'm also undergoing reconstruction & almost done with that part. In the hospital after my mastectomy, I took little peeks under my bandages whenever I could. I did NOT want to have a \"big unveiling\" in front of the mirror or anything. I looked & peeked so that when I did take the bandages off, I wasn't totally shocked. And honestly, I wasn't. It didn't make me cry, or upset me. I made peace with my body the night before my surgery. Of course I would look different, but I am still me on the inside. And I'm alive - something I plan on being for a very long time. I looked up pictures of mastectomy patients also, if you're not too squeamish you might want to do this. Seeing actual photos of other patients helped me out alot. If you haven't already, google \"The Scar Project\" - it's a photography exhibition featuring women who have undergone mastectomy. Beautiful and moving pictures. Also, Samuraimom on here has a website that features her story & pictures from her mastectomy that I found very helpful. If you click on her \"about me\" page she has the link to it on there. *hugs* Heather",

Well, since stopping chemo & starting Tamoxifen, I've lost 9 pounds. Could be Tamoxifen, could be because I'm no longer getting the steroids that made me ravenously hungry, could be because I'm getting my strength and energy back, not really sure but I'm glad for it! That being said, I still have quite a bit to lose - I was diagnosed a year and a half after I had my baby, still hadn't lost all of the 70lbs (yeah! i gained that much with both girls!) that I gained during my pregnancy. So I'm eating healthier (for the most part...) and hitting the treadmill as often as I can to try & get the rest off! *hugs* Heather",

I had 6 or 7 weeks of physical therapy, twice a week for an hour, to work on my knees & hips, and that made SUCH a difference. It really helped. Of course you know im off tamoxifen now, but the therapy helped so much. I had been on percocet since I started chemo because of the intense pain, and now I'm not on anything stronger than ibuprofen & the occasional ice pack :) *hugs* heather",

      "Content": "Hi Helen, I also get migraines, and especially in the springtime. After a few years of tracking my headaches and the seemingly never ending sinus infections I had, my doctor figured it out for me. My migraines were triggered by both hormonal changes surrounding my period, and by my allergies. Allergies would trigger sinus infection, which would turn into migraine headache. I have a prescription specifically for migraines that i take when i feel one coming on, and i also have a prescription that i take at night, as a preventative, when my seasonal allergies flare up. In early spring & late summer, my allergies flare up really bad, and i almost always wake up with a headache, and alot of the time those turn into migraines. Since i've started taking the preventative (Amitryptalin, it's called) my migraines have been cut down i'd say about 80%. I was on tamoxifen for almost 6 months, was recently taken off of it, but when i was on it i didn't notice it giving me any headaches. best of luck to you -i've suffered from frequent headaches and migraines since I was 10 or 11 years old, i know how horrible it is. I hope you can get some relief from them. *hugs* Heather",

I had hair down to the middle of my back when I was diagnosed last June. I had to have chemo also, so when I was diagnosed I cut my hair to just above my shoulders. Then after my mastectomy I got it cut even shorter, and the day before my first chemo i got it cut into a super short pixie cut. It helped me tremendously to get used to looking different (i had long hair since high school). When my hair started falling out from the chemo, I had my husband shave it off. It gave me control & was easier than literally watching it all fall out. I'm glad you found this site - I found it when I was waiting for my biopsy results. It really helps to correspond with others who have \"been there, done that\". Chemo IS scary. I was terrified. It really helped me to read chemo-related posts on here.

I chose to have both breasts removed to give myself a better chance of it not coming back. I was told that there is always a chance of reoccurance at the incision site, on the chest wall, etc. That is what the 5 years of Tamoxifen (I'm on that too) is supposed to help prevent. It took me a few weeks of research, thinking, and talking to 3 different doctors, along with everyone on here, to come up with my surgical decision. My feelings, ultimately, were that I would MUCH rather feel like I did TOO MUCH in my fight against breast cancer, than NOT ENOUGH. I read about (and personally know a few women) so many women who had a lumpectomy, and a few years later have a reoccurence & end up needing a mastectomy after all. You're right to feel angry about this. Now that my treatment (chemo) is over, and Im done with surgeries, I'm finding myself angry alot. I'm so pissed that this had to happen to me at all, that I had to lose my hair and my breasts, and that my husband, kids, and parents have had to deal with what happened to me. But, at the end of the day - I'm alive, my hair is growing back, and I'm cancer free. If you need to chat or anything, you can always send me a message on here or on facebook (FB messages come through on my cell phone right away so i get those faster).

Go for it! If done right I've seen it look really good, just make sure you have a really reputable artist. Actually-if I were you, I would find the most reputable tattoo artist in your area, rather than a beautician type deal-you want the person with the most experience putting permanent ink on your body.

So now she will have to have chemo included in her treatment. She's handling it better than I expected, and again I have to say I'm grateful that I'm going through everything right before her, so that it's not so scary for her, and that I can help her through it. My husband says I'm going to be mom's \"Cancer Coach\". Tomorrow morning I'm going back up to the hospital, and I'm taking her home while my dad's at work & me & my girls are going to take care of her until dad gets home. I'll know more about where we're going from here as far as her treatment, tomorrow when we see the Dr. I know firsthand that chemo is good and will help her get better, I was just so happy at the idea of my mom, who's in a pretty fragile physical state anyways, not having to go through chemo..it is hard, and I don't want to see her in more pain, or uncomfortable. But, if it helps keep her healthy & around for many many more years, then she's going to get through it just like I am. We actually have the same oncologist, I'm going to see if they can get our treatments on the same schedule so that she can come with me - the cancer center our Onc is at is across town, mom doesn't drive anymore, so it would be so much easier. And if not, I'll just go along with her on her days. Thanks for letting me share this, I know I've been posting about my mom's situation ever since I took her to her follow up mammogram. *hugs* Heather",

I also consulted a plastic surgeon before deciding on what surgery to have, and i ultimately decided to have a double. I decided to go with a double for two reasons, 1- peace of mind that it wont eventually come back in the other breast, and 2- cosmetically it would just look better having both removed and reconstructed. I'm close to 2 years post surgery, and I couldnt be happier with my results. I have silicone implants, but i believe you can achieve a bigger size if you go with saline implants. The largest size you can get with silicone is 800cc, which are pretty big around, but they dont have the \"projection\" like you would think, because i have no breast tissue , just implants. I know it's a hard decision, best of luck to you L( *hugs* heather",

And its completely normal to fear every little ache and pain, most of us do, and that's something that will abide a little more and more, the more time goes by. I also had about a month wait from diagnosis until surgery, due to scheduling difficulties (had to get my breast surgeon and my plastic surgeon to sync their schedules so they could both be there at the same time). Take it one day at a time, and fill your days with fun things that you enjoy, and come here to the boards, ask all your questions, read through the posts, and find comfort :) *hugs* heather",

We are juggling raising children during treatment and surgeries, i personally am BRCA1 + which is a huge thing to deal with because I have two daughtes who are at a huge risk, and that thought scares me more than my own diagnosis. So one brush with the disease is bad enough.

I haven't met with my gynecologist since I've started Tamoxifen, but I need to have an appt just to get all my questions cleared up. Once you've had the ablation, does that mean the lining CAN'T grow back & therefore we don't have to worry about that side effect of the tamoxifen? I hear ya on the hot flashes - mine were REALLY bad the first week I was taking it, but that could have been leftover chemo causing them too.

My next appt with my oncologist is Thursday, I'll find out more about Tamoxifen, when I'm starting it, etc. I'm just glad he is putting me on it, weak positive or not, it's going to give me added protection that I'm happy for :) *hugs* Heather",

They put her on antibiotics & watched the swelling, it went down but when she finished the antibiotics it swelled up again. she ended up in the hospital & they removed 80cc's of fluid, and put another drain back in for 3 days. Since then (2 weeks ago) though it's been removed & has been fine. Hang in there sister, it will get better. Chemo is really hard but do-able -i hope your treatments go by fast & take it easy on you :) *hugs* Heather",
