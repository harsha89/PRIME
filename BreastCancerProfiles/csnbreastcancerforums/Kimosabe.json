      "Content": "I have one more chemo to go on Aug. 24. I am 61 and a resource teacher three days a week. Staff development begins Aug. 26 (won't make that) and classes on Aug.30! I seem to be more tired with each chemo treatment and my dilemma is I have radiation to face in mid Sept. I understand from some people that chemo exacerbates the fatigue from radiation and I'm wondering whether to try to return to work or just go on a TDI for a couple of months which would allow for a steady sub to take my place and not be disruptive to my students.Of course my doctors say that everyone is different and it is hard to predict. Any advice?",
