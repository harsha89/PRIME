      "Content": "My 19 yo son is home this weekend from college (his first year...I also have a 17 yo who will graduate hs in June) and I can't even go to the movies with him. My son is clinically depressed and on medication (I am biPolar and clinically depressed) and he has been abused. He has almost no social skills, no friends and has spoken since my b/c journey started almost a year ago of committing suicide. I am extremely close to this my first child (he seems to need me more than my younger son though I adore them both) and he has been the one most impacted since my cancer diagnosis. He is so afraid he is going to lose me and we have made a pact...as long as I keep fighting, he will too. I so wanted to do something with him this weekend (believe me, I have not done much with my children since my diagnosis), and because I cannot (due to severe pain), I am kicking myself from here to next Monday. I feel as though I have let my children down in so many ways...I wasn't healthy when I had them and now, it's even worse. My husband (their stepfather) is an incredible man who loves me and loves my children and does everything in his power to be supportive and helpful (and yes, even to listen to my many seemingly obtuse questions and observations)...I couldn't ask for any better. Never asks me for anything and I am so grateful for him. I really am content in my life but I feel as though I am shortchanging my children. Anyone else feel this way?",

No one seems to be in any real hurry to remove it and it feels like it's starting to pop out of my skin. Have an evening filled with wonder....",
