      "Content": "This test is performed on the tumor it's self, it's done by only 1 lab in the U.S. and is fairly new (2003 or 2004) Oncologist's really like this test at least that's what my onco said, because it's proving to be be very effective. What it does is anylize 21 different genes inside your tumor ( they test each sample 3 times) and rates or scores your individual reoccurance rate. In the past many women have been over treated with chemo when there was really no benefit from it for them at all. If you have a low score like me (10) then most likely you'll go straight to rads unless there is some other reason your onco can give you why not, remember all cases of cancer do vary. But if you have a high score then all onco's will recommend chemo, as that is the best way to lower your reoccurance rate. There are still many trials out there for this test as they are trying to define the line or the grey area, which is a score betwen 18 and (I thought)25, but it may be 30 as was stated above. If you score in this range your doctor will do more tests, like those mentioned above and let you make the dicision (while giving you the pro's and con's) on which route to take (as well as their opinion) or what is most beneficial for you. For me personally if I had scored in the grey area I would have opted for chemo, no matter what my doctor said, but that's just me. That's why I opted out of the trial, I'm all for helping our future sister's in pink, but not if I feel an unnecessay risk to myself. In the trial the people in the grey range would be split up randomly where half received chemo and the other half didn't, and they would monitor both groups to see which ones had a reoccurance and who didn't. My doctor said she had no problem doing the test as long as I would go with whatever treatment she thought was best if I was in the grey, when she confirmed that chemo would be her choice, I said no problem. Many insurances cover the test and some only cover part, I think it's all in how the doctor words the need of it to them. I think what she was afraid of was that many people do not want to do chemo and are looking for a way out, so even after they hear they're in the grey they won't go through with it, so she wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting the test. I highly recommend getting the test, it will help you make a more informed decision, for me it was just another tool, in feeling I was getting the right treatment I needed to fight this beast. I hope I explained this clearly enough, and that it will help you in some small way. Good luck and God bless, Aurora",
