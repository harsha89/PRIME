      "Content": "I requested my hubby be at important appointments... with doctors... anything else that he would just have to \"sit and wait\" for me I indicated he didn't need to be there... I understood he needed to be at work and I had friends that were there to help... He did come to one chemo treatment--it was good for him to see what I went through and he did give up a morning which he was off... Meals were brought to us on the weekends I had A/C... when I went to Taxol, I was able to do simple meals or we went to Blimpy's or something like that... Communication is key... when hubby seem to \"not get\" why I wasn't in the mood to do a meal or go somewhere... I explained why as gently as I could... Remember hubby's are going through this differently, they see you suffering and don't know what to do... encourage him to talk with his friends/co-workers... they can encourage him and he doesn't hold it inside... he too needs to talk about it...",
