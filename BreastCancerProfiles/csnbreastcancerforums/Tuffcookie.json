    "Content": "Hello Everyone out there that may be experiencing a \"multitude\" of side effects. I was diagnosed with stage IIA breast cancer in 2016. I am undergoing chemotherapy every three weeks at Virginia Oncology Center. The side effects are worse the first couple of weeks after treatment. Everyone hang in there and take it one step at a time, one treatment at a time. I have had several treatments already and will undergo one more in a couple of weeks. Yes chemo is harsh on the body but keep fighting and keep hanging in there, live and love life! The side effects I've experienced are so many, I don't want to list them here. Eat healthy when you can. Sometimes you may not be able to eat anything besides Ensure, soup, bannanas, and yogurt. Also the side effects do subside over time, between treatment.",
