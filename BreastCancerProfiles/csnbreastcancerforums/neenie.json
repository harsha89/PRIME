      "Content": "Hi Karen Rose! Every cancer patient's experience is different. Alot depends on the type of chemo you'll get and how it affects you. In 1996, I had 4 rounds of chemo for 3 months before my mastectomy for inflammatory breast cancer. I was given the chemo via IV at the hospital on an outpatient basis, and was very ill for a few days afterwards. I was out of work 3 days after each session. For 9 months after surgery, I took chemo pills daily and went to the doctor's office once a week for an injection, which didn't make me sick. I only missed 1 day of work during that time period because I had a cold. However, some days I had to push myself harder to get to work because I was very tired. Talk with your doctor and do what's best for you. Neenie",
