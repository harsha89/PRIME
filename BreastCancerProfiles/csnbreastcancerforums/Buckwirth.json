Me, I ignored the signs, so on January 11th I awoke from surgery with my butt glued shut, and a pretty bag attached to my abdomen. Please, don't join me in this club! Get tested!",

      "Content": "Were you aware that March was Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month? Congratulations to all here who were tested on schedule. Â To those who doubt the importance of getting checked on schedule, I copied the information below from the ACS site: Five Myths About Colorectal Cancer Many times, colorectal cancer can be prevented. Still, it's one of the 5 most common cancers in men and women in the United States. Colorectal cancer is also one of the leading causes of cancer death in the United States. Don't let these 5 common myths stop you from getting the lifesaving tests you need, when you need them. Myth: Colorectal cancer is a man\u2019s disease. Truth: Colorectal cancer is just as common among women as men. Each year, about 150,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and about 50,000 die from the disease. Myth: Colorectal cancer cannot be prevented. Truth: In many cases colorectal cancer can be prevented. Colorectal cancer almost always starts with a small growth called a polyp. If the polyp is found early, doctors can remove it and stop colorectal cancer before it starts. These tests can find polyps: double contrast barium enema, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy). Truth: African-American men and women are diagnosed with and die from colorectal cancer at higher rates than men and women of any other US racial or ethnic group. The reason for this is not yet understood. Myth: Age doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to getting colorectal cancer. Truth: More than 90% of colorectal cancer cases are in people age 50 and older. For this reason, the American Cancer Society recommends you start getting tested for the disease at age 50. People who are at a higher risk for colorectal cancer -- such as those who have colon or rectal cancer in their families -- may need to begin testing at a younger age. Talk to your doctor about when you should start getting tested. Myth: It\u2019s better not to get tested for colorectal cancer because it\u2019s deadly anyway. Truth: Colorectal cancer is often highly treatable. If it is found and treated early (while it is small and before it has spread), the 5-year survival rate is about 90%. But because many people are not getting tested, only about 4 out of 10 are diagnosed at this early stage when treatment is most likely to be successful.",

      "Content": "Were you aware that colon cancer kills more people than BC? Colonoscopies save lives, however, if they pose difficulties for you there are alternatives. The best one is a \"virtual\" colonoscopy using a CT scan. Please, get checked regularly, and if you show any signs between regular checkups insist on one of the above tests. It very well could save your life.",

      "Content": "At least get one of the alternatives. For most the only difficult part about the procedure is the prep. I'm a man, but I just had a mammogram and a breast biopsy. If I can do that you can get a colonoscopy. ;) Were you aware that colorectal cancer kills more people than breast cancer, and that if caught early it is preventable? Caught late it is a terrible disease, and while I am early in my treatments, I would not wish this on anyone. So please, everyone, get tested if you are over 50, or if you see blood in your stool, or if there is colon cancer in your family. Don't put it off, or think it can't happen to you.",
