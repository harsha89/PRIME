Dave thinks to himself, \"Nurses are known to be hot to trot.\" The second man married a telephone operator. Dave thinks to himself, \"Telephone operators have sexy voices.\" The third man married a school teacher. Dave thinks to himself, \"Poor guy, teachers are frigid.\" The next morning, Dave reports to work and gets a room service call from the nurse's husband. He sourly says, \"Don't ever marry a nurse. All I heard last night was 'You're not sanitary, you're not sanitary.'\" Then, the telephone operator's husband calls and sourly says, \"Don't ever marry a telephone operator. All I heard last night was 'Your three minutes are up, your three minutes are up.'\" Later that afternoon, the teacher's husband calls and happily says, \"When you marry, be sure to marry a school teacher. All I heard last night was 'We are going to do this over and over until we get right.'\"",

My son,Jake, came with me when I got my head shaved and he got a buzz cut to show his support for me. I only wore baseball type hats when I dropped him off at school and never wore hats or scarves any other time. At Easter that year he took his washable markers and drew colored Easter eggs on my bald head before we went to church--yes we got some strange looks but he was happy he had his mom beside him that day and we still talk about that day. Jake has asked me each Easter if I would shave my head again so he could color Easter eggs on it. In just a few wks it will be 3 yrs since I was diagnosed. Jake and I make every day special and memorable. I am happy to say that this Christmas we will be flying to warm Florida from cold Maine and having the time of our lives and meeting more Pink Sisters while we are down there. We are both happy and healthy and each day we are thankful for each other and our family and friends. TIP: when those little nubs of hair really start to bother you use a lint brush that has the tape on it and roll it over your head a few times a day--it works great. Hugs, Margo",

My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!' Ms. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed. Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. Principal: 'What is 3 x 3?' Harry: '9.' Principal: 'What is 6 x 6?' Harry: '36.' And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, 'I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade' Ms. Brooks says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions.' The principal and Harry both agreed. Ms. Brooks asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?' Harry, after a moment: 'Legs.' Ms. Brooks: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?' The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! Harry replied: 'Pockets.' Ms. Brooks: 'What does a dog do that a man steps into?' Harry: 'Pants.' The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open. Ms. Brooks: 'What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?' Harry: 'Shake hands.' The principal was trembling. Ms. Brooks: 'What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?' Harry: 'Fire truck.' The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, 'Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last five questions wrong.",

He flicked it on. 'It represents a candle', he said. 'You may pass through the pearly gates' Saint Peter said. The second man reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. He shook them and said, 'They're bells.' Saint Peter said 'You may pass through the pearly gates'. The third man started searching desperately through his pockets and finally pulled out a pair of women's panties. St. Peter looked at the man with a raised eyebrow and asked, 'And just what do those symbolize?' The man replied, 'These are Carols.' And So The Christmas Season Begins......",

Stepdaughter is wonderful. she lives in California after moving from Hawaii. When she comes to visit her dad she always comes to visit me. We have a great relationship. Stepson on the other hand lives one hour away and the last time I saw him was a few days after Christmas. He moved from Hawaii in September of 2007 and his father, my husband at the time, told him he could stay with us, without even asking me. One day I got home from work and I was given the news that he was staying and not going back to Hawaii. He stayed until February when I kicked his butt to the curb because he couldn't hold a job and I was the only one working and paying for everything except the house payment which my husband paid from his retirement check. His son still has stuff down in my cellar and I told him that he has two weeks to get it out or I am selling it to the highest bidder. One out of two isn't bad. I would tell your nieces and nephews that they need to visit you and their grandmother when they are up and that their mother and you did not raise them this way. Also tell them one phone call a month is all that you ask of them. For the neighbors--I would remind them of their promise and if they can't do it then like someone else mentioned a church or boy scout group could help. Hugs to you, Margo",

It is the fattest tree. Once it was on my car-Toyota Echo-it hung over the sides of the roof. When I brought it into the house it got stuck in the front door and I had to go out the back door to a neighbors house to have him come and pull it inside the house. Thank god I have a sturdy stand and a big piece of wood on the rug for stability. The tree takes over 1/2 the living room. As we were driving I think people were either laughing at our small car carrying such a big tree or they were wondering how big our house was. Will try and post pictures soon. Happy Holidays to all.

He is in Florida during the winter with his lady friend and I don't know if it is a dad/guy thing but he called me three weeks after my surgery and when I told him I was doing fine he didn't believe me and had to call my sister to see if what I said was true. I got a get well card from him and his lady friend ONE month after my surgery and addressed to Marco and not Margo--his lady friend addressed the envelope. When I asked him to bring me to my treatments when he came to Maine since my sister and mother were doing it all he said, \"We'll see maybe we can combine visits\" I asked him what he meant by that and he said bring me to my treatment which is 2 hours and then visit his lady friends family for the rest of the week. Blood boiling---on my part. He has only one grandson, my son and last year he saw us three times in 5 months for an hour each time and then visited with her family several times at a week at a time. My son knows his grandfather as the \"Savings bond grampy\"--pretty sad. I will not need a driver anymore when I go for my treatments of Taxol w/Herceptin and then Herceptin alone and I am not going to mention this to him. Maybe he is scared and doesn't know how to deal with it. Another thing he has done is had knee surgery and never told my sister or I about it until it was all over then he had a reaction to some medication he was on and had to be hospitalized and we didn't find out about it until two weeks after. I think everyone reacts to things differently and maybe they are scared and don't know what to say or how to deal with it and some just go out of your lives because of this. I didn't mean to dwell on my stuff but it just PISSES me off that my father can't step up to the plate and be a dad. I just edited this to add maybe I need to tell my father that he needs to get some balls, backbone and think for himself instead of having her do it for him. He was never like this until he got with her. Margo",

After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, 'If anyone calls me Onestone again, I will kill them!' The word got around and nobody called him that any more. Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.' He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion. The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do. Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away. Yellow Bird, who wasBlue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone. She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.' Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, made love to her all the next night, butYellow Bird wouldn't die! Why ??? OH, come on ... take a guess !!! Think about it !!! You're going to love this !!! Everyone knows... You can't kill Two Birds with OneStone !!!",

Usually the surgeon will refer you to see a medical oncologist and/or a radiation oncologist after the pathology reports are back. Some surgeons have you see the specialists before for options depending on what the results MIGHT be. I don't know anything about Regional Cancer Centers unless they are a center which has a whole team there. If it is one of those places then it would not hurt to see the whole multi-disciplinary team. Good luck with your mammogram on Friday. Best wishes, Margo",

      "Content": "NUDITY I was driving with my three young children one warm summer evening when a woman in the convertible ahead of us stood up and waved. She was stark naked! As I was reeling from the shock, I heard my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, \"Mom! That lady isn't wearing a seat belt!\" HONESTY My son Zachary, 4, came screaming out of the bathroom to tell me he'd dropped his toothbrush in the toilet. So I fished it out and threw it in the garbage. Zachary stood there thinking for a moment, then ran to my bathroom and came out with my toothbrush. He held it up and said with a charming little smile, \"We better throw this one out too then, 'cause it fell in the toilet a few days ago.\" OPINIONS On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother. The note read, \"The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.\" KETCHUP A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup to come out of the jar. During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. \"It's the minister, Mommy,\" the child said to her mother Then she added, \"Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.\" MORE NUDITY A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover. The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, \"What's the matter haven't you ever seen a little boy before?\" ELDERLY While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4- year-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. The various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs, unfailingly intrigued her. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, \"The tooth fairy will never believe this!\" DRESS-UP A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party. When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, \"Daddy, you shouldn't wear that suit.\" \"And why not, darling?\" \"You know that it always gives you a headache the next morning..\" DEATH While walking along the sidewalk in front of his church, our minister heard the intoning of a prayer that nearly made his collar wilt. Apparently, his 5-year-old son and his playmates had found a dead robin. Feeling that proper burial should be performed, they had secured a small box and cotton batting, then dug a hole and made ready for the disposal of the deceased. The minister's son was chosen to say the appropriate prayers and with sonorous dignity intoned his version of what he thought his Father always said: \"Glory be unto the Faaaather, and unto the Sonnn .. and into the hole he gooooes.\" SCHOOL A little girl had just finished her first week of school. \"I'm just wasting my time,\" she said to her mother. \"I can't read, I can't write and they won't let me talk!\" BIBLE A little boy opened the big family bible. He was fascinated as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible. He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages. \"Mama, look what I found\", the boy called out. \"What have you got there, dear?\" With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, \"I think it's Adam's underwear.\"",

That's right, people in Maine believe marriage should be a sacred institution between a really stoned man and a really stoned woman.\" \u2013Conan O'Brien \"Big losses for the Democrats in the elections. Here's how bad it was for the Democrats \u2014 earlier today, the Democratic Party was begging Rush Limbaugh for pain killers.\" \u2013David Letterman \"There's a new book that's coming out about Sarah Palin. And the book contains a copy of the speech she would have given if John McCain had won and she had became vice president. Yeah. The speech is entitled, 'Uh-oh.'\" \u2013Conan O'Brien \"Next February, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will be debate, at Radio City Music Hall. I'm looking forward to that line of high-kicking Secret Service agents.\" \u2013David Letterman \"Some pictures of President Obama posted on the internet seem to show the President looking very thin. ... They say he looks too thin, but White House docs say not to worry, Barack Obama's one of those guys who can eat whatever he wants and still not gain weight. Yet another reason for Rush Limbaugh to hate him.\" \u2013Jay Leno \"Over in Washington, President Obama called and congratulated Republican Bob McDonnell today after he won the governorship in Virginia. Obama then moved Virginia to the bottom of the swine flu vaccine waiting list.\" \u2013Jimmy Fallon \"Reporters are saying President Obama has been skipping meals lately, and now photographs show he has lost a lot of weight. Folks, if this is true, then maybe Obama really has lost touch with the American people.\" \u2013Conan O'Brien \"A year ago today, Barack Obama was elected president. It's been a year, can you believe that? Yeah. A lot's happened. Yeah. In one short year, Obama's slogan has gone from, 'Yes, we can,' to 'Wow, this is freakin' hard.'\" \u2013Conan O'Brien \"Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, scolded Pakistan leaders for not going after Al Qaeda and just pretending that they didn't see a problem that everyone else in the world could see. Ouch. How about that, huh? Imagine, Hillary Clinton lecturing you on turning a blind eye to a problem that the rest of the world could see.\" \u2013Jay Leno \"In his first year in office, President Obama has traveled to 16 foreign countries, more than any other president in history. Bush only traveled to 11, but most of those were just different parts from the 'It's a Small World' ride.\" \u2013Jimmy Fallon",

Herceptin targets the protein that is over expressed on the gene to kill it. Her2 pos is an aggressive type breast cancer so you have to treat it agressively in this way. Hugs, Margo",

He grabs his 8-iron and proceeds down the embankment into the ravine in search of his ball. Ben searches diligently throught the thick underbrush and suddenly he spots something shiny. As he gets closer, he realizes that the shiny object is in fact an 8-iron in the hands of a skeleton lying near an old golf ball. Ben excitedly calls out to his golfing partner: \"Hey Thomas, come here, I got big trouble down here.\" Thomas comes running over to the edge of the ravine and calls out: \"What`s the matter Ben?\" Ben shouts back in a nervous voice: \"Throw me my 7-iron! Looks like you can`t get out of here with an 8-iron.\"",

This virus is called Weary Overload Recreational Killer (WORK). If you receive WORK from your boss, any of your colleagues, or anyone else via any means whatsoever - DO NOT TOUCH IT. This virus will wipe out your private life completely. If you should come into contact with WORK you should immediately leave the premises. Take two good friends to the nearest grocery store and purchase one or both of the antidotes - Work Isolating Neutralizer Extract (WINE) and Bothersome Employer Elimination Rebooter (BEER). Take the antidote repeatedly until WORK has been completely eliminated from your system. You should immediately forward this medical alert to five friends. If you do not have five friends, you have already been infected and WORK is controlling your life. Trusting you will do the right thing. P.S. If you have developed immunity from WINE and BEER, then as a last resort, take a VACATION (Viral Antidote for Contagious Anxiety- Taxing Incessant Overwork Neurosis) for 2 weeks.",
