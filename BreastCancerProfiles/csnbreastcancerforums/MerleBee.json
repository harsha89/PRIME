    "Content": "I did not have warts but I do have psorisis and it cleared up during my chemo. I believe that both warts and psorisis have some connectionto the immune system. I wonder if it has something to do with the jump start to the immune system from the Nulasta shot rather than the chemo...just a thought. Unfortunately, the psorisis is coming back, only seconds after the chin wiskers...how is that right? :(",
