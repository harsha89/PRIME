    "Content": "Hello, I just wanted to ask anyone on this discussion board if anyone has had a white dot in the very center of the nipple? My mom at 85 had a total abdominal hysterectomy with a rare and aggressive type of uterine cancer uterine papillary serous carcinoma. The staging showed the lowest possible stage 1a. no chemo as the dr didn't think it necessary and probably also due to her age. She is a strong woman and is doing quite well with just having the surgery 1 month ago. Today she got scared and she showed me this white dot in the center of her one nipple, so of course now we got worried and i am taking her to a walk in Mammogram clinic at Kaiser Hospital by our home. She had not had a mammo for several years. Has anyone had this before and could it be a sign of breast cancer? I know the type of uterine cancer she had exfoliates cells and could end up in breast or lymph nodes or anywhere. Please help.. Thanks so much, Cookie aka Linda",
