    "Content": "I have two questions about DIEP: 1)  Has anyone that is a bit overweight had a DIEP?  I am about 35 lbs over weight and considering a DIEP.  I'm worried that a flatter tummy and smaller breasts will look odd with my fat neck, arms and thighs.  People say I will loose weight because of the surgery.  But I'm concerned I'll look wierd.   Has anyone been in this situation?  2)  How long did it take you to go back to work after the surgery? Thank you!",
