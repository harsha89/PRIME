The bond that we have, the encouragement and support from each and every one you is amazing. We stand together during the good times and the bad. That has never been more evident than at the recent loss of Heidi and now Moopy. The outpouring of your words, the flowers, the songs, the wearing of pink, the poems have shown how big our hearts are and how fragile we all are. We are like a circle of wagons surrounding whoever needs our protection. We applaud and dance when NED is posted. We sometimes only write a few words, but, those words resound a trillion times over to the sister needing to hear them. You are all amazing and I am so grateful, so thankful to call you my sisters! So get ready, because I am sending each of you the biggest hug today that I can give! Love, Sue :)",

      "Content": "Yep I did!  For those of you that don't remember, I did my first Relay For Life in 2010.  I was scared to do it, as, I was afraid it would drag up a bunch of bad memories and I thought, for some reason, that it might be depressing.  Go figure!  It was the most enlightening experience I've ever had!  Well, not ever had, but, it is right up there!  So this year, I had so many friends and family that were urging me to do it again AND I was asked to speak there. Speak?  ME?  In front of everyone?  Yikes!  I decided that I would, I would go to the Relay and I would also speak.  So, I'd been preparing my speech, nothing all gloomy, just some facts and what I'd been through, a couple of funny stories and talked of the cure.  Like how there is life after cancer, but, so much more needs to be done to find a cure.  I had been asked to briefly tell of my journey with bc, which I did.  While I was telling about the surgery, the rads, all of the tests we still have to endure, how unfortunately we always fear it might come back, you could hear sniffles in the crowd.  I was right next to the crowd, so, you could hear everything.  Almost all of them were wearing Survivor tshirts.  It really struck me, at that moment, how truly embedded we all are, those of us that have had bc.  Our closeness, our bond, has always reminded me of the bond that men and women share that are in the military and go to war.  Perhaps no one outside can really understand, but man can the ones that have been through it get it.  The weather was awesome!  It couldn't have been a nicer day.  I did take all of you with me!  Yessiree!  I did!  Cat's Toy, awhile back, had written all of your names down and I printed off what she had written and added the ones that weren't on there.  So see, you were all with me.  I carried all of you in my pockets!  I hope you didn't get too scrunched up!  lol The Survivor's Lap was emotional again.  Everyone applauding, the proud survivors taking that special lap just for them.  My husband was holding me tight again for fear, I think, that I might crumble, but, I did great.  I had family members there and over 40 friends that walked with me.  It gave me strength and made me so happy to have my loved ones with me on that very important lap.  Then the luminaries at night....  Beautiful in their own way, yet, sad knowing that with each one comes a cancer survivor.  I think when they find a cure for cancer we need to take all of the luminaries in the world and make a big bonfire of them, kind of like they do on Survivor with past contestants.  It was emotional, it was soul touching. Well, that's it.  Actually I could write more, but, I think I've written my limit.  lol  I enjoyed having all of you pinkies with me this past weekend for the Relay For Life!  I love all of you! Love, Sue  ",

I went shopping with a couple of girlfriends and we had a blast! I bought him some presents and had them wrapped by a professional. They looked great! And, bought myself a really pretty outfit to wear that night and put it on at one of my girlfriend's house before I went home. So, the call comes and I hurry home, anxious and excited! When I get home, my hubby had candles lit all over the sunroom and rose petals on the floor leading to the table that he had set with my good china. He even put out one of my good tablecloths and linen napkins. The table and the room were awesome and so romantic. It just looked beautiful! He cooked steaks out ( yum ) and even made my famous twice baked potatoes with a fresh garden salad and dinner rolls. A bottle of good wine was chilling next to the table and I was thirsty and hungry! lol We finished our dinner and then went into the family room to open our gifts. He had candles lit in there too and a fire in the fireplace. We sat by the fire as we opened every present and were both amazed! He had gotten me this absolutely beautiful pink stones and diamond bracelet! Not too big..just very delicate and so, so pretty! He said he had one more surprise for me, and, he said we needed to go to our bedroom. I was like...uh huh..I know what this surprise is. lol When I walked into our bedroom, he had hung bunches of red hearts from the ceiling and on each and every one of them, it told a reason why he loved me! Can you believe it? Every red heart that I read, not only made me cry, but, touched my heart in a way that I didn't think possible. What an amazing gift! What a thoughtful and truly loving gift to me. I think it was the best one! Just don't tell him that. lol So, this was another magical night, Valentine's Day, with the most loving, wonderful man that exists...my husband! Sue :)",
