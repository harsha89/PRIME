    "Content": "Dear Nancy, My port was put in 2 days before my first infusion and was so sore I thought I'd scream if someone were to look at it crooked. I have only had 2 treatments so far and my next one will be on the 13th. I wondered when they put the line in my port to draw blood if it would be too bad but I told them how tender it was and they sprayed it with a numbing agent which I found that they only do this to new patients. After the first time it does get tougher and doesn't hurt as much. Then as I sat there I also wondered what my body would do as the killer \"red stuff\" entered my body, so I prayed and you know it was like nothing was really happening to me. I didn't feel any different or anything. That night and the next day I was running in circles trying to find something to do. That was a side effect of the steroids. Then on Sunday \"day 2\" my bones ached like I had the flu. \"day 3\" I stayed in the bed. My second treatment ran just about the same way. I hope and pray that your treatment goes pretty well too. My prayers will be with you tomorrow. get some rest Lots of Love Michelle",
