Then after they were removed I had fluid build up again, primarily on the unaffected side. I also had no node invovement. I had to be drained all through chemo on a regular basis. I absolutely hated that feeling of the fluid when it is rollin around in your chest. My plastic surgeon suggested reconstruction might resolve the problem and I had a tram-flap recon. in Dec.. I have not had any problem since. Be patient, know you are not alone, your body is just trying to figure out how to respond to everything you have been through. God Bless you, Alison",

It's about getting the cancer/tumor out(surgery)before it starts shedding cells and then doing the adjuvent treatments depending on your cancer. It's all very complicated and hard to process when your right in the middle of it all. I think your idea of talking to a professional is a good one. I had bilat. mast. June 09 then did months of chemo,and found some counseing to be VERY helpfull. My counselor specialized in people with cancer, transplant patients, ect. and she really helped me see that my life is truly worth the fight. God bless you and I'll keep you in my prayers!
