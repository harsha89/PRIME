    "Content": "Hello friends, My mother had a biopsy on her breast this past Monday. She was told to call her doctor if she hadn't heard anything in 2-3 days. When she called, on Thursday, the nurse told her that the doctor wanted to see her in person, the next day. My father took her in to see the doctor on Friday and when I called her to find out what the results were, she simply said, \"Well, honey, the doctor told me that I have cancer. He wants me to see a specialist next week. He told me not to worry. Don't worry honey, everything is going to be alright.\" I wanted to go to her immediately, but my sister was already there, asking questions and talking to the specialist on the phone. I have an estranged relationship with my sister, so I didn't go over. I also felt, that my parents had already had too much going on for that day. My husband and I will be with my parents tomorrow but I don't even know where to begin...I have been crying a lot and praying, but I really can't find the proper words to comfortably express what I need to say. I don't know how to talk about this with my mother without getting too emotional. My mother is a very, very strong lady and I have only see her cry a few times in all of my 56 years. She is going to be 88 in May, God bless her, and is a very happy and faithful person. How should I approach this? Â ",
