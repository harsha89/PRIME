      "Content": "The point of Tamoxifen is to prevent a recurrence of estrogen-receptive breast cancer. Tamoxifen occupies the place in a cancerous cell where estrogen would otherwise attach itself, preventing the cell from feeding on estrogen. No food, and it can't grow. Yes, the side effects can be frustrating, but as far as I am concerned they beat the alternative. Talk to your doctor and anyone else you can find about how to control weight gain. Don't stop taking Tamoxifen because of fifteen pounds.",

      "Content": "Does it get better when you stay off your feet and then hurt when you stand up or walk again? Does it get worse when you do a lot of walking? The plantar fascia is part of a chain of tendons that starts in your hip, runs behind your knee, past your ankle (Achilles tendon), and crosses over your foot from the heel to the middle of the outside of your foot. When you don't stretch, it tightens up, and then when you walk on it it pulls and causes hurt somewhere in the system, usually at the heel. It is also worse if you are heavy, but my young fit daughter has it, so being heavy is not a requirement. First line of defense is stretching: face the wall and lean against it. Put one foot back at a time and feel the stretch in the back of your knee. Do this 10-15 times on both sides two or three times a day. That might be all you need -- just don't stop stretching when it gets better. If that doesn't do the trick, you can have custom orthotics made (a doctor prescribes them and insurance usually pays for them) and/or have a shot of cortisone in your heel. That makes it better for a few months, allowing you to work on the root cause with stretching so that when the cortisone wears off you won't injure the tendon again. I am not a doctor, but I do have personal experience with plantar fasciitis!",

      "Content": "It's tough to take everything in, especially when you are stressed and your doctor is disorganized. I like to get as much information as I can on my own, from the web or books (Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book is great, and there is a new edition less than a year old). ACTH is one of the combinations of chemo drugs they use -- A and C are Adriamycin and Cytoxan; T is Taxol and H is Herceptin (because you are HER positive). Look them up. Adriamycin is a nasty drug, but it does the job, and four treatments of A/C three weeks apart is pretty standard. Then, depending on your particular cancer, they follow up -- in my case with 12 weekly Taxol treatments (I am not HER positive), although sometimes they do Taxol every two or three weeks. Look these drugs up, along with their side effects, so you can be prepared. Write down your questions and make sure someone at your doctor's office answers them. You are entitled to have as much knowledge as you want about your treatment!",

I am going to count as the real ending as the day my skin gets less red instead of redder! But I, too, am so glad to have that time in my day back. Now onward to getting my port out and cleaning up my mastectomy scar, and to figuring out how to think about something other than myself and my health.",

      "Content": "This is my second go-round with breast cancer. Not a recurrence, the new tumor(s) had a completely different profile. I had Mammosite radiation, a form of brachitherapy, the first time, and am signed up for conventional radiation when I finish chemo this time. My radiation oncologist said that whatever my risk of recurrence is after chemo (and I also had a mastectomy this time), radiation will reduce it by one third. I am glad to hear people say it's easy after chemo, because I haven't had too bad a time with chemo, but, whatever, reducing the risk of recurrence by a third is something that is very persuasive to me.",

      "Content": "There is not much you can do about what to expect with a mastectomy, so maybe they don't think it's important to fill you in. And, of course, everyone is different. But here are the things I wish I had known: the scar will look really awful at first, but it definitely gets a lot better. Resolves into a nice little line. When the breast goes, so do the nerves. Your chest will be more or less numb, although some feeling comes back gradually. Occasionally some \"phantom\" sensations, too. They take a lot of tissue from under the arm (at least for me) and it will take a lot of stretching to get your range of motion back. Ask them when, not if, you can start physical therapy. Sometimes the scar is very hard and tight, and your physical therapist will massage it, as well as stretching the arm. Breaking up the scar tissue helps with range of motion. I didn't know what to wear at first, and no one had any suggestions. Nice that you can stay home for a while -- just put on a soft cotton shirt and be comfortable. Pin your drain bulb(s) to a soft ribbon around your neck during your shower, and let the ribbon hang to dry before the next shower. I had very, very little pain. I think I took a painkiller only once. Everyone is different, and if it hurts you should take painkillers -- but don't let anticipation of pain make you miserable. You won't be able to sleep on that side for several months. To my mind, that's an argument for doing one side at a time, because sleeping on my back means not really sleeping. Good luck -- my thoughts are with you.",

      "Content": "I agree that gel inserts probably won't cut it. Custom orthotics (insurance should pay) and maybe cortisone injections. Plus -- and this is the most important thing -- stretching. Put your hands against the wall, put your foot back, and bend the knee of your front leg. Hold it for 10-15 seconds. Repeat 10-15 times, three times a day, on both sides. Feel the stretch in the back of your knee. This really makes all the difference. Helps it feel better and keeps it from coming back.",

      "Content": "I can relate to your story. I fell completely in love with two aquatic turtles, red-eared sliders, brought home from college by separate kids. Each needed his/her own tank. Thank goodness we had a large kitchen island, with room at one end for the turtles. They ate from my hand, and the male loved to be petted and held. They have both moved on to other homes, and I would not seek out a turtle (lots of work), but I completely understand how attached you can become to a cold-blooded creature. RIP Fluffy.",
