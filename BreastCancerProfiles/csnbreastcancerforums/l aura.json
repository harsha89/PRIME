    "Content": "Hi Ruthie; I was diagnosed with extnsive DCIS (stage 0) and one small tumor of Invasive ductal cancer (stage 1). I could have opted for another lumpectomy and followed it up with radiation if they got clear margins. However, I opted for the more aggressive rout of bi-lateral mastectomy even though there was no cancer in my other breast. I am in the midst of reconstruction with expanders in right now. I have ABSOLUTELY no regrets. I feel that i took the best route to avoid a reoccurence and cosmetically it was the right choice- once I am done. It is a scary proposition; however, I believe it was right for me. Everyone is different- so think about all of the variables and make peace with your decision. Good luck!! Laura",
