    "Content": "Greetings, all - today marks one week with one breast, I am now cancer free with no chemo and no radiation. I'm wondering about finding a support group here in DC. I am emotionally raw and trying to live in the moment, but as each day wears on I get real pissed off about pain that doesn't stop and muscles that cease up. Mostly I bark at my husband then feel bad. I'm pretty sure I need a support group, but I've heard mixed reviews - anyone care to comment? TIA, Rave",
