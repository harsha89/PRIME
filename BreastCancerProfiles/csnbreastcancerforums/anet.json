    "Content": "Hi everyone! It is always so nice to be able to come here to talk to you guys. It has been about 1.5 months since my mastectomy/reconstruction. I have been told that I might have capsule contracture (scar tissue surrounding my expanders). My expanders have ended up very far apart(about 4 inches and I have a very small frame) and they are very hard. The Dr told me that he will know for sure after the next surgery. He said that if I have the condition, it does not mean that it will happen again with the implants. I have read that saline and textured implants are better to try to avoid capsule contracture. Does anybody experience or heard of this? Hugs! Anet",
