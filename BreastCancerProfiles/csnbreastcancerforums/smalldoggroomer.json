I know I have to discuss this with my Oncologist but have any of you opted not to have radiation? Does it really increase the odds enough of no recurrence later? I know you can get really burned by it. It is everyday for at least a month. I have to drive a hour each way. I just don't know if this will be worth it. If the Doc, tells me it increases your chances of no recurrence by 2% I don't think I will do it. But if it is 50% then there is no question I would have to do it. But then radiation causes cancer. I have scare tissue in my lungs from years of smoking ( I quite 8 years ago ) Can the radiation affect that turn it into cancer?? Sorry about the rambling",
