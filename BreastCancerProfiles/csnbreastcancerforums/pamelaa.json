      "Content": "How does she feel about tx options? Is she active and of sound mind. I would support whtever she is comfortable with. I am a hospice nurse and have seen many older patients who ignore breast ca, few pass from the illness. Older people tend to have a much slower metabolism and therefore ca is not usually very aggressive. My grandmother was diagnosed at 80 and lived to be 91! I have a auny who is 96 , active, and in good health but know she would choose to forgo anything aggressive. I would do whatever she wants and stand by that without second guessing the decision. As a nurse, I am realistic and look at the quality of life. What will be gained by intervention and what effect will it have on her life. I myself have breast ca and had a bilateral masectomy 10 days ago. Recovery has not been too bad, but i am half her age! Good luck and i will keep your family in my prayers! Pam",
