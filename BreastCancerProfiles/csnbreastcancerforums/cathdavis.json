      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I've been checking this site each day and responding when I could relate to the message because of my own knowledge and experience. This site has taught me so much...mostly that you are there whenever anyone needs some bolstering! I'm in that position now. I got a good report from my onc and blood work for my 6 mos checkup. However I am menopausal and I had some spotting in July. The gyn saw me this week and I had an ultrasound today. My endrometrial lining is thicker than it should be so they want to do a biopsy. I've had this before....ouch! Of course everyone says don't worry, but that's what they told me when I had my breast biopsy and since then I've had a mastectomy of my rt breast. I know I shouldn't worry, but I'm so scared. It helps to vent here...thanks for listening! Cathy",

      "Content": "I just had a silicone implant done. Yes, you do have to be in the study, but it's not anything to be concerned about in my opinion. So far I am very happy with my implant and it is quite natural feeling and looking. Of course I had a super plastic surgeon! Be sure you are comfortable with the dr you choose; that's very important. Good luck. Cathy",
