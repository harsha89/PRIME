    "Content": "I can only relate to the 'prickly' feeling - after my surgery (lumpectomy/sentinel node) my arm, armpit and parts of my breast have that burning/prickly sensation. what is a pain the most is even just touching those sections hurts. My oncologist says it the nerve endings firing and not connecting. I'm hoping it goes away soon - even hugging my b'friend is painful at times. hope you feel better soon too! hugsssssssss - sharon",
