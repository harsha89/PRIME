      "Content": "Finally had my long awaited GYN appointment to discuss having my ovaries out. She actually suggested going one step further and remove the uterus as well. This can all be done vaginally with the aide of abdomenal laprascope and instruments. Anyone consider this or have it done? I am aiming for surgery the beginning of April. After being menopausal for 13 months with no side effects to speak of, my period is back with a vengence AND I now have such drastic hormonal mood swings. I was sobbing in her office (I happened to get my period just minutes before leaving my house for the appointment!) I was actually glad she got to see me at my worst. Mainly I'm doing this because I want to stay on the Arimidex and I don't want to take the Lupron shots. Susan",

      "Content": "Hi travanelli. You've got to go with your gut feelings. I knew from the beginning that I would have reconstruction. My situation was similar to yours. I had a mastectomy, chemo & radiation as well. It was a little over a year when I was reconstructed with a TRAM flap. Right afterwards I was almost sorry I had done it. It hurt like heck!!! It's like having a baby though, you forget a lot. I think any good plastic surgeon will tell you that having an implant under radiated skin is not your best option. Stretching that damaged skin is a risk. Get a couple of opinions, make a pro and con list and do what feels right to you. Good luck. Susan",

I had my vision tested and it's unchanged. The nurse at my support group is always telling us that our eyes should be checked because, yes, chemo does affect the eyesight. Definitely go for a checkup and mention your treatment to the dr. Hope all goes well. Susan",

      "Content": "I have 10 more weeks of Herceptin left. I never attributed joint stiffness or muscle soreness to it though; thought that was more caused by the tamoxifen I'm on (I will be switching to Arimidex soon though) Have you been getting Tylenol and benedryl with the herceptin like tulip? After my 12 treatments along with the taxol, I've just gotten the herceptin alone. I think being thrown into early menopause causes a lot of symptoms as well, we can never be certain what the culprit is. Hang in there. Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, When I first started treatment I was premenopausal (I'm 47). After about 6 mos. of not having a period, I asked to have the hormonal tests done to check my status. When it showed that I was in menopause, I started reading all the studies regarding the aromatase inhibitors. To me they seemed to be more effective and a more aggressive treatment. After discussing it with my doctor, he agreed to switch me over. I haven't switched yet since that was right before my reconstructive surgery two weeks ago. I didn't want to confuse my body any more than I was about to so I'll make the change in a few weeks when I'm feeling more like myself again. What is the actual trial number you are involved with? There are a number of them going on, I wonder if we are in the same one. Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Trixielee, I am also stage III, ER-, but PR+ and HER2+. Like JKAlley I got herceptin by entering a trial. The trials are now closed but you should find it easy enough to get an oncologist to give it to you. Make sure you have them administer it along with taxol (or taxotere) for maximum punch. The website that was mentioned is her2support.org . I highly recommend it, lots of info and knowledgeable folks there. Herceptin has changed what for us was a \"poor prognosis\" into a GOOD prognosis! Lots of hope, don't dispair! I'm 2 1/2 yrs. out now and no sign of problems. What is your treatment program? Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Jean. So sorry to hear of your heart problems. I always knew herceptin was toxic to the heart, but I guess some of us are more prone to it than others. I am surprised that your onc. wasn't ordering a MUGA or echo to keep tabs on your heart health, especially since you are also still taking chemo. One good thing about being in a clinical trial is that things like that are built into the treatment plan. Although I was the one to initiate my referral to a cardiologist when my EF got down to 51. The heart meds he prescribed have kept my EF level and have helped keep my blood pressure under control (it was never too high maybe in the 130's/90's). What has your pressure and pulse been? I can't imagine it's been normal. Does the cardiologist think any permanent damage has been done? Would he entertain the idea of restarting the herceptin once things are under control? You are so right that being a patient these days takes a lot of research, knowledge and persistance. It still amazes me that even the best of doctors still don't always see the big picture. We have to be on top of things at all times. I hope your treatments get back on track smoothly and you experience no more bumps in the road. Take care. Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Linda. I am Her2 positive, stage IIIa, one lymph node positive. I had an 8cm tumor. I had a mastectomy and then entered a clinical trial testing herceptin on non-met. cancers. Had 4 rounds of AC, then 12 wkly treatments of taxol w/ herceptin, then 40 of herceptin alone. Just finished July 29th. I'm now on a 3 month checkup schedule at the oncologist for the first year (blood draws at each appt.), then it extends to 4 mos/yr, 6 mos/yr, then yearly. You should also see your Gyn at least yearly or 2x/yr and your surgeon every 6 mos. I also had radiation so that's another doctor I see 2x/yr. You should set it up so that you see one of the doctors every three months, that way between them and you doing exams, anything will be picked up early. Also try to push for an MRI along with your mammo since we are now in the high risk category. What care have you been receiving the last year? Susan",
