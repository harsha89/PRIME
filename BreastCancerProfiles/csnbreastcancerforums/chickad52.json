I've had 2 echocardiagrams and all is fine. I just had 2 treatments of Taxol/Herceptin and I had alot of palpitations this past week. The doc is sending me to a heart doc tomorrow to have a 24 hr. halter moniter put on. Mention your racy heart as they will want to keep an eye on things!! Good Luck Diane:)",
