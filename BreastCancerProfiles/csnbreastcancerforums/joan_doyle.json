      "Content": "Hi i will be starting this treatment down the road on A/C at the moment - me a firm believer in foods to relieve problems have herbal book - figs:- eat raw or dry figs as the seed of the fig help push waste materials through the system, and also act as a laxative prunes:- are a laxative apples: can fast clean the system Spinach:- raw spinach salads add needed vitamins and minerals to a diet and act in a slightly laxative fashion (or just eat raw) Strawberries:- are slightly laxative. I find loose sweet corn a great man for bowl movement. Hot water drank and plenty of water thro' out day also try to include natural bi yoghurts (to get good bacteria into the system again ) if these foods don't suit try a selection of fruits with the yoghurt - and only go when you have to don't sit for too long trying - hope this is of help thinng of you Cheers Joan",

      "Content": "I like Mamma G - go natural - like you just began recently on A/C had long curly thick hair yes nearly gone heading for 3rd treatment - i like to think let nature take its course and yes i have a quite a good few strand left but not enough to go public with unless they want me in a scary movie eh! my head does'nt itch or hurt and the only problems are the loss of weight and balance to the hairless head and the cold every now and then for me I have a problem with hairy legs all my life and the shaving can irrate the skin and this is just another place less to shave for me - as Mamma G said it is also a nice cushion for the wig and gives your sides at the ears a bit more natural look etc and it is lovely to still see a bit of your own hair - it picking them up is the darn nuisance? - Maybe try this way first and if it does't suit you can still always shave Cheers and will be thinking of you Joan",
