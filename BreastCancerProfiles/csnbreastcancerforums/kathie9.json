      "Content": "Hi Karen Rose...my memories are of my right boob..which is now artificial. (A nice firm, round one). My surgery was last August 9th and I too healed nicely. I then went thru 4 rounds of chemo, Cytoxin & Adriamycin..Hair started to fall out in 4 weeks after chemo started. Even though I knew it was going to happen, it was still a shock. bought a wig, but only wore it a few times. I went hat crazy. Had fun with them. At least I was hairless during the cold months. As far as work goes, it will depend on you. I went back to work part time 6 weeks after surgery 5 hours a day instead of my usual 8 or 9 hours. (they loved my hats at work) When I had chemo I took three days off. The first day of chemo was o.k., but the second & third were worse for me. Continued to work part time. Luckily I had excellent benefits which afforded me the luxury of time off with pay. I continued part time until the first of the year and have been back full time ever since. Sounds like you have the right attitude to get you through this. Your body will tell you how much you can do..just take the time to listen to it. Take care of yourself and god bless.",
