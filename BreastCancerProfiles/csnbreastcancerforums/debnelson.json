    "Content": "I am a survivor for 16 years. In the past year I have developed a lump near my surgical area. Had all the testing to find out it is not cancer. It hurts whenever I do too much (which is just about everything, smile), want to know if any other survivors are experiencing problems with these lumps. Someone in Va has a swelling in her upper arm which is so bad she cannot lift it. If you are a survivor and have experienced any problems like this, with or without success, please let me know. Been to many mds with no success in decreasing the size or removing it. On much meds now and still experiencing pain. Can you identify?",
