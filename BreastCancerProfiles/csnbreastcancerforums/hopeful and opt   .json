    "Content": "Since I have prostate cancer, I generally post at that forum, however, today, my 91 year old mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer. She lives in northern new jersey, just outside new york city. She has used Englewood, New Jersey Hospital in the past and is happy with the , I believe regional hospital. Today, she underwent various tests at the hospital where she was diagnosed. The doctors that she and my brother spoke with told her that there would be an outpatient procedure, that there would be no kemo or that she would not loss a breast. Her cardiolist, who she trusts recommended a Dr.Sussmam to do the surgery. I don't know anything about this doctors credentials, background or successes, or do I think my mother. Any decision if of course my mothers especially since I live in ca and my mother is very independent, however I believe that there is a nationally known hospital, Sloan Kettering in NYC, for the treatment of cancer. I don't know who the better and more experienced doctors for this procedure are at htis institution, also there may be other hospitals in the NYC or Northern NJ area that specialize in the treatment of breast cancer. Hopefully you can recommend others and the better doctor at these institutions. Thanks Ira",
