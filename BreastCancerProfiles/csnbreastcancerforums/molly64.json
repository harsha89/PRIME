    "Content": "I found out last week that my breast cancer (in remission for 39 months) has metastasized to my bones (severe backaches last month led me to bone scans which showed my bones lit up like a Christmas tree). My onc prescribed radiation for the most painful pelvic area and Xgeva to help \"cement\" my bones and an oral chemo called Xeloda (2 weeks on and one week off-8 500mg pills per day). Problem is my BC/BS insurance is dragging their heels \"pending review\" of my Xeloda treatment and I am so angry because I know that every day delayed is another day for the cancer to spread. I have talked to many levels of BC/BS insurance management and my onc's nurse has called also but nothing seems to help speed up the approval process. Frustrated, angry, upset and worried. What if they don't approve the Xeloda? It's the weekend and no one at BC/BS is working on my case!!!!",
