      "Content": "When people maintain their \"normal\" weight while on chemo, it enables them to recouperate faster following treatment.  it makes it easier for your body to keep your body functions and body repair systems functioning near normal. If you try to lose weight, it can mess with these functions and that isn't good.  Personally, i looked at being told not to diet as one of the few yippee moments during treatment. I demanded an ice cream treat following each infusion.  ",

      "Content": "hi and welcome to this club no one wants to belong to. My advice would be to follow what's already been said-especially the hydration and asking for anti nausea meds before chemo.  The chemo center I went to had hand outs with things to watch for, what to do to remedy it, and a reminder that not everyone gets the same reaction.  The oncology nurses are also great resources for information. Just remember that you can do this, you are tougher than you think.    ",
