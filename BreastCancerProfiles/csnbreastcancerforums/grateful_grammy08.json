    "Content": "I will definately pray your margins come back good. But if they don't you should really consider having your breast removed. I opted to have the lumpectomy first and during the wait for the pathology report I had a bad reaction to the dye they used to traced my lymph nodes (lymph nodes good). So the surgeon had to go back in and remove more breast tissue. I thought I would still be able to save my breast with having to have minimal reconstructive surgery. Well a few days after the 2nd surgery I got the pathology report back and the cancer was 100% to the margins, and had to have my breast removed anyway. So I had to go thru another surgery for no reason. But in the end to feel the releif I did knowing all the cancer was gone, I kinda wish I would have opted for the masectomy in the first place. Good luck to you and I'll keep you in my prayers!! Grammy",
