      "Content": "actually i think i may be developing the same problem. i am much earlier in the process getting my second round of chemo next week. but i developed a \"seroma\" in my axilla after a lymph node dissection (7 of 35 nodes were microscopically positive) that has become quite large at times requiring drainage by the surgeon. the area under the fluid collection feels thick. there is no way to tell how much of the fluid is serum from the surgical bed site and how much is lymph. the surgeon tells me that eventually scar tissue will form and the accumulation of the fluid will slow and then stop. but it has been going on since mid february. i keep telling myself that this is the least of my problems right now.",
