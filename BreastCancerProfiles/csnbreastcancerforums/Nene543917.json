    "Content": "Hi, I do think like someone said that the Tamoxifen does make more sun sensitive.  The fact that we have also had radiation also adds to the equation. The rash that everyone os talking about is most likely a contact dermatitis. I had that during my radiation treatment. Itchy as heck and I had to get a special medication to alleviate the symptoms. Hope this helps.  Nene  ",
