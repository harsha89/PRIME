    "Content": "I am on day 19 of tch, and my head got itchy 2 days ago. Yesterday, it started coming out very slowly. Today it is coming out by the handfuls. I have super thick hair, so my thought was to wait it out. Was going to cut it short, but the hairdresser is on vac. Not crazy all falling on the floor, just comes out in my fingers when I touch it. Not big blotchy pieces, just random pieces together. Hope that helps, and hope you feel better soon.",
