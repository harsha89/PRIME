    "Content": "We are brainwashed into not questioning the medical profession. I started www.just-say-no-to-chemo.blogspot.com last night. I have refused traditional toxic treatment, and instead of taking in toxins, I am building up immunity. [My personal opinion is that] anything that actually causes your hair to fall out cannot possibly be good. And we have all just accepted this as \"normal\". It is not normal and it is not acceptable. Read the cancertutor.com and other websites. I am not an expert. I am learning about this on my own. But we MUST question and learn, otherwise, traditional medicine will kill us.
