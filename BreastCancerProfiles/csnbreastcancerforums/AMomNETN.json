      "Content": "Annie, I almost started a post like this a couple of weeks ago. I think it is worse in the summer cuz so much is showing. I've had reconstruction but you are right it isn't the same. The only up side is that I don't have to wear a bra. I always wonder if the women realize how lucky they are to still have their breasts. I wouldn't trade my life for them but I can't help but wish I'd never met this cancer. Thanks for the post. Janie",

It helps flush out the nicotine and stuff quicker. Just find something else to do in place of smoking, gum, sugar-free candy, drugs, etc. I hope this helps. Janie",

First I didn't want to go thru 2 mastecomies and second for reconstruction it is easier for them to be symentical. This is your choice and do what it right for you. I agree with the others that you are more important than boobs. They are just a very small part of you. I've created a new oxymoron tho, I call my implants that they are my \"real fakes\". I'm getting those the end of this month. Janie",

      "Content": "I finished chemo in July 10. I had Taxotere and carboplatin. It isn't quite as scary as we think it will be. My chemo day started with breakfast and as much water as mucch as I could drink. Actually it is a good idea to drink as much water as you can for 2-3 days before. Get there had blood work then off to chemo. I got steriods, aloxi (for nausea) and ativan. Then the fun began. Mine site had soft drinks, snacks, warmed blankets.I'd take a book or computer. My nurses were super nice and took excellent care of all of us. You'll talk to others around you and get to know them. I also ate lemonheads to help with the test in my mouth. You will stay up from the steriods then about the 3rd day it hits you. You will be tired probably just want to sleep. Listen to your body. I had a Neulasta on the Mon. after chemo on Fri. I always felt it was worse than chemo. I hope this helps. Just ask as many questions as you need to. The women here are great. I'm not sure I'd have made it without their experiences. We are all different so you may have some of our side effects, or different ones. I always remember that a lot of women talked about having diarehea and I had to opposite. See all different but the same. Most important things said, listen to your body, and drink drink drink that water. Janie",

There should be a number in your phone book that can tell you where a meeting is. I called that number, they told me where a meeting was. I went and then got a schedule for other meetings in my town. I found a women's group that has seen me through everything for the past 7 yrs. Just go and listen, you don't have to say anything if you don't want too. I went to meetings for 4-6 months before I ever spoke or admitted I was an alcoholic. In a way AA is like this site, they know where you've been and where you can go if you want to do the work. I'm not sure I could have made it through treatment with cancer if I'd been drinking. I was shocked that I didn't drink when I found out I had cancer but I didn't. :-) I hope this helps but like our cancer journey, becoming clean and sober reqires hard work and people who understand what you are going through. Believe it or not we actually laugh at these meetings. Feel free to PM me. I wish you the best in the next phase of your journey.",

I was fine with it because it gave me time to heal from the 1st surgery. You didn't mention if you had to have chemo or rads. That would play into it also. I had chemo with fill ups just before my next treatment. About 4 months after chemo was over I had the exchange surgery. It wasn't a difficult as the mastectomy to me anyway. Kids grown so that wasn't a consideration. I really don't have any cons to my surgeries. I hope this helps a little bit. Janie",

I was told I'd have a new \"normal\" from now on and they were very right. Once you get the diagnois nothing is ever \"normal\" again. I'm slowing learning that I'm 1st. I hope you can find a support group in your area. I have and they have been a wonderful asset for me through all this. I don't think your surgeon was necessarily tactless maybe it was his way of saying things were as they should be at that point. Keep venting we're here.",

It is a slow process all the way around. I'm about 6 months since last treatment. I have my hair back (could qualify for military), tingling and numbness gone, except sometimes I notice it in my feet when I shower. The swelling went away about 3 months. Took Laxic for that for several months. I know patience is hard but it is worth it. I was lucky to have good friends and family. Look for a breast support group in your area. Try the ACS to get info. Good Luck and keep on coming back here. There is a world of knowledge and experience from all the women. Janie",
