      "Content": "I was 47 when diagnosed, the surgery was the easiest part, then the onco type results came high, i almost fainted when i was told i had to take the citoxan/taxol combo, it's been rough since last may until now and the pill so far is the worst - something very honest from my onco before the treatments started was that i could've gotten all the benefits from chemo with just two rounds, i took three to make everybody happy at home, then 38 rads and the pill, so far all is good, i just took my mammo and came clear, pain and suffering from femara is no picnic but having my hair back and a clean mammo is way worth it, good luck with your decision",

      "Content": "I never needed them, when i had my chemo sessions they put me anti-nausea as a shot in my IV and that was enough - never got nauseated, i had them but had no need of them trough the whole ordeal - try to go easy w/food for the 1st week then start to increase a little bit more the next 2, your body will tell you - if you just follow a very soft diet for the 5 to 6 first days after your infussion like soups, cackers, toast, rice, fruit and plenety of drinks, you will probably don't need any med, mention this to your onco on your next appoint.",
