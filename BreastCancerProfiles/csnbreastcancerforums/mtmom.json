      "Content": "I just ordered my scarf since I'm going back to chemo. There is a spot on the order form where they ask for your story. In a couple of days I got a reply that my scarf will be coming, but they also sent along the nicest note and hopeful words. Very good people to work with! ~Mtmom",

      "Content": "Roberta, I'm in the boat with you. We stopped chemo early because I got neuropathy (July 2013). We are blessed to have a naturopathic doctor who sees patients through the cancer center and so I use her alot! I'll tell you what I use, but please check with your doctors or if you can see a naturopath I would recommend that. I have been on Vitamin B6 since I started chemo and then added Lipoic Acid before Taxol started. I'm not taking the LA right now since I've been doing radiation, but I will start back with it again 3 weeks after treatment. I also have an essential oil massage blend from Doterra that is supposed to help with circulation. I still have numbness and tingling, but the pain has subsided quite a bit. And, I think it is fairly common to have to wait several months to see improvement. Your body has been to war...make sure and rest when you need it, exercise, eat, and stay hydrated! Blessings, ~Mtmom",

      "Content": "Good day! New here...diagnosed in March with IDC and just finished radiation treatment on Oct.30, 2013. Just found this group and wanted to ask you warriors about rad burns. I have burns on my neck, a couple spots on my back, and my armpit is hamburger! I guess I'm just looking for some ideas to get through the pain and mess. I also have Type 1 Diabetes (I'm 44 and have had it for 30yrs.) so I'm sure that doesn't help. Questions: a) keep the area dry, b) keep the area moist, c) how long before you saw improvement, d) best/worst products. Thanks to all of you who have gone before and are able to share some warfare wisdom. It helps tremendously! Blessings, ~Mtmom",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear about your news. I, too, was just diagnosed with mets...to the liver and lymph nodes. While I'm barely a year out from the breast cancer diagnosis I have had Type 1 diabetes for 32 years. I'm not sure what the Herceptin will do to your blood sugar. But, if you take any type of an IV cortisone that will really mess your sugars up! I just saw my diabetes educator today to begin a game plan for keeping sugars down during treatment. Do you have access to someone like that? Check with your endrocrinologist's office. You will want to be monitoring closely. Many blessings, ~Mtmom",
