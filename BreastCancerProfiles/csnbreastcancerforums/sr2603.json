    "Content": "It is you call whether you refuse treatment or not. Just make sure you understand your patholgoy report/tumor type and what could possibly happen if you dont have chemo. If you are borderline or may onle benefit 1-2% then it may be wise to refuse treatment. On the other hand if you had an aggrressive invasive tumor type you may seriously wish to reconsider and have the treatment. As for hair, thankfully it grows back in. Yes, its traumatic losing it, but no pain no gain. I lost my hair twice so far. The side effects of chemo are not great, I know from experience having had it 5 years ago and having been on it permanently this past 2 years, but if it clears up the cancer, it is worth a shot. As for expense, dont worry about that! Speak to a social worker at the cancer center. Dont let a bad hair day or finances be the deciding factor. Its your life thats on the line here. Good luck in your decision.",
