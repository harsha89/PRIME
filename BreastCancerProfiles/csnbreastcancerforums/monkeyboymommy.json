      "Content": "Hi Zachey: I have been tamoxifen for 7 months now, and I totally understand about the emotional rollercoaster ride. Its not too much fun, and I have a six year old boy! Whatever has been bothering me lately I have chalked up to the meds. They are strong and powerful, they always say its the cure that kills ya! (A little bit of gallows humor). Anyway, if it makes you feel better, I understand and am in the same boat. I am too frightened of coming off the drug. I imagine the chance of recurrance as the \"bogeyman\" in my life right now. I take anti anxiety meds too so that is helping me to stay almost straight. Hope this helps and that you are feeling better soon.",
