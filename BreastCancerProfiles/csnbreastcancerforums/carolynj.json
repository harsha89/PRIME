      "Content": "I just discovered this site and am new to it. Had a lumpectomy on Jan, 14 with radiation treatments following. During routine xray for BC, 2 nodules were found in my lungs. After BC surgery, CT scan, PET scan and lung biopsy determined I had lung cancer. Good news was that it was not from the breast. Had the larger left lobe removed on April 8, 02. No chemo or radiation necessary. I'm feeling good and hope to continue to enjoy life after BC and lung cancer. Be positive everyone. Carolyn",

      "Content": "Dear Judy, You'll be in my prayers for tomorrow's PET scan and also for positive outcome of the scan. Have you had a PET scan before? They're not painful at all, not like a biopsy. I've had two this year and will be scheduled for another one to check lesion in my liver. Take it one day at a time Judy, you're going to do fine. We'll all be praying that the results will be good news. Hugs from Carolyn",

Please send prayers and positive thoughts today for positive results from the biopsy. Thanks for your continued support and good wishes. I hope you're all doing great on this day of remembrance.
