    "Content": "I am 4 yrs out from my chemo and also had some dental problems. I ended up losing much of the bone that held my front teeth and had to have them pulled and a bridge put in. I had some bone lost before the cancer, but it was much worse after the chemo. Also the sensitive spots. Just be aware that this is not unusal and make sure that the dentist understands your medical history.",
