      "Content": "I'm not sure if surgical menopause is any different from chemo induced? I went through the crazy hot flashes, mood swings, and total OMG I'm instantly old LOL. I'm 40 so it was all a big change for me. I try to make humor out of everything myself Traci, it keeps us from breaking down right? I told my surgeon when I went in for my mastectomy he was \"breast taking\" lol...that helps me feel in control. It's been since October 2016 since I've had a cycle or any memory of being a fertile lady, but on a side note the hot flashes and misery have subsided. Once everything calms down, you'll be celebrating no more .... <-- Yea those dreaded periods! Stay strong and I'm so thankful I've found a site with others going through some of the same craziness I have. Tam",

      "Content": "Those khaki pants probably feel awesome! I actually had them prescribe me effexor for the hot flashes, not to mention it's an antidepressant. It worked when I need it to, but if you decide to go off of it...be leery the side effects. I actually should have allowed them to taper my dose, but I'm not one for taking things slow lol. So quitting cold turkey wasn't the best method. I would definitely check about that though, may bring you some relief. Watch that parmesan cheese LOLÂ  Tam",
