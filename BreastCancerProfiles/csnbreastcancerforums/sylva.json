      "Content": "I went to the oncologist for the 3 months check up, and I was having a pain close to the ribs, on and off, so he ordered a CTSCan. He called me and said that something is under the arm, the side I had the mastectomy, that needs an U/S, something shows in the uterus and sth small in the lung. And I am very nervous now, finished with the chemo at the end of June, diagnosed in March/08, and now... what to expect? I know I need to cool down, and don't get so crazy over this... Took the morning off from work, did yoga, try to get again into the positive side. Hugs",

      "Content": "What an experience!!! I'm so grateful that I was able to attend this event in between chemo treatments. The survivor Lap was so emotional, with all these people cheering and applauding, and walking with my husband and some friends, all holding hands. And the luminary was something I will never forget, all walking in silence, and all these lights, representing lives... I met this 16 year survivor lady, all happy, and sharing and hugging me!! I didn't want to leave, so I continue walking the track so many times, that the day after my legs hurt so much!! I already put my name FOR NEXT YEAR, I want to volunteer and be a one year survivor story for another new diagnosed person as I was this year.",
