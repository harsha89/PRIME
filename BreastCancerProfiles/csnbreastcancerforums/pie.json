    "Content": "I will be starting TCH next week and my oncologist gave me a booklet which included diet dos and don'ts. Does this mean I am confined to that diet throughout the 18 weeks that I will be on that chemo? Can I try other foods? There's not much variety on the list and the only meats are chicken and broiled lean beef. Please give me some hope because otherwise I will be having a Thanksgiving chicken dinner.",
