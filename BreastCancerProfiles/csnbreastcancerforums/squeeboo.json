      "Content": "Hi bunnie, I finished chemo in mid-september. My hair had already started growing back a few weeks before that, but it was very thin and grew slowly. About 2 months after the last chemo is when it really started growing normally. By the middle of December, never wore my wig again. Losing hair sucks and waiting for it to grow back is painfully slow, but looking back, I had to really think about how long it took and was surprised to realize that I finished chemo over six months ago. Though I wouldn't want to go through it again, I did get some good pictures of the teal and purple mohawk my friends shaved for me before my second chemo (it was pretty cool). Hope this helps!",
