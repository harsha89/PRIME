      "Content": "Hi There. . I too have had a recurrence of breast cancer. Have just finished my first round of taxotere, and have some great news for you. The dietician at John Muir Cancer Center recommended \"Glutamine\". . .It is an amino acid,that protects and restores the cells ruined in the digestive system. I did not receive my order until two days after my first treatment, and had nausea, and diarhea. I started taking it on the third day, and have been feeling great since. I take it everyday (it's in powdered form, no taste) with my morning protein drink. Please ask your oncologist, or dietician about this stuff. . I can't say enough good things about it. Also, . .I did Adriamycin/Cytoxan with my first B/C diagnosis, and it was much tougher than just the taxotere. Good luck. .. hang in there. Suzanne",
