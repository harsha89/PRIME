    "Content": "I was under the impression that my appetite would be sacrificed with chemo. I am having the opposite \"problem\". I want to eat everything in sight. Granted, I have only had one treatment of 6 so far. I guess my appetite will change furter on down the line. If it doesn't, I will be a blimp by the time my treatments are over. In the meantime, I am being selfish and enjoyng all the comfort food I can. Simple pleasures, you know!!",
