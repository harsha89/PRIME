I have copies of all my test results and asked a bunch of questions. I found an error in one of my mammogram reports after surgery. It said my cancer was in the right breast when it was the left. I made them revise it so it would be correct. Sher",

Grade 3 cancers are more likely to grow fast. This along with it's stage, 0 being lowest and 4 being the highest, and size of tumer determines the treatment. Having no node involvement is great. Sounds like yours was caught early. I am stage 1C, grade 3, no nodes, estrogen and progesterone positive, and HER2 positive. Like you, I had a partial mastectomy, chemo, radiation, one year of herceptin, now 5 years of Tamoxifen to disable the hormones that my cancer feeds on. None of it was (is) fun, but it's doable.

By following simple advice heard on the Oprah show, you too can find inner peace. Dr. Oz proclaimed, 'The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started and have never finished.' So, I looked around my house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished, and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle of Tequila, a package of Oreos, the remainder of my old Prozac prescription, the rest of the cheesecake, some Doritos, and a box of chocolates. You have no idea how freaking good I feel right now! Pass this on if you know anyone you think might be in need of inner peace. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!",
