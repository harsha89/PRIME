      "Content": "Lesley is finally home and the hospice nurse is great. We had some friends come over and help and spent some time with Lesley for her birthday. Lesley is a bit more alert, but still fades in and out of consciousness. I was however able to speak to her about the hospice and she was saddened that her condition has deteriorated so fast. The hospice nurses informed me that her hallucinations are a combination of the pain medications and the cancer in the brain that are causing her incoherent status. I asked if her condition will improve with the change of medications, but they said we will have to wait and see. I needed to know in order to have my girls come back from their grandma's house later or should I not let anymore time pass and have them spend as much time with their mommy as possible. I just wanted my girls to have quality time with their mommy, but it seems that Lesley's current status is about as good as it is going to get before it gets worse. Thank you all for the prayers and the loving kind words and wisdom you all have shared with my family, I only wish you all could have met my wife before this monster took over. I know that heaven was flooded with her name being lifted up and I know that Lesley will be in the arms of the Lord soon enough and will no longer be in pain or suffering. Eternally thankful and forever grateful, Thomas",

      "Content": "Well, today was a really bad day. While at the ONC office today we discovered that my wife has not had a bowel movement since she does not know when. The ONC and RN agreed that an anti-nausea drip would not help and that the constipation along with the flu that my 2 boys had over the weekend was the reason for the vomiting along with taking oxycotin instead of oxycodone for breakthrough pain. If this was not enough, my wife's face became numb on her right side and I noticed that her left eye started drifting up and looked like a lazy eye. I called the RN and he got the ONC, who then had the staff call the ambulance. The concern was that my wife was having a stroke. Once at the ER the neurologist agreed with the ER DR that it was not a stroke, but Bell's Palsy and that the cause is not known, but it is probably not related to the cancer, but ONC had them do a CT scan anyway. Well, something was there in the brain near the spinal cord near the #5 nerve and not the #7 which is the one that controls the facial part. Next step was the spinal tap to get a sample of the fluid and now we WAIT for a couple of days to get the results. ONC is pretty certain, given her history with the cancer, that it is cancer related and that it is treatable with chemo directly into the spinal cord. My teenage daughter was with us, because she was showing her Mommy that she can drive on the freeway and that she is prepared for this weekends trip to the grandparents house for the birthday party (have to take 2 cars to fit everyone). This was so SCARY for her and once we got home my other 2 daughters saw their Mommy with her face droopy on one side and can't close her left eye all the way and now she mumbles and says incoherent things. I have called a good friend of mine and vented, but man can we just get a break, I mean just a couple of months, weeks, days, SOMETHING!!!! Thanks for reading and lots of luck to those that are having just a bad day as us. God Bless you all, Hugs and prayers.",
