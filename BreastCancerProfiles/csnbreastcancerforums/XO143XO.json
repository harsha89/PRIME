    "Content": "OMG! That really makes me mad. I am so sorry that happened to you. There is no excuse for that nurse to treat you like that and I hope you are able to discuss it with the doctor. Hopefully, you will get reassurance from the doctor (A) The nurse will never treat you or anyone like that again, and (B) The doctor treats you the way you deserve to be treated, if not you may want to consider changing doctors. Personally, I have to have confidence in my doctor's ability but I also need and deserve someone that takes the time to be there for me when I need them. The good news is that you found this wonderful, supportive, group! Keep us posted and remember you have freinds here that understand. Kristi xoxox",
