    "Content": "I was diagnosed w/DCIS last June. Had lumpectomy in September. Started rads for 6 weeks in Oct. and now I have been on tamoxifen for 6 months. After rads were finished, I continue to see by breast surgeon (who sends me for follow-up mammos and ultrasounds and in another 6 months I am going for a breast MRI). Being on tamoxifen, my gynocologist is sending me for pelvic/transvaginal ultrasounds. I just saw my breast surgeon this past week and I have another appt. in January.",
