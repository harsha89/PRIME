    "Content": "I went thru the same thing May 2001.Sounds like you are doing real good and have a positive outlook which the Dr.s say is great. This time next year you will wonder where the time went! It depends on what chemo you get and how much if you are able to work . Everyone is not the same , depends on what stage your are and how healthy you are to begin with. My friend from Canada was one treatment ahead of me and had such great humor. She would e-mail me and joke how she was leaving a trail, with her hair falling out in the house. The best medicine is humor and it sounds like you have it. Laugh as much as you can.",
