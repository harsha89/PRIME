    "Content": "I'm a BRCA1 positive. Stage IIB breast cancer in right breast. I'd a strong family history too. SO they gave me no other option but the bilateral mastectomy. I'm currently on Tissue Expanders as my chemo is going on. Once the Chemo is over, I'll have the permanent implants. Does any one experience the same? The breast skin is preserved and is alive but the nerves got damaged I guess. Good luck to you!",
