    "Content": "Hi, My friend Anne has been recently diagnosed. She is a couple of weeks away from surgery and one of the many questions she has is around shaving after she has lymph nodes removed. She has heard that she won't be able to shave under her arms, and wants to know whether electrolysis is a good option. And, does she need to do it before chemo or radiation (like the dental work she's having done now) or can she wait until afterward?",
