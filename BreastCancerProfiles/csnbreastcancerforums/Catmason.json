    "Content": "What a relief it is to see that my frustration with Tamoxifen is not exclusive to me. I have always been able to control my weight - I was an athlete in high school so exercise has always been part of the picture and when I diet, I am dedicated. It seems now that the more conscientious I am about dieting, the more weight I gain. And then a friend told me to try just chilling and not watching every morsel I put in my mouth and I gained 5 more pounds. Aarrrghh! Just frustrating but it makes me feel so much better to know I am not alone",
