I've had it accessed with and without the spray its practically painless with the spray and stings a little without it. The nurse did miss it one time and that was super painful and sometimes it pinches a little when its first accessed. The ommaya access is painless believe it or not!",

When I get my treatments they pull fluid and test it. From what I understand its either positive or negative there is no # associated with the fluid. The spinal tap tech told me that my fluid was an \"off color\" not sure what he meant my that, and that fluid was negative. Its all very confusing!!!!",
