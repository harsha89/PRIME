    "Content": "Hi again. I hope everyone is having a wonderful Christmas and New Years. Just curious, One oncologist told me chemo for 4 months and one told me 5 months. So how do I know who is right. One is a cancer hospital only and one is not. Should that make a difference. I really don't want to go to a third. This is costing a fortune. Who do I listen to. I don't want 5 months but does that make me better longer? Tomorrow I find out about my gene testing...I pray it is negative so i can choose a second lumpectomy. I am sooooo confused about everything. Please help if you can with any ideas. Thanks! Michele",
