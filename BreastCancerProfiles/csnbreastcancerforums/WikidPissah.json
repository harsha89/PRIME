    "Content": "I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer on the day before Thanksgiving in 2010. On Jan 3, 2011 I had a bilateral mastectomy followed by chemo and radiation. In June of 2011 I had a double tram flap reconstruction. I can barely look at myself in the shower. My husband of 28 years hasn't seen them. They aren't even, and the nipples are weird. I haven't talked to anyone about this. I have been trying to just go on with my life, act normal. But I am not normal. My whole front side of my torso is still numb. My armpits are partially numb. I feel so fake and weird. i know I made the wrong decision with the tram. I was stupid, I thought I knew what to do. But I screwed up. I know that I shouldn't be complaining, at least I am alive. Please don't hate on me.",
