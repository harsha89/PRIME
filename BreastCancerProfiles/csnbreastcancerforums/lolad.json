Im not sure which one if not both caused my hair to fall out. The side effects for me are nausea, but i have nausea meds they give me before chemo and at home that help soooo much. But ive been very tired and want to sleep about days 3-5 or 6 and after my second treatment, i got very tired again for a couple of days right before it was time for my third treatment. I know side effects are different for everyone. Oh, and i also have blisters in my mouth that i got a mouth swish for, it just numbs my mouth for a few, but the blisters start to go down away and then its time for another chemo. So you might as well say that the rash in my mouth has been constant. Taste buds are gone too. I hope this post doesnt get you down too much. These are just what side effects i have on my treatment. Doesnt mean you will have the same. Take care of yourself laura",

I still pray every day for all of you who are still fighting or dancing with NED and also for those who have not made it and for their families. I am coming up on my three year diagnosis date in April and im still going through my reconstruction surgeries. I had to start going to another plastic surgeon because of the damage the first one did. I actually developed sepsus after one surgery and was in ICU for five days, but i finally can see the light at the end of this struggle. To the new ones on the board, welcome and know that you came to a very good board to share and get advice from everyone here. They are wonderful. To my old sisters still here, HELLO and its good to be back!!! God bless all",

Your man, oh goodness, chemo fog, Reggie! Thats it is such a wonderful kind soul as well. I can tell by your posts about him and i remember especially the beautiful post on a ceremony about it being at the beach and how spiritual and comforting it was to you. He shared that gift with you and has been so supportive. Im so happy you have him there with you. I am so sorry you are going through this. I am so sorry you have another battle ahead of you. Just about three weeks ago i found out i was dancing with NED. The same evening i spoke to a friend and her younger sister has been batteling bc for three years and it is now in her brain. I was so sad and thought to myself, how in the hell can i be celebrating me becoming a survivor when so many women are still batteling and some loosing? I told myself that i can still celebrate. I fought hard and won. But i can also make myself better by being there for others who are going through their fight. I know im babbling. Just know i love you and your kind soul. Im really shocked about it all. Fight as hard as you can. I know you will. You are a warrior. Please let me know how you are. Im praying hard and tell Reggie hes a wonderful man. Take care Laura",

They are keeping me for a couple of days. Maybe because now they have to borrow tissue from my back to replace the tissue on the left breast that i lost when it got infected. They also told me i would have a drain in my back and on both sides. Im glad it went so well. Did you have implants or what?",

I even asked my onc if it was necessary and he said very necessary. Now, this is just my story and how the tamoxifen effected me. It caused me problems almost immediately. They found that the tamoxifen was overexpressing my endrometrial lining and uterus and i developed three tumors. Two tumors were benign, but the tumor the found on my cervix was early stage cancer and my gyn onc said it was probably from taking the tamoxifen in MY CASE!! I had a total hysterectomy and now i dont have to worry about the cervical cancer thing. Just the hot flashes and night sweets and mood swings!!! They are going to be switching my hormone therapy to something else next week. In my case my estrogen was 100%pos and so was my progesterine. So, my onc told me i basically had to take it. Remember, not everyone responds this way to the med. This is just how it effected me. Take care Laura",

They did send me home with nausea meds, but one isnt covered by my insurance so im waiting for a prior authorization. Do you know what treatments you will be getting yet? I would definately ask about side affects on everyone and ask how long you have to do them. I know you wait and wait for all this to get rollling and once it does, it scares the heck out of you, but we have to do and we have to stay strong. Write down your questions before you go, that way you wont forget them when you get there. Good luck to you on monday. Ill be having a port put in that day since they had trouble with my veins on Tuesday. Im glad they've decided to go with it though. My poor arm has had it because they could only use the right one because my cancer and lymph nodes were on the left side. Take care and try to keep your head up. laura",

Was it your family dr or your onc. Your onc might be able to help you with something or vice verse. The thing with antidepressants is one, they take awhile to get into your system and they dont really help with anxiety attacks. Know that you are not alone with all this, its always on my mind it seems every minute of the day. Coming here and sharing with the board has helped me alot. Keep coming here for the advice and encouragements. Letting it out helps to let it go and makes it seem a little better for me. I dont think you can totally let it all go, but know that some day soon it will be better and we will be looking back and sighing that sigh of relief that it is behind us. Take care and just keep coming here. Also, it sounds like an outside support group might help you. Contact your local ACS and ask them for local groups you could attend. Take care and big hug to you. laura",
