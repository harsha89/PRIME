    "Content": "I had a double mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction June 25. I was in the hospital from Tuesday to Saturday.  Started with 8 drains, and came home with 5 drains. A kind woman from the breast cancer support group game me a homemade bag to hold all the drains--so helpful. 2 weeks+ post surgery I have no drains. I have necrotizing tissue on the right breast and on the belly incision. Cleaning and treating both sites with xeroform medicated gauze. Massaging the tissue to help break up the internal scar tissue. Still taking naps and not lifiting anything above 5 lbs. Happy with the amount of tissue my wonderful plastic surgeon was able to move up. ",
