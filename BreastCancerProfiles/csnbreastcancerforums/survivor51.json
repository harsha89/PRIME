      "Content": "Hey Rave, It is good to talk. I found something that helped right after my surgery that took both my \"girls\" was to take a hand towel and get it wet. Put it in the microwave for 1 minute and place on the area(s). Have your hubby put another one in the microwave and swap out a few times. It released the painl. Also, plenty of showers with hot water on the area. In the shower, I slowly moved my arm using my finger tips to climb the wall. That helped me with movement and I can move both arms freely now over my head and to fasten my bra. Now on to the emotional steps. Give yourself time TIME. Use us even at 2am. Vent, talk, cry, journal and share. You are definitely not alone. Feel free to click the email button below my message and email me. Take care.",

      "Content": "Hey, I'm so glad you are with us. There are two chats rooms: Chat Room #1 is for all cancers 24/7. When you go to it, you will not see your name but will see other names and it is rare that someone is not on chat. To chat, there is a rectangle at the bottom and you type and send. To \"private chat\" with someone individually, you click on their name and the two of you can chat and no one sees else sees it. In Chat Room #2, that is usually when \"groups\" meet, like I know Breast Chat is in Room #2 at 9EST. Other cancers meet at other times and there is a \"caregiver chat\" but I can't remember when. If you go on the board for that particular thing, it will tell you for \"caregivers\". If you keep hearing a \"ping\" sounds from the chats, turn your volume off or the \"ping\" each time someone enters will driver you crazy. Usually if you are a \"first timer\", someone will ask \"Are you a survivor or caregiver\". Some pple on chat are survivors, some caregivers, and some both. Then it will be what type cancer and usually when dx. Feel free to join into a conversation any time. Some people type fast and some slow. Sometimes it is jokes about the weathers, etc, but if you ever have a question, ask it and usually someone will know the answer. You will be talking with people from next door to Canada, to London, etc. Angela",

      "Content": "Hey Sweetie, I am so glad you came to our circle of wings. I lost my mother at the young age of 60 to cancer and my father at 70 of cancer. I knew what I might be facing and one day noticed my hair starting to come out after my first chemo. My sister literally massaged my head and all my shoulder length hair was gone within 30 minutes. What a shock, we cried, laughed and just hugged. When my husband came home, I had a scarf on and he walked up, gave me a big hug and said \"honey, here you are safe and no need for scarves.\" He took the scarf off and stepped back and said loudly with a laugh \"Finally I have more hair than you\" and yet your head still looks better\". We laughed and hugged and it does take time. As to you mom, that must have been heart wrenching and mine as well as all the sisters here send out our big hug, prayers, and angels your way. Angela",
