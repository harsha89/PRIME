      "Content": "Hi Julie, I just finished chemo in mid December (Taxotere and Cytoxan) and had 33 rounds of rads which I finished on February 29. I also had a bilateral mastectomy. I was Stage 2, grade 1 er, pr+ her2-, BRCA- , with 2 positive nodes. I was 44 at the time of the diagnosis. I had a low onco score (12) and my oncologist whom I have the utmost respect for recommended I do the chemo and radiation. My first husband passed away from cancer in July 2002 and when this diagnosis came for me I wanted to make sure I did everything I possibly could to stay alive for my kids-I wanted no regrets. My kids are 11. 16 and 14. I am also ready to start tamoxifen when I go meet with my oncologist tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to taking it, but I have had such bad hot flashes from the chemo I figure it can't be much worse!",

      "Content": "I gargled with salt water rise (I used about a tsp in 3/4 cup warm water) 3-4 times a day. I learned my lesson the first round and got a few mouth sores because I wasn't being religious with the 3-4 times a day. After that I never missed a beat. I truly believe that it helped keep me 100 % free from clods, sores throats, etc the entire time I was undergoing chemo. I asked my NP if I could continue the gargling even though I am done with chemo and she said no problem. I was always someone that had many colds and sore throats from September thru April and this has proven so beneficial!",

      "Content": "I have had what you describe every single time I have been put under. I am unable to read or see close-up for about 2 days, and my distance vision is messed up for about 2 weeks. When I went in to see my plastic surgeon I mentioned this to him, and he said that when you are under during surgery it causes a fluid shift in your body and that it can effect the lens of your eye. He told me that if it didn't improve in 2-3 weeks I should see my eye doctor. It was about 2 weeks and things finally went back to normal. I also have to use a scop patch behind my ear when I am put under to help with severe nausea and that does effect my vision too.",
