She was the first to reach out to me with a beautiful pink angel - and lots of love and hope. When I was away from work having my surgery, her husband, Nathan found out he had lymphoma - a large tumor found too close to his heart for surgery. During the summer of '09 we both had chemo at the same time - Sandra would sit with me and my hubby would sit with Nathan - sharing chocolate donuts and Subway sandwiches and dreams of what we would do when we recovered. Nathan went on to have a bone marrow transplant and was doing quite well when just after this past Thanksgiving the beast appeared once again. After fighting so very hard, he lost his battle on Valentines day. Please keep him and his wife, Sandra in your prayers - she's having a really hard time - he was 38 years old. Thank you -Jenny",

I'm so worried and upset - I'd been doing really well and a month ago or so I started gettin so aprehensive and depressed. Every ache and pain now I associate with that \"being something\" YIKES - I was doing so well and felt like I was on top of all this and now I'm a mess! My appt is tomorrow (Thurs 2-25) and as I had a uni-lateral mastectomy, what do they do for the surgical side? I have Kaiser and I'm sure I won't have a CAT or PET scan - maybe a chest x-ray? Anyone else out there who knows? ..anyway..please keep me in your prayers - I'm a basketcase! thanks so very much, -Jenny",
