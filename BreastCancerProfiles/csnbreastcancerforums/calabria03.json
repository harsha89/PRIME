    "Content": "Started Chemo on 4/1 cytoxan and taxotere this morning 4/17 my hair starting to come out not in clumps but in strands. My head has been hurting the last couple days not sure if its a headache or if its caused my hair getting ready to fall out. I didn't want to shave my head til I was sure it was coming out. Still scared to shave it. My girlfriend can come in the morning to do it if I want. I have an appt on Tuesday to have my head shaved and pick up my wig. Just wondering do I wait til Tuesday or will it start to come out in big clumps by the morning. Does losing your hair cause your head to hurt? If so does it stop hurting once you shave your head?",
