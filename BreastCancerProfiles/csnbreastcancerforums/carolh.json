    "Content": "I had a double TRAM flap March 2001. After a single mastectomy in September 1999 I decided to get the other breast removed and go for double reconstruction. I have no regrets and am very pleased with the results. It is major surgery and recovery takes several weeks but I think it was well worth it. Apart from rather nice, non sagging, new boobs, I also gained a tummy tuck. This gave me the impetus to lose some weight and I managed to lose nearly 50 lbs. Go for it! Best wishes, Carol (Vancouver, BC)",
