      "Content": "I am a breast cancer survivor, five years come December 31, 2005. I am using Tamoxifen and have been for almost 5 years. I have done chemo and radiation and I had 17 lymph nodes removed, so praise to God, I am alive!!!! My question to anyone out there is this: My new husband and I are considering getting pregnant this year, before I am off of the Tamoxifen, but the only alternative that we have is for me to stop taking the medication earlier than December. Has anyone found any cases of this and that it was successful? My husband is a minister and we believe strongly that this is in God's hands and that we are to have a baby this year, but I am only human and I get a little afraid when I think of getting off the medication early to have a child and I think we have miscarried twice already. Any suggestions or places I can find research would be helpful. Thanks",

Follow up, I had a miscarriage a year ago, but God has blessed my husband, daughter and I to be honored with the birth of another baby girl on May 19th of this year, yes a baby girl, 5 months old today and I am very happy and excited. On October 10th I had my gall bladder removed, but during my most recent mammogram, I am doing fine and living life. Someone talk to me, how's everyone? Love you guys.",
