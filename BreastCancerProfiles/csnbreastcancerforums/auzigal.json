    "Content": "I have one of each. Yes you do have to be in a clinical study for the silicone, but it is so worth it! The silicone one is so much softer and more natural than the saline. They both have risks as far as capsular contracture, but the new silicone implants actually have the same outer shell as the saline implants. they follow you close enough to prevent the issues that happened with the old silicone implants from the 70's. I love ther silicone, it is a lot more life-like. think about both and talk to your doc to make sure that either one is an option for you. Good Luck with all of this! :)",
