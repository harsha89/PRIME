      "Content": "When I meet with the rep in the Therapist office, she took body measurements in order to get the right size garments; height and weight as well. The garments have a lot of velcro, which is kinda of a pain at times, but allows for adjustment. The machine helped with the swelling in my torso and helped with shoulder movement. I didn't realize how much swelling I had in my shoulder and torso until I started using it. The glove and sleeve would push the fluid up into shoulder/torso and get stuck. Yes, keep your cell phone handy! Many times I would put on the garments, laid down and realized I had forgotten the phone or the remote. When I first started using it, I was still in Chemo and dealing with fog. Its good that your Therapist is getting training. Men can get lymphdema as well following any kind of surgery. When you refer to a \"night sleeve\" what do you mean? I just have a Juno compression sleeve, a glove (which I hate) and the compression type ace wrappings. My therapist told me not to sleep in the compression sleeve, but I do sometimes. Wrapping every night was difficult. My husband is out of town a lot with work, and I was trying to wrap with my non-dominant left hand. Sorry this is so long!",

      "Content": "and it works really well. The rep actually came to my house to train me how to use it. I learned about it from my lymphdema therapist. I meet a rep at her office and tried the machine, loved how it felt. The machine will be preset for pressure and time due to your situation. I use it daily for 60 minutes. Mine consist of the machine/pump, three brown qulited garments, and plastic hoses. The garments have lots of velcro, the rep will help fit the garments to your body. Its very relaxing. It has helped with the swelling and hardness. I still wear my sleeve, but rarly wear my glove. My lymphdema is severe and manual massage did not seem to be helping. Wrapping helped, but having it wrapped 24/7 was impratical and hot. Be sure to go to the bathroom before you start your session! You're like a kid in a snowsuit! I watch TV or a movie while I do mine.",
