Suddenly, a young blonde woman at the corner table stood on her chair and began shouting. \"I've heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes! What makes you think that you can stereotype women that way? What does the color of a person's hair have to do with her worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community, and from reaching our full potential as a person. Because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes, but women in general...and all in the name of humor!\" The embarrassed ventriloquist blushed, stammered and began to apologize, but the blonde cut him off - \"You stay out of this!

Surgery went well with clean margins, sentinal node removed, following up with 33 radiation treatments. 10 years ago, in the other breast, they were negative. The biopsy I had was not difficult or painful but waiting for the result was scary. Keep posting and I wish you well. Sue",

I do a few foot stretches before I get out of bed. Once I get going, it's not that bad. I did appreciate that I felt that I was still actively fighting.   Sue",

I'm not worried about bc returning (right now), just wonder about thyroid (rads), electolyes, depression. I have Effexor, but never started it. I just want to rule out other stuff. And what if I am depressed? Will Effexor get me moving?, Put some desire back in my life? And I mean desire as in if I'm hungry, have the desire to check out the fridge, make a meal... I'm almost 1 year out from clean mammo. I started work 2 days after rads (3.7.10), burned so raw, I wore telfa pads under my hubby's muscle undershirt, under my clothes for 2 weeks. Started Arimidex 6/1 and started caring for my parents weekends in mid August til 3 weeks ago. Maybe it just caught up with me. Now that I don't have to get up on weekends, I don't or can't. Anyone else??? Sue",
