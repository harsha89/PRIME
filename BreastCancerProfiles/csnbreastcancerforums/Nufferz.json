      "Content": "I want to thank everyone for the warm welcome and for making me feel very much at home here. Also thanks for the congratulatory notes on quitting smoking, it's been a tough row to hoe but has been so well worth it. I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to breathe clearly again and to actually discover that foods actually have flavors without seasonings! Who says quitters never win, eh? Heh! Now all I have to do is conquer the cancer and I plan on winning there too. Thanks again everyone. :) Nuff",

      "Content": "prv, I found a website that gives more information on drug interactions. Go to: http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/tamoxifen-index.html?filter=3&generic_only= I also have another website that I used, and it's a page you can print out. It gives the listing of the ones I posted above, and I printed it out, then I cut out the listing and put it in my wallet. So when I went to my nurse practitioner for and antidepressant, I had her look at it so she was aware of what NOT to prescribe for me. Go to: http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/COBRA/Tamoxifen%20and%202D6v7.pdf Hope this helps. Nuff",
