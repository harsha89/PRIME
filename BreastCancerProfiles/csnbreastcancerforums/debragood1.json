      "Content": "Although I did not have the same chemo regimen as I am having now (CMF: Cytoxan, Methotrexate, 5FU), I can give you some general tips. Sucking candy or gum during the infusion should eliminate any metallic taste during infusion (which is the only time I get that side effect). Also, hydrate well. Drink lots of water and if you have diarrhea or anything that might deplete your stores of nutrients, drink gatorade. (You can tell if you need Gatorade by the color of your urine. It should be amber. If it is nearly clear, you are drinking too much water and not enough gatorade or sports drink. As far as mouth sores, a very helpful nurse suggested I rinse my mouth with water after eating anything. This is very helpful so even though i get mouth sores, they go away quickly and don't get big or painful. Sleep as much as you can...sleep is healing. If you take steroids, ask your Onc. to give you a prescription for Ativan to help you sleep while you're on the steroids. Don't be afraid to contact your oncologist's nurse with any questions you have. Remember, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Also, oncology nurses are great and know a lot. Don't hesitate to call the nurse with any questions or comments or needs for meds. There is no need to suffer side effects if you don't have to. If you try a medication for a side effect and it doesn't work, call the nurse right away and ask for an alternative med. Don't worry about calling too much...that's what our health care providers are there for. Finally, give yourself a break. Pamper yourself whenever you can. Indulge. Be well! Good luck with the chemo. Chemo is not pleasant, but it can be done!",
