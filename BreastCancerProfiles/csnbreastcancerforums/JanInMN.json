It should all be in the computer, and if the system works, they should be able to get through it really fast with each patient. At the hospital where I work, they do have to go through registration and history items with each patient because if there are changes, and we don't ask, there could be legal problems and safety issues, but it should take minutes. Medical record...that's a whole other headache!!!! Good for you, for taking charge of keeping copies of all your records!",
