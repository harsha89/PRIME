    "Content": "I always took a book with me. I had the same cocktail and it was not so bad. I did not have a port - was able to take all treatments through the vein. Did not notice anything while doing the chemo. I did lose my hair and taste but other than than that was not to bad - maybe a little tired. I will be praying for you! You can get through this and you have alot of support right here. Good Luck!",
