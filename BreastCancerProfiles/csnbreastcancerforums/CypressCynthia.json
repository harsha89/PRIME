      "Content": "First, I just wanted to say that I am so very sorry that you are going through this. I know little about this type of cancer, but did find a couple of articles, which you may already have found (see below). \"Metaplastic breast cancer starts in the cells that support the breast tissue, rather than in the glandular breast tissue itself, and it behaves very differently. The treatment recommendations are based primarily on stage, because there haven't been any clinical trials specifically in women with metaplastic disease. Metaplastic disease is sometimes less sensitive to commonly used breast cancer therapies, but may be more sensitive to chemotherapies that are more commonly used for lung cancer or other cancers that have a similar squamous cell appearance. Unfortunately with more rare tumors, it's always difficult to do focused studies to be able to provide patients with clear information to guide their decisions.\"http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/ask_expert/12_2009/q24 \"What Are the Treatments for Metaplastic Squamous Cell Breast Cancer? Print Sep 2, 2010 | By Louise Tremblay Louise Tremblay recently finished an M.Sc. in molecular and cellular biology in Ontario, Canada, with years of cancer research experience. She has experience writing articles and Web content on science, heath and fitness, diet and personal wellness. Metaplastic squamous cell breast cancer is an exceedingly rare form of the disease, accounting for less than 0.1 percent of breast cancer cases, according to a study published in the journal Onkologie in 2007. Cells in a metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast have a flattened squamous shape, which is used to help diagnose the disease. This form of cancer is generally aggressive and often fails to respond to hormone-based therapies, but it may respond to other cancer treatments. Mastectomy The primary treatment for metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is a mastectomy, a breast-removing surgery. Since metaplastic squamous cancer cells are typically invasive and aggressive, surgeons often perform aggressive surgeries to fight the cancer. During a mastectomy, the surgeons excise the metaplastic squamous tumor along with any remaining breast tissue, the breast skin and nipple, and layers of chest muscle underneath the cancerous breast. The doctors also remove a series of small structures called lymph nodes, since invasive breast cancers often invade lymph nodes around the breast. Following surgery, patients with metastatic squamous cell breast cancer may receive additional cancer treatments. Adjuvant Chemotherapy Many breast cancer patients with metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma receive adjuvant chemotherapy--drug therapy designed to kill cancer cells and shrink breast tumors. Chemotherapy drugs are designed to inhibit normal processes in the cell as well as damage essential cellular structures, essentially damaging the cancer cell and preventing it from making the chemicals it needs to survive. Patients with metaplastic squamous cell breast cancer may receive a number of chemotherapy treatments, either alone or in combination, depending on the aggressiveness and characteristics of the tumor. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy can lead to a number of side effects, such as nausea, fatigue and hair loss, though these effects subside after cessation of treatment. Targeted Therapy Some patients with metaplastic squamous cell breast cancer may receive targeted therapies--drugs that identify and kill cancer cells by targeting proteins found on the cells' surface. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2005 indicates that many patients with metaplastic squamous cell breast cancer have tumors containing a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR. Under normal conditions, EGFR aids in cell growth by promoting cell division. Some metaplastic squamous cell breast cancers begin to overproduce the EGFR protein, causing constant cell proliferation and driving cancer growth. Drugs that target EGFR, such as ZD1839, can therefore target and kill metaplastic squamous cell cancers in some cases. Patients looking to receive targeted therapies must first undergo medical testing to assess whether their cancer will likely respond to specific drugs.

I was just 33 at the time. Years after the first mastectomy, I had a second preventive one because 2 of 3 sisters had subsequently also been diagnosed. I would have reconstruction again as I just feel better in a swimsuit, etc. I had the surgeries using my own tissue rather than the implants as my younger sister had so many problems with her implants that I figured I would too. My younger sis and I were tested for BRCA and were negative. My doc says this is not uncommon as they have not yet to identify every gene that is involved in heriditary type of cancers. It is not uncommon for those of us who have a strong family hx to test negative for BRCA. My doc is sure that ours is inherited (generations riddled with breast and colon cancer), but we may never know the gene involved.",

Re marijuana: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/254454.php The gold standard for pain remains opioids.  They do indeed have side effects.  The most common are nausea, fatigue and constipation.  Taking them with meals can help with nausea, but I battle nausea with nearly everything.  The chart below describes the relative strengths of different opioids.  Oral morphine is the reference drug and ascribed a \"1\" rating.  Every other opioid is then compared to it.  For example, IV morphine is assigned a \"3\" because it is 3 X stronger than oral morphine and fentanyl is assigned a \"50-100\" (depending on dose) because it is 50-100 X stronger than oral morphine.  I hope this makes sense and helps.  If not, feel free to pm me. See chart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic Part of why I have made it so long (nearly 27 years, 8 with Stage 4), I believe, is that I try and puzzle out what will work for my side effects.  I do not stop therapy if at all possible, because I am very, very stubborn about fighting cancer.  For me, cancer is the enemy, not the treatment.  This is not always easy.  And what works for me may do nothing for you.  We are all so biologically and chemically unique.  ",

If I can skip a PET/CT (I am aware of the radiation dosage) I do, but the last one I had before this year was 2010 and I can't help but wonder, if I had had another in 2011 or 2012, would it have shown mets earlier? Good fortune and a strict adherence to treatment has kept me alive this long.  Don't ever forget who the enemy really is (CANCER).",

The pain was not continual. if you are having terrible pain all day long, please call your physician, but, if your pain is very slowly getting better, it may be normal. Mostly, for me, the pain was bad at night or when I was very active. I do remember taking a pain med in the evening for quite awhile, but mostly able to get by with advil during the day. Pain 101 (this is from nursing school); As Linda pointed out, you heal faster if you move more. Take your pain med (prescription or advil or tylenol), wait about 15-20 min and then get up and take a walk (not a marathon though). Pain meds work best on mild to moderate pain, so do not wait until your pain is severe to take something. If you do, it is very hard to manage your pain and you will end up taking more meds with a less effective result. You have to anticipate pain too. For example, if you know you are going to do an activity that may cause pain, take something ahead of time. Pain is worse at night (probably related to prostaglandin levels). Pain meds are prescribed not just to make you comfortable; they are prescribed because they make you more active and acivity=healing faster. Contact Reach to Recovery (with you surgeon's ok, of course). They will send out a trained person who teaches you very mild but effective exercises (such as climbing your fingers up a wall) that promote healing and do help with pain. They helped me sooo much! If you call your local ACS, they can put you in contact with a volunteer. http://www.cancer.org/treatment/supportprogramsservices/reach-to-recovery I believe that, with your described history, you will need folow up and your oncologist can do this. Some surgeons will follow you for awhile, but your oncologist would be the one to order scans and tests to monitor your progress.",

      "Content": "If the coating persists, I would see an ENT or dermatologist. This could be an infection--either bacterial, fungal or viral and you will need a swab to determine exactly what it is. Chemo can cause dry mouth which makes your tongue more susceptible to infection. Here are some suggestions for combatting this (from http://www.chemocare.com/managing/dry_mouth.asp): \"Keep mouth and lips moist: \u2022Rinse mouth with water frequently (every 2 hrs while awake & when awake during the night). May add salt or baking soda (1/2 to 1 teaspoon in 8 ounces of water). \u2022Use saliva substitute (commercially available). \u2022Biotene® products can be purchased without a prescription. Products available for treating dry mouth are; mouthwash, toothpaste, as well as, chewing gum that has the pH of saliva. \u2022Oralbalance® moisturizing gel can be applied to the mouth or tongue and acts as a moisturizing coat. \u2022Apply lip moisturizer often (i.e. Chapstick®). \u2022Suck on tart hard candies (lemon drops, Jolly Ranchers®). Watch sugar content with candy - can produce cavities. \u2022Use cool mist room humidifier at night in the bedroom. A humidifier on the furnace doesn't provide enough humidity for treating dry mouth. Keep mouth & teeth clean \u2022Use soft-bristle toothbrush (can soften even more by placing brush in very warm water), cotton swabs, mouth swabs (popsicle stick covered with gauze) to clean teeth after each meal and at bedtime. (3 or more times a day). \u2022Clean dentures and/or bridge after eating. Leave out dentures if experiencing any discomfort caused by xerostomia. \u2022Floss gently with unwaxed floss (if platelet count not too low). \u2022May use Water-Pik® \u2022Avoid mouthwashes with alcohol base. Use non-alcohol based mouthwashes. \u2022Avoid lemon glycerin swabs - contribute to dryness. Increase fluids: \u2022Drink plenty of liquids at least 8-12 glasses of fluid a day, unless advised not to by your doctor. This helps to thin and loosen mucous. \u2022Carry a water bottle with you and sip frequently during the day to help alleviate dry mouth. \u2022Limit coffee, tea and alcohol. These contribute to dry mouth. Caffeine products as coffee, tea and colas act as diuretics. \u2022Try Ovaltine® and Postum® drinks - each has calories and vitamins - as a substitute for tea and coffee. Diet: \u2022Eat a soft, high protein moist diet. \u2022Substitute moist fish, eggs, cheese for red meat. \u2022Serve food lukewarm, hot food can burn mouth. \u2022Avoid dry foods (bread, dry meat, pastries, toast and crackers, snack foods that are dry and salty). \u2022Soak bread and or rolls in milk or sauces. \u2022Eat moistened casseroles and meats with gravies, sauces, soups, stews. \u2022Use sour cream, and half & half cream as sauce bases (adds calories). \u2022Avoid citric foods, juices such as tomato, orange, grapefruit based products and sauces. \u2022Blenderize food and drink. \u2022Yogurt, fresh fruit, powdered milk \u2022Fruit slushies \u2022Milk shakes with or without fresh fruit. \u2022Avoid sodas that are fizzy. May try letting the soda go flat and then drink. \u2022Milk is high in protein but may produce thick saliva. If this is true for you try soy or rice milk. If dry mouth is due to infection, medications for treating the infection may be prescribed such as: \u2022Antifungals: nystatin,clotrimizole, fluconozole \u2022Antibacterials: Mouthwash antiseptic, rinses are the basis of the oral decontamination regimen. \u2022Antivirals: acyclovir (Zovirax®) or famciclovir (Famvir®) When to call your doctor or healthcare professional: \u2022Temperature greater than 100.5 F (38 C). \u2022Nausea (interferes with ability to eat and unrelieved with prescribed medication). \u2022Vomiting (vomiting more than 4-5 times in a 24 hour period). \u2022Diarrhea (4-6 episodes in a 24-hour period). \u2022Unable to eat or drink for 24 hours or have signs of dehydration: tiredness, thirst, dry mouth, dark and decrease amount of urine, or dizziness. \u2022Pain or any sign of infection (such as heavily coated tongue).\"",

But I am confused about a stent? Do you mean an IV or a nasogastric tube? I would want an IV as IV pain meds can really help with pain. Food and IV fluids do not usually help with end-of-life care. In fact, they often make a patient much less comfortable. IV fluids can go straight to the patient's lungs and cause difficulty breathing (pulmonary edema). Appetite disappears near the end of life and nutrition can cause nausea and vomiting. Ice chips, lemon swabs for dry lips, etc may be more humane options. Here is an excellent link for families: Comfort Care http://continuumcarehospice.com/documents/Hospice%20Care%20Pamphlet.pdf When my husband's grandmother was dying, the doctors did \"everything\" and the result was disastrous. She ended up with a surgical wound and infection that never healed (won't go into it but truly gruesome); every breath was a rattle and gasp, etc. Her daughter, my husband's aunt, researched end-of-life care and, when she was dying years later from cancer, she died a truly beautiful death. She worked closely with hospice to let them know what she wanted and they titrated her meds in her own home to keep her comfortable. We visited her the day before she died and it was an amazing experience. The moral of the story for me is to be prepared, make your wishes known, put them in writing, and, if possible, die in the comfort of your own home. P.S. I have Stage 4 cancer, so you can tell I have thought about this a lot. I have a \"Five Wishes\" form which carefully describes what I want. My hospital gave me the form, but they can also be ordered on line: http://www.agingwithdignity.org/catalog/",

In 1987, faced with Stage 3A and, back then, a grim prognosis, I made the decision, after finding an oncologist who is brilliant (but a little House-like), to trust my onc and fight with everything that I had. He had trained extensively and I was just learning about my diagnosis. Many of his decisions were controversial at the time. He recommended tamoxifen for a premenopausal woman--not normally done back in 1987. I didn't argue, I did it. Now, here I am 24 years later and his expertise and my fighting spirit got me this far. And, even though I had a setback in 2009 (bone mets after a remission of 22 years), I am still functional and fighting. My recommendation, fight the beast with all that you've got!",

Although I also had chemo, rads and a mastectomy in 1987, I think the tamoxifen is what has kept me going as my tumor is ER+ and tamoxifen was the \"new\" addition to my treatment at the time. Honestly though, I wasn't crazy about some of the side effects--maily being a little tired and having no sex drive at such a young age. But I'll take life any day!",

An umbrella will not be enough.  It is not just direct sunlight for me.  It appears to be indirect as well.  Use an excellent sunblock (minimum SPF 30) and cover up as much as you can.  Be careful and have an exit plan if you start to burn or begin to feel sick.  As far as the pool is concerned, it will depend on who is maintaining the pool.  Our daughter caught an eye infection from a public pool once.  I remember saying how nice it was that the pool had no chlorine smell...Lol.  Maybe not such a good thing to have less chlorine.  There are chlorine free pools that are safe too.  But you might ask pool manager how often and when pool is serviced just to be safe!

I have had my port for 9 months now.  Recently while getting chemo, I asked my oncology nurse how long could it last.  She introduced me to a lady next to me with sickle cell anemia who has had a port for 15 years!  I love my port and I hope it lasts forever.  I wish I had had one with my first round of chemo because now my existing veins are so damaged and IV options are very limited (especially since they can't use my left arm). As far as flushing, I will have chemo every 21 days indefinitely, so I don't have to worry about it.  If I had to get it flushed, I would ask my oncology nurses if I could just run over and have them do it.  If you are far from an infusion center that might not be an option. One final word about my port, I no longer let anyone touch it except my oncology nurses (if I can help it).  I had a bad experience in the ER when an ER nurse did not use the central line kit and accessed it like an IV (you are supposed to wear mask, sterile gloves, etc.).  Fortunately, I was in the ER with febrile neutropenia and was started on IV antibiotics.  That experience shook me up though because I have seen central line infections.  And, yes, I should have spoken up, but when you are shaking with chills and fever, you aren't thinking straight. In spite of that, I strongly recommend a port.  Chemo can do permanent damage to veins and it is much better to have chemo infusing into a very large blood vessel where it is quickly diluted and much less likely to cause vascular damage.",

For years, if I had a minor or major surgery, they would start with using my one beat up vein (if they could) or stick me repeatedly to find something.  Then, I would wake up with a jugular (neck) IV that anesthesia would place.  Not a great place for an IV. I was on zometa (after metastases) without a port and it was traumatic for both me and the nurses.  I asked my onc to switch to xgeva because it is a shot and not an infusion. For me, the port has been a lifesaver.  Everyone is so individual but I remember my oncologist saying I didn't really need a port with my first chemo.  If I had had a crystal ball, I would have insisted - especially having just the one arm to use.  You never know how your veins are going to hold up until you've lived with the diagnosis for decades and you never know what the future holds in terms of surgeries and, God forgive, a repeat of the cancer. ",

PS Your port may still be irritated because you haven't had it very long.  If you have serious pain (especially if you have a fever or any redness), I would let your surgeon know.  ",

Because of it, Danny and I are trying to eat/drink more foods that lower inflammation. This research is showing that cells that are inflamed release substances that fuel our cancer, so cancer actually causes MORE inflammation and aging. This was a new concept to me, but it makes sense. Often I have a lot of inflammation, pain, arthritis, etc. that may actually be driven by my cancer. Bet it makes sense to many of you too. To recap, inflammation may cause cancer and cancer causes inflammation. Hopefully, researchers, now being aware, can figure out some powerful anti-oxidant therapies to help us out.

Our goal was to provide current estimates of alcohol-attributable cancer mortality and years of potential life lost (YPLL) in the United States. Methods. We used 2 methods to calculate population-attributable fractions. We based relative risks on meta-analyses published since 2000, and adult alcohol consumption on data from the 2009 Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System, 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and 2009\u20132010 National Alcohol Survey. Results. Alcohol consumption resulted in an estimated 18\u2009200 to 21\u2009300 cancer deaths, or 3.2% to 3.7% of all US cancer deaths. The majority of alcohol-attributable female cancer deaths were from breast cancer (56% to 66%), whereas upper airway and esophageal cancer deaths were more common among men (53% to 71%). Alcohol-attributable cancers resulted in 17.0 to 19.1 YPLL for each death. Daily consumption of up to 20 grams of alcohol (≤\u20091.5 drinks) accounted for 26% to 35% of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths. Conclusions. Alcohol remains a major contributor to cancer mortality and YPLL. Higher consumption increases risk but there is no safe threshold for alcohol and cancer risk. Reducing alcohol consumption is an important and underemphasized cancer prevention strategy. (Am J Public Health.

Tamoxifen fits into a receptor site on your breast estrogen that cancer must use in order to feed on the estrogen. Thus the cancer may literally starve because it can not access your estrogen. Tamoxifen has side effects that can be estrogen enhancing (such as bone strengthening) or estrogen lowering (such as hot flashes). It is a very powerful tool in fighting ER+ tumors.

Many of us have abnormally low levels and I am not sure why. Don't try adding more d supplements before checking your level. It is important to take the right amount for you. Any of your docs will order this simple blood test. Also, if you continue with the pain, ask for a referral to a rheumatologist. We are also at higher risk for autoimmune issues, so you might want to check this out. A good rheumatologist can help you to sort this out. All of us tend to blame everything on our meds and/or cancer, but the truth is that other events may be occurring that need to be checked out: arthritis, aging, etc. Last but not least, ask for a referral to a Physical Therapist as they can often start you on some gentle joint-lubricating exercises that may help you build up your stamina and get you on the right track. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Time for a frank talk with your oncologist.  Tell him/her what you have told us and see if there are any other ideas to help with the nausea.  I am afraid I may be joining you with this problem as nausea is always a problem for me.  Last time that I ran into this problem, it was actually my oncologist's nurse who came up with the combo that worked for me.  Keep asking!  And you are the strongest person that I know.  Sending big hugs and prayers. \"How do doctors prevent nausea and vomiting? Most people undergoing chemotherapy receive anti-nausea (anti-emetic) medications to prevent nausea and vomiting. These drugs, given alone or in combination, can be taken in pill form or administered through a vein in your arm. Your doctor advises which to use based on the treatment you're receiving. Anti-nausea medications are typically given before treatment begins and on a scheduled basis for several hours or days after treatment. You may receive additional medications if you develop nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy. Your doctor determines which anti-nausea medications to use based on your specific situation, for example, what type of chemotherapy drugs you're receiving. Drugs used to prevent nausea and vomiting include: Aprepitant (Emend) Dexamethasone Dolasetron (Anzemet) Dronabinol (Marinol) Droperidol (Insapsine) Granisetron (Kytril) Haloperidol (Haldol) Methylprednisolone (Medrol) Metoclopramide (Reglan) Nabilone (Cesamet) Ondansetron (Zofran) Palonosetron (Aloxi) Prochlorperazine (Procomp) Drugs used to treat anxiety associated with chemotherapy nausea include: Alprazolam (Niravam, Xanax) Lorazepam (Ativan) Midazolam Doctors take this proactive approach to prevent nausea and vomiting because these side effects can be difficult to control once they begin. Nausea and vomiting can make you feel miserable, add to your fatigue and distress, and make you reluctant to stick to your treatment schedule. If you're unsure about taking anti-nausea medication when you aren't feeling nauseated, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of these drugs. What additional measures can you take to prevent nausea and vomiting? You can take steps to reduce your risk of nausea and vomiting. For example: Eat small meals. Stagger small meals throughout the day rather than eating fewer, larger meals. If possible, don't skip meals. Eating a light meal a few hours before treatment also may help. Eat what appeals to you. It's best, however, to avoid foods that are sweet, fried or fatty. In addition, cool foods may give off less bothersome odors. Cook and freeze meals in advance of treatment to avoid cooking when you're not feeling well. Or have someone else cook for you. Drink lots of fluids. Try cool beverages such as water, unsweetened fruit juices, tea or ginger ale that's lost its carbonation. It may help to drink small amounts throughout the day, rather than larger amounts less frequently. Avoid unpleasant smells. Pay attention to what smells trigger nausea for you. For some, a specific smell, such as the smell of something frying or a greasy smell, may cause nausea. Other people may experience nausea when smelling any strong odor. Limit exposure to unpleasant smells. Fresh air may help. Make yourself comfortable. Rest after eating, but don't lie flat for a couple of hours. Try wearing loosefitting clothing and distracting yourself with other activities. Use relaxation techniques. Examples include meditation and deep breathing. These self-care measures may help you prevent nausea and vomiting, but they can't take the place of anti-nausea medications. If you begin to feel nauseated despite the medications, call your doctor. Treatments may include additional medications, though your individual treatment will depend on what's causing your signs and symptoms.\" http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cancer/CA00030/NSECTIONGROUP=2",

You are in a difficult position because I imagine you already have significant joint pain?  My advice is to take it and see and don't give up.  I had a sister who couldn't tolerate one of the aromatase inhibitors (that is what arimidex is) and she switched to aromasin.  She never had the joint pain.  My younger sister has had minimal se from femara (mild joint pain). I had mild joint pain on arimdex and would still be on it, but I am Stage 4 and it quit working after awhile.  SE are scarier, but cancer is scarier and very sneaky.  I am an old-timer who was originally diagnosed with Stage 3 in 1987!  I had a long remission and then have been Stage 4 since 2005 (bone, lung and liver mets).  I am currently back in remission, but I do not know how long before the cancer shows up somewhere else. My philosophy has been to take the cancer fighting meds and then deal with the side effects with exercise, eating right, other meds - whatever it takes to get through it.  Sometimes I feel like, if there is a reason why I am still alive after 27 years with this wretched disease, it is to encourage others to just do it!!!  and stick with it!!!  Big, big (((hugs))).  ",

These benefits have been seen in women with ER and/or PR positive tumors \u2013 even weakly positive, but have not been seen in ER and PR negative tumors, therefore current recommendations are for women with ER or PR positive tumors to take Tamoxifen or another aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) for five years.

We named him Fluffy and bought the iguana book at the same time we got him. Big mistake, HUGE! Iguanas are not easy to care for. They are prone to metabolic bone disease and need a very specialized diet, basking lights with UVA/UVB rays, continuous warm temperature and a certain amount of sunshine every day. Katherine was over him in about a week. Of course, I fell in love with him and he loved me. He followed me everywhere. Every day, I would take him out to our deck and he would sun himself and then dive in our fish pond and poop. He would never ever poop anywhere except in water (a real problem in the winter). That is also another common iguana quirk. We could leave him in the back yard as he would just do the above routine and then scratch on the back door when he was done. He really never wanted to be anywhere except with me. As Fluffy grew and grew, Danny, the engineer, built larger and larger plexiglass cages that had multiple lamps. They were bigger than a refrigerator (but horizontally placed). One day when I was getting him out of his cage, so that he could get his daily sun soak, I wasn't paying attention and didn't notice his claws were curled around a very large basking rock. I pulled out the lizard and the rock went Bam on my foot. Ouch! Fluffy didn't mean it as an iguana's claws are curled like that so that they can climb trees well. He was a lot of work, but I did truly love him. However, I would never buy one again and I don't recommend iguanas as pets. Way too much maintenance! And, because I know you will ask...Fluffy died at age 12 of a tail infection. In the wild, an iguana usually loses his original tail to predators. The new shortened tail is actually healthier. An iguana with its original tail is at high risk for infection as the very long tail has very poor circulation. When he first showed signs of an infection, I took him to the vet immediately. The vet was in over his head. I recommended amputating the tail and he looked at me like I had 2 heads. He tried to treat him conservatively, but the infection kept returning. He finally called some iguana expert in California who told him to do an Xray and see if the infection had spread to his pelvic bones. Of course, it had, and the expert said that he recommended euthanasia. Very sad. He was the sweetest pet and very smart. TMI, I know but you asked...lol!",
