    "Content": "My onc. says that the Herceptin is like water (no side effects). He further says that all of the hair thinning, joint and muscle aches and pains, and so forth, are due to the Docetaxel (taxotere)and the Carboplatin (paraplatin). I finish the D&C end of August and go on the Herceptin alone for an additional six months. I was planning on all of my adverse symptoms disappearing once I got on the herceptin alone. Am I naive on this one?",
