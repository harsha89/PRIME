The prayers and support from my church helped me get thru my treatment. After your treatment you will be able to give a great testimony to your \"sisters\". Seize that opportunity to tell them about the early detection of breast cancer. In His Care, Margaret",

      "Content": "Hi Becky, This site allows you to search for others who have gone thru your similar treatment regimens. For instance, you could input your age and whether you are in treatment, post treatment or recurrence. It will then search thru the registered breast cancer survivors and give you a list of women with similar experiences. You can also click on the \"Author\" of any post and read their personal website if they have prepared one. I am almost 3 years out from my original surgery (lumpectomy, then chemo) and am doing fine though I still have followups every four months. After August I will \"graduate\" to 6 months!! Welcome to this site, you will find it very supportive. Margaret",
