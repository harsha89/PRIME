      "Content": "You can find some beautiful batik fabrics made out of rayon at larger fabric stores and some at places like Joanns. Quilt stores will have an even better selection, but they can be more expensive. I like Batik because it's patterned on both sides. I've made all my scarves (it's all ever wear) and the rayon ones are the softest and the warmest. (its's starting to get really cold where I am - 32 degress this morning.) Batik can sometimes look like tye dye so you might find the kind of patterns you want. I also just buy a little over a yard and sew the edges up. That makes them a 36\" square that is just the right size. I also ordered a little cap from the ACS catalog that can go under scarves to make your head not look so flat. I think it helps.",

      "Content": "I had some tingling and numbness after the first treatement and my oncologist and nutritionist both recommened taking vitamin B6. It didn't stop the numbness, but it didn't get any worse after that - which apparently it can. The neuropathy side effect builds up with each treatment so this seemed like a good thing. The other thing they mentioned is glutamine, which comes in a powder that you mix with water or some beverage. The nutritionist told me that the limited testing she has seen with glutamine says that it only works on about half the people. I tried it hoping I was in the good half - no such luck. It's also pretty expensive. Make sure you drink TONS of water before, during and after the treatment. The solution they use to infuse Taxol is different than most chemo and you really want to keep it moving through your system. For the immediate problem - I did find that massage was helpful for my fingers and especially for my feet. It seemed to reduce the amount of numbness to a tolerable level. My oncologist's nurse recommended massaging your fingers during the treatments to keep the drugs from settling in your finger tips. I tried that but they took such a long time to give me the treatment that I couldn't possibly do that the entire time. Good luck with the rest of your chemo. Hang in there!",

      "Content": "I also did 4 treatments of AC and now Taxol (I've had 2/4 treatments of that) and my eyes were super dry with the AC. I also found sunlight hard to take. Sometimes I would wake up and feel like my eyes were glued shut and had sand in them. AC made my skin and my nose and my eyes all really dry all the time. I used artificial tears several times a day to help keep my eyes from hurting so much. I will say that since starting on Taxol this has eased up quite a bit. I still get a bit of dry eye but nothing like it was. Hopefully getting through the AC (congratulations, by the way - that's a big accomplishment!) will help give you some relief.",

      "Content": "They aren't the most tactful bunch. Were you thinking of implants or a flap procedure? I was overweight at diagnoisis, lost 40 pounds during chemo and radiation (taste and smell issues) and I'm definately still overweight. In fact, my oncologist wants me to continue to lose weight and be on a big exercise routine. I saw a plastic surgeon last week at the suggestion of my breast surgeon to find out about my options. I met with the plastic surgeon, his resident and an intern who explained my options. For me it was implants or a diep flap procedure. They didn't recommend implants because I had radiation and showed me some pictures of how that might turn out. My weight wasn't a problem for implants though. Apparenly my weight was an issue for the deip flap. They explained the surgery and told me I had the perfect body for it because I had good stomach fat. (Oh yea - just what I always wanted to hear!) The plastic surgeon explained that you can't be too thin or too fat to have a deip flap procedure. Then they all stood there and discussed how my fat was just right. It was so embarrasing. I asked about my oncologists instructions to lose weight and he told me that I shouldn't lose more than 10 pounds or I would be underweight. Seriously - I haven't been underweight since I was 7 years old. This has to be the first time in my life that a medical person told me that having fat was a good thing. It makes me wonder if they all have their own version of what they think is right. What about getting a second opinion? I've heard some really good and bad stories about plastic surgeons. Hopefully you could find someone who appreciates how hard you are working to be healthy and not be so rude!",

      "Content": "I work in an elementary school, mainly with 1st to 4th grades. My principal told me to handle it however I felt was best and that became answering whatever question they asked - at their level. I had surgery just before the end of school last year and when I came back I answered honestly. The younger ones wanted to know if I was sick, the older ones were too smart to believe that you miss school for a couple weeks for and asked about operations,etc. When school started this fall I had been through most of my chemo and I wear scarves everyday. (I never could get used to a wig.) I had many students ask questions. Some know I had a sickness that required really harsh medicine and my hair fell out. They ask me all the time how much has grown back and if they can see it. Older students have had family members with cancer and they recognize the look. I've had several (4th & 5th graders) ask me if I have cancer and I tell them I do. It opens up an opportunity to show them that sickness can be overcome and that sometimes you just have to deal with the cards you get and make the best of things. It give them an opportunity to tell you about their family member who has cancer and I have had some amazing conversations. I think high school students will notice and are old enough to understand. Many will have shared experiences from family members and they can probably be a big support for you. During my treatment my teenage daughter has had a teacher at her school in treatment at the same time. Her teacher was very honest with all her students and had three different wigs she wore that were very different looks (one was even green - one of the school colors!) I think high school students love to be supportive in situation where they see they can help. My daughers school sounded a lot like Kathy DDD's school. They wore bracelets and t-shirts and had a celebration when she finished chemo. The janitor (a women with very long hair) even allowed the students to donate money to cut off a lock of her hair (which went to locks of love) and then she shaved her head! If you're up for it, they'll want to help you all the way! I hope it all goes well for you. You're in my prayers.",

      "Content": "I lost my sense of taste with chemo(4xAC/4xTaxol.) I had 4 weeks between chemo and rads and it didn't comeback during that time. About 2/3 weeks into rads my sense of smell started to be affected and by the time I was finished my sense of smell was completely altered. I smell things differently that thay should smell or not at all. My sense of taste is also still gone and the smell issues only make that worse. I asked my rads oncologist at the time and he said what everyone says - your sense of smell and taste shouldn't be affected by rads unless it's to your neck and head. He blamed chemo. My medical oncologist blamed the rads. She said it was probably the rads since there was a small part my radiation that did hit the very bottom of my neck (it had to because of the angle they had to use to hit my chest.) I finished rads last December and my taste and smell are still not right. My taste has returned a little bit - many, many things still don't taste right or don't taste at all. My sense of smell has also changed over time, with some things still smelling weird and other things not smelling at all. Although lately I've had some things smell normal for a short time and then go back to smelling stange. My oncologist had an MRI taken of my head to see if there was some problem with my olofactory nerves, but it was clear. She also thinks it might be some type of nerve damage from Taxol, since I did have serious reactions to the drug and neuropathy in my feet and hands, which is a form of nerve damage. The next step is an Ear Nose and Throat specialist to see if they can figure it out. I'll keep good thoughts for you. If your rads oncologist says anything useful, let me know. I'd love to be finished with this side effect!",
