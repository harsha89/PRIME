    "Content": "I am also new to the chat room. I have a 4 1/2 year old daughter and an 8 1/2 year old son. I was diagnosed with DCIS on my right breast 12/23/02, had bilateral mastectomies on 2/13/03, and also was diagnosed with ovarian cancer on 6/29/02. Mostly males were born in my family. Only member of my family that had cancer was my grandfather who died of prostate ca with brain mets. No history on my maternal side. On 1/16/03 (before my surgery) I had the BRCA1/BRCA 2 testing done through Myriad Genetic Testing Lab. I have Blue Care Network (a Blue Cross insurance product)and they denied all coverage for this test with the main reasons that it was a service out of their network and that I did not have enough first and second degree relatives to prove that I should have this test done. I am also a registered nurse that works in a case management department in a hospital. To date, I have had no contact with Myriad re my test results. As someone else pointed out, the test is expensive - about $2,700. I do not have the finances to put out that amount of money for the test. Wish I did. I'm really concerned re for my children's sake re inherited disease and am desperately trying to find a way to get the test results that are delayed secondary to payment for this test. Unfortunately, from what I've learned Myriad has a monopoly on being the only provider that can perform this test in the US. A genetic nurse that I met with before the test mentioned a Canadian company that may be starting to do similar testing but did not know the name of the company. I hope any of this information that I'm passing on to you is helpful. Good luck and please share info if you come across any.",
