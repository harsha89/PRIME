    "Content": "  I had good luck with reversal of loss of sensation in my right foot to my calf, with acupuncture. I didn't even realize I had no feeling in my calf until I had the needles inserted and felt nothing. After  I could feel my feet it felt like I was walking with hockey pucks in my shoes. I bought the ReBuilder  from a chiropractor online for $250. I used the water bath method, used Epsom salts to make the water more conductive and used it 2x/day for months. Then gradually decreased how often to not using it 3 yrs later. I still have some numbness but don't think of my feet with each step. If it really bothers me I get out the ReBuilder again. You have be compliant to make it work and it is a pain in the neck lugging water but it helped so much. A chiropractor nearby uses the Rebuilder, maybe you could try it there to see if it helps you. My onco group is looking into the Metanx med per my request. It is a new drug for diabetic neuropathy that some have had good luck with. Also read about cold lazer helping. Hope you find something that helps. jojo2",
