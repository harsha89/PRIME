    "Content": "Hey guys! I'm writing from sunny (or in this case rainy) FL. My sister had her first TC treatment today! I've got her on plenty of fluids and I must say she's doing very well. She goes in on Friday morning for her Neulasta shot and we're stocked up on the extra strength Tylenol just incase :) I again wanted to thank everyone for their support and well wishes. Hope everyones day is going great! God Bless you all",
