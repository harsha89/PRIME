The most important is having a correct size, You can be measured in the store, or but better by lymphedema therapist. If you want to be covered by insurance you need to call them and ask to recommend store which is in-network and taking your insurance. You also need to see lymphedema therapist to measure your arm to determine your size. Ask you surgical /breast oncologist to recommend a specialist.

You also should seek a second opinion - from another plastic surgeon. Primary care physician - blood metabolic panel, consultation with Gastroenterologist and gynecologist will be helpful as well. I had my Tram flap 14 months ago. Generally speaking I am doing ok. However every time when I had stomach pain, periods (before induced menopause) or any other pain in my internal organs I have experienced similar pain as you do. I am always trying take care of primary pain sites. Usually it helps. I would suggest checking your other organs for non-cancer related illnesses, just to be sure that your liver, kidney, bladder stomach are working well and causing your pain. I hope it helps, please write me. Hugs. New Flower",

Clinical studies for Tamoxifen showed than going beyond 5 years significantly increase a chance for uterine cancer. Therefore it is recommended for 5 years only. As Rena has mentioned 5 years is the Reporting National statistic across all cancers. Each type and stage has its own specific numbers. I also was told by my doctor that recurrence from initial diagnosis directly indicates the aggressiveness of cancer and ability to control it. As longer patient stays with NED the more controllable the cancer is. Wishing everyone to stay with NED forever",

It is too early to understand weather or not it has been working.  She is also attending sessions at Santa Barbara Wellness Center. Your positive thoights and prayers have been helping her to stay strong. I personally have been through few challenges during past 3 weeks. Today signed up for a Clinical trail study with an experimental drug BKM120, a lot of tests are coming during next week. Hugs Olga  February 24 , 2013 i wish I had better news to share. Results are in and they are not good. The scan showed (she wrote): that the cancer almost completely involves my liver. We are trying the Xeloda. The doctor is very shocked and very worried about me\" If you read this message, please check-in and use all of your spiritual power, power of words and prayers to help Claudia turn the corner in this unfair fight. She has been a member of our CSN board since 2003 and helped and touched life of everyone on this board.  I do believe our positive energy and prayers will help her going through this critical time. I modified my 1-week old thread, because it easy for me, sorry folks February 16 I know many of you have been keeping Claudia close to your heart. Please continue to do it as she is going through difficult time.  We have exchanged several messages . While she is currently on a two-weeks break from Chemo before changing therapy to Xeloda, she got UTI , was on antibiotics which she had to stop due to horrible stomach pain. The origin of pain is under investigation and PET scan was performed yesterday. She is on pain medication, very tired from various doctors' appointments.

My oncologist never mentioned about base line before starting Tamoxifen, Since I was very fragile after 8 months of treatment I saw a women hell doctor who sent me for a base line in May. To everyones surprise ultrasound showed thickening of uterus. I was sent to gynecologist oncologist for consultation. He called it Tamoxifen effect - flux on ultrasound, monitor me and 3 months later did biopsy which was benign. He also has become my gynecologist who monitor me every 4 months. My doctor does ultrasound himself, he looked at the screen and can my adjustment or obtain a different view and it is much better than read description Yes, it is a good idea to see a specialist, surgeon or gynecologist/oncologist with good reputation.Second opinion is always useful. Do not worry before you learn more about your conditions. Chemo probably mixed up you hormone levels and your body reacted somehow. I personally would stay away from the doctor who prescribed hormones to a hormone-dependent breast cancer patient. Good luck and let us know. Hugs",

The best lymphedema therapist have been trained in Australia or Europe (Germany). Thanks and Good luck. New Flower",

TRAM reconstruction is a major very invasive operation and recovery from it takes up to 12 months. Very often patients feel very fatigued and depressed. Please talk to your doctor about it. I had DIEP Flap reconstruction on my left side 4 years ago. I am ok, my breast are not even, so what? To me Appearance is less important than your soul, your spirit and your mind. Numbness will go away as you recover from this surgery. Massage and physical therapy can help.Unfortunately, my cancer has returned and I am back in treatment undergoing Chemotherapy.

All radiated areas were as well-done steak by the end of 36 treatment. You definitely need a special cream to address your problems. I was given Silverstin to avoid infection. On regular basis I used Aquaphor, which i hated but it did work. As for lympgedeme, I do have it as well, just apply moisturizer and pray. Nobody will suggest stopping Radiation because of lymphedema, however in my case it became worse. It took me 4 months of Physical therapy to get back to pre-radiation situation. Unfortunately I still have it. Hugs",

That is why we all have been dreaming about traveling, learning about different cultures, meeting new people,and making new friends. Who wants to see a doctor? go to oncology clinic and discuss cancer treatment? I have not met such people. I was in London four years ago, traveling with my husband on a business trip, while tumor was growing under my armpit. I still remember this beautiful city and hoping to visit again.
