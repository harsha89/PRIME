I finally asked him if the doctor told him something he didn't tell me because I knew I was going to be fine....he got the message. However, our men go through rough times, too. They're afraid of losing us. I guess it's human nature to fear the worst. Good luck, Sue",

But all the stitches on the chest and underarm with part of your anatomy missing isn't pleasant. In my case, I am heavy, I have golfballs in my armpits which will have to be removed six months after surgery. Plus, the drainage tubes were frustrating. I had 3 which drained into what looked like grenades..mine took about 2-3weeks to drain before they could be removed. I don't know if I would want to put a 93 year old through all that. However, I really can't tell anyone what to do...it's really a personal decision how aggressive one wants to treat their cancer. God bless. sweet-onion",

The chemo and Tamoxifen target breast area.Am I being too aggressive in my treatment? Are both really needed? Doctor thinks so. Doctor gave me all kinds of percentages, but when I left his office..I thought did all the women in the studies have double mastectomies? I know I'll ask him next time I see him...before chemo starts. I still have my drainage tubes..won't even start chemo for at least 3 weeks.I do have appt. for 2nd opinion.
