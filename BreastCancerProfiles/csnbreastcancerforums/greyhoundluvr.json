      "Content": "I was about 17 days out from my first round of CT when I noticed the hair loss. Wierdly enough, I had brushed my hair (checking of course to see if it was coming out) and saw nothing abnormal. Then I washed my hair and it must have just unglued whatever was holding those little follicles in place and I started pulling out strands. Of course, once I saw that, I had to keep running my hands through my hair all day to see if I was imagining it. My daughter came over after work and cut it and my husband shaved it. At first we cried but by the end we were laughing. I think it was harder making the decision to do it than actually havingit done. By the time we finsihed, it was a relief to have checked off one more box to recovery. Even now the little stubble will fall out when I \"wash\" my scalp (and I too use the lint brush). My scalp seems to get very dry at times but when I have my husband re-shave my head, it returns to healthy looking and soft so I am keeping mine shaved. And I am with the \"I hate the wig\" club...the only place I wear mine is to the plastic surgeon's office....",

Then if you decide that you feel up to attending, changing your mind will be a pleasant surprise. I haven't had any major events come up that I had to miss but I have had to get my family to understand that how I feel can change on a daily basis - this disease and its treatment are really a roller coaster ride. I'm sure if you explain, your family will understand and find ways for you to be involved that don't involve heat and crowds. I wish you the best! Chris",

      "Content": "It may make a difference what chemo yu are on. I was on cytoxan and taxotere and mine started coming out on day 17 although I have seen others post dates before and after that. I got a little tenderness of the scalp before the hairloss started. Also, mine didn't come out when I brushed my hair ('cause I sure was watching for it) but first presented when I washed my hair so don't be surprised if this happens. Hang in there with the chemo. I know a lot of ladies have said that their symptoms got worse the more treatments they had but I was just the opposite. I am getting ready for round 5 and my symptoms have actually gotten easier each time (and I am certainly hoping that trend continues). I also got an infection after the first round and have done fine since. Hang in there! Chris",

      "Content": "I agree with MyTurnNow - if this is the first visit with the oncologist, you will probably be a little overwhelmed with all of the information - especially if you are in that \"gray\" area of the oncotype score where a decision has to be made about chemo. I had my daughter and my husband with me and to this day (I have finished chemo and getting ready for rads), there are things that one of us heard but not the other. I think between the three of us, we have a pretty good recollection. If your oncotype score is low, I would doubt there will be any pressure to make a decision about what you want to do on the spot. If you have another set of ears and/or someone taking notes for you, it can still be your decision what you wish to do. Best wishes - I hope all goes well for you!",

Some of the meds that they give you for the nausea work directly on the brain. Some folks have trouble with the steroids and may develop a steroid psychosis. Like everyone said, the best route is to talk with the doctor and let them help figure out what is going on and how to attack it. Good luck!",

I like to keep my hands busy especially if I am sitting and watching TV and work on a lot of different craft projects - my therapy of the month! I found that a lot of my hats were too hot to wear as it got warmer so I made a couple for me out of cotton with a slight amount of elastic. I liked them so much that I just started making more to give away. My onc saw the one I was wearing when I was getting labs drawn one day and asked where I got it - when I told her I was making more to donate, she gave me a list of 9 local places that would want them. I got onto this when I heard at the wig/hat shop that Medicaid and Medicare would not pay for any of these let alone the folks who don't have insurance. It is probably more therapeutic for me but it makes me feel like I am doing something useful....so NC will have a supply as well!",
