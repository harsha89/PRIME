      "Content": "I thought I would get through this just like the 1st chemo. As the next date approaches I am getting more and more depressed and irritated. Just don't want to lay down and let the stinkin' truck roll over me again! So tired all of the time, and friends and family want me to participate in visits I just can't do it! People want to come over and I avoid it because my house is messy so I would have to clean and I would have to go grocery shopping to have something for them to eat. And then there are the ones that want me to commit to coming to them...which is almost an hourly thing with me because I am bone tired. I keep sitting down to rest then fall asleep. Then other times I feel ok and they can't understand. GGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. My sisters, should I just let them come over and pick through the fridge themselves to find something? and wade through the dogs' toys to find a seat on the couch that needs cleaning too? I want to have some energy to care damn it.",

Still, we need it to do a couple of things that I am aware of. I know it is a big inhibitor of allergic reaction to the chemo drugs, and it is used as an anti-nausea. Do you know what it is supposed to be doing for you for the rads? Almost there....can you smell the coffee at the finish line? I can hardly wait until coffee tastes like coffee again. I hope this week seems to fly by for you! {{{{Hugs}}}} Rebecca",
