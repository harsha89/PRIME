    "Content": "A few months after radiation therapy for breast cancer, a lymph node on the collarbone started to become sensitive and slightly reddish.  This has progressed for more than 2 years.  I began to seek answers 2 years ago but no one of the 13 Drs I visited could come up with a diagnosis, including the Pain Center clinic, which gave me several steroid injections.  2 years of MRI,  xray and CT scans didn't help.  A recent visit to a new pain clinic found a Dr who diagnosed it as radiation neuropathy.  This is a rare, gradual injury to nerves from the neck area to the top of breast area.  I am now in excruciating pain of neuropathy.  Symptoms are burning sensations, ache, stabbing pain, redness, painful to touch.  Dr put me on 30 mg of Cymbalta (gen), but it has not completely calmed the pain.  I go for further evaluation next week.  I am using in addition, Arnica gel, lidocaine gel, asprin cream, menthol.  which helps. This condition is very rare and perhaps under-diagnosed because symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear.  Curiously, my Radiologist claimed  that this injury was not caused by radiation.",
