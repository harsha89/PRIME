My oncdoc gave choices and basically said you need to choose how aggressive you want your treatment to be and here is the prognosis for each of your choices. I went aggressive with both chemo and rads and do not regret it. Make your decision an informed one, and you won't regret it either. Best to you on this journey",

I would like to add that THIS, the initial shock and terror of waiting for details and confirmation were the worst part of the whole journey for me. Once you know, whatever it is to be, you will probably enter a different mind-set ready to deal with your options and the terror will hopefully ease as you focus on the next step. Hoping for the best for you.",

I did this, emotionally alone with basically the hospital people my support having no family or friends where I live. Believe me, not having to worry about paying for treatments and scrips is a big deal. You can do this, you put up for all this time.

Everyone is different, tolerance is different, perception of the big picture is different. Do what you think is best for you but I do not feel that there is anything  really horrible that might happen that it isn't worth a shot.  But that's my take on it.
