    "Content": "Just got back from my last treatment, woohoo! It will be nice to have that 2 hours a day M- F back, I probably won't be able to get through a whole day of work! It probably won't sink in until tomorrow, when I don't have to get in my car at 9:45! I've been really lucky, I have a little fatigue, but it usually doesn't show up until about 8 or 9 PM, so just in time for bed! My skin is itchy and red, but otherwise okay, I have been able to wear one of my older bras, so all in all, it's not been bad at all. I am thankful to the wonderful techs who saw me everyday and the kind, warm women I met in the waiting room, the best part of the treatments. Drinks are on me! Eileen",
