      "Content": "Hi Kathi! I used PURE Shea butter for my radiation skin. I soften the Shea butter in a warm room( or sit it in a bowl on the stove when you have the oven on) and then mixed real Bee's wax in it to make it smooth on better. My Rad Dr. couldn't beleive the results when he saw me. I'm a true beleiver in it. Also the Shea butter is GREAT for the skin anyways...softens,heals and lightens age spots. Cindie",
