      "Content": "I had my bilateral mastectomy on Friday, with all lymph nodes removed on the rt and a sentinel biopsy on the left.My pain level was awful, but tolerable with the meds. I am still taking pain meds. My awesome husband is emptying my 4 drains and putting my bacitracin on my stitches for me, which is so incredible to me! I received my pathology results on tues night from my surgeon. There was NO cancer left after my chemo!!!!!!She was shocked as she has only seen this in 3 other patients who had chemo before surgery to shrink giant (one was over 5 cm and 2 smaller ones) tumors before surgery. She cried, I cried, my sisters,mother and aunt cried. It was all worth it! I feel like I can do this now, I am still having pain, but I can do it!You all have been lifesavers for me and I can't say enough to thank you!!!!HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!monica",

      "Content": "I think most of us are in denial until the surgery day comes! I work for the hospital where I had my surgery, I thought I was fine with it until I went ob the surgery scheduler and saw my own name w/bilateral mastectomy right next to it! Then i went and threw up!!!!It is losing a part of your body just as much as any other, so don't fell like it's wrong to feel loss. I hope everything goes well for you!! Good Luck! monica",
