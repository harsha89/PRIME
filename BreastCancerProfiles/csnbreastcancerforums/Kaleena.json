      "Content": "It could be many things as the other poster had mentioned.   I, however, am experiencing left arm numbness, pain and tingling.  I have had it since about March.  I have it every day and it keeps me up at night.  It started prior to this with a stiff neck and I could hardly move my left arm.   I went to the chiropractor several times and it helped with the stiffness and neck issues.  However, I still have the numbness which is worse when I am trying to sleep.  I also have burniness in my left foot during the night (probably periphial neropothy).    I also saw my PCP.   I had a neck X-ray which showed degenerative discs.  They sent me for an EMG (nerve study test) which just said I had cervical radiculopthy (basically left arm numbness).  I then went and got a massage.  It really helped but I am still experiencing the numbness especially when I sleep. It is very annoying to say the least and worrysome too.   I also had an MRI of just my neck which really didn't show anything more than the x-ray.  I think they should have MRI my whole back though. If I find anything out I will let you know.   Kathy",
