    "Content": "trustinJesus is pretty self explanatory.  I joined this group in 2011 because my dad was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma.  I was terrified and after a week of being depressed and terrified  I had to let go of the fear and trust in Jesus.  My dad went through alot.  He had r-chop treatment and was told the cancer was gone after only 3 treatments.  We were soo happy and then after another 3 months they said it was back.  He then had rice treatment in which you are hospitilyzed for 3 days(multiple times) and they said that didn't work.  Then he had a bone marrow transplant on his birthday.  They again said it wasn't gone.  I just didn't want to hear the words there was nothing else they could do.  The doctor finally decided to a biopsy ( all the other diagnoses were done from a petscan) and they found out he had granuloma.  Basically he had a years worth of chemo and bone marrow transplant for nothing.  He did originally have nhl but other doctors have told my dad it was probably cured after the first 3 treatment.  ALWAYS get a biopsy dont rely on a petscan!!!! My dad is doing well.  He has alot of side affects from so much treatment. He has neurophathy in his feet and has very low blood counts.  The doctors told him this is just gonna be his new norm.  I'm having lumpectomy next week and again I need to let go of the fear and trust in Jesus.  Hoping is just a benign Fibroadenoma.    ",
