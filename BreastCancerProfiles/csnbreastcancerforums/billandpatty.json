      "Content": "WebMD just had an article about Aromasin and the promising results from a study in the latest newsletter emailed to me about breast cancer. You can ask to get newsletters that get emailed to you on a wide range of health topics. Another newsletter I receive periodically is from Imaginis. They are usually informative and keep you current about studies and findings that relate to breast cancer and women's health. They don't have a lot of detail, but enough information when you're busy, and getting on with your life, to help keep you informed.",

      "Content": "Congratulations! I'm a 4 year survivor and am amazed at the \"gift\" I received 4 years ago. Like you, I had all those same feelings you had -- \"if I could just get in some more time\" ... So I have looked at the time I've had, which I view as my gift, and what joy I've experienced in the last 4 years -- even out of very simple things like the sun shining (I live on the West Coast and it's been absolutely beautiful for about 10 days, it's hard to believe it's only March, not late June). My children were in college when I was diagnosed, but I still wanted to see them graduate, start careers, marry? and have grandchildren. I also wanted to live longer in my marriage -- it's been a good one. Cancer (I was also diagnosed with melanoma last year -- 10 months surviving that one) has tested our marriage and has shown us all the different kinds of love you can have for one another. Our relationship is better and deeper than it was 4 years ago. We also laugh more -- at really silly things. I don't want to sound like it's been a piece of cake -- it hasn't, but all of this has made me (us, including my children) more grateful for what life really is and what really counts. I thought I knew before the cancer diagnosis, but I didn't, not completely. And maybe that's a life long quest that makes life interesting and alive; trying to figure out what it's all about. Thank you for sharing. It does give us all hope to know that you can get on with living a long time. And now I'm helping to plan my daughter's wedding -- what fun and joy we're having. It's quite a process but also an honor to be included in her helping plan her dream day. Take care.",

      "Content": "Ida As you know, all of us have had a life altering experience. You're not selfish, you're looking at the world and your family like you've never looked at them before. I can identify with you about wanting to go and see things and feel \"free\" (at least that's my feeling). I like to plan getaways, even short ones. I took a business class last year that the instructor said we should all have a \"ticket\". A ticket for a trip, a concert, etc., that that gives us something to look forward to -- and I agree. Since I had b/c 4 years ago and melanoma last year, I get going in-between! As far as traveling without your husband, hopefully you can work that out. Remember, he's been through a lot too. And if he was anything like my husband, he was your savior. I've had to reassure my husband that I love him more than ever and that my outbursts or \"new\" outlook on life is just that, that I have a different perspective now. And he's still my life, but I have to do some things and I think about things a little differently now. I think my husband has a fear of loss when I'm not around. We do lots of phoning each other when I'm away. (we plan getaways together, too). I don't think he loves the idea that I go without him (usually to/with my daughter or a girlfriend), but he knows that I need the \"getaway\" once in awhile. Have a fun time at DisneyWorld, enjoy your daughter and reassure your husband that you're ok. Patty",
