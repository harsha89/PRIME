    "Content": "Hi Chris, I've never posted before but wanted to give you some info and encouragement. Yes, deciding whether to become pregnant after estrogen positive breast cancer is a serious decision, but the newest research is more encouraging than you would think. Some studies show no increased risk of recurrence after pregnancy. I'm 30, was diagnosed last April, and after chemo, lumpectomy, and radiation, am currently on tamoxifen. It is definitely possible to get pregnant while on tamoxifen, in fact it's used in some countries to stimulate egg production in fertility treatment, but doctors advise against pregnancy while on it because of the chance of birth defects. My doctor wants me on tamoxifen for at least two years, then we'll regroup and talk about the possibility of pregnancy. I have a 3 year old daughter and would like another child if everything goes well. Here's some websites that have helped me as I've searched for info on the possibility: www.youngsurvival.org, www.fertilehope.org, and www.lbbc.org. The last one held a teleconference on the subject recently and it was full of great information. You might be able to get a transcript. Good luck in your decision and God bless!",
