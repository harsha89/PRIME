      "Content": "Hi again Linda It will get better. It just doesn't seem like it will right now. But I have been through A LOT of crap in my life (cancer, divorce and later modifications, cancer AGAIN) and it always seems like it will never end. There are times you think you just can't do it. Then you say, \"God, I just can't do this\" and then you realize that NO ONE could, and you let it go or give it up to God or something. And then you feel better. And then you strangely have the strength to do it anyway. It seems so impossible at the time, but then you get through it and it is over... I have been relying on work as well though to keep my mind of things. And your hair will grow back! So sorry they have to postpone your one reconstruction though. Complications are NOT fun. Here is mine... I have been trying to heal from my sentinel node biopsy two weeks ago and my armpit is swollen like I have a chicken's egg under my arm. It has been getting worse so I called today to find out that that isn't NORMAL. THe nurse told me it was fluid accumulation and when I go in tomorrow they are going to numb me up and take the fluid out. I will also get my PET scan results to see what stage I am. Part of me is discouraged from the complication but the other part is relieved that they can do something. I think unmanaged pain is one of the most discouraging things about this process. They told me to go back on my Percocet to be comfortable and I already feel better. I just hate taking narcotic pain pills because I don't want to get addicted to them.",

      "Content": "Hi Linda I lost my hair from chemo back in 1995 and will lose it again in less than a month. I had very fine hair anyway so for some reason I didn't mind. I figured if I had really GREAT THICK LUXURIOUS HAIR that it would have been more devastating. Since my hair was kind of crappy, I didn't mind losing one of my worse features. My best feature is my eyes and you could see them BETTER when I had no hair. :) So I wore a ball cap that said \"BAD HAIR DAY\" and a floppy denim hat with a flower on it and took it in stride. I was bald about 9 months and it grew back a little darker and a little thicker. Let me tell you, washing your scalp in the shower with shampoo and then towel drying it is so NICE that I never went back to having longer hair. I keep it short and it is quick and easy and cute. Now I have to have a bilateral/reconstruction combo around October this year and I am much more worried about that. Grieving the loss, dealing with the pain and recovery. How did you get through THAT?",
