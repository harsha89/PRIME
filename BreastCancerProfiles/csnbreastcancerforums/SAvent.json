    "Content": "Aaahhh yes, very normal unfortunately. You may notice a bti of difference based on mestrual cycles etc. I sometimes even have what I call \"phantom pains\" where for lack of a better description its like my breast is looking for the part they took away. Almost like shooting or throbbing pains directly to the area they removed. Ive found different levels of relief by either applying or removing support or pressure and or hot and cold packs,, depending on the feeling. One piece of advice I took seriously from my doctor was to do whatever I had to do to make myself comfortable no matter how strange it seems to others. I may have a soft sweater with the bra on the outside because I need the soothing support but be completely naked otherwise because Im having hotflashes.. LOL Best of Luck!",
