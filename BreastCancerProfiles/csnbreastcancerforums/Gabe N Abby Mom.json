Keep feeling better and better, and post as you can. Hugs, Linda",

So I always chose the more aggressive route. I chose a bilateral (more because I wanted to be even) and I'm content with that. You've got lots going on here, and I think a second opinion is warranted, At the very least, you should talk with your current onc to eliminate your confusion. Ask for a long appointment so he is not worried about his schedule, and ask all your questions. Present your thoughts on aggressive treatment and why you think a bilateral is better for you. Write everything down before you go in so you don't forget anything in the appointment. I wish you well with your treatments. Please come back and let us know how you're doing. Hugs, Linda",

If your onc is too busy to see you, you should consider a second opinion or another doc. I think you know I'm also stage IV, TNIBC. When I asked my doc about 'how long' I was told 'as long as it's working'. I have had one break from chemo...I was working full time and doing chemo. I exhausted myself, so I took a leave of absence and a break from chemo. That's also when I started taking celexa, and it has made a difference for me. It didn't make an immediate difference, it takes a while. But I started feeling more like me, instead of zombie me going through the motions. I don't know what chemo you are on, or what's appropriate for you. But I do know there are lots of options, you might ask about what those other options are in your case. Some of them might come with fewer side effects. It's good to hear from you. Keep coming back. And best wishes. Hugs, Linda",

Got confirmation of IBC within a couple days of that. Three weeks after confirmation of bc, I had the first chemo treatment. I get TAC, 3 weeks apart. I've completed two treatments so far.

The appointment is at noon (pacific time)on Friday, and I should have the pathology report Wed or Thurs of next week. Everything else went very well at the appointment.

Does it improve insurance coverage and make treatment equally available for everyone? And, as you say, what about all the other kinds of cancer? So it does bother me when 'pink' is simply a marketing tactic. I am not so bothered when I think about the changes in treatment in the last 10-20 years...that's the catch 22 for me.

If they didn't give you exercises ask to see a physical therapist, they will certainly be able to help you get your range of motion back and eliminate some pain. In my case, the exercises were very gentle stretches. Definitely ask about follow up. You should always be able to get questions answered...remember you pay for this service, they work for you! Some common protocols for follow up are regular visits (once every 3 or 6 months), maybe blood tests, maybe additional scans. Every time I see my onc, I always have a list of questions.

His reasoning for this is that mets (my worry) are rarely found on tests early enough to make a difference in treatment or in results of treatment. Add to that the additional stress of testing, waiting and worrying, additional radiation exposure...this all means that the bottom line is there is more on the bad/risk side of the scale and less on the good/benefit side. I will also say that when I'm symptomatic he is quick to jump to a test, he's not likely to 'wait and see'. I recently had pain in my ribs and he quickly ordered a bone scan. Thankfully it was all clear. I hope this helps. Hugs, Linda",

Regardless, if it were me, I would want to see a copy of the medical records while your sister-in-law was in the hospital. I would want to see who ordered and approved the stent, and exactly what was, and what was not, administered via the stent. Then I would want to read everything else in her record.

Friday was a long hard day, and having you with me truly made a difference. The hardest part was hearing the words \"stage four metastatic breast cancer\". Although I knew in my heart of hearts this was case, hearing my onc say it aloud made it final. That little part of me that hoped it might not be, that part that was still in denial, died. I am now taking Xeloda, two weeks on then one week off. I started yesterday...those first pills were pretty hard to swallow. There was something emotional for me (I haven't figured out the right words yet) about giving myself the chemo, instead of an IV injection given to me by someone else. I am feeling a little more settled about it now, and as I take the pills I think about those pills building a fence around the cancer cells to contain and kill them. As for surgically removing the two lymph nodes by my lung, that won't be happening. Even the least invasive surgical option is too invasive...any benefit gained by removing the lymph nodes would be lost in time off Xeloda while recovering from the surgery. As the thoracic surgeon said, recovery from a needle poking a lymph node is a couple days...recovery from removing lymph nodes is two to six weeks...weeks that the chemo could be working on your entire body. So today, I will use my will power and push cancer aside, I will not dwell on the cancer. Instead I choose to enjoy today with my friends and family. I wish the same for each of you. Hugs, Linda",

I didn't notice it so much when I did the TAC chemo...just too many drugs in my system then to pinpoint what caused what reaction. I did whole brain rads recently and decadron was prescribed for the swelling...it made me very antsy, couldn't sleep, wanted to eat all the time, it'll make your face round, many gain weight on decadron. It took me about two, maybe three weeks to taper off. I'm on it again to help deal with shingles, 4mg 3x a day. I don't know how long I'll be on them this time...but each time, the SE's have been worth it because the benefits outweigh the problems. I hope your experience with decadron is an easy one.

The ladies at the wig shop said 'yep, it's starting'... so they see a lot of that. Someone explained that the follicle is doing everything it can to hold on to the strand of hair, and the chemo is causing the follicle to open up...that's what causes the itchy. It made sense to me. As for how it fell out, I didn't have so much on the pillow or in my food but every time I touched my hair/head there would be a handful. (One note, if you are scratching your head, just use the pads of your fingers not the nails. You don't want to create any broken skin, and the skin is extra sensitive.) I combed my hair one morning, my hubby saw the trash can, and said \"are you pulling it out?\" because there was so much hair. I hope this helps.

Hopefully your family can come be with you, but regardless we will be there to help too. It seems like the most immediate concern is the upcoming mastectomy...I had a bilateral in Jan. (Simple/prophylactic on the right, modified radical on the left, no reconstruction at this time.) I'm glad you've got your post mastectomy garments, they'll help you a lot. And the note about moving things to a reachable height is really important. Another reminder, you'll only be able to lift 10 lbs or less for a while. I was also told no repetitive motions (vacuuming/weeding) for six months. Have you talked with your doc about drain care? For me, they were very annoying. I kept the last one for 3 weeks. Others here have had theirs for longer. Also be sure to talk with your doc about what exercises to do and when to start them. The exercises will help you get your range of motion back. Finally, be sure to talk with your doc about Lymphedema. You're already at risk because of your lumpectomy and a mastectomy increases the risk, especially if lymph nodes are removed. There are simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk...no blood pressure, IV, needles on your risk side...there's more so be sure to talk with your doc about it. I found it easier to sleep, and to get out of the bed, when I was elevated. I used a wedge pillow and a couple of bed pillows. I also used smaller pillows to position my arms comfortably. Some here have slept in recliners following their surgery. As for pain management...you will have less pain if you take the pain pills as scheduled. Don't wait for the pain to get really bad before taking something. Then once the pain pill has kicked in, that's the time to get up and walk a little, even if it's only to the toilet. Oh yea...my second trip to the toilet at the hospital, I felt a little wobbly. So I used the hand rail to support me as I sat down...DO NOT do that! It hurt worse than anything ever for me and stayed in the hospital an extra day until we got the pain under control. I hope this helps you feel stronger and more ready to face this journey. Remember, whatever comes we'll help you get through it. Please come back and let us know how you're doing...ask more questions as you have them. Hugs, Linda",

I think it's a big giant game of russian roulette...some of us get cancer, some alzheimers, some get parkinsons, or heart attack, stroke, MS, ALS...the list is long. I hope my story will help you get through dealing with your open wounds, I'll try and be brief. Aug 2010 I was dx'd with triple neg inflammatory breast cancer, straight to chemo. IBC also automatically means mastectomy, and no reconstruction for at least a year. Then rads, I did 44 rounds, 2x a day for 22 days. A year later I had a local recurrence, and additional testing showed mets to the lymph nodes between my lungs. So re-excision surgery to remove the local recurrence and then chemo for the mets. Because the area had been so heavily and recently radiated, and because I was on chemo (Xeloda) the wound wasn't healing. For four months I had weekly trips to the nurse to clean the wound and decide what the next steps should be. Eventually, she said \"Wow, that's skin. I don't have to see you any more.\" It was actually bittersweet because we got to know each other pretty well in those 4 months. What I hope you get from this is that with persistence those wounds will eventually get to healed. Are there times when the daily care and regular wound checks gets to be a drag? Oh yeah. And that's what this board is for. We will always listen, and do our best to lift your spirits. BTW, I have long ago decided no reconstruction for me, ever. I have enough other stuff to deal with. I don't need or want any additional surgeries. For me, it's a little like Kat's timeline. Once I stopped thinking about the possibility of reconstruction, I had a sense of relief, a worry removed. I hope this helps you. Please let us know how you're doing. Hugs, Linda",

      "Content": "Hi misscee, I had a bilateral, no reconstruction so I'm not able to speak to that part of your question. But some things I recommend... Your reach and the range of motion in your arms will be limited for a while, so anything where you might stretch to get to it should be moved. You won't be able to put clothes on over your head, get some things that button or zip up the front. I wore post mastectomy camisoles (mine were covered by insurance and provided at the surgeon's office), they zipped up the front and had pockets for the drains. The drains are a pain, you'll probably want help with them at first. After about a week I was able to manage them myself. Be sure you are clear about their care. Talk with your doc about what exercises you should do when to get your range of motion back. I was told I wouldn't be able to do any repetitive motions (pulling weeds, vacuuming) for six months. But I was able to do lots of simple movements (without weight) in a week to two weeks. When your doc explains the care of the drains and your exercises would be a good time to have someone else listening with you, just to be sure nothing is missed. When I was in the hospital, the nurse escorted me (and my IV pole) to the toilet for the first time after surgery. She wanted to be sure I wouldn't fall. I was a little wobbly when it came to sitting on the toilet, so I reached for the support bar along the wall and held on to it as I bent my knees. DON'T DO THAT!!! The pain from moving my arm that direction was horrible!! I stayed an extra day in the hospital just to get that pain under control. I hope your surgery goes smoothly and you get the results you want with the reconstruction. Please come back and let us know how you do. Hugs, Linda",

On one level, the decadron makes me feel totally anxious and jittery. I'm impatient (a struggle for me anyway), grouchy. And then there is another level of rads fatigue...jittery fatigue, yuck! I can feel the roundness in my face, feel it in my feet, feel it in my LE places. On the plus side, my rads onc said I could start tapering off whenever I'm ready. So I reduced my dose yesterday by 2mg. I'll stay with that till I see him again on Tuesday. Also on the plus side, only 5 treatments left, one week. I'm almost done, and the countdown begins.

Put your mug in the microwave and cook for 3 minutes at 1000 watts. The cake will rise over the top of the mug, but don't be alarmed! Allow to cool a little, and tip out onto a plate if desired. EAT ! (this can serve 2 if you want to feel slightly more virtuous) And why is this the most dangerous cake recipe in the world?...Because now we are all only 5 minutes away from chocolate cake at any time of the day or night! My sister emailed this to me yesterday. My daughter and her friend tried it with the chocolate chips, can I just say Yummmmm! It was definitely enough for two, neither of them finished their cake. ________________________________",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I did the bilateral Jan 14 of this year, no reconstruction. I was told for my dx (IBC) no reconstruction for a year. As you may know, I had a local recurrence this August. So I also had the re-excision for that. Between Jan and Aug I had been bouncing back and forth between reconstruction and staying with my prosthesis...more often feeling that enough was enough and no reconstruction. The recurrence has solidified that feeling. I'm done. No more surgery if I can help it. I do sometimes wonder if I would have found the recurrence as quickly if I'd had reconstruction. I am satisfied with the prosthesis. I feel like I have a good fit and a shape that works for my body. I do strongly recommend that you see a certified fitter once you have healed enough. I hope all goes well with the surgery. Take care of yourself and let others do for you for a little while. Hugs, Linda",
