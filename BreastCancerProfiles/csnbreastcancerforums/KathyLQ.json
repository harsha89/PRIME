      "Content": "Two blondes decided that this Christmas they wanted to cut down their own Christmas tree. So they drove two hours into the country and walked deep into the woods to find the perfect Christmas tree. They had planned the trip well, especially considering that they were blond. They were dressed warmly with boots, warm coats and hats. They had a chain saw, hatchet, a bag to protect the tree and rope to drag it back to their car. Every detail was covered. They searched and searched. They had gone to all this trouble, nothing but the prefect tree would do. They searched for hours through knee deep snow and biting wind. Finally, five hours later with the sun beginning to go down, one blonde says to the other, \"I can't take this anymore. I give up! There are hundreds of beautiful trees out here. Let's just pick one whether it's decorated or not!\" Kathy",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in 2010.   I had a masectomy, followed by reconstruction the following year.   I had a D.I.E.P. flap transfer.   It definately boosted my self esteem.    It just feels like I have a real 2nd breast, all day long.  The only thing, there is no feeling in that reconstructed breast.. only in the chest wall, and surrounding.   The D.I.E.P. surgery was a long one, I had to remain in the hospital for nearly a week on my back, no showers.   The reason for the long stay, is because it is a transplant, and they want to be sure it takes. I choose no chemotherapy and no radiation.    I am fine today, age 64. My DIEP surgery was done in San Francisco.   It is generally done in large hospitals in large cities.   To help me with my decision, I attend a number of surgical support groups where women showed their results and talked about their experiences. Reconstruction can be expensive.   Even with having insurance, it cost me thousands out of my pocket.",

      "Content": "I had a single mastectomy with an expander put in, and 5 months later, a D.I.E.P. transfer. The 5 month wait was awful, I so much wanted that expander out, as it was a bit uncomfortable when fully inflated. Each time, after the saline insertion for the expansion, I\u2019d get muscle cramps that night, uncontrollable. Kind of like getting PMS cramps, I\u2019d have to take Tylenol. And for 1 or 2 nights, I\u2019d have to sleep propped sitting up, as the weight of the expander on my chest was painful. After the week in the hospital for the DIEP, I had two more surgeries, 1 was a lift on the other breast, and the other was further refinement on the DIEP breast. If I were to do it again, I\u2019d very much want the reconstruction done with the mastectomy. It seemed like 18 months of my life were surgery after surgery, no end in sight. And it\u2019s not perfect, it never will be. The DIEP breast has no feeling, obviously. The breast lift left me with no feeling in the right nipple.. until now. It\u2019s been 6 months, and I had concluded it wasn\u2019t coming back\u2026 but just discovered tonight I\u2019ve got some sensation in the nipple. Total surprise! I do understand it can take time for nerves to grow back, even if just a little. The reason they gave me for not doing the reconstruction with the mastectomy was because they didn\u2019t have a surgery room open long enough for me, for several months. It was for their convenience, not mine. I was afraid I couldn\u2019t wait, because their lab tests had discovered I didn\u2019t have clear margins. In hindsight, I could have waited a bit, because no further cancer was found. However, overall, I\u2019m glad I did the reconstruction.",

      "Content": "I haven\u2019t posted in quite a while.   I was diagnosed with BC in June 2010, so I\u2019m approaching my 6 year mark.  Age 59 at time of diagnosis, I'm 63 today. I had a 3cm tumor, invasive duct carcinoma, which I understand is 80% of all breast cancers.  Mine was positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor expressions, but indeterminant for Her-2/neu, and negative for Her-2/neu over-expression (I\u2019m reading from the lab report).  I was told it placed me in Stage 2.   I had four lymph nodes removed but they were negative. I choose to immediately have a full mastectomy, followed by reconstruction with a D.I.E.P. flap transfer, a breast lift on the other side, and follow up plastic surgery. I initially consulted with four different oncologists and two radiologists. All advocated chemotherapy and radiation of my chest wall.   I did a ton of my own study, and I choose to do neither.  My job was \u201ccomputer analysis and programming\u201d, and I simply could not face any possibility of chemo brain.   And years back, I read a great book \u201cThe Conquest of Cancer\u201d, written by the late Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, and did believe her analysis of how to treat Cancer, she believed in boosting the immune system. I did take two different aromatase inhibitors for about 15 months, both caused such awful side effects with joint aches and severe skeleton/nerve pain, that I quit those.  Of course, I always say I have a \u2018monkey on my back\u2019.   You just never know the future.   However, due to a bladder infection I just had, and an allergic bloating reaction to the antibiotic given me, I had a complete head to pelvic CT Scan, and it came back completely clear.   So I feel very lucky today, and I\u2019ll keep trying to stay as healthy as I can.",

      "Content": "Wabbitt,         I understood Tamoxifen was targeted for women before menapause, and estrogen blockers after menapauesal.    Read up on the side effects of both. I was advised to take Femara and did for about 5 months.   Joint aches became too much and so my oncologist switched me to Arimidex.   In about the same amount of time, I begin having back skeletal pains in addition to joint pains.   My lower back pain became so severe, I went to a orthopedic MD trained in pain management.  He did a MRI, which confirmed I had a nerve in my lower back touching the background and causing my severe back pains.   Pains also radiated down my left leg.   He told me it would never get better, I'd be on pain meds the rest of my life.   Very depressing.   I could no longer sit in a chair most of the day to do my job.   I worked from home somewhat, laying in a recliner and taking Tramadol to relieve my pain. Somehow in this mess I was in, I was so fed up with the meds I was taking, I stopped taking the Arimidex.   And about 3 months later, I saw an improvement, less pain in my back.   Eventually the constant lower back pain was gone, I then knew the Arimidex was the cause.    Back to the oncologist, who said, 'yeah, sometimes we have women who experience these sorts of side effects'.  He said he'd switch me to Tamoxifen, which I took slightly less than a year. I found doing research so exhausting, but I also knew 10 and 15 minute doctor appointments were not giving met the answers.  None were pointing me to clinical studies which justified their 'medicine'.   I read about Tamoxifen's side effects which could be 1) 'blood clots in large veins', (I sometimes was getting leg pains), 2)  cateracts (I got cateracts at a relatively young age, and so did another woman my age at my local support group), 3) cancer of the uterous, or 4) stroke (I have a family history of stroke).   So I came to a decision... bad side effects?  Or go it alone and try to boost my immune system.   It wasn't a hard decision... I didn't want to live in a recliner.    For example, I now take DIM (Diindolylmethane)   I actually found the clinical study at UC Berkeley which showed the positive results of DIM fighting against cancer.    \"Diindolylmethane is formed in the body from plant substances contained in \u201ccruciferous\u201d vegetables such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli. Scientists think these vegetables may help to protect the body against cancerbecause they contain diindolylmethane and a related chemical called indole-3-carbinol.\" I take extra Vitamin A (immune booster), and curry powder as it helps prevent cancer. But none of us have crystal balls.. You might read this site:   http://www.rense.com/general72/cancer.htm I've handed out quite a few copies of Dr. Virigina Livingston-Wheeler's book, \"The conquest of cancer\" over 35 years.  I always use to think, if I ever got cancer, I'd be in her clinic in a minute... but she passed away 20 years before my diagnosis.",
