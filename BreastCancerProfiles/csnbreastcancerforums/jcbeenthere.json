    "Content": "Boy, Iam in the very same place as you Ihave had NHL, Melanoma and breast ca. I too am on tamoxifin and abhor the side effects but the alternative is notdo-able!! I can relate to each and every emotion you had. I still live in fear and that isn't good. I do expect a return one day of anyone of them. I dread the day I find a lump!!!I am a strong woman and proud of my survival not just of the disease, but the treatments. I too wish everyone good health and those who are in treatment pray,lean on others who want to help,think positive and look forward!",
