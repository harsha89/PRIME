I am awaiting the results of the pathology report from lumpectomy and sentinel node excision.  So far, what I know is that I had a small tumor which was triple positive. Were you Her2neu positive and Estrogen and Progesterone positive? I think that matters. My doctor indicated to me that if a tumor is triple positive chemo is a must and that size of the tumor does not matter. I go to one of the best hospitals in the country and they practice evidence based medicine. Did you ask your doctors for statistics? Evidence? When 2 doctors differ so much in their opinions, how did you decide which one was giving you the best advice for your chances of survival?  ",

      "Content": "Hi TY,  I have a daughter and I was just diagnosed with breast cancer. This is my third cancer diagnosis in 6 years. When I was first diagnosed, my daughter was 20 and away at college. My biggest concern was her well being. As a Mom, I want to protect her and I feel repsonsible for her well being. I love her so much and do not want to see her sad or stressed. Your Mom probably feels the same way. She is telling you not to worry because she really doesn't want to cause you any pain. She will need you to help her through this by not fearing the worst, but believing for the best possible outcome. You need to believe that she will get through this. You can help with your own anxiety by doing concrete things to help out around the house or with rides. I still have not told my own daughter about the extent of my cancer because she is so sensitive and has been through so much with my past illnesses. I was a divorced Mom and raised her alone and she is an only child. It was just the two of us. You can help your Mom by believing she will get well.",

If Icould just have the breasts removed and have radiation and antihormone treatments, I would go for it. They are telling me that they do not need to remove the breasts and they even if I did, they would have to give the chemo for a year anyway. Is the difference that I had HER2 positive?",

It is about a 90 minute to 2 hr. Drive away depending on the traffic. I have to drive through 2 city traffic jams to get there.  I was treated for another cancer at this hospital 6 yrs. ago and because I was so sick and weak even before the treatments, I relied on my family to drive me. I am divorced and live alone and my only child lives and works 3 hours away from me.  I am feel fine right now. Will the treatments make me too sick to drive myself most days to the treatment? I could find a local hospital, but frankly, the hospitals where I live are substandard and I just don't trust them at all.  What I need to know is how sick will the treatments make me?  Thanks for any input you might have! I appreciate it.",
