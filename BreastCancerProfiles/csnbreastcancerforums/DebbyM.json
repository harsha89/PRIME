I was hoping also that it would finally come to an end. And, I am hoping that when Greta comes on, she will delete the posts that started the tension. And, I hope whomever is flagging just any post will stop it, as, there is no need for it. I, like others have said, hate the CAPS! Occasionally, someone might use them, but, when they are always used, it is annoying. This board is wonderful and always has been since I have been on. Occasionally though this sort of thing happens and we always get through it since it is just one or two posts and maybe one or two people adding fuel to the fire. We will get past it as we always do. The true sisters in pink stay true to each other! I thank you too Megan, Marcia and Aortus for all that you wrote. I truly agree! Have a great weekend everyone and enjoy the beautiful fall weather.

I give out lots of smiles to people and hugs!  They are free! Thanks for sharing this!   A big hug to you, Debby",
