    "Content": "Good afternoon everyone   I am finally at a point where I can get into this site and ask some questions.  I have neurothopy - ends of fingers and feet.  Try to exercise them but doesn't seem to help much.  The feet seem to stiffen up more at night just about time to get in bed.  My last chemo was in August 2013 and the onc. says it could take 4-6 months before this goes away if it does.  If I need she will prescribe a medicine at that time but I don't really want anymore chemical in me.  I try to stay to the natural stuff as much as possible.  Any ideas would certainly be appreciated.  Prayers and fast/great recoveries to all.
