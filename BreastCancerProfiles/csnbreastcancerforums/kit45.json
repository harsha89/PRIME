      "Content": "Hey all, went to the surgeon and have chosen with her recommendation and all the data to have masetectomy of rt breast. Its not scheduled yet but will be in about 2-3 weeks. Reconstructive surgery will be done at the same time and a port for chemo . Any thoughts to guide me along? How long will I be hospitalized? The surgeon says only one night but I have two kids at home ages 14 & 11. One night doesn't appears accurate.I guess a nurse will come to my home due to drainage tubes? Not sure about lymph nodes until surgery Thanks for support. Kit",
