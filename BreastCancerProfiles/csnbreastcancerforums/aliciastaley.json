    "Content": "Hi everyone, My name is Alicia. I was treated for HD in 1991 with a combination of radiation and chemo (ABVD). I was recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer. IS there anyone else out there that's gone through the same thing? I'm trying to make some treatment decisions and am looking to correspond with others in my situation. It's unfortunate that the treatment for HD might have caused this, but I'm optimistic that everything will be fine when the treatment is over. Best regards, Alicia S.",
