    "Content": "I had my visit with my onocologist the other day and had many questions, one of which was if I was ER/PR neg or positive. She said she didn't know as the pathology report did indicate. I was the one that brought it up and not her. She told me after my radiation that I would be seeing her and she would recommend Tamoxifen. I asked if there was a test to determine if I could take Tamoxifen and she said no. I am DCIS non-invasive and will begin rads in few days. Anybody else had this kind of conversation? I know they go by standard of care, in and out, but I feel she should have this info. before recommending any kind of treatment. What if I was negative, highly unlikely but anyone's thoughts on this? Also, I usually take a testorterone shot every three months to help with libido. (poor guy) Does anyone know if this is allowed. I plan to contact OBGYN tomorrow but wanted to hear from some of you people. THanks,",
