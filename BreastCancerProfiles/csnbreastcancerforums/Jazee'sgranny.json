    "Content": "I appreciate it is some months since you posted on this site, regarding your squamous cell breast cancer.  I too was diagnosed with this cancer in April 2011.  Initially I had a lumpectomy, followed by mastectomy, 6 x FEC Chemotherapy and then went on to have reconstruction.   I now have yearly mamograms on my remaining breast and am due the next in July 2013.   Hopefully by now you will be well into your treatment but if you would like any more information, please post.",
