    "Content": "Hi Ellie I have also been diagnosed with DCIS invasive. I am in Cary, NC and will be going to UNC Chapel Hill but my surgeon is from MD Anderson which is so comforting. I am 39 years old, been married 20 years this year and have two teenage girls (16 and 13). Even though I am an oncology nurse for 15 years this was still such a shock to me! I read everything there is to read as did my mom but in the end you have to do what you feel is right for your life and your family! I am ER/PR +. I have decided to have a bilateral mastectomy. The option was lumpectomy which was difficult in my case because I have small breasts and the surgeon did not know if he would be able to get clean margins and there was a 40% chance they would have to go back in. I would also have to have radiation therapy for six weeks. I have multiple sclerosis as well so that was a determining factor for me as well. So this is why I say you have to look within yourself and see what is best for you and your family! My very dear friend whom is an oncologist that specializes in breast cancer said \"make your decision and dont look back.\" So this is what I did. You will be amazed how you will grow through this experience! The folks on this website are inspiring and have real life experience! They are great and positive and a Godsend! I am going for my pre op on Wednesday and my surgery is the 30th of Jan. I have some idea of what to expect but we shall see! I pray you have piece in your heart whatever you decide! Kindly, Debbie",
