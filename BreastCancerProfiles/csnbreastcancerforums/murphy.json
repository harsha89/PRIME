I am not at all familiar with Mets that this post is talking about but I just wanted to say you will not wear out your welcome....there is a wonderful group of ladies on this site. Sounds like you had quite a time of it all and I sure hope you are doing well and continue to do so. I am a breast cancer survivor of 9 months! Stay well. Murphy",

I also was dx two years ago with Stage I no node involvement. Had a mastectomy with no chemo. There are a lot of helpful ladies on this board so hopefully one of them can give you advice. I know that all of them are fighters and you will be too. Hugs....",

I've been filled with anxiety both times - I think it's probably normal to feel that way. Both times it's just been a mamo of the one breast I now have. I think it must be up to your onc to check the surgical side for any lumps. i got good reports both times and you will too. I'll keep you in my prayers and am sending positive thoughts your way.

Last Fall my onc put me on Tamoxifen and while it's not perfect either, at least I'm sleeping better at night. Tamoxifen is generic. The other two drugs aren't but I think Femara will be by summer and maybe the Arimidex as well. There are lots on this board who do just fine on the AI drugs. I understand your fears about a mamogram but think positive thoughts. My last one was digital and I was in and out of the center in like 10 minutes. Hang in there. Hugs.",
