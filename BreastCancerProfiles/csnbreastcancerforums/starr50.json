    "Content": "I was put on Arimidex in Sept of 09, was on it for six months and was switched to Femara because I could hardly walk on my feet it affected the joints in my toes which caused me to tear a ligament which I am still healing from. My Onc said to stop taking for 6 weeks and see if my feet were better. I go back next week to see her but still having trouble with my feet but not as bad. I'm not sure what she'll put me on next. Good luck!",
