    "Content": "My mother (age 72 Â½) had a Modified Radical Mastectomy on 09/21 with a 2nd surgery on 09/24 to stop the internal bleeding. The soonest the oncologist can see her is 10/27. The surgeon said because of the size of tumor and 5 of 22 lymph nodes as cancer, it is Stage 4. In the meantime we have had complications from the surgery. 200 cc of fluid was removed from her chest wall this past week and it starting to fill up again. No one told us to watch out for her to become anemic nor that she should have been taking vitamins until last Thursday when the fluid was removed. I live 70 miles away and was trying to take care of her long distance. I went in aleast once during the week and spent weekends with her. When I called the surgeon on Friday about the fluid again, I was told she needs to have round the clock care. So we had to find a place where I live and now I have to move all the doctors\u2026 medical, surgeon, oncology, etc. etc. etc\u2026\u2026 Why does it take so long???? We still have no prognosis, nor treatment plan. This has been unbearable. So much for great care at Parma Community Hospital. Yet I saw the owner of the skilled medical facility that will be admitting her on Monday, as she said if I needed any help to call the center and she would come to my house to see Mom (I live in a small rural city). Also they already have an oncology appointment set up for Friday. Why did we have to wait to so long. Does everyone have to go thru this ****??? Thanks, Linda V",
