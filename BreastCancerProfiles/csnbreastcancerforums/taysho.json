    "Content": "I realize my situation isn't the norm, but I had a double mastectomy with bilateral lymph node biopsy on 11-19. I regained motion in my arms very quickly and was just wearing t-shirts about 5 or 6 days after surgery, a size bigger than what I typically wore to accommodate room for my 4 drains and then just a zip front jacket. I am about 2 1/2 weeks post op and wore jeans , washed my hair in the sink and styled it with mousse and gel and wore a t-shirt and 1/4 zip pullover to my 2 week follow up! It's still a psychological thing for me about feeling the need to wear a bra, there isn'timuch there! Lol I have been wearing just tank-tops under t shirts, I went today and met with a lady at the cancer center and picked up a tank that has pouches and Velcro pillow type things that go in and with a shirt on over I look just like I did pre op! I went from a full D to having my sternum area stick out farther than where my breasts were. Pre op I went into panic mode about finding shirts that button,snap, and wrap but I never even wore any of them, I just went to goodwill for thoes shirts. I bought me 2 pj sets that the tops zipped up and that's what I wore around the house. I am 28 years old and active, not sure of your personal circumstances but for me this has been pretty easy and painless and I think a lot of it has been because of my attitude and positive outlook! I will start chemo in the next few weeks so hopefully that all goes as well! Good luck and hopefully your surgery is as easy and painless as mine was!Â ",
