    "Content": "I just completed almost a year of breast cancer treatment in December: chemo-surgery-radiation. I have been sober with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous for more than 20 years, and do not know how I would have survived this past year without the help and support of my A.A. friends. Please do yourself a huge, huge favor--just pick up the phone and call A.A. in your area, or get online, find out where the meetings are, and then just show up at any meeting. You will be given an opportunity to talk, but need not say anything if you don't want to. I would recommend, though, that you briefly describe your situation at a meeting and you will be surprised at at the warm welcome you receive. You will also be surprised to discover that A.A. is full of wonderful, positive and helpful people from all walks of life who are also a lot of fun! When I first went in, I thought I would never have a good time again, and that turned out to be just the opposite. You have no idea what the rewards of sober living are until you have experienced it. You have many, many friends in A.A. already--they are saving you a seat right now, and are looking forward to meeting you. There is nothing to fear, nothing to lose, just do it! I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Please let us know how you are doing.",
