    "Content": "Hi, My first post, even though I'm been lurking for the past year.  Not sure how to post a profile pic. Just had to respond to your Q, jpteacher.   I just started Arimidex a month ago.  I'm surprised you even have to take it, because my understanding is it's only for those of us that have had lymph node involvement and you said you had zero.  My oncologist yesterday told me when we were going over my profile that it was bascially to prevent mets in other organs other than the breast, and the risk of recurrence rates he gave me (35% with and 65% without) only applied to mets, not recurrences in the breast itself.  So i'm really confused why you need this. Anyway, I have osteopenia (surprise, surprise) and am investigating what I need to take for that.  As far as Arimidex, it is making my arthritic joints worse.  I use my hands extensively as a court reporter and type constantly, so it doesn't help.  So far, that and a very mild nausea are the only SEs I'm having.  He says they are completely reversible once I stop the meds. There is a new trial involving Arimidex combined with acupuncture, but I am going to try the acu on my own next week because I don't want to get randomized into the sham acu. group for 3 months before the real thing.  I just had an appt yesterday for my plantar fasciitis and had amazing results in just one treatment.   So that may be something non-drug related to try for all of you out there having joint pain. I will post a new thread after I've had a couple treatments and let you know how it goes.    ",
