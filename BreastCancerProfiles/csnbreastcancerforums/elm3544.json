For me the side effects grew more intense with each treatment. I took Claritin with Aleve to relieve the bone pain from the Neulasta. I had a prescription for Vicodin, too. It also helped to try and walk. The Taxotere and pain meds cause constipation. You might want to use a stool softener. My Dr recommended Mirolax. Nausea was mild and I was given a prescription to prevent and relieve it. The whole inside of my mouth got bumpy and I couldn't taste much. Alot of things tasted off. If they suggest or prescribe a mouthwash, use it. It really helps. Toothpaste burned so I got Tom's. I liked that it was not sweet, too. Get lots of rest and drink lots of water!",

I chose chemo and have had alot of problems but if I had to do it over I'd make the same choice. I felt that I had to do everything I could to fight it. Best of luck to you!",

Unfortunately neither filled the entire cavity properly so part of it was not receiving the radiation. I wound up only having 6 treatments instead of 10 and I will be starting external radiation around the end of the month or early October. I found the catheter to be extremely uncomfortable and even painful but I thought it would be worth it because this would only last a week and my radiation would have been done.
