      "Content": "Happy New Year Sisters, What I want to do for fun this new year is to get out and meet new friends. Since my divorce two years ago it is amazing how your friends when you are married turn their back on you and hang out with your ex. They didn't even come by or call when I was diagnose with breast cancer. Live in a small town so the only fun place was the bars and since I quit drinking March 11, 2011 guess I am no longer fun to them. So I want to meet new people who don't hang out at the bars and develop a new group of friend who I can trust and know what the true meaning of friendship is. Lol, who knows, maybe I'll even try dating again. OMG, I can't believe I am blushing :)",
