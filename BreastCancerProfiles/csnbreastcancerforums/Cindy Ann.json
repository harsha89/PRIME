      "Content": "I have run into a very unusual experience., I after being told 4/24/10 I have breast cancer. (my surgeon met with me and was wonderful.)I met her nurse who gave me a bag and in it was a lot of ACS material to read. The next day when I became unfrozen the fear set in. When I called my doctor she was out of town as was her nurse for the rest of the week. I reached out to ACS. Who took my infor and set me up with a phone survivor. Today the doctor's nurse called me and was upset that I had reached out to ACS. She said I am supposed to only ask them questions becauce they know my cancer and my treatment plan etc.. She made me feel like crying for calling ACS. She said someone from there had called and wanted to know why they were leaving me in such a state after being told I have cancer. I was shocked.I didn't know how to respond. I am now angry this is my body and my life why give me info and get defensive or insecure when I use it?? Help, I am now feeling I made a bad decision in choosing my doctor based on how I was treated by her nurse. I am a nurse and never have talked to any adult patient like that. I now want a second opinion but am afraid( stupid huh?) to even ask for my records. I also know this is the best ca surgeon in my area. But her nurse represents her and if this is how her nurse treats her patients and I have to deal directly with her for coordination of care. What am I to do? I am scared to death of this cancer. My mother had it. I know what road I have to travel. Long post but anyone with ideals please feel free to advise me.",

      "Content": "Well Guys, I get to see the breast surgeon tomorrow am. I still am very sick. Thrush(can't believe it)a bad cough and bronchitis. Plus allergist says no MRI with contrast. When first saw her after my diagnosis. We had a plan lumpectomy with radiation. Now I am worried that this will change the plan. Sick for a week now. Now no gadilinum in MRI test. I am worried she will now put off surgery and the type of surgery will change. I am dreading tommorrow. I am not terrified or filled with anxiety just a dread. I cannot believe I have thrush(yeast inf) on my tongue and a bad one at that. Taking meds all week to cure not effective as of yet.. I have DCIS. I am hoping she will just at least do another mammogram tomorrow. The mammogram unit is attached to the breast center I go to. I am afraid it is growing bigger as we speak.I in my rational mind know per the biopsy it is a slow growing cancer and non invasive. But my hesart says what if the biopsy is wrong.. I have read about too many people who had biopsys say one thing only to have the pathology after surgery come back different. Some positive healing energy would be appreciteed. I want my surgery over. But see no way to do it with bronchitis and thrush.. Then the MRI issue.. This is really a nasty situation for me.. Hugs and Blessings, Cindy Ann",
