We don't know how long we will live regardless of breast cancer and so the theme is constant that we must live each day and treasure the life we have chosen. I hope and pray for the right \"chemo cocktail\" for you and for a cure for breast cancer. Thank you for all your postings...you are a wise and thoughtful woman. Love to you, Luckyj",
