      "Content": "Chris, my first experience with bc, was at the age of 28. At that time, I was newly married and wanted children. My oncologist told me at that time, if i wanted children to not take the tamoxifen at all as once you do the possiblity of children is grim. I did not take the tamoxifen and had my son when I was thirty three. My cancer recurred at 36, then I was put on tamoxifen, and if reccured again when I was 40. At that point after many chemos, rads, surgeries etc. they put my on arimidex. I have now been on arimidex 4 yrs. I would seriously consider getting pregnant since you have been on tamoxifen. I dont feel that it would be a good thing... my doctors all warned against pregnancy and tamoxifen. My pregnancy was unexpected as chemo was to kill all my eggs. I am blessed. Please do all the research you can and then make your decision wisely. It is a personal one. I guess in my case if I had taken the tamoxifen, I would adopt, but it is a very personal decision. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Franny, it is so great that you are supportive of your sister in law. The other two concoctions are more than likely adrimycin and cytoxan. Have your sister drink alot of water. Before, during, and after chemo. This will help it flush through her system better. Try not to have her eat anything before. This will help with the nausea end of the deal. Have her also get anti nausea meds and take them religously before hand. Even if she doesnt feel sick. By the time she feels sick and then takes them its too late and they wont do any good. Attitude is 98 percent of the deal. The better attitude she has, the better it will be. Laugh as often as possible. The old adage that laughter is the best medicine is certainly a true one. Rest as much as she can. If she is going to lose her hair.. which is inevitable with most chemos, have her get fitted for a wig is being bald is a real issue for her. When hair starts falling out it is almost easier to take if you control it in a way and get a crew cut. Then the \"bald\" is not such a shock. Tell her to hang in there and take things one day and step at a time. Chemotherapy does come to an end. If she has any other questions, email me. I know from whence I came as I am a three time breast cancer survivor and have been there and done that and that and that. We are all here for her every step of the way. Hugs to you and your sister in law. I am proud to wear the same moccasins. God Bless you both, and all you travel down this road... Sassy",
