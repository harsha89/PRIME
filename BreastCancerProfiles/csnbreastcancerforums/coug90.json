    "Content": "Well I have some sad news to report. My best friends mom just passed away last week. Three weeks ago she was diagnosed with primary lung, brain and liver cancers and was given 2-6 months to live. Three weeks later, bam she's gone. I turned to my husband after finding out and said, 'If I ever get invasive cancer I hope I go quick too.' He just sort of gave me this fisheyed look. OOPS. Oh yeah. I've already had that. I quickly restated, 'Well IF I get diagnosed with terminal cancer I want to go quick.' Then I started to really think about it. I suppose it's kind of morbid but IS it better to go quickly? Quicker than the doctors predict? Would you choose when you could die? Would you fight anyway, knowing the doctors gave you only weeks to live? I'm kind of curious to see where my thinking fits with others. Of course, then my friend had to plan a funeral. It brought up the age old question of what do you want to happen to you when you go? She wants to be put in the cheapest paper bag you can find and be cremated. Then have a big party with U2 and pizza. She's making me take part of her ashes to Ruwanda to see the mountain gorillas (if she hasn't gone there already). Her husband has to take part of her to Italy. The last third is going to be buried under a tree on a bluff overlooking the sea in Carmel. Wow. I haven't planned that far ahead. Kind of feel like I should have somewhere for my son to go if he needs to 'speak' to me. But then, I'm not sure. Actually, the quintessential thing to do with me would be to make me into a memory diamond. You can do that you know. Since I love my bling it would be so fitting. My husband absolutely disagrees and refuses to carry out a wish like that. He said, what am I going to do with you when you are a diamond? Give you to my next wife? Give you to Mac to give to his fiance? I suppose he has a point. What to do, what to do.",
