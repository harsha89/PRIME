    "Content": "Oh no! I have been out of chemo only 4 months...I will still have this fatigue 2 years later???? Hope not. It sucks the life out of me and I'm only 36 years old. I eat about 4 to 5 times a day (I am a fruit and veggie lover), and try to exercise at least 3 days a week but I usually only get to 1 day a week due to the fatigue. I also drink the boost shakes to assist, along with my multi vitamin. It still affects me most days. I guess I need to be patient with the healing process. Thanks for the discussion, a lot of your comments helped.",
