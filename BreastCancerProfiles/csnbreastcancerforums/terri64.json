    "Content": "I hope someone out there can give some info. I was diagnosed in oct 2002 with invasive ductile carcinoma. Had lumpectomy and auxilary node removal...11/11 pos. went through ACT chemo and 6 weeks of \"agressive\" radiation treatments. All of this ended in July. I am still having a lot of swelling, redness, pain and heaviness in the treated breast especially around the nipple area and underneath my breast. My oncology radiologist thought I may have an infection, so he prescribed an antiboitic. There was no change. Both he and my meds oncologist believe it may just be that my breast is still healing ( I am 40D) and because they are so large they need more time to heal all that flesh. Has anyone else experienced this? I can't even fathom getting my mammo done yet, I can't even wear a bra comfortably, much less squishing it. Don't you think 4 months is long enough to heal??",
