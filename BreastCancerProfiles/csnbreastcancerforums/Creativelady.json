    "Content": "I'm very new to all this. Just recently diagnosed, now have the port in place and start chemo on Monday morning. After a round of chemo then I'll have the bilateral done. They found it on both sides and in 2 lymph nodes on the right side. I had no clue that they use the legs and feet to draw blood or take my blood pressure. What else do I need to know about?",
