    "Content": "I am just finishing my AC treatments and then will start 12 weekly infusions of Taxol and Herceptin. I really want to be able to improve my diet and exercise during those 12 weeks before I go back to work. I'd like to lose 10-20 lbs if possible during that time. What are the side effects when you are taking Taxol and Herceptin like this? Want to know if my goal is realistic based on how I will feel?",
