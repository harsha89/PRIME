    "Content": "When I feel panic stricken (it seems to happen often these days :)) I sit down somewhere quiet, close my eyes and image myself as a young girl - maybe 5, 6 years old. Being very, very sad, heart broken. Walking around in the house feeling all alone and lost. Then seeing my dad sitting on his favourite chair, calling me to him. I go sit on his lap and his arms fold around me. My head against his chest, he sings me a lullaby. I can hear his deep voice through his chest.... I feel warm and I feel safe, and I feel loved. That little girl is me still, and often God sweeps me up in his arms, and just sings me a lullaby. He doesn't promise me anything, don't give me anything, don't say empty words. He just holds me agains him and I can hear his voice in my whole body. You are not alone, you are in God's arms.",
