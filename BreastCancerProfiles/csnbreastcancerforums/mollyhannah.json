    "Content": "I got burned under my arm area really bad, and needed burn cream. it was very painful the last 2 weeks, Since it is a cumulative affect it takes time before you really think that you will get a burn. But i felt very happy to see that putting on the cream prescribed did wonders for my skin, and it is healing up so nice. Just hang in there ok? It has been 3 weeks today since my last radiation treatment. And the healing will be fairly quick.",
