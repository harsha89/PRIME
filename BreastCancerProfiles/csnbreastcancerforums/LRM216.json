    "Content": "I work as a legal asst. and sit for most of the day. On Weds. a.m. I noticed that my ankles adn feet were puffy. I often have this during hot summer days, when I had my period years ago, after standing for a long time, etc. By the time I got home from work my left ankle and foot had swollen even more than the right - never had that happen before. No pain in leg, no hot spot on calf - no anything. Following day I was to start my first Taxol after completing 4 AC DD every two weeks. I showed my onc my ankles, which overnight the right ankle went back to normal and the left was only slightly swollem. However, she could see that one was larger than the other and told me after chemo she wanted me to see the vascular doctor a block away (he did my power port). I met with the ultra sound gal at the vascular surgeons office and she did a scan of both my legs and told me she did not expect to find anything, but did in my left leg. She found a DVT - deep vein thrombosis. With that she faxed the report immediately to the onc and I went back to onc's office. Put on warfarin 5 mgs. each night and I have to give myself shots for seven days in my tummy - one inch on either side of belly button. Going for a finger prick tomorrow (Sat) to have my RI tested and will have finger pricks at least twice a week. Onc wasn't overly concerned and feels it is a side effect of the AC and said that quite a few people have clot side effects and that I will be scanned again in 3 months and hopefully it will have been absorbed by the wall of the vein, if not, they continue to watch and I will have to stay on warfarin. Of course, I still have to watch for pain in calf, hot spot in calf, or shortness of breath - if any of those - to the emergency room I go. Even though no restrictions have been placed on me, can still work,etc., I am very uptight about this as I have never experienced this before - but then again, I've never had chemo before either. Anyone have any input for me - anyone else have a clot problem? Thanks for any advice. Linda",
