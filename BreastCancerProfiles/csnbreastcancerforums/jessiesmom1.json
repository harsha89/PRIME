      "Content": "Hi Suzanne, I am now 8 months post chemo. I have a full head of salt & pepper chemo curls. I can so relate to you when you said, \"Being bald and in treatment was OK...This constant reminder is not OK.\" It took about 6 months after my last infusion before I felt comfortable going out in public without a wig or head covering of some sort. It was so difficult to look in the mirror and see myself looking so odd - an unfortunate ongoing reminder that I had/have cancer. Just after my 1st chemo treatment I went to my local American Cancer Society office and met with the woman in charge of their wig bank. They had dozens from which to choose. I was fortunate to find one that was nearly a perfect match to my brownish auburn hair. It was a bit shorter than I usually wore my hair but at least I did not have to \"spend any more $$ because of cancer.\" You indeed have my sympathy. It DOES get better. IRENE",

I finally went to an opthamologist to see if there was anything really wrong with my eyes. He assured me that this was a \"well known side effect of Taxotere.\" He did, however, give me a prescription for some eye drops - Lotemax. Well, I must say that they have done no good whatsoever. I will go back for a recheck and see what he has to say. Hopefully this problem will go away eventually.",

It was fascinating is a gross sort of way. As long as the nails were just black/purple and still attached to the nail bed I felt there was really nothing I could do except look at them in disgust. Once the started lifting up off the nail bed and catching on things I very carefully cut them all the way back to the cuticle and just got rid of them. While the very tips of the fingers were a bit sensitive it was not at all painful. It was certainly much better looking. Most people would not even notice the lack of fingernails unless I specifically pointed it out to them. It has now been 8 months since my last chemo infusion. I got my first post-chemo manicure last week. My thumbnails still are ridged but all the nails are a normal color. Hope this has been of some help to you. IRENE",

The general standard is on the upper chest but I have seen people with it on their arm, also. I was not given a choice and had mine put in my upper chest just below my collarbone. I think if I HAD been given a choice I would probably have chosen the chest anyway. It seems to me that with the way our arms are constantly in use there is more likelihood that it will get accidentally bumped. In addition, now that summer is just about here, an arm port will be more visible. The chest port is a small protrusion that can easily be hidden under clothing or a scarf. I do have a small scar (an inch long?) from the port insertion/removal but when I am clothed it can't be seen by anyone. Good luck and let us know what you decide to do. IRENE",

      "Content": "First let me say that you have come to the right place for support and information. The ladies (AND gentlemen) that post here have a wealth of experience - unfortunately - upon which to draw. We call ourselves the Pinks or the Pink Warriors. My initial presentation of what turned out to be breast cancer was different than yours but was stressful just the same. I had Intra-ductal Carcinoma (IDC), Stage IIa,Grade 3. No cancer was ever found in the breast tissue itself just in the lymph nodes. Only an extremely high tech Tissue of Origin Test was able to determine this was a breast cancer as opposed to some other type. This was 3 years after my husband went through a bout with colon cancer. You are so right about feeling like you are at the center of a whirlwind. That is WAY better than ignoring the problem and letting it grow. The earlier the problem is diagnosed the earlier and more easily it can be dealt with. How you tell your children depends on how old they are. It's like having the \"birds and the bees\" talk - you tell them in an age appropriate way and answer their follow-up questions the same way. My son was 19 and my daughter was 17 at the time of the diagnosis. My son lived at his university and my daughter was a junior in high school. She was living at home so there was no way to hide something of this magnitude from her nor did I want to. While she was, of course, upset I think she was glad to know that something was being done about it and that my overall prognosis was good. As far as telling other family, my dad is a doctor (not an oncologist) so I called him as soon as I started doing the diagnostic testing. He interpreted what was going on to my mom. I called my sister myself. We have never gotten along particularly well but she stepped up when all this happened. Everyone will handle this differently. Please keep us posted on what is happening. Since you are having a biopsy on Friday, I imagine you will get the results next week. We will be better able to share our specific experiences when you have your pathology results and maybe a treatment plan. My thought are with you. Do we need to send the Pink Bus? IRENE",

I am left handed. I never had any trouble at all with range of motion in my left arm or shoulder. The placement of the port should have no effect on your arms as its placement does not involve the shoulder at all. It took a couple of weeks after the port was put in until I really did not notice it at all. I had it in for about 9 months and then had it removed under local anesthetic in the surgeon's office. It was absolutely the right decision to get a port. What with 16 rounds of chemo, at least 16 blood draws, and IV fluids it saved my poor old next to invisible veins from collapse. Good luck. IRENE",

      "Content": "Red blood cells carry oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to check your blood count.The RBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit tests are tests to see if you have a low red blood count. What is \"normal\" varies slightly from lab to lab but normal for adult women is as follows: RBC 4.2-5.4 m/ul; hemoglobin (Hgb)12-16 g/dl; hematocrit (hct) 37-47%. When you have a low red blood cell count (oh so common during chemo)you may feel fatigued, weak, short of breath,have an increased heart rate and feel dizzy/lightheaded if you get up quickly. To help manage a low red blood count make sure you have a diet with plenty of protein and vitamins. Also drink plenty of non-caffeinated (sorry for the coffee drinkers) and non-alcoholic beverages. Doctors will sometimes prescribe Procrit, Aranesp,iron supplements, multivitamins and in severe cases, a blood transfusion. During most of my own chemo treatments my hemoglobin hovered between 9.8 and 10.2 which is definitely low by any standard. The oncologist was not overly concerned but said if I ever got close to an Hgb count of 8 I would be getting a blood transfusion. I am lucky that it never got to that. Despite a low red blood count I never missed a single infusion. I hope this info has been of some help. Good luck.",

It is a whole new world with its own language: TNBC, rads, mets, chemo, oncotype, PET, etc. There is definitely a learning curve. My daughter was 17 and my son 19 when I was diagnosed. My daughter was a h.s. senior and my son was a college sophmore living away at school. My 1st thoughts upon being given the diagnosis (which I suspected) was that I needed to see my children graduate from h.s. and college and see them get married (some day). The everyday reality of the illness fell more heavily on my daughter since she was the one at home. I am SO fortunate she was here to help out. Daughters are special. When I met with my oncologist for the 1st time he wrote down 4 A/C and 4 T. I kept the paper in my wallet. I had a right mastectomy. I then met with the oncology nurse to go over the treatment protocol and side effects. She threw me a curve when she begin talking about a different number of treatments. I showed her my little piece of paper and she had to go talk with the doctor about the discrepancy. Well, I ended up having 4 A/C infusions - 2 weeks apart. Then I had 12 weekly Taxotere infusions. No Herceptin as I am triple negative. No radiation either. I did very well with the A/C. The Taxotere was VERY hard on me. I have never been so sick in my entire life. It was quite an experience. My last infusion was 8/4/2010. I just had my reconstruction surgery on 6/13/2011. My daughter is jealous as my boobs now look better than hers. I smile and tell her, \"the problem is that the rest of me is 53.\" The 1st chemo treatment is scary because you really don't know what to expect. Once you figure it all out it is much less stressful. I found that it was an opportunity to catch up on my reading of trashy novels. You CAN do this and have a lot of moral support here on this Board. The Pink Bus is available when you need it. IRENE",

I had an axillary dissection that showed 2 of 22 positive lymph nodes. I then had a mastectomy. After the general surgeon was done with the mastectomy the plastic/reconstructive surgeon stepped in and placed a tissue expander behind my chest muscle. The next step was putting the port in. That was done 2 weeks later in an outpatient surgery center under general anesthesia. It was a very short procedure and I am very happy I did it. About 3 months after my chemo was over I had the port removed. That was done in my surgeon's office with only local anesthesia. I even drove myself home afterward.

      "Content": "Nancy, I most certainly wish you the best of luck. You seem to have been through more than your share of problems with your reconstruction. I had a right side only mastectomy in March 2010. I had a tissue expander put in at that time. When treatment was over I had the expander removed and an implant was placed. My left breast was reduced and lifted so as to match the reconstructed side. It was definitely not the result I had anticipated. Since my plastic surgeon seemed less than interested in revising his shoddy work I went to another surgeon for the revision reconstruction. The revision surgery took more than twice as long as the original implant placement.  She did a great job and I couldn't be happier with the result. I am, however, angry that I had to have such major revision done at all.  I think all cancer survivors are grateful that they have been given a second chance. I know that I am.  How we deal with body image issues varies widely. I find it incredibly sad that you \"feel less than a woman\" without your boobs.  You are more than entitled to feel that way though. I think with the awful problems you have had with reconstruction you have to decide when/if you are going to continue with reconstruction. At some point  you may decide that enough is enough and that you are done. My husband also did not care whether or not I had reconstruction. He left it entirely up to me. I wanted to be able to look \"normal\" when I was wearing clothes. I was not interested in dealing with a prosthesis so I chose a surgical option. I can understand when you say that you feel like part of you is \"missing.\" My surgeon talked to me about this and he wisely said that if you think about it, a body part has been amputated and you have a right to grieve its loss. The way you are dealing with that grief may be a problem. Perhaps you should consider going to see a  psychologist or a psychiatrist. I am sure your oncologist can make the appropriate referral. You should not be so depressed and dysfunctional for so long.  Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing.  IRENE",

His comments were as follows: Laetrile is a \"quack remedy\" that has been scientifically disproven many times over. He was shocked that it is still being floated as a treatment for cancer. He said the makers of this product made claims which they could not substantiate and that is a part of the reason it has never been approved by the FDA. No double-blind studies using a control group for comparison have ever been published.  in addition, due to the chemical make-up of apricot pits, Laetrile has side effects that are like the symptoms of cyanide poisoning.  While I am not a particular fan of alternative/complementary medicine I realize that some are fans. Such therapies can be used in addition to or support traditional medicine but Laetrile is not one of them. Please be careful. IRENE",

      "Content": "Hi Rhonda, and welcome to the Boards. Two years ago I was 52 when I was diagnosed with cancer in my right breast -Stage IIa, grade 3. I too was overweight and wore a very full DD cup bra. Before my mastectomy surgery I met with a plastic surgeon to discuss my options. He never suggested that I have a double mastectomy nor did my general surgeon or oncologist. It never even occurred to me to have a double since there was no real medical reason for me to do so. Being overweight makes any surgery a bit more challenging but we decided to have a tissue expander put in at the time of the mastectomy and have it exchanged for an implant after I was through with all treatment. I had the right mastectomy then had 16 rounds of chemo. No radiation. No hormone treatments as I am triple negative. I was indeed lopsided after the surgery but it wasn't particularly uncomfortable. I wore loose fitting shirts and unless someone stared right at my chest they probably didn't notice too much (or so I would like to think). I needed only 1 saline fill of the expander and then I had the exchange surgery. At the same time I had a reduction/lift on the left side. That side looked very good. It was so strange to be so much smaller but I was pleased. I was not pleased about how the reconstructed side looked and eventually had it re-done by a different surgeon. I consulted 3 other surgeons before having the revision-reconstruction done. None suggested that I shouldn't have had it done because of my weight. It now looks much better. I am now a C cup. The \"girls\" are firm and as perky as they were when I was 17. My 19 year old daughter is jealous. I certainly don't look like I did prior to the reconstruction but I can wear most types of clothes that I want to wear and buy bras off the rack. I just wanted to look more female and less like a cancer patient. Who needs that lopsided reminder every day? I have plenty of other reminders. I have found that there is a substantial difference between the skill levels of plastic surgeons. Just because one surgeon is unwilling or unable to do a procedure does not mean another surgeon won't have the skills to do something. I think you should consult another plastic surgeon to determine what your reconstruction options might be. If the consensus of opinion is that you should have a double mastectomy then so be it. If you are not a reconstruction candidate then you will live with that, too. Just be completely informed. Let us know what you decide to do. Good luck. IRENE",

      "Content": "According to the American College of Radiology - BI-RADS-Mammography, 4th Edition: Category 4 Suspicious Abnormality\u2014Biopsy Should Be Considered: (See Guidance Chapter*): This category is reserved for findings that do not have the classic appearance of malignancy but have a wide range of probability of malignancy that is greater than those in Category 3. Thus, most recommendations of breast interventional procedures will be placed within this category. By subdividing Category 4 into 4A, 4B and 4C as suggested in the guidance chapter, it is encouraged that relevant probabilities for malignancy be indicated within this category so the patient and her physician can make an informed decision on the ultimate course of action. GUIDANCE CHAPTER Category 4: Category 4 is used for the vast majority of findings prompting breast interventional procedures ranging from aspiration of complicated cysts to biopsy of pleomorphic calcifications. Many institutions have, on an individual basis, subdivided Category 4 to account for the vast range of lesions subjected to interventional procedures and corresponding broad range of risk of malignancy. This allows a more meaningful practice audit, is useful in research involving receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and is an aid for clinicians and pathologists. The optional division of Category 4 into three subdivisions internally at the facility level helps to accomplish these goals. Category 4A Category 4A may be used for a finding needing intervention but with a low suspicion for malignancy. A malignant pathology report not expected and a 6-month or routine follow-up after a benign biopsy or cytology is appropriate. Examples of findings placed in this category may be a palpable, partially circumscribed solid mass with ultrasound features suggestive of a fibroadenoma, a palpable complicated cyst or probable abscess. Category 4B Category 4B includes lesions with an intermediate suspicion of malignancy. Findings in this category warrant close radiologic and pathologic correlation. Follow-up with a benign result, in this situation, depends on concordance. A partially circumscribed, partially indistinctly marginated mass yielding fibroadenoma or fat necrosis is acceptable, but a result of papilloma might warrant excisional biopsy. Category 4C Category 4C includes findings of moderate concern, but not classic (as in Category 5) for malignancy. Examples of findings placed in this category are an ill-defined, irregular solid mass or a new cluster of fine pleomorphic calcifications. A malignant result in this category is expected. These internal divisions of Category 4 should encourage pathologists to initiate further evaluation of benign results in a Category 4C, and should allow clinicians to better understand follow-up recommendations after biopsy for findings placed in each subset of Category 4.",

I'm not sure where your sister-in-law is getting her information about ports/medi-ports/power ports, but they do not need to be flushed at home by a nurse. I got a port implanted by a general surgeon before I began chemotherapy. I was immensely glad that I did. I have small, next to invisible veins and am a difficult stick. It is a chore to find a vein and often a pediatric size needle has to be used. Believe me, I am definitely not a pediatric sized person  . Between blood draws, chemotherapy, IV fluids, other  procedures, etc. I cannot imagine being poked that many times in an attempt to find a good vein. I only kept my port in a couple of months and then went to the surgeon's office and had it removed. I am fortunate in that it has not been needed for chemo since that time. My husband had colon cancer and also had a port. He kept his in for probably 3 years after chemo was completed. The aesthetics of it didn't bother him in the least and he seemed to feel it was like a lucky charm for him - as long as it was there it wouldn't be needed. Well, it has been 5 years since his treatment is over and he has never needed it again.  I would suggest that your sister-in-law get additional information on ports before she dismisses the idea of getting one. There is a lot of information out there. Good luck to her. You are a wonderful relative to come here and try to obtain knowledge on her behalf. IRENE",

You may just absent-mindedly run your fingers through your hair and find a bunch of it between your fingers. Or you lay down and when you get up the pillow or couch cushion is covered with hair. I was able to look reasonably normal for another 10 days or so then it just looked ridiculous. At that point I had my husband buzz off the rest. Whether use you choose to use a wig, scarves, or other head coverings or even be proudly bald is up to you. I used a wig when I left the house or a head scarf. Inside the house it was dependent on the weather.  I would just like to mention that it is not only the hair on your head that is effected. It is also your eyebrows, eyelashes, inside your nose, arms/underarms, legs and pubic area. Having no eyebrows or eyelashes was quite a look. The hair will probably grow back - but differently. For some though there can be permanent hair loss. That is an uncommon side effect.  Excessively watery eyes can be a side effect. Flush your eyes thoroughly before and after chemo. Taxotere can permanently damage the puncta of your eyes. It happened to me. In my case fatigue was a big problem. Remember I had more chemo rounds than you are scheduled to have. I recall 1 day where I undressed to take a shower, showered while seated and dressed again. I was wiped out and had to go back to bed. Other people have enough energy to go to work. I most definitely would not have been able to do that.  There may be changes in your fingernails  and toenails. Mine became ridged and discolored. Eventually I lost 8 fingernails and 2 toenails. They grew back. Nausea was present but not too bad. There are drugs that can help with that. The larger problem was complete lack of appetite. Eventually I just stopped eating. Of course, the oncologist wasn't happy but said it was more important to remain hydrated than to eat. It was a good thing I was overweight to start with. I was fortunate in that I had no problems with neuropathy at all. I did have 1 bout with oral thrush. I hope that lengthy answer gives you a bit of the info you were seeking. By the way, all that happened just over SIX years ago. You can do this. IRENE  ",

      "Content": "I do not have scleroderma but I do have another autoimmune disease - Multiple Sclerosis (MS).  About 4 years after I was diagnosed with MS I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my right breast. I had a right mastectomy as well as chemotherapy - 4 rounds of A/C and 12 rounds of Taxotere. It is my understanding that Cytoxan is sometimes used as a treatment for scleroderma. The \"C\" in A/C stands for Cytoxan. I. Did pretty well on the A/C rounds and did not have an MS relapse. In fact, I continued to take my MS medication through several rounds of chemo. I was determined to do everything I could to kill off those cancerous buggers. My oncologist and neurologist consulted with one another to come up with the most effective and least toxic chemo given my circumstances. The neuro suggested Taxotere rather than taxol specifically because of my MS. Your rheumatologist and oncologist are right to monitor your hepatic (liver) function.  By the way, my last chemo was 5 years ago. My MS is in remission. I have seen both my children graduate from college which I didn't think would happen when I received the cancer diagnosis. You can do this. Keep coming here. IRENE",

      "Content": "I must say that you certainly have a lot on your plate right now. Don't you wish it was only chocolate cake? My children were 17 (high school senior) and 19 (college sophmore) when I was diagnosed with breast cancer so I can relate when you say that you do not have time to feel sorry for yourself. As moms we tend to put our kids (and sometimes our partners/husbands) above ourselves until we just can't help it anymore and crash. When the birthday celebration is over tonight you will hopefully have a moment alone to try to process all that is going on. Someone recently posted a thread asking if it was ever OK to feel sorry for yourself. In my humble opinion the answer is yes, do it then move on. You have a lot to live for. You will be in our thought and prayers as you work through all of this. IRENE",

      "Content": "Hi Angie, Welcome to the club no one wants to join. Almost exactly 2 years ago I was also diagnosed with TNBC - Stage IIa, Grade 3. This was 2 years after my husband had been treated (successfully I might add) for Stage III colon cancer. I had an excision biopsy, complete axillary dissection, and right mastectomy. I had a tissue expander put in at the time of the mastectomy. 2 weeks later I had a port put in and then I had 4 rounds of A/C (Adriamycin and Cytoxan) and then 12 rounds of Taxotere. I did not have any radiation. I had my reconstruction surgery 6 months ago. On the left (non-cancer) side I had a breast reduction/lift. That turned out very well. On the right (mastectomy) side I had the expander replaced with an implant. I was not at all satisfied with the way that turned out and on Dec. 22nd I had revision reconstruction surgery by a different surgeon. She removed the 1st implant as well as scar tissue that had become very hard to the touch. The pocket was reformed and a product called Strattice was used to reinforce the pocket. An entirely different type of implant was then put in. It was a 4 1/2 hour procedure - outpatient if you can believe it. I went home with a pain pump and 2 surgical drains. All of that is gone now and I am feeling and looking pretty good. There are SO many things I could say about my chemo experience but I hardly know where to begin. It might be easier to come here and ask a specific question when one comes up for you. Right now, I have 2 pieces of advice. 1. When the Adriamycin (aka The Red Devil) is being pushed through the IV lines by the nurse during chemo make sure to drink something icy cold. My nurse said this would help to prevent mouth sores. My husband made me a large fruit smoothie that I took with me to the office. The Adriamycin is not hung from an IV bag but is pushed via syringe directly into the tubing. I never got any mouth sores. 2. Talk to your surgeon and oncologist before your surgery about exactly what kind of exercises you can do with the arm on the surgical side(s)and when you can do them. There is an understandable tendency to protect and not use the arm on the affected side. Big mistake. The shoulder joint can develop major adhesions and become so stiff that it is virtually unusable. I should know. This what happened to me. I ended up having to have shoulder surgery by an orthopedic surgeon to free up the joint followed by 4 months of physical therapy. We look forward to seeing your posts in the future although not the reason you have to post them. Good luck. You can do this. IRENE",
