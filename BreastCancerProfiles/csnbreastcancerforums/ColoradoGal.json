    "Content": "Get it...and let's all pray for a low, low score. It's not a level, it;s a score LOW is 1-18 INT is 19-30 High is 30+ If you're low, you're most likely golden...in the 90% survivability (10year recurrence) considered low risk, in the middle and well, that requires alot of soul searching and a test to make sure that if you are going skip chemo, that you make sure that your body will at LEAST metabolize Tamaxifin well. Any score higher than 30 would have me running to chemo treatment immediately. there is a very high rate of benefit from Chemo in this range. And you could still be early stage, Er/PR+, HER- and still have a high oncotype score...so don't guess at this, get the test.",
