    "Content": "Laverne I have never had radiation but have had a bi-lateral last November no chemo or radiation and I'm tired . I do take anti-depression which helps and maybe it would help you they do even your moods out and helps with the hormone replacement issues. You should be commended for working and going through this. Maybe if you could shorten your hours a bit if the company allows this go to you HR department and explain your situtation maybe they will back you with your boss. But remember your health comes first maybe you need a different job. You succeeded at this one you can get something else. First try the antidepressiants they may help with your energy level . Crying is not a sin its healty when I first got diagnoised I cryed for 2 weeks its a outlet and its good to relieve the tension . Take good care eat good and don't dwell on all the crap in the world I know we all have to take care of our selves financial but at what price don't let someone who hasn't walked in your shoes tell you how you should be at work if your feeling bad.",
