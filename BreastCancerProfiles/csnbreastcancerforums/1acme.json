      "Content": "I had been also told NOT to eat fresh veggies, ONLY steamed to reduce chances of possible infection. So I am eating more veggies that can me steamed or blanched. I also wash EVERY fruit veggie that I will eat in raw stage with HOT water and Sponge, including fruit that we do not eat skin .... like Watermelon, Papaya, Lemon etc. If you do not wash \"skin\" let's say Watermelon as soon the blade of knife touch the skin it will spread bacteria INSIDE just during of cutting. I also blanch Veggie and some Fruit as well (Fresh or Frozen)... like Plums, Peaches, Apricots, Apples. Who is not familiar with Blanching technique here is link - http://www.ehow.com/how_7450522_blanch-fruits-vegetables.html I live in large city and my place does not even have a balcony to grow my fresh product. I large cities it is so difficult to control what you eat. Regular production is exposed to chemicals/fertilizer so product stay longer fresh in stores and if you decide go ORGANIC - you are exposed to \"natural\" fertilizers which is animal poop/urine. Like Germany have problem with E-Coli bacteria where several people died and they are \"blaming\" fresh Cucumbers imported from Spain.",

      "Content": "You are absolutely right. Since beginning my chemo a) My body temperature raised and I am continuously hot b) Noticed to gain several wrinkles on my face and c) got sun spots (on my face & hands) that I did not have before Yes, I visibly aged in few weeks and my body is feeling like \"old\" lady Before chemo, I was medication FREE, pretty active with decent diet (no Alcohol, Tobacco, drugs), no Sodas, No Aspartame, No Milk, No Soy and drinking about 12 cups a water a day and reading carefully food labels. Chemical was bothering me before, like I could not go to Tire Shop as the smell from chemicals made me sick. Same with \"cheap\" tools with plastic handles. I also got rid of microwave and never freeze plastic bottles (with liquid) in freezer. Well how my body will react when chemo will be completed (in 2 months). Provably another shock. How can I \"help\" my body to recover from all those strong chemo drugs they are pumping in me. How do I make sure that Cancer will no re-accrued? There is several question on my mind ... I want to get better .... I want to get at least pre-chemo shape if not better I planted on our cottage some Raspberry, Blueberry, Cherries, Tomatoes, Watermelon, Asparagus and Herbs to at least control my food intake and making sure that this product will be \"organic\" as much as possible.",

      "Content": "Hi Eva I had been diagnosed this February with Tripple Negative BC at age 37. I had immedatelly Lumpectomy, Centennial note + 14 lymph notes removed from right side. I am starting chemo on this Monday (easter Monday - Apr-25). I will have 16 wks A/C + Taxol 2 weeks a part with daily injection of Neupogin. I do not have children and my Onco did not recomend eggs \"harvesting\" as he said that with my age chances are next to nothing. After chemo I will have to see back my surgeon for another re-incision and later for double mastectomy. I desided for removal of my \"healty\" left breast to lower chances of reacurrance. Good luck with you journey. Helen",
