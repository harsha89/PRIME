      "Content": "Good evening, one and all! I got a phone call from my oncologist today. He had ordered another test on my tumor, just to verify that I was, in fact, HER2 positive. The results came back negative!! The first results were obtained from the needle biopsy and a \u201cstain\u201d test. The second test, a \u201cfish\u201d was done with a slide from the actual tumor. Therefore,I will not need to be on a Herceptin regimen for a full year. That is INCREDIBLE news for me because my family has a history of congestive heart issues(2 grandparents and my dad died from it). My onc is sending some more slides to Ohio State, to see EXACTLY what we are dealing with in terms of the genetics of the tumor. I may, or may not, still have to have the other six treatments of chemo. We will know in two weeks. In either case, I will still need seven weeks of daily radiation and 5 years of hormone suppression therapy. Needless to say, I am ecstatic! I know there is still a good chance of chemo, but knowing that I will not have to take herceptin is such a relief. I know my fears were irational. the heart issues that can come with herceptin stop after the medication stops, but I had a terrible foreboding of that drug. Thank you all for your prayers, support, and good thoughts. I KNOW they led to this happy turn of events.",

My husband, his sister, and a friend are planning to bicycle across America this summer, and my 11 year old daughter and I are going to follow the same route in our car! Each morning, we will drive to their next destination (100-150 miles) and then sight-see until they catch up in the late afternoon! That way, if they run into trouble, we will be there with supplies, repairs, etc. What a great way to spend the summer!!",

I have Meniere's Disease which is aggravated with the saline solutuion, so between dizziness and the other chemo induced joys, the first week is awful, so it hasn't really hit me until today that I am DONE!! I start 7 weeks of radiation on the 15th, but for tonight I am just HAPPY! There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Have a great night, my fellow warriors!",

Pain meds just make me feel like an exhausted zombie instead of just exhausted. As always, it's good to know I'm not alone. Anyone for a canasta (or gin) game at 2am? lol!",
