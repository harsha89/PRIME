    "Content": "Very significant and I urge you to get tested.  Research points to a clear relationship between Vitamin D and cancer, including recurrance and survival.  You should make sure your level is clearly above 30 ng/ml, at a minimum.  Consensus among researchers suggest being 40 to 60 ng/l one scientific presentation here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PsyaYNX1dw   as an add on, breast cancer survivor Carole Baggerly, started a non-profit to ge the word out about the link between Vitamin D and cancer and to facilitate more research. her presentation  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ-qekFoi-o her organization http://www.grassrootshealth.net/   I must emphasis that my wife's oncologist never ordered a Vit D test.   I requested her test be done and found it was low, just above 20, and we live in Florida.   I did not at the time (early 2012) know that it takes many weeks to get serum level up if one uses only 1,000 to 2,000 IU a day, which will raise D an avergae of 10 to 20 ng/ml.   but each person is different, so please get tested and review the research.    peter  ",
