A couple of weeks ago you were preparing, dreading, waiting for it to happen. Now, it's here & soon to be behind you. I had myself so psyched up about losing my hair that by day 14 when I wasn't, I wondered why not and was relieved when it went. And, then I checked it off the checklist and focused on the next. Benchmarks have been a great tool for me, maybe they can help you, too. It's not about how many are left. It's about how many I've left behind.",
