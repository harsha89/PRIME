      "Content": "Hi, welcome. Your are so right about people and their responses.  There are is many kinds of breast cancer and treatments and every case is different. I have an aggressive breast cancer so getting aggressive treatment.  One lady today said well at least it's curable. Well that's what we hope. And regardless of the stage and grade and type it is CANCER and very scary and definitely easy for people to say things like that cuz they have no Idea. Even people response to me losing my hair. I know it's just hair and will grow back but it is still part of me being destroyed. Having cancer is hard enough and then to feel like your mutilated from head to toe.  That's how I feel sometimes.  So your are right in how u feel .   Take care ",
