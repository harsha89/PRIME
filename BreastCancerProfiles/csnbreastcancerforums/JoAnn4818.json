    "Content": "Hi Patrice, I had triple negative breast cancer, Stage 2 A IDC, Grade 3. I was diagnosed in September 2010. I had 2 failed lumpectomies - they just couldn't get clear margins because it was growing too fast. I finally had a single mastectomy followed by dense dose chemotherapy. I finished that in April 2011. I had immediate reconstruction which didn't turn out well at all. It was a really hard time for me after five surgeries and A/C followed by Taxol. I continued to work at my same job through it all. I had really bad neuropathy, I lost 30 pounds and all my hair - everywhere! I had severe anemia and was in pretty bad shape by the time it was done. I had so many people help me through it - a lot of tips on handling chemo from the wonderful people on this site especially. Jessie's Mom was the one who convinced me my hair really would come back some day - LOL! But it was all worth it!!! I've had a great year now that I feel well again. I've spent a lot of time with my husband, my sons and my friends. I really appreciate them and my life. I'm truly grateful to God for every day. It hasn't all been easy - I've had a couple of scares that at first looked like a recurrance, but they were false. Triple negative is a tough diagnosis. I know I'm not in the clear yet because it comes back so often but I try to stay positive. I hope and pray for all my sisters in pink, with TNBC or any breast cancer, that a cure comes soon. We deserve it! love, JoAnn    ",
