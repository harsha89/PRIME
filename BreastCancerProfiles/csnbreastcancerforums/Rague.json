      "Content": "We are all so different!  When I saw Dr. T. before my 10th of 12 weekly Taxol, I complained how totally/utterly exhausted I was and was told  that the 4 neoadjuvant A/C, surgery and the 9 Taxol already done had done between 85% and 90% of what could be done (I'm IBC) (plus the rads yet to come and Femara) and he'd write a script for me to stop IF I wanted to.  Well to me - I had to fight through to do evevy thing I could considering all I had already been through - I could not quiit so close to the line.  Had there been medical reasons - I would have stopped but just existing on the couch in front of the TV (to me) was not what I'd do.  Hubby, Son and Gdaughter had been there for me to let me fight the battle - so I had to keep 'charging forward' - if not for me - for THEM.  Aug will be 4 yrs since DX and I'm still (as far as I know) NED. Recon was never an option at time of surgery.  If it is done with IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) it has to wait at least a year..  A year out I was thinking about doing recon BUT it's more surgeries with the possibilities of problems.   Hubby  did not want me having more surgeries that were not necessary but if I wanted recon he would support me.  I can and do anything I want to - we've been married 37 1/2 years - I'm not the same person I was in 1975 - he isn't either. Sorry for rambling but to me - Life is to be lived to the ultimate and there are times that really 'dump on' us but it's up o each of us to allow them to put us down or make us stronger.

      "Content": "You're right - IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) does not present itself as a lump like one usually thinks of with BC. It bands or nests without clear margins. That's why chemo is done before surgery (sometimes after also) so that it will shrink into a 'lump; and get margins so it can be gotten out. It is often misdiagnosed initially. It is very aggressive and rapid in developement. Some of what to look for are redness, heat, pain, orange peel skin, inverted nipple, enlargement and nodes enlarged. Remember that we're each unique but for me, I found a lymph node enlarged under my arm that had 'come up' basically overnight. I saw my PA in a week and by then I had developed orange peel skin and inverted nipple. Had new mammo, sono, and biopsy that afternoon and had the path. the next morning. In the 17 days from DX to starting chemo my breast had doubled in size. The chemo worked and it shrunk to a lump and had clean margins when I had mast. 2 weeks after last A/C. Then in 3 weeks I started 12 weekly Taxol followed by rads. I was DX'd in Aug 09 and as far as I know doing great now - have more aches and pains and a couple of other issues but they are all handleable and for a 65 y/o that's not bad. IBC only represents between 1% and 5% of all BCs so it's not all that common. There are several of us IBCers here. There is no way of knowing rather or not the Monster will attack you. There have been no cancers of anykind on either side of my family for at least 4 gnerations - til me that is. There are some gene tests that can be done but others will have to tell you about them - were not recommended for me so I haven't read up on them. Susan",

If he does not have a counsellor he' working with try to get him to seek out someone experienced in treating PTSD. PTSD is very real and deals with any traumatic stress which being abused by his 12 y/o daughter certainly counts as traumatic stress. His daughter definately does need help for her behavior and needs it now, sounds like she'll be getting it.

The day of the last A/C I saw the chemo Dr and he was unsure if he wanted to do a bit more chemo first or not so he was going to talk with surgeon so they could decide the best route to go. They decided to go ahead with surgery and start chemo again after - so 3 weeks, 1 day after surgery (a week ago today) I started Taxol weekly for 12 weeks then will go on to rads and Femara. I'll be seeing my PA on Monday as I haven't seen her (though I have talked with her on the phone) since the day the biopsies were taken. Different cancers proceed differently and call for different protocals.

So far everything is going great - I saw Rad and chemo Drs Sept 30 and both are pleased with how I'm doing. Chemo dr wants to see me in 6 months and Rads Dr doesn't want to see me anymore unless one of my other Drs thinks it necessary. I see Surgeon mid Oct. and my PA for annual check up in Oct. There are several other IBCer's here but we aren't as numerous as some other types. Susan",

They had warmed blankies for you if cold and could turn your AC up if you were hot (I was always cold so got 'blankies' and the heat turened up). You had a call button and there was a camera that showed at the Station. For me the first infusion I got an \"ice cream\" head ache. It was slowed down and never had anymore problems while on A/C. On Taxol the first time my BP dropped so it was slowed down and no more issues. With A/C I was given oral Benadryl with no more problems than with oral benadryl I've taken for bee/wasp stings BUT with Taxol they gave it IV and within seconds of it starting I'd go 'nighty night' until about 1/2 hour before it was over. I took myself to all my Chemo' - my choice. I didn't want Hubby ot Son there watching the poison go in me. They both had their cells with them and their bosses knew that they'd have to leave IF they got a call - never did.

Doesn't bother me at all to do it that way. While I was doing Chemo, they had numbing spray that worked quite good. Now for my flushes I go to the local VA clinic for them to be done and they don't have the numbing spray there so my PA gave me the generic version of EMLA cream and it works really good - can't feel anything. I did have it accessed once for a CT scan at the hospital and they didn't have any spray and it HURT - I'd have insisted on using a vein if I had known. Susan",

That is fantastic but quite complicated to be able to do BUT for many of us who have been blood donors and thought that we could not ever donate again - we can (as long as everything else makes us elligiable). We can also be listed as 'Organ Donors' - at the time the Drs will make the decision of what is useable. The current USA national standards are with breast cancer (and some other forms) is that you are 1 yr post TX (HT/Hormone Therapy is not considered. TX.) with no recurrances/mets. The National Standards are followed by the Red Cross and United Blood Services but there are some private ones that do have more strict rules. There are some forms of CA that can never donate but BC is not one of them as long as all the other peramiters are met. Just thought I'd pass it along again as we have many new ones. I go in the 25th for my next donation. Was ready last month but they had a \"Guns N Hoses\" (Police vs Firemen) challenge blood drive about that time so they got a lot donating anyway so I decided to wait til the last week of July because during Rally (Sturgis Motorcycle Rally) there is always a lot of blood needed in late July/early Aug. So any who have been donors in the past (or would like to be) check with your local facility. Also you can still be an Organ Donor. As with anyone, the Drs at the time of death will determine what can be used. IF I remember correctly - corneas can be used from all. Winyan - The Power Within Susan",

Give each question a number and if you need more to write on then go farther back in the book and put that number on the top of the page so you can relate what you write the the right question. Take someone with you who can/will remain objective as to what is being said to you just 'in case' and have then write down what they hear the Dr say. It's not hard to hear bits and pieces of what is said. Ask for booklets/printouts regarding your questions/their answers. Ask rather or not you had a Radical Mastectomy (as mentioned in first post of this thread) or a Modified Radical. From all I've read/heard, a Radical Mastrectomy in today's world is usually only used with Stage 4 (which means it has spread) and involves taking all breast tissue, all nodes and chest muscle. A Modified Radical is much less invasive. Ask what tests were done - not just 'scans' but genetic/etc. - and ask for copies of them and all tests that have been done - even all blood tests to keep up with all levels. Ask, Ask, Ask and Ask somemore! Document, Document, Document! Remember that not all Breast Cancers are the same Beast, not are they the same within the same type. We are each unique and our bodies are each unique in how they will fight the Beast within. You can do what you have to and it is surprizing how fast the time will pass. Susan",

      "Content": "This Retreat was one of (If not) the best Retreats I've been to as far as what I got out of it. It didn't start all that great though. Somehow I didn't get notified that the inipi (sweat lodge) had to be canceled so I was there at 8:30 for it - Retreat starts at 12. So I drove to Bear Butte (Lakota Spiritual area) to be by myself remembering our Sisters and prepare for the weekend. It's about 2 miles from Ft. Meade. For those who don't know of these Retreats - they are at Ft. Meade VA, South Dakota. It is through PCT and there is emphasis on PTSD. It is for women Veterans and women collaterals (wives/SO/mothers/sisters/duaghters/etc.) of PTSD Veterans. There are many tears but there are also many laughs - it's all up to you what you do/don't make of it. It is totally free to the participants (lodging and meals included) bu tit is your responsibility to get yourself there. Tax money does NOT fund it and all the Staff (all are MH professionals) contribute their time. A generous grant from DAV and other private contributations pay for it. The next one will be sometime in Oct but date not set yet. I'll share something that happened as it happened to me so not breaking confidentiality (and I think it's sort of funny). There are 2 wings to the BOQ and all the past Retreats only one wing has been used. Well this time 2 of us got put in the other wing. After breakfast, I went back to my room. Spent more time than I thought and when I went down to get the van over they were all gone so I started walking ( about 1/4 mile). Well along came one of the vans looking for me so I stood on the road thumbing like a hitchhiker. Of course she picked me up. Someone from my quad-dad (4 who are to keep track of each other) went to the first wing and looked on the white board to see what room I was in (of course my name wasn't there) and went back and sais I wasn't there instead of saying she couldn't find my name so off they went thinking I had already walked. I was feeling silly so when I got in the van I sang the little song \"Nobody likes me, everybody hates me - I'm gonna eat some worms\". We get to the group and she told everybody I had a song to sing so I had to sing it. But I 'got back' at her a bit later saying that = wanted to file a report on her for picking up a strange hitchhiker (me) and bringing them to the Retreat. This may not make sense when written - one of those things that are only funny when they happen so if it doesn't make sense/funny to you I'm sorry but it was funny when it happened.

I did not burn at all during rads - tanned yeah but no real burn until after they were over - then I burned BAD. i did get a mild pink on day 23 and it did get a bit tender like a mild sunburn by day 25 but nothing bad but the next day the entire radiated area was burning, open and weeping. All the area did not scar but a lot did - it took 6 weeks for the last scabs to be gone - thankfully the deepest burns were in the area where nerves were gone but as it was I needed Vicodin for the other areas. Oh well, it did heal (I allergic to Sulfa so couldn't use Silvadene/Sulfadene so had to just try to keep infection out of it) and if it burned that much it certainly must have burned all the cancer cells that might be lurking in the area. One of the things I found the most interesting was that there was no heavy door going into the rad area - in fact there was no door at all! As it was explained to me was that because it's a circular room the rays can not escape the area. Forgot to add - every Thursady before rads they did X-rays - same machine/table that were sent to Dr. and then I saw him fter rads that day.",

Do not be afraid of a port (or even a PICC) as the possible problems caused by the chemo materials can do horrendous things to your veins wheninfused by 'needle sticks'.  Especially when you have veins that are already not easy to hit.  I have great veins and knew that once surgery was over there would be only one arm left to use so wanted to protect it as much a possible.  (The guy who does most of my draws always laughs that while men are supposed to have better veins than women I have better veins than most men.) My decision to do a port to start with as I had done my research and wanted to protect my veins and did not want a PICC.  When I was in High School one of my friend's little brothers had leukemia and they used a PICC with him and I did not want to deal with that.  I am a very active outdoor person/horsewoman and the potential for problems with a PICC were just too high for me.  A port is enclosed within the body and only when it is medically accessed, is it 'open' to the outside 'world'. My port wass put in in Aug 2009 and is still in.  My choice (with my Drs approval).  The 'odds' for IBC is that only 1 in 4 will make it to 5 yrs post DX without at least moving to Stage IV so to me it makes sense to keep it in and ready just in case needed (I have a vivid imaginatino - so I visualize my port as my little soldier standing guard so that the IC Monster will not try to attack again as it knows that there is already an 'armed force' ready to do battle.)  IF it's needed - then it's already there and ready - so one less surgery in the future.  Because I'm not on any chemo now, I have to go in monthly and have it flushed (blood drawn back, saline injected, heparin injected to prevent clots) and off I go for another month.  For me, I like going in monthly for the flush as I see my PA's RN and I can ask her about any questions I have and if needed she will go directly to PA and I'll see her if needed if not get answers from her..  So to me it is pro-active.

(At week 10 of weekly Taxol [after 4 A/C and surgery], I was way past exhausted and my Chemo Dr told me I could stop getting that one and the last 2 as it had already done 85 - 90% of what it could do - not good enough for me I wan it to do 100% of what it CAN do - so I made it through.) In a way, percentages of the 'over all' mean nothing to me personally - either I get a reoccurance or I don't. I am one of the ones who did BURN badly - not a bad sunburn but the entire radiated area was open weeping wounds with it taking 6 weeks for the last scabs to come off the deepest of the burns. I only had tanning and freckling until the 23rd time and after the 25th (the last I had as no boosters were appropriate) it was a minor 'sunburn' but the next day it started really 'blowing up'. If I had known what would happen - would I have done it - your betcha. It was bad and I never want to go through something like that again but I made it through and IF the Monster comes back - I can look Hubby (of 34 yrs). Sons, and G-daughter in the eyes and say it's back and they will know for a certainity that I did all I could to keep it at bay for them - I didn't wimp out because it was easier. My feeling/How I handled it aren't for everyone - but they are right for me and mine. We're all so different - not just in the particular Beast we are fighting but in our entire life's journey. (I'm IBC [Imflammatory Breast Cancer] and it is a very aggressive form that doesn't have a very good long term survival rate - so 'fighting' with everything available was what I did.). Personally - getting even 1% more is worth it to me - but that is just me. Be true to yourself and do what is right for you and yours. May God Bless! Susan",

When I was on A/C I had dense dose every other week for 8 weeks to shrink it and try to get good margins (it worked). Then surgery 2 weeks after the last A/C. Currently I'm on Taxol - weekly for 12 weeks. (Started it 3 weeks after surgery.) It can also be given every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. As I understand it from my Dr. the weekly is a lower dosage but by doing it weekly it keeps a more level amount working at a time. The every 3 week is a higher dose but does not stay as level. Perhaps someone else can explain it better. Susan",

It is very hard to do but there does come a time that the kindes thing we can give our beloved 4 - legged children is to give them a release from suffering. I just lost my 14 y/o Gordon Setter, Sat. night - I was laying on the couch watching TV, Hubby was in his recliner. Cody came over and layed down next to the couch. I don't know exactly when he passed but when Hubby got up, he was gone. I'd had him 13 yrs and he had been a 'Pound Puppy' that Son saw in the paper as the \"Pet of the Week\" (reg. Gordon Setter with his papers) and got him for me. The day I got him, he was a rather sick 'puppy' - the HS gives you a chit to take them to local Vet to get them checked out - it was Wed. afternoon and all the vets I normally use were closed (except for emergencies) so I took him to the only one that was open. The Vet told me to take him back to the HS and get my money back - he was going to die. Obviously - he didn't - I called a Vet friend in FL who gave me a list of livestock meds and dosage to use that I could buy at the feed store to use - obviously he didn't die then. Hubby lost his little Rez Puppy (mixed breed born on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation - hence Rez Puppy) to cancer in the time between me being DX'd and starting Chemo. There is a bit of positive though - the day before Surgery I stopped at the HS and there was a Black and Tan **** Hound there - the breed he wanted. Once I was in my room after surgery, I sent him (and Son) off to go see her. When he came back later he had gotten her but she had to sty there til Fri so she could be spayed. Stopped the next day to see her again when Son picked me up and she was ready to take home - they had already spayed her - BUT it didn't make sense to me to take home a dog I really did not know then being just out of mast. so he picked her up that night. I am so sorry that you and your guy are going through such hard times don't dwell on this sad time but rather embrace all the good times ya'll have had. it does not take away the pain/the loss but it doea make it easier to bear (at least for me.

Hubby had to go on the Rez to work today and he said that a lot of the way he had visiblity of about 100 feet. The last radar I looked at shows it heading east with most of the area clear or clearing out. Now as soon as the wind blows itself away all will be good. 6 am Mon til 6 am Tues we were under a High Wind Advisery (we had a gust to 57 mph at the local Middle School), 6am Tues til 6 pm today has been High Wind Warnings (yesterday gusts to 62 mph and today to 66 mph). Yesterday a wall that was being built at a R.C. High School for a new science wing that was about 30' high and 150' long was blown down. A lot of tree damage. Talked to friend who had one of the moveable lighted signs you put letters on out in front of their business - it was rated to up to 65 mph winds but it is now trash. Hopefully no one is hit by this storm anymore than they already have been - I heard somewhere on TV that is supposed to one of the worst storm to have cut a swath from the NW across such a big area in over 70 years.

Chemo is very hard on veins.  I have great veins and after surgery only one arm (neither if BMX) will be available for blood draws so I wanted to protect my veins I'd still have useable. My port was put in in Aug 09 and it's still in.  My last chemo was 4 years ago this month so I go to my Clinic monthly to have it flushed.  My choice to not have it removed - I'd rather it be there ready incase it's needed again than to have to go through more surgery to implant another one.  We are all different in how we 'look at' things.

The only thing Neulasta did was 2 hrs almost to the minute after getting it I would go to sleep for 2 -3 hours. 2 weeks after the last dose of it I had a Mod. Rad Mast. and 3 weeks later started Taxol. Taxol (12 weekly), I was COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED day 2 - 6. Day 7 & 1 I'd feel a bit better - really tired. Napping/Sleeping did not help - in fact I could not sleep, had to to take sleeping pills to get any sleep which I've never before done. The first pill that Chemo Dr gave me only let me get 2 -3 hrs sleep and gave me horrible nightmares (I don't normally have nightmares) so my PA changed it to the lowest dose of Ambien and it worked great for me. My temperature dropped - I was rarely over 97.something F (occasionally 96.something) and I was always cold. I've always been on the low side and cold most of time anyway but this was worse. The IV Benadryl that they gave me always put me \"nighty-night\". I've taken oral Benadryl with it not making me the least bit sleepy but the IV was lights out. So I got a room with a bed (it also had it's own heater so they could crank it up so I didn't freeze and they didn't have to bring as many heated blankets. This was during the winter in western SD (Black Hills) so it's quite cold here then. My BP also ran low during this time - it's still on the lower side but not as low as it was. Also had a hard time keeping enough K(potassium) as was put on fairly high dosses of it and stayed on it for quite a while. I didn't have problems with pain or neuropathy. That's about all I can think of now. OH - I started rads a week after the last Taxol, I started feeling better within the week and taste started coming back - still have no appetite. All together I lost 45 lbs and at least now I'm holding at that and not loosing any more. On Femara now.

Started Taxol (12 weekly) 3 weeks after surgery and it was nasty - I existed on the couch in front of the TV the entire time - total/complete EXHAUSTION. Still no taste or apetite. Again no nausea so I decided 1/2 way through to try not taking anti-nausea meds and still didn't have any nausea. I have been told that rather or not you morning sickness(I had none) can be an indicator in many cases rather or not you will have chemo nausea. A week after last Taxol, I started 25 rads. Rads were easy - everyday I felt better. After they were over, I did burn very bad though. Other thoughts - if you have a port check with your Center and see if they have numbing spray to use when accessing it. My Center did but I did hVe one access done in the hospital without and it HURT. If they don't then ask for EMLA (lidocaine) cream to put on 1/2 - 1 hour before access is scheduled so it doesn't hurt. Cover the cream with a small square of Saran Wrap to keep it off you clothes and to work better. I never used it during chemo as the spray worked good but Jan 29 will 2 years since last Chemo and I'm keeping my port til I hit the Majik 5 years I have to have it flushed every month which is not done at my Center but at my VA Clinic so I use the cream now. Drink water Y I usually forget to mention this as I'm a big water drinker anyway but drinking fluid is important. Any time something seem 'wrong' contact your DR or his/her PA/RN. Sure I forgot a lot . Susan Ask about \"Look Food Feel Better\" at your Center or local ACS. It is a great class for women. You will be given a bag with brand name makeup and taught tips on dealing with lokking good so you can feel better wwhile doing chemo. They also have info about wig (usually hazve some with them) and wig care. Check it out.",

He told Hubby that they had had to give me a lot of drugs to keep me out - I know they definately had me knocked out more than I've ever been - I usually wake up either in the OR or on the way to recovery. Pain meds did not help with the pain at all. The next day Hubby took me to UC (the Dr in that day is the wife of the Dr who did the Scope the day before).

It was not done because there was any belief that there was something going on - none of my CT scans, MRI, PET showed anything to be concerned about (and he found nothing of concern in the part he was able to do).

Thankfuly I had worn a very baggy/long sweatshirt - the jeans I wore in were not tight at all but could not get then within 3 inches of buttoning so I left with unbottomed jeans with sweat over them. Pain was worse that either C-section and they didn't even get the whole scope done. Susan",

      "Content": "Being IBC and it's 'odds' of making it to 5 yrs, there was no way I was going to have my port out til I hit the 'majik' 5 yrs. Look at it as my little Warrior standing guard to keep the Monster away or if it sneaks up, it's there ready for battle. Yeah - I know that's a silly way to look at it but that's how I invision it. It's been 2 1/2 yrs since it was put in and I'm still riding NED so guess my little Warrior is standing guard. Going for my monthly flush also gives me a good feeling as it is still something I'm doing actively - take my Femara too. From what I've heard - re-porting can be done but can be more tricky the 2nd time around. If it's put back. On the same side as before then there is some scar tissue from the previous one. Put in on the other side then you could have issue from the surgery and/or rads. I really don't know though - jjust what I've heard. Am sure some will have personal experiences. Susan",

No more biopsies were done until the ones done during/after surgery. That was Thursday and Friday and I saw the surgeon on Monday. I definately decided on treatment/surgery. To me, no question about it. IBC is very aggressive and had rapidly progressed in a very short time - so it was chemo (A/C), surgery, chemo (Taxol) which will be the last one of 12 weekly day after tomorrow and then on to rads.
