      "Content": "It is so scary for me. I haven't posted often, I was diagnosed last Feb, with IDC. Stage 1 Gr. 2 E+P+, Her2-. She told me this weekend that she is going on Tuesday for A triple biopsy, the Mammo had showed 3 lumps, One on her right Breast, 2 on the left. She said that she can't feel anything, so Hopefully If they are cancerous, it is early stage. I was so hoping that none of my family would have to experience breast cancer. I am praying that she will not have cancer! I know that if it is,my seven sisters, (3 brothers) will question if it is genetic. Some will freak out! Several of my sisters, have had cysts, some have gone for repeat mammo's. My mom is 81 years old, and I know that if it is cancer, tough decisions will have to be made. Please keep her in your prayers.",

They will help prepare your family in many ways. They explained to my dad feelings that he was having(he had Pancreatic cancer that went to his liver) helped him with his meds, helped my mom and family in explaining the care that he needed, or would need, also they helped arrange for a hospital bed, bath items that he needed at the end of his journey with cancer. They were so caring, and understanding of what our family went through. I can't say enough to the help that he had. Mary",

      "Content": "From my experience, The intial Scan also did not take long. I had to go back to have my small tattoos, and then they did a mock run. Before I started, they took pictures that they keep on file, they took them again at the end of the treatments. I am large chested, and I did experience burns. The Dr. warned me of this because of by large breasts. They were very helpful in giving medicated pads when the burns developed, and they helped alot. I used a cream provided by them. Can't remember the name, but the pads I used were mediplex pads. I often sat with the fan on the area, with my bra off. This helped, but hurt. Don't be afraid to ask if you can take pain meds if you experience the sores. At the end of radiation, it was amazing to me how fast the sored healed up when I stopped radiation I think with in two weeks. Listen to your body! If you are feeling fatigue, rest! I also still have my tan at 5 months out, and still experience swelling. Best wishes to you!",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and radiation fec 2010. My mom had a bi-lateral Mastectomy in January of this year. She was early stage, and didn't need further treatment after surgery. I was her caregiver after surgery. May I suggest that you take a small pillow with you to put under the seat belt on you way home from the hospital? Also you will have drains to remove fluid after surgery, for maybe 1 to 2 weeks, possibly longer. I helped her with that until she could do it on her own. She recovered very well( she is 81). She had not reconstructive surgery after. I wish you the best on your journey, Hugs, Mary",
