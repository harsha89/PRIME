      "Content": "Well...you know what I think. Personally...I dont understand why only 2 rounds and Herceptin is typically taken for a year when HER2+...Im on it already with chemo and I would think you should be too....Im going to have surgery asap after chemo. Yes, my surgeon and onc are talkin..girl, you know your body better than those docs. Those are words spoken directly from the mouth of my Onc Surgeon, lol...so demand it. Dont get pushed around...you own your body! You deserve it..and if you dont like it, get another opinion. Stand up for yourself...wish I was there with ya...Id tell em for ya! Sam",

If it is uncomfortable, take a shower and wash with a moisturizing shampoo..I think that helps. Scrub and more will fall out....then put lotion on head when done. Hope this helps..",

It infuriates me now to think that the insurance companies wont cover these unless you are 40 or have a history. Since my diagnosis, i have been encouraging my young friends to get a mammogram!! Maybe your daughter in law should see someone else. I dont see what the hurt would be to get one...if you ask me, the earlier the better. I wish I would have...even though I found mine very early, I could have found even sooner! Good luck and I hope this helps..",

      "Content": "Yes, I agree with many women here. It depends on what stage you are in and what type of cancer you have. I am HER2 positive and it was never a question for me. The side effects have be very very minimal..no nausea. Just a little constipation, which you can control and a few mouth sores, which is also controlable, and of course the hair loss..and it grows back. We all know you are scared but you can do it. Be strong..I just finished my 6th and final round on tuesday. Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin....you can do it girl. We have faith and you can always seek encouragement from us on here! Hope this helps. Sam",

Our chemo room has tv's also. I find that the people in there are always nice to talk to. Hope this helps...",

I had to get blood drawn, they send results to the doc, see him for exam and questions and blood results, etc and then to the \"chair\" as I call it. No, its not bad...I actually enjoy the visits, its very social, about 6 people or so to a pod and they have people always coming in and out. Nurses are so sweet and fun...I always bring my laptop, cell phone, stuff to do. My treatments take about 4 hours, this includes premeds, and chemo. Remember to drink lots of water starting days prior to treatment, during and after treatment. This helps flush your system...and not that anyone wants to talk about it but I would recommend a stool softener, sooner than later! VERY common side effect I learned about the hard way. If you have questions, all the women on here are amazing. They have been thru it all, and all kinds of treatments....They have been a real help to me and I hope to be able to pass on my knowledge to chemo newbies like yourself! Good luck and stay strong sister Sam",
