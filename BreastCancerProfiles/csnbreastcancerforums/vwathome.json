    "Content": "Hey, I know how you feel -- both boobs are gone, so why am I having chemo? As I mentioned in my last post to you, I went for three opinions, and the answer from all three (two private oncologists and Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) where all the same: To make sure it's all gone. Small cells can migrate and cause cancer in other parts of your body. They still call that breast cancer, because that was the initial cause. I won't lie -- chemo and radiation sucked big time, and I am having some not-to-pleasant side effects from tamoxifen, like weight gain and being on an emotional roller-coaster (my sister calls it the Waaah Factor -- I start to cry at the drop of a hat) but you know what? The whole time, I just kept on telling myself, \"I am killing cancer cells.\" I still do tell myself that, whenever I pop a tamoxifen. To me, it's part of doing everything I can to lick this. I just had my one-year-out-of-treatment check-up, and all is looking good, and I will do everything I can to keep it that way. Hang in there, sweetie, you will get through the chemo and the radiation, and will rejoice in the invention of elastic waists on pants. It's a few months out of your life, to help you have many more years. Good luck, and remember that there are people you don't even know quietly rooting for you.",
