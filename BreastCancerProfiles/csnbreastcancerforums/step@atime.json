      "Content": "I have had the gel implants put in and love them! My PS did a great job! Now need to decide whether to tattoo or reconstruct nipples then tattoo. If I reconstruct, it will take care of a couple of little imperfections from the reconstruction. I worry, though, about having constant \"headlights.\" I have been told that after I have the nipples reconstructed it is likely that the nipples will always stick out. concept of wearing a t-shirt without a bra is really great, but I am afraid that will go away if I have nipple reconstruction. On the other hand, I have seen really good 3D tattoos and really bad 3D tattoos. I don't want to look \"fake.\" Two \"dots\" on each side doesn't sound very attractive. What are some thoughts?",

      "Content": "I had a port placed in my chest in July for chemo infusion when I had my bilateral mastectomy. It has been a lifesaver!!! I will have it through probably Dec. 2010 due to Herceptin infusions through August. It will be another little procedure to have it removed and I am not going to let this stuff slow me down, so it will probably be during a school holiday weekend when I have it removed. My question is: Does anyone know if there is any metal in the construction of the port? I have looked online, but can't find what the silly little thing is made of. Odd story, our principal reminded us to wear our nametags. When I finally found mine (magnetic and I had stuck it on the top of the door frame of my classroom so I wouldn't lose it!) I put it on and went about my day. My left arm started aching, then my shoulder and neck. It felt like something was pulling on my shoulder and I felt awful. At the end of school, thinking nothing of it, took off the nametag. Half an hour later, I feel great. Day 2 and 3, same thing. It was bumping my port a little, so I moved it to the right side on day 4. 30 minutes, I felt fine. That's when I started wondering about metals. It is no big deal to wear it on the right side. Everybody in school (town) knows who I am anyway and was shocked I could find the thing in the first place! :-) Just curious...... (one more weird story in the list of stories. I'll classify this one with the little magnets in the expanders setting off my son's bakkugans!)",
