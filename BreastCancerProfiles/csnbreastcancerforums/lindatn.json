      "Content": "Hi, It sounds like you are walking where I have been. I finished radiation on Dec of last year, one year out soon. In any case I likewise am a 40D, lumpectomy, A/C and Tamoxifen. When I finished radiation all looked fine but for burning under the breast. Went on a long car trip for Christmas, while gone the breast swelled huge and very painful. That was the beginning of more tests, antibotics, did no good, and me buying 25 different bras, none were the least bit wearable but the cheap Wal-Mart sports bras. Did wear a very tight high priced sports bra when the swelling was the worst. I've had three mammograms and two ultrasounds this year, fluid in the breast, and a seroma. I ran into a gal who did my last mammogram at Sarah Cannon who had this same problem five years ago. She said wait until you were one year out and it will improve and after five years nearly normal. My breast was red, hot, nipple area very strange looking. Saved the best for last still most of the time in the sport bras[kind of like them] but no more pain, fairly normal color, a bit bigger, but not ten pounds heavier. The nipple doesn't look so hot but at 60 I can live with it. Hang in there it will get better you just have awhile to go. Love Linda",

      "Content": "This subject has been discussed by many of us so I will throw my hat back in the ring. Many Drs and people feel if you are er+ you should stay away from lentils, soy products etc etc. Plant estrogens might be the answer to why we wouldn't get cancer. No money in that research so it is only done by a few very rare researchers. There is more then one estrogen in our body. Instead of studying endless new money making chemos here would be a place to start. As far as sugar in all foods, just about, I only buy fresh fruit and vegetables, rice milk, and flour at the health food store. I bake our bread, make fruit shakes for breakfast. We eat very well, a lot of brown rice and beans, we do eat eggs and fresh cold water fish. No other meat, dairy, or anything with sugar. We have been eating this way for two years, have very low blood pressure, below 150 cholesterol. The other side of the coin is it might do no good and we sure will have missed out on a lot of chocolate and ice cream. Melons, berries and nuts make good treats and snacks. There is a good natural sweetner called Stevia to sweeten our green tea, five cups of tea a day, some proven facts that it helps in killing off cancer cells blood supply. I eat Tofu, lentils and chick peas but leave soy protein powders alone. Just had my two and a half year mammogram today so far so good, I am ER+ also had stageIII aggressive tumor. A lot of prayer and just talking to nature keeps us feeling good.If God didn't make it don't eat it. Linda",

      "Content": "It surprises me to no end that the Suasan G.Komen Foundation is encouraging anyone to eat refined sugar. First off all to many of us are on Tamoxifen and fight a weight problem plus estrogen is stored in fat so we don't need a extra pound. Cancer needs sugar to grow and we don't want that at any cost. What the candy cost give to the foundation, all of it! Go buy fresh unsalted peanuts. I'm sure the Komen foundation can raise money without doing harm to everyones health. Toilet paper sounds like a good plan! If God didn't make it don't eat it. Blessings to all. Linda",

      "Content": "When I was first dx with cancer two and a half years ago my GP who is in his late fifties who had worked at a cancer center in Canada told me this. He also told me that cancer can't live in a body that is kept alkaline and grows when your body is acidic. He would not go into this any further so I started a in depth study on alternative care and cancer cures. All of these natural cures tell you to never eat any refined food, most say no meat or milk but for rice and soymilk of course. When you consult alternative DRs the diet is all fresh foods and orgainic of course. Did you know that ten years ago Israel banned all pesticides and their cancer rate has been cut in half, are we listening NO. Husband and I have both had cancer and we are listening but difficult to do in this country plus I am a long way from a large city to buy organic so I do a lot of washing fresh foods. Never drink water but distilled, you can keep very busy trying to sort it all out but refined sugar, which is in almost everything you look at if you check the labels, I don't think any of us need it, diabets is on the rise in this country to the point it is unbelieval etc etc. Food for thought and God Bless.

      "Content": "Idalia, Please explain why you have given up all those wonderful foods, what makes you think tomatoes,carrots, whole wheat,brown rice, sweet potatoes and oats are harmful to you? In turn you are eating refined foods, please explain I am confused. The soy issue is completely unproved, why do the women in Asia have so much less cancer until they move to our way of eating? The first generation in America does not get cancer the second starts to and by the third it is the same. I am er+ I eat soy not everyday but I do eat lentils and chickpeas etc. Having come from a farm background I leave meatand milk alone every calf is implanted with a growth hormone, every chick is put on antibotic in the water and feed the first day they are hatched, most milk cows have hormone implants to increase milk production almost all farms are sprayed with weed killers etc etc. We all go about living each day the best we can and pray to have many more.

      "Content": "Angela to answer your questions, distilled water can be bought in gallons almost anywhere, Wal-mart is where I buy mine and I have a tiny store so sure all of them have it. Most grorcery stores likewise. Remember we used it in steam irons. The PH Balance testing tape can be bought in most any drug store or from vitamin catalogs. You test saliva and urine there is a chart on the package telling you how to read it. Any natural Health page on the internet will give you a list of foods that form ash or alkaline with recommended 10-20 percent intake daily be acid the balance alkaline. Will any of this keep us from getting cancer back or cure us I don't have the answer to that but I do wish they would spend equal amount of money researching why we get cancer and how to prevent it. Much reasearch needs to be done on herbs and vitamins in treating and preventing. Nearly all research money is spent now on how to nearly kill us off to cure it and they don't have all that great of track record. I had a fairly large tumor and two nodes so I am willing to try a different life style. Husband was given six to eight years if he took Lupron he refused but did have radiation. He did take Lupron for three months and said if that is how he was going to feel he would rather take a chance on dying. I wasn't ready to let him go that easy. One year out of treatment starting PSA was 60 still at .03 so we can hope and pray. Linda",

      "Content": "Wildangel, You are doing a whole lot more right then worng dear. We go with green tea over coffe, four cups a day, don't skip lunch have a big green salad with all those good foods and a vinegar, olive oil dressing with a little Stevia sweetner, Stevia is natural, Spenda is a man made product. When did you finish chemo it affects cholesterol for some months, mine was 242 after chemo which was surprising to me but once again GP answered the questions I had on that and assured me it would go back down. I asked the cancer Dr and she said I don't know! Two years later it is below 150. I don't like the fact that the goverment has raised the safety level twice in my life time on how much lead and arsenic is safe in our water supply I will get my minerals elsewhere as for sodium we all get more then we need. Can't find food without sugars just go to fresh fruits and vegetables, oatmeal, and other grains and bake your own bread. The word cancer scares me far more then talking about food ever could. Since I am worrying some of you I won't post on this subject again if anyone wants to write to me my email address is:elton@twlakes.net. God Bless Linda",

      "Content": "Hi gals, thank for checking up on me! The cancer was pretty bad in the liver over 75 percent of the liver had some cancer plus two large tumors, after four treatments with taxterene and carbopallium, both spelled wrong, some thing never change! Also had a couple spots on my bones and a enlarged node in my chest. They did a CT after four treatments, the bones were clear, node half the size and liver tumors reduced by 50 percent. I have chemo two weeks on and one week off, kind of hard but keep up the house and meals, don't work in my kennel, husband is feeling a bit over worked. We are praying for complete healing after all Jesus died so we wouldn't have to be sick if we can believe strong enough God will heal. I have had seven chemos so far bloodwork is better, liver function is better and the CA tumor marker has gone from 1140 to 480. How is Jade? It does sound as if when a person gets cancer more and more trouble follows, my husband had prostate cancer in 2003 where I had the first bc in 2002. Keep me in your prayers as I will your sister Sue and all the rest of us fighting for our lives and good news at every check up. God Bless Linda",
