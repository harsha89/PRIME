I will wear hats too. But, like pitt, I will want to make my own, or have my sister make them. I'm thinking of tye-dying them. I've been on youtube looking at how to tie scarves and how to tie-dye fabric. I even watched how to make a scarf out of a tee shirt. Do you have any other ways to make scarves?",
