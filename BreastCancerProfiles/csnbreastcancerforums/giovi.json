    "Content": "Hello Jayne: I am a 52 years old woman from Puerto Rico. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2000. I had 4 chemo treatments, 36 radiotherapies and another 4 of chemo. I finished my last chemo on July 11 2001. I am writing because I, like you, had my hair straight and now is growing very curly, but I have noticed that is growing very very slow. Since last December I have not wear my wig, I was 1 year wearing it. My cancer, like yours, has deepen my relationship with God, I am a better person now thanks to my cancer. I am still working and although I don't have children, my husband has been very supportive, i don't knw how I could manage this cancer without his help. I will pray for you, Love, Giovanna",
