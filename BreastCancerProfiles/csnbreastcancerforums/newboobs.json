      "Content": "Chris, tamoxifen can cause severe birth defects - so you need to be really careful. I just finished 3 yrs on TAM and am anxious as well to try to have a baby-- I am 41 and have no children yet. But after weighing it out, we've decided to finish the TAM's 5 yrs and then try. If it's meant to be at that time, it will happen. Remember, you want to do all you can to survive so you can be a great mom! Good luck and prayers to you.",

      "Content": "I had the sentinel node biopsy- where they inject a blue dye into the area where my tumor was. Then they use a special \"black light\" to see if the fluid flows to any nodes. If nodes light up, they remove them. I'm not well versed on all the technical info, but I hope this helps. All of my nodes didn't light up, but my surgeon took 9 nodes because they were swollen, biopsy showed they were negative. Hugs lynne!",
