    "Content": "Unfortunately, spammers have once again targeted CSN. There have been almost continuous bot attacks on CSN, some so severe as to cause the site to go down (which is their goal).  Our IT team has been searching for and adding more security measures the last 4-5 days--night, day and through the weekend. Apparently, because we're an online community, have a high volume of visitors and have been the target of major attacks in the past, we are at high risk for future attacks. The IT team has a game plan to avert most of the attacks but I'm not sure of the timeline for completion. Very soon I should think. As for people using CSN private messages to spam/scam you... If you get weird email that doesn't feel right or make any sense, please let me know immediately. Send me a CSN pm with the username of the person and the nature of their letter. In addition, you can post it on the board to give others a heads up. We've had men looking for women, women looking for men, people asking for money or other help, selling products and services, promoting themselves/their business, researchers recruiting subjects for studies, journalists wanting to interview you, media people enticing you to be in a film/documentary, trying to convert you to follow them in whatever they are doing or believe in, etc. CSN prohibits the use of its site for solicitation of any kind. Best, Greta  ",
