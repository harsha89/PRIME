      "Content": "Oh no, you are not a bad caregiver!!  You are a very worried daughter who thinks the world of her Mother and loves her very much!  I too was just dx with breast cancer in early Sept. and it has been a whirlwind.  Things moving very fast and I have had good days and bad days and the worst is waiting on test results.  I have had the lumpectomy surgery last wednesday and my vascular port just put in this morning.  There have been so many biopsies, xrays and procedures and my daughter has been with me through it all!  My daughter and I were talking the other day and she was crying about my diagnosis after surgery (Stage 2B with positive lymph node).  I told her that between the two of us that she now has the hardest job because she has to witness a loved one go through pain.  Prior to this I was always a very healthy person who was a caregiver to my Mom, Mother-in-Law & husband.  My husband and Mom are still with us but sadly we lost my Mother-in-Law 20 yrs ago when she lost her 5 yr battle with breast cancer. So I just wanted to say that I have been on both sides of this dreadful unpredictable disease but the treatments and positive outcomes and quality of life are so much better now than then.  Just keep \"being\" there for your mom and let her know you love her and would do anything for her.  She knows that you can't \"fix\" anything (that's for the Dr's and nurses) she just needs you to be with her.      God Bless -Edna",
