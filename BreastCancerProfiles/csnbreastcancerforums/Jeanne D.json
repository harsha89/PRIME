      "Content": "I am so very, very sorry that you had a recurrence of breast cancer. I have also had breast cancer twice, once in 1985 and then again in 2009. My 2nd bc is a new cancer, not a recurrence, which is suppose to make me feel better. Guess what, it doesn't. I totally understand how you feel. I felt so different after my 1st with bc, but, getting bc again really changes that. A 2nd go around with it is a whole new ballgame. I had a lumpectomy and 25 rads in 85. Tamox was experimental then and not offered. I had 2 lumpectomy's in 09 with 37 rad treatments. The first one was to remove the cancer and the 2nd was to remove some cysts that appeared. I just had that in Nov. 09. I have a couple of new lumps now in that breast, but, they are pretty sure it is just tissue, so, they are injecting me with a steroid to break them up and soften them. It is working so far. Please know that we are all here to support and help you, day or night. You are not alone..never! I chose this time to not have any nodes removed for testing and to not take tamox. It was what I felt was best for me. I have more of my story on my Expressions Page if you'd like to read it. Please private message me if I can be of any help to you. I will be praying for you! Let us know what you do and how you proceed with your treatment. We are all your pink bc sisters now! And, we are a great group of fighters! God bless you! Love, Jeanne ♥",

I didn't have a mastectomy, I had a lumpectomy, so, I can't really offer you help about exercises for your situation. Your oncologist and plastic surgeon should be able to offer you help about what exercises you can or should be doing. Have you talked to them? And, I am sure that the other bc ladies on here will chime in with help for you. Once again, welcome and good luck to you! Love, Jeanne ♥",

The rest of the area did get pink, but, never burnt. I also got what they called radiation dermatitis which was awful itchy bumps that were worse than the rads themselves. But, my rads oncologist gave me something for that and it cleared up. All I could use was Biafine and Aquaphor, which I used from day one of my rads and continued for about 1 month afterwords. I used the Biafine mainly during the day, and, the Aquaphor at night as it is so greasy. Anything you wear with it will be almost ruined, so, wear an old tshirt or something that you can wash in HOT or just throw away afterwords. Get lots of rest as rads will zap your energy, even worse than chemo. Take naps if you can and get to bed as early as you can. My skin now is just like a baby's behind. It is great! So, just use your creams, get lots of rest and be gentle with that side of your body. I just used Dove soap and used my hand to go over it. I didn't use a wash cloth. Good luck Traci!

The one that he gave me the shots in last time is gone, which is a huge relief. Now, just one more lump to go and I am praying that it will be gone after this round of shots. I think David might wear gloves this time. I think I hurt him the last time when I not only squeezed his hand reallyyyyyyyyyy hard, but, I sunk my nails into his hand. I said I was sorry. Geeshhhhhhhh I miss the RAD B's! That was a fun thread, wasn't it? And, TJ's quest for pictures of us at all ages. Fun stuff! It is good that we move on somewhat, don't you think? But, I will always be some part of this site as it helped me thru so much. I owe all of you, everyone on here, all that I can give when needed. So Stef, your flock has come home! We all love you, a LOT! Love, Jeanne ♥ P. S. My new avatar pic is of one of the hearts that David made in the snow for me for Valentine's Day. He had them all over the acreage here so that I would see one out of any and all of the windows whenever I looked out! It was the best gift ever!",

I know the fear and pain of it, but, life is so beautiful, that we all must fight, fight as hard as we can to conquer the beast and to live, to actually live! If your children are upsetting you, or, if anyone is, please have a strong heart to heart talk with them and tell them exactly how you feel. You have to be honest about everything and with everyone. I will add you to my prayer list at church. Stay positive Linda! Love, Jeanne ♥",

You will get thru this and move forward and be the wonderful, beautiful Mimi that we all know and love. I don't know why we all think that we have to be so strong and so perfect thru this, because that is not possible. We have to allow ourselves to be down, allow ourselves to be out of sorts, allow ourselves to be sad and angry. Look at what we are up against! Look at what we have put our poor bodies and minds thru! Mimi, you are one of the brightest stars on this forum. You will be shining bright again! Just allow yourself to be a little dim for a small amount of time and vent your feelings here. But, you will return and be that bright star again on this board. Don't be so hard on yourself. We will all be here for you! Love, Jeanne ♥",
