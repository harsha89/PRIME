    "Content": "As you can see, there are so many of us who have been in your shoes. 1. My experiences just following surgery were that I was so grateful for pain meds. They really to make things bearable. They keep the pain to a level of discomfort rather than stabbing pain, so don't worry about that. Just take them on time. Time is hospital is totally dependant on you and my docs said I could stay as long as I needed, just let them know if I need to stay and they will take care of the rest. 2. Two weeks after surgery, well I'm almost 2 weeks post op and I need about 1/3 of the pain meds. And you know what I did today, I took a walk in this beautiful sunshine and my husband took me to see the movie 2012. For such MAJOR surgery, it hasn't been as bad for me as I expected. I would not plan to have a big dinner scheduled at your home, but you will probably be able to make something simple and take to dinner elsewhere. 3. Drama, let them help you if you need it, and take care of the things you feel like taking care of, otherwise you'll never get rid of them. Ha. Start stretching now so you have better range of motion after surgery. Then keep the stretching up after surgery. I wouldn't be as far along in my recover had I not planned ahead. Best of luck with your venture. Joy",
