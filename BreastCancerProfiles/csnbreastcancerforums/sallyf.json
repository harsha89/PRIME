    "Content": "Thank you so much, Pitt You may have read my post titled Meltdown, and your words have helped me a lot (as have those contributors on the meltdown topic). Tomorrow is my next chemo, and I am going to take your advice, let my body release its fears when it needs to, AND move forward every day.

With love from Santa Barbara, Sally",
