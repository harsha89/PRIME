    "Content": "In 1995 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Went through chemo, then was put on Tamoxifen, then in 2000 I was diagnosedd with uterine cancer which my oncologist said was caused by the Tamoxifen that I had been taking. Stayed on the tamoxifen, then in 2002 I started experiencing shortness of breath, Xrays showed my left lung was 2/3 filled with fluid. Cancer had spread to the pleural cavity of my left lung. Was then put on Femara and as soon as I started taking it, I started experiencing terrible muscular-skeletal pain, and fatigue. My oncologist then put me on celebrex and lortab for the pain. Helped some, not much. Are there any women out there who have experienced the same symptoms, and do you know if there is any kind of medication that I can take that will ease this pain. I never feel good any more. I am 56 years old and have 2 precious grandchildren and I want to enjoy them, but I just don't feel like doing anything any more. Will someone please give me some advise? My oncologist referred me to my regular family physician. My family physician IS NOT an oncologist!!! I would think the oncologist should know what to do. I'm so tired of all this pain. Will someone please give me some advice? Thanks and God bless all of you. You are in my prayers. God has been with me through all of this in the past, so I know He will continue to take care of me and help me. My email address is brenrandpb@aol.com.",
