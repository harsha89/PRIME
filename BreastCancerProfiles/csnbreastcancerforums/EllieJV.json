    "Content": "I just got the news on Weds., that I have \"invasive ductal with some pre-invasive cells\". My tumor is 1 cm. That's it. That's all I know. I am reading everything I can find. I am beyond scared, because of course, a little knowledge CAN be a dangerous thing, especially if you don't have the full story. I am sitting here, waiting patiently to hear back about my follow-up appt with a surgeon. That's how \"new\" I am. :-) I do go to MD Anderson, so I am not worried about the hospital, or the MD's, it is just the waiting that is starting to take it's toll. And, I know I have a LOT of waiting ahead of me. I just wanted to say \"HI\" and to let you know, I will be picking your brains, once I know what to be picking at. And hopefully, you will bring some smiles into my life, and I can bring some to you. Because I feel strongly, if you can't find at least ONE thing every day to laugh about, even if only to yourself, you are in serious trouble. ;-) So, hello. And know, your discussions here help a LOT of people who lurk, until the get the courage enough to come in outta' the dark, and say \"HI\"! Thanks for everything you have already put in print. It helps. Ellie",
