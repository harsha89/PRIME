    "Content": "I too love this site for the immediate answers to \"everything\". I've gone on chat rooms and and have found them talking about everything BUT breast CA. Some. while not the ACS site, were very snarky and way off subject--- heck, I can get that at the supermarket. BUT, I found an absolutely great breast CA group in my small town. It's extremely supportive, there is always someone to call, and the support and hugs at the meetings are immeasurable. I have heard that you need to go to a couple of meetings before you decide if it's for you. I guess I got lucky! Thank you all for being ready to give great advice from experience and the heart---and at 2am in your pj's ;>} ((((BIG HUGS)))))",
