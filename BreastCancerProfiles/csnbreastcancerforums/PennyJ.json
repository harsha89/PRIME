    "Content": "Hello everyone, I feel a little unsure about mooing about my problems when there are folks here dealing w/ much more difficult stuff, but here goes.  All through treatment I have had trouble w/ weird or very intense side effects w/ chemo and associated meds.  I had bilateral mastectomies in January 2012 finished chemo in March 2012 and radiation in May 2012.  I started Tamoxifen back when I was diagnosed in Oct 2011 but was advised to stop in Jan 2012 until after the rest of my treatment was over as I developed a rapid heart rate and high blood pressure and my MO thought the Tamoxifen might be contributing.  Started generic Arimidex in July 2012 and did ok for a while, just wrist and elbow pain.  However, over the past several months the pain had spread to most of my joints and muscles and the fatigue was so bad I would come home for lunch and lay down for a 1/2hr, go back to work and then come home and go to bed.  My MO had me stop the Arimidex.  I had nasty migraines for the 1st wk, still pain on the 2nd week and then felt really good on wk 3.  I then started Aromasin.  I only lasted a week w/ severe pain in my upper spine that woke me from a sound sleep and didn't go away w/ ibuprofen or tylenol.  Stopped the Aromasin after just the 1wk (per MO), it has now been another week and I have pain throughout my entire spine, knee and ankle joints, and leg muscles.  I'm now scheduled for a bone scan on Thursday to be sure that I don't have a spinal compresssion fracture and/or recurrance in my bones.  I've tried to be upbeat through this whole thing (including the hospitalizations for chemo side effects) but I admit I am feeling pretty discouraged.  I got through everything by looking forward to being able to do \"normal people\" things (like gardening and projects around the house) when it was all over and that's just not happening.  I am having all I can do to make it through the work day and had to call in several times last week.  I am hoping that the spine pain is just another weird medication side effect d/t the aromasin, especially because it came on so fast, but I am scared that it could be bone mets.  I am so very tired.  Thanks for listening.  My family is wonderful and they know what's going on, but I don't want to burden/worry them more than I already have w/ just how bad and discouraged I feel about all of this.  I'll let you know how things turn out. Thanks, Penny",
