    "Content": "Hello All, I need some information please. I have a friend that was DX with breast cancer, stage 2 aggressive.She had a lumpectomy She finished treatment with chemo and radiation. She is doing very well, just a bit tired at times. Otherwise she is very active. My question to all?? After you had surgery, chemo, and possibly radiation, Did your oncologist follow up with tests to see if there was any cancer activity in the original site, and possibly other sites of the body. Such as colonscopy, especially a Pet Scan to see for active cancer cells??? Is there any other tests she should have???? Let me say, I am a cancer survivor, DX in Sept 2009, remission Jan 2011. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Let the angels and my prayers guide you on a path to recovery. Thank you for any information you can give me. Maggie",
