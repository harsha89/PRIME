Don't know if you believe God is with you but that is what gets me through a lot of tough trials in my life. Please know I truly feel for you and wish I could help you.

Now you all in Iowa will wonder .. \"is it ME?\" I am so happy to have found this site. I was so alone as my daughters think I only had a small thing happen to me. Been since July and they still think it is no big deal. My husband and I had to deal alone with the whole thing. Even surgery (lumpectomy Aug. 3rd). He needed some support and never got any from them either. So with dear friends and people like all of you I don't feel quite so alone. I don't want pity just some support and understanding. Feel so lost some days. Thank God the doctor got the cancer and nothing in nodes. Radiation was the pits and had e-coli for a few weeks after that. Dirty radiation room my general Doctor thinks. Any way that is gone. Now I have a crazy rash on my legs. What next???? Any way THANK YOU ALL for listening to me off and on. I send all my Prayers and good wishes to All of You.
