    "Content": "Right now, this minute this is a funny story but this morning I wasn't sure what to do. I had my first Chemo last week. This morning I decided to call my onco because I was having stomach pain when I eat or drink. I find the papers they gave me last week to get a quick phone number for the doctor, thinking they may need other info from that paper - ie account #, patient #, etc. The paper I used contained all my lab work results so it certainly should have updated information on it. I dial the number, 2 3 4 - 5 6 7 8 (don't try that number - it isn't the real number). The phone is answered. The recording tells me...\"I'm sorry the number you have dialed has been disconnected\". Now that sure made my stomach pain go away quickly. When I did reach their office, I did mention that their print outs needed some updating.",
