      "Content": "God is faithful and He is good. I still had bristles when I had my friend Becky give me a buzz cut when I knew my hair was starting to come loose. I didn't want to be shedding clumps of hair; I preferred the bristles. Actually, I had three guests that day, which probably was a help to me in staying positive about all of this. Another thing that helped, I think, was that I had made the decision to go ahead and get a buzz and got it a little sooner than maybe I needed to; but I had enough evidence that my hair was going to fall out. I had a terrycloth cap I wore at night to catch the bristles that might rub off through the night. I think what bothered me most about the prospect of losing my hair was that I no longer would have some control over who knew my plight. People I did not even know would know. I did not want people feeling sorry for me. I managed to let go, and I was all right with it. I do have a sense of humor, and that was a help to me in so many ways -- not that I laughed or made smart remarks a lot, but by doing so, I knew I was all right, as did my friends and family. I realized that this was all part of having to do chemo. I did not have any real choice in the matter, if I wanted to go through the plan my DR had. This was not the only time I told myself this, but I know this was one of the times I told myself to JUST DEAL WITH IT! THIS IS HOW IT IS FOR NOW. EVENTUALLY IT WILL ALL BE IN THE PAST. You will do fine. It just is a step by step process we all work through at different rates. e",

My few days of queasiness tended to be a few days after an infusion and only lasted maybe three or four days.  I was on adriamycin/cytoxan infusions at the start.  When I was switched to taxol -- the plan midway -- I did not have any need of the anti-puke pills, and I had no queasiness. We all are different, and so others may post other thoughts; but I always think it is good to get a broad picture of the situation, as you will be able to figure out where you fit.",

Anyhow, this is why it seems to me I ought to be able to rate my general health at least the level I was before the bc episode.  Anyone have any thoughts?",

All involved in the process were vigilant about my skin.  I started using Miaderm from Day 1.  Now that I look back at it, I probably could have used it more liberally. I ran into some burn problems near the end. They were not such that they kept me from finishing on time.  I was at the point of shifting to the boost, and so the first area was no longer going to be hit with rays.  The nurse/doctor had me do this to treat the burns:  pat the area lightly with very diluted hydrogen peroxide.  (I forget the proportions.)  Then I covered the area with silvadene and gauze and left it for about 4 hours.  Then I took that off, cleaned the area again (with the diluted peroxide).  I left it uncovered for about 4 or so hours.  Then I would do the cleaning and silvadene again.  It worked out that I did not wear the silvadene/gauze through the night. When I would go for the five final boosts, I had to be sure not to have the silvadene and gauze on.  I'd get to the radiation oncologist's office and the nurse would check it (as did the ones doing the radiation) before I had the boost to be sure there were no signs of infection AND that the area was not where the rays were being targeted.  After therapy a nurse would clean the burned area and carefully clean away the dead skin. I knew when the same thing was happening because of the boosts; and so I automatically began the same care as for the other area, which healed quickly.  I had a few follow-up appointments just to be sure no infection was developing.  The dead skin was removed as well.  That area healed quickly as well. I do recall that there were some who had to postpone radiation therapy for a bit because of their burns.  I have no idea what they may or may not have done to prevent or minimize the problem.  ",

      "Content": "  I had taxol four times, after having adriamycin and cytoxim four times.  With taxol, I discovered that I did not have the few days of queasiness each time that I had with AC.  So, I no longer took the anti-puke pills I took a few days after each round of AC. I did continue to drink a lot of water, just because I thought it was a smart thing to do. I was closely watched the first day I had taxol, in case I had a reaction of some sort.  I didn't -- until the final two times.  In those instances, I was given extra benadryl (twice) and then demerol (once) and was able to get back on track. It seemed to me to take longer get get the taxol in my system than the AC.  I usually had someone who volunteered to  drive me to my appointment and just hang with me.  We passed the time chatting, watching HGTV on the small tv in my room, and working on puzzles or reading.  I found I would eat a little better if I did not pack lunch for me.  So, I would make my list of items and give some $$ to my companion for the day (usually one of my sisters-in-law) and tell her to get lunch for herself as well.  We dined on fare from Wendy's, Taco Bell, McDonald's, and Burger King.  I tended to choose items that would still be good, if eating was delayed because I happened to be dozing (from the extra drugs those last two times.) I am not sure if the increase aching in my hips and such for a few days after an infusion was because of the taxol or because of the combined effect of the whole program.  It would last just a few days and was manageable with ibuprofen 800s. Neuropathy can be a problem in the arms/toes, as well as the feets and toes.  I was fortunate to just have some numbness -- still do -- in two of my toes on the right foot.  Compared to what many experience, that really is not bad.  I guess how long it hangs on can vary.  I finished chemo 18 moinths ago. I did find my breathing was affected by the taxol.  I was usually fine, until I'd need to take a deep breath.  Then I would cough.  If I coughed too deeply, then I'd keep coughing.  So, I had to try to keep my coughing less \"hearty.\"  There was twice when I just could not stop the coughing for very long.  Because of the problem with the deep breathing, it was difficult.  I had to move extra slowly those few days to try to keep myself from coughing.  My oncologist had me take a 24-hour allergy pill and that did wonders.  In less than a half day, I was doing much better.  Because that had happened after taxol #2 and #3, after taxol #4 I got a jump on things (because my husband and I had plans to head out of town for a few days).  I took allergy pills, starting the day before it had last time.  In other words, I would have the problems 10 days after an infusion (had those every other week), usually a Friday was the start day.  At that time I would be at my oncologist's anyhow (blood check for the Monday infusion), and so he had me do the allergy pills (second time he added musinex), as needed.   What I did, to try to keep it from happening again, was be pro-active.  I began the allergy pill on Wednesday, the day we were leaving on our trip.  I took a pill each day we were away.  I had no problems.  The oncologist said that it is not uncommon with taxol for there to be an increase of mucus, which leads to the extra coughing. I think that is about all I have to share about taxol and me.  Hope you fare well. e  ",

He was reviewing with me that he planned to use tamoxafen the first 2.5 years of hormonal therapy (started in August) and then switch to another drug. It sounded like the name started with an O. It will be interesting to see if, with these reports out, he changes his mind by that midway point.",

      "Content": "I did have some burns to contend with from the rads; but because the boosts zeroed in in an area a little different from the rads (just below), I was able to continue on schedule. The burns from my rads were a little more intense than what you are experiencing.  I had a few \"wet\" spots as I neared the end of that phase.  So, those were addressed, and I did heal quickly from that.  Near the end of the boost, I started to show signs of a small \"wet\" spot or two.  Because I knew what I was to do about the larger area (from the rads), I started that in the boost area.  I had just completed the boosts when that occurred.  Those spots healed up even more quickly. I will say that in my rads area, I did get quite sore.  That was most evident when I was riding in the car over bumpy roads in our rural areas.  That, too, disappeared rather quickly. During my rads time, I did encounter patients who had had a problem with burns -- enough of a problem that their rads had to be postponed for a bit to allow healing.  I thought I was fortunate to not have that happen to me. We all are different; but I know that anything any of us share helps give people like you a bit of an idea of what may occur and how we dealt with that. Hang in there!  ",

      "Content": "Luke 2:1-20  (NIV)The Birth of Jesus  In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while[a] Quirinius was governor of Syria.)  7And everyone went to their own town to register.  So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.  And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, \u201cDo not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.  Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.\u201d  Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,  \u201cGlory to God in the highest heaven,   and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.\u201d  When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.\u201d  So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.    ",
