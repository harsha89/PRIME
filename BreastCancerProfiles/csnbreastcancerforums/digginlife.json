    "Content": "My fianc√©e is a twelve year breast cancer survivor who is doing research for her PhD. Her topic involves understanding the cultures of the following third world countries, Ghana, Angola, Sierra Leona, Liberia, Guinea, and Senegal. She has been told twice by two different doctors, once in 1997 and again in 2003 that travel to any third world country was not recommended. We have a doctors appointment set for next week and we will be asking about third world travel again. I would like to know if anyone knows of any new research or data that has been published on the subject of third world travel for those with auto immune problems?",
