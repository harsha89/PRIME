    "Content": "I sure hope crying is healthy. I have never been a crier but since my diagnosis anything may bring on the tears and for at least 2 months, I cried every day. It seemed to make me even more sad, so my new philosophy is to replace the tears with a laugh. A good joke everyday or some silly comedy on TV, I am trying to reserve the tears for those really down days(like 4 different doctors appt. this week). so instead of the hormonal cry look for a laugh to replace the tears. I have some good friends who send me email jokes or silly cards on a regular basis.",
