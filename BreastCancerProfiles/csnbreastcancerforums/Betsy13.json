All I can say it hang in there, beat this beast, vent when you need to. We are here for support. Personally, I don't know what I would have done without this site. It is my only support. I'll be praying for you, Betsy",

      "Content": "I have been searching in my area since last Feb. and there is no support group closer than 50 miles away. NO ONE should go through this alone. I am alone. I read these great stories about one woman came home from the hospital and her friends and cleaned her house from top to bottom; another woman said that she had someone to take her to radiation and take her home; another one said that her in-laws were indespensible; yet another about her best friend drove 400 miles every other week and brought her 2 weeks worth of dinners...I feel so sorry for myself because I have had none of that. No one did anything to help. I am starting over making new friends. I still feel like crap. I still have zero support at work. I still can't take time off to get rested. I am so afraid that I am going to keel over dead. But what really scares me is that no one will care. I will not be missed. I am alone and lonely. I hurt so deep in my soul that I don't know what to do. There is no group or person to help me through what I feel now. Barbara Delinsky sent me a copy of her \"Uplift\" book and I couldn't read it because it depressed me so much. Life is unbearable and I don't know where to turn. My husband gets mad at me now because I am so exhausted when I come home from work Friday night that I don't want to do anything. It's like yeah, you had cancer, no big deal. My life will never be the same, yet it seems to me that they don't want to have a clue. I don't know. I just don't know what to do or where to turn for help. I thought I'd vent here again. Life can be hard sometimes, but should it be this hard? Thanks for listening, Betsy",

      "Content": "Hi Kim, I didn't have chemo, but I did have 33 radiation treatments. I, too, am a teacher but work full time. During my radiation, I worked. I did not have support with work. My rad. onc. wanted me to not work, but my students really wanted me to. I ended up working every other day and had the same sub. She was great with the kids. On the days where I was just exhausted, I would tell my students and they rose to the occasion. I teach 8th grade math/science. Unfortunately, it is Aug. 4 and I am still suffering from major fatigue. I am beginning to think I slowed my recovery because I did not take time off during treatment. I would recommend getting a steady sub and go TDI for a couple of months. This allows you time to recover AND keep your students on track. We had a special ed. instructor take 3/4s of the year off due to health issues. That was too long because the kids go so used to the sub, who was great!, that they refused to give her a chance. The first 2 months of the school year, the kids never had the same sub, so when the long term sub came and he not only knew math but could teach it, it created stability for the kids and they flourished. When the \"real\" teacher came back, she didn't know the kids and she didn't know the math. Not a good situation. No one expected her to come back at all. However, if you can create a situation whereas the students start with one person and then switch to you, they could do that. Very easily, they could do that. Kids are resilient. I hope this helps. Good luck to you, Betsy",

I'm going to my rad. onc. next week so I'm checking with her, but she did tell me that it would be a good year before it was all gone. Every now and then I get a shooting pain, but mainly just aches now. I had lump and rads. Hope this helps, Betsy",
